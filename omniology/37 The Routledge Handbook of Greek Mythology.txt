PREFACE

Although this is essentially a new book in its present form, I originally embarked
on it with the intention of producing a revised version of H.J. Rose’s classic Handbook
of Greek Mythology, and the ﬁnal product remains indebted to that work in many
respects, incorporating some material from it and following its general plan in parts,
especially in the chapters on divine mythology. Herbert Jennings Rose (1883–1961),
who was professor of Greek at St Andrews from 1927 to 1953, wrote extensively
on ancient religion and mythology, publishing an edition of Hyginus’ mythological
manual in 1928, and was also an accomplished translator who introduced works of
notable continental scholars such as M.P. Nilsson and R. Pettazzoni to an English-
speaking audience. He remarks in the preface to his mythological handbook that he
felt impelled to write it because, as a teacher of Classics, he had often felt handi-
capped by the lack of book of moderate length containing an accurate account of
Greek mythology in accordance with the results of modern research; and the
resulting volume, which was ﬁrst published in 1928, certainly fulﬁlled a need among
students and others who were interested in the subject. It has continued to be of
service, moreover, in more recent times, even though many books of a related kind
have been published since it ﬁrst appeared, including various dictionaries of clas-
sical mythology and the two-volume surveys of Robert Graves (which has proved
very popular in spite of its eccentricities) and Carl Kerényi (the second volume of
which, The Heroes of the Greeks, was translated into English by Rose himself). After
it had remained in print for seventy years, however, its present publishers thought
it desirable that it should be revised to take account of advances in knowledge and
the changing needs of its readership. The book has inevitably come to seem old-
fashioned or even unreliable in certain respects. To take only one example, advances
in archaeology and other disciplines and the decipherment of Linear B (a Mycenaean
script) have affected our understanding of the origins and earliest history of some
of the major gods (see e.g. p. 170). As a guide to the canon of Greek myth, the
book also had one notable shortcoming from the beginning, namely that the coverage
of heroic myth is disproportionately brief, especially when it is considered that Greek
myth as recorded in classical literature consists predominately of heroic legend (for
surprisingly few stories are recorded about the actions of the gods among them-
selves). I therefore undertook to prepare a revised edition by extending the coverage

of this area of myth fairly considerably, with the addition of new chapters, and by
altering or augmenting the text to a more limited extent elsewhere to take account
of changing knowledge and requirements. The outcome turned out to be thoroughly
unsatisfactory, too much of a dog’s dinner to be at all palatable. If the original book
had been blander, such an approach might have proved practicable; but it is in fact
too personal, too idiosyncratic, to be amenable to discreet emendation and augmen-
tation. It was necessary that a few gentle alterations should sufﬁce or else that the
book should be substantially rewritten; and having already progressed some way
along the latter path, I decided to follow it to the end. Although the ﬁnal work
owes more of a debt to Rose’s handbook than may be apparent at ﬁrst sight, and I
value that continuity, it is substantially longer and so different in much of its
approach and content that it cannot be regarded as a replacement or substitute. I
hope, indeed, that Rose’s book may be kept in print for a while yet and perhaps
even attain its centenary.
 The names of deities and heroes and heroines from Greek myth are given in
their original Greek form, except in a very few cases where it would seem absurdly
pedantic to do so. Please see the introduction to the index for remarks on the pronun-
ciation of Greek names and on the relationship between Greek and Latinized forms
of those names. In the case of geographical names and the names of mythical and
historical peoples, Anglicized and Latinized forms have been used much more
frequently when it was considered that such forms would be used in normal conver-
sation (e.g. Boeotia rather than Boiotia). Since ancient Greek authors are almost
always referred to under the Anglicized or Latinized form of their name in conver-
sation and in non-technical literature and library-indexes, it seemed preferable to
use such forms to accord with normal usage and avoid any danger of confusion.
 When Greek tales from Roman sources are summarized in the text, the myth-
ical ﬁgures who appear in them will naturally be referred to under their proper
Greek names rather than their Latin names as in the Latin sources. It should be
remembered in this connection that the Romans liked to identify Greek gods with
equivalent deities from the Roman and Italian tradition, and would refer to Greek
gods under their Latin names when narrating myths from the Greek tradition. In
the works of Roman authors such as Ovid and Hyginus, the main Greek deities
will thus appear as follows:
Aphrodite as Venus
Ares as Mars
Artemis as Diana
Athena as Minerva
Demeter as Ceres
Dionysos often as Liber (if not as Dionysus or Bacchus)
Hephaistos as Volcanus (Anglicized to Vulcan)
Hermes as Mercurius (Anglicized to Mercury)
Hestia as Vesta
Kronos as Saturnus (Anglicized to Saturn)
Poseidon as Neptunus (Anglicized to Neptune)
Zeus as Iuppiter (Anglicized to Jupiter)

The name of Persephone was corrupted to Proserpina in Latin, that of Herakles to
Hercules, and that of Leto to Latona. Other names were translated, e.g. Eros to
Cupido or Amor, Pluto to Dis (see p. 108), Helios to Sol.
 I have made my own translations when citing passages from Greek litera-
ture; these are intended above all to be clear and literal, and do not pretend to offer
an adequate impression of the literary qualities of the original.
 When indicating the time of origin of Greek writings and legends, and so
on, it is often convenient or indeed necessary to refer to broad eras of Greek history
rather than to speciﬁc centuries or dates. The Archaic period can be regarded as
having extended from 800 or 750 BC to 480, i.e. from the end of the dark ages to
the time of the Persian Wars; the Classical period from 480 to the death of Alexander
the Great in 323 BC (or more loosely as extending over the ﬁfth and fourth centuries,
which was generally speaking the period of the greatest cultural achievements of
the Greeks); the Hellenistic period from the death of Alexander to the end of the
ﬁrst century BC; and the Roman period from the ﬁrst century AD onward (or more
precisely from 31 BC, when Augustus defeated the forces of Antony and Cleopatra
at the battle of Actium).
 The names of mythical characters are marked in capitals at the beginning 
of the main discussion of their mythology; bold type is used to indicate that a
succession of mythical characters belong to a common group under discussion, for
instance as children of the same parents (as on p. 519) or as participants in a joint
enterprise (as on p. 317).

SOURCES FOR 
GREEK MYTH

T
he myths of the ancient Greeks, like the myths of most other cultures, were
forever in a state of ﬂux, undergoing constant change as they were passed on
by word of mouth and retold in different ways by authors of successive ages. A
handbook such as this must aim in the ﬁrst place to provide a systematic account
of the canon of early Greek myth, as initially established in archaic and classical
poetic literature, especially early epic and tragedy, and then summarized and system-
atized in prose by the early mythographers. A good impression of the nature of the
resulting vulgate or standard tradition, as conceived by mythographers of the
Hellenistic or early Roman period, can be gained from the only general mytho-
logical handbook to survive from Greek antiquity, the Library of Apollodorus. The
main myths and legends were organized into a pseudo-historical pattern to provide
a remarkably coherent history of the universe and divine order and of the Greek
world in the heroic era (which was conventionally thought to have ended in the
period following the Trojan War); and this history was underpinned by rigorous
systems of divine and heroic genealogy, which were essential if consistent chron-
ologies were to be developed. The individual myths within this broad framework
could be recorded in a variety of forms; even within the earlier literature, between
the time, say, of Homer and that of Euripides, they could undergo a multitude of
variations, and later developments could also leave their mark. Although powerful
versions might tend to establish themselves in the general imagination at the expense
of others, as in the case, for instance, of Aeschylus’ account of the murder of
Agamemnon (see p. 509), it is almost always misleading to talk as if there could
be a standard version of a myth that was set in stone from some early time. Quite
apart from merely narrating myths and placing them in their proper context within
the wider body of divine or heroic myth, a handbook must therefore also attempt
to trace the history of the more important myths, examining how they evolved over
time and came to be narrated in differing ways by different authors in different
genres. Since people who have an interest in Greek myth will not necessarily have
any very extensive knowledge of ancient literature, and since some authors and writ-
ings that are important for myth are not widely familiar outside specialist circles,
it was thought that it might thus be helpful to preface this handbook with a brief
survey of the main literary sources for Greek myth. The relevant authors are listed

separately in alphabetical order rather than discussed together in their historical
setting to make it easier for readers to seek further information on authors or works
of literature that are mentioned in the main text.
Cross-references to other authors are marked by an asterisk preceding the name of the author.
For reasons indicated in the preface, ancient Greek authors are referred to under the
Anglicized form of their name (which is often of Latin origin) even though ﬁgures from
myth are referred to under the proper Greek form of their name. The authors who are named
in the list were Greek (or at least wrote in Greek) unless otherwise stated. The history of
Greece after the dark ages is conventionally divided into four main eras, the Archaic,
Classical, Hellenistic and Roman; please see the preface for the signiﬁcance of these terms.
ACUSILAUS of Argos (probably writing at the end of the sixth century BC), early
mythographer who wrote about the legendary history of his native Argolid (see 
p. 230) and other regions, providing prose accounts of many legends from the epic
tradition. Less is recorded about his writings than about those of his most important
successors, *Pherecydes and *Hellanicus.
AELIAN (Claudius Aelianus, c. AD 172–235), prose author whose Historical Miscel-
lany and anthology of animal stories contain some material of mythological interest.
Translations of both are available in the Loeb series.
AESCHYLUS (525–456 BC), the earliest of the three great Athenian tragic poets
whose works are not entirely lost. Of the eighty or ninety plays of Aeschylus, six
of undoubted authenticity have survived. The three plays of the Oresteia trilogy,
which portray a cycle of revenge within the Pelopid ruling family at Mycenae, are
works of extraordinary profundity and resonance that can be ranked with the
Homeric epics as the most imposing monuments of ancient literature. The ﬁrst play
in the trilogy, the Agamemnon, shows how the Mycenaean king of that name was
murdered by his wife Klytaimnestra (Clytemnestra) after he arrived back from the
Trojan War; and the next play, the Libation-bearers (Choephoroi), shows how
Agamemnon’s son Orestes, who was sent abroad before the murder and grew up in
exile, returned to Mycenae to avenge his father’s death by killing Klytaimnestra and
her lover Aigisthos. The ﬁnal play in the trilogy, the Eumenides, shows how Orestes
was then persecuted by the Erinyes (Furies), even though Apollo had sanctioned the
killings, until he was acquitted of matricide at Athens at a trial superintended by
Athena (see p. 511). The other surviving plays are stiffer and less immediately
engaging. The Seven against Thebes, the last play in a Theban trilogy, tells how seven
champions from Argos confronted seven Theban defenders at the seven gates of
Thebes during the ﬁrst of the two Theban Wars (see p. 321); and the Suppliants,
which was the last play in a trilogy devoted to the myth of the Danaids, tells how
the ﬁfty Danaids approached the Argives as suppliants after ﬂeeing from Egypt to
avoid marrying their cousins, the ﬁfty sons of Aigyptos. There is very little direct
action in either play; indeed, more than half of the latter is composed of choral
lyrics. The Persians is one of the rare tragedies that dealt with historical subjects,
in this case the defeat of Xerxes during the Persian Wars. As regards the Prometheus
— Sources for Greek Myth —

Bound, the seventh play attributed to Aeschylus, there is disagreement on whether
it is a genuine work of Aeschylus or was written at a slightly later period by another
author (or at least heavily revised from a play by Aeschylus). It is remarkable in
any case for its unusual portrayal of Zeus, who is presented as a newly established
tyrant who exercises his power by the naked use of force. He has Prometheus nailed
to a rock to punish him for having opposed his will by championing the interests
of mortals; but Prometheus came to be released in a later play in the trilogy, and
some sort of reconciliation must therefore have been achieved between Zeus and
himself (see pp. 95–6).
ALCAEUS of Mytilene (born in the second half of the seventh century BC), an early
lyric poet who was a contemporary and compatriot of Sappho.
ALCMAN (seventh century BC), early author of choral lyric who lived in Sparta.
ANTONINUS LIBERALIS (probably second century AD), mythographer, author of
a surviving anthology of transformation myths, the Collection of Metamorphoses, which
provides prose summaries of forty-nine stories of the kind. Most of the narratives
are based on lost poetic accounts by two Hellenistic authors, *Nicander, who
composed a poem in ﬁve books on mythical transformations, and a certain Boio or
Boios (probably a pseudonym), who wrote a long poem called the Ornithogonia that
contained rather artiﬁcial tales in which groups of people were turned into birds.
There is an English translation by F. Celoria (London, 1992) and a French transla-
tion in the Budé series.
APOLLODORUS is the name traditionally ascribed to the author of the Bibliotheke
or Library, the only comprehensive mythological handbook to have survived from
classical antiquity. Although once regarded as a work of Apollodorus of Athens, a
learned scholar of the second century BC who wrote about mythology and religion
among other subjects, it is in fact a relatively late compilation of unpretentious 
character, probably written in the ﬁrst or second century AD. The ﬁnal sections of
the book (dealing mainly with the Pelopids and the Trojan War) are preserved 
only in two prose epitomes discovered in the late nineteenth century; but the narra-
tive is so concise throughout that most readers are unlikely to notice any change.
The Library is in effect a mythical history of Greece, organized on a genealogical
basis in accordance with the pattern established in the Hesiodic Catalogue (see under
Hesiod) and followed by early prose mythographers such as *Pherecydes – the
authority most frequently cited – and *Hellanicus; and since it is largely based on
good early sources and very little has survived from the works of the early mytho-
graphers, it is extremely useful as a summary guide to the early vulgate tradition.
Even if it may seem rather elementary in parts, it provides the best surviving
accounts of many stories (hence the extensive use that has been made of it by
compilers of mythological dictionaries and handbooks), and the stories are all placed
in their proper context and accompanied by full genealogies. Translations are avail-
able in the Loeb series (in two volumes with useful references to other ancient
sources) and Oxford World Classics.

APOLLONIUS of Rhodes (third century BC), a learned Hellenistic poet, author of
the Argonautica, an epic in four books that recounts the story of Jason’s quest for
the golden ﬂeece and his travels with the Argonauts. Since nothing has survived of
early Argonautic epic, this is our main source for the legend along with the accom-
panying *scholia, which provide all manner of information on earlier versions of the
story and local legends associated with the voyage and other relevant matters. From
an artistic point of view, the poem is more impressive for its depiction of the
changing feelings of Medeia and the love that develops between her and Jason than
for its portrayals of heroic action. We also possess an incomplete Argonautica in Latin
by a poet of the ﬁrst century AD, Valerius Flaccus, and a curious late poem in Greek,
the Orphic Argonautica, which is largely dependent on Apollonius (although it also
borrows from other sources and offers a divergent account of the return journey of
the Argonauts). A French translation of the latter poem may be found in the Budé
series. The Fourth Pythian Ode of Pindar provides the fullest earlier account of the
story of the Argonauts.
ARATUS (c. 315–240 BC), Hellenistic didactic poet, author of an extremely popular
astronomical poem, the Phaenomena, which describes the constellations and their
risings and settings on the basis of information provided by the great astronomer
Eudoxus of Cnidus (active in the ﬁrst half of the fourth century BC). Although
Aratus lays no great emphasis on astral mythology, recounting or referring to such
myths on only twelve occasions, his poem did much to encourage popular interest
in the constellations and their myths. The standard collection of constellation myths
was compiled somewhat later by *Eratosthenes in a prose treatise. The scholia to
the Phaenomena have more to say about the matter, as do the Latin adaptations of
the poem by Germanicus Caesar (15 BC–AD 19) and Avienus (fourth century AD).
ARISTOPHANES (born mid-ﬁfth century BC), Athenian comic playwright, author
of eleven surviving plays. Although not based directly on traditional myths as is
usually the case with early tragedy, these are sometimes of value for what they reveal
about particular myths or popular attitudes to myth and religion. The Frogs, in
which Dionysos and his slave Xanthias make a visit to the land of the dead, may
be singled out for what it reveals about the mythology and popular lore of the
Underworld in the classical period.
ARISTOTLE (Aristoteles, 384–322 BC), philosopher with an encyclopaedic range
of interest. His writings occasionally touch on mythological matters, and a spurious
work in the Aristotelian corpus, On Marvellous Things Heard, records some curious
mythological traditions relating to foreign parts. The remains of the pseudo-
Aristotelian Peplos are of some interest for what they report about the fates of various
warriors who fought at Troy.
ATHENAEUS (writing in about AD 200), author of the Sophists’ Banquet (Deipno-
sophistai), an eccentric compilation in ﬁfteen books that records more than anyone
could possibly want to know about banquets and convivialities. Since Athenaeus
— Sources for Greek Myth —

draws on a wide range of sources and is never reluctant to provide a quotation, much
of value that would otherwise have been lost, some of it relating to myth, is preserved
among the dross. There is a translation with a full index in the Loeb series.
BACCHYLIDES (died mid-ﬁfth century BC), lyric poet, a nephew of Simonides and
contemporary of Pindar. Substantial remains of his epinician odes (choral 
odes written in honour of victors at the games) and six of his dithyrambs have been
recovered from papyri discovered in the nineteenth century. The former poems 
are constructed in a similar manner to those of *Pindar, with a mythical narrative
at their heart; and although Bacchylides lacks the dash and genius of his greater
contemporary, he has distinctive gifts of his own as a storyteller. A good impres-
sion of this may be gained from the ﬁfth of his epinician odes, which describes how
Herakles met and conversed with the shade of Meleagros when he descended to the
Underworld to fetch Kerberos, and was moved to tears by his account of his prema-
ture death. Another well-preserved ode describes how the daughters of Proitos, 
king of Tiryns, once offended Artemis and were stricken with madness until the
goddess was appeased. The dithyrambs also contain attractive mythical narratives,
describing for instance how Theseus proved to Minos that he was a son of Poseidon
(see pp. 345–6) or ﬁrst arrived in his ancestral homeland of Athens.
BION of Smyrna (late second century BC), a pastoral poet who is best known as the
probable author of the Lament for Adonis.
CALLIMACHUS (c. 305–240 BC), Hellenistic poet and scholar who compiled the
classiﬁed catalogue of the books in the library at Alexandria. His six Hymns, 
which are full of interesting mythological lore, have survived complete because some
editor in late antiquity included them in a collection of hymns along with the
Homeric Hymns and other poems of a comparable nature. Although modelled 
on the *Homeric Hymns, they are altogether different in character, as would be
expected, as highly sophisticated poems that are learnedly playful and often gently
ironic in tone. The third hymn, addressed to Artemis, is particularly charming. The
ﬁfth tells how Teiresias came to be struck blind after seeing Athena naked (see 
p. 330), while the sixth describes how the Thessalian hero Erysichthon was punished
with insatiable hunger after felling some trees in a grove of Demeter (see p. 133).
Even if these poems may seem rather dry on ﬁrst acquaintance, they can be very
beguiling when one comes to appreciate their author’s distinctive humour and tone
of voice. The rest of his poetry is preserved in fragments alone, many recovered from
papyri.
CICERO (106–43 BC), Roman politician, orator and prose writer, who sometimes
refers to Greek legends and mythical matters in his religious and philosophical
treatises.
COLLUTHUS (probably ﬁfth century AD), author of the Rape of Helen, a mercifully
short epic poem in 394 lines; translated in the Loeb series.

CONON (probably writing at the end of the ﬁrst century BC or beginning of the
next), mythographer, author a collection of ﬁfty legends of varied nature in which
foundation legends are especially prominent. It is preserved in an epitome prepared
by the Byzantine scholar Photius (and a French translation is thus available in the
Budé edition of Photius’ Library).
DIODORUS SICULUS (i.e. of Sicily, ﬁrst century BC), Greek Sicilian historian,
author of a universal history in fourteen books. In contrast to historians of a more
critical turn of mind, Diodorus did not exclude the period of legend from his survey,
and the earlier books are thus of considerable value to the mythologist. As is under-
standable in a work with historical pretensions, he tended to favour rationalistic
accounts from the Hellenistic period, but some of the material that he included as
a consequence is of great interest in its own right, notably a report on *Euhemerus
and extracts from two works of Dionysius Scytobrachion (‘the Leather-armed’, 
in reference to his proliﬁc output) that offered novelistic versions of the myths of
the Argonauts and the Amazons. The fourth book, however, which deals with the
mythical history of the heartland of Greece, seems to have been largely based 
on a mythological handbook and includes more conventional material from the
earlier vulgate. The biography of Herakles is worthy of special note since it provides
a valuable supplement to that in *Apollodorus’ handbook. There is an excellent
translation in Loeb series.
DIONYSIUS of Halicarnassus (ﬁrst century BC), Greek literary critic and historian.
He lived at Rome for over twenty years, where he compiled the Roman Antiquities
(Romaike¯ Archaiologike¯), a long and indeed tiresomely prolix history of Rome from
the earliest times up until the Punic Wars. The ﬁrst book, which deals with the
prehistory of the area and the origins and founding of the city, has much to say
about Greek legend in so far as it relates to Rome and Italy.
EPIC CYCLE, and early epic in general (apart from the works of *Homer and
*Hesiod). (i) The epic cycle was a collection of early epic poems that were ordered
into a cycle to provide a chronological account of major episodes from Greek myth.
Although there may well have been different collections that varied in their content,
the poems that are described as cyclic in the surviving records are an obscure 
poem called the Titanomachia, which dealt with the earliest history of the world and
the gods (presumably covering some of the same ground as the Theogony), and two
series of heroic epics, a shorter series dealing with the family of Oedipus and the
Theban Wars and a longer series dealing with the Trojan War and its origins and
aftermath. (ii) Although very little is known about the Titanomachia and the Theban
epics, we are better informed about the poems of the Trojan cycle, partly because
more fragments and testimonies have been preserved, and partly because we possess
short summaries of their contents that were compiled in the Roman period by a
certain *Proclus. The ﬁrst of the Trojan epics, the Cypria, explained the origins 
of the war and offered an account of its progress up until the period covered in 
the Iliad. The signiﬁcance of its title is wholly uncertain. The Aithiopis picks up
— Sources for Greek Myth —

the story again where the Iliad leaves off, describing how the Amazon Penthesileia
and the Ethiopian prince Memnon arrived to ﬁght as allies of the Trojans (see 
pp. 446ff). It also described the death of Achilles, who was shot by Apollo and Paris
as he was advancing toward the city after killing Memnon. The contents of the next
two epics, the Little Iliad (Ilias Mikra) and the Sack of Troy (Iliupersis), seem to have
overlapped to some extent. The former epic described the suicide of Aias (Ajax) and
the events that immediately preceded the fall of Troy, and apparently went on to
describe the sack itself, which was of course the subject of the latter poem. The
Returns (Nostoi) provided a supplement to the Odyssey by describing the return jour-
neys of the main Greek heroes other than Odysseus (see pp. 482ff), and the ﬁnal
epic in the series, a relatively late poem called the Telegonia, provided an eccentric
account of the later life of Odysseus after his wanderings (see pp. 500–1). Proclus’
summaries and fragments from the poems are translated in the Hesiod volume in
the Loeb series. (iii) Although we know the names of many other archaic epic poems
and epic poets, little or nothing is recorded about most of them. Various poets wrote 
epics about Herakles, for instance, including a Spartan called Cinaethon and a
Rhodian called Peisander and, at a relatively late period, Herodotus’ uncle Panyassis
of Halicarnassus. Similar poems were written about Theseus, and the adventures of
Jason and the Argonauts must also have been a popular subject; the *scholia to
Apollonius tell us a certain amount about how the latter story was recounted in an
early epic called the Naupactia. The legends of the Greek regions would also have
been recounted in early epic; a poem called the Phoronis offered an account of the
earliest history of the Argolid (see p. 227) and a Corinthian epic poet called Eumelus
offered a distinctive account of the earliest history of his own land (see pp. 431–2).
Since epic poems, oral and written, would have been the main literary medium for
mythical narrative in the archaic period, it is salutary to remember how very little
we know about these early epics. For a helpful guide to this area of Greek litera-
ture, with translations of relevant passages, see G.L. Huxley, Greek Epic Poetry; Eumelos
to Panyassis (London, 1966).
ERATOSTHENES (c. 285–194 BC), versatile Alexandrian scholar who compiled the
standard collection of constellation myths, the Catasterisms (Katasterismoi). The short
book of that title that has been transmitted to us under his name is an epitome
that was prepared by some later author; further information about the contents of
the original work can be found in the Astronomy of *Hyginus and the scholia to
*Aratus’ Phaenomena and to Germanicus’ Latin adaptation of that poem. A transla-
tion of the epitome and the relevant section of Hyginus’ Astronomy can be found in
Theony Condos, Star Myths of the Greeks and Romans (Grand Rapids, 1997).
EUHEMERUS of Messenia (writing in about 300 BC), author of the Sacred Scriptures,
a book that explained the origin of the gods in rationalistic terms by suggesting
that they had been great rulers and conquerors of the past who had come to be
accorded divine honours. Although the original work is lost, much is known about
it from what is recorded by *Diodorus (6.1, easily accessible in the Loeb translation)
and Lactantius.

EURIPIDES (c. 485–406 BC), Athenian tragic poet, a slightly younger contem-
porary of Sophocles. Since two collections of his plays have survived, one an
anthology put together in the Roman period and the other a section of an alpha-
betical edition of his complete works, we possess nineteen of his tragedies, far more
than for Aeschylus and Sophocles. Seven relate to the Trojan War and its aftermath.
The Iphigeneia at Aulis tells how that daughter of Agamemnon was brought to sacri-
ﬁce to enable the Greek ﬂeet to sail to Troy (see p. 447), while the Iphigeneia in
Tauris tells how she was recovered from the distant land of the Taurians by her
brother Orestes some years after the war (see pp. 512ff). The Rhesus (which may be
wrongly ascribed to Euripides) dramatizes a tale from the Iliad, telling how the
Thracian prince of that name was killed in his sleep by Odysseus and Diomedes
after he arrived at Troy to ﬁght as an ally of the Trojans. The Trojan Women (Troades)
and the Hecuba (Hekabe) are poignant tragedies that portray the fate of leading women
of Troy after the fall of the city. The Helen is a curious tragicomedy based on an
unconventional version of Helen’s legend in which a phantom of her accompanied
Paris to Troy while she herself remained in Egypt during the years of the war (see
p. 445). Hektor’s widow Andromache was said to have become the concubine of
Achilles’ son Neoptolemos in Epirus after the war; Euripides’ Andromache presents
her as falling victim to the jealousy of Neoptolemos’ childless wife Hermione, who
plots unsuccessfully to kill her along with her young son (see p. 515). Three other
tragedies of Euripides are devoted to Theban myth. The Bacchae, a very late work
and perhaps the ﬁnest of the surviving plays, shows how Pentheus, king of Thebes,
was visited with a gruesome punishment when he tried to outlaw the unbridled
rites of Dionysos (see p. 173). The Phoenician Women is a very long play (apparently
with a post-Euripidean ending) that deals with the quarrel between the sons of
Oedipus and the resulting Theban War, while the Suppliants tells how the mothers
of the Argive chieftains who were killed in the conﬂict sought the help of Theseus
after the Thebans forbade the burial of the Argive dead. The plots of two tragedies
that are devoted to stories from Athenian myth, the Hippolytus and the Ion, are
summarized below on pp. 358–9 and 407–8. Three other plays deal with Herakles
and his children. The Alkestis tells how Herakles saved Alkestis from death after
she volunteered to die in place of her husband Admetos, while the Madness of Herakles
tells how the hero rescued his family from a usurper at Thebes but then proceeded
to slaughter his children in a ﬁt of madness inspired by Hera. Soon after the death
of Herakles, Eurystheus, king of Mycenae, tried to save himself from any future
threat from the family by eliminating the hero’s children; in the Children of Herakles
(Herakleidai), Euripides shows how they appealed to the Athenians as suppliants and
defeated and killed Eurystheus with their help. In the Orestes, the Mycenaean prince
of that name narrowly escapes death after being brought to trial by the citizens of
Argos for killing his mother Klytaimnestra and her lover Aigisthos; and the Medea
(Medeia) shows how the Colchian heroine of that name exacted revenge on her
husband Jason after he told her that he was planning to abandon her to marry a
Corinthian princess (see p. 398). And ﬁnally, the Cyclops is the only complete satyr-
play to survive from antiquity; it offers a comical version of the Homeric story of
Odysseus and Polyphemos, in which Seilenos and his Satyrs are presented as having
been taken prisoner by the ogre just before the arrival of Odysseus.

EUSTATHIUS (twelfth century AD), Byzantine scholar and churchman, author of
long surviving commentaries on the Iliad and the Odyssey. These are of value in so
far as they preserve material from the ancient scholarly tradition that would other-
wise have been lost.
HELLANICUS of Lesbos (active in the second half of the ﬁfth century BC), mytho-
grapher and author of writings on ethnography and chronology. More is recorded
about his works than those of any other early mythographer apart from *Pherecydes.
He compiled useful histories of various legendary families such as the Deukalionids
and Atlantids, and left his mark on the subsequent tradition by reﬁning and synchro-
nizing the heroic genealogies. He was apparently an inelegant writer, however, whose
narratives were less appealing than those of Pherecydes. Through his Atthis, a local
history of Attica (which is mentioned by Thucydides, 1.97, though not with any
great enthusiasm), he helped to inaugurate the distinctive genre of Atthidography
(see p. 363).
HERODOTUS (ﬁfth century BC), author of a long historical work in nine books,
the Histories (Historiai, i.e. ‘Investigations’), which provides an account of the conﬂict
between Greece and Persia and its historical background. It is a very wide-ranging
study that sets out to explain the growth of Persian power in relation to the histo-
ries of other lands outside Greece and developments within the Greek world itself.
It is of great value as a source for legend and for matters relating to legend, all the
more so since the author is always willing to digress and can never resist a good
story.
HESIOD (c. 700 BC), Boeotian epic and didactic poet. (i) Two surviving poems,
the Theogony and the Works and Days, can be regarded as genuine works of Hesiod
(even if it is not universally agreed that they can be ascribed to the same poet). 
One further poem, the Shield, which was certainly not of his authorship, has been
transmitted to us under his name, and a number of other poems are ascribed to him
in ancient sources. Very little is known of most of these other poems, but one of
them, the Catalogue of Women, which was again of post-Hesiodic origin, was a mytho-
logical poem of considerable importance that can be partially reconstructed from
many surviving fragments and testimonies. (ii) The Theogony (Theogonia, i.e. birth
or generation of the gods) provides a comprehensive genealogical history of the
origins of the gods, explaining how the universe and the main gods and goddesses
came into being, and how the present divine order came to be established under
the third ruler of the universe, Zeus. Since this was not only a very ancient account 
of these matters but came to be accepted as the standard account, the poem is a
mythological document of the ﬁrst importance, and we will take it as our main
guide in Chapter 2 and much of Chapter 3. It also describes how Zeus quelled a
revolt by the fearsome monster Typhon. The end of the poem was altered when the
Catalogue of Women was appended to it, but although it is accepted that part of the
concluding section of the present text is post-Hesiodic, scholars have disagreed as
to where exactly the genuine work of Hesiod breaks off. The most distinguished
modern editor of the poem, M.L. West, has argued that the end comes at line 900,

while others would place it later at line 929 or 962. (iii) As a poem that is mostly
about farming and favourable and unfavourable days of the month, the Works and
Days is less relevant to our subject, except in the two sections of the poem that
narrate the story of the ﬁrst woman Pandora (42–105) and the myth of the ﬁve
races (106–201, see pp. 69–70). (iv) The only other complete poem to be preserved
under Hesiod’s name is the Shield (Aspis), a short work in 480 lines that describes 
how Herakles defeated the Thessalian villain Kyknos and his divine father Ares in
two successive ﬁghts (see p. 282). The poem is known as the Shield because more
than a third of it is devoted to a description of the images on Herakles’ shield, in
a passage that was evidently modelled on Homer’s description of the shield of
Achilles in the Iliad. It is prefaced with an ehoie (see below) from the Catalogue
relating to Alkmene and was presumably written after that poem in the sixth century
BC. A translation can be found in the Hesiod volume in the Loeb series; since the
author was too incompetent to be able to organize his material properly or bring
his subject to life, the poem cannot be said to be anything more than a historical
curiosity. (v) Most of the other poems that were ascribed to Hesiod are little more
than names to us. They include an astronomical poem known as the Astronomia and
a book of moral precepts known as the Maxims of Cheiron, and mythological poems
such as the Melampodia, which recounted the legends of Melampous and other 
seers (providing for instance an account of the contest in divination between Mopsos
and Kalchas, see p. 488), and the Aigimios, which is named after a Dorian associate
of Herakles but apparently recounted a variety of legends including that of Io. 
(v) The genealogical epic known as the Catalogue of Women – or simply the Catalogue
– is the only pseudo-Hesiodic poem (apart of course from the Shield) of which we
possess substantial remains. Well after the lifetime of Hesiod, probably in the early
sixth century BC, some unknown author decided to write a continuation to the
Theogony so as to provide a genealogical history of the main heroic families also. As
was noted above, the end of the Theogony was altered quite radically to prepare for
the transition to this new subject-matter, as can be appreciated from the present
state of the text. Since the origin of each of the main heroic lines was traced to a
mating between a god and a mortal woman, the new poem (or relevant portion of
the combined poem) came to be known as the Catalogue of Women; it was also called
the Ehoiai because the story of each of these women was introduced with the formu-
laic phrase e¯ hoie¯, ‘or like she who . . .’. From its semi-divine beginning, each heroic
line would have been followed down to the period of the Trojan War or thereabouts,
and the principal legends associated with the members of the line would have been
narrated, usually quite brieﬂy, as the successive heroes and heroines were introduced.
It was a work of the ﬁrst importance, comparable in its own way to the Theogony,
because it established the panhellenic system of heroic genealogy that was adopted
and reﬁned by the early prose mythographers (such as *Pherecydes and *Hellanicus)
and can still be recognized, though with many variations from the later tradition,
in the mythological handbook of *Apollodorus. In tracing the histories of such fami-
lies as the Inachids, Deukalionids and Atlantids in the second part of the present
handbook, we will be following the lines that were laid down by the Catalogue-
poet. Although no manuscripts of the poem have survived, a fair number of
quotations and testimonies can be found in the works of ancient authors, and many

additional fragments, some quite extensive, have been recovered from papyri. As a
consequence, a surprising amount has come to be known about the structure of the
poem, and parts of it can be reconstructed in some detail; for a full discussion, see
M.L. West, The Hesiodic Catalogue of Women (Oxford, 1985). Many of the individual
fragments are translated in the Hesiod volume in the Loeb series, but they lose
much of their meaning when taken out of context. There is an Italian parallel trans-
lation of the standard edition of Merkelbach and West (from Fragmenta Hesiodea,
Oxford, 1967) in the Hesiod volume in the French Pléiade series; it may be hoped
that someone will publish a similar translation in English one day.
HOMER (probably late eighth century BC). (i) The Iliad and the Odyssey, the national
epics of the Greeks, were traditionally ascribed to a poet called Homer (Homeros),
on whom we have no trustworthy information. There is disagreement on whether
the two poems can be ascribed to the same author (and indeed on whether each of
them was basically the work of a single author, although scholars have been less
inclined to attempt to trace different sections to different origins since greater under-
standing has been gained of the process of creation in oral poetry). There is good
reason to suppose that they were composed in Ionia on the west coast of Asia Minor.
They certainly contain some later interpolations, even if these cannot always be
recognized with any assurance. (ii) In contrast to the usual pattern in epic, in which
a succession of episodes would be described in simple chronological order and the
traditional history of the war or adventure or whatever provided the principle of
unity, the entire narrative of the Iliad is ordered around a single incident in the
tenth year of the Trojan War – the anger and withdrawal of Achilles – and the
time-span is comparatively restricted. The main action is concentrated in a period
of only four days and nights, and the span of the whole story does not extend beyond
ﬁfty-one days; but the poem is artfully constructed so as to make it seem that it
epitomizes the entire trajectory of the war. The articulating theme of the poem, 
as announced in the ﬁrst line, is the wrath of Achilles, the mightiest of the Greek
warriors, who withdraws from the ﬁghting in anger at being deprived of his captive
maiden Briseis by the Greek commander Agamemnon, giving the Trojans an oppor-
tunity to advance out of their city and place the Greek army under severe threat;
but after his closest friend Patroklos is killed, he returns to the battleﬁeld to seek
vengeance and drives the Trojans back, killing many of them including their greatest
warrior, Hektor. A full summary of the plot may be found on pp. 462ff. (iii) The
poem makes many allusions to the preceding history of the war and to its conclu-
sion and aftermath, and also refers to events from the earlier lives of the participants
and to stories from other cycles of legend and from divine mythology. The loqua-
cious Nestor likes to reminisce about his youthful adventures in the western
Peloponnese, and Phoinix recounts the story of the Aetolian hero Meleagros while
trying to persuade Achilles to return to the ﬁght (see p. 417); but full narratives
of stories that have no direct connection with the war are naturally infrequent. The
long muster-list in the second book (the so-called ‘catalogue of ships’, 2.493–759)
preserves a large amount of very ancient information about the geography of Greece
in the legendary era and the heroic families that were supposed to have ruled in it.
A useful summary of the mythical history of Troy is provided by Aineias in the

twentieth book (208–40). The poem also has much to say about the lives and char-
acters of the gods. It records two versions, for instance, of myth in which the young
Hephaistos was said to have been hurled down from Olympos (see p. 165). (iv) The
hero of the Odyssey, Odysseus, was a cunning and resourceful warrior who came from
the island of Ithaca off the west coast of Greece. The epic describes how he wandered
through distant seas for ten long years after being driven far off course while sailing
home from Troy, and exacted vengeance on his return against a crowd of local
noblemen who had been revelling in his palace during his absence, squandering his
property and courting his wife. See pp. 492ff for a summary of his adventures. The
epic falls into three main parts. The ﬁrst four books (the so-called Telemachia) tell
how Telemachos, the young son of Odysseus, visited Nestor at Pylos and Menelaos
at Sparta to seek news of his missing father; the next eight books (5–12) describe
the adventures of Odysseus in foreign seas, partly as narrated by Odysseus himself
at a banquet in his last port of call (9–12); and the last twelve books tell how he
arrived home in Ithaca, exacted vengeance against the suitors after due preparation,
and was reunited with his faithful wife Penelope. In books 3 and 4, the poem reveals
a fair amount about the events that immediately followed the sack of Troy, and
about how other heroes, including Agamemnon, fared during their return voyages
and after arriving home (see pp. 482ff).
HOMERIC HYMNS, a collection of thirty-three poems in epic metre addressed to
various greater and lesser deities. Although widely ascribed to Homer in ancient
times, they are in fact of varied authorship and were composed at widely differing
times, ranging from the seventh or eighth century BC to the ﬁfth century or even
later. While many are no more than brief preludes (prooimia) that would be chanted
by rhapsodes before epic recitations, a few are substantial narrative poems of consid-
erable charm that describe important episodes in the lives of the gods. The Hymn
to Demeter (no. 2) tells how the corn-goddess Demeter searched for her daughter
Persephone after she was abducted by Hades, and ﬁnally forced Zeus to take action
on her behalf by causing the earth to remain barren and so depriving the gods of
their sacriﬁces (see pp. 126ff). The poem explains the origin of the Eleusinian
Mysteries and alludes to various aspects of Eleusinian cult, and was presumably
composed in the area of Eleusis, perhaps in the late seventh century BC. The Hymn
to Apollo (3), which may well have been put together from two originally separate
poems, describes how Leto came to give birth to her divine twins Apollo and Artemis
on the island of Delos, and goes on to explain how Apollo came to establish his
oracle and shrine at Delphi (see pp. 144 and 188). The Hymn to Hermes (4), which
is broadly humorous in tone, describes how the infant Hermes set off to rustle the
cattle of Hermes on the day of his birth, but reached an accommodation with Apollo
soon afterwards and was assigned his main functions as a god (see pp. 161ff). The
longer of the two hymns addressed to Aphrodite, the ﬁfth, describes how the goddess
seduced Anchises, a member of the Trojan royal family, on Mount Ida in the Troad
and conceived Aineias to him (see pp. 200–1ff). The much shorter Hymn to Dionysos
(7) describes how some pirates tried to abduct the god in his youth, provoking him
to transform them into dolphins after ﬁrst working some miracles as a manifesta-
tion of his power (see p. 177). The short Hymn to Pan (19) is also of some interest
— Sources for Greek Myth —

for its description of the nature and birth of the goat-footed god. Translations are
available in the Hesiod volume in the Loeb series and elsewhere; they make delightful
reading even in a plain prose translation.
HYGINUS (Gaius Julius Hyginus), a learned freedman of Augustus who became
the librarian of the Palatine Library, the putative author of two works of mytho-
logical interest, the Fabulae (i.e. Mythical Tales, also known as the Genealogiae), 
a handbook of mythology, and the Astronomia, a popular treatise on astronomy. Both
books were compiled from Greek sources. Since their author was a scholar of limited
competence who could make elementary mistakes in translating from the Greek, it
is generally agreed that these cannot be genuine works of Hyginus, and they were
probably written after his time in the second century AD. The 220 chapters of the
Fabulae consist either of brief mythological narratives or of catalogues (e.g. of mothers
who killed their sons, persons who were suckled by animals, inventors and their
inventions). Although the sources of the narratives are rarely indicated, the book
seems to draw most heavily on tragic sources. The second book of the Astronomia
contains the fullest surviving collection of constellation myths, derived mainly from
*Eratosthenes. English translations of the Fabulae and this ‘poetic astronomy’ may
be found in Hyginus, The Myths, ed. and trans. M. Grant (Lawrence, Kansas, 1960),
and there are good French translations, with useful notes, in the Budé series.
LUCIAN (Loukianos, second century AD), orator and prose-writer of Syrian birth
who quite often touches on mythological matters in his copious works. In some of
his satirical dialogues, most notably the Dialogues of the Gods and Dialogues of the
Sea-gods, he makes fun of the traditional portrayal of the gods and traditional themes
from myth, while other works, such as the Charon and the Dialogues of the Dead, are
of interest in relation to traditional ideas about the afterlife and Underworld.
LYCOPHRON (born c. 320 BC), Hellenistic poet, author of a mythological puzzle-
poem, the Alexandra, in which the Trojan seer Kassandra delivers riddling prophecies
about the fall of Troy and the subsequent fates of those who took part in the war.
Although not exactly pleasurable reading, it is of great value as a source of mytho-
logical information if read in conjunction with the extensive ancient *scholia and
the Byzantine commentary of John Tzetzes. Particular attention is devoted to the
Italian West. Primarily on account of a seemingly anachronistic reference to Roman
power (1227ff), some scholars have argued that the poem must have been written
somewhat later by another author in the second century BC.
MIMNERMUS (second half of the sixth century BC), elegiac poet. The fragments
of one of his poems, the Nanno, contain interesting mythical allusions to Jason’s
quest and to Helios’ nightly journey to the place of his rising (see pp. 43–4).
MOSCHUS of Syracuse (second century BC), bucolic poet, author of an attractive
epyllion or miniature epic, the Europa, which tells how Zeus assumed the form of
a bull to abduct the heroine of that name from Phoenicia to Crete.

MUSAEUS (probably late ﬁfth century AD), author of an attractive miniature epic
that tells the tragic story of Hero and Leandros, two lovers who lived on opposite
banks of the Hellespont (see p. 577); a translation may be found in the Loeb series
(in the same volume as the fragments of Callimachus).
NICANDER of Colophon (second century BC), Hellenistic poet. Two of his didactic
poems, the Theriaka and Alexipharmaka (which dealt with poisonous animals and
antidotes to poisons respectively), have survived intact, but he was of greater import-
ance from a mythological point of view for his lost Heteroioumena (i.e. Metamorphoses),
a collection of transformation myths. *Ovid drew on the poem when writing his
Metamorphoses, and *Antoninus Liberalis provides summaries of some of the stories
recounted in it.
NONNUS (probably ﬁfth century AD), of Panopolis in Egypt, author of the
Dionysiaca, an interminable epic in forty-eight books that deals with Dionysos and
his expedition to India; translated in the Loeb series.
OVID (Publius Ovidius Naso, 70–19 BC), Roman poet who had an extensive know-
ledge of Greek myth and Alexandrian poetry. His most ambitious poem, the
Metamorphoses, is a collection of transformation legends in ﬁfteen books. The poem
begins with the origin of the universe and ends with the apotheosis of Romulus,
and the intervening stories are skilfully woven together with regular alterations in
tone to ensure that it forms a uniﬁed epic-style poem. Except in the last two books,
which are devoted to Roman and Italian matters, the stories are drawn almost exclu-
sively from Greek legend. Some were quite ancient while others originated in the
more recent literature, for transformations were a popular theme among Hellenistic
poets such as *Nicander. Most of the ﬁctional letters in Ovid’s Heroides are addressed
from heroines of Greek legend to their lovers or husbands, and the poet also refers
to Greek myths elsewhere in his poems.
PALAEPHATUS (probably fourth century BC), author of the Incredible Tales (Peri
Apisto¯n), a mythographical work that provides rationalistic (if highly implausible)
explanations for the origins of seemingly impossible tales from heroic legend, for
instance those that involve monsters. The author, who may have written under a
pseudonym, was apparently an associate of Aristotle who was active in the latter
part of the fourth century BC; if that is the case, the book provides the earliest
evidence for a number of important legends. A translation and commentary is avail-
able, by J. Stern (Wauconda, Illinois, 1996). A similar work of later origin has been
transmitted to us under the name of Heraclitus. In contrast to *Euhemerus and his
followers, such authors did not attempt to rationalize divine myths.
PARTHENIUS of Nicaea (ﬁrst century BC), late Hellenistic poet and mythogra-
pher, author of Sufferings in Love (Ero¯tika Pathe¯mata), a collection of prose summaries
of thirty-six love-stories, mostly obscure and of relatively late origin. In relation to
early myth, many are of interest for the way in which standard motifs from earlier
myth are recycled in them. Translations are available in the Loeb series and in J.L.

Lightfoot’s recent edition of the works of Parthenius (Oxford, 1999, with illumi-
nating discussions and commentary).
PAUSANIAS (second century AD), author of a Description of Greece in ten books,
covering the entire Peloponnese and much of Central Greece. Pausanias visited all
the main towns and other sites of interest in these areas to investigate their tradi-
tions and topography, monuments and antiquities, and cults and local mythology.
The resulting work is a source of the very highest value for the mythologist. 
It records local traditions about the ancient history of the cities and lands that he
passed through, and many legends that were attached to local monuments and land-
marks; and although it has to be remembered that he collected this local material
at a relatively late period, he also preserves a large amount of information that relates
unquestionably to the early mythical tradition, both in references to early literature
(for he was widely read and was willing to extend his reading to seek answers 
to speciﬁc questions) and in descriptions of early works of art such as the mural
paintings of Polygnotos (ﬁfth century BC) or the chest of Kypselos (sixth century).
For mythological purposes at least, the edition in the Loeb series is to be preferred
to the Penguin translation, which omits some heroic genealogies without any imme-
diate warning and translates some Greek names into English in a haphazard and
confusing manner.
PHERECYDES of Athens (probably active in the ﬁrst half of the ﬁfth century BC),
early mythographer, a proliﬁc writer who compiled comprehensive accounts of the
legendary history of Greece, drawing most of his material from early epic and organ-
izing it on a genealogical basis in accordance with the procedure developed in the
Hesiodic Catalogue (see under Hesiod). These works of Pherecydes, which were
known as the Historiai or Genealogiai, were published by the Alexandrian scholars
in an edition in ten books, and were very widely consulted by scholars and poets
as a standard source for narratives from early legend. As we know from a few
surviving passages, the stories were recounted with pleasing simplicity in a naïve
paratactic style. Although no manuscripts of Pherecydes’ writings have been trans-
mitted to us, we know a fair amount about their contents, largely because the
scholiasts refer to them with notable frequency. *Apollodorus cites Pherecydes 
by name thirteen times in his little manual, more than any other authority, and
uses him as his main source in some sections of the book (for instance in his account
of the life of Perseus).
PINDAR (c. 518–438 BC), author of choral lyric, perhaps the greatest lyric poet of
ancient Greece. In addition to numerous fragments, four complete books of his
poetry have survived, consisting of odes that he wrote in honour of victors at the
four main athletic festivals, the Olympian, Pythian, Nemean and Isthmian Games.
These epinician odes (i.e. ‘odes of victory’) are of greater value as sources of myth
than might be supposed, for the poet rarely devotes many lines to the victory or
victor but soon passes on to a mythical narrative after a short prelude, and devotes
much of the poem to the myth before returning to praise the victor and his prowess
or good fortune at the end. His victory is most effectively ennobled by being

presented against this mythical background. The myth could be introduced on a
variety of pretexts, typically in connection with the family history of the victor or
with the traditions of his homeland or the place of his victory. Although the narra-
tives may be quite long, they are rarely developed in a straightforward chronological
manner as in epic poetry, for the poet tends to concentrate on particular aspects of
the story that are relevant to his ‘argument’, and to start in the middle of the story
and range backwards and forwards in time. Pindar recounts or refers to a great many
myths in his poems, and provides the ﬁrst surviving mention or proper account of
many a story. Three full and relatively straightforward narratives may be singled 
out by way of example. In his Seventh Olympian Ode, Pindar explains how the Sun-
god Helios came to win the island of Rhodes as his special domain (see p. 43); in
his Ninth Pythian Ode, he tells how Apollo abducted the nymph Kyrene to North
Africa as his mistress after seeing her wrestling with a lion in her native Thessaly
(see p. 152); and in his Sixth Olympian Ode, he describes the birth, exposure and
rescue of the seer Iamos (see p. 548). The oldest detailed account of the very ancient
myth of the Argonauts may be found in the Fourth Pythian Ode.
PLATO (c. 429–347
BC), Athenian philosopher and author of philosophical
dialogues. Although his writings cannot be said to be of any great value as a source
for myth (except perhaps in relation to the mythology of the Underworld and after-
life), they are full of mythological allusions and contain distinctive philosophical
myths of Plato’s own invention.
PLINY the Elder (Gaius Plinius Secundus, AD 23/4–79), Roman writer, author of
a Natural History in thirty-seven books, an encyclopaedia of the natural world that
records a vast amount of miscellaneous information.
PLUTARCH (mid-ﬁrst century AD until after 120), author of biographies and of
essays and dialogues on moral, religious and other subjects. He quite often touches
on mythological matters in the latter works (which are known collectively as the
Moralia). The apocryphal myths in the pseudo-Plutarchean Greek and Roman Parallel
Stories and On Rivers should not be taken too seriously. A very useful life of Theseus
may be found among Plutarch’s biographies, but his life of Herakles is lost (which
would be more regrettable if we did not possess full accounts of that hero’s life by
Diodorus and Apollodorus).
PROCLUS, the author of some surviving summaries of the Trojan epics in the *epic
cycle. It is not known whether the Proclus in question was the Neoplatonic philoso-
pher of that name (ﬁfth century AD) or a grammarian of the second century AD.
QUINTUS of Smyrna (probably fourth century AD), author of a late epic poem in
fourteen books, the Posthomerica, which was written to provide a synoptic account
of the ﬁnal stages and conclusion of the Trojan War after the poems of the *epic
cycle had ceased to be read (or at least fallen from favour). It describes all that took
place after the period covered in the Iliad, ending with the sack of Troy and the
perilous return voyage of the conquering army. Although Quintus would have drawn
— Sources for Greek Myth —
16

much of his material from fairly late sources, he was deliberately conservative in his
choice of sources, taking care to avoid novelistic or revisionist accounts. A transla-
tion is available in the Loeb series; although there are some attractive passages, the
poem as a whole is long-winded and artiﬁcial and does not often come to life.
SAPPHO of Lesbos (born late seventh century BC), author of lyric poetry, mainly
of an intimate character.
SCHOLIA, ancient explanatory notes preserved in the margins of ancient writings.
Since myth so often provided the subject-matter for Greek poetry and drama, many
of these are inevitably devoted to mythological matters, narrating myths to account
for allusions in the text in question, explaining speciﬁc points that arise from narra-
tives in the text, citing parallels and variants from other sources (often from literature
that is lost to us), and so on. Most of what we know of early mythographers such
as *Pherecydes and *Hellanicus is derived from scholia. The scholia to the Homeric
epics and to Pindar, Euripides, Apollonius and Lycophron are particularly valuable
as sources of mythological information. Latin scholia can also be useful to the student
of Greek mythology, notably the scholia to the poems of Vergil and the Theban
epic of Statius.
SENECA (c. 40 BC–AD 65), Roman politician, philosopher and writer, author of
nine melodramatic tragedies that were based on stories from Greek legend and
modelled on plays of the Attic tragedians, especially Euripides, namely the Hercules
Furens, Hercules on Oeta, Medea, Phaedra, Oedipus, Thyestes, Agamemnon, Troades and
Phoenissae.
SERVIUS (fourth century AD), Roman scholar who is best remembered as the author
of a commentary on the poems of *Vergil. The longer version of his commentary
(known as Servius auctus or Servius Danielis) incorporates material from other authors.
These and other ancient notes on Vergil’s works contain valuable reports on Greek
legend, preserving some stories that are recorded in no other source.
SIMONIDES (c. 556–468 BC), lyric poet. Far less of his poetry survives than is the
case with his nephew Bacchylides and great successor Pindar, and little of what does
survive has anything to do with myth. This is a shame because he seems to have
had gifts of his own as a narrative poet who was capable of writing with great
simplicity and pathos. These qualities are shown to the full in a wonderful little
poem (543 PMG) in which Danae sings a sad lament to her sleeping baby Perseus
as they are drifting through rough seas in a little chest (see p. 239). We have to
rely in the main on scholiasts’ reports for an idea of how Simonides recounted 
other myths.
SOPHOCLES (c. 496–406 BC), Athenian tragic poet, a contemporary of Euripides.
The most widely familiar of his seven surviving plays are those that portray the 
sad fate of Oedipus and his daughter Antigone. In Oedipus the King (Oidipous
Tyrannos), Sophocles shows how it ﬁnally came to be revealed that Oedipus had

unknowingly killed his father and married his mother; and the Oedipus at Colonus,
a very late work, portrays the last hours of the blind and exiled king of Thebes,
describing how he died in mysterious circumstances at Colonus (Kolonos) in Attica
after arriving there with Antigone as his guide. Antigone herself is the heroine of
the Antigone, which tells how she provoked her own death by attending to the burial
of her brother Polyneikes in contravention of a decree of Kreon, king of Thebes.
Two of the other plays of Sophocles are set in the ﬁnal period of the Trojan War,
namely the Ajax (or Aias in Greek), which tells how the mighty warrior of that
name came to commit suicide after being defeated in a contest for the arms of the
dead Achilles (see p. 470), and the Philoktetes, which tells how the great archer of
that name was ﬁnally recovered from the island of Lemnos after being marooned
there by his comrades (see pp. 449–50). The Women of Trachis (Trachiniai) deals with
the events that led up to the death of Herakles, while the Elektra portrays the
predicament of Elektra, daughter of Agamemnon, at Mycenae after the murder of
her father. The action of the latter play is set at the time when Elektra’s brother 
Orestes returns to avenge the murder. Substantial remains of one of Sophocles’ satyr-
plays, the Trackers (Ichneutai), have been recovered from papyri; it tells how Seilenos
and his crew of cowardly Satyrs tracked down the infant Hermes after his theft of
Apollo’s cattle.
STATIUS (Publius Papinius Statius, c. 45–96 AD), Roman poet, author of the
Thebais, a Theban epic in twelve books that tells the story of the conﬂict between
the two sons of Oedipus. He also embarked on an epic account of the life of Achilles,
the Achilleis, of which only two books were completed.
STEPHANUS of Byzantium (c. sixth century AD), author of a large geographical
lexicon, the Ethnica, which contained information on mythological and historical
matters. Although we possess very little of the original text, its contents are partially
preserved in a surviving epitome.
STESICHORUS (ﬁrst half of the sixth century BC), Greek Sicilian lyric poet.
Although classed as an author of choral lyric, Stesichorus wrote long narrative poems
that seem to have had more in common with epic than with conventional lyric
poetry. Among the many mythical subjects that are known to have been treated by
him are the hunt for the Calydonian boar, Herakles’ theft of the cattle of Geryon
(probably providing the basis for Apollodorus’ account of that episode, see p. 264),
Eriphyle’s betrayal of her husband, the sack of Troy, and the revenge of Orestes;
but although his poems apparently exerted a considerable inﬂuence on the devel-
opment of the mythical tradition, almost nothing is preserved of them. Stesichorus
himself became a subject of legend, as we will see (p. 583), for he was said to have
written a poem of recantation to win back his eyesight after he had been blinded
by Helen for insulting her in one of his poems.
STRABO (c. 64 BC–AD 19), historian and geographer, author of a surviving
geographical treatise in seventeen books. The bulk of the work is a descriptive
regional geography of the known world, compiled chieﬂy from secondary sources.

Since Strabo is primarily interested in the world as a habitation for man and a setting
for human activities and history, he quite often has occasion to refer to mythological
matters in relation to the traditions and historical background of the areas that he
surveys. His respect for Homer’s authority encouraged him to include antiquarian
material. A translation with a good index can be found in the Loeb series.
THEOCRITUS (active in the ﬁrst half of the third century BC), a Hellenistic poet
who is best remembered as the founder of the ancient genre of bucolic or pastoral
poetry, although he was actually more versatile than this might suggest. His poems
(apart from the epigrams) are traditionally known as Idylls, but it should not be
inferred from this that all are idyllic in the modern sense since the term could
originally be applied to poems that contained a wide range of subject-matter; one
of the ﬁnest of Theocritus’ idylls is a thus a portrayal of city-life in which two chat-
tering women set off from home to attend a festival of Adonis, while others are
mythical narratives in miniature epic form. Idyll 13, the Hylas, tells how Herakles’
favourite of that name was snatched away by amorous spring-nymphs; Idyll 24, the
Herakliskos (Little Herakles), tells how the infant Herakles strangled two snakes that
were sent against him by Hera; Idyll 22, the Hymn to the Dioskouroi, tells how
Polydeukes confronted the brutal Amykos in a lethal boxing-match (see p. 386),
and then offers a rather unusual account of the conﬂict between the Dioskouroi and
the sons of Leukippos (see p. 529). From among the spurious poems in the
Theocritean corpus, Idyll 25, Herakles the Lion-killer, is worthy of mention, and others
too, genuine and spurious, are of mythological interest; Idyll 6, for instance, is a
pastoral poem in which two shepherds sing of the love of Polyphemos and Galateia.
We possess poems by two of Theocritus’ successors, *Moschus and *Bion, and there
is an anonymous poem of related type, the Megara, in which the wife and mother
of Herakles talk to one another of their sorrows. The poems of Theocritus are trans-
lated along with those of his successors in the volume in the Loeb series entitled
The Greek Bucolic Poets, and other translations can be found elsewhere.
THEOGNIS (sixth century BC), elegiac poet of aristocratic temper; almost 1,400
lines of verse, evidently of varied origin, are preserved under his name, but only a
handful are of mythological interest.
THUCYDIDES (died c. 400 BC), author of a history of the Peloponnesian War
which is the most impressive exercise in historical analysis to have been attempted
by any ancient author. The work starts with a short account of the earlier history
of Greece extending back into the period of legend (chapters 2–19 of the ﬁrst book,
known as the archaiologia).
TRYPHIODORUS (probably ﬁfth century AD), author of the Capture of Troy, a short
epic in 691 lines; translated in the Loeb series.
VALERIUS FLACCUS (writing in the latter part of the ﬁrst century BC), Roman
poet, author of an incomplete Argonautic epic, the Argonautica.

VATICAN MYTHOGRAPHERS, the name ascribed to the authors of three
medieval collections of mythical tales that are preserved in a manuscript in the
Vatican Library; the narratives are drawn from Latin scholia and late Latin sources.
French translations are available or in the course of preparation.
VERGIL (Publius Vergilius Maro, 70–19 BC), Roman poet, author of the Eclogues,
a book of pastoral poems, the Georgics, a poem about farming and bee-keeping, and
the Aeneid, an epic poem in twelve books that describes how the Trojan prince
Aeneas (Aineias in Greek) wandered to Italy after the fall of Troy and established
himself in Latium to become the ancestor of the founder of Rome (see pp. 588ff).
Vergil often refers to persons or stories from Greek legend, or borrows from Greek
legend or adapts it to suit his own purposes; and the surviving commentaries on
his works by *Servius and other scholars often refer to such matters as a conse-
quence, and can be a valuable source for the mythologist.
XENOPHON (c. 430–354 BC), historian and author of prose treatises, mainly on
practical subjects; he rarely has occasion to refer to matters of mythological concern.

THE BEGINNINGS 
OF THINGS

FIRST BEGINNINGS
A
lthough conﬂicting accounts were inevitably offered of the origins of the gods
and the physical universe, Hesiod’s Theogony, an epic history of the divine order
composed in about 700 BC (see p. 9), came to be accepted by the Greeks as the
standard mythical account of the earliest history of the world; and we will thus
adopt it as our main guide in the ﬁrst section of this book, while examining how
the world and the lesser and higher deities were supposed to have come into exist-
ence, and how Zeus and the Olympian gods attained supreme authority.
Before considering Hesiod’s cosmogony, it may be useful to picture how the world
was visualized by the Greeks in early times. They began with the notion that early
peoples generally seem to possess, namely that its real form corresponds to the form
that it appears to have when as much of it as can be viewed at once is observed
from their particular viewpoint. Now unless the observer is shut in between long
lines of hills like an Egyptian, or conﬁned to an island or archipelago like the in-
habitants of the South Paciﬁc, the world might appear to take the form of a circular
disc, more or less level except where mountains or hills rise up from it, and capped
by the immense roof or dome of the sky. On the one side the sun and stars can be
seen rising above the horizon, while on the other they disappear at their setting;
and as they always rise on the same side, in the east, they must presumably make
their way back again, either under the ground or by some other hidden route. This
and no other was the earliest Greek picture of the world, presupposed by the earliest
legends and surviving inconsistently into later ones. More speciﬁcally, the Greeks
supposed that the boundary of this disc of the earth was formed by the stream of
Ocean (Okeanos), which was not an ocean in the modern sense but a great river
ﬂowing around in a circle. The sky was envisioned as a substantial roof or dome,
sometimes said to be made of bronze or iron.1 It rose a considerable height above
the earth, but not an immeasurable distance. The residence of the gods was now
imagined as being the sky itself, now the summit of Mt Olympos on the north-
eastern borders of Greece. If one could pile three large mountains one above another,
as the gigantic Aloadai set out to do when they revolted against the gods (see 
p. 91), it would be sufﬁcient to form a ladder to heaven.2 The tale of Phaethon’s

ascent in the chariot of the Sun (see p. 45), to take but one instance, implies that
if one could travel far enough to the east, one would reach the place where the sky
touches the earth and the sun-god begins his ascent. Far to the west on the other
hand, where the sun goes down, there was a place of darkness, near which an entrance
to Hades could be found, as we will see in connection with Homer’s account of
Odysseus’ visit to the world of the dead (see p. 109). Hades was commonly pictured,
of course, as a murky realm that lay somewhere far beneath the earth, and might
thus be reached through one of the many deep rifts in the strata of the Greek rocks,
katavóthra as they are called in the native tongue, such as the famous one at Tainaron
in the southern Peloponnese. This is amply witnessed in the myths of Orpheus,
Herakles and other heroes who were said to have made incursions into Hades by
such routes whilst still alive.
It may be noted that Homer and Hesiod can speak of a place as lying beneath the earth and
at the edges of the earth as if there were no conﬂict between the two concepts. In stating, for
instance, that some monsters were conﬁned beneath the earth by their father Ouranos, Hesiod
says that he ‘made them live beneath the broad-path earth, where they suffered anguish, being
set to dwell underground in the furthermost distance, at the bounds of the great earth’; or in
a passage in the Iliad, Homer speaks in similar terms of the banished Titans.3
Of the actual geography of the world, a differing amount was known, as might
be expected, in different ages. In the Homeric epics, Greece proper and part of the
coast of Asia Minor are familiar ground for the most part, but beyond that, little
enough is known. The more distant adventures of Odysseus are located in a fairy-
tale realm, even if fabulous places on his itinerary came to be identiﬁed with real
places in the seas around Italy in the later tradition. To Aeschylus, some two
centuries later, southern Italy is familiar territory enough, but the interior of Asia
Minor begins to fade into the unknown and marvellous;4 and after the conquests of
Alexander, those who wanted a land of wonders had to go further again, to India
(see p. 579) or Northern Europe. Little was ever known about the regions of Africa
that lay to the south of the lands that fringed its Mediterranean shores.
Having this conception of the world in which they lived, the Greeks from quite
early times were interested in the question of its genesis; and it is natural that
Hesiod’s theogony, or account of the origins and successive generations of the gods,
should start with a cosmogony, to explain how the many-layered universe that forms
the seat of their rule came into being.
First of all, so Hesiod tells us, came CHAOS.5 This word, which seems literally
to mean ‘gaping void’, signiﬁes something more than mere empty space; for Chaos
is a primal feature of the universe, a murky reality which will be represented in the
forthcoming genealogies as the source of much that is dark and negative in the
world. It is worth noting that Hesiod imagines it as something that is solid enough
to be affected by the heat of Zeus’ thunderbolt.6 When the universe is fully
constructed, it will be situated between Earth and the lowest region of all, Tartaros.7
Although chaos is a neuter noun in Greek, Chaos is treated as female in so far as it
is personiﬁed as a deity. It should be remarked that the word Chaos carried no
connotations of disorder or confusion in early usage.
— The beginnings of things —
22

If Chaos comes ﬁrst, she is followed by three other entities, ﬁrst broad-bosomed
Gaia (Earth), the ever-sure seat of the gods, and then gloomy Tartaros in a recess
of the broad-pathed earth, and ﬁnally Eros, the personiﬁcation of love or, perhaps
more accurately, of desire.8 Although it is quite often assumed that all three are
born out of Chaos as her offspring, this is not stated by Hesiod nor indeed implied,
for the emergence of Chaos and her three successors is described in a single sentence
governed by the same verb geneto (‘came to be’). Gaia, Tartaros and Eros are best
regarded as being primal realities like Chaos that came into existence independently
of her. Chaos will form a distinctive family of her own, as we will see, through two
children of hers who are explicitly stated to have been born from her.9
Of these four primal entities, two alone will be of genealogical signiﬁcance, Chaos
and, above all, Gaia. EROS is introduced at this early stage because he is the motor
that will drive the process of mating and procreation that will bring everything else
into being. As a mythical agent, he could be pictured in a variety of ways, whether
as an ancient and all-powerful cosmic force as in the present context,10 or as a potent
force of nature who inspires all living beings with procreative desire, or as a mischie-
vous boy-god (or even child-god) who pricks gods and mortals with his arrows to
inﬂame them with desire. Broadly speaking, he grows younger and more frivolous
as time progresses; he will be considered further in his nature as a god of love when
we come to deal with Aphrodite (see p. 196). It is harder to say why Hesiod should
have included TARTAROS among these ﬁrst beings. He may perhaps have done so
because Tartaros is set so much apart from everything else in the world; for it will
be the nethermost region of the completed universe, lying far beneath the earth (or
in its very deepest recesses), at a lower level even than Hades. It is stated in a subse-
quent passage in the Theogony that Tartaros lies as far beneath the earth as heaven
rises above the earth, and that a bronze anvil cast down from the earth would fall
down for nine days and nights before reaching Tartaros on the tenth.11 Or according
to a comparable but somewhat different reckoning in the Iliad, Tartaros lies as far
beneath Hades as heaven rises above the earth.12 As originally conceived, Tartaros
served as a remote and secure prison for banished deities, and was wholly separate
from Hades, which was a home for dead mortals. In the course of time, however,
the distinction became increasingly blurred, and authors from Plato onward regu-
larly use Tartaros as a convenient name for the region of Hades in which the
undeserving dead suffer posthumous punishment (see p. 120).13 The personiﬁed
Tartaros was occasionally named as a father of sinister children, such as Typhon in
the Theogony, or of Echidna and Thanatos (Death) in later sources.14
The next stage in the development of the universe commenced when Chaos and
Gaia proceeded to generate further children from themselves without contact with
any male partner.
Chaos produced a son and daughter by such means, EREBOS and black NIGHT
(or NYX in Greek).15 Night is far more important than her brother because she
will found the main branch of the family of Chaos by generating a dismal brood of
children from herself (see pp. 25ff); for the most part, the children and grandchildren
of Night will not be mythical ﬁgures of any substance, but rather personiﬁcations
of dark, destructive and negative forces. Erebos is a ﬁtting brother for Night as a
personiﬁcation of darkness, especially of the darkness of the Underworld; his name

was used quite often from the time of Homer onwards as a poetic name for the
Underworld in its nature as a realm of gloom. He fathered two children by Night,
a daughter, DAY (or HEMERA in Greek), and a corresponding brother, AITHER,
who personiﬁes brightness as manifested in the bright upper air.16 Although it may
seem odd at ﬁrst sight that these radiant children should be born into this family
of darkness, it is really perfectly logical since Night and Day, and the dark and the
bright, are interrelated opposites that succeed one another. Brightness is bound to
enter the world, moreover, at a later stage than darkness because its emergence
marks a positive advance in the development of the universe. From the classical
period onward, Hemera was quite often identiﬁed with Eos (Dawn), the goddess
who brings the light of day.
If Chaos will become the progenitor of all manner of negative and harmful 
forces through her daughter Night, Gaia will be the progenitor of all that is posi-
tive and substantial in the world, including the features of the physical universe
that have yet to emerge, and the deities who preside over every department of nature,
and all the great gods and goddesses. Gaia’s family will be built up in a different
way from that of Chaos, for she will begin by generating two male partners from
herself and then mate with them to found two separate lines of largely different
character. As the ﬁrst and greatest of her self-generated children, she brings forth
‘starry OURANOS (Sky), equal to herself, to cover her over on every side’; and she
then generates two prominent features of her own topography that could be regarded
as being in some sense distinct from herself, the Mountains (Ourea) and the ‘barren
sea with its seething billows’ as personiﬁed in PONTOS or Sea.17 Gaia will take
Ouranos as her consort to found the main divine family from which the Olympian
gods and goddesses will spring; and she will found a smaller and more specialized
family through a liaison with Pontos, consisting mainly of sea-gods and nymphs
and beings of a monstrous or grotesque nature who needed to be set apart from
deities of the Olympian order.
To summarize, there were four primal realities, Chaos, Gaia, Tartaros and Eros,
which apparently entered existence independently of one another; and the two that
were of genealogical signiﬁcance, Chaos and Gaia, prepared for the foundation of
the three great families of Hesiod’s system by generating children from themselves,
Chaos a daughter who would found a family through parthenogenesis, and Gaia two
sons with whom she would mate to found two families by the normal processes of
generation. Since the family of Chaos’ daughter Night occupies a place apart in
Hesiod’s scheme, we will begin with that before passing on to survey the two fami-
lies that were founded by Gaia, the greater through her union with Ouranos, and
the lesser through her association with Pontos.
As was noted above, there were other mythical cosmogonies that followed a different pattern
from that of Hesiod. Night (Nyx) was elevated to a higher position in some, ﬁguring as the
ﬁrst being of all in one Orphic cosmogony, and as a member of the ﬁrst couple with Tartaros
or Aer in schemes ascribed to Mousaios and Epimenides respectively.18 The Iliad refers, by
contrast, to a tradition in which the ﬁrst couple were Okeanos and Tethys, two deities of
the waters (see further on pp. 36–7). Some of the most interesting and elaborate schemes
are those preserved in the Orphic literature (i.e. in apocryphal writings ascribed to the
— The beginnings of things —
24

legendary singer Orpheus from the late archaic period onwards). A characteristic feature of
these was the world-egg from which a demiurge or creator-god – who was given various
names such as Phanes, Protogonos or Eros – was supposed to have sprung. Aristophanes
refers to the world-egg in a gentle parody of an Orphic cosmogony in one of his comedies,
the Birds: Chaos, Night, Erebos and Tartaros existed ﬁrst of all when there was neither earth,
nor air, nor sky; and in the bosom of Erebos, black-winged Night brought forth a wind-
egg from which golden-winged Eros (the demiurge) emerged.19 According to one scheme
from the Orphic literature, Chronos, unageing Time, existed ﬁrst of all and gave birth to
Aither, Chaos and Erebos; and Chaos created an egg from Aither, from which Phanes or
Protogonos emerged, a bisexual being who then mated with himself to set the course of
creation in train.20 In the ensuing account of the successive generations of gods and their
conﬂicts, traditional matter from Hesiod was drawn in where appropriate.
The rationalistic cosmogonies that were developed by the early philosophers from the 
sixth century BC onwards marked a new departure (though not an absolute break, since they
would not have taken the form that they did if it had not been for the inﬂuence of early
myth and of mythical patterns of thought). Starting from an undifferentiated arche¯ or ﬁrst
principle, for instance water or air, such schemes set out to explain in purely rational terms
how the various elements (aither, air, ﬁre, water, earth) separated out and then how the fully
differentiated universe came to be formed from these elements.21 Features of the traditional
Hesiodic cosmogony were sometimes reinterpreted in the light of such speculations in the
later tradition. A good example of this can be found in the cosmogony at the beginning of
Ovid’s Metamorphoses, in which Chaos becomes a formless mixture of the elements or prin-
ciples of matter, hot and cold, soft and hard, heavy and light. After this initial disorder was
resolved, by some god or some process of nature, the different elements separated out and
came to predominate at different levels in the universe, ﬁery aither in the vault of heaven,
and air below it, and earth at the lowest level of all, embraced by the waters of the sea.22
According to other reinterpretations, Chaos was identiﬁed with the primordial water or ﬁre
(an idea supported by false etymologies that derived its name from cheisthai, to ﬂow, or kaio¯,
to burn), or was said to signify the empty space that must ﬁrst exist if things are to have
a place to exist in.23 Much later, we still ﬁnd traces of the classical cosmogony mingling
with accounts derived from the Hebrew creation-myth; thus in a paraphrase of Genesis,
falsely ascribed to St Cyprian and written in very indifferent Latin hexameters, the tradi-
tional chaos replaces the ‘deep’ of the original.24
THE FAMILY OF NIGHT
NIGHT (NYX) was a highly respected but rather vague ﬁgure in Greek myth.
According to a tale in the Iliad, even Zeus held her in awe, for when Hypnos (Sleep)
once sought refuge with her to escape the fury of Zeus (see p. 30), he let him 
go, angry though he was, ‘for he shrank from doing anything that would displease
swift-passing Night’.25 If Hesiod could call her deadly (oloe¯ )26 with her noxious
progeny in mind, she could also be regarded as kindly because she brings release
from the cares of the day,27 much like her son Hypnos. She could be pictured as
an umbrageous goddess who ﬂutters through the air on dark wings or perhaps rides
through it in a chariot. In myth, she is above all a cosmogonical deity, making no
appearance in mythical tales except in the above-mentioned story from the Iliad
(and also an unusual version of the myth of Zeus’ courtship of Thetis in which
Night rather than Themis, see p. 52, is said to have warned him not to marry

Thetis).28 She was credited with prophetic powers as the latter tale would indicate,
and had some connection with oracles; Pausanias mentions that there was an oracle
of Night at Megara.29
After bearing two children, Aither and Day, to her brother Erebos (see above),
Night produced many more children on her own without recourse to a male
partner.30 The majority of them have no connection with myth, cult or the visible
world, and could be described in modern terms as abstractions; but Hesiod and his
contemporaries would have viewed them from a different perspective, regarding
them as forces – here dark and negative forces – that exercise a real power in the
world (as in a sense they do). They could be regarded accordingly as divinities of a
kind, even if most of them are barely personiﬁed.
Since the worst of all negative forces is death, which annuls our very existence,
it is no surprise that Hesiod’s list of these children of Night should begin with
hateful Moros (Fate, especially with regard to the time of our death), black Ker
(Doom) and Thanatos (Death personiﬁed). Further down the list we ﬁnd two groups
of goddesses, the Moirai (Fates) and Keres (Dooms or death-spirits), who corre-
spond to Moros and Ker respectively and yet are appreciably different. Hypnos
(Sleep), who is named next after Thanatos and was traditionally regarded as the
brother of death, is a privative force of a different but related kind who robs us 
of all awareness and animation at night, at least in so far as we are not troubled 
by Oneiroi (Dreams), the illusory night-visions that disturb our sleep. Geras
(Old Age), who leads us toward death, occasionally appears with Herakles on vase-
paintings as a bent and emaciated old man; Herakles, who ﬁnally overcame age and
death to achieve immortality, keeps him at bay by threatening him with his club.
Various negative features of human existence are represented in Oizus (Pain), Apate
(Deceit), Nemesis (Retribution), and Eris (Strife). Eris will produce a series of chil-
dren of her own who personify all that arises from strife (see pp. 30–1). Nemesis,
the personiﬁcation of retribution and righteous indignation, was a more substantial
deity than many of her fellows, for she was honoured in cult at Rhamnous in Attica 
and at Smyrna and other Ionian cities, and appears in an ancient myth as a victim
of the ardour of Zeus and the mother of Helen of Troy (see p. 438). Philotes, 
whose name means friendship or love, is listed along with Apate (deceit) and
evidently represents pleasure of love or sex in the present context; she is included
among the children of Night because she is associated with the dark and all too
often with guile and deceit. The Hesperides (Daughters of Evening) are included
here, even though they are lovely nymphs who cause no harm to anyone, because
they live in the far west near the sunset and darkness (see below). And ﬁnally there
is Momos (Blame or Censure), the personiﬁcation of fault-ﬁnding, who appears in
fables and the like as a sort of licensed jester who carps at the works and deeds 
of the gods.
MOMOS makes only a single appearance in serious myth, in connection with the origins of
the Trojan War; when Earth once complained that she was overburdened by all the mortals
who were swarming over her surface, Zeus proposed to destroy much of the human race by
means of ﬂoods and thunderbolts, but Momos found fault with this plan and suggested that
it would be better to contrive the origin of a mighty war (see further on p. 437).31 His
— The beginnings of things —

other main story is a fable in which Zeus, Prometheus and Athena invited him to judge
their handiwork, a bull, a man, and a house respectively. He criticized the bull, saying that
its eyes should have been placed on its horns to enable it to see what it was attacking, and
criticized the man, saying that his mind should have been placed on the outside of his body
to make his bad qualities visible to all, and criticized the house also, saying that it should
have been mounted on wheels to enable people to move if they should acquire bad neigh-
bours; but this was all too much for Zeus, who was so infuriated by his carping that he
banished him from Olympos forever.32 Momos’ criticism of the bull is already mentioned
by Aristotle, though in a somewhat different form.33 According to another tale, Momos was
dismayed to ﬁnd that Aphrodite was so very beautiful that he could ﬁnd nothing at all to
criticize in her, and salved his honour as best he could by making fun of her sandals.34
A few of these children of Night are mythical ﬁgures of some signiﬁcance who merit
further consideration, especially the Moirai but also the Hesperides and Hypnos and
Thanatos.
The MOIRAI, who may be more familiar under their Latin name of the Fata or
FATES, are a group of goddesses who assign individual destinies to mortals at birth,
particularly with regard to the timing of their death. They are initially classed as
children of Night in the Theogony in accordance with their nature as appointers of
death, but are reclassiﬁed later in the poem as daughters of Zeus and Themis (Law
or Right Order) because they contribute to the proper ordering of the world under
the authority of Zeus (see p. 78).35 It would seem that they originated not as abstract
powers of destiny but as birth-spirits, much like the ones who in the modern 
folklore of the area visit new-born children and determine what their portion in life
shall be. The familiar myth in which the Moirai appear after the birth of Meleagros
to foretell what his lot shall be, and also to specify a condition for his death (see 
p. 414), was surely rooted in very ancient folklore. In their capacity as goddesses
who appoint the fate of mortals, they were objects of cult in many parts of the
Greek world, as inscriptions and monuments abundantly testify. They do not appear
at all frequently in myth however. Although one or all of them may be portrayed
as attending the births of gods or mortals, they have little occasion to make any
speciﬁc intervention in mythical tales unless they want to reveal some feature of a
person’s fate, as in the case of Meleagros, or else are required to take action when
a person’s fate needs to be altered in some way. One of the Moirai, Klotho, is thus
presented by Pindar as superintending the revival of Pelops when he is brought to
life again after being killed by his father36 (see p. 503 for the circumstances); and
in a tale from Aeschylus, Apollo is said to have made the sisters drunk in order to
persuade them to allow a substitute to die in place of Admetos (see p. 151).37
Apollodorus reports that they helped Zeus to quell two major revolts by tricking
Typhon into eating some fruits that would gravely weaken him (see p. 85) and by
clubbing two of the Giants to death with bronze cudgels.38
The Moirai are regularly represented as spinners from the earliest times. Although
Homer makes only a single reference to the Moirai in the plural (in remarking that
they have given an enduring heart to man), he speaks of the thread that is spun by
Moira for Hektor at the time of his birth; and the klo¯thes (spinners) who are
mentioned in the Odyssey as spinning people’s fates at the time of their birth may

surely be identiﬁed with the Moirai.39 Hesiod and later authors report that there
are three Moirai named Klotho (the Spinner), Lachesis (the Apportioner) and Atropos
(the Inﬂexible);40 in their rare appearances in art, they are shown as handsome
women, in literature they may be imagined as very old. The thread that they spin
is (or carries on it) the destiny of each individual in turn, and when it is broken, a
life comes to an end.
Later poetical imagination elaborated this imagery in various ways, making the Fates spin
a gold thread, for example, when spinning the fate of a particularly fortunate individual, or
take up an abandoned task when someone is recalled to life.41 Their Hesiodic names might
already suggest a division of labour, with Klotho spinning the thread, Lachesis determining
its allotted length, and Atropos cutting it off pitilessly at the time of a person’s death. Or
else Klotho may hold the distaff while Lachesis spins off the thread and Atropos cuts it
short.42 Or the inexorable Atropos may have the past as her province (for it is now unchange-
able), while Lachesis is concerned with the future, and Klotho presides over the present,
spinning each person’s particular destiny.43 Plato brings the Moirai into his great eschato-
logical myth in the Republic, dividing their functions in a manner that is too complicated
to be summarized here.44 One or all of them may be represented in art as reading or writing
the book of fate, hence presumably the quaint statement in Hyginus that they invented
some letters of the Greek alphabet.45 As might be expected, they are often associated on the
one hand with Eileithuia, the goddess of childbirth, and on the other with Ananke
(Necessity), Tyche (Fortune) and other personiﬁcations who have some connection with fate
or destiny.
The word moira means ‘portion’ or ‘allotment’, and could be used accordingly as a term
for a portion of land, or a person’s portion at a meal, or the share that is allotted to a person
when spoils are being divided. By a natural extension, the word could be applied to describe
the lot or fate that is apportioned to a person in life; and the awesome power that appor-
tions our fates could thence be personiﬁed as Moira, Fate or Necessity, or as a trio of Moirai
or ‘Apportioners’. In Latin, the plural Fata seems to be little more than an adaptation of
the singular fatum, ‘that which is spoken’, ‘the decree of the gods’, to the plural number of 
the Greek goddesses, although it does occur once or twice without a mythological reference,
meaning ‘the decrees’, much as we might say indifferently ‘the commandments’ or ‘the
commandments of God’. Later the neuter plural Fata gave rise to a feminine singular, quite
foreign to classical Latin, which still exists in the Italian and French words for ‘fairy’ (fata,
fée). A surer instinct led the Romans to identify their own spirits of birth, the Parcae (Paricae,
from parere, to bring forth) with the Moirai, although the identiﬁcation may have been
encouraged by a false etymology in which Parca was derived from pars, a word equivalent
to the Greek meros or moira.
The HESPERIDES were a group of nymphs who lived in the garden of the gods
at the westernmost edges of the earth, where they guarded a wondrous tree (or trees)
that bore golden apples. They were aided in their task by a formidable snake, a
child of Phorkys and Keto sometimes named as Ladon (see p. 64), who coiled 
himself around the tree or trees.46 Or in a less favoured account, the snake was
stationed there to prevent the Hesperides themselves from pilfering the golden
apples. In connection with this latter account, Pherecydes states that Gaia had
presented the trees as a wedding-gift to Hera, who had been so impressed by their
beauty that she had ordered that they should be planted in the garden of the gods.47
— The beginnings of things —
28

The Hesperides, who were famous for their beautiful voices, seem to have entertained
themselves by singing and dancing in the usual manner of nymphs. Their duties
were none too strenuous in any case, for the garden of the gods lay so far away that
it attracted no thieves at all until Herakles was sent to steal some of the golden
apples as one of his labours (see p. 269). In connection with that legend, as we will
see, the Hesperides were sometimes relocated to the far north. There were usually
thought to have been three of them, even if their number can vary from two to
seven; and they are commonly named as Hespere (or Heperie, or Hesperathousa)
and Erytheia (or Erytheis) and Aigle,48 in reference to the evening, the red of the
evening sky and the brightness of the day respectively.
HYPNOS (Sleep) and his brother THANATOS (Death) were always closely asso-
ciated in the Greek mind, whether as personiﬁed agents or simply as concepts. They
reappear in a subsequent passage in the Theogony, which states that they had neigh-
bouring homes in a dark and gloomy place at the ends of the earth near the home
of their mother Night.49 Even if their actions have obvious similarities, the two
brothers are of opposite character, for Hypnos ‘roams peacefully over the earth and
is kindly to mortals’ while Thanatos ‘has a heart of iron, a heart within his breast

of pitiless bronze, and keeps a ﬁrm grip on any mortal once he catches hold of him;
and he is hateful even to the immortal gods’.50 In the Iliad, which describes the
pair as twins without saying anything about their parentage, they raise the corpse
of Sarpedon from the battleﬁeld at Troy at the order of his father Zeus to carry it
home to Lycia.51 This episode inspired some memorable vase-paintings, which typi-
cally show the brothers as winged and dressed in full armour. Elsewhere in the Iliad,
Hera visits Hypnos on Lemnos to ask him to lull her husband to sleep after she has
made love with him, to distract him while some orders of his are being disobeyed;
but the godling is initially reluctant, saying that Zeus had been furiously angry
when he had performed this service for her on a previous occasion, and would have
hurled him out of heaven into the sea if he had not taken refuge with Night. Hera
wins him round, however, by promising to give him Pasithea, one of the Charites
(Graces), as a bride.52 Hypnos acquired no further myths in the subsequent tradi-
tion apart from one that linked him to Endymion, an Eleian hero who was famed
for his eternal sleep (see p. 411); according to this tale, Hypnos fell in love with
Endymion and caused him to sleep with his eyes open so as to be able to enjoy the
sight of their beauty.53 Some late authors, notably Ovid and Statius, diverted them-
selves by painting poetic pictures of his realm; Ovid presents him as sleeping on
an ebony couch in a dark cave in the land of the Cimmerians, with his thousand
sons, the Dreams, lying around him; the stream of Lethe (Oblivion) glides softly
over pebbles into the cave inducing slumber, while poppies and countless soporiﬁc
herbs bloom outside.54
As for Thanatos, there could be little role for him in serious myth because Hermes
was thought to conduct the dead to the Underworld and Hades presided over them
after their arrival. In the two memorable myths in which he does arrive to haul
mortals away to the lower world only to meet with humiliation, he is very much
a ﬁgure from folklore. When he arrived at Corinth to fetch Sisyphos, the cunning
hero deferred his death by tying him up (see further on p. 431);55 and in Euripides’
version of the story of Alkestis, Herakles lay in wait for Thanatos when he was due
to fetch her from her tomb, and wrestled her away from him to return her to her
husband (see p. 152).56
We must conclude our survey of the family of Night by returning to ERIS (Strife),
who was the only child of Night to produce a series of children of her own. She
has only a single proper myth, though one of some importance, which tells how
she stirred up the quarrel between Hera, Athena and Aphrodite that was settled
through the judgement of Paris, and so helped to set in course the train of events
that led to the outbreak of the Trojan War (see further on p. 437).57 As in the case
of the interrelated story of Momos mentioned above, and also the story of Zeus’
pursuit of Nemesis (which resulted in the conception of Helen), this myth can be
traced back to the Cypria, the ﬁrst epic in the Trojan cycle; it would seem that the
author of this poem liked to assign a more solid role to personiﬁcations of this kind
than was usual in high literature. Homer refers to Eris in the Iliad along with other
minor deities and personiﬁcations who stir up frenzy on the battleﬁeld; at the begin-
ning of the eleventh book, Zeus sends him down to inspire the Greeks with ardour
for battle, which he achieves by standing in the middle of their camp and uttering
a terrible piercing cry.58
— The beginnings of things —
30

The children of Eris represent the many harmful and destructive things that arise
from discord and strife, namely Toil (Ponos), Oblivion (Lethe), Famine, Sorrows,
Fights, Battles, Murders, Manslayings, Quarrels, Lies, Disputes, Lawlessness, Delu-
sion (Ate) and Oath (Horkos).59 This is allegory of the most obvious kind for the
most part; the last two alone require further comment.
ATE represents the delusion or clouding of the mind that leads people to commit
acts of ill-considered folly. There is a striking portrayal of her mode of action in
the nineteenth book of the Iliad, in which Agamemnon tries to excuse himself for
having robbed Achilles of his prize of war Briseis (see p. 463) by claiming that he
had been deluded by Ate who blinds all men, an accursed being ‘who has delicate
feet, for it is not on the ground that she walks, no, she tramples over the heads of
men, bringing harm to mankind and ensnaring one or another’.60 Agamemnon 
goes on to say that even Zeus himself had once been deluded by Ate, when Hera
had tricked him into swearing an oath that would enable her to ensure that the
inheritance that he had intended for his son Herakles would go to another (see 
p. 248). Zeus was so angry to discover how he had been deluded that he had seized
Ate by her hair and had hurled her down to the earth, where she now works her
mischief on mortals.61 According to Apollodorus, she fell to earth on the hill of 
Ate in the Troad, on the spot where Ilos would later found the city of Troy 
(see p. 523).62
HORKOS (Oath) is introduced into the list in connection with perjuries; he
personiﬁes the curse that will be activated if a person swears a false oath. Hesiod
expresses the matter in allegorical terms in the Works and Days, by stating that the
Erinyes (Furies) assisted at the birth of Horkos when Eris brought him to birth to
bring trouble to those who perjure themselves.63
GAIA, OURANOS AND THE TITANS
We must now pass on to the two great families that were founded by GAIA (Earth)
through her unions with her two self-generated partners, ﬁrst Ouranos (Sky) and
then Pontos (Sea). As has already been noted, the family that she founded with
Ouranos was the nobler of the two, bringing into being all the greatest gods and
goddesses, while the family that she founded with Pontos consisted mainly of sea-
beings and monsters. Of her two partners, moreover, only Ouranos can be regarded
as having been a true husband of hers, for she is linked to Pontos (who has no myths
and is barely personiﬁed) for genealogical purposes alone. Ouranos and Gaia are in
fact the primordial couple in Hesiod’s account of the earliest history of the world,
even if they are not the ﬁrst beings of all or the progenitors of all subsequent beings;
and the ﬁrst proper myth in that history is the one that tells how Ouranos provoked
the dissolution of his marriage and his own downfall by his mistreatment of his
wife and children. Important though he may have been at this early stage, Ouranos
makes no further appearance in myth after the end of his union with Gaia (except
in so far as he is said to have delivered prophecies to children of his). There is no
evidence that he was ever worshipped or played any part in Greek cult; at most, he
might be invoked along with other deities in oaths.

Ouranos was sometimes called Akmonides, i.e. son of Akmon, probably in accordance with
a very early usage. The Byzantine scholar Eustathius (who claims that Alcman, a poet of the
late seventh century BC, already referred to Ouranos as son of Akmon) records an ancient
etymological speculation on the matter, saying that the father of Ouranos was called Akmon
because the movement of the heavens is ‘unwearying’ (akamatos).64 It has been suggested in
more recent times that the name may be connected with Old Persian and Sanskrit acman, 
in which case it would mean stone, in reference to the solid vault of heaven. Whatever the
true meaning of the word, it may well have originated as a cultic title or epithet of Ouranos;
in like manner, Hyperion is sometimes a title of the sun-god Helios, and sometimes the
father of Helios. But the matter remains a mystery.
In contrast to her male partners, the earth-goddess GAIA or GE was honoured in
cult in classical times, though not as a deity of any great signiﬁcance. Shrines 
are recorded for her in various parts of Greece, including one on the south slope 
of the Athenian acropolis, where she was honoured as Ge Kourotrophos (rearer of 
children), and a joint temple with Zeus Agoraios in Sparta.65 She had no festivals,
however, and seems to have been honoured most frequently in conjunction with other
deities. The Greeks liked to invoke her in oaths for much the same reason that they
would invoke the sun-god Helios (see p. 43), because no one could break an oath in
any part of the world without her being aware of it; in a scene in the Iliad, two lambs
are fetched for sacriﬁce when a solemn oath is due to be sworn, a black female 
lamb for Gaia and a white male for Helios.66 From as far back as our evidence extends,
Gaia always represents the earth as a whole (even if she may once have been conceived
more narrowly, rather like Tellus at Rome, as the power residing in the patches of
earth with which her worshippers were immediately concerned and acquainted). 
It hardly needs repeating that the earth was not pictured as a globe in the earliest
times, but as a plane or disk of indeﬁnite expanse; but the true shape of the earth was
discovered quite early, certainly by the late ﬁfth century BC. Although Gaia acts 
as a personal being in her myths, and is sometimes shown rising up from the ground
in human form in works of art (as when she delivers the earth-born Erichthonios to
Athena, see p. 185), it cannot be said that she was really imagined as a fully anthro-
pomorphic deity, for she remained too closely identiﬁed with the earth as a physical
body. In a Homeric Hymn that is addressed to her, she is praised accordingly as the
mother of all (pamme¯te¯r) and oldest being of all who nourishes all living creatures and
brings prosperity to the human race through her harvests.67
Gaia bore three sets of children to Ouranos, ﬁrst a group of primordial gods 
who were known as the Titans (properly Titanes in Greek), and then two sets of
monsters, the one-eyed Kyklopes and the hundred-armed giants who came to be
known as the Hekatoncheires or Hundred-Handers. Ouranos hated them all,
however, and prevented them from emerging into the light, causing such anguish
to Gaia that she ﬁnally urged them to take action against him. The youngest of the
Titans, Kronos, who was the only one who had the courage to do so, laid an ambush
for his father, armed with a sickle that his mother had prepared for the purpose;
and he cut off the genitals of Ouranos as he approached his wife to make love, so
bringing their union to a violent end and making it possible for Gaia to bring their
children to the light at last. Kronos hurled the severed genitals into the sea, where
sea-foam gathered around them to generate the goddess Aphrodite (see p. 194); and
— The beginnings of things —
32

some blood dripped from them on to Gaia, causing her to conceive three further
sets of children, the Erinyes, Giants and Meliai (see p. 38).68
This story of the mutilation of Ouranos and his separation from Gaia has obvious
cosmological implications; since the sky now rises high above the earth, it is
suggested in the myths of many cultures that Earth and Sky, as the ﬁrst couple or
at least a primordial couple, must somehow have been drawn apart at a very early
stage in the history of the world. This is often achieved in a gentler fashion than
in the present story. In an ancient Egyptian myth, for instance, Shu, the personiﬁ-
cation of the air, is said to have interposed himself between the earth-god Geb and
the sky-goddess Nut to raise the latter’s body high over that of her partner. Or in
Maori myth from far away in New Zealand, the union between the ﬁrst couple 
Rangi and Papa, the female Earth and male Sky, became the ﬁrst source of life, but
all that they brought forth remained imprisoned between them initially because
they never relaxed from their embrace; so the ﬁrst gods, who formed part of their
offspring, consulted together and resolved that Tane, the god of forests and birds,
should separate Rangi and Papa by using his body to hold them apart; and when
he did so light appeared in the world for the ﬁrst time.69 Closer to home in the
ancient Near East, the Hurro-Hittite myth of Ullikummi referred to the sundering
of the earth and sky; and the upward ﬂight of Anu in the Hurro-Hittite succession
myth summarized below (see p. 34) implies the same. Hesiod makes no reference,
however, to the raising up of the sky, and he may not even have been aware of this
aspect of the story; he is concerned above all with the dynastic implications of the
intrafamilial conﬂict.
By mutilating Ouranos and so bringing his union with Gaia to an end, Kronos
displaced him as the main god, establishing himself as the new lord of the universe
with his fellow Titans as his subordinates. This was not the ﬁnal order of things,
however, since Kronos maltreated his children like his father before him, and was
destined to be overthrown by them in his turn. Having been warned by Gaia 
and Ouranos that he would be displaced by his own son, Kronos tried to remove
the danger by swallowing each of his children at birth; but his plan was foiled
because his wife Rhea hid his youngest son and gave him a stone to swallow instead;
and Zeus duly caused the downfall of Kronos when he came of age, by compelling
him to disgorge his other children and then banding together with them to banish
him and his fellow Titans to Tartaros.70 The initial story of the mutilation and
displacement of Ouranos thus forms part of an overarching ‘succession myth’ 
which tells how the present divine order came to be established under Zeus in the
third generation, after the fall of his father and grandfather. The Olympian gods,
who replaced the Titans as the principal gods, were either brothers and sisters 
of Zeus or else children of his (with two possible exceptions, see p. 80). This 
succession myth will be examined in detail in the next chapter, when we come to
deal with the rise of Zeus and origin of the Olympian order. Since the Kyklopes
and Hekatoncheires, the monstrous children of Ouranos and Gaia, are mainly of
interest for the part that they play in the succession myth, consideration of them
will also be deferred until then (as will full treatment of the mythology of Kronos
and Rhea). We will concentrate for the present on the TITANS, in their common

nature as a collective body of former gods, and in their individual nature as the
founders of the various lines that make up the family of Ouranos and Gaia in Hesiod’s
genealogical scheme.
Of all the Titans, only Kronos and Rhea are accorded distinctive roles of their
own in the succession myth, while the others act solely as a collective body. In the
Theogony (though not in all accounts, see p. 68) the latter make no contribution at
all to the ousting of Ouranos, which is effected by Kronos alone; but they beneﬁt
from it to become the chief gods of the pre-Olympian order under the rule of 
Kronos. They subsequently take common action in the Titanomachy, the great war
in which they attempt to quell the insurrection mounted by Zeus and his allies,
but are defeated and banished from the upper world forever. So is it possible to say
anything meaningful about their common nature, beyond the fact that they are the
banished ruling gods of an earlier generation? This was once a question that gave
rise to a considerable amount of speculation. A much-favoured theory suggested 
that the Titans were old prehellenic gods who had been displaced by the Olympian
gods of the Greek invaders. If that were so, the myth of the great war between the
Olympians and the Titans could be explained in historical terms, as reﬂecting 
the struggle of belief that the suppression of the older religion had entailed. It was
often proposed, furthermore, that the old gods must have been nature-powers of a
less advanced or less moral nature than the Olympian gods. Another theory appealed
to late evidence of doubtful value to suggest that the Titans were phallic deities.
The whole nature of the discussion altered, however, when it came to be realized
that the Greek succession myth bears a marked resemblance to myths of a compar-
able nature from the ancient Near East. Although other eastern succession myths
had been known at an earlier period, the crucial factor in this regard was the
publication in 1946 of a Hurro-Hittite myth that provides a particularly close
parallel to Hesiod’s myth.71
The Hurrians, an ancient people who lived in northern Syria and adjoining areas,
were subjugated in the fourteenth century BC by the Hittites, who were much inﬂu-
enced by their culture and have transmitted some of their myths to us on cuneiform
tablets. One such myth tells of the sequence of events that led to the accession of
the Hurrian equivalent of Zeus. Anu (Sky), who corresponds to the Greek Ouranos,
seized power by deposing an obscure predecessor, Alalu, and reigned for nine years
until his cupbearer, Kumarbi, engaged him in battle and defeated him. As Anu was
trying to escape into the heavens, Kumarbi dragged him down by his feet, and 
bit off his genitals and swallowed them. As he was then rejoicing in his triumph,
Anu warned him to think again, saying that his action had caused him to become
impregnated with three terrible gods. Although Kumarbi immediately spat out the
contents of his mouth, the Storm-god was already inside him, and eventually
emerged from his body. The text is very defective from this point onwards, but it
is clear enough that the Storm-god, who was the main god of the Hurrians and
Hittites just as Zeus was the main god of the Greeks, ﬁnally displaced Kumarbi 
as ruler.72 Hesiod’s myth may also be compared with a very ancient Babylonian
myth in the poem known as the Enuma Elish, and also with a Phoenician myth 
(of questionable status, but thought to be at least partially authentic) which is
— The beginnings of things —
34

preserved in a Greek work of the early Roman period.73 When the implications 
of these foreign parallels came to be appreciated, it came to be generally accepted
that the Greek succession myth was not of native origin, but was based on a myth
that had been introduced from the Near East.
If this was the case, a group of displaced earlier gods corresponding to the Titans
must have been introduced as part of the imported myth. The Hurro-Hittite equiv-
alents of the Titans were known as the former gods (Hesiod refers to the Titans or
Kronos in corresponding terms on two occasions),74 while their Babylonian equiv-
alents were known as the dead gods. If the question of the origin of the Titans is
viewed from this perspective, two possibilities arise. There may have been an early
group of native gods of that name who were identiﬁed with the former gods of the
imported myth; or else the name Titan was simply a title that was applied by 
the Greeks to the gods of eastern origin. There is no way of telling which alterna-
tive is true, and it makes little practical difference in any case, since we know
nothing whatever of the original nature of the Titans if they had once enjoyed a
separate existence in Greece. The essential point is that the Titans, as they are known
to us as a collective body from the time of Hesiod onwards, are precisely what they
are presented as being in the succession myth of eastern origin, the former ruling
gods who were banished from the upper world when the present divine order was
established. This is their ‘nature’, and nothing is served by enquiring any further;
they have no other stories or functions as a collective body in conventional myth,
and they had no place in Greek cult. The etymology of their name is uncertain;
there is some ancient evidence to suggest that it may have meant ‘princes’ or the
like. Hesiod offers an ingenious but obviously factitious double etymology, stating
that Ouranos conferred this title on them in reproach, ‘for he said that they strained
(titainontes) and insolently performed a dreadful deed, for which vengeance (tisin)
came to them afterwards’.75
To turn aside from the conventional mythology of the Titans for a moment, they ﬁgure
prominently in an esoteric myth of unusual interest; for in a tale that originated in the
Orphic literature, the human race is said to have sprung from the remains of the Titans
after Zeus had destroyed them with a thunderbolt. This came about in the following circum-
stances. Zeus raped his mother Rhea, who is here identiﬁed with Demeter, to father
Persephone; and he later had intercourse with Persephone in the form of a snake to father
Dionysos, who is often given the title of Zagreus in this connection. Zeus intended to make
Dionysos the ruler of the world, but the jealous Hera incited the Titans to attack him.
Diverting his attention with toys of various sorts, notably a mirror, they pulled him from
his throne and killed him; and they then tore him to pieces and devoured him. Athena
contrived to save his heart, however, and took it to Zeus, so making it possible for Dionysos
to be reborn from Semele. Zeus punished the Titans by destroying them with his thunder-
bolt, and the human race sprang up from the soot that was left from their bodies. Human
beings have been of mixed nature ever since, being partly divine, since the Titans had eaten
Dionysos Zagreus before they were destroyed, and partly wicked, owing to the wicked nature
of the Titans. This extraordinary myth, which contradicts normal Greek tradition at every
turn, was probably of quite early origin. Plato refers to the old Titanic nature of man in
the Laws, and there is reason to suppose that Pindar already knew of the story.76

Hesiod assigns individual names to all the Titans, listing six male Titans and six
females (known as the Titanides).77 In view of Kronos’ special role in the succes-
sion myth and his status as the second lord of the universe, he would surely have
been identiﬁed as a Titan in the prior tradition. Conﬁrmation of this can be found
in Homer, since Kronos is mentioned on three occasions in the Iliad as one of 
the banished gods in Tartaros (who are named as Titans on one occasion).78 The
formulaic epithets Kronios and Kronides which are regularly applied to Zeus in the
Homeric epics are indication enough that Kronos had been regarded as the father
of Zeus from very ancient times; since such epithets are not applied to any other
deity, Zeus may perhaps have been his only child in the original tradition. 
It is quite likely that Kronos was ﬁrst brought into the succession myth, and thus 
enlisted as a Titan, because he was the acknowledged father of Zeus in the native
tradition. Kronos’ consort Rhea also has a special place in the succession myth as
the ‘mother of the gods’ (i.e. of the ﬁrst generation of Olympian gods) and by virtue
of the crucial role that she plays in saving Zeus from being swallowed by Kronos.
She is named as a Titan in the Theogony, and had presumably been long identiﬁed
as such (unless the Titans were once thought to be exclusively male). Since 
Iapetos (the father of Atlas, Menoitios and Prometheus, see below) is mentioned
along with Kronos in the Iliad as a god imprisoned in Tartaros, it would seem 
that he too had come to be classed as a Titan by the time of Homer and Hesiod,
perhaps because he was a father of children who were enemies of Zeus.79 There is
no comparable evidence to show whether any other Titan in Hesiod’s list was already
known as such.
It is obvious from a casual glance that the deities in Hesiod’s list of Titans are
of such disparate nature and origin that they could not possibly have formed a
common group from very early times. Some have Greek names, others foreign names; 
some are nature-gods, some are abstractions, some are nonentities who were prob-
ably never anything more than genealogical links. Some of them, moreover, for
reasons that will be considered presently, could not have shared the common fate
of the Titans as former gods who were banished forever. It is altogether probable
that the Titans, with the possible exception of Kronos, were originally an anony-
mous collective body, and one may suspect that most of the deities in the standard
list, as established in the Theogony, were ﬁrst named as Titans by Hesiod himself
(who may also may also have been the ﬁrst to establish that they were speciﬁcally
twelve in number). It was essential that he should provide them with a full set of
names if he was to draw them into his genealogical system; and he liked to assign
appropriate names to members of groups of deities in any case, even to the many
Nereids and Ocean-nymphs.
We must now consider why the speciﬁc deities named by Hesiod should have
been enrolled as Titans. Kronos, Rhea and Iapetos have already been discussed,
as deities who were almost certainly named as Titans in the existing tradition.
Okeanos was the god of the outer Ocean, the great river that supposedly encircled
the earth and was the source of all other waters, salt and sweet alike.80 It could
obviously be assumed that the lord of these waters must have been a very ancient
deity who had been at his post from the very earliest times. According to a passage
in the Iliad, indeed, he and his consort Tethys were none other than the ﬁrst couple
— The beginnings of things —
36

from whom all the gods had sprung81 (an idea that was apparently derived from a
Babylonian myth in which Apsu and Tiamat, representing the sweet and salt waters
respectively, were portrayed as the ﬁrst couple). Even if they could not be regarded
as the ﬁrst gods of all in the context of the succession myth, Hesiod accords them
only a slightly lower status by including them among the Titans, as would be 
ﬁtting for venerable deities whose union could account for the origin of all the lesser
streams of the world. Okeanos seems ill-ﬁtted, on the other hand, to share in the
collective actions and fate of the Titans, since his streams are a permanent feature
of the world and one might suppose that he would be obliged to remain in them
at the edges of the earth. The story in the latter part of the Theogony in which he
tells his daughter Styx to assist Zeus against the Titans82 (see p. 49) is consistent
with the thought that he did not join with the other Titans in ﬁghting against
Zeus; and in Apollodorus’ theogony, in which the Titans are presented as attack-
ing Ouranos as a collective body, it is explicitly stated that Okeanos took no 
part in that enterprise.83 Themis, the personiﬁcation of law and right order, and
Mnemosyne, the personiﬁcation of memory, belong very appropriately among the
Titans in so far as they represent ancient and fundamental forces in the world; but
it can hardly be imagined, on the other hand, that they have been banished from
the world since the fall of the Titans. Even in the Theogony itself (though in a part
of the poem that may have been added after Hesiod’s time), they reappear after the
banishment of the Titans as early wives of Zeus. Themis ﬁgures, furthermore, as we
will see, in a number of myths set in the Olympian era.
The other Titans in Hesiod’s list are obscure deities who are of genealogical signiﬁ-
cance alone; none have any recorded myths, and they may well have had no stories
even in Hesiod’s time, being remembered only as parents or ancestors of more
important deities (if they were not invented by the poet himself, as is possible in
one or two cases). Hyperion is mentioned in the Homeric epics and other early
poetry as the father of the sun-god Helios; and his name is also used on occasion
as a title of Helios himself.84 Since the sun and other main luminaries of the sky
must have come into existence at an early stage in the development of the world,
Hyperion could be ﬁttingly enlisted as their Titan father. Koios also ﬁnds a natural
place among the Titans as the father of Leto, who was the mother of two major
Olympian deities, Artemis and Apollo. Hyperion and Koios have Titan consorts
assigned to them, Theia, ‘the Divine’ and Phoibe, ‘the Radiant’, respectively; it
required no great ingenuity, whether on the part of Hesiod or some predecessor, to
invent ﬁgures such as these. And ﬁnally there is Kreios (or Krios), whose nature
and origin are a mystery. As we will see, he served a useful if minor genealogical
function by fathering husbands for some early goddesses. There was not always
complete agreement on the identity of the Titans in the subsequent tradition;
Apollodorus, for instance, omits Phoibe, replacing her with Dione85 (the consort of
Zeus at Dodona, and mother of Aphrodite in one account, see p. 80).
In addition to fathering children by Gaia through his marital relations, Ouranos
caused her to conceive some further children in less conventional circumstances; for
when Kronos severed his genitals and threw them away (see further on p. 67), some
blood gushed out of them on to the ground, causing Gaia to become pregnant with
three sets of children, the Erinyes, the Giants (Gigantes in Greek) and the Meliai.86

The Giants will be discussed in the next chapter in connection with their revolt
against Zeus and the Olympian order (see pp. 86ff). It is likely that they had always
been regarded as earth-born, as their Greek name would suggest; and since they
were superhuman beings who were akin to the gods (though not fully divine), 
it could be appropriately added that the fertilizing power of the divine blood of
Ouranos had caused the earth to bring them forth. This detail may well have been
invented by Hesiod himself. It is likely that he would have regarded them as beings
of relatively minor importance, since the myth of their revolt against Zeus probably
originated after his time (see p. 86). The Meliai were a race of nymphs, ash-tree
nymphs in the strict sense; but since Hesiod offers no separate account of the 
origin of others of their kind, he is presumably using the term in a general sense
to cover all forms of tree-nymph. As one of the most important forms of nymph,
tree-nymphs will be considered along with the other nymphs in Chapter 6. These
nymphs resemble the Giants in being more than human and less than divine. The
remaining set of children, the Erinyes, are the only ones that will require any
detailed examination here.
The ERINYES or FURIES were avenging spirits who exacted terrible but just
retribution against people who committed murder and other grave crimes, especially
within the family. Since Hesiod says nothing at all about their activities, we must
turn to Homer to gain an idea of the kinds of offence that they were thought to
punish in early tradition. The Iliad tells how Amyntor cursed his son Phoinix 
to the Erinyes for having seduced his concubine (see p. 458); and when Althaia
cursed her son Meleagros for having killed some brothers of hers, ‘the Erinys who
walks in darkness and is pitiless of heart heard her from Erebos’.87 Or in the Odyssey,
Telemachos suggests that his mother Penelope might curse him to the Erinyes if
he should send her away, and Odysseus remarks that Oedipus has been sorely
troubled by the Erinyes of his mother since she hanged herself88 (after discovering
that her husband Oedipus was also her son, see p. 311). In a fragment from another
early epic, the Thebais, the Erinys is said to have paid due heed to Oedipus when
he cursed his sons (see p. 315).89 These sources and others of the kind indicate that
the Erinyes were thought to take a special interest in offences committed by one
member of a family against another (especially younger against older, child against
parent), and were often spurred into action by a curse from the injured party. It is
therefore ﬁtting that Hesiod should present them as having been born as a conse-
quence of an offence that had been committed by a son against his father.
Other allusions in the Homeric epics show that the Erinyes also had broader
concerns. Homer remarks in the ﬁrst place that anyone who swears a false oath will
be punished by the Erinyes in the world below;90 and Hesiod alludes to this func-
tion in ﬁgurative terms in the Works and Days when he says that the Erinyes assisted
at the birth of Horkos (see further on p. 31).91 They became the main agents of
retribution in the Underworld in the late tradition, punishing the dead for sins of
any kind. It is remarked in the Odyssey, though as a mere possibility, that even
beggars may have their Erinyes92 (for they have no one else to avenge them). Most
interesting of all, however, is a passage in the Iliad which suggests that they may
act to uphold the proper order of things even where no human offence is involved;
— The beginnings of things —
38

for after Xanthos, one of the divine chariot-horses of Achilles, had spoken aloud to
address a prophecy to his master, the Erinyes cut off his voice (plainly because it is
unnatural for horses to speak).93 The aphoristic philosopher Heraclitus (mid-sixth
century BC) writes correspondingly – though obviously in a more ﬁgurative vein –
that ‘the Sun will not overstep his measures, for if he does, the Erinyes, ministers
of justice, will seek him out’.94
Their most celebrated stories in heroic mythology relate nonetheless to offences
within the family, telling how they punished two Argive heroes, Orestes and
Alkmaion, for having killed their mothers (see pp. 327 and 511). Although both
young men took this drastic action to avenge the death of their father, and even
gained the consent of Apollo at Delphi beforehand, the Erinyes knew no pity in
such cases, and took no account of mitigating circumstances; the deed was their sole
concern. They thus embody early ideas of justice from the time before it came to
be appreciated that animus is a necessary part of every crime, and that a deed which
is committed through mere accident or as a result of force majeure does not carry
with it the full moral or legal responsibility of a deliberate act. Yet even so, they
are a long way from representing the most primitive stages of moral consciousness,
for they punish, not families or clans, but solely the individual who commits 
the deed. They may, however, be said to represent the moral ideas of the clan, for
they are regularly on the side of the elders, not only of fathers or mothers but also
of elder brothers.
In art and literature, they are regularly represented as formidable beings, stern 
of aspect, carrying torches and scourges, and generally wreathed with serpents, or
having serpents in their hair or carrying them in their hands. They were presented
in an especially loathsome form in Aeschylus’ Eumenides, as dark vampire-like crea-
tures who crawled around on all fours, with pus oozing from their eyes and sinister
rasping breath;95 it was said, indeed, that they were so horrifying at the ﬁrst perform-
ance that women in the audience suffered miscarriages. But it is noteworthy, as an
example of the Greek hatred for all that is monstrously hideous, that no artist 
makes the Erinyes ugly or misshapen; they are rather beautiful but ﬁerce-looking
women, known for what they are by their expression and the scourges and other
implements which they carry, and in general as unlike Etruscan or medieval devils
as possible.
The Erinyes have no individual names in the early tradition, and are of indeter-
minate number; it is not until the Roman period that the idea appears that there
were three of them named Alekto, Tisiphone and Megaira.96 Aeschylus and some
later authors depart from Hesiod by classing them as daughters of Night, as seems
appropriate enough, while Sophocles describes them as daughters of Skotos (Darkness
personiﬁed) and Earth.97 They were equated with the Eumenides (Kindly Ones) and
Semnai (Venerable Ones), goddesses of gentler aspect and more propitious name
who were honoured in cult at Athens and elsewhere. They had no equivalents in
Roman belief, their Latin name, Furiae, being perhaps no more than an attempt at
a translation (furere, to be raging mad, being taken as an equivalent to Greek
erineuein); as the Furiae, they were sometimes identiﬁed with an obscure Roman
goddess, Furrina.

DESCENDANTS OF THE TITANS
In considering the families of the Titans, we will exclude for the present the Titans
who were the ancestors of the Olympian gods, and also those who became wives or
mistresses of Zeus. If Kronos and Rhea, the founders of the main Olympian 
line, and Koios and Phoibe, the grandparents of Apollo and Artemis, are therefore
put aside along with Themis and Mnemosyne, who will both enter into liaisons 
with Zeus, we are left with four Titan families whose members will consist mainly
of deities who are connected with the natural world and its ordering. Two of these
families are founded by Titan couples, namely Okeanos and Tethys, and Hyperion
and Theia, while the two others are founded by male Titans who wed outside the
circle of their sisters, namely Iapetos, who married his Okeanid niece Klymene, 
and Kreios, who married into the other family of Gaia by taking Eurybia, daughter
of Pontos, as his wife. For a survey of the origins of the Olympian gods, see p. 80;
and for the children of the Titans Themis and Mnemosyne, see p. 78.
Okeanos and Tethys and their children the Okeanids and rivers
OKEANOS was the god of the Ocean (Okeanos, a word of non-Greek origin), a
great river that was thought to encircle the lands of the earth on every side. The
goddess TETHYS was traditionally regarded as his wife; indeed in one tradition, as
we have just seen, the pair were regarded as the ﬁrst couple and the ancestors of
the other gods. Hesiod, who has other ideas on that matter, acknowledges the vener-
able status of Okeanos, at least as the source of all the rivers and springs of the
earth, by classing him as the eldest of the Titans.98 Even if he was not a nonentity
like some of his brothers and sisters, he lived too far away and was too closely iden-
tiﬁed with his streams to make many appearances in mythical narratives. The Iliad
reports that Rhea entrusted her daughter Hera to Okeanos and Tethys to be reared
in their palace in the Ocean while Zeus was confronting Kronos and the Titans;
and Pherecydes recounts a tale in which Okeanos tried to intimidate Herakles 
by raising his waves while the hero was crossing his waters to fetch the cattle of
Geryoneus (see p. 264).99 The god appears on the stage in the Prometheus Bound,
arriving on a grifﬁn or some creature of the kind to offer sympathy and advice 
to the enchained Prometheus.100 Tethys came to be identiﬁed with the sea in
Hellenistic and later times; an astral myth suggests that she refuses to allow the
Great Bear to set into the sea out of consideration for the feelings of her former
foster-child Hera (for this polar constellation, which never sets below the horizon,
was supposed to represent a former mistress of Zeus, Kallisto, who had been
transformed into a bear, see p. 541).101
Okeanos and Tethys produced 3,000 (i.e. innumerable) sons, comprising all the
RIVERS of the world (Potamoi, which are masculine in Greek), and 3,000 daugh-
ters, the Ocean-nymphs or OKEANIDS (Okeanidai, or Okeaninai). The functions
of the latter were by no means conﬁned to the water; Hesiod remarks that they are
scattered everywhere, haunting the earth and deep waters alike, and observes in
particular that they watch over the young.102

40

The Theogony offers a catalogue of forty-one Okeanids. Although the names of many of them
are no more than poetic inventions as in the case of the Nereids, a few noteworthy ﬁgures
may be found among them. Metis, the personiﬁcation of cunning intelligence, was swal-
lowed by Zeus after conceiving Athena to him, and reappears accordingly in a later section
of the Theogony (see p. 77), as does the Okeanid Eurynome, who bore the Charites to him
(see p. 78). Peitho (Persuasion), who presided over all forms of persuasion from the political
to the amatory, was often regarded as an attendant of Aphrodite (see p. 198). Tyche (Fortune,
equivalent to the Roman Fortuna) became a goddess of some importance in Hellenistic and
later times when she came to be widely honoured in cult both as a universal power and in
relation to the fortunes of particular places or potentates. Dione, who was sometimes
regarded as a consort of Zeus, was the mother of Aphrodite in the Homeric account (see 
p. 80). Hesiod includes a Kalypso in the list, but it need not be assumed that he had the
lover of Odysseus (see p. 497) in mind; although Odysseus’ liaison with the goddess of that
name is mentioned in the present text of the Theogony, the reference comes at the very end
of the poem in a section that was added after Hesiod’s time.103 Homer describes her as a
daughter of Atlas. Doris was the wife of Nereus and mother of the Nereids (see p. 51),
Klymene the wife of the Titan Iapetos (see p. 49), Kallirhoe the wife of Chrysaor and
mother of Geryoneus (see p. 62), Perseis the wife of Helios, and Iduia the wife of Aietes,
king of Colchis. If Hesiod places Styx, the goddess of the infernal river of that name, at the
end of the list, he indicates that he is doing so because he regards her as the most import-
ant of the Okeanids;104 she will be considered below in connection with her husband (see 
p. 49). Most of the maidens who are named as attendants of Persephone in the Homeric Hymn
to Demeter are Okeanids from Hesiod’s list.105 Apollodorus classes Amphitrite, the consort
of Poseidon, as an Okeanid rather than as a Nereid as in the Theogony.106 The chorus in the
Prometheus Bound is formed from a group of Okeanids.
On the male side of the family, Hesiod names only a few of the most notable
RIVERS by way of example; and we will narrow the range further by picking out
the four that are of greatest interest from a mythological point of view, the Eridanos,
Acheloos, Alpheios and Skamandros. Originally a mythical stream that lay some-
where in north-west Europe, the ERIDANOS came to be identiﬁed with the Po107
(or sometimes with the Rhône, or with both rivers in a geographically impossible
combination, see p. 393). Phaethon was supposed to have plunged into it when 
he fell from the chariot of the Sun (see p. 45), and the Argonauts were sometimes
said to have sailed along it during their return journey, to pass from the head of
the Adriatic to the western Mediterranean (see p. 394). Since amber was conveyed
from the Baltic to the Mediterranean by way of the river-systems of western Europe
(among other routes), it is understandable that the Eridanos should have come to
be regarded as its source in Greek lore;108 for the legend that was devised to explain
why amber appears in the river, see p. 45. The Greeks applied the name of the 
river to the great river-like constellation in the southern sky that is still known 
as Eridanus.109 The god of the Eridanos has no myths as a personal being. The
ACHELOOS, which rose in Epirus in north-western Greece and ﬂowed to the sea
near the northern entrance to the Corinthian Gulf, was the largest river in Greece.
The river and its god play a signiﬁcant role in the legend of the Argive hero
Alkmaion (see p. 327); and Herakles wrestled with him for the hand of Deianeira,
who came from Calydon not far from his streams (see p. 280).

Acheloos also appears in two transformation myths recounted by Ovid. According to one,
some naiad nymphs forgot to invite him to a local sacriﬁce and festival along with other 
deities of the area, causing him to swell with rage until his waters ﬂooded over and washed
them out to sea to become the Echinades, a group of islands just outside the Corinthian 
Gulf, not far from the mouth of the Acheloos.110 The other tale tells how he once seduced
a maiden called Perimele, whose father Hippodamas was so angry to learn of it that he
hurled her over a cliff into the sea. Acheloos held her up in the water, however, and appealed
for the help of Poseidon, who turned her into an island that was known by her name.111
The god of the ALPHEIOS, the longest river in the Peloponnese, was famous for
his love of ARETHOUSA, a Syracusan spring-nymph. Although the idea of the
river’s journey through the sea to Sicily was certainly quite old since it was known
to Ibycus and Pindar, the bucolic poet Moschus (second century BC) is the ﬁrst
author to state that Alpheios made the journey out of love. Emerging from his river-
mouth, he dived into the depths of the sea, passing through it in such a way that
his own waters never mingled with its salt-waters.112 Ovid and Pausanias explain
the origin of the Syracusan spring through transformation-stories. According to
Ovid, Arethousa was originally a Peloponnesian nymph who was more interested in
hunting than love, but inadvertently awakened the love of Alpheios by bathing
naked in his waters after a hunting-trip. When he pursued her afterwards, Artemis
tried to rescue her from him by ﬁrst enveloping her in a mist and then transforming
her into a stream; but since Alpheios simply resumed his original form to mingle
his waters with those of the newly created stream, Artemis was obliged to take
further action by opening up a cleft in the earth to enable Arethousa to escape to
Sicily, where she formed the spring that bore her name.113 Ovid does not state that
Alpheios travelled to Syracuse thereafter to pursue his love, as in the traditional
story; and we are presumably not meant to assume this, for Artemis arranged her
removal to Sicily for the speciﬁc purpose of preventing Alpheios from mingling with
her. In Pausanias’ account, Alpheios also acquired his ﬁnal form as the result of a
transformation, for he was originally a Peloponnesian hunter who fell in love with
a huntress called Arethousa. As is generally the case with huntresses in myth, she
had no desire to marry him or anyone else, and therefore ﬂed across the sea to
Syracuse, where she was turned into a spring in unexplained circumstances; and
Alpheios was then turned into a river ‘out of love’ (presumably to enable him to
mingle with the spring).114
The SKAMANDROS (Scamander) is familiar from the Iliad as the main river of
the Trojan plain. Homer reports that it sprang up from two adjoining springs, one
steaming hot and the other ice-cold, and was known to the gods as Xanthos115
(the Yellow River, evidently because it was coloured by the soil that was carried in
its waters). Skamandros was highly honoured by the Trojans, who sacriﬁced many 
bulls to him and used to cast living horses into his streams.116 While Achilles 
was advancing against Troy after the death of Patroklos, he gravely offended
Skamandros by polluting his waters with a multitude of Trojan corpses; and on ﬁnd-
ing that his protests were greeted with contempt, the river-god overﬂowed his banks,
casting the bodies ashore and almost drowning Achilles. When he then called on the
assistance of Simoeis, the other main river of the Trojan plain, Achilles would surely
— The beginnings of things —
42

have perished if Hera (an eager supporter of the Greeks) had not asked Hephaistos 
to force Skamandros to return to his courses by setting ﬁre to his banks.117 Later
sources report that Teukros, the ﬁrst king of Troy, was a son of Skamandros, and 
that two subsequent kings, Tros and Laomedon, were married to daughters of his 
(see p. 521ff).118 This reﬂects a common pattern in which primordial rulers or their
wives are classed as children of local river-gods, as is understandable since rivers are
such prominent features of the untransformed landscape.
According to a tradition mentioned by Aristotle, the Skamandros was called the Xanthos
because it turned sheep yellow if they drank from it. This idea inspired a late myth in which
Hera, Athena and Aphrodite (or the latter alone) were said to have bathed in it to turn their
hair gold before the judgement of Paris.119
The children and descendants of Hyperion and Theia
The Titan HYPERION and his wife and sister THEIA, who have no myths of their
own, were the parents of three children who brought light to the heavens, Helios
(the Sun, Sol in Latin), Selene (the Moon, Luna in Latin) and Eos (Dawn, Aurora
in Latin).120 These deities were little worshipped in Greece, although HELIOS was
often invoked in oaths in his capacity as an all-seeing god who would be able to
bear witness to any perjury. His most important cultic centre was Rhodes, where
he was honoured as a god of the very ﬁrst rank. Pindar recounts a legend that
explains how he came to be lord of the island. Long ago, when the gods were
dividing the earth among themselves, Helios was granted no land of his own because
he happened to be absent (presumably on his daily journey through the sky).
Although Zeus offered to make amends by ordering a recasting of the lot, Helios
told him that he would be satisﬁed with a wonderful new land that he had seen
rising up from the sea, the fertile island of Rhodes. So he took Rhodes as his bride
and fathered seven sons by her, one of whom (named elsewhere as Kerkaphos) was
destined to father the eponyms of the three greatest cities of the island, Ialsysos,
Kameiros and Lindos.121 On the mainland, Helios was most highly honoured at
Corinth; see p. 103 for the story of how he competed with Poseidon for the city
and land. From the classical period onwards, he was sometimes identiﬁed with
Apollo, who was a radiant deity like himself.122 The fact that both gods were archers
(the Sun’s rays being described as his arrows by a common and natural metaphor)
may have encouraged the identiﬁcation.
In art and literature Helios is normally represented as a charioteer who drives
across the sky each day from east to west (although he is also imagined very occa-
sionally as riding on horseback, or as ﬂying on his own wings); in pictorial images,
his head is often surrounded with a nimbus and rays of light. His chariot-team
consists of four (or less commonly, two) gleaming horses, which are usually winged
in earlier images. The poets liked to give them appropriate names such as Pyroeis
(Fiery), Eoos (Orient), Aithon or Aithops (Blazing), Phlegon (Flaming) and the
like.123 Helios plunged into the stream of Ocean in the furthermost west after his
daily journey, where he bathed and relaxed before travelling back to the east during
the night. It was naïvely imagined that he made this journey by ﬂoating around

the encircling Ocean in a huge golden cup which had been made for him by
Hephaistos; he lent it to Herakles on one or two occasions as we shall see (pp. 264
and 271). His palace lay near the sunrise in the east (although we occasionally hear
of a western palace in the late tradition). According to the early elegiac poet
Mimnermus, he kept his sunbeams in a golden chamber in his palace.124
It is mentioned in the Odyssey that Helios owned seven herds of immortal cattle
and seven ﬂocks of sheep which were pastured by two of his daughters on Thrinacia,
an island vaguely situated in the remote west (though later identiﬁed with Sicily).
When detained on this island by bad weather, the followers of Odysseus killed some
of the cattle to satisfy their hunger even though their leader had expressly ordered
them not to, an act of sacrilege that was reported to Helios by his daughter Lampetie.
Helios was so angry that he approached Zeus and the other gods with his griev-
ance, threatening to desert the sky and shine among the dead in Hades if he was
not adequately avenged; so Zeus took action on his behalf by striking Odysseus’
ship with a thunderbolt, causing the death of everyone on it apart from Odysseus
himself (see also on p. 497).125 Helios also appears in a wholly different context in
the Odyssey, as the all-seeing god who informed Hephaistos that his wife Aphrodite
was engaging in an adulterous love affair with Ares (see p. 201). By virtue of his
position in the sky, he is able to perform a comparable service for Demeter in the
Homeric Hymn to Demeter, by telling her that her daughter has been carried away by
Hades (see p. 127).126
Augeias, king of Elis, was sometimes said to have acquired his innumerable cattle (see p.
260) from his father Helios; according to Theocritus, twelve of them were special swan-
white beasts that were sacred to Helios.127 For the tales in which Helios was said to have
reversed his course to provide a portent for Atreus or in horror at the cannibal meal served
by Atreus, see p. 506.
The ofﬁcial consort of Helios, if one may so call her, was Perse or Perseis, daughter
of Okeanos, who bore him two children in the earliest tradition, Aietes, king of
Colchis, whose legend will be recounted in connection with the Argonauts, and the
enchantress Kirke, whose remote island home was visited by Odysseus (see p. 494)
and the Argonauts (see p. 395). Further children are credited to the couple in later
sources, most notably Pasiphae, the wife of Minos, and Aloeus, a primordial king
of Sicyonia (see p. 432).128 Lampetie and Phaethousa, who tended the cattle of Helios
on Thrinacia, are described in the Odyssey as daughters of his by a certain Neaira.129
The most notable of the illegitimate children of Helios was PHAETHON (‘the
Radiant’), who was borne to him by Klymene, the wife of Merops, king of the
Ethiopians; this Klymene is said to have been a daughter of Okeanos like the wife
of Helios (although she must obviously be distinguished from the Okeanid of that
name who is the wife of Iapetos in the Theogony).130 Although there is no very early
evidence for the famous legend of Phaethon’s misadventure with his father’s chariot,
the story was probably recounted in the Hesiodic literature131 (whether the Catalogue
or the Astronomy) and certainly in the lost Heliades of Aeschylus. The story takes the
following form in the fullest narrative by Ovid. Phaethon was reared by Klymene
in her husband’s palace, which lay in the remote east no great distance from the
— The beginnings of things —
44

palace of Helios. She told him that he was a son of Helios, and he bragged about
his high descent until one of his comrades could stand it no longer and retorted
that it was a lie. When he approached his mother for reassurance, she swore by
Helios himself that she had spoken the truth and advised him to visit his father’s
palace if he wanted further conﬁrmation. So he set off for the splendid palace of the
sun-god, which had walls and pillars of gleaming metal and a roof of ivory; and he
received a kindly welcome from Helios, who acknowledged him as his son and
offered him the choice of whatever he most desired. When he responded by asking
to drive the chariot of the sun across the sky on the following day, Helios tried to
warn of the dangers, but was ﬁnally obliged to grant his consent in accordance with
his promise. As Helios had foreseen, Phaethon was unable to control the spirited
chariot-horses and drove an erratic course, sometimes soaring too high and some-
times descending too low, much to the alarm of Earth, who began to fear for her
own survival as her surface caught ﬁre and her waters dried up. So she appealed
urgently to Zeus, who hurled a thunderbolt at Phaethon, causing him to fall from
the chariot and plunge to his death in the river Eridanos (see p. 41) far below.132
All the main features of this story can be found in earlier sources; there was also a
slightly different version in which Phaethon mounted the chariot in secret without
gaining his father’s permission.133
Phaethon’s sisters, the HELIADES, mourned for him so grievously after his death
that Zeus or the gods took pity on them and transformed them into poplar-trees;
they continue to weep for their brother in their new form, shedding resinous 
tears into the Eridanos, hence the origin of amber.134 Or in a less favoured account,
their father transformed them into trees to punish them for yoking his chariot for
Phaethon without his consent.135 The death of Phaethon was also lamented by
KYKNOS, king of the Ligurians, a superb musician who had been a relative or
friend of his, or indeed his lover. The gods (or Apollo speciﬁcally) pitied his sorrow
and turned him into a swan (kyknos in Greek), a bird that shares his musical nature
and sings mournfully before it dies.136 Some accounts add that Kyknos was trans-
ferred to the sky to become the constellation of the Swan (Cygnus).137
When a myth was devised to explain the origin of the heliotrope, a plant that keeps its 
ﬂowers constantly turned toward the sun, Helios was bound to play a central part in it.
Ovid’s account runs as follows. On beholding LEUKOTHOE, daughter of Orchamos, king
of Persia, the most beautiful girl in the land of spices, Helios conceived a desperate passion
for her, forgetting all his previous loves. So he made his way into her room in the guise 
of her mother and dismissed her attendants, and then resumed his proper form in order to
seduce her. One of his former mistresses, a certain KLYTIE (who is described elsewhere 
as a sister of Leukothoe) was so jealous of Leukothoe that she caused it to become generally
known that she had a lover. On hearing the rumour, her cruel father buried her alive, and
she died before Helios could rescue her. Overcome by sorrow, he sprinkled nectar over her
body and the surrounding soil, causing an incense-tree to grow up in place of her. As for
Klytie, he would have nothing to do with her, and she pined away for love of him, refusing
all food and drink, until she ﬁnally turned into a heliotrope; and she retains her love for
Helios even in this new form, as is witnessed in the movement of the ﬂowers of the heliotrope.
In another account, the father of Leukothoe is called Orchomenos, which would imply that
her story is now set in Boeotia in mainland Greece.138

The gently radiant SELENE (or Selenaia, or quite often Mene in poetic usage), the
goddess of the moon, could be pictured as a charioteer like her brother; no one who
has seen the Parthenon marbles is likely to forget the marvellous head of one of her
chariot-horses that survives among them. Some authors specify that she drives a pair
rather than a four like her brother, in accordance with the standard image in vase-
paintings and other works of art. She is drawn by two snow-white horses or
occasionally by oxen. Or in some portrayals, she rides through the heavens on a
horse (or steer or mule, or even a ram), facing sideways with both legs on one ﬂank
of her mount.139 There is an attractive literary account of her journey through the
sky in the Homeric Hymn to Selene, which also reports that she once slept with Zeus
and bore him a daughter called Pandeia (an obscure ﬁgure whose name may have
been derived from a title of Selene).140 The only notable legend recorded for the
moon-goddess is the one that tells of her love for Endymion, a hero of Elis in the
western Peloponnese; see further on p. 411. There is also an interesting but poorly
attested legend in which Pan is said to have seduced her. Vergil mentions in passing
in the Georgics that he won her over by offering her the snowy ﬂeece of a sheep, and
the scholia report that the Hellenistic poet Nicander offered an account in which
Pan wrapped himself in a sheepskin to approach her.141 The rusticity of the tale
suggests that it may have originated as a local legend in Arcadia.
There is some disagreement about the descent of Selene. According to the Homeric Hymn to
Hermes, her father was Pallas, son of Megamedes (otherwise unknown),142 who may perhaps
be identiﬁed with the Pallas who is classed as a son of the Titan Kreios in the Theogony. Or
in the Homeric Hymn to Helios, Hyperion is said to have fathered her and her two siblings
by Euryphaessa (‘she who shines far and wide’) rather than by Theia.143 One or two passages
in tragedy refer to her as a daughter of Helios (rather than as his sister), which seems appro-
priate enough in view of her borrowed light.144 Herse (Dew), the goddess or personiﬁcation
of the dew, is described as a daughter of Zeus and Selene in a lyric fragment from Alcman,145
but this is really no more than an allegorical fancy referring to the heavy dew-fall associ-
ated with clear moonlit nights. Selene was quite often equated with Artemis in post-classical
times, just as Helios came to be equated with Apollo; this already seems to be implied in
a fragment from Aeschylus which suggests that Selene was a daughter of Leto.146 She was
of importance in magic as a goddess who could be appealed to in the laying of spells, espe-
cially love-spells; in the second Idyll of Theocritus, she is invoked by a girl who is portrayed
as laying a spell of this kind.147
The third child of the union between Hyperion and Theia was EOS (the Dawn,
Latin Aurora). As a light-bringing goddess who ascends into the sky ahead of Helios,
she represents something more than what we might ordinarily understand by the
dawn, namely the light of the new day (and, to an increasing extent, even daylight
without qualiﬁcation). Hemera, Day personiﬁed, was often identiﬁed with Eos as a
consequence, even if she is a separate being in the Theogony (see p. 24). Eos is usually
shown as winged in works of art, unlike her brother and sister; but in her capacity
as a light-bringer, she ascends in a chariot just as they do, commonly a two-horse
chariot like that of Selene. In poetry from Homer onwards, she is described by
picturesque epithets that refer to the colours of the sky at dawn, such as ‘rosy-
ﬁngered’ (rhododaktylos) or ‘saffron-robed’ (krokopeplos).148
— The beginnings of things —
46

Eos has a comparatively well-marked personality, being pictured as an amorous
goddess who liked to abduct handsome young men. The most famous and best-
recorded story of this kind is that which tells of her relationship with TITHONOS,
a son of Laomedon, king of Troy, and a brother of Priam. The legend was plainly
very ancient since both the Iliad and the Odyssey refer to Eos as rising ‘from 
her bed beside lordly Tithonos’ when she sets off to bring the light of day to gods
and mortals.149 Homer mentions that Tithonos was a son of Laomedon, and later
sources indicate that he was a legitimate child of the king (by Strymo, daughter of
Skamandros in most accounts).150 The Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite provides the earliest
full account of his story. Eos carried him off and asked Zeus to render him immortal,
but never thought to ask in addition that he should retain his youth and so be
exempted from the ravages of age. While he was still young, the two of them lived
happily together by the streams of Ocean at the edges of the earth; but when the
ﬁrst grey hairs began to sprout on his head and chin, Eos abandoned his bed 
even though she continued to take care of him in her house, providing him with
food and ambrosia and ﬁne clothing; and when he became so feeble that he could
no longer move his limbs, she laid him in a room behind closed doors, where he
has babbled away helplessly ever since.151 According to a familiar tale that ﬁrst
appears in the classical period, Eos ﬁnally transformed him into a musical insect,
the cicada (tettix).152 This idea was presumably inspired by the reference to the cease-
less talking (aspetos phe¯me¯) of the incapacitated Tithonos in the Homeric Hymn; the
high-pitched talk of old men is compared to the singing of cicadas in a famous
passage in the Iliad.153 It may also be relevant that cicadas were supposed to survive
on dew alone (for it would seem that Tithonos was no longer fed when he was 
shut up behind closed doors). It is stated in one late source that Eos transformed
him so as to be able to enjoy his song.154 In earlier and happier days, she bore him
two children, namely Memnon, king of the Ethiopians, who fought as an ally of
the Trojans in the last stages of the Trojan War (see p. 468), and Emathion, who 
was killed by Herakles in Ethiopia (see p. 271).155 We should imagine that the 
couple lived somewhere in the remote east near the dawn. Their son Memnon was
usually associated with the east accordingly, as we will see, rather than with the
African Ethiopia.
The Odyssey refers to two other love affairs of Eos, stating in the ﬁrst place that
she abducted the hunter Orion, causing resentment among the gods, who tended
to disapprove of liaisons between goddesses and mortals; so they incited Artemis to
kill him in his new home of Ortygia (usually identiﬁed with Delos in later times).156
This account of the death of Orion was displaced by other stories in the later tradi-
tion (see pp. 563–4). The Odyssey also mentions that Eos was so attracted by the
beauty of Kleitos, son of Mantios, a grandson of the great seer Melampous, that she
carried him away to dwell with the immortals.157 It is reported in the Theogony (in
a section added after Hesiod’s time) that Eos loved a certain Kephalos and bore him
a son Phaethon (not to be confused with the son of Helios above), who was seized
by Aphrodite to serve in her temple.158 Although this Kephalos – who was appar-
ently a son of Hermes – was properly a separate ﬁgure from the Kephalos, son of
Deion who was the husband of Prokris in Attic legend, the two were sometimes
identiﬁed in the later tradition, and Eos was occasionally introduced into the legend

of Kephalos and Prokris as a consequence (see further on p. 372). To explain the
over-susceptible nature of Eos, some claimed that Aphrodite caused her to be
constantly falling in love to punish her for having slept with Ares (who was
Aphrodite’s lover or husband).159
In addition to her many lovers, Eos had an ofﬁcial consort, ASTRAIOS (Starry),
a son of the Titan Kreios and the Okeanid Eurybia. Her children by this marriage
were the stars of the heavens and the three main winds, Boreas (the North Wind),
Zephyros (the West Wind) and Notos (the South Wind).160
Hesiod singles out the Morning Star, HEOSPHOROS, as the most notable of the starry
children of Eos. It should be remembered in this connection that the planets or ‘wandering
stars’ (plane¯tes asteres) were not regarded as being essentially different from the ﬁxed stars.
The planet now known as Venus was called Heosphoros (Dawn-bringer) and Phosphoros
(Light-bringer) in Greek in its nature as the Morning Star, or Hesperos as the Evening Star
(hesperos aste¯r); it was recognized quite early, however, certainly before the classical period,
that the two stars are one and the same. Even if Eos were not the mother of all the stars,
it might naturally be assumed that Heosphoros would be a child of hers since he is the
harbinger of the dawn. It was perhaps as a result of this initial thought, indeed, that Hesiod
decided to make her the mother of all the stars and gave her a starry husband. Although
Heosphoros has no surviving myths as a personal being, he makes some slight appearance
in the heroic genealogies as the father of Keux, husband of Alkyone (see p. 410), and of
Telauge, the mother of Autolykos.161
Eos was presumably regarded as a suitable mother for the winds because the wind often
rises at dawn in Greece. Hesiod classes the three greatest winds as her children while all
the harmful winds of inferior nature are described as offspring of the monstrous Typhon (see 
p. 84). Although ZEPHYROS (the West Wind) is characterized as a cleansing wind in the
Theogony and tends to be stormy in Homer, he is customarily viewed as mild and gentle in
the later tradition (an idea preserved in our English word ‘zephyr’). The divine messenger
Iris visits ‘ﬁerce-blowing Zephyros’ in his home in the Iliad, while he is dining there with
the other winds, to summon him and Boreas to blow on the funeral-pyre of Patroklos, for
Achilles had prayed for their help after it had failed to kindle.162 As we will see (p. 58),
Homer states that Zephyros fathered the horses of Achilles by a Harpy. BOREAS, the violent
North Wind, descended on Greece from his northern homeland of Thrace. His most
important story is the Athenian legend that told how he abducted Oreithuia, a princess of
that land, to make her his wife (see further on p. 371). She bore him twin sons, Zetes and
Kalais, the Boreads (Boreadai), who shared something of their father’s nature as winged
beings who could ﬂy swiftly through the air, and were famous for their pursuit of the Harpies
(see p. 387). As a consequence of his marital connection with Athens, Boreas brought special
help to the Athenians on more than one occasion (see p. 371). NOTOS, the god of the moist
west wind (which was considered to be unhealthy) never developed into a mythical ﬁgure
of any signiﬁcance. The Winds were usually pictured as winged and bearded, and often as
wild of aspect. According to differing conceptions that can both be found in Homer, the
winds could be regarded either as independent agents or as being subject to the control of
Aiolos, the lord of the winds (see p. 493).163
The children of Kreios and Eurybia
The Titan KREIOS (or Krios), a thoroughly obscure ﬁgure, married a daughter of
Pontos (Sea) called Eurybia. They had three sons, Astraios, Pallas and Perses, who
— The beginnings of things —
48

were of genealogical signiﬁcance alone as the husbands of Eos, Styx and Asterie
respectively, goddesses of greater individuality than themselves.164 Astraios has
already been considered in connection with Eos. PALLAS (genitive Pallantis, to be
distinguished from Pallas, gen. Pallados, the well-known title of Athena) married
STYX, the goddess of the infernal river of that name (see p. 109), who is classed
by Hesiod as the eldest of the Okeanid nymphs. As her children by Pallas, she gave
birth to four personiﬁcations, Zelos (Emulation or Glory), Nike (Victory), Kratos
(Strength or Power) and Bia (Might or Force).165 When the great war between the
Titans and the younger gods was about to break out and Zeus was assembling his
allies, Styx, at the urging of her father Okeanos, brought him her children, who all
represented forces that would be invaluable in the forthcoming conﬂict. Zeus was
duly grateful and paid high honour to Styx and her children, declaring that the
solemn oaths of the gods would be sworn by her waters, and that her children would
live with him forever (in so far as the qualities that they represent would become
attributes of his own).166 When serious disputes arose between the gods thereafter,
Zeus would send Iris to the Underworld to fetch some water from Styx in a golden
jug; and if any god swore falsely by it, he would be deprived of nectar and ambrosia
for a year (and so rendered insensible), and would be banished from the company
of the gods for nine years.167 PERSES, the remaining son of Kreios and Eurybia,
married Asteria, a daughter of the Titans Koios and Phoibe, and fathered the goddess
Hekate by her (see p. 193).168 Hesiod remarks that he was pre-eminent for his
wisdom, but no myths are recorded to show how he displayed it. He should be
distinguished from two mortal heroes of the same name, a brother of Aietes (see 
p. 400) and a son of Perseus (see p. 242).
The children of Iapetos and Klymene
The Titan IAPETOS married the Okeanid Klymene (or the Okeanid Asia) and
fathered four sons by her, Prometheus and Epimetheus, whose interrelated myths
will be considered in the next chapter (see pp. 92ff), and Atlas, who supported the
heavens, and the comparatively obscure Menoitios.169 Hesiod indicates that
MENOITIOS clashed with Zeus like his more famous brother Prometheus, but offers
no details, merely stating that Zeus struck him with a thunderbolt and hurled him
down to Erebos (the nether darkness, presumably of Tartaros) on account of his folly
and presumption.170 It appears that later authors knew little more about him than
we do. Apollodorus remarks, to be sure, that he was struck down by Zeus during
the war between the Titans and the younger gods (evidently because he was
supporting the Titans), but this may well be some mythographer’s conjecture rather
than a genuine early tradition.171
ATLAS performed the arduous but essential duty of holding up the sky. Much as
in the case of Menoitios, it was suggested in later times that he had angered Zeus by
supporting (or even leading) the Titans in their war with the younger gods, and was
burdened with this duty as a consequence;172 but there is no reason to assume that it
was regarded as a punishment for some speciﬁc offence in the early tradition.
According to the Theogony, he supports the sky on his head and hands, standing at the
edges of the earth near the Hesperides (i.e. in the far west); or in a gentler account in

the Odyssey, he holds the tall pillars that keep the earth and sky apart, apparently
standing somewhere in the sea.173 In works of art he is usually shown holding up a
globe that represents the sky (and sometimes has ﬁgures of the constellations marked
on it accordingly). Although Pausanias states that he was shown holding up the earth
and sky in images on the chest of Kypselos and the barriers around the statue of Zeus
at Olympia,174 the artists had presumably intended the globe to represent the sky
alone. Herodotus is our earliest source for the rationalistic account in which sky was
said to rest on Mt Atlas in the western reaches of North Africa.175 Atlas lived so far
away and was so constrained by his task that there was little occasion for him to 
appear in heroic myth; indeed, the story in which Herakles took over his burden while
he went to fetch the apples of the Hesperides (see p. 272) is his only myth of that
nature that is at all ancient. He was of genealogical importance nonetheless as the
founder of one of the great heroic families, that of the Atlantids; see Chapter 15.
THE FAMILY OF PONTOS AND GAIA
Gaia founded another family of a rather different nature by mating with her son
PONTOS (Sea). Most of its members were either nymphs of the waters, or else
monstrous beings who could be ﬁttingly imagined as having sprung from the form-
less element. Pontos himself is barely personiﬁed, and has no myths or cult; the
great god of the seas in the Greek tradition was Poseidon, an Olympian deity. Gaia
bore ﬁve children to Pontos, one of whom, Eurybia, has already been mentioned as
the wife of the Titan Kreios. Nereus was a sea-god who fathered a great many sea-
nymphs, the Nereids, and Thaumas was the father of the Harpies and of Iris,
goddess of the rainbow. Nereus and Thaumas took Okeanids from Gaia’s other
family as their wives, while Phorkys, who was a sea-god like Nereus, married his
sister Keto to found an alarming family of monsters.176

Nereus and Doris and their daughters the Nereids
NEREUS, the eldest son of Pontos and Gaia, was a sea-god who lived in a shining
cave in the depths of the sea with his many daughters, the Nereids. He was of
limited signiﬁcance in myth and of virtually none in cult, at least by classical times.
Hesiod describes him as truthful and never-deceiving, evidently because he was
gifted with prophetic powers (as was so often the case with sea-deities), and states
that he is called ‘the old one’ (ge¯ron, a title suggestive of the wisdom of old age)
because he is unerring and gentle and ever mindful of what is right.177 This name
of the ‘old one’ or ‘old man of the sea’ was a collective title which could also be
applied to other sea-gods who were of subordinate rank to Poseidon, such as Phorkys 
(see p. 58) and Proteus (see p. 484), who are both called by that title in the 
Odyssey.178 As Hesiod’s description would imply, Nereus seems to have been viewed
as a kindly, wise and helpful deity who was hardly ever formidable as sea-gods were
inclined to be. Nereus has only a single myth of any real note, the quite ancient
story in which Herakles wrestled with him to force him to reveal the route to the
Hesperides (see p. 269). Although he tried to escape by transforming himself into
water and ﬁre and all manner of different beasts, the hero kept a ﬁrm grip on him
until he was ﬁnally willing to speak;179 the struggle is depicted on vase-paintings
from the sixth and ﬁfth centuries BC, which show Nereus with a ﬁsh-tail initially
but later in fully human form. In another quite early tale, he delivered the cup of
the sun to Herakles after Helios had offered to lend it (see p. 264);180 and in one
of Horace’s odes, he imposes a calm to halt the ship of Paris after his abduction of
Helen and rises up from the sea to warn him of all the evil consequences that will
follow from his action.181 It is sometimes suggested in late sources that he reared
Aphrodite in his home under the sea.182
Nereus married the Okeanid Doris and fathered a large family of sea-nymphs, the
NEREIDS (Nereides), who lived with their parents under the sea.183 They were of

considerable signiﬁcance in popular belief and cult, far more so than Nereus himself.
Herodotus reports, for instance, that the Persians offered sacriﬁce to them in accord-
ance with Greek practice when their ﬂeet was once struck by a persistent storm off
the coast of Greece. With very few exceptions, they remained together as virgins,
emerging from their home only to sport with the sea-beasts in the waves above or
to dance on the shore.184 If Nereids were a form of mermaid in ancient belief
(although it should be noted that they were not ﬁsh-tailed), their name has come
to be applied to land-nymphs and fairies in modern Greece, quite displacing the
Dryads, Meliai and so forth. By another shift of meaning, the name Gorgon has
come to be applied to mermaids.
Poets exercised their ingenuity in devising pretty names for the Nereids, mostly
referring to the sea and seafaring, such as Neso or Nesaie, ‘island-girl’, Eulimine,
‘good-harbour-woman’, Kymatolege, ‘wave-stiller’, and Pontoporeia, ‘sea-farer’.
Hesiod provides a catalogue of ﬁfty names, and other lists which vary to differing
extents may be found in the Iliad, Apollodorus and Hyginus.185 The Nereids are
rarely accorded any speciﬁc role as a group in mythical narratives, although Homer
reports that they went ashore with their sister Thetis to mourn the deaths of
Patroklos and Achilles (see pp. 464 and 468), and it is stated in later epic that they
helped the Argonauts through the Wandering Rocks at the bidding of Hera (see 
p. 395).186 Three emerge as separate personalities with stories of their own, namely
Amphitrite, the queen of the seas, who will be considered later in connection with
her husband Poseidon (see p. 104), and Thetis, the mother of Achilles, who was
forced into an unhappy marriage with a mortal, and Galateia, who was courted by
the Kyklops Polyphemos in a relatively late myth set in Sicily. Mention should also
be made of a lesser Nereid, Psamathe, who was caught by surprise by Aiakos, king
of Aegina, and bore him a son Phokos (see p. 531).
The Nereid Thetis and her brief marriage to Peleus
THETIS was a beautiful Nereid who was once courted by both Poseidon and Zeus.
It was fated, however, that she would give birth to a son who would be more
powerful than his father; and the Titan Themis, who shared the prophetic powers
of her mother Gaia, alerted the two gods to this danger, adding that if either of
them should father this son by her, he would wield a weapon mightier than either
the thunderbolt or trident. Having gained power by deposing his own father just
as his father Kronos had before him, Zeus needed no second warning and agreed
with his brother that it would be safer to marry her off to a mortal. At the sugges-
tion of Themis, the Thessalian hero Peleus (see pp. 533ff) was selected for this
honour because of his exceptional piety. Such is the account offered by Pindar,187
who writes elsewhere that Zeus assigned Thetis to Peleus to reward him for his
righteousness in spurning the advances of the wife of Akastos (see p. 534).188
An idiosyncratic version of this story was offered in the Prometheus trilogy ascribed to
Aeschylus. We are told in the surviving Prometheus Bound that Prometheus has learned from
Gaia (who is here described as his mother and is equated with Themis189) that Zeus is fated
to father a son mightier than himself and meet his downfall if he marries a certain bride;
— The beginnings of things —
52

but because he has quarrelled with Zeus and been persecuted by him as a consequence, he
refuses to disclose the identity of this bride, even though he is warned by Hermes that Zeus
will inﬂict even worse sufferings on him if he persists in his refusal.190 It would seem,
however, that in the next play in the trilogy, the Prometheus Unbound, he revealed that Thetis
was the fateful bride, and so won his release.191 This account of the story was presumably
invented by the playwright himself for his own immediate purposes. On the course of events
in the trilogy, see further on p. 95.
In a wholly different version from the Cypria, the ﬁrst epic in the Trojan cycle, it
was Thetis herself who rejected the idea of a union between herself and Zeus, out
of respect for the feelings of Hera; for according to an ancient tradition that can be
traced back to the Iliad, Thetis had been fostered and reared by Hera. Zeus was so
angered by the rebuff that he swore that she would have a mortal for a husband.
This version was apparently recounted in the Hesiodic Catalogue too.192
However it came to be decided that Thetis should be married to a mortal, this
was not a prospect that she would willingly accept, and Peleus was therefore obliged
to capture her by force in the ﬁrst place, which was by no means easy considering
that she was a sea-goddess who could transform herself at will. He lay in wait for

her by the Thessalian coast and caught her by surprise as she emerged from the sea,
and then kept a ﬁrm grip on her even though she tried to escape from him by
assuming all manner of different forms. Pindar is the ﬁrst author to allude to the
story in the surviving literature, remarking that the goddess turned herself into ﬁre
and a lion with sharp claws and fearsome teeth; but Peleus’ capture of Thetis can
be traced back to the seventh century BC in the visual arts, and her transformations
are regularly indicated from the second half of the sixth century onwards.193 It is
clear from both the literary and artistic evidence that she was thought to have turned
herself into a lion and snake in particular; we know from Pausanias that the chest
of Kypselos already showed her with a snake emerging threateningly from her hand
(as an indication of the respective transformation).194 Authors from Herodotus and
Euripides onward often locate the incident at Cape Sepia in Thessaly, at the southern
end of the eastern coastal district of Magnesia. In connection with the great storm
that destroyed part of Xerxes’ ﬂeet in the area in 480 BC, Herodotus reports that
part of the coast was sacred to Thetis, and that the Persians offered sacriﬁce to her
and the Nereids.195 Later sources claim that Cape Sepia acquired its name because
Thetis turned herself into a cuttleﬁsh (se¯pia) during her struggle with Peleus, and
was at last overpowered by him while in that form.196 Peleus was sometimes said
to have been acting on the advice of the wise Centaur Cheiron when he ambushed
Thetis and seized her as his bride.197 It is likely that this story in which he wins 
her by his own exertions was of separate origin to that in which she is granted 
to him by Zeus, even if the two accounts do not necessarily conﬂict and came to
be combined in the later tradition.
This picturesque tale was bound to appeal to Ovid; in his version, Peleus met with failure
when he ﬁrst tried to make love to the goddess. She liked to ride in from the sea naked on
a dolphin to lie down in a cave by the shore, and Peleus happened to discover her there one
day while she was asleep. When his words failed to move her, he resorted to action instead
and wrapped his arms round her neck; but she proceeded to transform herself, ﬁrst into a
bird, then into a tree and lastly into a fearsome tigress, giving him such a fright that he
allowed her to escape. He then sought the help of the gods of the sea, offering libations and
sacriﬁces to them by the shore, until Proteus rose up and told him how his prospective bride
could be captured, advising him to bind her fast while she was asleep and then hold her
tight however often she transformed herself until she returned to her original shape. On
ﬁnding herself vanquished by these means, she recognized that he had beneﬁted from divine
aid and yielded to his will, revealing that she was Thetis.198
After Peleus had won Thetis through this rough courtship, their marriage was
formally celebrated on Mt Pelion in the presence of the gods.199 Homer already
mentions that they all attended the wedding, including Apollo with his lyre in
hand;200 and their procession as they approach Peleus’ house, some on foot and some
riding in chariots, is portrayed on some handsome vases from the sixth century
onwards, notably the François Krater. This wedding is cited by Pindar along with
that of Kadmos (who married the goddess Harmonia, see p. 297) as an illustration
of the highest happiness that could be attained by a mortal man;201 but the happi-
ness of Peleus was destined to be short-lived since Thetis continued to feel that the
— The beginnings of things —
54

union was unworthy of her, and abandoned her mortal husband soon after the birth
of their only child (or only surviving child) Achilles. It is explained in many accounts
that she was determined to have an immortal child and left home forever when her
hopes were frustrated. In the earliest tale of the kind, from a lost Hesiodic poem,
the Aigimios, she bore a series of children to Peleus and threw each of them into a
cauldron of boiling water at birth to test whether they were immortal; but after
many had perished as a consequence, Peleus stopped her from doing the same with
Achilles, provoking her to desert him in a fury.202 The Hellenistic poet Lycophron
offers a similar story, saying that she killed six sons in succession by hurling them
into a ﬁre (presumably for the same reason as above) before Peleus intervened to
rescue the seventh, Achilles.203 Or according to another tradition, she took active
measures to render Achilles immortal, just as Demeter had with her nursling
Demophoon (see p. 128), by dipping him into a ﬁre at night to burn away his
mortal ﬂesh, and rubbing his body with ambrosia by day to make it immortal and
ageless; but Peleus saw the child writhing in the ﬂames one night and cried out in
horror, causing Thetis to abandon the enterprise and leave home forever.204 It was
commonly agreed that she left in any case, and that Peleus entrusted the young
Achilles to the Centaur Cheiron to be reared and educated; see further on p. 458.
For the late story in which Thetis is said to have rendered Achilles partly invul-
nerable at least by dipping him into the river Styx, see pp. 456–7.
The Nereid Galateia and her admirer Polyphemos
According to a relatively late and none too serious legend, the Nereid GALATEIA
(Milk-white), aroused the love of a most improbable suitor, the Kyklops Polyphemos,
who is familiar from the Odyssey as a one-eyed ogre who captured Odysseus and ate
some of his men (see p. 492). In so far as his character was softened by the effects
of love, he is represented as being a less formidable and savage creature than in the
Homeric story, as he set out to win the favour of the sea-nymph with such untu-
tored love-songs and other modes of courtship as his not very abundant wits could
suggest. There could be no question, of course, of her yielding to her uncouth
admirer, and she was able to keep at a safe distance from him by remaining in her
own element. The story of this one-sided love affair, which is set in Sicily, can be
traced back to a lost dithyramb, the Kyklops of Philoxenus of Cythera (c. 436–380
BC), of which only a few brief fragments survive. It told how Polyphemos took up
the lyre to sing the praises of Galateia, and of how Odysseus tried to win his release
from the ogre by offering to put his ingenuity to work to help him to gain his
desire.205 This poem became very celebrated, not least because it was supposed that
the depiction of Polyphemos was intended as a satirical portrait of Dionysios I of
Syracuse. The theme, which offered scope for both pathos and comedy, proved
appealing to subsequent poets; a sample of the lovesick ogre’s singing can be found
in the eleventh Idyll of Theocritus. He is sadly aware that his single eye and squat
nose have not advanced his cause with the nymph; and yet all the same, if she would
only come up from the sea, he could offer her an abundance of milk and cheese,
and fawns and bear-cubs as pets, and a snug cave to share with him in the moun-
tain-side.206

Polyphemos has a rival in Ovid’s account, a handsome youth called ACIS, who
is a son of Faunus (a rustic Italian god comparable to Pan) by a local water-nymph,
Symaethis. One day, after addressing his customary appeals and plaints to Galateia
from a hill beside the sea, Polyphemos suddenly noticed that she was lying with
Acis behind a rock, and reverted to his former ogreish ways in his jealousy; for he
tore a huge rock out of the side of Mt Etna and hurled it at his rival, crushing him
beneath it. Galateia turned his blood into water as it trickled from under the 
rock, so creating the stream on Etna that bore his name; and she turned Acis himself
into the horned god of the stream. He retained his original features except that 
he was larger and his face was now a deep blue. This transformation story, which
reappears in a few Latin sources without any great variation, may have been devised
by Ovid himself.207
If Polyphemos was sometimes presented as having succeeded in his desire, it was simply
because Galateia seemed a suitable mother for Galates (or Galas), the eponym of the Galatians
(i.e. Celts of Gaul; the province of Galatia in Asia Minor acquired that name because 
Celtic immigrants settled there in the third century BC). The Hellenistic historian Timaeus,
who was of Sicilian birth, described Galates as a son of Polyphemos and Galateia, while a
conﬂicting story, also of Hellenistic origin, claimed that Herakles had fathered him by a
Celtic princess as he was travelling through Gaul with the cattle of Geryon.208 According
to a tale of a very similar kind, Herakles fathered Keltos, the eponym of the Celts, in Gaul
by Kelto or Keltine, daughter of Bretannos;209 eponyms of this kind and their accompa-
nying birth-stories could be invented as necessity demanded.
According to a tale from the late tradition, Nereus had an only son called NERITES who
became the special favourite of Aphrodite while she was still living in the sea (for it is
assumed here that she lived there for some time after being born from the sea-foam that
surrounded the severed genitals of Ouranos). When she set off to Olympos to join the other
gods, she wanted to take Nerites with her and offered him a pair of wings (evidently to
equip him for the journey); but he preferred to remain beneath the waves with his parents
and many sisters. Angered by the rejection, the goddess turned him into a sea-snail (ne¯rite¯s)
and bestowed the wings on Eros instead, making him her constant companion from that
time onward. There is also mention of another story in which Nerites was a favourite of
Poseidon and was transformed by Helios, who was angered for some reason by the speed at
which he drove his chariot across the waves.210
Thaumas and Elektra and their daughters Iris and the Harpies
THAUMAS, the next son of Pontos, is an obscure ﬁgure with no legends or cult;
perhaps he was another old man of the sea. His name could be interpreted as meaning
‘the wondrous’ in Greek, even if it is not necessarily of Greek origin. He married
Elektra, daughter of Okeanos, who bore him some swift-moving winged daughters,
Iris and the Harpies.211
IRIS was the goddess or spirit of the rainbow, the Greek name of which, iris,
still ﬁnds a place in modern European languages as the name for the coloured
membrane around the pupil of the eye and in words such as iridescent. Her chief
role, where she is not simply a personiﬁcation of the rainbow itself, is to act as a
messenger for the gods. Although she monopolises this role in the Iliad, Hermes
— The beginnings of things —
56

tends to displace her in later literature (see p. 158). From the classical period
onwards, she is regarded increasingly as the particular servant of Hera, as Hermes
is of Zeus; Callimachus even portrays her as crouching like a dog under the throne
of the great goddess, ready to run errands at her call at any moment.212 In works
of art, which generally depict her as winged and often in a short tunic with a herald’s
staff, she appears quite frequently in a subordinate role, acting as escort to the greater
deities (as when she conducts them to the marriage of Peleus and Thetis) or some-
times as their cupbearer. ‘Golden-winged Iris’, as Homer calls her, makes many
appearances in the Iliad, carrying messages from Zeus (or on one occasion, Hera) to
mortals or other gods, or sometimes acting on her own initiative, as when she
summons the Winds to kindle the pyre of Patroklos (see p. 48).213 She is rarely to
be found, however, in mythical narratives in the subsequent literature, making only
two interventions of any real note. In the Cypria, the ﬁrst epic in the Trojan cycle,
it was she who informed Menelaos of Helen’s abduction214 (for he was absent in
Crete at the time, see pp. 445–6); and in Argonautic myth, she was said to have
intervened to restrain the Boreads from killing her sisters, the Harpies (see p. 387).215
According to Hesiod, Zeus would send her to fetch water from the Styx if any god
should need to swear a solemn oath (see p. 49).216 Presumably because the rainbow
was regarded as a sign of approaching rain, Iris is represented here and there as the
wife of the rainy West Wind, Zephyros; according to Alcaeus at least, she bore Eros
to him.217 That she had a place in cult is asserted by a single witness, the obscure
Hellenistic author Samos of Delos, who says that she was worshipped on Hekate’s
island near Delos.218
The earliest accounts represent the HARPIES as being exactly what their name
implies in Greek, ‘Snatchers’, as female death-spirits who snatch people away causing
them to disappear suddenly and without trace. Although Hesiod says nothing about
their activities, merely observing that they keep pace with the winds, they are
mentioned on three occasions in the Odyssey as female death-spirits who snatch people
away, causing them to disappear in this mysterious fashion. In speaking of the 
long and unexplained absence of his father Odysseus, Telemachos remarks 
in that epic that he would not grieve as much if he knew that he had met with a
glorious death in battle, ‘but as it is, the Harpies have spirited him away leaving
no report behind; he has gone out of sight, out of knowledge, and has left me
nothing but anguish and tears’.219 As when the swineherd Eumaios uses compar-
able language in reference to Odysseus later in the poem,220 this is simply a manner
of speaking; but it is revealing nonetheless about the way in which the Harpies
were imagined. They appear in similar guise in a more strictly mythical context in
Penelope’s account of the strange history of the daughters of Pandareos. Having
been left as orphans after their parents were killed by the gods, the girls beneﬁted
from the favour of four great goddesses, for Aphrodite nurtured them on cheese,
honey and wine, while Hera made them lovely and wise beyond all other women,
and Artemis increased their stature and Athena taught them handicrafts; but as
Aphrodite was travelling to Olympos to ask Zeus to arrange suitable marriages for
them, the Harpies snatched them away and handed them over to the Erinyes (Furies)
as servants.221 Although no explanation is offered for this sad turn in their fortunes,
Penelope’s narrative tells us a great deal about how the Harpies were viewed in

Homer’s time, for she states initially that the girls were carried away by storm-
winds (thuellai) and then that they were snatched away by Harpuiai as if this meant
much the same. The Harpies are evidently visualized, then, as wind-spirits who can
sweep people away, an idea reﬂected in their Hesiodic names, Aello (Stormwind)
and Okypete (Swiftfoot). Later authors add a third Harpy, Kelaino (the Dark).222
They are portrayed in works of art either as winged women or as large bird-like
creatures with women’s heads resembling the Sirens (as on the famous Harpy tomb
from Xanthos in Lydia, now in the British Museum).
If the Harpies simply functioned as ‘snatchers’ who removed people from the
company of the living and disappeared with them, they could hardly acquire any
proper myths of their own; but in one story at least, they also appear as persecu-
tors of the living. For in a well-known myth associated with the voyage of the
Argonauts, they are said to have persecuted the Thracian seer-king Phineus by
swooping down to snatch his food whenever he tried to eat, and by causing even
the little that was left to reek of decay.223 This feature of their activity is mentioned
in tragedy224 and was probably portrayed in the Hesiodic Catalogue. They seem to
be pictured in a rather different way in this connection, for while they are terrible
enough as death-spirits, there is nothing disgusting about them, but the Harpies 
that plague Phineus are repellent creatures which seem to be modelled on carrion-
eating birds. They are not only hideous and ravenous, but so disgustingly ﬁlthy that
they leave an intolerable stench behind and taint any food if they come into contact
with it. For the various stories that were offered to explain why Phineus came to
be persecuted by them, and the story of how they were put to ﬂight and perhaps
even killed by two winged Argonauts, the Boreads, see pp. 386–7. This is their
only story of the kind, apart from that of their brief persecution of Aeneas’ crew in
the Aeneid (see p. 588), which was clearly invented by Vergil himself on the basis
of the Argonautic legend.225
According to the Iliad, Achilles’ immortal horses Xanthos and Balios (Chestnut and Dapple)
were conceived by the Harpy Podarge (Swiftfoot) to Zephyros, the West Wind, as she was
grazing on a meadow by the streams of Ocean, presumably in the form of a mare.226 Two
ideas seem to be at work here: a male wind-god and female wind-spirit would make excel-
lent parents for wind-swift horses, and an ancient folk-belief belief suggested that mares
could be impregnated by the wind, which is not unlike Homer’s story. The early lyric poet
Stesichorus reports that Phlogeos and Harpagos (Flame-bright and Snatcher), two horses
owned by the Dioskouroi, were further children of Podarge (and some very late sources claim
that Adrastos’ wonder-horse Areion was fathered on a Harpy by Zephyros or Poseidon,
although the older traditions were quite different, see p. 101).227
The monstrous children and descendants of Phorkys and Keto
PHORKYS, the last of the three sons of Pontos, was an old man of the sea like his
brother Nereus. He married his sister KETO (Sea-monster woman) and founded a
remarkable family of monsters,228 which in Hesiod’s account seems to have taken the
form represented in Table 3 (if two ambiguities in the text are rightly interpreted).
The ﬁrst children of Phorkys and Keto were the Graiai and Gorgons, two groups
of sisters whose myths are intertwined. The name of the GRAIAI simply means
— The beginnings of things —
58

‘old women’. After initially describing them as ‘fair-cheeked’, which would imply
that they were young and attractive, Hesiod explains their name by saying that they
were grey-haired from birth.229 There is no suggestion as yet that the sisters were
old and decrepit as is usually (though not always) the case in later accounts and
portrayals. There are two of them here, the beautifully clad Pemphredo and saffron-
robed Enyo; but a third sister, Deino or Perso, is commonly added to the group in
subsequent accounts.230 It came to be believed that they not only resembled very
old women, but that the three of them possessed only a single eye and tooth between
them, which they would pass from one to another so as to be able to see and eat.
This feature of their legend is ﬁrst reported by Pherecydes, who presumably found
it in early epic.231 Pherecydes is also the ﬁrst author to mention that Perseus visited
them setting off to fetch the head of their sister, the Gorgon Medusa; in the usual
account, he had been told that they could reveal the way to some nymphs who
would provide him with some equipment that he needed for his quest, and he forced
the Graiai to disclose this information by stealing their eye and tooth and refusing
to hand them back until they spoke (see further on pp. 239–40). Or in an excep-
tional account by Aeschylus, the Graiai acted as sentries for the Gorgons, and Perseus
hurled their single eye into Lake Tritonis in Libya to prevent them from warning
their sisters of his approach.232
The GORGONS (Gorgones or Gorgous in Greek), who were three in number,
were named Stheno, Euryale and Medusa. According to Hesiod, they lived beyond

the outer Ocean toward the night in the vicinity of the Hesperides (i.e. near the
sunset in the far west);233 or in another early epic account from the Cypria, they
lived in the midst of the Ocean on a rocky island called Sarpedon.234 It is commonly
agreed in subsequent sources that they lived in or beyond the Ocean, though not
always in the west.235 Aeschylus places them close to the Graiai, however, as we
have seen, and indicates that both sets of sisters lived in the east in a place that
was accessible by land.236 Although Hesiod does not trouble to describe the Gorgons,
they are consistently pictured as monsters of hideous aspect, so very hideous that
the mere sight of them was sufﬁcient to turn the beholder to stone. Their grinning
heads were wreathed with snakes, and they had fearsome teeth, or even tusks like
wild boars.
As Hesiod already mentions, Medusa was distinguished from her sisters by the
fact that she alone was mortal; and it was for that reason that Perseus chose her as
his victim when he was sent to fetch a Gorgon’s head (see p. 240).237 Hesiod has
occasion to refer to this episode in the Theogony because, in the oddest of ways, it
is of genealogical signiﬁcance. For Medusa was pregnant at the time of her death,
having previously slept with Poseidon in a soft meadow among spring ﬂowers, 
and her unborn children, CHRYSAOR and PEGASOS, sprang from her neck 
when Perseus cut off her head.238 The poet remarks that Chrysaor bore that name
because he held a golden sword (chryseion aor) in his hands, but reveals nothing
further about him except that he was the father of Geryoneus (see below);239

and later sources are no more informative. The visual evidence, which is also very
limited, suggests that Chrysaor was not monstrous in form like so many members
of this family. The winged horse Pegasos, by contrast, is prominent in myth as the
auxiliary of Bellerophon (see p. 434).
Although Homer makes no reference to the story of Perseus and Medusa, he does
mention that ‘the head of that terrible monster, the Gorgon, a thing of fright and
terror’ was attached to the aigis (see p. 74) of Athena;240 and it is at least possible
that it was already accepted in Homer’s time that she had acquired it from Perseus,
as is reported by later authors from Pherecydes onwards (see p. 242).241 Homer also
refers to the Gorgon’s head as an ornament on human armour; the crowning feature
of Agamemnon’s shield, for instance, is a Gorgon’s head which glares from it in a
horrifying manner, with representations of Deimos and Phobos (Terror and Fear) on
either side.242 As images that were not only fearsome to behold but might also be
credited with magical powers (i.e. for the repelling of harm), such images were
carved on breastplates and shields in historical times, and also on walls and gates.
Portrayals from early Greek art tally well with the Homeric passages, showing a
horrible grinning head with a ﬂat nose, lolling tongue and staring eyes. It seems
likely that the Gorgon’s head or gorgoneion originated as an apotropaic image, existing
independently as such before it was turned into a complete monster and thence into
a trio of monsters.
According to a strange story in Euripides’ Ion, Athena acquired her gorgoneion by killing the
Gorgon (here unnamed) during the battle between the gods and the Giants, after Gaia had
brought the monster to birth to provide a fearsome ally for the Giants (who were sons of
hers).243 This was probably a tale of fairly late origin, perhaps invented by Euripides himself;
there is no sign of it anywhere else, whether in the literary or artistic record.
To explain why Poseidon should have wished to sleep with Medusa, it was sometimes
suggested that she had been exceptionally beautiful until she came to be transformed into
the familiar monster. According to Ovid, she had been lovely in every respect and especially
for her hair until Poseidon had seduced her in a temple of Athena, greatly angering the
virgin goddess, who had transformed her hair into coils of snakes.244 Or in another story of
the kind, Athena apparently took this action after Medusa had angered her by claiming to
rival her in beauty. It is appropriate in any case that Athena should have been the deity
who transformed her since she wore Medusa’s head on her aigis.245 Irrespective of such stories,
the Gorgon’s head came to be portrayed in less monstrous form in artistic images from the
ﬁfth century BC onwards, in which she is often depicted as calmly and coldly beautiful, or,
from about 300 BC, in pathetic mode with a look of horror or pain about her eyes.
The head of Medusa, or even her hair and blood, retained an extraordinary potency after
her death. There are various tales in which Perseus is said to have made use of the Gorgon’s
head to turn his enemies to stone (see p. 242); Herakles gave a lock of her hair to Sterope,
daughter of Kepheus, to protect the Arcadian city of Tegea (see p. 547); Athena collected
some of her blood and gave it to Asklepios, who used blood from the left side of her body
to put people to death, and blood from the right side to cure people or even raise them
from the dead; or in Euripides’ Ion, Athena is said to have given Erichthonios, king of
Athens, a phial containing two drops of the Gorgon’s blood, one of which was a deadly
poison and the other a cure for disease.246 The people of Argos claimed that the Gorgon’s
head was buried under a mound in their marketplace, where it doubtless served a useful
function in averting harm.247

Chrysaor, the strangely born son of Medusa, mated with the Okeanid Kallirhoe to
father a son of his own, GERYONEUS (or Geryones, or Geryon).248 Although
Hesiod merely describes him as three-headed, later accounts and images present him
as being triple-bodied, with three upper bodies joined together at the waist, and
either one pair of legs or three. It was sometimes supposed that he was winged
also.249 He lived in the outer Ocean in the remote west on the mythical island of
Erytheia (‘the Red Island’, a suitable name for a place that lay close to the sunset);
and he owned large herds of cattle which were tended by a herdsman called Eurytion,
and guarded by the dog Orthos or Orthros (see below). When the Greeks came to
know of Iberia, they came to suppose that Erytheia lay somewhere off its coast,
sometimes identifying it with Gadeira (Cadiz, then not attached to the mainland)
or another island of the area.250 Or Geryoneus’ home was located somewhere in
Ambracia in north-western Greece according to an alternative account251 (possibly
of ancient origin if it dates back to the days when this could have been viewed as
a remote area that lay somewhere near the sunset). Geryoneus lived too far away to
be troubled by strangers until Herakles arrived to steal some of the monster’s cattle
as one of his labours; triple-bodied though he was, he proved to be no match for
that hero, who killed him before departing with his plunder (see further on p. 265).
The next child of Phorkys and Keto was ECHIDNA (‘Snake-woman’), who was
formed like a beautiful woman in the upper half of her body, and otherwise like a
terrible snake with speckled skin. The gods granted her a cave for a home, deep
under the earth in the land of the Arimoi (probably somewhere in Asia Minor, see
p. 85), where she lived far away from gods and mortals alike, feeding on raw meat.252
As might be inferred from Hesiod’s account of her, she had little occasion to appear
in mythical tales.
Apollodorus records a strange tale from the Argolid in which Argos Panoptes (see p. 230)
is said to have killed her in her sleep; she is described here as a daughter of Tartaros and 
Gaia who used to prey on passers-by.253 The Scythian Echidna or snake-woman who forced
Herakles to make love with her (see p. 267) was plainly a different creature.
By mating with Typhon, a monster no less terrible than herself, Echidna founded
a family of monstrous beasts. The three who were certainly children of her own (for
there are ambiguities in Hesiod’s text) are Orthos, Kerberos and the Lernaian
hydra.254 Orthos (or Orthros) was the watchdog of Geryoneus who was ﬁnally shot
or clubbed to death by Herakles (see p. 264). Although Hesiod says nothing about
his appearance, he was evidently no ordinary dog; in artistic images, he is quite
often shown with two heads. His brother Kerberos, the hound of Hades, is often
said to have had many more, ﬁfty in Hesiod’s account, or no less than a hundred
according to Pindar and some later authors.255 In works of art, however, for prac-
tical reasons, he is typically shown with three (or less commonly two), and many
authors from the Attic tragedians onwards describe him as three-headed accord-
ingly.256 He usually has a snake for a tail, and may have serpents springing from
other parts of his body also. The Iliad and Odyssey both allude to him, though not
by name and without a description, mentioning that Herakles once fetched him up
from the Underworld (as his penultimate or ﬁnal labour, see p. 268).257 In contrast
— The beginnings of things —
62

to the other monsters in this group, he made a valuable contribution to the ordering
of the world by ensuring that the dead remained enclosed in the Underworld (see
p. 112), and Herakles was therefore obliged to set him free afterwards to allow him
to return to his duties. The third child of Echidna and Typhon was the Lernaian
hydra, which was reared by Hera in the marshes of Lerna in the Argolid to be a
danger to Herakles.258 Although Hesiod says nothing about its appearance, it was
a huge snake (hydra simply means water-snake in Greek) which was especially
dangerous in the usual tradition because of its many heads. Herakles killed it
nonetheless as one of his labours, with a little help from his nephew Iolaos (see 
p. 258).
The next monster in the family of Echidna is the Chimaira. It is not clear from
Hesiod’s language whether she was another child of Echidna or, as is perhaps more
likely, the offspring of the hydra. She was a composite being of improbable design
who was formed like a huge lion with the head of a goat (chimaira) springing from
her back, and with a snake for a tail.259 Since her tail was tipped with a snake’s
head, she had three heads overall. She lived in Lycia in Asia Minor until she was
killed by Bellerophon (see p. 434). The dog Orthos mated with the Chimaira (or
conceivably with his mother Echidna) to produce the last two members of the family,
the Theban Phix, or Sphinx as she is more commonly known, and the Nemean
lion.260 The Sphinx was a monster of a familiar Near Eastern type with the body
of a lion, the head of a woman, and wings. She persecuted the people of Thebes
until Oedipus killed her or caused her take her own life (see further on pp. 309ff).

Figure 2.7
Bellerophon slaying the Chimaira.

The Nemean lion was raised by Hera in the Argolid to be a danger to Herakles,
who killed him as his ﬁrst labour (see p. 256). Although he was doubtless very large
and ﬁerce, his only really exceptional feature was his impenetrable hide, which is
ﬁrst mentioned by Pindar and Bacchylides.261 Echidna’s branch of the family was
thus devised to account for the origin of some well-known monstrous beasts that
were killed by Herakles and other monster-slaying heroes. In the form of some of
these monsters, we may recognize the inﬂuence of non-Greek, chieﬂy Near Eastern,
fancy on the Greek mind.
The last of the offspring of Phorkys and Keto, after Echidna, was the huge snake
that guarded the golden apples of the Hesperides (see p. 28). Although nameless in
the early tradition, it was sometimes called Ladon in Hellenistic and later times.262
In some accounts, though apparently not most, Herakles killed it when he stole
some of the apples of the Hesperides as one of his labours (see p. 272).
Phorkys is mentioned in the Odyssey as the father of another child, the nymph Thoosa who
was the mother of the Kyklops Polyphemos;263 and from the classical period onwards the
sea-monster Skylla, who presented such a danger to the Argonauts and Odysseus (see pp.
395 and 496), was usually classed as a daughter of Phorkys, whether by Hekate or a certain
Krataiis (who is named as the mother of Skylla in the Odyssey).264 According to a Hellenistic
tale, Phorkys brought Skylla back to life again after she was killed by Herakles for stealing
some of the cattle of Geryoneus; he revived her by applying burning torches to her body.265

THE RISE OF ZEUS 
AND REVOLTS AGAINST 
HIS RULE

O
ur central concern in the present chapter will be the mythology of Zeus, the
great king of the gods. As we have seen, he did not always occupy that posi-
tion, but rose to power in the third generation by displacing his father Kronos, who
had won power for himself and his fellow Titans by displacing his own father,
Ouranos (Sky). The ﬁrst part of the chapter will be devoted to an examination of
the ‘succession myth’ (see p. 33) which tells of the family conﬂicts that provoked
the fall of the previous ruling gods. Various side-issues will also be considered in
this connection, including other aspects of the mythology of Kronos and his wife
Rhea. After Zeus had established himself as the new ruler of the universe with the
help of his brothers and sisters and other allies, the Olympian order remained to be
completed. All the younger Olympian deities were fathered by Zeus himself (with
the possible exception of Hephaistos if he was born to Hera alone, see p. 79);1 and
Zeus also fathered some lesser goddesses who represented aspects of the new order.
Although Hera was commonly thought to have been his only wife, the Theogony
formalizes his principal liaisons with other goddesses by classing them as a series
of early marriages that preceded his ﬁnal union with Hera; we will consider these
liaisons and their issue in the order in which they are described in the Theogony,
before concluding with a general survey of the origins of the Olympian gods. As a
sovereign who had established his own power by revolting against the former ruling
powers, Zeus had to quell various insurrections on his own account to prevent the
cycle from being repeated. The main subject of the latter part of the chapter will
be the three great revolts that were launched against Zeus and the Olympian order
by the fearsome monster Typhon, by the earthborn race of Giants, and ﬁnally by
two gigantic brothers, the Aloadai. We will conclude by examining the conﬂict of
a rather different kind that arose between Zeus and a cousin of his, Prometheus,
who provoked his anger by championing the interests of the human race.
THE GREEK SUCCESSION MYTH
In the standard version of the succession myth, as recounted by Hesiod, the Titans
were the ﬁrst-born children of the primordial couple Gaia (Earth) and Ouranos (Sky),

who then generated two sets of monsters, the Kyklopes and the Hekatoncheires
(Hundred-Handers).2 The Titans have already been discussed in the previous chapter;
although Hesiod assigns individual names to all of them (see pp. 36–7) and draws
them into his genealogical scheme, two alone stand out from the collective body of
the Titans in the succession myth, Kronos, the second ruler of the universe, and his
wife Rhea. Before we pass on to consider how Kronos entered into conﬂict with his
father, something must be said about the monstrous children of Ouranos and Gaia,
who will have their own part to play in the succession myth.
The three KYKLOPES (Round-eyes), who were giants with a single eye in the
middle of their forehead, would help Zeus to victory in his war against the Titans
by providing him with his thunder-weapon (see p. 74). Their connection with
thunder and lightning as the manufacturers of the thunderbolt is reﬂected in the
names that Hesiod assigns to them, Brontes (Thunder-man), Steropes (Lightning-
man) and Arges (Vividly bright, an epithet applied to Zeus’s thunderbolt in early
epic).3 Since they must evidently have been skilled and powerful craftsmen, it came
to be imagined in the Hellenistic tradition that they assisted the smith-god
Hephaistos in his labours, toiling at his side in a huge forge under Mt Etna or else-
where (see p. 166).4 Although one would expect the Kyklopes to be immortal in
view of their divine birth, Apollo was sometimes said to have killed them for having
made the thunderbolt that killed his son Asklepios5 (see p. 151); or according to a
fragment from Pindar, Zeus killed them to ensure that nobody would be able to
acquire arms from them in the future.6
In an astral myth of Hellenistic origin, it was said that the Kyklopes fashioned the altar on
which Zeus and his allies swore their allegiance before making war against the Titans, and
that this altar was later transferred to the heavens, presumably by Zeus himself, to become
the constellation of the Altar (Ara) in the southern sky.7 Pausanias reports that sacriﬁces 
were offered to the Kyklopes at an ancient altar at the Isthmus of Corinth,8 but there is no
indication otherwise that they were honoured in cult.
As ancient mythographers already remark,9 these primordial Kyklopes should be disting-
uished from some mythical giants of two other kinds who were called by the same name,
the Homeric Kyklopes and the master-builders of popular lore. The Kyklopes of the Odyssey
lived a primitive pastoral life without government or law on a mythical island somewhere
in the furthermost reaches of the sea; if all were like Polyphemos, the ogre who captured
Odysseus (see p. 492), they were savage sons of Poseidon with a single eye.10 The Kyklopes
of the other race were giants of folklore who were supposed to have erected the walls of
Mycenae and Tiryns (see pp. 237 and 243) and other Mycenaean structures whose ‘Cyclopean’
masonry seemed to lie beyond the capacity of ordinary human workmanship.11 They may
be compared with the giants of modern folklore who are credited with the erection of mega-
liths or are said to have thrown down massive stones of that kind while playing at quoits.
The second group of monstrous sons of Ouranos and Gaia consisted of three gigantic
beings who each had ﬁfty heads and a hundred arms; although Hesiod refers to
them by their individual names alone, Kottos, Briareos and Gyges, mythographers
in later times devised a convenient name for them, calling them the HEKATON-
CHEIRES or HUNDRED-HANDERS12 (the corresponding adjective is already
applied to Briareos in the Iliad13). As hundred-handed giants of irresistible strength,
— The rise of Zeus and revolts against his rule —
66

they would be invaluable allies for Zeus in the struggle against the Titans. Since
they were sent down to Tartaros afterwards to act as guards to the defeated Titans,
they make no further appearance in myth, at least as a group.
One of the brothers, BRIAREOS (the Mighty One, also called Ombriareos), has indepen-
dent stories nonetheless which are set during the period of Olympian rule. He is marked
out from his brothers even in the Theogony, for it is stated there that Poseidon made him
his son-in-law at some point after the fall of the Titans by offering him his daughter
Kymopoleia (Wave-walker, otherwise unknown) as a wife.14 The Iliad reports that he was
once summoned to Olympos by Thetis to save Zeus from a threatened revolt by Hera,
Poseidon and Athena15 (see p. 82); since Thetis was a sea-nymph, this would suggest that
he lived in the sea, as might also be inferred from his relationship with Poseidon in the
Theogony. Homer also remarks that he was called Briareos by the gods but was known to
mortals as Aigaion.16 In the Titanomachy, an early epic now lost, Aigaion was apparently
described as a son of Gaia and Pontos (Sea) who lived in the sea and fought as an ally of
the Titans.17 If this Aigaion can be identiﬁed with Briareos, as seems likely, this account
of him clearly differed in crucial respects from that in the Theogony. A Corinthian tradition
suggested that Briareos had acted as arbitrator when Helios and Poseidon had competed for
possession of the land in early times (see p. 103).18 He was honoured in cult on Euboea
under two different names, as Briareos at Karystos and as Aigaion at Chalkis.19 All in all,
he is a most intriguing ﬁgure, and one would like to know more of him than can be gathered
from these surviving scraps.
Trouble soon arose within the newly generated family of Ouranos because he hated
his offspring and prevented them from coming to the light. Although Hesiod is
vague about the cause of his hatred, it would seem that he took a dislike to them
because they were terrible to behold, especially the monsters who were born ﬁrst of
all. He hid them deep away inside the earth as each was born, apparently blocking
their emergence by engaging in ceaseless intercourse with his consort (although
Hesiod is vague on this matter too); and he took delight in his wicked works. Gaia
groaned under the strain and thought up a crafty plan. After ﬁrst creating adamant
(a mythical metal of extreme hardness), she used it to make a large jagged sickle,
and then tried to persuade her children to take action against their father. All were
frightened to respond except for Kronos, the youngest and most terrible of the
Titans, who took the sickle from his mother and waited in ambush for his father
in accordance with her instructions. As Ouranos was engaging in intercourse with
his wife at nightfall, Kronos cut off his genitals with the sickle and cast them into
the sea. Aphrodite, the goddess of love, sprang up from the foam that gathered
around them in the waters (see p. 194); and three other groups of children, the
Giants, Meliai and Erinyes, sprang up from the earth after it was fertilised by drops
of blood that fell from them (see p. 38). The Titans were now able to emerge into
the light, and to assume power as the lords of the universe under the sovereignty
of Kronos. It would seem, however, that in Hesiod’s version (unlike that of
Apollodorus, see below) the Kyklopes and Hundred-Handers remained imprisoned
beneath the earth until they were later rescued by Zeus.20
After his rise to power, Kronos married his sister Rhea, who bore him six splendid
children, Hestia, Demeter, Hera, Hades, Poseidon and Zeus; but since he was warned

by his parents that he was destined to be overpowered by his own son, he swal-
lowed each of his children at birth, causing endless grief to his wife.21 When Zeus
was due to be born, Rhea ﬁnally consulted Ouranos and Gaia on her own account,
asking them to devise a plan to enable her to save her forthcoming child and bring
retribution on Kronos. On their advice, she secretly entrusted the new-born Zeus
to Gaia in Crete (see further on pp. 74–5) and gave Kronos a large stone wrapped
in swaddling-clothes, which he swallowed in the usual manner in place of his child.22
Hesiod offers little detail on what happened next, merely stating that Zeus grew
up quickly in his Cretan hiding-place, and then forced Kronos to vomit up his chil-
dren in accordance with a plan that was suggested to his mother by Gaia. After
ﬁrst spewing up the stone, which Zeus installed at Delphi to be a sign and wonder
to mortals (see p. 145), Kronos vomited up the ﬁve brothers and sisters of Zeus in
the reverse order to that in which he had swallowed them. Zeus also released the
Kyklopes, who had apparently remained imprisoned beneath the earth since they
had been conﬁned there by their father Ouranos; and they showed their gratitude
by arming Zeus with his all-powerful weapon, the thunderbolt.23
Zeus now joined together with his brothers and sisters to wrest control of the
universe from Kronos and the Titans, confronting them in the greatest war ever
fought, the Titanomachy (Titanomachia). The Titans chose Mt Othrys in southern
Thessaly as their stronghold, while Zeus and his allies fought from Mt Olympos on
the northern borders of the province. The battle raged on for ten long years without
either side gaining a clear advantage, until Gaia revealed to Zeus and the Olympians
that they would be victorious if they recruited the Hundred-Handers as their 
allies. So Zeus released the monsters from their conﬁnement (for they had remained
imprisoned beneath the earth like the Kyklopes), and revived their strength and
spirits with nectar and ambrosia. They were then quite happy to respond to Zeus’s
appeal for help. The struggle now reached its decisive phase as Zeus unleashed his
full fury against the Titans, dazing them with his thunderbolts, while the Hundred-
Handers pelted them with huge rocks in successive salvoes. The entire universe
resounded to the battle, from the high heavens to murky Tartaros. Kronos and the
Titans were ﬁnally overpowered by the many-handed monsters, who hurled them
down to Tartaros to be imprisoned there for evermore. To ensure that they would
be securely detained, Zeus appointed the Hundred-Handers as their warders. After
their hard-won victory, Zeus and the younger gods assumed power as the new rulers
of the universe in the third generation.24
Such is the standard account of the succession myth as provided by Hesiod; Apollodorus
offers an account of uncertain origin (perhaps derived from the lost Titanomachia, or from
the Orphic literature) which differs from the Hesiodic version in some important respects.
The Hundred-Handers and Kyklopes are born before the Titans in this account, and are
hurled down to Tartaros by their father while the Titans are apparently left unharmed.
Distressed by the loss of her children who had been cast below, Gaia incited the Titans to
attack their father, giving an adamantine sickle to Kronos; and all of them took part in the
assault with the sole exception of Okeanos (see p. 37 for the signiﬁcance of this). Kronos
struck the decisive blow, however, as in Hesiod’s version, by severing the genitals of Ouranos.
After the dethronement of Ouranos, the Titans rescued their brothers from Tartaros and
entrusted the sovereignty to Kronos. But Kronos imprisoned the two sets of monsters once
— The rise of Zeus and revolts against his rule —
68

again, and then swallowed his own children with the exception of Zeus, as in the usual
story. When Zeus came of age, he sought the help of Metis (the personiﬁcation of cunning
wisdom, see p. 77), who tricked Kronos into swallowing an emetic drug to force him to
disgorge his swallowed children. With the aid of his brothers and sisters, Zeus fought against
Kronos and the Titans for ten years, but was unable to defeat them until Gaia prophesied
that he would be able to do so if he enlisted the help of the monsters who had been banished
to Tartaros by Kronos. So he killed their warder, a certain Kampe, and set them free. The
Kyklopes armed him with his thunderbolt as usual, and also gave Poseidon his trident and
provided Hades with a cap of invisibility. With the aid of these devices, and presumably
the assistance of the Hundred-Handers too, Zeus and his allies now defeated the Titans and
imprisoned them in Tartaros with the Hundred-Handers as their guards.25
Fitting though it may be that Kronos and the Titans, as a race of ‘former gods’, should
be banished from the upper world forever, this is not always the case in post-Hesiodic
accounts. Pindar states explicitly, for instance, in one of his odes, that the Titans were even-
tually released by Zeus; and in the Prometheus Unbound, a lost Aeschylean play, they appeared
on the stage as the chorus along with Prometheus after he was released from Tartaros (see
p. 96), which would imply that they had been set free by Zeus.26 As has already been
remarked, some individuals who are named as Titans in Hesiod’s list could not have been
removed from the upper world at this early stage in any case. Okeanos could not have
deserted his streams (see p. 37), nor Tethys perhaps the sea; Themis and Mnemosyne are
said to have engaged in liaisons with Zeus even in the Theogony, and they were permanent
forces in the world as the personiﬁcations of memory and right order; and Kronos and Rhea
were themselves thought to be active in the world in so far as they were honoured in cult.
THE FURTHER MYTHOLOGY OF KRONOS 
AND RHEA
Greek legend offers contrasting visions of KRONOS and his regime. If the succes-
sion myth presents him as a brutal tyrant who swallowed his own children, another
tradition also to be found in Hesiod presents his reign as a time of innocent happi-
ness when mortals lived long and virtuous lives under his benevolent rule. In this
view, his mortal subjects lived lives of blissful ease, much like the inhabitants of
the Isles of the Blessed (see p. 116), without toil or strife or need of law, owning
all things in common and enjoying abundant fruits and crops that were brought
forth by the earth of its own accord; and when they ﬁnally died, it was as though
they were overcome by a gentle sleep. In short, it was the Golden Age,  π Kρν

ς, Saturnia regna.27 This peasant’s daydream of a lost age of happiness was
evidently rooted in folklore; and it is by no means difﬁcult to understand why it
came to be identiﬁed with the age of Kronos. Since everything in that age was quite
the opposite of what could be witnessed in the harsh present under the rule of Zeus,
it could be concluded that this must be an account of the conditions that had
prevailed under the rule of Kronos, not because he was presented as being in any
way benevolent in myth, but simply because he had presided over the previous
divine order before things came to be as they now are.
In the celebrated myth of progressive decline in Hesiod’s Works and Days,28 these
fortunate people who lived under the rule of Kronos are presented as being the ﬁrst
of ﬁve successive races, four of which are named after metals of decreasing value,

namely gold, silver, bronze and iron. We belong to the ﬁfth and worst race, that
of iron. The gods created a golden race of mortals ﬁrst of all, who lived an ideal
life under Kronos in accordance with the usual legend; and when these ﬁrst people
came to die, as though falling asleep, without ever having suffered the ravages of
age, they became beneﬁcent spirits (daimones) who roam the earth delivering mortals
from harm and watching over their deeds. The gods replaced them with a silver
race which was inferior in both body and mind. The people of this race took a
hundred years to reach maturity, remaining all the while at their mother’s side, but
lived only a brief and wretched life when they ﬁnally grew up, for they were foolish
beings who were unable to refrain from wrongdoing and violence and failed to
honour the immortal gods. Their impiety aroused the anger of Zeus, who eventu-
ally removed them from the earth to become blessed spirits in the Underworld.29
Zeus then brought a bronze race into being, consisting of people who sprang from
ash-trees (meliai, which might also be interpreted as meaning ash-tree nymphs).
Their armour, their weapons and even their houses were made of bronze. Powerful,
aggressive and ﬂinty-hearted, they devoted themselves to war and slaughter until
they were all destroyed as a result of their own violence, and passed to the dank
house of Hades leaving no name behind.30
Before passing on to the last of his ‘metallic’ races, to which he himself belongs,
Hesiod interposes the ‘god-like race of heroes’ who fought with honour in the Theban
and Trojan Wars, and showed themselves to be nobler and juster than their prede-
cessors in the bronze race; since it was agreed that the great heroes of epic lived
just before the beginning of ordinary human history, the poet evidently felt obliged
to include them at this point and so interrupt his scheme of decline. Hesiod’s text
is ambiguous on the matter of their ultimate fate, failing to make clear whether all
were transferred to the Isles of the Blessed, or else only a portion of them while
others were consigned to Hades.31 As to the present age, Hesiod regrets that he was
ever born into it, for the people of the race of iron have no respite from toil and
sorrow by day, or from wasting away and perishing by night. Although not wholly
bad, they will grow progressively worse until Zeus destroys them in their turn.32
It should be noted that Hesiod does not refer to golden and other ages, even if
modern authors often ﬁnd it convenient to use these terms when referring to his
myth; the ‘golden age’ is an expression of Latin origin (from saeculum aureum, an
ambiguous phrase which can mean both golden race and golden age).
Although Kronos was not much honoured in cult, he had a most interesting
festival, the Kronia, which was celebrated at Athens and other Ionian cities in partic-
ular, and also at Thebes in conjunction with a musical contest. On the day of the
festival, the normal social distinctions were overturned, and slaves would be feasted
by their masters and allowed to rampage through the town creating as much noise
as they wished. This could be regarded as a temporary return to the life without
toil or subordination that had prevailed during the reign of Kronos. Although the
Kronia has often been viewed as a harvest-festival, this is now disputed. It was cele-
brated well after harvest-time at Athens (though not all places), in the month of
Hekatombeion, which is said to have been known as Kronion in early times; and
Kronos’ customary attribute of the sickle does not necessarily have agricultural
connotations, for it is associated with him in connection with his attack on his father
— The rise of Zeus and revolts against his rule —
70

in the succession myth, and sickles are used for similar purposes by other mythical
ﬁgures who have nothing to do with agriculture (e.g. by Perseus against the Gorgon,
p. 240, or by Herakles against the Hydra, p. 258). The rare representations of 
Kronos in art show him as a majestic but sorrowful old man holding a sickle. The
Greeks frequently identiﬁed him with unlovely foreign deities such as Moloch, 
a Semitic god who was offered human sacriﬁces. The Romans identiﬁed him 
with Saturn (Saturnus or Saeturnus), an old Italian deity whose functions are obscure;
Saturn’s annual festival of the Saturnalia, at which slaves were granted exceptional
liberties, resembled the Kronia in some notable respects, as was recognized in ancient
times.
Later authors have a fair amount to say about Kronos after his defeat. Evidently because
conditions on the Isles of the Blessed (see pp. 114ff) resembled those that were supposed to
have prevailed under the rule of Kronos, some authors make him the lord of those islands; 
Pindar already presents him in this role, with Rhadamanthys as his assistant (paredros).33
Some verses that purport to come from Hesiod’s Works and Days, but are almost certainly
a later interpolation, explain that Zeus released him from his banishment to enable him to
assume this function.34 Plutarch records a picturesque tale in which he sleeps forever in an
island beyond Britain (i.e. at the extremities of the known world) with many followers around
him and Briareos as his guard.35 In rationalistic accounts of a Euhemeristic nature which
represent Kronos and Zeus as early kings, Kronos is often said to have sought refuge in Italy
after he was deposed, hiding from Zeus in Latium, hence its name (as though it were derived
from the Latin word latere, to hide). Vergil alludes to this tradition in the Aeneid, saying
that Saturnus (i.e. Kronos) had ruled at the future site of Rome during his exile, where he
had uniﬁed the local people and ushered in a golden age.36
RHEA or RHEIA, the consort of Kronos, is a grandiose but somewhat vague ﬁgure
who had little place in Greek cult (except in so far as she came to be identiﬁed
with Kybele, see below). She was honoured to some extent, however, in conjunc-
tion with her husband, as at Athens, where she shared a temple with him in the
precinct of Olympian Zeus, and at Olympia, where one of the six altars of the
Twelve Gods (see p. 81) was dedicated to the two of them;37 and she had a sacred
cave on Mt Thaumasion in Arcadia which was closed to everyone except her own
priestess.38 Since it was commonly believed that Zeus was born in Crete, it is under-
standable that this should sometimes have been regarded as Rhea’s home in the
later tradition;39 but there is no early evidence to suggest that she was actually a
goddess of Cretan origin. As the mother of the gods (i.e. of the Olympian gods of
the ﬁrst generation), Rhea could easily be identiﬁed with that very old and widely
worshipped power, the Mother, who was honoured under all manner of names in
Greece, the Aegean islands and the Asian mainland, sometimes in conjunction with
a male partner, sometimes alone. Although deeply rooted in the native tradition,
the Greek cult of the Great Mother (Meter) came to be strongly inﬂuenced by the
cult of the Phrygian mother-goddess Kybele, which entered the Greek world from
Asia Minor. The Great Mother was identiﬁed with both Rhea and Demeter; and
Rhea was often equated with Kybele, whose cult ﬁnally spread through much of
the Roman Empire. This had implications for myth, above all because the Cretan
Kouretes, who were associated with Rhea in connection with the rearing of Zeus

(see below), came to be confused or equated with the Korybantes, attendants of
Kybele in Asia Minor (see p. 219).
Much of the mythology of Rhea, orthodox and unorthodox alike, has to do with
her relationship with Kronos and her rescue of the new-born Zeus. Since there were
legends that claimed that Zeus was born and reared in other places apart from Crete,
local versions of the latter story take Rhea to many corners of the Greek world 
(especially in the Peloponnese, see p. 76 for examples) and of Asia Minor. For 
an Arcadian legend of a comparable nature in which she is said to have hidden the 
new-born Poseidon in Arcadia, giving Kronos a foal to swallow in place of him, see
— The rise of Zeus and revolts against his rule —

p. 102. In the Homeric Hymn to Demeter, Zeus sends Rhea as his envoy when he wants
to inform Demeter of his decision with regard to the fate of Persephone;40 and in
one quite early version of the story of the slaughter and revival of Pelops (see 
p. 503), it is Rhea who restores him to life again after he has been served as a meal
to the gods.41
Rhea was not the only mate of Kronos, even if she alone is regarded as his wife,
for an old tradition claimed that he fathered the Centaur Cheiron by an Okeanid
nymph called PHILYRA. To account for the semi-equine nature of their offspring,
it is explained in one version of the story that Kronos turned himself into a stal-
lion to mate with her after she tried to escape from him by turning into a mare.42
Or in the version recorded by Apollonius, he was caught in ﬂagrante by Rhea as he
was having intercourse with Philyra on an island of the same name in the Black
Sea, and leapt up in the form of a horse (presumably by way of disguise), while
Philyra ﬂed the area in shame to settle in Thessaly, the traditional homeland of
Cheiron.43 Or according to Hyginus, Kronos had intercourse with Philyra in the
form of a stallion while he was roaming the world in search of the infant Zeus, and
Philyra was so shocked by the hybrid appearance of her child that she prayed to
Zeus to be transformed, and was turned into a lime-tree (philyra in Greek).44 This
extra transformation was evidently a late fancy inspired by the etymology. Though
already called Philyrides at the end of the Theogony, Cheiron is ﬁrst described as a
son of Kronos and Philyra in Pindar’s odes.45 In accordance with his divine origin,
he was a wise and noble being, in marked contrast to most of the Centaurs (who
were of very different birth, see p. 554).
ZEUS AND HIS EARLIER LIFE
To attempt anything more than the briefest of sketches of Zeus is obviously impos-
sible. Many Indo-European peoples have a divine ﬁgure who more or less corresponds
to him, such as Dyaus in India, Iuppiter (i.e. Dyaus pita, the addition meaning
‘father’) in Italy, or Tiwaz among the Germanic peoples. The root meaning of his
name is apparently ‘bright’, and he is the god of the sky, or rather of the phenomena
of the sky or, more accurately, those of the atmosphere. His primary functions 
appear to be connected with rain and the return of ﬁne weather, and also, very char-
acteristically, with thunder and lightning. Hence he is associated also with what
depends so largely upon the weather, the fertility of the soil, although this is never
a very prominent aspect of his cult or nature. To all this a long string of titles 
bear witness, such as Ombrios and Hyettios (Rainer), Ourios (Sender of favour-
able winds), Astrapaios (Sender of lightning), Bronton (Thunderer), Epikarpios
(Producer of fruits), Georgos (Farmer), and so forth. But he is so widely worshipped
that there is hardly a department of nature or of human activity with which he is
not connected in some way. He is the protector of the household and social order,
and all sovereignty and law proceeds from him; he is represented as having moral
concerns from an early period, particularly as a guardian of suppliants and strangers
and an overseer of oaths and justice. From the time of Homer onwards, he was so
ﬁrmly established as the supreme god that we feel no surprise at ﬁnding his name

used by thinkers of a monotheistic tendency as practically equivalent to ‘God’.
Although his myths include many that are early and grotesque, or late and frivo-
lous, he never quite loses his majesty, and is consistently represented in art as a
stately ﬁgure, a vigorous man in the prime of life, standing or sitting in a digni-
ﬁed attitude, usually draped from the waist down, bearing a sceptre or thunderbolt,
or both, and attended by his familiar, the eagle.
Zeus is often represented, in art and literature alike, as associated with the oak, a tree marked
out as appropriate not only by its beauty and majesty and its long life, but also by two con-
spicuous facts, namely that it grew very widely in ancient Greece and is struck very frequently
by lightning (as the ancients noticed and modern forestry has proved statistically).
Two important attributes of Zeus are the thunderbolt and aigis. Of the former it need 
only be said that before the true character of electrical phenomena came to be understood, the
destructive power of lightning encouraged the thought that some heavy and pointed missile
came down from the sky with the lightning-ﬂash; and what could be more natural than to
assume that it was the special weapon of the sky-god? In Greek art, Zeus’ thunderbolt was
shown as a biconical object, often having conventionalized lightning-ﬂashes attached, and
sometimes wings also. It was fashioned for him, as we have seen, by the Kyklopes.
The aigis (or aegis in Latin form) is described, by various authors from Homer onwards,
as a fringed garment or piece of armour that could be worn as a corselet or serve as a sort
of shield; as worn or held by a god, it was not only a potent defence, but a magically
powerful weapon that would inspire terror in an enemy if it were held out in the hand and
shaken. Aigiochos, the Aigis-bearer, is a regular title of Zeus. According to the Iliad,
Hephaistos gave it to him as a fearsome object that would cause terror in men, and it was
bright to behold and shaggy-fringed, with a hundred golden tassels;46 although Zeus shakes
it at one point to induce panic in the Greeks, and it is suggested that he will shake it over
Troy on the day that the city falls,47 it is used more often by his favourite daughter Athena
(and also by Apollo on two occasions).48 In the subsequent tradition it is primarily an
attribute of Athena, who can often be seen wearing it in vase-paintings. It is frequently
fringed with snake-heads in such images. According to a Hesiodic fragment, it was fash-
ioned by Metis for Athena.49 As something that was worn or wielded by the god of thunder,
it was once argued that it can be interpreted as a thunder-cloud, but the plain meaning of
the word puts this out of court; aigis simply means a goat-skin, just as nebris means a fawn-
skin. In its origin, this mysterious object is nothing more than a goat’s hide with the hair
on, forming a fringe. Just such a garment has been worn into modern times by Greek peas-
ants, and it doubtless clothed many ancient wooden or stone cult-objects representing Zeus,
for the clothing of statues was quite common in Greece. As it was of rough hide, it would
serve its wearer as a defence, not only against the weather but also against an enemy’s blow;
and a divine aegis as worn or brandished by an immensely powerful deity might be imag-
ined as a formidable protection and awe-inspiring object.
Something has already been said about the circumstances of Zeus’ birth in connec-
tion with the succession myth (see p. 68), in which Rhea hid him away in Crete
to save him from being swallowed by Kronos and tricked her husband by giving
him a stone to swallow instead. According to Hesiod, she went to the Cretan town
of Lyktos (to the west of Knossos) when she was due to give birth to Zeus, and
entrusted him to her mother Gaia to nourish and rear; so Gaia hid him away deep
inside herself in a remote cave on Mt Aigaion (otherwise unknown, but presumably
to be identiﬁed with one of the various mountains near Lyktos that contain Minoan
— The rise of Zeus and revolts against his rule —
74

holy caves).50 This account is peculiar to the Theogony, for in the subsequent tradi-
tion the cave is either located in Mt Ida in the centre of Crete or, less commonly,
on Mt Dikte to the east.51
Zeus was reared during his infancy by a local nymph or nymphs. In what was
perhaps the most favoured tradition, he was tended by the nymph Amaltheia, who
fed him on milk from a she-goat that she owned;52 or in another version which ﬁrst
appears in Callimachus, Amaltheia was the name of the goat itself, and the nymph
Adrasteia fed Zeus on its milk along with sweet honeycomb; or else his nurses were
Adrasteia and Ida, or the Idaian nymphs Helike and Kynosura, or others of their
kind.53 There were also various picturesque tales in which he was said to have been
fed by bees or suckled by a sow or the like.54 To prevent Kronos from being able
to hear the infant’s cries, some minor Cretan divinities, the Kouretes (see p. 219),
danced a noisy war-dance near the entrance to the cave, clashing their spears against
their shields.55 Or in a slightly different account, Amaltheia hung the infant in a
cradle from a tree so that he could be found neither in heaven nor on earth nor in
the sea, and the Kouretes danced around the tree.56 Much of this is connected 
with ritual, and Cretan ritual at that; excavations have shown that a fair number of
cave-sanctuaries in Crete were very ancient holy places dating back to the Minoan
period; the dances of the Kouretes can be related to similar dances performed by
Cretan youths in initiation rituals and the like (see p. 219); and it seems that a
divine child who was born (and probably died) every year was a prominent object
of Cretan worship.
A curious tale about Zeus’ cave in Crete is recorded by Antoninus Liberalis in his anthology
of transformation myths. The cave (of unspeciﬁed location) was inhabited by sacred bees 
that had tended the infant Zeus, but was otherwise forbidden ground to gods and mortals
alike. At one time four thieves had entered the cave nonetheless to steal some of the honey,
wearing full armour (to protect themselves against the bees, and probably on account of its
apotropaic value also). When they saw the swaddling-clothes of Zeus, however, and the 
blood that had been shed at his birth, their armour fractured and fell from their bodies; and
Zeus would have killed them with a thunderbolt as punishment for their sacrilege if the
Moirai (Fates) and Themis (as guardian of divine law) had not restrained him by reminding
him that no one could be allowed to die in a place of such sanctity. So he transformed 
them into various birds that bore the same names as themselves (Laios, Kerkeos, Kerberos
and Aigolios). The author remarks that the blood inside the cave used to boil up at a partic-
ular time every year, presumably on the anniversary of Zeus’ birth, causing a mass of ﬂame
to issue from the cave.57
The astronomical literature also provides some odd tales about Zeus’s childhood. In one
such story, the nanny-goat that nursed the infant Zeus is said to have been a wondrous child
of the sun-god Helios that so alarmed the Titans, apparently because of its radiant bright-
ness, that they asked Earth to conceal it from their view in one of her caves in Crete. When
Zeus came of age and was preparing for his war against the Titans, he learned that he would
be victorious if he used the hide of the goat as a shield (i.e. as his aigis); and after he duly
won his victory, he covered the bones of the goat with another skin, revived it and made
it immortal, and placed it in the heavens as Capella (the Goat), a bright star in the constel-
lation of the Charioteer (Auriga).58 Or in another tale of the kind, Kronos set off in search
of Zeus and arrived in Crete, but was deceived by his son, who concealed his presence by
transforming himself into a snake and his two nurses into bears. Zeus later commemorated

the incident by placing images of the three animals in the sky as the constellations of the
Dragon and the Greater and Lesser Bear (Draco and Ursa Major and Minor).59 Some said
that he was removed to the island of Naxos when his father came in search of him, and was
raised there from that time onwards.60
There were also numerous local traditions in which Zeus was said to have been reared 
in mainland Greece (especially the Peloponnese) or Asia Minor. According to Arcadian
tradition, for instance, Rhea brought him to birth on Mt Lykaion (an important centre for
his cult, see p. 538), and three local nymphs, Neda, Theisoa and Hagno, reared him on 
an area of the mountain that was known as Kretea. Neda was the nymph of the river Neda
that rose on Lykaion and ﬂowed westwards into Messenia; it was claimed that Earth had
caused it to spring forth at the request of Rhea to enable her to wash the new-born Zeus.
And the other two nymphs were eponyms of springs on the mountain.61 The Messenians
claim for their part that the Kouretes had conveyed the infant Zeus to their own territory,
where he had been reared by Neda and Ithome (the eponym of the Messenian mountain of
that name). In reporting this Messenian tale, Pausanias remarks that it would be impossible,
even if one should wish it, to number all the peoples who insisted that Zeus had been born
and reared in their land.62
When Zeus came of age, he returned to confront Kronos and the Titans as recounted
above. After the defeat of the Titans, he had two important affairs to settle, to divide
the conquered universe between himself and his brothers, and to provide himself
with a consort; and he was subsequently obliged to quell various revolts against the
new divine order.
According to a familiar tale which is recounted by Homer but not by Hesiod,
the ﬁrst of these matters was brieﬂy and amicably arranged: Zeus, Poseidon, and
Hades, the three male children of Kronos, cast lots for the three main divisions of
the ancestral estate, the sky, the sea and the Underworld, agreeing to hold the earth
and high Olympos in common. As the outcome of the lot, Zeus won the broad sky,
and Poseidon the grey sea to be his home forever, and Hades the murky nether
regions.63 After descending to his infernal realm, Hades lived a life apart and had
little contact with the Olympian gods.
THE BRIDES OF ZEUS AND THE ORIGINS OF 
THE OLYMPIAN GODS
In Hesiod’s account at least, the marital affairs of Zeus were a much more complicated
matter; for although Hera is the only goddess with whom Zeus could be said to have
had a marital relationship in any proper sense, Hesiod presents his main liaisons 
with other goddesses as a series of previous marriages. As everyone knows, Zeus was
a prodigiously amorous god who was associated with a great many other women, mor-
tal and divine, and was credited with a multitude of children. In a richly humorous
passage in the Iliad,64 he recites a list of his conquests to his wife as he is about to
make love with her, saying that he never felt such desire for any of them as he feels
for her at present, not even for the wife of Ixion, or for Danae, Europa, Semele or
Alkmene, or – among goddesses – Demeter or Leto (and he could have cited many
more). There were of course good reasons, religious and mythological, why he should
have come to be credited with many mistresses and children. With regard to his
— The rise of Zeus and revolts against his rule —
76

divine children, for instance, he was thought to be the only suitable father for great
Olympian deities who were not his brothers or sisters; and lesser deities too who
contributed to the divine order in some way could be ﬁttingly regarded as his
children. Or with regard to his love affairs with goddesses, he evidently came to be
linked to some at least for cultic and religious reasons. Since he was the male sky-
god, for example, it is understandable that he should have been paired with earth-
goddesses like Demeter and Semele (who was originally a Thracian goddess of this
kind, even if she was later classed as a mortal heroine, see p. 170). But once he was
paired with several such goddesses in the legends of different areas, or linked to a vari-
ety of goddesses as the father of different children, problems arose as soon as attempts
were made to correlate all the various legends (and such attempts were clearly made
very early). He must either be represented as polygynous, or be supposed to have been
gravely unfaithful to his legitimate queen. The former solution was impossible, for
the Greeks themselves were always monogamous and naturally represented their 
gods as following the same practice; the latter was more in accordance with their own
ideas, which tolerated such irregularities and gave children arising from them a rec-
ognized though subordinate place in the family. It was thus accepted that Zeus had
a single wife, Hera, but fathered many illegitimate children, who, with certain
exceptions, would acquire divine status if their mothers were goddesses, or be mortal
if they were born to mortal mothers. In the Theogony, however, his main divine
mistresses are presented as six wives whom he had taken before his ﬁnal and deﬁnitive
marriage to Hera; and even though this scheme seems to have left little mark on the
subsequent tradition, it will be convenient to consider the various unions in the order
in which they are presented in that poem.
Zeus took the Okeanid Metis, the personiﬁcation of cunning wisdom, as his ﬁrst
wife, but this was a dangerous union because she was fated to bear two exceptional
children, ﬁrst a daughter, Athena, who would be almost as wise and strong as her
father, and then a son who would displace him as ruler of gods and mortals. On
being alerted of this peril by Gaia and Ouranos, he swallowed Metis in accordance
with their advice while she was pregnant with the ﬁrst child. So Athena was born
in due time from his own body, emerging from his head (see further on p. 181),
and the threatening son was never conceived.65 Or in a rather different version from
another poem in the Hesiodic corpus (possibly the Melampodeia), Zeus was so angry
when Hera brought Hephaistos to birth as a fatherless child (see p. 79) that he set
out to perform an equivalent action, and succeeded in some sense at least by having
intercourse with Metis and then swallowing her so as to bring their child to birth
from within himself.66
The various elements in this myth can be disentangled without any great difﬁculty. The
savage motif of the swallowing was evidently recycled from the succession myth. Knowing
that he was in danger of being displaced by one of his children (just as he had displaced
his own father), Kronos swallowed his children at birth, but was foiled because Zeus was
saved from being swallowed; since the cycle of displacement came to an end with Zeus,
what could be more natural than to imagine a story in which Zeus came to know likewise
that a son of his would displace him, but removed the danger by a similar ruse to that
attempted by his father? In this case, of course, he swallows the prospective mother of the
child rather than the child itself. In the second place, the swallowing of Metis can be seen

— The rise of Zeus and revolts against his rule —

as a sort of allegory; for by ingesting her, Zeus takes possession of the cunning wisdom that
she represents, as is ﬁtting for the chief god. In all probability, the story of the birth of
Athena from the head of Zeus originated in very ancient times as an independent myth; but
it could be drawn into the present story with good effect. For Athena bears an obvious
afﬁnity to Metis as a goddess who is noted for her practical wisdom (metis) and presides over
all manner of crafts; and if it is assumed that Metis was pregnant with this appropriate 
child at the time when she was swallowed, it can be explained how Zeus himself came to
be ‘pregnant’ with Athena.
After swallowing his ﬁrst wife, Zeus married the Titan Themis, who represents
another aspect of his rule as the personiﬁcation of law and right order. She bore
him two sets of children who contributed in their different ways to the ordering of
the world, the Horai (Seasons, see further on p. 208), and the Moirai or Fates, whom
we have encountered already as daughters of Night along with other sinister powers
(see p. 27), but are now reclassiﬁed in so far as they apportion good and ill to
mortals in accordance with the authority of Zeus.67
A fragment from Pindar describes Themis as the ﬁrst wife of Zeus, saying that she was
brought up to Olympos by the Moirai to become his bride and bore the Horai to him; 
the Moirai are clearly not children of hers in this account.68 She is usually presented as an
associate of Zeus rather than a consort, an adviser who warns him not to court Thetis (see
p. 52) and helps him to plot the outbreak of the Trojan War in an early epic account; in
one of the later Homeric Hymns, she sits beside him as his conﬁdante, leaning toward him
to listen to his words of wisdom.69 She is gifted with prophetic powers like her mother
Gaia, whom she is sometimes said to have succeeded as presiding deity at Delphi before the
arrival of Apollo.70 The Homeric epics credit her with a special role as a goddess who presides
over the gatherings of gods and mortals.71
Zeus’ third wife, Eurynome, was an Okeanid like his ﬁrst; she bore him a single
set of daughters, the Charites or Graces (see further on p. 208).72 Rather more
important was his next union with the corn-goddess Demeter, which led to the
birth of Kore (the Maiden), otherwise known as Persephone (see pp. 125ff).73 His
next consort after Demeter was the Titan Mnemosyne, the personiﬁcation of
Memory, who bore him a set of nine daughters, the Muses, who will be considered
in Chapter 6 (see pp. 204ff).74 Since the Muses were originally goddesses of music
and poetry above all, Mnemosyne was an obvious mother for them, not only because
poetry preserves the memory of the past but also because the poet himself had to
place special reliance on memory before the invention of writing. The sixth and last
of these preliminary wives of Zeus was his cousin Leto, a daughter of the Titans
Koios and Phoibe. She bore two great Olympian gods to him, Artemis and Apollo.75
Since most subsequent accounts of their birth present their mother as a victim of
the jealousy of Hera (see p. 188), it was more commonly assumed that Zeus was
already married to Hera at the time of their conception. The divine twins were born
on the holy island of Delos.
As his seventh and last wife in Hesiod’s account, or as his only wife in the 
usual tradition, Zeus married his sister Hera.76 It is indicated plainly enough in
the Iliad that she was his ﬁrst choice rather than his last, and it is even implied in
one passage that the pair ﬁrst made love before the banishment of Kronos.77 As the
— The rise of Zeus and revolts against his rule —
78

great goddess of Argos since time immemorial, Hera was perhaps the most august
of all the Greek goddesses, and it is thus understandable that she should have come
to be linked to Zeus as his legitimate spouse, even though she would originally
have had no connection with him. In matters of cult, indeed, she remained largely
independent of him. She was primarily the goddess of marriage and married women;
her nature, functions and myths will be examined in Chapter 5.
Hera bore three children to Zeus as the offspring of their marriage, namely 
Hebe, Ares and Eileithuia; and as a counter-miracle to the birth of Athena from 
the head of Zeus, she brought forth Hephaistos as a son of her very own without
prior intercourse with her husband.78 Such is the account in the Theogony at least; 
but in other sources, including the Homeric epics, Hephaistos is often regarded as an 
ordinary child of Zeus and Hera.79 The character and myths of this god of ﬁre and
metal-working will be considered in Chapter 6, as will those of his murderous brother
or half-brother, Ares, the god of war. Hebe and Eileithuia, two deities of relatively
minor signiﬁcance, are very appropriate children for a goddess who was intimately
connected with the life of women, being respectively the goddess who personiﬁed the
bloom of youth and the goddess of childbirth. Both goddesses appear in cult, though
only to a very limited extent in the case of Hebe; neither of them makes much appear-
ance in myth. Only a single story of any note is recorded for HEBE, namely that she
married Herakles after he was raised to Olympos as a god and so came to share in 
the eternal youth of the immortals (see p. 286). She was otherwise available to
perform minor services for her fellow Olympians, for instance as a cupbearer;80
and according to a tale from Euripides, she once rejuvenated Iolaos, a nephew of
Herakles, to enable him to kill a hated enemy of his family (see p. 288). Although
EILEITHUIA is mentioned quite often in connection with her positive function in
easing childbirth, she makes her most signiﬁcant appearances in myth in two 
stories in which Hera sets out to hinder the birth of illegitimate children of Zeus; 
for Hera was said to have detained Eileithuia on Olympos when Leto was due to 
give birth to Apollo and Artemis (see pp. 188–9), and to have instructed her or the
Eileithuiai to retard the birth of Herakles (see p. 248).
At Olympia in the province of Elis, Eileithuia was honoured in conjunction with a divine
child called Sosipolis. The origin of this cult was explained by the following legend. On a
certain occasion long ago, as the Eleians were expecting a counter-attack from an invading
army of Arcadians, a local woman approached the Eleian commanders with a baby, and told
them that he was her own son and that a dream had ordered her to hand him over to ﬁght
for Elis. Taking her at her word, the authorities laid him naked in front of the army; and
when the Arcadians advanced, he changed into a snake, causing them such alarm that they
turned and ﬂed. After their victory, the Eleians raised a temple to the child at the spot
where they thought that the snake had disappeared into the ground. They called the new
god-child Sosipolis (Saviour of the State), and decided to worship Eileithuia in conjunction
with him because ‘she had brought him into the world’ (a lame explanation by any stan-
dards).81 There seems little doubt that Eileithuia, with her non-Greek name and Cretan
origin, appears here as the divine mother of a divine child, quite on the Cretan model.
Homer and subsequent authors sometimes refer to Eileithuiai in the plural.82 The name
Eileithuia also appears as a title of Hera and Artemis, two major goddesses who concerned
themselves with childbirth. The Romans equated Eileithuia with Lucina or Iuno Lucina,
their goddess of childbirth.

— The rise of Zeus and revolts against his rule —
79

There is one consort of Zeus, possibly the oldest of all, who is not to be found in
Hesiod’s list, namely DIONE. Although she is mentioned twice in the Theogony,
ﬁrst among the deities who are praised in the processional songs of the Muses 
(which would imply that she was a goddess of some eminence), and then among
the daughters of Okeanos,83 it is nowhere suggested that she has any special
connection with Zeus. But Homer refers to her as the mother of Aphrodite, who is
indubitably a daughter of Zeus in his poems, and he must therefore have known 
of the union between Zeus and Dione; she comforts and consoles Aphrodite in the
Iliad when she arrives on Olympos after being wounded in battle by Diomedes 
(see p. 461).84 There are various indications that suggest than she was once of greater
importance than might be inferred from the scant mention of her in the works of
the main poets. The Homeric Hymn to Apollo includes her, for instance, among the
foremost goddesses who attended Leto’s childbearing;85 and it is itself signiﬁcant
that her name seems to be no more than a feminine equivalent of that of Zeus
(which takes the form of Dios in the genitive). In classical times, she was a major
goddess only at Dodona in Epirus, the site of an ancient oracle of Zeus, where she
was honoured as the consort of Zeus Naios (of the running water).86 Pherecydes
describes Dione as a nymph of Dodona for understandable reasons, while Apollo-
dorus makes her a far grander ﬁgure by numbering her among the Titans.87 Hesiod’s
account of the origin of Aphrodite (see p. 67) largely supplanted the account in the
Iliad that made her a daughter of Dione; this latter relationship is never reﬂected
in cult, although poets in the later tradition sometimes refer to Aphrodite as Dionaie
(i.e. daughter of Dione) or even call her Dione.
At this point, it may be useful to take stock of the origins of the main Olympian
gods. As was remarked above, these were either brothers and sisters of Zeus or else
children of his, with the possible exception of Aphrodite, if she was born from the
sea-foam that surrounded the severed genitals of Ouranos (as in Hesiod’s account,
see p. 67), and Hephaistos, if he was a child of Hera alone. If Aphrodite is left aside
for the present, the major Olympians can be divided into three groups. Those who
belonged to the ﬁrst generation as children of Kronos and Rhea were Zeus, Hera,
Poseidon, and Hestia. Although Hades also belonged to this generation, he lived
far away from Olympos in his underground realm. Four major gods were born as
children of Zeus in the next generation, namely Athena, who was born from his
head, and Apollo and Artemis, his twin children by Leto, and Ares, who was born
to him as one of his children by Hera. Hephaistos also belongs to this generation,
whether he was a son of Zeus and Hera or a son of Hera alone. And ﬁnally, during
the heroic era, Zeus fathered Dionysos and Hermes by two mortal women, Semele,
daughter of Kadmos, and Maia, daughter of Atlas, respectively. As for Aphrodite,
she was the ﬁrst-born of the Olympians if she was born in the manner described
above, as was commonly assumed; or she belonged to the second generation if she
was the daughter of Zeus and Dione as in the Homeric account. The genealogies
of the Olympian gods are summarized in Table 1.
From the classical period onwards, it was commonly believed that there were
twelve principal gods, an idea that was derived from cultic rather than strictly
mythological considerations. The cult of the Twelve Gods originated in Asia Minor
during the archaic period and was ﬁrmly established on the Greek mainland by the
— The rise of Zeus and revolts against his rule —
80

ﬁfth century BC; Pindar refers to the cult of the Twelve Gods at Olympia, where
they were honoured at six altars, and Herodotus and Thucydides both mention an 
altar that was raised to them in the Athenian agora by the younger Peisistratos.88
The canonic list of the Twelve, as established at Athens and later transferred to
Rome, ran as follows: Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Demeter, Apollo, Artemis, Ares,
Aphrodite, Hermes, Athena, Hephaistos and Hestia.89 It will be noted that Hestia,
who enjoyed a certain precedence in cult but was of no importance in myth (see 
p. 139), is included in the list while Dionysos is absent; but those who are named
in it are otherwise the deities who would be regarded as the principal Olympians
from a mythological point of view. A variety of other gods were listed among the
Twelve in connection with the cult of the Twelve Gods in other localities. The
following gods were honoured, for instance, at the six altars at Olympia: Zeus
Olympios, Poseidon, Hera, Athena, Hermes, Apollo, the Charites (Graces), Dionysos,
Athena, Alpheios (a river-god of the area, see p. 42), Kronos and Rhea.90
The great gods of the Greeks were fully anthropomorphic, even if some lesser
divinities and nature-spirits had animal features (and some thoroughgoing monsters
are included in the divine genealogies, mostly as descendants of Pontos). Like their
counterparts in the Near East, making due exception for Egypt, they were imag-
ined as glorious beings who were human in their outward appearance and broadly
comparable to human beings in their emotions and desires and their family and
social life. They differed from mortals, however, in two respects above all, that their
bodies were immortal and unageing (though not immune to temporary harm), and
that they enjoyed a form of bodily existence that imposed lesser restraints by far on
their capacities than does our own. They were born as a result of sexual activity and
had to grow up (even if they were sometimes wonderfully precocious, see for instance
pp. 144 and 162), but they developed and grew no further after reaching their
proper maturity; some were imagined as being youthful in appearance, others as
more mature and majestic. The image of a god was not always ﬁxed; Dionysos
became more youthful as the tradition evolved, and a lesser god, Eros, even regressed
into infancy. Although they needed food and drink to sustain their bodies, they
were nourished by special divine food, nectar and ambrosia, which can be pictured
as bearing some resemblance to honey and a honey-drink respectively; and a divine
ﬂuid, ichor, therefore ran through their veins rather than ordinary human blood,
and they were immune to age and decay. This aspect of their physiology is summed
up by Homer in connection with a wound suffered by Aphrodite, which caused the
‘divine blood of the goddess’ to ﬂow out, ‘ichor, such as runs through the veins of
the blessed gods, for they eat no bread nor do they drink shining wine, and are
therefore bloodless and are called immortals’.91 Since they were immortal, there
could be no question of their dying if they should be deprived of their proper nour-
ishment; according to Hesiod, a god would sink into a coma if he should be deprived
of it for a year for breaking his solemn oath (see p. 49), and so lose his vitality 
and power of speech. Nor could they die from wounds suffered in ﬁghts or battles,
but they could suffer pain and beneﬁt from the attention of a healer (as does Ares
on one occasion in the Iliad), and they could be rendered insensible. And more
broadly, their powers, though ﬁnite and corporeal, were much less limited than
those of mortals; they could go immense distances in very little time, transform

very far off, hear in heaven prayers made on earth, or even help or harm without
actually being present.
THE REVOLT OF TYPHON
After winning power by revolting against Kronos, Zeus had to suppress a few revolts
against his own rule. Since he was so much stronger than the other Olympian gods,
threats would usually sufﬁce to deter them from opposing his will, let alone from
rebelling against his rule. In a striking passage in the Iliad, he boasts that if all the
other gods and goddesses grasped one end of a golden cord and he the other, they
would be unable to drag him down from Olympos, whereas he, if he set his mind
to it, could haul them all up along with the earth and sea besides; and he could
then tie the cord around a peak of Olympos, leaving everything dangling in mid-
air.92 Homer does report, however, that Hera, Athena and Poseidon had once planned
to overpower Zeus and tie him up, but were foiled by the prompt action of Thetis,
who summoned the hundred-handed Briareos (see p. 67) up from the sea to intim-
idate them.93 There is no way of telling whether the poet drew this story from the
prior tradition or simply invented it. Since the deities in question were ardent
supporters of the Greek cause in the Trojan War, and often clash with Zeus on that
account within the Iliad itself, it is certainly possible that there may have been an
ancient tale in which they attempted to force their will on Zeus at some stage in
the conﬂict. It was commonly agreed, however, that all the serious revolts against
Zeus came from outside the Olympian circle, and were directed against the
Olympian order as a whole. In the ﬁrst place, Gaia brought forth beings of enor-
mous size and power on two successive occasions, the monstrous Typhon and the
race of the Giants, to make war against Zeus and the new ruling gods; and a further
— The rise of Zeus and revolts against his rule —
82

revolt was mounted thereafter by the Aloadai, two gigantic sons of Poseidon who
attempted to storm Olympos.
The myth of Typhon was almost certainly of earlier origin than that of the war
between the gods and the Giants, which is not mentioned in Hesiod’s Theogony.
TYPHON (Typhaon in epic) or TYPHOEUS was the most terrible of these adver-
saries of Zeus, for he was so immensely strong that he could threaten the divine
order single-handedly. According to Hesiod (who uses both forms of his name), Gaia
bore him to Tartaros as the last of her primordial children, and he was such a formi-
dable monster that he might well have succeeded in his revolt if Zeus had not been
quick to respond to the threat.
Strength lay in his hands, and the feet of the mighty god were untiring; and
from his shoulders sprang a hundred serpent’s heads, terrible dragon’s heads
with dark ﬂickering tongues, and the eyes beneath the brows of these wondrous
heads ﬂashed ﬁre, and ﬁre blazed from every head as he glared around. In all
his dreadful heads there were voices that sent forth every kind of unspeakable
sound, for at one time they uttered words that would be comprehensible to
the gods, and at other times sounds like those of a bellowing bull, proud in
its untamed fury, and sometimes like those of a lion, relentless in its valour,
and sometimes like those of yelping puppies, a wonder to hear, and sometimes
he would hiss like a snake until the high mountains echoed.94
Although eloquent in its clumsy fashion, this earliest description of Typhon is
neither complete nor precise. In the next literary portrait of him, from a prose
summary of a poem by Nicander (second century BC), he has a great many arms in
addition to his many heads, and he is also equipped with wings and has enormous
dragon’s coils springing from his thighs.95 The wings can be found at an earlier
period in vase-paintings, which generally depict Typhon as a composite being with
a human head and torso and a lower body formed from two or more serpent’s tails.
Since snakes are chthonic beings that emerge from crevices in earth, earth-born men
or monsters are quite often imagined as being serpent-tailed (as in the case of
Kekrops, see p. 364, or the Giants in later portrayals). In Apollodorus’ description
of Typhon, which is full and memorable if muddled in places, there seems to be
some confusion between these serpent’s tails, as found in artistic images, and the
serpent’s heads that spring from Typhon’s shoulders in the Theogony; for we are told
that a hundred dragon’s heads sprang from his arms, and that the serpent’s coils
from beneath his thighs reached up to his head when fully extended and emitted
violent hisses. He was of such monstrous size (so the mythographer states) that he
rose higher than any mountain, and could reach out to the east and the west with
his outstretched arms; and he had wings all over his body, and foul hair sprang
from his head and cheeks, and ﬁre ﬂashed from his eyes.96
In the early account by Hesiod, the issue is settled by single combat between Zeus
and Typhon. Rising up against the monster in all his strength, Zeus thundered
mightily as Typhon poured forth ﬂame, until the earth, sea and sky began to boil, and
the world to shake, causing even Hades to tremble in the subterranean land of the
dead, and the Titans far below in Tartaros. Zeus leapt down from Olympos after these
initial exchanges, and struck at Typhon and lashed him and burned his many

heads, forcing him down to the ground as a maimed and helpless wreck; and he
then completed his victory by hurling him down to Tartaros.97 Nothing was left
of him in the world above apart from his progeny, namely his offspring by Echidna
(see p. 62) and all the ﬁerce and harmful winds that bring danger to sailors and
damage the crops.98 These noxious winds of Typhoean origin are distinguished from
the divine and beneﬁcial winds that were brought forth by Eos (see p. 48). Hesiod
does not explain why Gaia, who was otherwise well-disposed toward Zeus, should
have wished to give birth to this threatening monster, nor does he state that she
did so with hostile intent. According to Apollodorus, Gaia brought forth the Giants
ﬁrst of all in anger at the fate of the Titans, and brought forth Typhon as a further
danger to the gods after the Giants were defeated by them (see further on p. 90).99
The Homeric Hymn to Apollo offers a different account of Typhon’s origin in which Hera is
said to have brought him to birth as a fatherless child because she was furious that her
husband should have brought Athena to birth without her involvement (i.e. from his head).
In her anger, she struck the ground with her hand and prayed to Earth, Sky and the Titans
that she should bear a child on her own that would be as much stronger than Zeus as Zeus
was stronger than Kronos. She gave birth in due time to Typhon, a being who resembled
neither the gods nor mortal men, and she entrusted him to the Delphian she-dragon to be
reared. The poet tells us very little about the subsequent life of the monster, merely observing
twice that it was a danger to mortals.100 According to a strange account from the Homeric
scholia, Gaia complained to Hera after the slaughter of the Giants, prompting her to approach
Kronos, who gave her two eggs smeared with his own semen and told her to bury them in
the ground, saying that they would generate a being who would deprive Zeus of his power.
Hera buried them as instructed, in Cilicia in Asia Minor, and the monstrous Typhon was
born from them; but she then had second thoughts and informed Zeus, who struck Typhon
down with a thunderbolt.101
In post-Hesiodic accounts of Typhon’s career, many new features are introduced into
his story, mainly from the east. Since Apollodorus provides a composite account that
includes most of these new elements, it will be convenient to summarize his narra-
tive before considering certain elements in further detail. When Typhon launched
an attack against heaven itself, hurling ﬂaming rocks and emitting fearsome hisses
and screams, the gods were so terriﬁed that they ﬂed to Egypt, where they concealed
themselves by transforming themselves into animals of various kinds. So Zeus was
obliged to confront Typhon on his own, ﬁrst pelting him with thunderbolts from
a distance, and then striking at him with an adamantine sickle (harpe¯). After pursuing
the wounded monster to Mt Kasion in Syria, he grappled with him face to face;
but Typhon enveloped Zeus in his coils, wrested the sickle from him, and used it
to cut the tendons from his hands and feet. He then carried him through the sea
to Cilicia and deposited him in a cave there (the Corycian cave), hiding the severed
tendons inside in a bear’s skin; and he appointed a fellow-monster as guard, the
she-dragon Delphyne, who was formed half like a snake and half like a beautiful
maiden. Hermes and Aigipan (Goat-Pan) managed to steal tendons, however, and
ﬁtted them back into Zeus, who soon recovered his vigour and returned to the fray.
Descending from heaven in a chariot, he hurled thunderbolts at Typhon and pursued
— The rise of Zeus and revolts against his rule —
84

him to Mt Nysa (of uncertain location, see p. 172), where the Moirai (Fates) deceived
him into eating the ‘ephemeral fruits’ (otherwise unknown), which robbed him of
some of his strength. When pursued onward to Haimon, a mountain-range in Thrace
(or now Bulgaria), he was still strong enough to hurl entire mountains at Zeus; but
Zeus hurled them back at him by means of a thunderbolt, causing him to shed so
much blood (haima) that the range below was known as Haimon from that time
forth. He then ﬂed overseas to Sicily, where Zeus completed his victory by burying
him under Mt Etna.102
The ignominious tale of the ﬂight and transformation of the gods was of earlier
origin than one might suppose if Pindar did indeed recount it in one of his pro-
cessional odes, as is reported.103 It was inspired by an Egyptian myth in which the
god Seth and his followers were said to have transformed themselves into animals
when pursued by Horus. Since the Greeks identiﬁed Typhon with Seth rather than
the pursuer Horus and had no interest in the original signiﬁcance of the trans-
formations, the myth was naturally much altered when they adapted it for their 
own purposes, to provide a mythical explanation for the theriomorphic nature of
the Egyptian gods. In the earliest version to have survived, as ascribed to Nicander,
all the gods ﬂed in a panic apart from Zeus, and they turned themselves into animals
on their arrival in Egypt, Apollo into a hawk, Hermes into an ibis, Artemis into a
cat, Hephaistos into an ox, and so forth.104 The basic pattern is obvious enough: 
the Greek gods are identiﬁed with speciﬁc Egyptian gods in accordance with
accepted tradition, and are said to have transformed themselves into the animal form
associated with that Egyptian god. If the animal in question has some connection
with the respective Greek god in native myth or cult, so much the better, but that
is not the essential point. So Apollo, for instance, who happens to be compared to
a hawk in the Iliad and elsewhere,105 turns himself into a falcon in the present myth
because he was identiﬁed with the Egyptian god Horus,106 who was represented as
a falcon or with a falcon’s head. Ovid neglects the point in his later version by
saying that Apollo turned himself into a crow, the bird that was most closely asso-
ciated with him in Greek myth.107
A further detail is added to the story in astral mythology to provide a mythical explanation
for the origin of Capricorn, a constellation representing a ‘goat-ﬁsh’, a Mesopotamian monster
that had no counterpart in Greek myth. After ﬂeeing to Egypt along with the other god,
goat-footed Pan threw himself into the Nile, turning his hindquarters into those of a ﬁsh
and his forequarters into those of a goat; and Zeus was so impressed by his ingenious disguise
that he placed an image of the resulting goat-ﬁsh among the stars.108
Although Apollodorus’ narrative takes Typhon into other areas besides, he was most
closely associated with Asia Minor, especially the south-eastern province of Cilicia,
which may well have been his original homeland. In a passing reference in the Iliad,
Homer states that he lay in the land of the Arimoi (ein Arimois, a phrase that was
also interpreted as referring to some mountains called the Arima);109 and Hesiod
states correspondingly that Echidna, a monster who bore children to Typhon in his
account (see p. 62), lived in a cave beneath the earth ein Arimoisin.110 Most scholars

of Hellenistic and later times believed that the Arimoi were a people who lived
somewhere in Asia Minor;111 but even if they were right, as is likely enough, their
ideas were apparently based on conjecture rather than direct evidence from the early
tradition. It seems to have been well-established by Pindar’s time in any case that
Cilicia was Typhon’s homeland, for the poet refers to him as ‘Cilician Typhoeus’,
and remarks that he was reared in the ‘renowned Cilician cave’ that plays such an
important part in Apollodorus’ narrative.112 Apollodorus’ story of the stolen sinews
was surely taken over from Near Eastern mythology; it has been observed that there
is a parallel in the Hittite tale of the struggle between the Storm-god and the dragon
Illuyanka. In that myth, the Storm-god was initially defeated by Illuyanka, who
robbed him of his heart and eyes; but he went on to father a son who married the
dragon’s daughter and recovered the stolen heart and eyes with his wife’s aid. When
the Storm-god was then restored to his original condition, he set out against the
dragon for a second time and killed him.113
Typhon’s connection with Etna was fairly old even if it could not have been a
very ancient feature of his legend. Pindar and the Prometheus Bound already mention
that he is buried under the volcano and causes its eruptions by breathing forth
streams of ﬁre.114 Apollodorus seems to be exceptional in ascribing the eruptions to
the after-effects of the thunderbolts that were hurled against him by Zeus. According
to an alternative tradition ﬁrst recorded by Pherecydes, Zeus buried Typhon under
the island of Pythekousai (i.e. Ischia, off Naples, which contains hot springs and a
volcano which was still active in antiquity).115 Other mythical explanations were
also offered for the ﬂame and smoke of Etna, for some claimed that the Giant
Enkelados was buried under it (see p. 86), or that the forge of Hephaistos was located
in it (see p. 166).
THE REVOLT OF THE GIANTS
The other major revolt against Zeus and the Olympian order was launched by the
GIANTS (Gigantes), who were defeated by the gods with the aid of Herakles in
the mighty conﬂict known as Gigantomachy (Gigantomachia). The Giants were earth-
born as their Greek name implies; according to the Theogony, they were conceived
by Gaia in the very earliest times from drops of blood that fell to the ground from
the severed genitals of Ouranos.116 Hesiod describes them as powerful warriors who
wore gleaming armour and carried long spears in their hands, an account that
conforms with the usual portrayal of them in archaic works of art. It is not clear
whether the poet meant to suggest that they sprang up from the ground fully armed
(like the Spartoi at Thebes, see p. 296); Claudian, a Roman poet of the fourth
century AD, is the ﬁrst author to state this explicitly.117 Even though the Giants
are presented as martial beings, there is no indication in the Theogony that they ever
revolted against the gods (except perhaps in a late section of the poem probably
added after Hesiod’s time, which seems to refer to the contribution that Herakles
was supposed to have made in helping to defeat the Giants).118 There is indeed no
proper evidence at all for the revolt until the ﬁrst artistic representations appear in
the second half of the sixth century BC.

The Battle of the Gods and Giants. A detail of the Great Altar of Pergamon.
Pergamon-Museum, Berlin.

Homer alludes to Gigantes on three occasions in the Odyssey. The Laistrygonians, some adver-
saries of Odysseus in the remote seas who seem to have been very large and were certainly
very violent (see p. 494), are described as being ‘not like men, but like Giants’; in another
passage, ‘the wild tribes of the Giants’ are bracketed with the Phaeacians and Kyklopes as
beings who are akin to the gods; and third, we are told that a certain Eurymedon once ruled
the overbearing Giants but brought destruction on himself and his people (in unstated
circumstances).119 There is no reason to suppose that the latter story has anything to do
with a revolt against the gods; nor can we assume that these Giants, who seem to have lived
far away over the sea, were necessarily the same as Hesiod’s (any more than in the case of
the Kyklopes, see p. 66). According to a tale ascribed to the Hellenistic poet Euphorion,
Hera was raped by the Giant Eurymedon while she was still living at home with her parents,
and bore Prometheus to him as a son. When Zeus came to learn of this after marrying her,
he hurled Eurymedon down to Tartaros and ordered that Prometheus should be thrown 
into chains, using his theft of ﬁre as a pretext.120 The obscure reference to Erymedon in the
Odyssey must have inspired the invention of this revisionist myth.
It seems likely that the main features of the story of the Giants’ revolt was established
in an early epic account which was widely familiar by the early sixth century BC
and came to be accepted as canonic. The richness and consistency of the artistic
record from the sixth and ﬁfth centuries would otherwise be hard to explain; and
the popularity of the story in this period is also indicated in a disapproving remark
by Xenophanes (born c.570), who mentions the Gigantomachy along with the
Titanomachy as a violent subject best avoided in after-dinner recitations.121 The
earliest literary allusions reveal nothing about the content of the legend apart from
the location of the battle and its most surprising feature, namely that the gods 
had to call on the assistance of Herakles (during the period of his earthly life when
he was no more than a mortal hero). Pindar mentions that he brought the Giants
to the ground with his arrows, including their king, Porphyrion, as they were
confronting the gods on the plain of Phlegrai; and the Hesiodic Catalogue reports
likewise that he brought destruction to the Giants at Phlegrai as he was returning
from his campaign against Troy.122 On maps of the Aegean, the most striking feature
of its northern shoreline is the Chalkidike with its three ‘prongs’, the peninsulas of
Pallene, Sithonia and Athos. Phlegra or Phlegrai, the traditional home of the Giants,
was usually identiﬁed with the westernmost peninsula, Pallene (although the
adjoining peninsula of Sithonia and some of the hinterland of the Chalkidike were
sometimes also reckoned to be part of it). Although the Giants seem to have
confronted the gods on their home ground of Phlegrai in the original story, accounts
were developed in which they took the battle to the enemy by trying to storm
Olympos; and speciﬁc duels were said to have ranged further abroad, as we will see,
to the southern Aegean and as far away as Sicily. Some Hellenistic and later accounts
transfer the entire conﬂict to other regions, such as Arcadia or the Phlegraean (Fiery)
plain in the neighbourhood of Mt Vesuvius in Italy.123
Apollodorus is the ﬁrst author to provide a full surviving account of the progress
of the conﬂict. If the individual motifs from his narrative are checked against the
earliest artistic and literary record, it soon becomes evident that this is a composite
version which was constructed mainly from early material but also contains a few
stories (or variants) from the later tradition. An element that was certainly old is
— The rise of Zeus and revolts against his rule —
88

the involvement of Herakles. The gods knew from an oracle that none of the Giants
could be killed by them unless a mortal ally was present to ﬁnish them off; so
Athena summoned the aid of the greatest of mortal heroes, Herakles, who was on
the island of Cos at the time, having been driven there by storm-winds as he was
sailing back from Troy (see p. 276). Now Gaia too was aware of this oracle, and
tried to circumvent it by searching for a herb that would prevent her sons from
being killed even by this mortal helper; but Zeus spoiled her plan by ordering Dawn
and the Sun and Moon not to shine until he had plucked the herb himself. From
that moment, the fate of the Giants was sealed.124 This motif of the essential helper
in which gods (or kings) have to depend on an inferior to achieve their victories
can be found in the myths and folklore of many lands; we have already seen that
Zeus had to rely on the Hundred-Handers to defeat the Titans. In an alternative
account which was probably of Hellenistic origin, the gods had to seek the help of
two ‘demi-gods’ and summoned Herakles and Dionysos,125 who had both been
fathered by Zeus on mortal mothers (and could thus be said to have earned their
divine status by their services to the gods on this occasion).
The most dangerous of the Giants were Porphyrion (who is already singled out
by Pindar and Aristophanes126), and Alkyoneus, who was immortal as long as he
fought on his native soil. In Apollodorus’ narrative, Alkyoneus is the ﬁrst victim of
Herakles, who kills him without any immediate divine assistance at the beginning
of the battle. Although the Giant began to recover his strength when he was brought
to the god by the hero’s arrows in his native Pallene, Herakles dragged him beyond
the frontiers of the land on the advice of Athena, and was then able to put him to
death.127
There was a tradition that claimed that Alkyoneus provoked the entire conﬂict by rustling
the cattle of the sun-god Helios.128 Herakles’ encounter with him was sometimes presented
as a separate incident which had nothing to do with the Gigantomachy. According to Pindar,
Alkyoneus confronted Herakles at Phlegrai as the hero was returning from his Trojan
campaign with Telamon and other allies. Herakles shot him down, though not before he
had destroyed twelve chariots by hurling a huge rock at them. Since the episode is placed
in the homeland of the Giants and is associated with Herakles’ Trojan expedition as usual,
this was presumably a secondary version in which the incident was detached from the general
conﬂict. Pindar describes Alkyoneus as a herdsman who was as huge as a mountain without
specifying that he was a Gigas.129 The scholia to the passage record another version in which
Alkyoneus attacked Herakles and his companions at the Isthmus of Corinth as the hero 
was driving the cattle of Geryoneus to Argos.130 In a version that is known only from vase-
paintings, Herakles catches Alkyoneus by surprise while he is lying asleep on the ground,
creeping up on him with his club or sword in his hand.
We must now trace the story to its conclusion as recounted in Apollodorus’ version.
After the death of Alkyoneus, Porphyrion launched an attack against Herakles and
Hera, but Zeus distracted him by inspiring him with a lust for Hera and then struck
him with a thunderbolt as he was tearing at the goddess’s robes. Although this
would surely have sufﬁced to kill the Giant in ordinary circumstances, Herakles in
his role as special helper of the gods was obliged to ﬁnish him off with one of his
arrows; and likewise in every succeeding case, gods would bring Giants to the ground

in their various ways, leaving it for Herakles to deal the death-blow with his arrows.
Since Apollo was a consummate archer like Herakles, the two of them attacked the
Giant Ephialtes in conjunction, Apollo shooting him in the left eye and Herakles
in the right; Dionysos and Hekate used their cultic emblems, the thyrsos and ﬂaming
torches respectively, against two other Giants, Eurytos and Klytios; Hephaistos, the
divine blacksmith, pelted Mimas with missiles of red-hot iron; Athena killed the
ﬂeeing Enkelados by hurling the island of Sicily on top of him, and ﬂayed another
Giant, Pallas, to use his skin as a shield; while pursuing the Giant Polybotes through
the Aegean, Poseidon broke a corner off the island of Cos and hurled it down on
him, so creating the little island of Nisyros not far to the south; Hades, who wore
the cap of invisibility (see p. 240) to hide himself from sight, felled another Giant,
as did Artemis; the Moirai (Fates) brought two opponents down with bronze cudgels;
and Zeus attacked others with thunderbolts, while Herakles shot every one of them
as they lay close to death on the ground.131 Although Ares is omitted from this
narrative, he appears as an adversary of the Giants, especially Mimas, in vase-
paintings and literary sources.132 Of the two stories in which Giants have islands
deposited on them, that in which Polybotes is buried under Nisyros probably orig-
inated in epic since it can be found in sixth-century vase-paintings, while the story
of Enkelados with its more distant setting in the west was apparently of Hellenistic
origin.133
The Giants were pictured in different ways at different periods. In the earliest
images from the sixth century BC, they are generally portrayed as handsome hoplite
warriors who wear armour and a helmet and ﬁght with a lance or sword (or occa-
sionally wield rocks when necessity demands, as do Homeric warriors). Although
they must obviously have been very large and powerful if they were to match them-
selves against the gods, they were not originally imagined as giants in the full
modern sense of the word. It is signiﬁcant in this respect that when an ordinary
mortal is called a gigas in early Greek literature, as is the brutal Kapaneus (see 
p. 320) in Aeschylus’ Seven against Thebes, the word is suggestive of reckless or
impious violence rather than exceptional size.134 In the ﬁfth century, an alternative
representation appears in which the Giants are depicted as wild and primitive beings
who dress in animal skins or simple tunics (or are even naked) and use rocks and
boulders as their usual weapons. And ﬁnally, from the Hellenistic period onwards,
the Giants are often depicted with serpent’s coils for legs, as would be appropriate
for earth-born beings, and as wholly gigantic in stature.135
In Apollodorus’ account of the earliest history of the world, Earth is said to have
brought the Giants to birth because she was angered by the fate of the Titans (who
were children of hers); and when the Giants were defeated by Zeus and the Olympian
gods just as the Titans had been before them, Earth’s rage grew all the greater and
she brought Typhon to birth to provide a further threat to the Olympian order.136
Although this narrative orders the various conﬂicts into a tidy pattern, it presents
certain difﬁculties because, in the ﬁrst place, Earth had previously assisted Zeus
against Kronos and the Titans (in Apollodorus’ account as in Hesiod’s, through her
advice on more than one occasion), and, in the second place, Herakles’ presence at
the Gigantomachy would imply that it took place in the heroic era soon 
before the Trojan War rather than in the earliest times soon after the Titanomachy.
— The rise of Zeus and revolts against his rule —
90

The Theogony, which makes no reference of course to a revolt of the Giants, dates
the revolt of Typhon to the period immediately following the Titanomachy, after
the Titans have been banished from the upper world but before the gods have
formally invited Zeus to become the new ruler. Although one might infer from
Hesiod’s narrative that Gaia brought Typhon to birth in anger at the fate of the
Titans (as Apollodorus says of the Giants), nothing is actually stated on the
matter.137
THE ALOADAI AND THEIR REVOLT
Two gigantic sons of Poseidon called the ALOADAI (or Aloads in Anglicized form)
were the last beings to mount a major revolt against the Olympian order, or at least
threaten to do so. Although they were named after their putative father Aloeus, a
Thessalian hero of Aiolid descent (see p. 410), they were really the product of an
extramarital liaison between his wife Iphimedeia and the great god of the seas.138
According to Apollodorus, whose account may well have been drawn from the early
tradition, Iphimedeia fell in love with Poseidon and used to make repeated visits
to the sea-shore, where she would scoop water from the sea with her hands and pour
it into her lap, until the sea-god emerged from his realm one day and had inter-
course with her.139 She would presumably have become pregnant through contact
with the seawater alone in the original story. There is also an alternative account
of Hellenistic origin in which the Aloadai are described as earth-born, like the Giants
and Typhon before them.140 Their individual names were Otos and Ephialtes.
Their legend may best be approached through the earliest account in the Odyssey,
which tells how Odysseus met the shade of Iphimedeia in the Underworld and
learned from her that she had
slept with Poseidon and so given birth to two sons, who were but short-lived,
god-like Otos and far-famed Ephialtes, the tallest men who were ever nurtured
by the grain-giving earth, and the most handsome by far after famous Orion.
At nine years of age they were nine cubits [i.e. about fourteen feet] across,
and nine fathoms [over ﬁfty feet] in height; and the two of them threatened
to raise the din of furious battle against the very gods on Olympos. They
desired to pile Ossa on to Olympos and Pelion with its waving forests on to
Ossa to enable them to scale the heavens; and they would have accomplished
it if they had reached the full measure of their growth; but the son of Zeus
whom Leto of the beautiful tresses brought forth [i.e. Apollo] destroyed them
both before the down blossomed beneath their temples and their cheeks were
clothed with the bloom of a young beard.141
Pelion and Ossa were the two greatest mountains of Magnesia, the coastal district
of northern Thessaly, and Olympos was the next great mountain to the north. It is
suggested in later accounts that the Aloadai actually piled up the mountains before
they were stopped.142
Homer’s narrative tells us less than we might want to know. How did Apollo
kill the Aloadai, for instance, and did he take that action speciﬁcally to prevent

them from storming heaven? Later authors link their death to misguided actions of
theirs in the amatory sphere. According to the usual story, Ephialtes made unwel-
come advances to Hera, and Otos to Artemis, provoking Artemis to cause their
death on Naxos by means of a deception. For she turned herself into a deer and ran
between them while they were out hunting, causing them to kill one another with
their hunting-spears as they tried to hit the deer.143 In some form at least, this story
may well have been quite ancient, since Pindar already mentions that they met their
death on Naxos.144 Hyginus offers a rather different version, stating that Apollo
sent a deer between them, with the same consequence, to divert them while they
were attempting to rape Artemis. An interesting detail is added here, namely that
they were punished for their misbehaviour in Hades, by being tied back-to-back by
snakes to a column on which a screech-owl was seated.145 It may be relevant to this
latter tale that Otos shares his name with a species of owl in Greek; perhaps the
brothers were tormented forever by the screeching of the owl.
Another fragment of the legend of the Aloadai can be traced back as far as the
Iliad, which tells how they once tied up Ares, the god of war, and imprisoned him
in a bronze jar for thirteen months; ‘and there Ares, insatiate of war, would even
have perished, if their stepmother, the all-beautiful Eereboia, had not brought news
of the matter to Hermes; he then stole Ares away when he was already greatly weak-
ened, for his cruel imprisonment was wearing him down’.146 It would be interesting
to know whether the Aloadai took this action to remove the war-god from the scene
before launching their attack on heaven, or whether this was a wholly separate inci-
dent. For what it is worth, Homer’s ancient commentators explain that Ares had
angered the Aloadai by killing the young Adonis (see p. 199) after Aphrodite had
asked them to watch over him;147 but it seems most unlikely that this would have
had anything to do with the original story of Ares’ imprisonment.
The Aloadai were also credited with more constructive achievements. They were said to have
founded Askra, the home-town of Hesiod in Boeotia, and to have inaugurated the cult of
the Muses on Mt Helikon.148 After their mother and sister Pankratis (or Pankrato) were
abducted to Naxos, they sailed in search of them at the bidding of their father, and seized
control of the island; they eventually quarrelled, however, and killed one another in battle
in their island-kingdom.149 It was stated in this connection that they were buried on Naxos,
where they were honoured in hero-cult in historical times; but their graves could also be
seen at Anthedon on the Boeotian coast, and Otos had yet another grave on Crete.150
Iphimedeia for her part was worshipped at Mylasa in Caria.151
ZEUS AND PROMETHEUS
PROMETHEUS, a son of the Titan Iapetos (see p. 49), revolted against the authority
of his cousin Zeus not in the hope of gaining power on his own account, after the
manner of Typhon and the Giants, but to bring beneﬁts and justice to the human
race; and by resorting to subterfuge rather than the use of force, he achieved a
considerable measure of success, even if he had to pay a heavy penalty afterwards.
The myth of Prometheus was altered and developed signiﬁcantly as time pro-
gressed. In the Hesiodic poems, he advanced the interests of mortals in two speciﬁc
— The rise of Zeus and revolts against his rule —
92

respects alone and suffered for his actions ever afterwards, while in the later tradition
from Aeschylus onwards, he was the general benefactor (and sometimes even the
creator and saviour) of the human race, and was eventually freed from his punish-
ment and reconciled with Zeus. We will start with Hesiod’s account of his story in
the Theogony.
When gods and mortals ceased to meet directly and eat together, a new rela-
tionship was established in which mortals would sacriﬁce animals to the gods and
share the victim with them without meeting face to face. According to Greek
custom, the ﬂesh and offal of the victims would be eaten after the sacriﬁce while
their bones would be wrapped in fat and burned on the altar for the gods. To explain
this arrangement, which seems to work to the disadvantage of the gods, Hesiod
offers the following story. When the gods and mortals had quarrelled over the matter
in the earliest times at Mekone (later Sicyon), Prometheus, for some unexplained
reason, settled the dispute to the advantage of mortals by working a deception on
Zeus. He killed an ox, cut it up, and separated the ﬂesh and entrails from the bones;
and he then covered the ﬂesh and entrails with the ox’s stomach to make that portion
look unappetizing, and concealed the bones under a layer of shining fat. Although
the poet tries to safeguard the wisdom of Zeus by saying that he was not really
fooled, we are told that Zeus reached for the more appealing portion in any case,
condemning the gods to receive the worse share at animal sacriﬁces ever after-
wards.152
Zeus was so angered by the deception that he withheld the gift of ﬁre from the
race of mortals. But Prometheus came to their aid once again by stealing some ﬁre
from heaven in the dry, pithy stalk of a fennel-plant (narthex, i.e. ferula communis, a
relative of the British cow-parsley whose stems contain a slow-burning white pith).
Zeus responded to this second provocation by imposing a second punishment on
mortal men (for there were no women as yet) and by consigning Prometheus to
everlasting torment. As man’s price for the stolen ﬁre, Zeus arranged for the creation
of a ‘beautiful evil’ (kalon kakon), the ﬁrst woman. Hephaistos fashioned her from
moistened earth at Zeus’ order, and Athena clothed her in silvery robes and an
embroidered veil, and adorned her with garlands and a golden crown of Hephaistos’
workmanship. She was then brought before an assembly of men and gods, who
wondered at the sight of her, realizing that she would be an irresistible snare for
men. In the present account from the Theogony, in which the ﬁrst woman is left
unnamed, Hesiod says nothing about her subsequent life, but simply expatiates 
with some ardour on the miseries that women and marriage have brought to men
ever since. To avoid marriage brings no beneﬁt either, since Zeus has also ensured
that men who do so will face a miserable old age.153 As for Prometheus, Zeus had
him bound to a pillar with unbreakable bonds, and sent an eagle against him each
day to gnaw at his liver, which grew afresh each night. Although he was eventu-
ally released from this speciﬁc torment when Herakles shot the eagle (see p. 271),
an exploit that was permitted by Zeus because it would bring glory to his son, there
is no suggestion that Prometheus was freed from his bonds as in most later
accounts.154
Hesiod offers a more detailed account of the myth of the ﬁrst woman in his Works
and Days. The centre of interest in this version is rather different, since the poet is

primarily concerned to explain why men live a life of toil after the life of ease that
they were supposed to have enjoyed in the earliest times (see p. 69), when a day’s
work would have been sufﬁcient to provide for a whole year. Prometheus and his
benefactions were to blame as in the Theogony, for he angered Zeus by deceiving
him (presumably over the sacriﬁces, although this is not stated), provoking him to
hide away ﬁre; and when he then stole some ﬁre for the beneﬁt of mortals, Zeus
sent the ﬁrst woman to bring trouble to men.155 At the bidding of Zeus, Hephaistos
mixed some earth and water together to fashion a young woman who was as beautiful

as the immortal goddesses. Athena dressed and adorned her, and taught her needle-
work and weaving; Aphrodite bestowed grace and allure on her; the Charites (Graces)
and Peitho (as the personiﬁcation of amorous persuasion) decked her with jewellery;
the Horai (Seasons) crowned her with spring ﬂowers; and Hermes ﬁnally taught her
all manner of guile and deceit, and granted her the gift of speech. He named her
PANDORA (pan, all, do¯ra, gifts) because all the Olympians were presenting her to
men as a gift and afﬂiction.156 Zeus now ordered Hermes to take her to Epimetheus
(Afterthought), the foolish brother of Prometheus, who accepted her as a wife 
even though he had been warned by Prometheus never to accept a gift from Zeus
lest it should bring harm to men. Only afterwards, when it was too late, did he
understand what he had done.157 Rather strangely in view of the divine status of
Epimetheus, this marriage is the means by which Pandora is introduced into the
human race. The Theogony states likewise that Epimetheus brought harm to men by
accepting the woman from Zeus.158 It is stated in the later tradition that Pandora
bore him a daughter, Pyrrha, the ﬁrst woman to be born by natural process, who
married her cousin Deukalion (see p. 402).
After arriving among mortals, Pandora opened the lid of a great jar that she had
with her, causing a host of evils and diseases to be released among mortals for the
ﬁrst time; for until that moment, men had lived on the earth free from toil and
sickness and other ills. Hesiod says nothing about the origin of the jar; presumably
she had brought it with her from the gods. Through the will of Zeus, she replaced
the lid of the jar before Elpis (Hope) could ﬂy out. Even if the narrative is not
entirely logical at this point (for Hope should properly have been allowed out with
all the evils if she was to live among mortals), this surely means that hope is to be
reserved for mortals as a palliative.159 This motif of the jar of evils was presumably
borrowed from fable or folklore; a related notion can be found in the Iliad, 
which states that Zeus possesses two urns from which he can dispense ills or bless-
ings to mortals.160
For signiﬁcant developments in the mythology of Prometheus, we have to wait
until the Prometheus Bound, a tragedy of the ﬁfth century BC that is ascribed to
Aeschylus (but may have been wholly or partially of different authorship). The drama
begins as Kratos and Bia (Might and Force), two ruthless agents of Zeus, bring
Prometheus forward to be chained to a rock at some unspeciﬁed place in the far
north (apparently not the Caucasus). Hephaistos has accompanied them to provide
his services as a blacksmith, although he is far from enthusiastic about the task or
about Zeus’s manner of rule.161 The immediate cause of Prometheus’ punishment
is his theft of ﬁre as in Hesiod’s version,162 but we learn in the course of the play
(which contains very little action) that he has brought many other beneﬁts to mortals,
and that at one time he has even saved them from being destroyed by a tyrannical
Zeus who grudges their very existence. For although Prometheus (who is here
described as a son of Gaia) had helped Zeus to power by advising him on how to
defeat the Titans, he later fell out with him when Zeus not only ignored the inter-
ests of human beings after his rise to power, but wanted to eliminate them to replace
them with a new race.163 By daring to oppose his intent and champion the inter-
ests of mortals, Prometheus won the enduring hostility of Zeus, and subsequently
compounded the offence by conferring all kinds of beneﬁts on human beings.

He taught them how to make houses from bricks and wood, to submit animals to
the yoke and bridle, to cross the seas on sailing ships, and to read the heavens so
as to be able to reap and sow at the right seasons; he invented the art of number
for them, moreover, and writing and medicine, and the interpretation of dreams
and omens, and the mining of the treasures of the earth; in short, he introduced or
invented all the arts that raise human beings from a state of nature.164 Hesiod’s
story of his deception over the sacriﬁces is conspicuously absent. Although Zeus had
the power to exact a cruel revenge, Prometheus had the advantage over Zeus in one
crucial respect, that his mother had told him that if Zeus fathered a child by a
certain mother (i.e. Thetis, see p. 52), she would bear him a son who would be
more powerful than his father.165 Knowing that Prometheus was in possession of
such a secret, Zeus sent Hermes to him after he was enchained to force him to reveal
it; but he remained deﬁant in the face of every threat, and the Prometheus Bound
ends with him being hurled down to Tartaros.166
This play was apparently the ﬁrst in a trilogy of which the second and third plays
were the Prometheus Unbound and Prometheus the Fire-bringer (unless the latter was the
ﬁrst in the series). The action of the Prometheus Unbound was set in the mountains
of the Caucasus, where Prometheus was now tied down and was suffering the painful
attentions of the above-mentioned eagle; and since the chorus was formed from his
fellow Titans (who are mentioned in the Prometheus Bound as being in Tartaros), it
would seem that they had been released from Tartaros along with Prometheus
himself. Herakles arrived at some stage and shot the eagle, as in the old account
by Hesiod; and he then proceeded to release Prometheus from his chains, as is indi-
cated in the title of the play. Prometheus must have appeased Zeus in the course
of the play by revealing that Thetis was the goddess who was fated to bear a son
who would surpass his father; but since he had been so stubborn in refusing to
reveal the secret in the previous play, his change of heart was presumably motivated
by something more than self-interest alone. It could well be that Zeus, who is a
brutal tyrant in the Prometheus Bound, agreed to change his ways.167 It was commonly
accepted in the subsequent tradition that Prometheus was set free by Herakles, and
also that the Caucasus was the site of his punishment.168
It was often said that Prometheus was not merely the benefactor of the human
race, but the ancestor of part or all of it, or even its creator. According to a genealogy
which ﬁrst appears in the Hesiodic Catalogue, he and his brother Epimetheus fathered
Deukalion and Pyrrha respectively, who formed the ﬁrst couple in the Central Greek
tradition (see p. 403).169 Since both of the relevant sources are corrupt, we cannot
tell who was named as Deukalion’s mother in the Catalogue. The Prometheus Bound
and Acusilaus agree that Prometheus was married to an Okeanid called Hesione
(although Herodotus identiﬁes his wife as Asia, who is his mother in the Theogony,
and various other names are suggested in later sources).170 The idea that Prometheus
created the ﬁrst human beings by moulding them from clay ﬁrst appears in the
Hellenistic period;171 this would at least explain why he should have wished to act
as their champion. According to a local tradition at Panopeus in Phocis, two clay-
coloured rocks that could be seen there were formed from the clay that was left over
when Prometheus had created the human race, hence their remarkable smell, which
resembled that of human ﬂesh.172
— The rise of Zeus and revolts against his rule —
96

It has been plausibly suggested that Prometheus originated as a trickster ﬁgure
of non-moral character who liked to pit his wits against those of Zeus, and that
because he was sometimes represented as tricking Zeus to the advantage of human
beings, he came to acquire a new and distinctive moral role as their benefactor and
defender.
Prometheus was honoured in cult at Athens in particular, as a patron of the arts
of ﬁre that were so important to that city; he was thought to preside over pottery
above all, while Hephaistos (another god who was especially honoured at Athens,
see p. 165) presided over metal-work. Torch races were held in his honour at his
Athenian festival of the Prometheia, and there was an altar to him as Fire-bringer
(Pyrphoros) at the Academy.173

THE BROTHERS AND 
SISTERS OF ZEUS

Z
eus had two brothers, Poseidon and Hades, who exercised supreme power within
their own realms, and three sisters, his wife and queen Hera, and Demeter and
Hestia. These other children of Kronos and Rhea will form the subject of the present
chapter, along with the mythology of the Underworld and afterlife. When the world
was divided between Zeus and his brothers after the defeat of the Titans (see 
p. 76), Poseidon and Hades were allotted realms of their own, the seas and the
Underworld respectively, and so acquired sovereign status within their speciﬁc
domains, even if Zeus retained ultimate power as the king of the gods. Zeus also had
his special domain, of course, as the lord of the heavens. Through the possession of
these separate kingdoms, the gods of this older generation are set apart from the
younger Olympian gods, who have no comparable domains. Since Hades withdrew to
his subterranean realm after receiving it in the draw and rarely left it thereafter, he
led an isolated existence, having little to do with his fellow gods or the world of the
living. The activities of Poseidon, by contrast, were by no means conﬁned to the sea,
nor did his functions as the god of that realm set him apart from the common world
of gods and mortals. In their images, Poseidon and Hades bear a considerable resem-
blance to Zeus himself, as mature bearded men of severe and majestic aspect. As
regards the sisters of Zeus, we have already encountered Hera as his consort, and
Demeter as an early wife or mistress of his who bore Persephone to him. Most of 
the major myths of Hera, the goddess of marriage, relate to her marriage to Zeus in
one way or another, while the main myth of the corn-goddess Demeter brings her 
into conﬂict with her brother Hades when he abducts her beloved daughter to pro-
vide himself with a wife. The least conspicuous member of the family, Hestia, was
the virgin goddess of the hearth; although honoured quite highly in cult, she was 
too homebound to have any memorable adventures.
POSEIDON, THE LORD OF THE SEAS AND THE
EARTHQUAKE
In accordance with the above-mentioned division of authority, POSEIDON shared
power with Zeus in the upper world as the lord of the seas; and he was also the god

of earthquakes and horses. A formidable deity who presided over violent forces of
nature, he was a simpler ﬁgure than his brother, and one who was much less open
to change and development as moral and theological ideas advanced. Perhaps the
most likely etymology of his name is the one that presents it as meaning ‘Husband
of Earth’, on the assumption that the second element in it, -da- , is an ancient name
of the earth-goddess; this is far from certain, however, and other etymologies have
been proposed that would link Poseidon’s name to the seas or waters. Whatever the
origin of his name, he was a very ancient Hellenic deity whose name appears on
Mycenaean tablets from Pylos and Knossos; at Pylos indeed, on the Messenian coast,
he was apparently the principal god, of greater importance even than Zeus. Although
he is represented above all as the great god of the seas in Homeric epic and the
subsequent tradition, this can hardly reﬂect his original nature if he was brought
to Greece by the Hellenes, since they came from far inland and had no acquain-
tance with the sea until they arrived in their ﬁnal home. It would seem that his
character must have undergone considerable change in early times as he was devel-
oped into a sea-god and then specialized in that function; but the course of that
process is now impossible to trace, unless by way of speculation. Accounts of him
from the literary record follow the pattern set by Homer, who portrays him in his
familiar guise as the majestic and intimidating monarch of the sea, repeatedly rising
from, plunging into or journeying over his allotted realm, and stirring its waters
to wreck his enemy Odysseus. In art, he is shown as a tall, mature and stately ﬁgure,
not unlike Zeus in general appearance, but distinguished by his emblem, the trident,
and by his wilder and more uncouth appearance, a feature that is emphasised in
Hellenistic art especially. The Romans, for want of a better equivalent (for they
originally had no maritime gods whatsoever), equated him with a rather obscure
water-deity, Neptunus, anglicized into Neptune.
If Hades was sometimes described as ‘another Zeus’, the same could be said of
Poseidon, who was the Zeus of the sea. He lived in a golden palace under the sea
at Aigai,1 off the island of Samothrace. His main attribute was his long-handled
three-pronged trident, which served both as a sceptre and as a weapon; originally a
humble ﬁsherman’s harpoon, it became a fearsome implement in his hands. He could
use it to stir up the sea and calm it down again, or to split rocks, as when he caused
the lesser Aias to be cast into the sea (see p. 485), or to reorder the topography of
the earth, as when he created the Vale of Tempe in Thessaly.2 Pindar and Aeschylus
liken it to the thunderbolt of Zeus.3 When he passed in procession through the sea,
he would be attended by sea-nymphs and the beasts and monsters of the deep. In
the Hellenistic and Roman periods, his sea-passage and marriage-procession became
a favourite subject with artists, who liked to portray him in the company of Tritons
(see p. 106), dolphins and Hippocamps (Hippokampoi, monsters with the fore parts
of a horse and the hind parts of a ﬁsh); the latter sometimes draw Poseidon’s chariot
or even carry him on their back. The splendour of his progress is vividly evoked in
the Iliad, in a famous passage which describes how he set off through the sea after
descending from the highest peak of Samothrace:
thrice he strode forward, and with the fourth stride reached his goal, Aigai,
where his glorious palace was built in the depths of the sea, golden and

resplendent, imperishable forever; there he went, and harnessed a pair of
bronze-hooved horses to his chariot . . . and drove out over the waves. The
monsters of the sea gambolled beneath him on every side; and the sea parted
before him in joy as his horses ﬂew swiftly onward, and the bronze chariot-
axle below was not even wetted.4
The main features of Poseidon’s activity are summarized succinctly in the little
Homeric Hymn to Poseidon. After referring to him as the great god of the deep 
who is ‘the stirrer of the earth and of the barren sea’, the poem goes on to say that
the gods have allotted a twofold ofﬁce to the Earthshaker, to be a tamer of horses
and saviour of ships.5 As this would indicate, the might of Poseidon, whether to
protect or destroy, was manifested above all in the power that he exercised over 
the elemental forces of nature. In his main sphere as a sea-god, he was far more 
a god of the stormy waters than of the sea at rest; and on land, he was the god of
the earthquake, as the Homeric epics already acknowledge by referring to him 
as the Earthshaker6 (Enosichthon; his titles of Seisichthon and Ennosigaios carry 
the same meaning). Any violent storm at sea could be attributed to his work. This
is another aspect of Poseidon that is vividly portrayed by Homer, in his account 
of the god’s persecution of Odysseus in the Odyssey. On one notable occasion, 
when Poseidon saw the hero at sea on a self-constructed raft (after leaving Kalypso’s
island see p. 497), he ‘marshalled the clouds and, grasping his trident in his 
hands, stirred up the sea; and he roused the storm-blasts of every kind of wind, and
enveloped the land and sea alike in cloud; darkness came rushing down from the
sky, and the East Wind and the South and the tempestuous West Wind and heaven-
born North Wind all dashed together as one, causing a great wave to come rolling
forward; and then the knees of Odysseus quivered, and his heart within him’.7
If he could send storms, he could also protect sailors and ﬁshermen from the 
perils of the sea if properly propitiated; it would be wise to invoke his aid before
setting out on a voyage. He could also stir up the sea to the beneﬁt of his worship-
pers, as when a sea-storm destroyed a substantial portion of the Persian ﬂeet off
Thessaly in 480 BC. On hearing of this event, the Greeks paid credit where it was
due by pouring libations to Poseidon and founding the new cult of Poseidon 
Soter (the Saviour) in his honour.8 Just as he would stir the sea to its depths 
if he so willed, he would also stir the earth to its depths as lord of the earthquake. 
In such circumstances, the Greeks would know who to blame or appease. When
Sparta, which was particularly prone to earthquakes, was struck by a severe earth-
quake in 464 BC, the Spartans interpreted this as Poseidon’s retribution for an act
of sacrilege that they had committed not long before, by expelling and killing 
some helots (serfs) who had sought sanctuary in a temple of Poseidon.9 He might
be appeased in time of earthquake if sacriﬁces were vowed to him as Poseidon
Asphaleios, in the hope that he would hold the ground ﬁrm (asphalos), or hymns
were addressed to him.10 As a chthonian deity, he also performed a gentler and 
more useful function by causing springs to rise up from the earth. He is some-
times presented as creating them with a blow of his trident, as in the case of the
salt-spring on the Athenian Acropolis (see below) or the spring of Amymone in
Argos (see p. 235).

Poseidon as god of horses
Another feature of Poseidon that is singled out for mention in the Homeric Hymn
cited above is his function as god of horses.11 Although he was also connected with
bulls to some extent, receiving them in sacriﬁce and sometimes sending them up
from the sea in myth (as for Minos, see p. 338), his connection with horses was
especially close in both myth and cult. This seems appropriate for a variety of reasons,
whether because the horse represented one of the most powerful forces of nature
that human beings could dominate, or because horses had chthonic associations, 
or because they were often credited with the creation of springs in Greek folklore.
It is worth noting, however, that the Greeks did not use horse metaphors (as in the
case of our ‘white horses’) to describe the waves and roaring of the sea; Poseidon’s
connection with horses was probably very ancient, perhaps even more ancient than
his connection with the sea. He was widely worshipped as Poseidon Hippios (the
Lord of Horses), horses played a prominent part in his cult, and legend even
presented him as the father of the ﬁrst horse. Horses were sacriﬁced to him and
kept at his sanctuaries, and chariot races were held in his honour at some of his
festivals; and charioteers would invoke his aid before a race, much like sailors at
sea. The Homeric Hymn to Apollo refers to an unusual rite at Onchestos in which
charioteers would jump from their chariot after whipping up their horses, and pray
for protection from Poseidon in the future if the chariot was wrecked in an adjoining
grove (which would have been sacred to the god).12 But our main concern must be
the myths that connect Poseidon with horses and the origin of the equine race.
In heroic myth, his sons Pelias and Neleus (see p. 380) and Hippothoon (see 
p. 344) are said to have been suckled by mares, and he is said to have given winged
or wondrous horses to Idas and to his favourite Pelops to help them win their brides
(see pp. 153 and 503). His most interesting horse-myths, however, are legends of
a more primitive nature which tell how he was supposed to have fathered notable
wonder-horses or indeed the ﬁrst horse of all. According to Hesiod, as we have 
seen (see p. 60), he once slept with the monstrous Medusa, causing her to conceive
the winged horse Pegasos, who sprang out of her body (along with Chrysaor) 
after Perseus cut off her head; and a legend that is no less extraordinary tells how
he came to father Areion, the divine horse of Adrastos, by mating with Demeter
while the pair of them were in horse-form. As recounted at Thelpousa in Arcadia,
where the goddess was honoured as Demeter Erinys, the myth ran as follows. 
While Demeter was wandering through the world in search of her lost daughter
(see pp. 126ff), Poseidon stalked her in the hope of making love to her; and when
she tried to escape him by turning herself into a mare and mingling with some
horses outside Thelpousa, he assumed the form of a stallion and had intercourse
with her. The products of this union were the divine horse Areion or Arion (whose
name probably meant ‘very swift’) and a daughter whose name could be revealed to
initiates alone. It was claimed that Demeter had acquired her local title of Erinys
(Fury) because she ‘had been enraged’ at Poseidon’s treatment of her (for the verb
erineuein could carry that meaning, i.e. to rage like a Fury). To explain why she was
also honoured there as Demeter Lousia (Washing Demeter), it was added that she
had washed in the river Ladon after the encounter.13

Areion was famous in legend from early epic onwards as the horse that carried Adrastos, 
king of Argos, to safety after his disastrous attack on Thebes (see p. 321). Some claimed 
that Areion was previously owned by Herakles, who had acquired him from Onkos, king of
Thelpousa (or from Kopreus, king of Haliartos near Tilphousa), and later passed him on to
Adrastos.14 There were alternative accounts in which Poseidon fathered Areion by an Erinys
near the spring of Tilphousa (see p. 144) in Boeotia, or by a Harpy.15 The myth of Poseidon’s
horse-mating with Demeter was also recounted at Phigaleia in Arcadia, where Demeter 
was represented as horse-headed and black in colour; but the only child of the union in the
Phigaleian tradition was the unnameable daughter mentioned above, whose public title among
the Arcadians was Despoina (the Mistress, also a title of Kore/Persephone).16 The cult of
Poseidon Hippios (Lord of Horses) was especially prominent in Arcadia. According to an
Arcadian tradition, Rhea saved Poseidon from being swallowed at birth by Kronos by hiding
him in a sheepfold near Mantineia (hence the name of a local spring called Arne or ‘Lamb-
spring’), and giving her husband a foal to swallow instead, on the pretext that their son had
been born as a horse.17
A legend from Thessaly in the north-east, which was a centre for the breeding of
horses, represented Poseidon as the progenitor of the entire equine race. For when
he had once been lying asleep in that land (where he was honoured under the title
of Petraios, ‘he of the rock’), he had shed some of his semen on to the rocky ground,
fertilizing the earth and causing it to bring forth the ﬁrst horse, Skyphios. Or in
some later accounts, he caused that earth to bring forth Skyphios (and Areion too
in one version) by striking the ground with his trident.18 Or in secondary versions
that were developed at Athens, Poseidon fertilized the ground at Kolonos just outside
the city to produce the ﬁrst horse, here called Skeironites, or else caused it to spring
from the ground with a blow of his trident while competing with Athena for posses-
sion of Attica.19
Myths in which Poseidon competes with other deities for 
possession of Greek lands
Some of the most interesting and distinctive of Poseidon’s stories are the local
legends that tell how he competed with other deities to gain possession of various
lands (i.e. to be adopted as the patron-deity of those lands). In the most famous by
far, he competed with Athena for the possession of Attica in a contest that was
judged by the Twelve Gods, or by the king of Athens, or its citizens. On arriving
ﬁrst in the land, Poseidon tried to establish his priority by striking the Acropolis
with his trident to create a salt-water well, the so-called ‘sea’ of the Erechtheion
(which lay inside the temple, and is said to have produced a sound resembling that
of waves whenever the wind blew from the south). Athena arrived next and staked
her claim by planting the ﬁrst of Attica’s many olive-trees, calling on Kekrops, the
ﬁrst king of Athens, to act as her witness. When Zeus referred the dispute to the
Twelve Gods for arbitration, they judged in favour of Athena after hearing the testi-
mony of Kekrops, apparently reaching this decision because they set greater store
on the value of Athena’s gift (which would be a mainstay of the economy) than on
the question of priority. Poseidon was so enraged that he ﬂooded the Thriasian Plain
to the north-west of Athens, for a time at least; or else he planned to ﬂood the
— The brothers and sisters of Zeus —
102

entire land until Hermes arrived with a message from Zeus ordering him to desist.20
The details of the story differ considerably in different accounts. Poseidon stakes his
claim in one version, for instance, by causing the ﬁrst horse to spring forth;21 or
Athena caused the olive-tree to spring up by striking the ground with her spear,22
just as Poseidon created the ‘sea’ by striking the Acropolis with his trident; or with
regard to the arbitration, Zeus himself acted as judge, or else Kekrops himself, 
or his son Erysichthon.23 In a curious rationalistic account recorded by Varro, the
Delphic oracle advised the people of Athens to decide between the two deities 
after an olive and some water had sprung forth as their symbols, and the male
citizens (who all voted for the male god) were outvoted by the female citizens (who
all voted for the goddess) because the women outnumbered the men by one.24
Although Athena became the main god of Athens, a reconciliation could be said to
have been reached since Poseidon was much worshipped there under various titles,
enjoying a cult on the Acropolis itself as Poseidon Erechtheus (a title that links him
to the mythical king Erechtheus, see p. 369). As we know from Pausanias, the ‘sea’
that he had created could still be seen in the time of Hadrian, as could Athena’s
olive-tree, which had miraculously regrown, sending up a long shoot within a single
day, after the Persians had destroyed it while burning the sanctuaries on the
Acropolis in 480 BC.25
Hera was said to have established her position as the great goddess of Argos
through another such contest, which was judged by Phoroneus, the ﬁrst king of the
land (see p. 227), with the aid of three local river-gods, Inachos, Kephisos and
Asterion; Phoroneus awarded the land to Hera, much to the anger of Poseidon, 
who retaliated by causing the rivers of the Argolid to run dry for much of the year.26
He made partial amends later, however, by creating an ever-running spring at Lerna
for one of the daughters of Danaos (see p. 235). According to an Argive cultic
legend, Poseidon drowned much of the land in his wrath until Hera interceded to
cause him to withdraw the ﬂood, hence the origin of the sanctuary of Poseidon
Proklystios (‘he who dashes with waves’, i.e. the Flooder) in Argos, which had
supposedly been raised at the place from where the sea-ﬂood had receded.27 In similar
contests set in the Greek islands, Poseidon had lost Naxos to Dionysos and Aegina
to Zeus.28 On two other occasions, however, compromises were proposed. When
Poseidon competed with Athena to become the lord of Troizen, Zeus ordered the
two of them to share the land, and they presided over it jointly ever afterwards,
Poseidon under the title of Basileus (King) and Athena as Polias (Protector of the
City) and Sthenias (the Mighty).29 The Troizenians had a ﬂood-story which bears
some resemblance to that at Argos (although there is no indication that it was
connected with a contest for the land), for it was said that Poseidon had once ﬂooded
the land, making it unfruitful with his salt-waters, until he had yielded to the
prayers and sacriﬁces of the Troizenians, who worshipped him thereafter outside the
city walls under the further title of Phytalmios (Fosterer of Growth).30 In another
contest set at Corinth, a compromise was proposed by the arbitrator, Briareos (one
of the Hundred-Handers, see p. 67), who decided to award the Isthmus of Corinth
to Poseidon but the acropolis of the city to Helios.31 As to the signiﬁcance of these
various stories, it would certainly be wrong to attempt to interpret them in a simple
historical sense, as if they reﬂected cultic conﬂicts in the distant past; it would seem,

rather, that they express something about Poseidon himself and his place in the
city, as an awesome and threatening deity who is highly honoured though not as a
patron god.
Poseidon is quite prominent in the Iliad, which depicts him as a violent partisan who does
everything possible from ﬁrst to last to help the Greeks and harm the Trojans. He had
reason enough to be hostile to Troy, since Laomedon, the father of Priam, had employed
him and Apollo to build the walls of the city, but had insulted them and refused to pay
them when they had completed the task (see p. 523).32 When the Greeks built a wall to
protect their ships, he complained at the assembly of the gods, saying that the fame of this
new wall would overshadow that of the wall that he and Apollo had built;33 but he inter-
vened to rally the Greeks when the Trojans broke through to attack the ships, helping to
turn the tide of the battle until Zeus ordered him to desist.34 Although Poseidon plays a
more restricted role in the Odyssey, his hostility to the main hero is a central motif of the
poem. He was so angry with Odysseus for having blinded the Kyklops Polyphemos, who
was a son of his, that he delayed the hero’s return for many years and ﬁnally caused him to
be cast adrift in the sea by means of the great storm described above35 (although he survived
to be washed ashore on the island of the Phaeacians, see p. 497); and Poseidon also punished
the Phaeacians for sending Odysseus home in one of their magical ships.36 In a later epic
in the Trojan cycle, he caused part of the Greek ﬂeet to be wrecked during its return voyage
(to help Athena to avenge a grave act of sacrilege, see p. 485). He makes fewer appearances
than one might expect in heroic mythology from later sources, being mentioned mainly in
connection with his mortal children and the stories of their conception. Other characteristic
tales tell how he sent bulls or monsters up from the sea as a bane or beneﬁt to mortals. He
sent up a bull as a favour for Minos, though with disastrous consequences in the long 
run (see pp. 338ff), and another at the request of Theseus to cause the death of Hippolytos
(see p. 358); and to punish the presumption of Laomedon and of the mother of Andromeda,
he sent sea-monsters against their lands (see pp. 240 and 523).
Poseidon’s consort Amphitrite and his children by her 
and other mothers
AMPHITRITE, the consort of Poseidon, was generally thought to have been a
daughter of Nereus (although an alternative tradition presented her as a daughter 
of Okeanos, and it is stated in one source that she was the mother of the Nereids).37
She was a reluctant bride as was commonly the case with the Nereids, who preferred
to live a carefree life as virgins in the company of their parents and many sisters.
According to one account, Poseidon abducted her from the island of Naxos after she
had emerged from the sea to dance on the shore with her sisters;38 or else she ﬂed 
from him when he tried to court her, and hid herself in the depths of the Ocean near
Atlas (i.e. in the far west). In the latter case, Poseidon sent many envoys in search of
her, including his special beast the dolphin, who discovered her in the outer Ocean
and carried her to Poseidon on its back (or at least let him know where she was
hiding). The god was so grateful that he declared the dolphin sacred and placed an
image of it among the stars (as the northern constellation Delphinus).39 After ﬁnally
becoming the wife of Poseidon, Amphitrite lived at his side in his golden palace
beneath the sea, enjoying high honour as the queen of the seas. Although she is
depicted quite frequently in works of art as a goddess of noble aspect, often enthroned
— The brothers and sisters of Zeus —
104

beside her husband, she rarely appears in mythical tales. According to a fairly ancient
legend, she offered a gracious reception to Theseus (here regarded as a son of Poseidon)
when he threw himself off a ship to prove to Minos that he was a son of the god of
the sea (see pp. 345–6); and a story of later origin claimed that she caused Skylla to
be turned into a monster after discovering that her husband had embarked on a love
affair with her (see p. 497). Poseidon and Amphitrite are credited with only a single
child in the Theogony, the sea-god Triton, ‘who holds the depths of the sea and lives
with his mother and the lord his father, a fearsome god’.40
Apollodorus adds two daughters, Benthesikyme (Wave of the Deep) and Rhode, the nymph
or personiﬁcation of the island of Rhodes.41 Rhode or Rhodos became the consort of the
sun-god Helios, whose cult was especially prominent on Rhodes (see p. 43); conﬂicting
accounts were offered of her birth. Benthesikyme is remembered solely as the foster-mother
of Eumolpos (see p. 370).42
Nothing is known for certain about the meaning and origin of the names of
Amphitrite and Triton, although it is possible that the common trito element (which
is also to be found in Athena’s ancient title of Tritogeneia, see p. 182) may have

had something to do with water or the sea. TRITON was pictured as a merman
with a human head and upper body and a ﬁshtail. Greek sea-beings of this type
probably originated in the native tradition as products of the popular imagination,
even if representations of them may sometimes have been inﬂuenced by images of
biform deities from the east. Although Triton is presented as a sea-god of some
dignity in the passage quoted from the Theogony, he makes no signiﬁcant appear-
ance in conventional mythology except in his speciﬁc role as the god of Lake Tritonis 
in Libya. According to a tale of quite early origin which was known to Pindar and
Herodotus,43 he appeared to the Argonauts when they became trapped in the lake
during their return voyage, and not only showed them the way to the open sea, 
but gave one of them a clod of earth from which the island of Thera would grow
(see further on pp. 396–7). To explain Athena’s title of Tritogeneia, some claimed
that the goddess had been reared by Triton in Libya (see p. 182). This god of the
lake was presumably a local deity who came to be identiﬁed with the Greek god.
In vase-paintings from the sixth century BC, Herakles can be seen wrestling with
Triton (rather than Nereus in all surviving literary accounts) to force him to reveal
the way to the Hesperides (see p. 269; or perhaps to the island of Geryoneus). There
are otherwise various tales from Latin sources that refer to Triton’s favourite pastime
of blowing on the conch-shell horn, an instrument that is his familiar attribute in
works of art. Vergil tells how Misenus, a skilled trumpeter who accompanied Aeneas
to Italy, was drowned by Triton for his presumption in challenging the gods to
compete with him in blowing the conch-shell horn;44
and in other 
tales, he is said to have induced panic in the Giants during their battle with the
gods by blowing on his horn, and to have blown his horn after the great ﬂood at
the bidding of Zeus to recall the waters to their proper courses.45
Although there was apparently only a single Triton in the earliest tradition, his
name came to be applied in a more general sense to an entire race of ﬁshtailed sea-
beings who accompanied Poseidon through the sea and sported with the Nereids.
These became a favourite subject with artists in Hellenistic Greece and eventually in
Italy too, especially for the decorative detail of sea-pieces; and female Tritons 
and Triton families came to be depicted, an idea foreign to early Greek tradition. As
nature-spirits of no very high status, the Tritons entered into folklore in much the
same way as mermaids in more recent times, and many stories would surely have been
transmitted about them among sailors and people of coastal communities. As so often,
we can refer to Pausanias for one or two local tales. Having seen two Tritons that were
preserved at Rome and at Tanagra on the Boeotian coast, Pausanias was able to offer
a precise description of their appearance, writing that they had green hair on their
head, gills behind their ears, greenish-grey eyes, a ﬁnely scaled body, and a dolphin’s
tail instead of legs and feet.46 There were two conﬂicting legends about the Tanagran
Triton, who was the larger of the two. In one account, he had attacked some local
women while they were bathing in the sea to purify themselves for the secret rites of
Dionysos, who immediately came to their aid and overcame their would-be ravisher
after a sharp ﬁght. Or in another version, the Triton had been causing such trouble
to the Tanagrans by seizing their cattle when they drove them down to the sea, or
even attacking small boats, that they set a trap for him by leaving a large bowl of wine
by the shore; and when he duly emerged from the sea, drained the wine, and fell asleep
— The brothers and sisters of Zeus —
106

in a drunken stupor, one of the Tanagrans was able to creep forward and chop off his
head with an axe. As proof of this latter detail, they could point to the headless state
of the Triton in their temple of Dionysos.47
After Zeus who fathered innumerable children by mortal mothers, Poseidon was
the god who is credited with the largest number of non-divine children. These can
be divided into two main groups. As a god who was notoriously wild and unpredict-
able, Poseidon was naturally regarded as a suitable father for heroes or giants of a
violent and uncouth nature; but as a great god who ranked second only to Zeus, he
was also introduced into heroic genealogies for much the same reasons as his brother,
to be enrolled as the divine founder of local royal lines, or as the divine father of
notable heroes without adverse judgement as to their character. His greatest son 
in the latter group was Theseus (at least in the tradition of his birthplace, see 
p. 342); Pelias and Neleus may also be cited (see p. 380 for the story of their concep-
tion), and Belos and Agenor, the founders of the two main branches of the Inachid
family (see p. 232). Others will be mentioned as they arise. Among his wild children
in the other group, we ﬁnd colourful and disreputable ﬁgures such as the Kyklops
Polyphemos (see p. 492), the giant hunter Orion (in one account at least, see p.
561), the Aloadai who tried to storm heaven (see p. 91), Amykos who killed passing
strangers in boxing-matches (see p. 386), the Athenian rapist Halirrhothios (see 
p. 365), and many of the rufﬁans who confronted Herakles (e.g. Antaios, see p. 270)
and Theseus (e.g. Skeiron and Sinis, see pp. 342ff) during their travels.
HADES AND THE MYTHOLOGY OF THE
UNDERWORLD
The grim lord of the Underworld
After winning the Underworld as his special domain when the world was divided
between him and his two brothers, HADES lived apart from the other gods and
had little to do with the affairs of the living. As the ruler of the dead, he was grim
and mournful in his character and functions alike, and severely just, and inexorable
in the performance of his duties. He acted in the manner of a jailer, ensuring that
dead mortals who entered his dark kingdom never escaped back to the light of the
sun; and his realm contained a place of punishment where some few who had gravely
offended the gods, or indeed the wicked in general according to later ideas, would
be subjected to torment or correction in the afterlife. But Hades was no enemy of
the human race, nor was he radically different in nature from his more fortunate
brothers; he was a terrible not a malevolent god.
The name of the lord of the Underworld appears in various different forms, as
Hades in its familiar Attic guise, or as Aïdes or Aïdoneus (or as Aidos and Aidi in
the genitive and dative only, probably from *Ais) in epic usage. The Greeks assumed
that Aïdes simply means ‘the Unseen’ or ‘Invisible’48 (a-ides; the a is privative like
‘un-’ in English), and they may well have been correct, although this remains an
open question; for some would argue, for instance, that the name is related to aia,
earth, instead. In classical usage, the name of Hades was not applied directly to his

realm, which was properly the abode or ‘house’ of Hades; in Greek, as an inﬂected
language, the distinction could be indicated by use of the genitive form of his name
without need of an accompanying noun. Since wealth comes from the depths of the
ground in the form of crops and minerals, the Greeks often referred to Hades under
the title of Plouton (the Wealthy or Wealth-giver), at least from the ﬁfth century
BC onwards. He acquired quite a variety of euphemistic titles, such as Polydegmon,
Polydektes or Polyxeinos (all meaning the receiver or host of many, and hence the
Hospitable), or Eubouleus (Wise in Counsel) or Klymenos (the Renowned), 
for the Greeks generally preferred not to speak directly of death in connection with
themselves or their friends, whether to avoid ill-omened remarks or to pass over
unpleasant realities. They would refer to Hades by such titles for much the same
reasons as they would say that someone had ‘departed’ (be¯be¯ken) or refer to the dead
person as the ‘blessed one’ (ho makariste¯s), or even begin such matter-of-fact docu-
ments as wills with the formula ‘All will go well; but if anything should happen,
I make the following dispositions’.49 As the absolute ruler of a realm that was set
apart from the rest of the world, Hades could also be called Zeus Katachthonios
(Zeus of the Underworld) or simply ‘the Other Zeus’.
Since the Romans had no death-god of their own, or had forgotten him if they
ever did have one, they took over the Greek name Plouton (Latinized to Pluto) as
their title for that deity, or else translated it by Dis, the contracted form of the
Latin word dives (wealth). The name of his consort was corrupted into Proserpina, 
and nothing was added to the existing mythology of either. Hades was worshipped
almost nowhere in Greece; in connection with his precinct and temple at Elis, 
which were opened on a single day in the year and were closed to all but the priest
even then, Pausanias remarks that he knows of no one else who worships him.50
There is mention, however, of a precinct of Hades at Triphylian Pylos (and it has
been argued that the Klymenos who had a temple at Hermione can be identiﬁed
with Hades).51 Dis and Proserpina were honoured in cult at Rome from the time
the Romans ﬁrst became acquainted with the Greek deities. Hades is represented
comparatively seldom in Greek art. When he is, he often carries a sceptre or key 
as a sign of his authority (or else a cornucopia in his nature as Plouton), and 
his form and features differ very little from those of Zeus, save in expression; 
Seneca describes the difference epigrammatically when he says of him vultus est 
illi Iouis, sed fulminantis, ‘he has the look of Jove himself, but of Jove when he 
thunders’.52
The gloomy land of the dead
It was commonly assumed, of course, that Hades’ kingdom lay somewhere far under-
ground. In such matters, however, consistency is not to be looked for in the traditions
of any people, and the Greeks were also inclined to place the abode of the dead in
the far west (as already noted, see p. 22), where the sun and other heavenly bodies
make their descent. Although both ideas can be found in the Homeric epics, they
are already fully reconciled, for Odysseus’ westward journey to the land of the dead53
is no more than a special means of approach to an underground realm. Except in a
— The brothers and sisters of Zeus —
108

passage in the ﬁnal book of the Odyssey which is almost certainly part of a later
interpolation,54 there is no suggestion in Homer that the shades of the dead have
to travel to the Underworld by such a route (or indeed have to seek any opening
in the ground). When the shade of the dead Patroklos departs after speaking to
Achilles in the Iliad, it vanishes away under the earth like smoke; and similarly,
when Patroklos and Hektor die, their soul simply ﬂits from their body and is gone
to Hades without more ado.55
The belief that the shades of the dead were able to pass directly below, or the
common belief of a somewhat later period that they were conducted below by
Hermes, did not preclude the development of local traditions in which people
claimed to have a cave, chasm or lake in their area which communicated with the
Underworld (much like the hellmouths of modern folklore). Since living mortals
who wanted to descend below as fully embodied beings would necessarily have to
seek an opening of this kind, these local hellmouths were drawn into myth as the
routes that were taken by great heroes of the past who visited Hades while still
alive, such as Herakles, Theseus and Orpheus. Herakles, for example, was supposed
to have found his way below through a bottomless cave at Tainaron in the southern
Peloponnese (see p. 268). Or in divine myth, Dionysos was said to have descended
through a bottomless lake at Lerna in the Argolid when he went to fetch his 
dead mother (see p. 171). Odysseus’ journey in the Odyssey took him into more
exotic regions. After sailing west over the outer Ocean toward the sunset, he arrived
at the mist-enshrouded land of the Kimmerians, a people who never see the light
of the sun. He beached his ship there and made his way to the boundary of the
Underworld, at a place where two infernal rivers met.56 Rather than venturing inside
the world of the dead, as did the heroes mentioned above, Odysseus encouraged the
dead to come to him by pouring libations to them and by sacriﬁcing a lamb and
ewe over a pit to provide blood for them to drink. As the ﬂuttering shades drank
from the blood, they recovered a measure of bodily consistency and sufﬁcient under-
standing to be able to converse with their visitor.57 Although Homer does not
attempt to describe the topography of the lower world, he alludes to its most distinc-
tive feature, the famous meadows of asphodel; for Odysseus sees the ghost of Achilles
striding off through an asphodel meadow, and sees the dead hunter Orion herding
ghostly beasts across it.58 Romantic though its name may sound in English, asphodel
is a dingy and unprepossessing plant which grows on barren ground, and we should
imagine this accordingly as a bleak monochrome landscape that provides a suitable
setting for the colourless half-life of the shades.
The abode of the dead is usually pictured as a gloomy subterranean land which
contains these meadows of asphodel and also, in many subsequent accounts, groves
and hills and other features of a conventional landscape. It is separated from 
the world of the living by a boundary-river, the Styx in the Iliad, but usually the
Acheron in later sources.59 Four infernal rivers are mentioned in the Odyssey, namely
the Styx, Acheron, Kokytos (here described as a branch of the Styx) and
Pyriphlegethon (also known as Phlegethon);60 and a ﬁfth river, Lethe, is added in
the subsequent tradition.61 Their names are signiﬁcant in every case, meaning respec-
tively the Abhorrent, the Woeful (if the name of Acheron can be rightly derived

from achos, woe, distress), the River of Lamentation, the Fiery, and the River of
Forgetfulness. The name of Pyriphlegethon had nothing to do originally with ﬁres
of punishment (although it is mentioned as a place of torment in occasional late
passages), but simply referred to the ﬂames of the funeral pyre. Acheron was some-
times said to have issued into a swampy lake or mere (Acherousia or the Acherousian
lake);62 its name was also used, by extension, as a poetic name for the Underworld.
Hesiod mentions the Styx alone, stating that it ﬂows down from the Ocean taking
a tenth of its water, and that the gods swear their solemn oaths by it (see further 
on p. 49).63
The Styx, Kokytos and Acheron had counterparts in the upper world, the Styx in Arcadia,
the Kokytos in Thesprotia in north-western Greece, and the Acheron in Thesprotia and 
elsewhere. There was a Styx in northern Arcadia that plunged several hundred feet down a
sheer cliff-face near Nonakris (at the falls now known as Mavronero), much as the infernal
river is said to ﬂow down from a tall precipice in Hesiod’s account. In the earliest surviving
reference to the Arcadian Styx, Herodotus mentions that the Arcadians swore oaths by it
and believed that waters from the infernal river issued into it.64 There is no way of telling
whether the traditional conception of the infernal river was inﬂuenced by knowledge of the
Arcadian Styx and its falls, or whether, conversely, the Arcadian Styx was ﬁrst given that
name because its chilly falls resembled those of the Styx in Hesiod’s description. It is no
surprise that the waters of the Arcadian river should have been credited with sinister qual-
ities. Pausanias reports, for instance, that they were reputed to bring death to animals and
human beings who drank from them, and to have the power to dissolve or corrupt almost
everything, including glass, crystal and agate, and even pottery; and a tradition claimed that
Alexander the Great was poisoned with some Styx-water that was sent over to Asia in a
horse’s hoof, the only substance unaffected by its powers.65 The Thesprotian Acheron was
also rendered impressive by its setting, for it ﬂowed through deep gorges in a wild land-
scape, occasionally disappearing underground, and passed through a marshy lake before
emerging into the Ionian Sea; it had an oracle of the dead beside it, as did another Acheron
near Heracleia Pontica in Asia Minor. There was also an Acheron is southern Elis.66
An allusion in Plato’s Republic provides the earliest evidence for Lethe as a river of the
Underworld. It is ﬁtting that waters of Forgetfulness should ﬂow through the Underworld
since it is a realm of oblivion where the shades of the dead can expect to forget all or most
of their earthly experiences. A poem by Theognis observes accordingly that Persephone brings
le¯the¯, forgetfulness, to mortals by impairing their wits, and Aristophanes refers to an infernal
plain of Lethe (which probably ﬁgured in Eleusinian eschatology).67 Once the idea had arisen
that waters of Lethe ﬂowed through the Underworld, it could easily be imagined that the
newly arrived dead would be deprived of their memory by drinking from them; and for
those who believed in reincarnation, a subsequent draught of Lethe could explain why souls
that have been reborn into earthly bodies remember nothing of the other world or of their
previous incarnations. It is in the latter connection that Plato refers to a river of Forgetfulness
(Amele¯ta potamon).68 As a further thought, it might be imagined that newly departed persons
who possessed the requisite knowledge might be able to abstain from drinking from the
waters of Lethe and so retain their full memory and understanding. Instructions on this 
very matter are provided on gold leaves that have been excavated from the tombs of Bacchic
initiates in southern Italy and elsewhere; on one such leaf from Hipponion on the heel of
Italy, dating to about 400 BC, the initiate is told to avoid a spring on the right-hand side
beneath a white cypress on entering Hades, but to drink instead from the cool waters 
that ﬂow from the lake of Mnemosyne (Memory).69 Although the spring that is to be avoided
— The brothers and sisters of Zeus —
110

is not explicitly named, it is evidently a spring of le¯the¯, forgetfulness. In ordinary life, 
people who wanted to consult the oracle of Trophonios at Lebadeia (see p. 559) would drink
from two neighbouring springs, ﬁrst from that of Lethe to clear their mind of all previous
thoughts, and then from that of Mnemosyne so as to be able to remember what the oracle
would reveal.70
From the time of Homer onwards, the gates of Hades are a regular feature of Under-
world imagery. In a battle-scene in the Iliad, for instance, Tlepolemos boasts 
that he will kill Sarpedon and cause him to ‘pass through the gates of Hades’; and
the lord of the Underworld is described in that epic as the ‘warder of the gates’
(pularte¯s).71 These gates could be pictured as forming the entrance to the ‘house

of Hades’ as the home of the dead was often called;72 and this body of imagery 
was well-suited to express how entry into the world of the dead was controlled 
and escape prevented. On the latter point, it will be sufﬁcient to quote some lines
from Hesiod:
There [i.e. in the nether regions] stand the echoing halls of mighty Hades,
god of the lower world, and of dread Persephone. A fearsome dog keeps piti-
less guard in front, and has a nasty trick: he fawns on all who enter with
wagging tail and both ears down, but he will not allow them to go out again,
no, he keeps a careful guard and devours anyone whom he catches trying to
go out through the gates of mighty Hades and dread Persephone.73
If the hell-hound Kerberos (see p. 62) guards the gates in this savage fashion, the
ever-righteous Aiakos (see p. 53) was sometimes said to act as door-keeper or keeper
of the keys.
How the dead passed below; their guide Hermes and 
ferryman Charon
We must now consider how the dead were supposed to make their way from this
world to the other. There is no mention of any ferryman of the dead in the Homeric
epics, and Hermes appears as escort of the shades in a single passage alone in the
ﬁnal book of the Odyssey. This passage describes him as guiding the shades of the
dead suitors of Penelope to the other world by much the same route as was followed
by Odysseus:
past the streams of Ocean they went, and past the White Rock, past the gates
of the Sun and the land of dreams, and quickly reached the meadows of aspho-
del, where is the dwelling-place of the shades, the phantoms of the departed.74
Hermes is not mentioned in this role again until the classical period when Aeschylus
speaks of him coming to fetch a dead heroine, Skylla, at the time of her death;75
and the earliest evidence from the visual arts takes us only a little further back, to
the end of the sixth century BC. There is in fact good reason to suppose that the
relevant passage in the Odyssey forms part of a later addition to the epic (as was
already argued by some scholars in antiquity); and if that is indeed the case, a consis-
tent pattern can be recognized in the Homeric epics in which the dead pass to
Hades of their own accord without need for a guide or ferryman. Since the shades
(psychai) are pictured as ﬂimsy beings who ﬂutter around like ghosts, it could easily
be imagined that they would be able to vanish beneath the earth ‘like smoke’ (as
does the shade of Patroklos after his visit to Achilles),76 and to ﬂit across the
boundary-river and any other barrier without any difﬁculty. The soul ﬂies off like
a dream and is gone, or it ﬂits out of the dead man’s body and departs to Hades
without more ado, bewailing its fate.77
In the Homeric account, however, the newly departed dead face one notable
restriction with regard to their passage, namely that they cannot join the society of
the dead until their earthly remains have been buried. When the shade of Patroklos
appears to Achilles, he begs him to
— The brothers and sisters of Zeus —
112

bury me as quickly as possible, so that I may pass through the gates of Hades;
the shades, the phantoms of the dead, are keeping me at bay, nor do they
allow me to join them beyond the river, but I must wander in vain along the
outside of the broad-gated house of Hades.78
And when Odysseus visits the borders of the Underworld in the Odyssey, the ﬁrst
shade to approach him is that of his dead comrade Elpenor, who complains that he
has been left unburied and appeals to his friend to rectify the matter, doubtless 
for the same reason as Patroklos.79 The evidence from tragedy and other sources
suggests that burial was no longer regarded as a precondition for entry to Hades by
the classical period; this change may well have come about because Hermes and
Charon were now thought to preside over the process by which the departed were
integrated into the world of the dead.
Charon, the ferryman of the dead, is ﬁrst mentioned in a fragment from the
Minyas,80 an early epic of uncertain date (probably sixth century BC or slightly 
earlier), and is depicted in vase-paintings from the end of the sixth century onwards.
There are differing views on his origin, some arguing that he was a very old ﬁgure
from popular belief, and others that he was a literary invention from the archaic
period, as is perhaps more likely. It is also difﬁcult to tell exactly when Hermes ﬁrst
acquired his role as conductor of the dead (psychopompos). By the ﬁfth century in any
case, the Homeric account of the passing of the dead had been displaced by another
in which Hermes guided the shades of the dead to the nether regions, and Charon
then ferried them across the boundary-river (usually Acheron, occasionally Styx) into
the world of the dead. As we have seen, Hermes is portrayed as conductor of the dead
in the present text of the Odyssey; but if it can be accepted that the relevant passage
forms part of a later addition to the epic (perhaps dating to the early sixth century),
it is reasonable to assume that this function was ﬁrst assigned to the god at some stage
in the archaic period. Although the immortals generally shunned all contact with
death and the dead, Hermes, as a god who was especially associated with boundaries
and their transgression (see p. 158), could be ﬁttingly imagined as a god who would
not shrink from crossing this most forbidding of boundaries, whether as psychopompos
or in his more ancient function as a messenger. In the Homeric Hymn to Demeter, for
instance, Zeus sends him below to ask Hades to return Persephone to the upper
world.81 On the exceptional occasions on which the dead were permitted to make
visits to the upper world, it was the duty of Hermes to escort them (as in the case of
Protesilaos for instance82). While acting as guide to the shades, Hermes did not lead
them into their ultimate home (except in the unusual account in the ﬁnal book of the
Odyssey), but took them down to the border of the land of the dead, leaving it for
Charon to convey them across the ﬁnal frontier.
CHARON is consistently represented as a formidable old man of unexceptional
appearance in the earliest images, but increasingly as ugly and squalid; for charac-
teristic literary portraits, Aristophanes’ Frogs, Vergil’s Aeneid and Lucian’s Dia-
logues of the Dead may be consulted.83 Vergil describes him as foul and repulsive,
with a tangle of unkempt white hair on his chin, and ﬁery eyes, and a ﬁlthy cloak
as his garment. Except in a doubtful reference that makes him a son of Akmon 
(a being who was sometimes named as the father of Ouranos, see p. 32), no 
genealogy is recorded for him; he should presumably be regarded as a daimon or

minor divinity. It is his duty to ensure that only those who are properly qualiﬁed
are allowed to pass into the world of the dead; his only proper myth states accord-
ingly that he was once thrown into chains for a year for ferrying over the living
Herakles (when the hero travelled below to fetch Kerberos, see p. 268).84 He never
displaces Kerberos, who will be encountered on the far side of the river, where
mortals who cross over while still alive might be able to pacify him by tossing him
a honey-cake (i.e. giving him a share of the food of the dead, for such cakes were
a very common form of offering). Since the ferryman of the dead could expect to
be rewarded for his services, the dead were buried with a small coin in their mouth,
Charon’s obol. In Etruscan tradition, Charun, as he is called in the local language,
is a demon of grim enough character who carries a heavy hammer to dispatch his
victims; and Charon survived into modern Greek folklore as a ﬁgure called Charos,
who is generally represented as riding a horse and carrying off young and old.
The ghosts who throng the Underworld are the merest shadows of living men
and women, lacking the essentials of real vigorous life. All that survives from the
living person is the tenuous psyche¯ or ‘breath-soul’, which departs from the body at
the time of death and ﬁnds its way into the company of the dead. The psyche¯, the
name of which is related to the Greek word for breathing (psychein), was not origin-
ally regarded as a centre of consciousness, let alone a soul in the Socratic-Platonic
and modern religious understanding; Homer never uses the term in connection with
the mental functions of the living, referring instead to an array of ‘faculties’ that
depend on the living body for their activity (such as the thymos, a sort of life-soul
or affective centre, the noos or understanding, and the phrenes, literally the midriff).
The psyche¯ by contrast is the departing breath and the wraith that takes over as a
continuation of the dead person’s self. It is as insubstantial as breath or smoke; but
it resembles the dead person in its outward appearance, and may thus be called an
eido¯lon or double. On the question of the level of consciousness of the departed
psychai, the Homeric epics are by no means consistent, for it is suggested at times
that they are wholly witless, while at other times they seem to possess some form
of conscious life, and thus to be capable of acting spontaneously (as would be neces-
sary if they were to prevent the unburied Patroklos from entering their company,
or to approach Odysseus to drink the blood that he had poured for them).85 This
is not of course an area in which perfect logic and consistency can be expected; the
discrepancy may perhaps be interpreted in terms of differing perspectives, for the
shades may be regarded as witless by comparison with embodied mortals, while they
yet must be supposed to possess some form of attenuated consciousness if they are
to be capable of forming a society of their own and communicating with one another.
It has also been argued that these are conﬂicting ideas of separate origin, and that
the inconsistency thus arises because different strata of belief are preserved side by
side in the Homeric epics.
Dead heroes and heroines who met with exceptional fates; the
privileged few in Elysion or the Isles of the Blessed
Since the dead are not subjected to any form of posthumous judgement in the
Homeric account, the mass of them share a common fate in the Underworld, living

together as gibbering shades, rather like bats in a cave. Although this would certainly
be a dispiriting prospect, the dying would have nothing positively dreadful to fear,
however they might have behaved in their previous life. Pindar and Aeschylus are 
the ﬁrst authors to refer to a general judgement of the dead that might assign indi-
viduals to a happier or worse fate in accordance with their merits. Aeschylus states
that sentence will be passed by ‘another Zeus’, that is to say Hades himself (as we may
also be supposed to infer from Pindar’s vague reference to an anonymous ‘some-
body’);86 but in the subsequent tradition from the time of Plato onwards, the task was
usually assigned to Minos and other dead heroes who had been renowned for their
justice during their earthly lives (see further on p. 122). Although Minos is already
portrayed in the Odyssey as dispensing justice to the shades with his golden sceptre in
hand,87 Homer clearly does not mean us to suppose that he is judging them for 
actions committed during their earthly lives; as a king among the dead, he is merely
continuing his characteristic activity in the afterlife, much as the dead hunter Orion
conducts a ghostly hunt (see p. 561). Only in a single connection, that of perjured
oaths, does Homer ever suggest the ordinary dead might be punished below for deeds
committed on this side of the grave. When Agamemnon is swearing an oath on one
occasion, he invokes Zeus and the Earth and Sun as his witnesses along with ‘the
Erinyes [Furies] who exact vengeance on men beneath the earth when any has sworn
a false oath’; and there is a similar passage elsewhere in the Iliad which refers to the
punishment of dead perjurers without naming the punishers.88
If some few of the dead in Homer’s account are assigned a better or worse fate
than is reserved for most of their fellows, these are not ordinary mortals but great
ﬁgures from the mythical past who are either specially favoured by the gods or,
conversely, have incurred their everlasting hatred. A highly favoured few are spirited
away body and soul together to Elysion, a far-off paradise at the end of the earth,
while a few who have greatly offended the gods are subjected to perpetual torment
in the world below. We will consider the exceptional fates of these heroes and hero-
ines from legend, as presented by Homer and subsequent authors too, before passing
on to consider post-Homeric eschatologies in which every dead mortal is assigned
a better or worse fate on the basis of a posthumous judgement.
Elysion (or Elysium in Latin form) is ﬁrst mentioned in a passage in the Odyssey
in which Proteus, the old man of the sea, prophesies to Menelaos that he is destined
not to die but to be conveyed by the immortals to the Elysian plain at the ends of
the earth,
where fair-haired Rhadamanthys dwells and life is easiest for men; for no snow
falls there, nor do strong storms blow, nor is there ever any rain, but the Ocean
constantly sends up gusts of the shrill-blowing West Wind to bring coolness
to its people.89
The presence of Rhadamanthys, who has a name of prehellenic origin and was asso-
ciated with Crete (see p. 351), has encouraged some to argue that Elysion was a
survival from Minoan belief, but this is by no means certain. Whatever its origin, 
it is a land in which all is perfect happiness, materially but not grossly conceived,
and no one ever dies. Since this corresponds to the state of affairs in the golden 
age when Kronos reigned (see p. 69), Kronos is sometimes said to rule Elysion

in post-Homeric accounts, perhaps with Rhadamanthys as his subordinate.90 In
Homer’s narrative and the early tradition in general, this abode of bliss lies some
where far away on the earth’s surface rather than in the world below, as is indeed
the logical way to conceive of it, since Hades is a place for disembodied shades
rather than for living persons who have been made immortal. Entrance to Elysion
– or to the Isles of the Blessed (makaro¯n ne¯soi) as this paradise is often called – is
gained purely through divine favour, especially by heroes and heroines who are
related to the gods; in the above-mentioned passage in the Odyssey, Menelaos is told
that he will be granted this privilege because he is the husband of Helen and thus
a son-in-law of Zeus. Those who are named as inhabitants of Elysion or the Isles of
the Blessed in subsequent sources are mostly familiar heroes and heroines from early
epic, such as Achilles (sometimes with Medeia as his consort), Diomedes, Peleus,
Alkmene and Kadmos.91
Lyrical descriptions of life in the Isles of the Blessed can be found in two poems
by Pindar, his second Olympian Ode and a fragment from one of his dirges, from
which the following passages are worth citing:
There the breezes of Ocean blow gently around the Isles of the Blessed, and
ﬂowers of gold blaze forth, some from the shore on radiant trees while others
are nourished by the waters; and with garlands of these, they [the inhabitants]
entwine their hands and crown their brows . . . in meadows red with roses,
the land outside their city is shaded with incense-trees and is heavy-laden with
golden fruits; some take their pleasure in horses and wrestling, and some in
draughts, and some in lyres, while the ﬂower of perfect bliss blooms amongst
them; and a sweet fragrance wafts forever over that lovely land as they mingle
every kind of incense into the far-shining ﬁre on the altars of the gods.92
Those who were fortunate enough to be transferred to this realm would enjoy, in
other words, for all time and in ideal surroundings, the kind of life that the 
Greeks of the leisured class would enjoy when they could, active and joyous, 
even strenuous, but with no compulsion to labour, ‘for they trouble not the earth
with the strength of their hands, nor the waters of the sea either, to gain a bare
livelihood’ (as Pindar states elsewhere when describing a sort of half-way house to
this paradise).93
Another home for the privileged dead was Leuke (the White Island), which served as a retire-
ment home for great heroes of the Trojan War. Originally a purely mythical place like the
Isles of the Blessed, it was later identiﬁed with a small island in the Black Sea near the
mouth of the Istros (Danube). In the Aithiopis, a lost epic in the Trojan cycle, Achilles was
said to have been transferred there after his death by his mother, the goddess Thetis (see 
p. 469); and in the subsequent tradition, Patroklos, Antilochos and the greater and lesser
Aias are mentioned among its inhabitants, as is Helen (or Medeia) as the consort of Achilles.94
For the story of how a Greek from lower Italy was supposed to have visited the island and
met some of its ghostly inhabitants in historical times, see p. 583.
In his myth of the ﬁve races, Hesiod states that the some or all of the members of his
ﬁfth race (i.e. that to which the great heroes of legend belonged) were transferred to the
Isles of the Blessed by Zeus (see p. 70).
— The brothers and sisters of Zeus —
116

Elysion was located in the upper world in the original tradition because continuance of
bodily life was thought to be essential to a vigorous and enjoyable existence; but when the
idea developed that ordinary people might win a better fate for themselves in the afterlife
by living well or receiving certain initiations, the imagery that was traditionally associated
with this earthly paradise was borrowed to describe the part of the Underworld in which
the virtuous dead could expect to live. In the late tradition, Elysion or Elysium could be
used as a name for that special region of the Underworld, as in Vergil’s Aeneid.95 It hardly
needs saying that the whole conception is transformed as a consequence.
Dead heroes and heroines who suffered cruel punishments 
in world below
If some who were especially dear to the gods were transferred to an earthly paradise
as an alternative to death, some who had especially offended the gods were subjected
to cruel and ingenious tortures in the Underworld after their death. Here again the
earliest ideas are not strictly ethical, since those who are singled out for these punish-
ments are not the worst evil-doers let alone the wicked in general, but simply certain
persons who have excited the particular hatred of the gods. Odysseus sees three
offenders suffering such treatment during his visit to the Underworld in the Odyssey.
He ﬁrst sees the gigantic Tityos lying stretched out on the ground, bound fast so
that he is unable to fend off two vultures which peck at his liver, one on either
side. His offence was that he had tried to rape Leto, the mother of Apollo and
Artemis (see p. 147).96 Next comes Tantalos, a wealthy Lydian king (see p. 502),
who is subjected to everlasting hunger and thirst in cruelly frustrating circum-
stances. For he stands in a pool of water that splashes against his chin but vanishes
away leaving nothing behind whenever he tries to drink from it; and heavily-laden
fruit-trees of every kind spread their boughs above his head, but they are always
tossed out of his reach by a gust of wind whenever he tries to pluck their fruit.97
Odysseus offers no account of his crime; and since later authors disagree on the
matter, and even about the nature of his punishment, we will return to the matter
after considering the last of the Homeric sinners. This is Sisyphos, a former king
of Corinth, who is condemned to roll a huge stone up a hill without any prospect
of rest or release; for whenever he is about to reach the top of the hill, he is pushed
back by the weight of the stone, and it rolls right down to the bottom. Once again
the Odyssey neglects to explain his crime. According to Pherecydes, this task was
imposed on him by Hades because he had escaped back to the upper world by means
of a deception when he had died on the ﬁrst occasion (see p. 431); in that case, his
punishment also serves a practical function, since he can hardly attempt another
escape if he is forever rolling his stone. Or in another account, this task was imposed
on him by Zeus because he had told the river-god Asopos that Zeus had abducted
his daughter Aigina (see p. 530).98
In the Returns, a lost epic in the Trojan cycle, Tantalos was said to have suffered
a slightly different punishment from that described in the Odyssey, for a stone was
suspended above his head by Zeus so that it threatened to crash down on him if he
reached out toward the good things that were set in front of him.99 In later accounts
and in the visual arts too, this version is quite often combined with that found in

Homer.100 It was explained in the Returns that Tantalos had been invited to live
with the gods, and had been permitted to ask for whatever he most desired; 
but when he had presumptuously asked to enjoy the same life as the gods, Zeus
had been so annoyed that he had fulﬁlled his promise in a purely formal manner,
by granting him good things of every kind but in such circumstances that he would
never be able to enjoy them. Or in a darker tale, which must have been quite ancient
since it was known to Pindar, he tried to test the omniscience of the gods by serving
the ﬂesh of his child Pelops to them at a feast. They recognized the nature of the
meal, however, and brought Pelops back to life again (see further on p. 503), 
and the author of the crime was made to suffer for it in the world below.101 Pindar
refers to the tale only to reject it, for he is unwilling to believe that the gods could
ever have become involved in such unsavoury proceedings. He proposes instead 
that Tantalos suffers his punishment because he stole some nectar and ambrosia 
(the divine food of the gods, see p. 81) to share it with his fellow mortals.102 Or
in another account, which is ﬁrst mentioned by Euripides, he betrayed the fellow-
ship of the gods by revealing their secrets to mortals.103 Or ﬁnally, in versions which
are all too obviously of late origin, he incurred his punishment by abducting
Ganymedes (an action normally ascribed to Zeus see p. 522), or by denying that
the sun was a god, claiming instead that it was a mass of incandescent matter (a
heresy ﬁrst ascribed to Anaxagoras, a philosopher of the ﬁfth century BC).104
It must now be asked whether the punishment that was assigned to each of these
offenders was intended to reﬂect the particular nature of his offence. This certainly
seems to have been the case with Tityos, since the liver was often regarded as the
seat of the desires in ancient times; and if this notion was already current in Homer’s
age, it could have been appreciated that Tityos was made to suffer in the part of 
him with which he had lusted after Leto. Tantalos for his part had been admitted
to the table of the gods and had abused the privilege, and it is therefore wholly
ﬁtting that he should not merely be made to suffer hunger and thirst, but to suffer
it in such a way that he is kept permanently and painfully aware of his reversal of
fortune. This is clearly the moral that was supposed to be drawn from his punish-
ment in the Returns, and it is reasonable to assume that Homer’s audience would
have interpreted it in a similar way. The signiﬁcance of Sisyphos’ punishment is
less immediately obvious. Of the various explanations that have been suggested, the
most plausible relates it to the special nature of his crime as in the preceding cases:
since he suffered this penalty (in one version at least) because he had cheated death
by escaping back to the upper world, a symbolic meaning might be detected in the
process by which he is perpetually checked and forced back again as he tries to
make his way upwards.
Comparable punishments were assigned to other villains in the post-Homeric
tradition, but none became as celebrated for their sufferings as the Homeric trio,
apart perhaps from Ixion. Although the legend of his crime may have been quite
ancient, no deﬁnite evidence has survived of it until the ﬁfth century BC, when we
learn that he tried to seduce Hera and was therefore tied to a wheel and whirled
through the air on it (see further on p. 554). Although he would have been whirled
through the upper air in the original story, his punishment was transferred to the
Underworld at some stage in the Hellenistic period, and it must be admitted that
— The brothers and sisters of Zeus —
118

he belongs very appropriately in the company of Tantalos and Tityos.105 According
to an older tradition which is attested for an early epic, the Minyas, Amphion was
punished in Hades in some unspeciﬁed way for having mocked Leto and her chil-
dren106 (an offence ascribed to his wife Niobe alone in most accounts, see p. 157).
Salmoneus ﬁrst appears in this company in the Aeneid.107 As a mythical ruler who
tried to usurp the functions and privileges of Zeus (see p. 422), he belongs there
as ﬁttingly as Ixion. Other heroes who are named among the tormented dead in
Roman sources, though not in any surviving Greek source, are Phlegyas, who dared
to attack Apollo’s temple at Delphi,108 and the Aloadai, who launched an assault
against heaven (see p. 91).109
In the later tradition, the Danaids, a group of former princesses from the Argolid, are often
added to the number of those who are made to perform futile tasks in the Underworld. As a
penalty for having murdered their husbands (see p. 234), they must constantly attempt to
fetch water in leaky pitchers, or to ﬁll a large water-jar as the water runs out again through 
a hole at the bottom of it. The pseudo-Platonic Axiochos (probably ﬁrst century BC) provides
the earliest deﬁnite evidence for this punishment, mentioning it along with the punishments
imposed on Tantalos, Tityos and Sisyphos.110 Futile water-carrying is recorded as a task for
the dead at a much earlier period than this, for vase-paintings from the end of the sixth century
BC onwards occasionally show little winged ﬁgures struggling to ﬁll a leaky urn; but it can be
safely assumed that these images have nothing to do with the Danaids, especially since male

ﬁgures are shown in addition to female. In describing Polygnotos’ painting of the Underworld
from the ﬁfth century BC, Pausanias mentions that it showed two women carrying water in
broken pots, and that they were identiﬁed by an inscription as women who had failed to have
themselves initiated into the mysteries.111 This was presumably the original meaning of the
motif; such an initiation would have assured these women or others like them of a better lot
in the afterlife, but it is now too late for them to receive it however great their wish. The
imagery is not hard to interpret if it is remembered that prospective initiates would have to
take a puriﬁcatory bath before their initiation. When transferred to the Danaids in the later
tradition, their futile task comes to symbolize their unavailing effort to procure water to purify
themselves from their blood-guilt.
Oknos is another person who performs a futile task in the Underworld, constantly plaiting
a rope as it is constantly devoured by a donkey which stands behind him (or beside him).
Since his name means ‘hesitation’ or ‘vacillation’, his posthumous activity should doubtless
be interpreted in the same way as that of the anonymous water-carriers, as illustrating the
predicament of those who have put off their initiation until it is too late. He was shown 
with his donkey in Polygnotos’ painting; in Pausanias’ time, some explained the image in
terms of a fable, saying that it referred to Oknos’ fate during his lifetime as an industrious
man with an extravagant wife who had spent all his earnings as quickly as he had brought
them in.112
The signiﬁcance of these mythical punishments changes as the tradition evolves. In
the Homeric account, the fate of the tormented (as of the people who are trans-
ferred to Elysion) is wholly exceptional, and cannot be interpreted as providing a
warning for ordinary people, who could expect to share a common fate in the after-
life. When the notion developed, however, that there might be an overarching order
of justice in which the ordinary dead could be expected to be judged in another
world for crimes committed in this, the suffering of dead sinners from myth natu-
rally acquired an exemplary signiﬁcance. In Vergil’s depiction of the infernal place
of punishment, Phlegyas is portrayed accordingly as shouting words of warning
through the gloom, calling on others to learn from his example to behave right-
eously and scorn no god.113 It is worth noting, furthermore, that there was not
originally any separate place of punishment that could be described as a hell; in the
Odyssey, Odysseus sees Tantalos, Tityos and Sisyphos suffering their pains among the
shades in the common home of the dead. In subsequent eschatological schemes,
however, which involve a judgement of the dead, it came to be imagined that the
deserving and undeserving dead would be consigned to different regions of the
Underworld, which would be bright and blissful in the one case and dismal and
dolorous in the other. From the time of Plato onwards, the place of punishment or
correction (or the worst part of it) is quite often called Tartaros. This usage entails
a shift of meaning, as when the abode of the virtuous dead is called Elysion, since
Tartaros was originally a wholly separate place that served as a prison for banished
deities (see p. 23).
Developments in eschatological belief, and the idea of a 
universal judgement of the dead
The evolution of Underworld mythology over the centuries was inevitably much
affected by developments in eschatological belief, whether in Greek society in general
— The brothers and sisters of Zeus —
120

or in narrower circles within it. Although it would take us far out of our way to
attempt to trace these developments in any detail, something must be said about
the broader trends. With regard to the fate of the dead in the afterlife, two concep-
tions subsisted side by side in the classical period, the old one that suggested that
most of the dead would share a common fate, and a newer one that suggested 
that the dead would meet with differing fates in accordance with their merits. In
the ancient belief found in Homer, as outlined above, the dead would live together
in the same surroundings in the nether gloom as witless or semi-witless shades.
Even if a person fated to this half-life could have nothing horriﬁc to fear, the prospect
would be thoroughly dismal; Achilles declares in the Odyssey that he would rather
be the meanest serf alive than the king of all the dead.114 By the classical era,
however, another view had also developed in which it was supposed that the departed
might be rewarded or punished in accordance with their behaviour during their
earthly lives, or that people might assure themselves of a better lot in the afterlife
by receiving certain initiations. In that case, a pattern of light and shade is intro-
duced into the picture, for some must be consigned to a brighter destiny, presumably
in a brighter region of the Underworld, and others to a darker destiny. The mysteries,
especially those at Eleusis, certainly exercised a considerable inﬂuence in this connec-
tion; most Athenians and many Greeks from elsewhere were initiated at Eleusis,
and the rites seem to have been effective in enduing initiates with the subjective
assurance that they would fare well in the afterlife. In Eleusinian eschatological
belief, however, strictly ethical considerations remained very much in the back-
ground. In considering how it came to be imagined that the good might be rewarded
and the evil punished in the afterlife, some allowance should be made for the simple
evolution of moral sentiment; since evil is often rewarded in this world and the
good often suffer, it came to be surmised that the accounts must be balanced in 
the afterlife if there is indeed any order of justice. As we will see, such ideas were
certainly current in popular belief in the classical period; and they marked an advance
on the cruder idea that the crimes of individuals might be punished in their chil-
dren or descendants. Also of signiﬁcance were various eschatological beliefs of an
unorthodox nature that developed in relatively narrow circles, Pythagorean, Orphic
and Bacchic, from the late archaic period onwards. Although ritual factors were
important here also, members of such circles usually believed that it was necessary
to lead a good and pure life if one was to meet with good fortune in the afterlife.
Among Pythagoreans and others who accepted the idea of the transmigration of
the soul, elaborate eschatological schemes were devised in which the soul was
thought to undergo successive rebirths, living alternately in an earthly body and in
the other world, and to pass to equivalents of hell, purgatory and paradise after each
earthly incarnation. These ideas found their way into high literature and general
culture through the writings of such authors as Pindar and, above all, Plato. Thus
in the second Olympian Ode of Pindar, which has already been partially quoted above,
those who have lived a just and pious life in this world will enjoy a life of ease
below in a region where the sun shines forever, while wrongdoers will be subjected
to punishment; the soul then returns to the upper world, and whosoever keeps his
soul free from all wrong on either side of the grave for three successive cycles will
pass to the paradisal place described in the quotation above.115 This account reﬂects

a pattern of belief in which man is thought to have fallen from a divine origin to
enter into a cycle of reincarnation, from which he can ﬁnally escape by virtuous
conduct combined with certain ritual obligations, and so hope to achieve a condi-
tion of entire and eternal happiness. Plato again owes much to Orphico-Pythagorean
teachings for the imagery and pattern of his great eschatological myths; while later,
other religious and quasi-religious beliefs added their contribution. As the tradi-
tional Homeric ideas were interblended with subsequent ideas of diverse origin,
authors from the time of Plato onwards came to offer curiously mixed descriptions
of the afterlife, accompanied by increasingly elaborate and deﬁnite accounts of the
topography of Hades.
As has already been mentioned, Pindar and Aeschylus are the ﬁrst authors to make
any deﬁnite reference to a judgement of the dead (see p. 115), and it was generally
agreed by subsequent authors that the judgement was performed by dead mortals 
who had been exceptionally just during their earthly lives rather than by Hades him-
self. The three mythical heroes who are most often credited with this honour, 
namely Minos, Rhadamanthys and Aiakos, are ﬁrst identiﬁed as infernal judges in the
writings of Plato (died 347 BC).116 It can be inferred from the language that he uses
in this context that these were traditional names for the judges, probably derived from
the mythology associated with the Eleusinian Mysteries. In conventional mythology,
Minos and Rhadamanthys were two early members of the Cretan royal family who
were celebrated for their justice and their wisdom as lawmakers (see pp. 338 and 351),
while Aiakos was a king of Aegina who was a paragon of righteousness and often arbi-
trated in disputes (see p. 531). Plato adds the Eleusinian hero Triptolemos (see p. 131)
to the list in his Apology, along with ‘other demigods who have lived just lives’,117 but
Triptolemos rarely ﬁgures in this role thereafter. Some authors apportion separate
functions to the different judges as the fancy takes them; Plato suggests in the Gorgias,
for instance, that Rhadamanthys judges the Asiatic dead and Aiakos the Europeans,
while Minos has the last word if their judgement should need revision; or in Vergil’s
Aeneid, Minos presides over an infernal court which examines the cases of those who
have been condemned to death on false charges, while Rhadamanthys judges the faults
of the wicked in another region of the Underworld.118 Aiakos was sometimes said to
have been appointed to duties of another kind as the doorkeeper of Hades (or keeper
of the keys, which comes to much the same thing);119 and some authors continued to
follow Homer in believing that Rhadamanthys spent his posthumous life in Elysion
or the Isles of the Blessed (see p. 115).120
The dead are consigned by these judges to a better or worse region of the
Underworld in accordance with their deserts, and so to a better or worse fate in the
afterlife. Broadly speaking, the abode and manner of life of the favoured dead are
pictured in terms of the imagery that was traditionally associated with Elysion or
the Isles of the Blessed, while the unrighteous dead are condemned to the dismal
half-life that was the common lot of the dead in the Homeric account, and perhaps
to hard labour also and some form of correction or punishment. If due exception is
made for the cruel fates that were traditionally assigned to a few notable ﬁgures
from myth, Greek accounts of the punishment of the dead are very restrained by
comparison that those that were once current in the Christian tradition. There is
little direct reference to the inﬂiction of physical torment, up until the Roman
— The brothers and sisters of Zeus —
122

period at least. Such punishments as are recorded in connection with Eleusis are of
a symbolic nature; the impure will lie in mud,121 the uninitiated will strive in vain
to carry purifying water in leaky vessels (see above). The picture darkens, however,
as the Hellenistic period advances. In vase-paintings from lower Italy, the Erinyes
(Furies) or the Poinai (Avengers), who are much the same, can be seen inﬂicting
punishment on the dead with scourges or ﬂaming torches; and the pseudo-Platonic
Axiochos (probably ﬁrst century BC) remarks that the wicked will pay for their 
sins everlastingly in Tartaros where they are ‘licked by beasts, constantly burned by
the torches of the Poinai, and subjected to all manner of torment’.122 In literature
from the Roman period, mythical monsters are sometimes presented as agents of
retribution; in Lucian’s Dialogues of the Dead, for instance, the dead Minos sees 
a temple-robber being torn apart by the Chimaira.123
That is not to say that popular fears about cruel punishments in the Underworld are unat-
tested in the earlier literature. On the contrary, there is good reason to suppose that such
apprehensions were fairly widespread in classical times. In Plato’s Republic, for instance, the
aged merchant Kephalos remarks to Socrates that many old people like himself feel disquiet
in the face of death, for they begin to worry that the stories that are told of the world below,
and of punishments that are inﬂicted there for wrongs committed here, may in fact be true.124
One of the sayings of Democritus points in the same direction: ‘Some people, who know
nothing of the dissolution of mortal nature but are well acquainted with evil-doing in life,
afﬂict the period of their life with worries and fears by inventing false tales about the period
that will follow the end of their life’.125 Pausanias’ description of Polygnotos’ painting of the
Underworld gives an idea of how punishments for very grave offences would have been
imagined by such people; in one scene, a man who had been wicked to his father was shown
as being strangled by him when he arrived among the dead, and in another, a temple-robber
received punishment from a woman, perhaps an Erinys, who (so Pausanias tells us) knew all
about drugs and especially those that cause suffering to men.126 Popular fears about the beasts,
bogies and daimones of the Underworld also ﬁnd little reﬂection in high literature. We would
know nothing, for instance, about the repulsive Eurynomos if Pausanias had not referred to
him in connection with Polygnotos’ painting; this daimon of the Underworld, who devoured
the ﬂesh of the dead leaving only their bones behind, was blue-black in colour like a carrion-
ﬂy, had grinning teeth, and used a vulture’s hide as his seat.127 In Aristophanes’ Frogs, which
is a rich source for lore of the Underworld, Dionysos and his slave Xanthias fear that they will
meet horrible monsters after rowing across into Hades, and are alarmed to encounter
Empousa, a female bogey with a luminous face and a copper leg.128
Vergil’s account of Aeneas’ journey into the Underworld
Having begun with Homer’s account of the Underworld, we may conclude with an
epic account from the Roman period which reﬂects intervening developments,
namely that offered by Vergil in the sixth book of the Aeneid; for in describing how
Aeneas passes through the different regions of the Underworld in the company of
the Cumaean Sibyl, Vergil provides the clearest and most elaborate and consistent
account to be found in any classical writer after Plato. To gain entry into the
Underworld, Aeneas plucks a golden bough on the advice of the Sibyl from a special
tree in a grove near Cumae, and brings it with him as an offering for Proserpina

(Persephone); it is suggested in later sources that he took the bough from Diana’s
grove at Aricia, plucking it from the famous tree that was guarded by the ‘king’
of the grove.129 After making their way below through a cave near Lake Avernus,
Aeneas and the Sibyl encounter two alarming groups of beings at the threshold of
Hades, the ﬁrst consisting of personiﬁcations of all that is most terrible in life 
(such as Fear, Hunger, Death, War, and others who are described as members of
the family of Night in Hesiod’s Theogony), and the second consisting of traditional
monsters of hybrid form such as the Hydra and Chimaira and the Centaurs, Harpies
and Gorgons, or at least the shades of them. Temporary inhabitants of that region
are the shades of the unburied dead, who have to remain on the near side of the
infernal river for a hundred years until they can be ferried across to the world 
of the dead.130
After making their passage across the boundary-river (here the Styx) in Charon’s
boat, Aeneas and his companion are confronted by the three-headed Kerberos, but
the Sibyl soon puts him to sleep by tossing him a drugged honey-cake. They then
follow a path which runs through the various regions or zones that harbour those
of the dead who are neither in Elysion nor in Tartaros. All are people who have
died before their proper time for one reason or another. First, at the very entrance-
way, the souls of dead infants can be heard bewailing their fate; in the next zone
come those who have been condemned to death on false charges, but are now
receiving true justice at a court convened by Minos; next come those who have died
by their own hand (even though they would now be willing to endure any suffering
under the light of the day, if only it were possible for them to ﬁnd their way back
again across the encircling coils of Styx); the fourth zone is formed by the Fields of
Mourning (Campi Lugentes), the sorrowful home of those who have pined away for
love or perished through its consequences; and ﬁnally, in the innermost zone, come
warriors who have died a glorious death in battle. Aeneas and his companion now
arrive at a place where the road divides, leading to Tartaros on one side and Elysion
on the other.131
The two of them skirt the borders of Tartaros, which is separated from them by
rings of battlements and by Pyriphlegethon, the ﬂaming river of hell. The groans
of the damned can be heard through the gates of Tartaros, and Tisiphone, the
guardian of the gate, can be seen sitting in an iron tower beside the gates, clad in
a bloodied robe. The Sibyl explains that Tisiphone, with some help from her sister-
Furies, whips the most wicked of the dead through the gates with her scourge after
Rhadamanthys has passed sentence on them; and she then tells Aeneas of the suffer-
ings that are imposed there on various mythical heroes such as Tantalos, Ixion and
Phlegyas (see above), and also on the Titans (who are now to be found in the same
place since Tartaros has come to be regarded as a part of the Underworld). Vergil
summarizes that character of the inmates of Tartaros most succinctly in the words 
ausi omnes immane nefas ausoque potiti – ‘all had dared a monstrous and unspeakable
deed, and had accomplished that which they had dared’.132 He speciﬁes violation of
the closest ties of blood-relationship and social obligation, treason against 
one’s native land, gross abuse of power, and direct offences against the gods.133
With this account few in antiquity would have disagreed. At the end of their
journey, Aeneas and the Sibyl arrive at Elysion, the bright and happy home of the
— The brothers and sisters of Zeus —
124

righteous dead. Here Vergil places, among others, great and successful patriots,
renowned warriors, priests and poets of more than common inspiration.134 At this
point we can take our leave of Aeneas, before he is accorded his preview of the
future history of Rome (see p. 591).
HADES, PERSEPHONE AND DEMETER
To return to the god Hades himself, he had only a single myth of the ﬁrst import-
ance, the one that told how he ventured into the upper world to abduct Persephone
as his bride. He rarely left his kingdom otherwise, if at all. Probably as the result
of a misinterpretation of a passage in the Iliad, it came to be believed that he was
wounded by Herakles at Pylos while he was assisting the king of that city against
the hero135 (see further on p. 278); and according to a minor myth from a very late
source, he once abducted an Ocean-nymph called LEUKE from the upper world 
to make her his mistress, and was so distressed when she subsequently died that 
he caused the white poplar (leuke¯) to grow up in her memory in the Elysian Fields
(here regarded as part of the Underworld).136 If Hades was disinclined to venture
above, his fellow gods, who shunned all contact with death and the dead, were no
more willing to visit him in his own realm, with the exception of Hermes, who
ventured into the Underworld when his duties as a messenger demanded it (and
conducted the dead to the boundary-river at least, see above). Hades had little or
nothing to do with the affairs of living mortals; at the most, it is suggested in two
passages in the Iliad that he and Persephone might respond through the agency 
of the Erinyes (Furies) if mortals prayed to them to fulﬁl curses (see p. 38).137
The few heroes who dared to descend into his realm while still alive placed them-
selves under his dominion by that very action, and he sometimes proved gracious,
as in the case of Herakles and Orpheus (see pp. 268 and 552), and sometimes less
so, as in the case of Theseus and Peirithoos (see p. 361). Hades also makes some
appearance in heroic myth in stories in which he grants temporary leave of absence
to heroes such as Protesilaos (see p. 450) and Sisyphos (who abused the privilege,
see p. 431).
How Hades abducted Persephone as his bride, but was ﬁnally
obliged to share her with her mother
Hades chose to marry PERSEPHONE, the only daughter of his sister DEMETER,
who was the goddess of corn and agriculture generally, and the patroness of the
Eleusinian Mysteries. Since he stole Persephone from the upper world in secret from
her mother, who was greatly distressed by her disappearance and was determined
to recover her, the ancient legend that tells of the abduction and its consequences
is the main myth of Demeter as well as of Hades and the maiden herself. In the
end, a compromise was imposed in which Persephone spent part of the year below
with Hades and part in the upper world with her mother. Persephone was a goddess
of twofold character accordingly, being at once the awesome queen of the dead and
a goddess of the fertility of the earth in conjunction with Demeter. She was often

closely associated with her mother in cult, so much so that the pair could be referred
to simply as the Two Goddesses (to¯ Theo¯) or the two Demeters or two Thesmo-
phoriai. Persephone was also known as Kore (the Girl) in cult. Although the latter
part of Demeter’s name certainly means mother, the meaning of the ﬁrst syllable is
a matter for conjecture; the once-popular idea, already current in antiquity, that the
name means ‘Earth Mother’ has come to be regarded as ill-founded.
The story of the abduction of Persephone is recounted as follows in the Homeric
Hymn to Demeter, which provides the earliest and fullest account. While the maiden
was once gathering ﬂowers with her companions, Earth caused a wonderful ﬂower
to spring up in her path on behalf of Hades, a bloom of unparalleled size and beauty;
and when Persephone reached out to pluck it, the ground opened up and Hades
emerged in his golden chariot to seize her and carry her down to the Underworld.
Although the Hymn names a purely mythical place, the Nysian plain, as the site
of the abduction, the incident was usually placed in Sicily in the later tradition.
Persephone’s cries were heard by Hekate and Helios alone. Her mother soon grew
anxious and hurried off in search of her, but could ﬁnd no news of her, whether
from gods or mortals or birds of omen. So lighting two torches (from the ﬂames of
Etna according to a later tradition), Demeter wandered the world for nine days,
fasting all the while, until she met Hekate, who told her that she had heard her
daughter crying out; and the two goddesses went off to consult the sun-god Helios,

who can see everything from his vantage-point in the sky. When Helios disclosed
that Hades had abducted Persephone with the connivance of Zeus, Demeter was so
upset and angry that she abandoned the company of the gods and hid herself among
mortals in the guise of an old woman.138
After long wanderings, she arrived at Eleusis (to the north-west of Athens), and
sat down by a well called Parthenion (the Maiden Well). When the daughters of
Keleos, the king of the town, saw her there while fetching water and addressed her
courteously, saying that she could be sure of a welcome from the women of the
town, she led them to believe that she was an old woman who had been abducted
from Crete by pirates, and asked them to help her to ﬁnd some work. So they went

off to consult their mother, Metaneira, who told them to invite the old woman
home to act as nursemaid to her infant son Demophoon. After entering the palace,
Demeter sat in disconsolate silence until her spirits were lifted by the jokes of a
certain Iambe, who caused her to laugh for the ﬁrst time since the loss of her
daughter; and when Metaneira then offered her some wine, she asked for kykeo¯n
instead, a drink containing barley-meal and pennyroyal. Coarse humour and raillery
had their place in the Eleusinian Mysteries, as did the use of kykeo¯n as a ritual drink;
in accounts from the later tradition, a woman called Baubo awoke the laughter of
the goddess by raising her skirts to expose herself.139
To repay Metaneira for her kindness, the goddess set out to confer immortality
on her nursling, by rubbing him with ambrosia each day and by immersing him
in a ﬁre each night to burn away all that was mortal in his body. Her plan succeeded
satisfactorily until Metaneira saw her burying the infant in the ﬁre one night and
cried out in dismay. Enraged by this unexpected interference, the goddess threw 
the child to the ground and rebuked the queen, telling her that she was Demeter
and would have rendered her child immortal if it had not been for her meddling.
She now resumed her proper form and commanded that rites should be instituted
in her honour at Eleusis, and she foretold furthermore that in the future a mock-
ﬁght would be mounted each year by the young men of the city in honour of her
nursling. She promised that when her demands had been obeyed and a great temple
had been raised to her, she would instruct the Eleusinians in her secret rites, which
would be celebrated there in future days as the famous Eleusinian Mysteries.140
As long as Demeter was absent from Olympos and in mourning, the earth 
was infertile and famine-stricken, for without her inﬂuence nothing could grow 
or reach maturity. After the completion of her temple at Eleusis, she remained 
there grieving for a year, until the gods came to fear that the human race would
die of hunger and that they would be deprived of their sacriﬁces as a consequence.
So Zeus sent the divine messenger Iris to Demeter to instruct her to return to
Olympos, but she refused to obey; and when he then sent all the other gods to her
one after another to offer her handsome gifts and whatever she might desire, she
still refused to change her mind, declaring that she would never set foot on Olympos
nor allow the crops to spring forth until she had seen her daughter with her own
eyes. Faced with this ultimatum, Zeus was obliged to send Hermes to the lord of
the Underworld to ask him to release Persephone. Hades acceded to his brother’s
request, but secretly invited Persephone to eat a pomegranate seed (or seeds in 
some accounts) before she left, and so ensured that she would remain bound to his
realm forever. When Demeter learned of this from her daughter after they were
reunited, she realized that she would have to accept a compromise, and agreed to
Zeus’ proposal that Persephone should spend a third of the year in the world below
as the consort of Hades, and the other two-thirds with her mother and the Olympian
gods. Or in some late accounts, it was agreed that Persephone should spend half 
of the year below and half in the upper world.141 Now that a settlement had 
been reached, Demeter restored fertility to the ground, and fulﬁlled her promise to
the Eleusinians by instructing Keleos and other leading men of the city in her rites
and mysteries.142
— The brothers and sisters of Zeus —
128

In the original version of the story, the mere action of eating from the pomegranate in the
world below sufﬁced to bind Persephone to that world forever; but it is suggested in some
later accounts that this fate came to be imposed on her because an inhabitant of the
Underworld bore witness to the fact that she had eaten there. The fateful secret was disclosed
by a certain ASKALAPHOS, who was a son of Acheron by the Underworld nymph Gorgyra
or Orphne. Persephone was so enraged that she sprinkled him with water from an infernal
river, the Phlegethon, causing him to be transformed into an ill-omened bird of the dark,
the screech-owl.143 Or in another version, Demeter punished him by conﬁning him under
a heavy rock, and transformed him into an owl later when Herakles rolled the rock aside
during his visit to the Underworld (see p. 268).144
Another minor transformation story is recorded in connection with the abduction. When
Persephone was brought below by Hades, MINTHE (or Menthe), a nymph of the Underworld
who had previously been his mistress, boasted that she was more beautiful than the goddess
and would soon win her lover back. Demeter was so angered by her presumption that she
trampled her into the ground, and a mint-plant (minthe¯) sprang up in place of her; or else
she was transformed into the herb by Persephone herself.145
In contradiction to the Homeric Hymn to Demeter, which assumes that the use of grain was
already known at the time of Persephone’s abduction, but intelligibly enough in a legend
of this sort which has clearly grown out of the cult of the corn-goddess, it was often claimed
in later times that Demeter ﬁrst bestowed the gift of grain after she was reunited with her
daughter; the Athenians liked to boast that they had been the ﬁrst recipients of the gift 
(i.e. at Eleusis), and had been generous enough to pass it on to others.146
All manner of local legends came to be attached to this great myth of Demeter and
Persephone. Two stories in particular are worth mentioning in connection with Demeter’s
visit to Attica. While she was once thirsty from the heat, a woman called Misme invited
her into her cottage and offered her some kykeo¯n (the drink mentioned above which contained
herbs and barley). The goddess drank it down so eagerly that the woman’s impertinent son,
ASKALABOS, laughed at her greed; and in her anger, she threw the remains of her drink
into his face and transformed him into a spotted gecko (askalabos). The marks of the inci-
dent can still be seen on the body of the little house-lizard, for it is blotched with the little
spots that were left by the barley-meal from the kykeo¯n.147 This Hellenistic tale was clearly
inspired by the episode in the Homeric Hymn in which Demeter broke her fast by drinking
kykeo¯n that was brought to her by Metaneira.148 In another Attic legend, Demeter once
received hospitality from a man called PHYTALOS who lived on the sacred road between
Athens and Eleusis, and rewarded him by giving him the ﬁrst ﬁg-tree.149
At Pheneos in Arcadia, which was one of the many locations at which Hades was supposed
to have descended beneath the earth with Persephone, the local people pointed Demeter to
the place of her disappearance, a chasm on Mt Kyllene above their city, and she rewarded
them by granting them a special favour, that they should never lose more than a hundred
men in any war.150
The Argives liked to believe that Persephone had been carried below at a site in their
own land near Lerna.151 When Demeter arrived in Argos in the course of her search, she
was informed of the matter by Chrysanthis, the wife of a primordial ruler of the land,
Pelasgos (see p. 538). Local tradition claimed that the goddess revealed her rites and mysteries
on this occasion, and that her mysteries were introduced to Eleusis secondarily and at a later
period, when the Argive hierophant (initiatory priest) quarrelled with the current ruler 
and ﬂed to Attica.152 Demeter was reputed to have worked a special miracle for the Argives
as late as the third century BC; for when Pyrrhos, the warlike king of Epirus, attacked 
Argos after being frustrated in his ambitions in Italy and Sicily, the goddess struck him
down in the streets of the city with a well-aimed tile from the roof-tops. Such at least was

the local belief; sceptics would have it that the tile was thrown by an Argive woman who
saw her son in confrontation with the king.153
In Hellenistic and later times, Persephone’s abduction was usually located in Sicily, which
was noted for its rich cornlands. According to one account, Hades opened up a chasm in
the region of Syracuse to take her below, and caused the spring of Cyane (the Azure Spring)
to gush forth at the spot.154 In Ovid’s version of this story, the spring was already in exist-
ence, and its nymph, CYANE, tried to block the path of Hades as he was making off with
Persephone; but the god directed his chariot straight into her pool, hurling his sceptre into
the bottom of it to open up a breach in the earth. Cyane was so upset by the fate of
Persephone and her own humiliation that she wasted away with weeping, ﬁnally melting
into the waters that she had presided over.155 Others said that Kore had been abducted from
the meadows around Enna or Henna at the very centre of the island, and that Hades had
emerged from a grotto nearby that communicated with the Underworld. The people of Enna
claimed that Demeter and her daughter had been born there, and that Demeter had ﬁrst
discovered corn there.156 It seems likely enough that in this very fertile region a corn-goddess
of some kind would have been honoured in local cult before any Greek had settled there.
The above-mentioned arrangement that obliged Persephone to spend a third of the year
below the ground and two-thirds above evidently relates to the rotation of the seasons 
in connection with the growth of crops and vegetation. The Homeric Hymn indicates this
directly enough by stating that Persephone emerges from the realm of darkness each year
‘when the earth blossoms with fragrant spring ﬂowers of every kind’.157 Although the myth
has quite often been interpreted as an allegory for the sowing of the seed-corn and its subse-
quent rise in the spring, it has been noted that this hardly accords with conditions in Greece,
where the seed does not rest in the ground over the winter after the autumn sowing, 
but germinates after a brief delay and grows throughout the winter. It has been suggested
accordingly that Persephone’s stay in the Underworld corresponds to the period in the
summer when the grain is kept in underground stores; but even if this provides a neat solu-
tion to the problem, there is no evidence that the Greeks themselves ever interpreted the
myth in such a way.
Persephone appears quite frequently in myth as the awesome queen of the Under-
world. It is assumed from the time of Homer onwards that she wields considerable
authority in that realm, joining with her husband in making decisions with regard
to the dead or to living heroes who venture below, and even acting on her own
initiative on occasion. The Iliad suggests that she can be invoked in curses and act
upon them in conjunction with Hades (see p. 125); and in the Odyssey, Odysseus
prays to her along with Hades on approaching the Underworld, and she sends shades
of the female dead to him and subsequently disperses them. Odysseus worries,
furthermore, at the end of his visit that she may send some horrible bogey against
him.158 Most intriguingly, it is stated that it was she who had granted Teiresias
his special privilege of retaining his wits after death (see p. 329), apparently on her
own authority.159 She is occasionally presented in subsequent sources as making
independent decisions with regard to mortals in the Underworld, whether in
allowing the dead Sisyphos to return to the upper world, or in allowing Herakles
to depart with Kerberos or Orpheus with Eurydike.160 As we shall see (p. 360),
Theseus and Peirithoos entered the Underworld with the speciﬁc purpose of
abducting her. She is hardly mentioned at all in connection with events in the upper
world; the only tale worth citing is the one in which she competes with Aphrodite
for custody of the young Adonis (see p. 199).

How Triptolemos spread the gift of Demeter; the other myths 
of Demeter, and her associate Iakchos
According to Attic tradition, Demeter’s gift of grain was spread through the world
by a young Eleusinian called TRIPTOLEMOS, an interesting ﬁgure who probably
originated as a local deity, but is ﬁrst mentioned in the Homeric Hymn to Demeter as
one of the Eleusinian princes who received instruction from Demeter in her rites
and mysteries.161 Although many different accounts are offered of his birth, he is
perhaps most frequently described as a son of the king who was reigning at Eleusis
at the time of Demeter’s visit (whether that king is named as Keleos, Eleusis or
Eleusinos), and he is sometimes identiﬁed with the nursling who was tended 
by Demeter. Or else he was a son of Okeanos, or of Raros, whose meadow outside
Eleusis was the ﬁrst site to have been sown or harvested, or of Dysaules, another
local hero with agricultural connections.162 Vase-painters liked to show him as he
might be pictured when setting off on his mission, seated in a two-wheeled chariot
(which is apparently self-propelled and may be winged) with ears of corn in his
hands. Or in literary accounts, he travels through the air in a chariot drawn by
winged dragons as he sows the inhabited earth with grain and spreads knowledge
of its cultivation. He was sent off on his mission by Demeter herself, who provided
him with the necessary transport.163
Three speciﬁc tales are recorded of his adventures during his travels. When he
arrived in Scythia, a local ruler called LYNKOS tried to murder him in his sleep
so as to usurp the honour of spreading the gift of grain; but as the king was directing
his sword for the blow, Demeter foiled his plan by transforming him into a lynx.164

Figure 4.6
Triptolemos in his chariot, surrounded by the gods

In the same region, CHARNABON, king of the Getai, plotted the destruction of
Triptolemos, and arranged for one of his dragons to be killed to prevent him 
from escaping. On this occasion too, however, Demeter came to the rescue of her
favourite, by hitching a new dragon to his chariot and returning it to him. As a
lesson to others, she placed Charnabon in the sky with a dragon entwined around
him, as the constellation Ophiouchos (the Serpent-holder).165 And ﬁnally, at Patrai
in Achaea, the ruler’s son ANTHEAS yoked the dragon-chariot while Triptolemos
was asleep and tried to sow some grain from it; but he was unable to control it
(much as in the legend of Phaethon) and plunged to his death. Together with
Eumelos, the father of dead youth, Triptolemos founded the Achaean city of Antheia
in his memory.166
Of the other notable legends of Demeter, one has already been recounted in
connection with Poseidon (see p. 101), while two remain to be considered here, one
very old and very simple that tells of her love affair with a mortal, and another that
tells how she punished an act of impiety that was committed against her in Thessaly.
The former was already known to Homer, who states in the Odyssey that Demeter
yielded to her passion for IASION and lay with him in a thrice-ploughed ﬁeld.167
The story also appears in the present text of the Theogony, which adds that the ﬁeld
was located in Crete and that the offspring of the union was a child called
PLOUTOS, i.e. Wealth, representing above all the wealth yielded by the ground
in the harvest.168 Homer cites Iasion’s story along with others to show how the gods
resented love affairs between goddesses and mortals, and states accordingly that 
Zeus struck Iasion with a thunderbolt after learning of his liaison with Demeter. 
In some later accounts, he committed the grave offence of trying to rape the goddess
(or, in a partially rationalized version, of desecrating her cultic image) and was 
struck down for gross impiety instead. Ovid remarks, by contrast, that Demeter
came to lament his grey hairs, which would imply that he lived to a good old age.169
There was disagreement about the place of his birth. If the Theogony implies that
he was a Cretan (and he is described correspondingly as a grandson of Minos in
some late sources),170 some authorities from Hellanicus onwards say that he was 
a Samothracian, a son of Zeus by the Atlantid Elektra (see p. 521) and the brother
of Dardanos. In this connection, his death is sometimes said to have prompted
Dardanos’ departure to the Troad (see p. 521).171 It has long been recognized that
the story of the mating on the ploughﬁeld is a mythical reﬂection of a common
fertility rite in which couples would have intercourse on the ﬁelds to encourage the
growth of the crops.
In Hellanicus, and apparently the Hesiodic Catalogue too although the relevant part of the
text is poorly preserved, the son of Elektra who became involved with Demeter was called
Eetion rather than Iasion.172 Iasion’s name also appears as Iasios. According to a late tale
preserved in the astronomical literature, Demeter bore two sons, Ploutos and Philomelos, to
Iasion in Crete, and the two of them subsequently quarrelled because Ploutos, who was the
richer as his name would suggest, refused to share any of his wealth with his brother. Under
force of circumstances, Philomelos bought two oxen and invented the plough to scratch a
living from the land; and his divine mother was so impressed by his ingenuity that she
placed him in the heavens as the constellation Boötes (the Oxherd).173

132

The second of these myths tells how Demeter afﬂicted the Thessalian hero ERY-
SICHTHON with perpetual hunger for cutting down a sacred grove of hers.
Erysichthon, son of Triopas or Myrmidon, wanted wood to build a new hall or palace
and, in an evil hour, chose to acquire the necessary timber by felling trees in a grove
of Demeter. In the ﬁrst full account of the story by Callimachus, he set out to
perform the task with twenty of his servants, and when the goddess herself tried to
warn him off in the guise of her priestess Nikippe, he merely threatened her with
his axe. Angered beyond telling by his behaviour, she told him to continue with
the work, for he would soon have real need of a banqueting-hall; and from that
time onward, he was afﬂicted with a ravenous and insatiable hunger. The more he
ate, the hungrier he grew and the thinner he became. He ate continuously
throughout the day, consuming all his livestock, and his mules and horses and even
the cat, until nothing at all was left and he was reduced to begging at the cross-
roads.174 It is stated in later accounts that he acquired money for food by repeatedly
selling his daughter MESTRA into slavery; for her lover Poseidon had granted her
the power to transform herself at will, and she was therefore able to escape on each
occasion by turning into an animal of one kind or another.175
This myth was probably fairly ancient since a surviving passage from the Hesiodic Catalogue
mentions that Erysichthon was called Aithon on account of his burning (aitho¯n) hunger.
Hellanicus apparently said the same. The fact that Palaephatus thought it necessary to provide
a rationalistic explanation for Mestra’s powers would suggest that this aspect of her myth-
ology was familiar by the early Hellenistic period. Mestra was mentioned as the daughter
of Erysichthon in the Catalogue; Lycophron is the ﬁrst author to state that she used her
powers to provide food for her father.176
In Ovid’s account, Erysichthon cut down the largest and oldest oak in the grove of
Demeter, ignoring the warnings of the tree-nymph who lived in it; and after its destruc-
tion and the consequent death of the nymph, her sister Dryads approached Demeter in
mourning to beg her to inﬂict due punishment on Erysichthon. The poet was doubtless
inspired here by a passage in Callimachus’ account in which Erysichthon began by cutting
down an exceptionally large poplar-tree, causing it to utter a cry that alerted Demeter to
the sacrilege. It is stated in both accounts that the nymphs of the grove used to dance under
the tree in question. To return to Ovid’s narrative, Demeter punished Erysichthon in the
usual fashion, and he ﬁnally sold his daughter to raise money for food. She prayed for help
from Poseidon, who transformed her into a ﬁsherman to enable her to escape; and when her
father sold her on subsequent occasions, she escaped in animal form each time (apparently
as the result of separate interventions by Poseidon, for it is not stated that he gave her the
power to transform herself).177
According to an alternative tradition, the fateful sacrilege was committed by TRIOPAS,
the father of Erysichthon (or a brother of his) rather than by Erysichthon himself. In a version
from the astronomical literature, Triopas offended Demeter by destroying a temple of hers
(sic, possibly an error) to acquire material for the roof of his palace. She punished him initially
by afﬂicting him with insatiable hunger, and added to his sorrows at the end of his life by
sending a huge serpent against him. After his death, he was placed among the stars at her
will as the constellation Ophiouchos (the Serpent-holder), in which the serpent can be seen
tormenting him forever.178
This Thessalian Erysichthon should be distinguished from the Athenian of the same name
(see p. 366).

Of some importance for cult, though of almost none for mythology, is IAKCHOS,
a minor god who was associated with Demeter and Persephone at Eleusis. He seems
to have originated as the personiﬁcation of a refrain in much that same way as
Hymenaios (see p. 223), in this case of the ritual cry of Iakch’ o Iakche that was
chanted by the initiates as they passed in procession from Athens to Eleusis.
Although he was often equated with Dionysos, apparently for no better reason 
than that his name sounds like that of Bakchos, he was also described as a son of
Dionysos, or of Demeter or Persephone (or indeed as the husband of Demeter).179
He presided over the great procession of the initiates as they marched along the
Sacred Way to Eleusis; his image was drawn in front of them on a cart and was
accompanied by his priest, the Iakchagogos. The chorus of initiates in Aristophanes’
Frogs appeals to Iakchos to shine on them as their leader.180 He is connected with
one notable miracle recounted by Herodotus. Just before the battle of Salamis, 
certain Greek allies of the invading Persians saw a supernatural cloud of dust (for
there was no one left in Attica to make one) moving from Eleusis, and heard 
the Iakchos-hymn of the mysteries rising up from it; and as it moved towards the
Greek camp at Salamis, the eye-witnesses knew that disaster was imminent for 
the Persian ﬂeet.181
HERA
The wife of Zeus and goddess of marriage
HERA became the consort of her brother Zeus, and bore him three children of no
exceptional stature, Ares, Hebe and Eileithuia; the smith-god Hephaistos was some-
times regarded as a further child of the union, or else as a son who was produced
by Hera alone without prior intercourse with her husband (see p. 79). Although the
cult of Hera had little to do with that of Zeus, her legends are mainly concerned
with her marriage to him and all that followed from it, and she came to be viewed
above all as the goddess of marriage and married women. It was inevitable that a
goddess, as opposed to a god, should have been cast as the divine guardian of that
all-important institution, and none could have been more suitable for the role than
the wife of Zeus himself. The greatest centres of her cult were the ancient Heraion
between Argos and Mycenae and her splendid temple on the island of Samos. Her
connection with the Argolid was particularly close, as is acknowledged in Greek
literature from the earliest times; Homer and Hesiod refer to her as Argive Hera
(Hera Argeie) and Pindar praises Argos as the home of Hera.182 It seems that she
originated as the great goddess of Argos and that her association with Zeus is
secondary. Her cult spread far and wide, however, ﬂourishing in the Peloponnese
and the Aegean islands in particular, and latterly the Greek colonies of the Italian
west. Although her name may simply mean Lady or Mistress (as a feminine form
of the word hero¯s), other etymologies have also been proposed.
Hera was pictured as a mature and even matronly woman whose noble and severe
beauty was very different from that of Aphrodite. In art, she is shown as a tall and
stately ﬁgure, usually fully draped, crowned with a sort of diadem (polos, sometimes
— The brothers and sisters of Zeus —
134

with accompanying veil) or wearing a wreath, and carrying a sceptre. Homer refers
to her as ‘cow-eyed’ (boo¯pis), an epithet that doubtless reﬂects her special connection
with cattle in her native Argos; herds of cows were kept at the Argive Heraion,
many votive images of cows have been discovered there, and it is known that Argive
Hera particularly appreciated sacriﬁces of white cows. Her status as a marriage-
goddess is indicated in many of her cultic titles. As the goddess who presides over
the solemnization (telos) of marriage, she was widely honoured as Hera Teleia; and
she could also be invoked as Zygia or Syzygia (she who unites in marriage),
Gamostoles (she who prepares the wedding), and Gamelia (she who presides over
marriage). Since the bride approaches legitimate marriage as a virgin, Hera can also
be addressed and honoured as such, whether as Pais (the Girl) or Parthenos 
(the Maiden, as in her cult at Hermione, see below) or Nymphe (the Bride).
According to a local tradition in the Argolid, she bathed in the spring of Kanathos
near Nauplion every year to renew her virginity183 (an idea that was probably
suggested by a rite in which her cultic image was bathed in the spring). At
Stymphalos in Arcadia, she was worshipped at three separate temples as Girl, Wife
and Widow (Pais, Teleia, Che¯re¯). Local legend explained the origin of the sanctu-
aries by saying that Temenos, son of Pelasgos, an early hero of the city, had reared
the goddess and had erected three successive temples to her under these titles, the
ﬁrst when she was still a young virgin, the second at the time of her marriage to
Zeus, and the third when she came back to Stymphalos for a while because she had
quarrelled with her husband.184 The real explanation of these epithets is, of course,
that she was worshipped by all women, whatever their condition, and represented
them at every stage in the usual course of their life.
As a goddess of married women, she would bring help to women in childbirth;
she was honoured as Hera Eileithuia at Argos and Athens, and is presented in myth
as taking direct action to ease the birth of Eurystheus (see p. 248). It is thus under-
standable that Eileithuia, the goddess of child-birth, a very ancient deity who can
be traced back to the Mycenaean period, should have come to be classed as her
daughter. Such emphasis was laid on Hera’s function as a wife and patroness of
married women that she was hardly conceived at all as a mother. She was never
invoked or portrayed as such, and she had no very close or ancient connection with
the children who came to be ascribed to her. These are of diverse origin, and it will
be noted that they were not deities of the very highest dignity. Hera was not at all
kind to her malformed son Hephaistos; for her unmotherly treatment of him, and
his ingenious act of revenge, see pp. 165–6.
Local myths and cultic traditions relating to Hera’s marriage 
or ﬁrst union with Zeus
The most distinctive myths of Hera fall into two groups, those that tell how she
was supposed to have married Zeus or ﬁrst been seduced by him in various parts
of the Greek world, and those of a more negative nature that tell how she perse-
cuted mistresses and illegitimate children of Zeus. Since the tales in the latter
category relate to heroic mythology for the most part, those in the ﬁrst group will
be our main concern in the present chapter.

135

According to a Cretan legend, Zeus wedded Hera with due ceremony on the island
near the river Theren in the territory of Knossos. Diodorus reports that a temple
stood on the very spot in his own day, and that the local people would offer annual
sacriﬁces there ‘and imitate the wedding-ceremony, just as tradition presents it as
having been originally performed’.185 Whether these rites went beyond the outward
ceremonial of the marriage to end with a ritual re-enactment of the sacred union
(hieros gamos, hierogamy) is impossible to say; although such rites are well attested
for the ancient Near East, the Greek evidence is far less deﬁnite. The myth of
Demeter recounted above in which she had intercourse with Iasion on a ploughﬁeld
(usually in Crete, see p. 132) certainly seems to point to a rite in which intercourse
was performed to encourage the fertility of the crops. The whole of nature is brought
into play in the famous scene in the Iliad in which Zeus encloses Hera in a cloud
to make love with her on Mt Ida:
then the son of Kronos clasped his wife in his arms, and beneath them the
holy earth caused fresh-grown grass to spring forth, and dewy clover and
meadow-saffron, and hyacinth thick and soft, that raised them off the ground;
there the two of them lay down together, and were covered all around with a
beautiful golden cloud, from which there fell glistening drops of dew.186
One of the main rites at Hera’s festival of the Tonaia on Samos also seems to
have referred to her wedding to Zeus (even if that did not necessarily exhaust the
meaning of the ritual). Each year at that festival, her statue was brought out of her
temple and carried down to the sea-shore, where it was puriﬁed and concealed under
willow-twigs, with cakes set out in front of it; the celebrants would then withdraw,
and make a show of searching for the statue and discovering it. The statue can be
seen on Samian coins with the withies hanging down from it; the vegetation in
question (that of lygos, or agnus castus, ‘chaste lamb’ in Latin) was symbolic of chastity,
here presumably of Hera as a bride. The Roman antiquarian Varro states explicitly
that the statue was draped with bridal robes, and that the festival was celebrated
with rites imitative of marriage.187
A cultic legend explained the various procedures by saying that pirates had once tried to
steal the statue, but had found that their ship would not sail with it on board and had
therefore left it behind on the shore, where the Samians had found it and had tied it down
with willow-twigs to put an end to its wanderings; but as is commonly the case with such
stories, this reveals nothing about the proper meaning of the rites.188 Another legend claimed
that Hera’s sanctuary on Samos had been founded by the Argonauts, who had brought her
ancient cultic image from Argos.189
Most of the local legends and rites that are recorded in connection with the divine
union refer to the ﬁrst prenuptial intercourse between Zeus and Hera rather than
to their wedding. It was claimed, indeed, on Samos that the pair had ﬁrst slept
together on that island in utter secrecy for three hundred years.190 The Iliad already
mentions that they ﬁrst went to bed together without their parents knowing, but
says nothing about the circumstances or place of the encounter.191 It seems that
Naxos also claimed to be the place of this prenuptial union, since the behaviour of
— The brothers and sisters of Zeus —
136

Zeus and Hera was cited in explanation of a local marriage-custom in which the
bride would share her bed with a young boy on the night before her wedding.192
Since Euboea was sacred to Hera and local tradition asserted that she had been reared
there by a nymph called Makris,193 it is no surprise that similar claims should have
been put forward on that island too. No less than three places were pointed out as
the actual site where the union had been consummated, two caves on the island
itself and one on an islet nearby.194
Another local tradition located the ﬁrst union at the south-eastern tip of the
Argolid near the coastal town of Hermione. On seeing Hera there on her own before
the time of her marriage, Zeus set out to seduce her. He assumed the form of a
cuckoo and settled on the mountain that was known thenceforth as Cuckoo Mountain
(Kokkyx or Kokkygion); and after stirring up a violent thunderstorm, he ﬂew over
to Hera as she was sitting on the mountain of Pron (the Headland) opposite, and
alighted on her lap. Feeling pity for the wet and bedraggled bird, she sheltered it
under her robe, at which point Zeus returned to his original form and proceeded 
to make love to her. Although she resisted him at ﬁrst because they were children
of the same mother, she yielded to him as soon as he promised to make her his
wife. A temple of Hera Teleia (the Fulﬁlled, i.e. as wife) could be seen at the
supposed site of the incident, and there was a temple of Zeus on the summit of
Cuckoo Mountain nearby.195 The great efﬁgy of Hera at the Argive Heraion showed
her holding a sceptre surmounted by a cuckoo, evidently in reference to the preceding
legend, as Pausanias remarks;196 this huge gold and ivory statue by Polykleitos, a
distinguished Argive sculptor of the ﬁfth century BC, was thought to rival Pheidias’
statue of Athena in the Parthenon at Athens.
A Boeotian legend placed the prenuptial union on Mt Kithairon on the southern
borders of the province. After Hera had been brought up on the island of Euboea,
Zeus abducted her to Boeotia on the mainland opposite, and they took refuge on
Kithairon, which, in the words of Plutarch, ‘provided them with a shady cave,
forming a natural bridal-chamber’. When Makris, the Euboean nymph who had
reared Hera, came to look for her missing ward, she was warned off by Kithairon
(i.e. the tutelary deity of the mountain), who assured her that Zeus was taking his
pleasure there with Leto.197
Kithairon was the site of a remarkable ﬁre-festival, the Daidala, which was cele-
brated by the Plataians on the summit of the mountain. In the usual ceremony, as
mounted by the Plataians in every seventh year, a wooden idol (daidalon) would 
be dressed in bridal robes and dragged on an ox-cart from Plataia to the top of the
mountain, where it would be burned after appropriate rituals. Or in the Great
Daidala, which were celebrated every ﬁfty-nine years, fourteen daidala from different
Boeotian towns would be burned on a large wooden pyre heaped with brushwood,
together with a bull and cow that were sacriﬁced to Zeus and Hera. This huge pyre
on the mountain-top must have provided a most impressive spectacle; Pausanias
remarks that he knew of no other ﬂame that rose as high or could be seen from so
far.198 The cultic legend that was offered to account for the festival ran as follows.
When Hera had once quarrelled with Zeus, as she so often did, she had withdrawn
to her childhood home of Euboea and had refused every attempt at reconciliation.
So Zeus sought the advice of the wisest man on earth, Kithairon, the eponym of

the mountain (rather than the god of it as in the story above), who ruled at Plataia
below in the very earliest times. Kithairon advised him to make a wooden image
of a woman, to veil it in the manner of a bride, and then to have it drawn along
in an ox-cart after spreading the rumour that he was planning to marry Plataia, a
daughter of the river-god Asopos. When Hera rushed to the scene and tore 
away the veils, she was so relieved to ﬁnd a wooden efﬁgy rather than the expected
bride that she at last consented to be reconciled with Zeus.199 Or in another version
of the story, Zeus sought advice on his marital problem from Alalkomeneus, the
earth-born ﬁrst man of Alalkomenai in western Boeotia, who helped him to cut and
adorn the wooden efﬁgy, which was known as Daidale (the Cunningly Wrought);
Hera hurried down from Kithairon, where she had hidden herself, with all the
women of Plataia at her heels; but as soon as she discovered the trick, the whole
affair ended in laughter and good humour. Alalkomeneus was introduced into the
story in this account because the Plataians collected the wood for the daidala from
a grove of oak-trees near Alalkomenai. To pick out the appropriate tree, they would
use a process of divination that depended on the behaviour of the crows of the area;
for they would lay out some meat for the birds, wait until one of them ﬂew off
with a portion, and then observe which tree was chosen by it as a landing-place.200
Hera’s myths of revenge
Although Hera was highly revered as a cultic deity, it was perhaps inevitable in
view of Zeus’ countless inﬁdelities that she should have been condemned to an
undigniﬁed role in many of her myths, which frequently present her as a wronged
and vindictive wife who is constantly wrangling with her husband and persecuting
his mistresses and their children. The main features of this portrait are already laid
down in the Iliad, in which she sometimes comes close to being a comic ﬁgure, but
is nonetheless a goddess of strong character and will who is a worthy match for her
husband (even if she is bound to fail in the long run when she tries to oppose him).
She risks his anger by intervening on behalf of the Greeks in the Trojan War after
he has warned the gods not to interfere, achieving her aim at one point by seducing
him on Mt Ida so as to distract him while Poseidon is spurring the Greeks to
success.201 Although Homer has little occasion to mention tales in which she fell
out with her husband over his love affairs, he refers more than once to the hatred
that she bore against his son Herakles, reporting that she had once caused such
anger to Zeus by sending storm winds against the hero (see p. 276) that he had
strung her up with a heavy weight attached to her feet (a form of torture that was
inﬂicted on slaves in classical times).202 The various tales from later sources in which
she is said to have harried Zeus’ lovers and children (for she could hardly take action
against Zeus himself) are considered elsewhere in connection with her victims. These
are not actually as numerous as one might suppose; she is not reported to have taken
any action at all with regard to most of Zeus’ innumerable love affairs. There are
in fact only four notable bodies of myth of early origin in which she was said to
have taken action in such circumstances, namely those in which she persecuted Leto 
while she was pregnant with divine twins by Zeus (see p. 189), and Semele and her
son Dionysos and his nurses (see p. 172 etc.), and Io, an Argive mistress of Zeus
— The brothers and sisters of Zeus —
138

(see pp. 228ff), and Herakles during his earthly life. She also caused the death of
Kallisto in some versions of that heroine’s legend (see p. 541).
As the guardian of marriage and wife of the supreme god, Hera could not conceivably have
had any lovers herself; nor would any god or man normally have dared to lay hands on her.
There is only a single myth of any note that tells of an attempt on her virtue, the quite
early tale in which Ixion, a mortal protégé of her husband’s, was foolish enough to try to
seduce her. She merely informed her husband, who laid a trap for Ixion by fashioning a
cloud-image of her (see p. 554). Endymion was sometimes said to have been condemned to
his eternal sleep (or hurled down to Hades) for a similar offence (see p. 411). As a ruse of
war, Zeus himself inspired one of the Giants with lust for her during the conﬂict between
the Giants and the gods (see p. 89).
Like all the great goddesses, Hera could be ruthless towards mortals who offended her.
To avenge the impieties of Pelias, who committed a murder in her sanctuary and scorned
her rites thereafter, she set in course the train of events that led to his death (see p. 380);
after she was passed over in the judgement of Paris, she became an enemy of Paris (sending
storms against him while he was sailing off with Helen, see p. 445) and an ardent supporter
of the Greeks during the Trojan War; in what was probably the original version of the myth
of the Proitides, she sent them mad for mocking the poverty of one of her sanctuaries 
(see p. 428). For her blinding of Teiresias, see pp. 329–30. In lesser stories, she sent Orion’s
wife to Hades for claiming to rival her in beauty (see p. 562), and turned Antigone, a
daughter of Laomedon, king of Troy, into a stork for the same offence. Or in another version
of the latter story, she turned Antigone’s hair into snakes to punish her for boasting that it
was more beautiful than her own, but the gods pitied her plight and turned her into a stork,
a bird that preys on snakes.203
HESTIA, THE VIRGIN GODDESS OF 
THE HEARTH
HESTIA was the ﬁrst-born child of Kronos and Rhea and also the last-born, since
she was the ﬁrst to be swallowed at birth by her father and the last to be disgorged.204
As the goddess of the hearth (hestia) and hearth-ﬁre, she presided at the centre of
the household and also at the communal hearth of the city. In other words, she was
the Holy Hearth, as worshipped by many peoples because it is a natural centre of
family cult, because an intimate connection is commonly sensed between ﬁre and
life, and because the hearth of a king or chief is of great importance in a primitive
community, and a perpetual ﬁre is often kept burning there, both for practical
reasons to provide a light where needed, and also for ritual and magico-religious
purposes. Although Hestia was highly honoured in Greek cult, even enjoying a
certain precedence, she was never really conceived as a fully anthropomorphic being,
and she has very little in the way of myth. At sacriﬁces, she would normally receive
the ﬁrst offering or a preliminary libation; in prayers she would usually be invoked
before any other god; and at feasts, the ﬁrst and ﬁnal libations would normally be
dedicated to her.205 These practices inspired the proverbial phrase ‘beginning 
with Hestia’ (aph’Hestias archesthai), meaning to make a proper start or sound
beginning.206 When the ﬁre crackled, it could be said that ‘Hestia’s laughing’.207
The Romans identiﬁed her with their own hearth-goddess Vesta, whose name was

probably of the same derivation and whose functions were virtually identical. Vesta
was far more important, however, than her Greek counterpart in her public cult as
a guardian of the state.
As a goddess who was closely identiﬁed with the hearth-ﬁre and could be imag-
ined as being conﬁned to her place at the centre of the home, Hestia had little
opportunity to appear in mythical tales. Plato alludes to her predicament (which 
was also, in a sense, her privilege) in his great myth in the Phaedrus, by stating that
when the other gods pass in procession through the sky under the leadership of
Zeus, ‘Hestia remains in the house of the gods, all alone’. She is excluded from 
the ordinary activities of the gods and yet remains forever at the centre.208 Since
ﬁre is naturally felt to be a pure (and purifying) element, Hestia was considered to
be a virgin goddess, and her hearth was tended by the unmarried girls of the house-
hold. Thoughts of this nature are reﬂected in ancient taboos connected with the
hearth-ﬁre; Hesiod warns people not to expose their naked genitals to it after making
love.209 Myths of a very elementary kind were devised to explain how Hestia’s 
choice of virginity came to be irrevocably established. According to the Homeric
Hymn to Aphrodite, both Apollo and Poseidon had sought to marry her at one time,
but she had stubbornly refused and had vowed to remain a virgin instead, placing
her hand on the head of Zeus to swear a solemn oath to that effect; and Zeus 
had then granted her high honours in place of marriage, declaring that she should
reside at the centre of the house and receive the choicest portion at sacriﬁces.210
Or after the defeat of the Titans, she had begged Zeus to grant her everlasting
virginity and the ﬁrst portion of all sacriﬁces.211 Vase-paintings sometimes show her
outside the conﬁnes of the home, accompanying the other gods on festal occasions,
such as the marriage of Peleus and Thetis. Ovid recounts a tale with a purely Roman
aetiology in which her counterpart Vesta is saved from rape by the timely braying
of an ass (see p. 222).

THE YOUNGER OLYMPIAN
GODS AND GODDESSES

T
he great Olympian deities who remain to be considered were all of younger
birth than Zeus and the other children of Kronos, with the possible exception
of Aphrodite. Zeus fathered three divine sons soon after his rise to power,
Hephaistos and Ares by his wife Hera (unless she brought Hephaistos to birth
without his involvement, see p. 79), and Apollo by his cousin Leto as the twin
brother of Artemis; and he completed the Olympian family during the heroic era
by fathering Hermes and Dionysos through liaisons with mortal women. As a
radiant god of prophecy, music and healing, Apollo was the most exalted of these
younger Olympian gods, and we will start with him accordingly before passing on
to the children of Zeus’ marriage. The deities who came to be classed as children
of Zeus and Hera were of diverse origin and not of the very highest status; their
daughters Hebe and Eileithuia cannot even be included in the present company as
Olympian deities of the ﬁrst rank. Of their sons, Hephaistos was something of an
outsider among the Olympians, not only because he laboured as a manual worker
in his function as the divine blacksmith, but also because he was partially deformed;
and even if war, which was the special concern of his brother Ares, was not regarded
as being ignoble in itself, Ares was a vicious and bloodthirsty god who delighted
in mayhem and slaughter for their own sake, and was consequently not viewed with
much respect by either gods or mortals. The two late-born Olympians, Hermes and
Dionysos, were gods of idiosyncratic character, Hermes a divine trickster and
messenger who was much concerned with boundaries and their transgression, and
Dionysos a god of wine and ecstasy.
Zeus brought his dearest child, Athena, to birth from his own head after swal-
lowing her mother Metis; and he fathered Artemis by the goddess Leto as the twin
brother of Apollo. Both were virgin goddesses who enjoyed active pursuits, Athena
as a warrior-goddess and city-goddess who was a patroness of arts and manufactures,
and Artemis as a divine huntress who had no love for armies and cities 
but preferred to roam through the untamed countryside with her attendant nymphs.
If Aphrodite was born from the sea-foam that surrounded the severed genitals 
of Ouranos as in the standard account derived from Hesiod (see p. 194), she was
the ﬁrst-born of the Olympian gods; or if she was of more conventional birth 
as the daughter of Zeus and Dione, as is suggested by Homer, she belonged to the

same generation as Athena and Artemis. It makes no practical difference, however,
whether she was of more ancient or more recent origin, since she was imagined as
young and supremely beautiful, as the goddess of love and sexual allure.
APOLLO
Whatever his origin, APOLLO (Apollon) is the most characteristically Greek of all
the gods in his developed form; and on account of the picturesque beauty with
which Hellenic art and literature surrounded him, he is still widely familiar today,
perhaps more than any other Olympian deity, as an embodiment of the Hellenic
spirit. He embodies the Hellenic values of reason, harmony, lucidity and modera-
tion; he is the unerring prophet who knows the true and the right and the will of
his father Zeus, revealing them to mortals, though often in enigmatic fashion,
through his many oracles; he is a god of puriﬁcation and healing, but also the archer-
god ‘who strikes from afar’ and inﬂicts plague and death with his arrows; he is the
leader of the Muses (Mousagetes) and a patron of poetry and music, particularly that
of the lyre; and although agriculture is not one of his main concerns, he acts as a
protector of ﬂocks and herds, and preserves grain and crops from bad weather, blight
and vermin. His developed type in art is well known; his is the ideal male ﬁgure
which has reached its full growth, but still has all the suppleness and vigour of
youth. While all Greece worshipped him, and references to him are almost as
numerous as to Zeus himself, his most famous shrines in Greece proper were Delphi
on the mainland and the holy island of Delos; and he had many shrines in Asia
Minor too, the best known being Klaros, Branchidai and Patara. His cult was intro-
duced to Rome at an early period by way of Etruria and the Greek colonies of Magna
Graecia, the ﬁrst temple being erected to him in 432 BC; he was honoured there
under his Greek name, having no proper Italian equivalent or parallel.
There is no general agreement on the derivation of Apollo’s name. The most inter-
esting of the various etymologies that have been proposed is the one that links the
name, in its early Dorian form Apellon, to the word apella, a Dorian expression for
a sheepfold and thence for annual assemblies that were held by the Dorian peoples.
It has been suggested that Apollo may have been worshipped by the Dorians from
an early period as a god who watched over ﬂocks and herds, and that he may have
been the god who presided over the apellai, and perhaps especially over young men’s
initiations that would have taken place at them (for Apollo represents the ideal of
the ephebos, the adolescent arriving at manhood). No other Greek etymology seems
very convincing. The ﬁtting suggestion, for instance, that Apollo could mean ‘he
who drives away’ (i.e. plague, disease) rests on the doubtful assumption that there
was a word in Greek corresponding to pellere in Latin. It is also possible that his
name was of non-Greek origin.
From the time of Homer onwards, Apollo is often called Phoibos Apollo or
Phoibos; this title is frequently interpreted as meaning ‘Bright’ or ‘Radiant’, but its
etymology is by no means certain. As a god who was undoubtedly associated with
the idea of luminosity and radiance, Apollo was quite often identiﬁed with the sun-
god Helios from the ﬁfth century BC onwards (see p. 43). Another notable title of
— The younger Olympian gods and goddesses —
142

Apollo of very ancient origin is that of Lykios or Lykeios, which was interpreted in
three different ways in antiquity, as meaning either ‘Lycian’ or else ‘Wolf-god’ (lykos
being a wolf in Greek) or, less plausibly, as signifying that Apollo was a god of
light (cf. lux in Latin). If the second interpretation is correct, it would refer to the
god’s activities in warding away wolves from ﬂocks and herds; it has had its propo-
nents, especially among those who set great store on Apollo’s Dorian connections.
But the ﬁrst interpretation seems most attractive in view of Apollo’s early connec-
tions with Asia Minor, and with Lycia in the south-west speciﬁcally. The Homeric
evidence is of particular importance here. In the Iliad, which presents Apollo as
supporting the Trojans of Asia Minor against the Greeks, Athena urges Pandaros,
a Lycian ally of the Trojans, to vow a sacriﬁce to Apollo Lykegenes (surely meaning
‘the Lycian-born’) for his safe return home.1 All the shrines of Apollo mentioned
by Homer are set in Asia Minor, and many of his most notable oracles were located
at various points on its coast (including Patara in Lycia). Lycia was also linked in
various ways to Apollo’s cultic centre of Delos; the mysterious poet Olen, for
instance, who was supposed to have written certain ancient hymns that were sung
on Delos, was described as a Lycian.
Because of Apollo’s many connections with Asia Minor, it was once widely argued that he
and his cult were imported into Greece from that area. In further support of this view, it
was suggested (for instance) that his mother Leto could be identiﬁed with the Lycian goddess
Lada, and that it is signiﬁcant that the Greeks should often have referred to him as Letoides,
‘son of Leto’, since this accorded with the Lycian custom, as attested by Herodotus,2 of using
matronymics (rather than patronymics as was normal in Greece). The main rival theory, 
which was of long standing but was rather eclipsed by the Asian theory, proposed instead
that Apollo had been imported into Greece from the north. His Dorian connections might
be interpreted as favouring such a view, and its advocates also pointed to certain features of
his cult, notably the offerings that used to be sent to his shrine on Delos each year by a
circuitous route from the north, supposedly from the Hyperboreans (see p. 148), and the
great procession of the Stepteria that proceeded north from Delphi (see p. 145), perhaps
following in reverse direction the route by which the god had ﬁrst come to his Delphian
shrine. If such theories about the god’s origin have rather fallen into discredit in recent
times, it is only partly because speciﬁc arguments advanced in favour of one view or another
have been felt to be unsatisfactory, even if that has often been the case. It is doubtful, for
instance, whether the cultic features that were cited in favour of the northern theory can
bear the weight that was placed on them, or, on the other side, that Apollo’s epithet of
Letoides is really of any signiﬁcance, since other sons of Zeus are regularly referred to as
sons of their mother (e.g. Hermes as son of Maia). Even if it can be accepted, however, that
Apollo had ancient and deﬁnite connections with Asia Minor, as was certainly the case, or
with the Dorians and the north, it has come increasingly to be felt that it is pointless to
seek for a single ‘origin’ for a god who was as complex as the classical Apollo, as if he had
simply been imported from abroad with his name and cult and major aspects of his myth-
ology. It would seem, rather, that he was a many-faceted ﬁgure who absorbed features from
a variety of deities and from the cults and myths of different areas. If some features asso-
ciate him with the west coast of Asia Minor or with the Dorians and the north, there are
also features that associate him with other areas; in so far as he was a plague-god, for instance,
who inﬂicts pestilence and death with his arrows, he was apparently modelled on the Semitic
plague-god Reshep, who caused disease by shooting ﬁrebrands. Reshep was worshipped by

the Phoenicians in Cyprus, where he was equated with Apollo. Notable features of Apollonian
religion such as ecstatic prophecy and puriﬁcation also associate him with the Near East,
while his cultic hymn, the paean, seems to have originated in Crete.
How Apollo established his oracle at Delphi; the omphalos 
and tripod
Apollo was the son of Zeus and Leto, and the twin brother of Artemis.3 After being
turned away from many places owing to the jealousy of Hera, Leto brought her chil-
dren to birth on the holy island of Delos, as will be described below in connection
with Artemis (see p. 188). Like the wonder-child that he was, Apollo began his
adventures immediately, and his ﬁrst act, or nearly so, was to establish his oracular
shrine at Delphi. According to the Homeric Hymn to Apollo, which provides the 
earliest account of his precocious adventures, he was never suckled at all by his
mother, but received some nectar and ambrosia from Themis and burst free of 
his swaddling-clothes as soon as he tasted it. Declaring that the lyre would always
be dear to him, and that he would announce the unfailing will of Zeus to mortals,
he set off at once to seek a place for his oracle.4 After travelling through much 
of northern and central Greece, he stopped at an attractive site by the spring of
Telphousa (or Tilphousa) near Haliartos in western Boeotia; but Telphousa, the
nymph of the spring, was reluctant to share the site with a deity who would far
outshine her, and urged him to pass on to Mt Parnassos instead, saying that he
would otherwise be constantly irritated by the noise of horses and mules as they
watered at the springs.5 Although he discovered an ideal spot for his shrine at the
site of Delphi under Parnassos, he came to realize that Telphousa must have had
ulterior motives in recommending it when he found that it was guarded by a fear-
some dragon. Although this monster had previously killed all who had approached
it, Apollo shot it dead with one of his arrows, and then returned to settle his score
with Telphousa. He punished her by hiding her streams under a cliff (for they had
previously risen in open ground); and he subordinated her cult to his own by erecting
an altar to himself in a neighbouring grove, where he was honoured thenceforth as
Telphousian Apollo.6 The spring of Telphousa was otherwise noted in myth for its
association with the Theban seer Teiresias, who was supposed to have died while
drinking from its waters (see p. 331) and to have been buried nearby.
Apollo had now to consider how he could ﬁnd suitable priests for his oracular
shrine. As he was pondering the matter, he noticed that a ﬁne ship was sailing from
Crete to trade at Pylos on the west coast of the Peloponnese. So he intercepted it
on the open sea, leaping on to its deck in the form of a huge and awesome dolphin.
As the crew quivered with fear, he caused it to be blown swiftly along the west 
coast of the Peloponnese and into the Corinthian Gulf. After bringing it to shore
at Crisa, on the southern shore of the Greek mainland near Delphi, he manifested
himself in his true divine form and revealed his name. He ordered the Cretans to
establish a cult to him as Apollo Delphinios and then accompany him to Delphi,
where they and their descendants would serve as the keepers of his temple, receiving
a share from the sacriﬁces; and with their arrival in Delphi, the Homeric Hymn
draws to an end.7
— The younger Olympian gods and goddesses —
144

It is stated in the Hymn that the region of Delphi acquired its old name of Pytho,
and Apollo his corresponding title of Pythian Apollo, because the corpse of the
dragon ‘rotted’ there (as though the name Pytho were derived from pythein, to rot).8
The dragon is female in this account; see p. 84 for the story of its origin. 
In Hellenistic and later accounts, however, the Delphian dragon is usually a male
creature called PYTHON, and is itself the eponym of the region (although there are
also accounts in which the beast is named Delphyne or Delphynes or the like after
Delphi9). Some said that the young Apollo was carried to Delphi by his mother and
shot the dragon from her arms, either on his own or with the help of his sister.10
As will be considered in further detail below (see p. 189), a tale from Hyginus claims
that Python had tried to kill Leto during her pregnancy to prevent her from giving
birth to her divine twins; in that case, Apollo travelled to the site of Delphi four 
days after his birth to kill the dragon by way of revenge.11 The earth-goddess Gaia
was often regarded as the original owner of the oracle. Aeschylus points to a peaceful
transfer of power in which Gaia passed it on to her daughter Themis, and Themis to
Apollo’s grandmother Phoibe (a Titan, see p. 37), and Phoibe to Apollo.12
Since the oracle was presented in Delphian tradition as having formerly been the
property of Earth, and since snakes are chthonian creatures, we may connect 
the dragon-slaying, whatever the precise details of the story, with the taking over
of the shrine. Certain it is that Python was closely interwoven with the traditions
and ritual of the place in historical times. At the great festival of the Stepteria
(Festival of Wreathes), for example, the central ﬁgure, a well-born Delphian youth,
would be led to a lightly constructed house known as ‘Python’s palace’, which would
be set on ﬁre. The youth, apparently impersonating Apollo, would then make a
show of going into exile, and actually set off on a long journey with attendants and
much ceremony, passing by the sacred Pythian way northward through Thessaly to
the Vale of Tempe, where he would be puriﬁed; and he would come back after-
wards crowned with laurel, Apollo’s special plant. Whatever the true meaning of
all this curious ritual, there is no doubt that the ancients connected it with the
slaying of Python, claiming in the usual account that Apollo had travelled to Tempe
to be puriﬁed from the killing before he could take over the oracle. Or else the
dragon had ﬂed northwards in a badly wounded state, with the young god in close
pursuit, until it ﬁnally expired.13 At the Pythian Games, which were second only
to those at Olympia, one of the leading events was a contest in ﬂute-playing in
which the subject was a descriptive piece representing the combat between the god
and the monster.14
The other great features of Delphi, setting aside many of lesser note, were the
omphalos and the tripod. The omphalos or navel-stone was supposed to mark 
the middle point of the earth’s surface. It was conical in form, shaped like an old-
fashioned beehive, and was covered with ﬁllets of wool. On a striking ancient copy
that can be seen by visitors at Delphi, the woollen meshes are sculpted on to the
surface of the stone. Zeus was said to have discovered the central position of Delphi
by sending out two eagles from opposite ends of the earth at the same moment,
and then looking out to see where they met.15 Golden images of the birds were set
up by the omphalos, where they remained until they were carried off by Philomelos,
a Phocian general who plundered Delphi in 356 BC. Some claimed, however, that

the birds of the legend were not eagles at all (which were birds of Zeus) but swans
or ravens (which were birds of Apollo).16 Numerous representations of the omphalos
are preserved in the visual arts, often showing the eagles too, and it is frequently
referred to as the seat of Apollo. Occasionally we ﬁnd Python coiled around it.
In practice, the tripod was the seat of prophecy; it was set up in a sunken area
at the end of the temple of Apollo. His priestess, the Pythia, would sit on it as she
delivered the oracles in a trance-like state. The idea seems to have been that the
holy inﬂuence of the god could come beneath and enter her when she was thus
lifted clear of the ground; Hellenistic authors suggest that her ecstasy was induced
by vapours that rose up from a cleft in the ground, but this semi-rationalizing notion
ﬁnds no support in the archaeological or geological evidence.17 The Pythia was a
virgin of Delphian birth who entered the service of the god for life, and always
dressed like a girl. Her responses were rendered into verse-form (hexameters) by the
priests before they were passed on to the enquirer.
The SIBYL (Sibylla), who was the supposed source of many oracles that circulated in writing,
was said to deliver her prophecies in a state of inspired frenzy just as in the case of the
Pythia,18 and was sometimes linked to Delphi. In the oldest form of her legend, there was
apparently a single prophetic woman called Sibylla who uttered her prophecies somewhere
in Asia Minor. The village of Marpessos on Mt Ida in the Troad, an obscure place that is

remembered for nothing else, claimed the Sibyl as its own, as did the more important town
of Erythrai on the Lydian coast, and there was much controversy on the subject in antiq-
uity. This Asian Sibyl won the favour of Apollo, to whose service she was much devoted,
and he inspired her to give marvellous and infallible, if rather riddling, prophecies; some
said that she wandered off to Delphi (among other places) at some stage and delivered
prophecies there.19 The meaning of her name, which may be of eastern origin, is wholly
obscure. These oracles, of which an ever-increasing number entered circulation, were very
popular. They were extant in many places, and consequently many towns claimed to be the
birthplace of their author. In the end, as Sibylla came to be regarded as a generic term, a
whole series of Sibyls sprang up, some with personal names of their own such as Herophile
or Phyto, and the tradition became bewilderingly complex. Although estimates of their
number vary, and there is much confusion because the same ﬁgures often reappear under
different names, we may refer to a convenient list compiled by the Roman antiquary Varro,
who distinguishes ten Sibyls:20 the Persian, the Libyan, the Delphian (who is sometimes
described as a sister or daughter of Apollo, or even as his wife), the Kimmerian (who, being
located in Italy, seems to be the same as the Cumaean), the Erythraian (Herophile), the
Samian (Phemonoe), the Cumaean (Amalthaia, the author of the celebrated Sibylline oracles
of Rome), the Hellespontine (i.e. the Erythraian or Marpessian over again), the Phrygian
(again the Marpessian), and ﬁnally the Tiburtine (the result of an attempt to ﬁnd a Greek
equivalent of the local goddess Albunea; hence the name ‘Sibyl’s Temple’ quite unjustiﬁably
given to one of the most famous ruins in Tivoli). On the Cumaean Sibyl, see also pp. 123
and 154. Mention should also be made of the Jewish and Babylonian Sibyl, usually identi-
ﬁed with the Marpessian-Erythraian one, who is in some ways the most famous of all since
the Sibylline oracles in the surviving collection – obviously late forgeries for the most part,
containing Jewish and Christian propaganda disguised as ancient revelations – are in her
name. Behind these shadowy ﬁgures there lurk, in all probability, a certain number of real
women. The centuries intervening between the Dorian invasion and the time of full classical
civilization were a time of great religious upheavals. From those times a variety of names
survive not only of prophetesses like Sibylla but also of prophets such as Bakis, whose oracles
were very popular during the Peloponnesian War, and Epimenides of Crete.
There is no reason why we should suppose either the Sibyl or the Delphic prophetess to
have been frauds. The modern practice of spiritualism has made everyone familiar with the
fact that certain persons can, voluntarily or otherwise, pass into an abnormal condition in
which they speak, or even write, more or less intelligibly, without being conscious of it at
the time or remembering it afterwards. Apollo, like many African deities who speak through
prophets or ‘mediums’, no doubt found many of these abnormal persons to serve him in all
sincerity, even if the priests at Delphi may often have altered or developed the Pythia’s
responses to a greater or lesser extent when preparing the edited ofﬁcial record, which was
generally rendered in indifferent hexameters, couched for the most part in very riddling and
obscure language, so that if the apparent sense of the prophecy proved false, the god could
always take refuge behind another interpretation.
The killing of Tityos; Apollo’s association with the Hyperboreans
Another early adventure of Apollo was his confrontation with TITYOS, a giant who
tried to rape Leto soon after the birth of her children. Tityos is described as a son
of Gaia (Earth) in the Odyssey, or as a son of Elara (a Boeotian heroine who was a
daughter of Minyas or Orchomenos) in a Hesiodic fragment;21 or in Pherecydes’
account, which was devised to reconcile the preceding traditions, Tityos was fathered

by Zeus on Elara, but was also earthborn, in a manner of speaking at least, because
his mother brought him to birth from beneath the earth after Zeus had thrust her
there for fear of Hera’s jealousy.22 Homer makes a brief reference to the crime of
Tityos to explain why he was subjected to everlasting torment in Hades (see p. 117),
saying that he had assaulted Leto as she was passing through Panopeus on her way
to Pytho (Delphi). Panopeus lay to the east of Delphi in the same province of Phocis;
a large mound in the neighbourhood was identiﬁed as the burial-place of Tityos.23
Subsequent authors add that the two children of Leto (or one or the other alone)
rushed to the scene to save their mother from him and shot him dead.24 In less
orthodox accounts, Tityos was punished in Hades because he had tried to lay hands
on Artemis, or was struck dead by a thunderbolt from Zeus when he tried to attack
Leto at the order of Hera.25
Apollo was closely associated in both myth and cult with the HYPERBOREANS,
a mythical people who lived at the edges of the earth in the remote north. Their
name was interpreted, rightly or wrongly, as indicating that they dwelt ‘beyond the
North Wind’ (for Boreas was the name of that wind in Greek, see p. 48). As we
will see later in the chapter (p. 190), their connection with Apollo was established
even before his birth, for they sent envoys to Delos with offerings that they 
had vowed to ensure an easy childbirth for Leto. As often with the inhabitants of
mythical realms at the edges of the earth, they were pictured as a just and pious
people who lived a life free from all toil and conﬂict, diverting themselves with
songs, dances and feasts; and their company was therefore much loved by Apollo,
who was said to leave Delphi during the winter each year to spend some time in
their land. According to the early lyric poet Alcaeus, he ﬁrst visited their land soon
after his birth, travelling there in a swan-drawn chariot which had been given to
him by Zeus for his journey to Delphi; after directing the swans to ﬂy north instead,
he remained with the Hyperboreans for a full year, laying down laws for them, until
he ﬁnally set off for Delphi in the middle of the following summer.26 According to
a further story, he later took refuge with the Hyperboreans for a while to escape
the anger of Zeus after killing the Kyklopes (see below), and amber, a precious
substance which came from the north, was formed from the tears that were shed by
him during his exile.27 For a conﬂicting account of the origin of amber, see p. 45.
Although the land of the Hyperboreans was hardly accessible to ordinary human
travellers, Pindar reports that Perseus found his way there in days of old and saw
the Hyperboreans sacriﬁcing hecatombs of asses to Apollo, who takes a special
delight in their feasts and praises.28
In historical times, sacred offerings that were supposed to have come from the Hyper-
boreans used to arrive at Apollo’s shrine at Delos. Wrapped in wheat-straw and of unspec-
iﬁed nature, they were sent by relay from some unknown location in the north. Herodotus
provides a summary of their route, so far as it was known, saying that they were sent to
Scythia initially and then passed on by a circuitous route until they ﬁrst entered Greek hands
at Dodona (in Epirus in the north-west); from there they were relayed in a south-easterly
direction to the Malian Gulf and across to Euboea, and then down to the southern tip of 
the island and thence by sea to Tenos and Delos. They cannot be traced beyond Scythia,
however, and their true origin remains a mystery. According to legend, the Hyperboreans
had adopted a more conventional procedure on the ﬁrst occasion, sending two envoys to
— The younger Olympian gods and goddesses —
148

Delos with the offerings; but when the envoys (Hyperoche and Laodike, see further on 
p. 190) failed to return, they had decided that it would be safer to transmit the offerings
by relay in the future.29
Apollo and Koronis, and their son the great healer Asklepios
A healer himself, Apollo was the father of the main god of healing and medicine,
ASKLEPIOS (whose name was corrupted into Aesculapius in Latin). Although
Asklepios was honoured both as a god and as a hero in cult, it seems likely that he
originated as a hero and was raised to full divine status at a secondary stage.
According to the standard tradition, Apollo fathered him by KORONIS, daughter
of Phlegyas, a Thessalian heroine of Lapith descent (see p. 560). He was said to have
fallen in love with her after catching sight of her as she was washing her feet in
Lake Boibias in north-eastern Thessaly.30 She became his mistress and conceived a
child to him, but agreed to marry a mortal, Ischys, son of Elatos, during the time
of her pregnancy. Or else she engaged in a secret love affair with Ischys, who was
a Lapith like herself. It is explained in one account that she consented to the marriage
because she was afraid that Apollo might not want to remain with her as a mere
mortal31 (much as in the legend of Marpessa). Although the Homeric Hymn to Apollo
already refers to the antagonism between Apollo and Ischys, Pindar provides the
ﬁrst surviving account of the events that followed from it. When Koronis slept with
Ischys in secret from her father, Apollo came to know of it through his own prophetic
powers, and sent Artemis to Koronis’ home-town to exact vengeance on his behalf.
Artemis duly killed her along with many of her unfortunate neighbours; but as the
ﬂame was playing around her corpse on the funeral-pyre, Apollo could not bear to
see his child destroyed together with its mother, and stepped forward to snatch it
from her womb. Or in some accounts, he asked Hermes to recover the child, or shot
Koronis himself.32 Apollo was often said to have been informed of her inﬁdelity by
his faithful messenger the crow.33 It could then be explained that crows have black
plumage because Apollo turned his messenger black (from its original white) in
anger at the unwelcome news. Although this familiar detail does not surface in the
surviving literature until the Hellenistic period, it has a popular ring and may have
been quite old since it can be traced back to the mid-ﬁfth century BC in the visual
arts.34
It is reported in late sources that Koronis’ mortal lover was shot by Apollo or struck with
a thunderbolt by Zeus.35 An alternative tradition from the Peloponnese suggested that the
mother of Asklepios was a Messenian princess, Arsinoe, daughter of Leukippos (see further
on p. 424).36 Or according to the local tradition at Epidauros on the east coast of the Argolid,
the greatest centre of Asklepios’ cult, Koronis brought him to birth in that region of the
Peloponnese in the following circumstances. When her father Phlegyas, who was a noto-
rious brigand (see p. 560), once visited the Peloponnese to spy out the land, he brought her
with him without realizing that she was pregnant, and she exposed the new-born Asklepios
on a mountain near Epidauros after giving birth to him during the journey.37
Apollo entrusted his new-born son to the wise Centaur Cheiron, who reared him in
his cave on Mt Pelion in Thessaly. Under Cheiron’s able tuition, Asklepios learned

much that was valuable including the art of medicine, which he developed to the
highest state of perfection.38 He makes no appearance in heroic saga (except in one
or two late reports that suggest that he sailed with the Argonauts or joined the
hunt for the Calydonian boar39). By a wife who is variously named though always
called Epione in connection with his cult, he fathered a family of dual nature in
accordance with his own mixed nature as an ancient hero and a healing-god. As
Homer already records, he was the father of two sturdy epic heroes, Podaleirios and
Machaon, who sailed to Troy as joint leaders of a contingent from north-western
Thessaly. Since they had inherited their father’s medical skills, they were able to
help their comrades as healers and surgeons as well as taking part in the ﬁghting;40
the healing of Philoktetes in particular (see p. 471) was ascribed to one or other of
them.41 In the second place, Asklepios came to be credited with some children 
of another kind in connection with his healing-cult, a series of pale and shadowy
ﬁgures without any myths who personify various concepts associated with the art
of healing. Among them we ﬁnd Hygeia (Health personiﬁed), who may often be
seen in works of art either on her own or standing by her seated father, and Iaso
(Healing), Panakeia (Cure-all, cf. panacea in Latin and English) and the little hooded
child-god Telesphoros (Accomplisher).42
Asklepios’ zeal as a healer carried him too far when he set out to revive the dead.
According to varying accounts, he revived Hippolytos at the request of Artemis

(see p. 359), or Lykourgos, son of Pronax, and Kapaneus, two Argives who died
during the ﬁrst Theban War, or Tyndareos, or Glaukos, son of Minos; or in some
late accounts, he even revived so many mortals that Hades was impelled to com-
plain. In any case, this interference with the established order of nature was 
too much for Zeus, who promptly dispatched Asklepios to the Underworld with a
thunderbolt.43
Apollo’s servitude to Admetos, and the story of Alkestis
Apollo was enraged by the death of his son, but he could hardly exact vengeance
on his mighty father even if he had dared to attempt it, and therefore consoled
himself by killing the Kyklopes who had made the thunderbolt. Since he had thus
become guilty of bloodshed within his own divine clan, Zeus ordered that he should
atone for his crime by serving a mortal master as a serf for a year.44 It is claimed
in one account that Zeus would even have hurled him down to Tartaros if his mother
Leto had not intervened to save him.45 In an alternative version which was presum-
ably developed because the Kyklopes might be expected to be immortal as brothers
of the Titans, Apollo is said to have killed the sons of the Kyklopes rather than 
the Kyklopes themselves.46
Since he was placed under an eminently just and considerate master, ADMETOS,
son of Pheres, the king of Pherai in Thessaly (see p. 425), his sentence proved to
be less humiliating than it might have been; and he repaid Admetos for his kind-
ness by performing various services for him. While tending his cattle, he greatly
increased their number by causing them to produce twins at every birth;47 and he
helped him to win his chosen bride, Alkestis, daughter of Pelias. Since her father
had announced that he would give her to the suitor who could yoke a lion and a
boar to a chariot, Apollo brought the chariot ready-yoked to Admetos, who then
drove it off to Iolkos to display it to Pelias.48 Although the king handed his daughter 
over in accordance with his promise, Admetos soon had occasion to call on the help
of Apollo once again, for he forgot to honour Artemis while offering the wedding-
sacriﬁces, so angering the goddess that she ﬁlled his wedding-chamber with coils
of snakes as a portent of early death. Not only did Apollo explain the cause of the
trouble and advise Admetos on how to propitiate the goddess, but he also visited
the Moirai (Fates) and persuaded them to agree that Admetos should be granted a
reprieve from death if another person would consent to die in his place. According
to Aeschylus, he won this concession from these inexorable deities by softening their
hearts with wine.49
When some years had passed and the time came for Admetos to die, he sought
for someone to take his place, but no one, not even his aged father or mother, would
agree to do so until his wife volunteered. So when the fatal day arrived, it was
Alkestis who was summoned to the shades. Although Admetos’ acceptance of his
wife’s self-sacriﬁce might strike us as ignoble and cowardly, few would have felt
any discomfort over the matter when the legend was developed, for a woman’s life
was not regarded as being of proportionate value to that of a man. Alkestis was
acclaimed accordingly as an exemplar of wifely devotion. All the same, it hardly
seemed fair that she should actually have to fulﬁl her offer, and the tradition ensured

that she was rescued in one way or another. In the earliest surviving account by
Euripides, she found a saviour in Herakles as we will see; but there was also another
version, ﬁrst mentioned by Plato but quite possibly of ancient origin, in which the
infernal gods (or Persephone speciﬁcally) sent her home again because they so
admired her self-sacriﬁce.50
In Euripides’ Alkestis, Herakles calls in on Admetos while travelling north to fetch
the mares of Diomedes of Thrace (see p. 262), arriving at his home by sheer
mischance just as he and his household are beginning their period of mourning.
Even in this extremity, however, the claims of hospitality cannot be ignored; 
so Admetos tactfully pretends that no member of his family is dead, but merely an
outsider who had been staying under his roof, and welcomes the hero as a guest,
ordering his servants to see to his comfort.51 But Herakles soon discovers the 
true state of affairs from a servant, and takes measures to put things right. According
to popular belief, Thanatos, Death personiﬁed (see pp. 29–30), could be imagined
as literally carrying off the dead, much as Charos is represented as doing in modern
Greek folklore; so Herakles goes to the tomb of Alkestis to await the coming of
this envoy from the lower world, and wrestles with him on his arrival to compel
him to give up his prey.52 Alkestis recovers her life as a consequence and is brought
safely home. This play is very interesting for the way in which Admetos is presented
as reacting when he comes to appreciate the full implications of his behaviour after
his wife’s departure. He comes to feel that his life is hardly worth living now that
he has bought his survival at her expense; but it is never quite suggested that it
was actually wrong for him to have accepted her self-sacriﬁce. Euripides was not
the ﬁrst author to introduce Thanatos into the story, for it is known that Thanatos
came to fetch Alkestis in a play by an earlier tragedian, Phrynichos.53 This story,
with its somewhat primitive morality, its Moirai who can be made drunk, and its
Death who is so solid and material that a valiant man can overcome him by sheer
force of muscle, is full of folkloric elements.
Apollo and Kyrene, and their son the rustic god Aristaios
Apollo fathered the rustic god ARISTAIOS by KYRENE, a daughter of the Lapith
king Hypseus, who was a son of the Thessalian river-god Peneios. Kyrene had no
taste for handiwork or the company of maidens of her own age, but preferred to
roam the uplands of Thessaly hunting wild beasts, as a sort of local Artemis. Pindar
tells how Apollo caught sight of her as she was wrestling with a powerful lion, 
all on her own, without any weapons. His admiration for her courage turned to
passionate love, and he consulted with the ever-wise Cheiron, who advised him 
to carry her across the sea to Libya, and to establish her as the queen of a ﬂour-
ishing city (for she was the eponym of Cyrene, the most important Greek colony
in North Africa). So he abducted her from the windswept vales of Mt Pelion in 
his golden chariot and seduced her in her new homeland, causing her to conceive
a splendid son, Aristaios. Hermes took the new-born infant to Greece and entrusted
him to the care of the Horai (Seasons) and Earth, who reared him on nectar 
and ambrosia, the food of the gods.54 Or else Apollo entrusted him to Cheiron to
be reared in his cave on Mt Pelion; and when he grew up, the Muses taught him 
— The younger Olympian gods and goddesses —
152

the arts of healing and prophecy, and appointed him to watch over their Thessalian
ﬂocks.55 Or he was reared by nymphs who taught him rural arts which he later
passed on to mortals.56
Aristaios was an unpretentious rustic god who was said to have invented many
of the crafts, labours and pastimes of the countryside, such as bee-keeping, olive-
growing, the preparation of wool, and hunting in general or some of its varieties.57
He married Autonoe, a daughter of Kadmos, king of Thebes, and fathered a single
son by her, the great hunter Aktaion, who met a premature death in tragic circum-
stances (see further on p. 298). According to Diodorus’ neat little biography of 
him, he left mainland Greece forever after this calamity, ﬁrst travelling to the island
of Keos at his father’s order, where he established rituals to relieve Greece from
excessive heat in summer (see p. 177), and later wandering further abroad to Sardinia
and Sicily, introducing his agricultural arts to these new areas.58
Vergil and other authors in the later tradition blame Aristaios for the death of
Eurydike, the wife of Orpheus (see p. 552), saying that he conceived a passion for
her and chased after her, and that she stepped on a poisonous snake and suffered 
a fatal bite as she was running away from him. Since Eurydike was a dryad nymph,
her fellow nymphs took revenge on Aristaios by causing all his bees to die. As Vergil
narrates in his fourth Georgic, he then sought the advice of his mother Kyrene, who
referred him in turn to Proteus, the old man of the sea. By seizing Proteus as he
lay asleep and maintaining his grip on him as he repeatedly changed shape, Aristaios
forced him to reveal who was responsible for the trouble, and then reported back
to his mother. Kyrene advised him to sacriﬁce four bulls and four heifers to appease
the nymphs, and to leave their carcasses in a grove and return to the site nine days
afterwards to offer poppies and a black ewe to Orpheus and a female calf to Eurydike.
When he returned to the grove after that delay, bees poured out of the decaying
carcasses of the cattle and gathered in a tree nearby, providing him with 
a new swarm for his hives.59 The belief that bees arise from rotting meat was
apparently widespread, and not conﬁned to the Greeks; the fact lying behind it is
the existence of a ﬂy, Eristalis tenax, which closely resembles a bee and lays its eggs
in carrion.
How Apollo met with frustration in his love for Marpessa,
Kassandra and Daphne, and accidentally killed Hyakinthos
Apollo was generally more or less unhappy in his loves. We have already seen one
example of this in the story of Koronis; and in another early tale in which a mortal
rival got the better of him, MARPESSA, daughter of Euenos, a beautiful Aetolian
princess (see p. 413), preferred to marry Idas, son of Lynkeus, an Aetolian prince
(see p. 422), instead of him. Homer alludes brieﬂy to the conﬂict between her two
suitors, saying that Idas dared to raise his bow against Apollo for her sake; although
no further details are offered, Idas evidently won his way because we are told that
Marpessa lived with him and bore him a daughter Kleopatra (who became the wife
of Meleagros).60 According to the standard later version, which can be traced back
to Simonides, Idas abducted Marpessa from her home in Aetolia, making use of
some swift chariot-horses that he had acquired from Poseidon. Although her father

Euenos set off in pursuit, his mortal horses soon grew exhausted, and he gave up
the chase at the river Lykormas in eastern Aetolia; he then slaughtered his horses
in despair and drowned himself in the river, which was known as the Euenos ever
afterwards. Idas continued on his way to Arene in his native Messenia, where he
was confronted by Apollo, who had also taken a fancy to Marpessa. When the god
tried to seize her, Idas raised his bow and threatened to attack him (or even began
to ﬁght with him); but Zeus intervened to separate the rivals, and allowed Marpessa
to make her own choice. Fearing that Apollo would abandon her when she grew
old, she chose in favour of her mortal suitor.61 Or in another version, which was
probably based on the famous myth of Oinomaos and Hippodameia (see p. 503),
Euenos forced Marpessa’s suitors to set off ahead of him in a chariot-race, on the
agreement that he would hand over his daughter if the suitor escaped, but would
kill him if he caught up with him. After he had killed many suitors as a conse-
quence, and had ﬁxed their heads to the walls of his house, Idas escaped with
Marpessa by use of his special chariot-horses, and the story then proceeds as above.62
Another of Apollo’s ill-fated passions was directed towards KASSANDRA (or
Alexandra), one of the daughters of Priam, king of Troy. According to a story which
ﬁrst appears in Aeschylus’ Agamemnon, the love-stricken god promised to grant her
the gift of prophecy in return for her favours; but after acquiring the gift, she broke
her promise and refused to yield to him. Now no god can recall his gifts; but Apollo
could take measures nonetheless to render her powers a curse rather than a blessing,
by ensuring that she would always be disbelieved even though her prophecies would
always be true.63 So when she tried to warn Paris of all the evils that would follow
from his abduction of Helen, or to warn the Trojans against bringing the Wooden
Horse into their city, her words fell on deaf ears. She remained a virgin until she
was captured at the fall of Troy; for her sufferings on that occasion and her subse-
quent fate, see pp. 477–8.
Although Pindar is the ﬁrst author in the surviving literature to mention explicitly that
Kassandra was a seer (and an ecstatic seer moreover whose ‘divinely inspired heart’ moved
her to predict the consequences of Paris’ behaviour), it is likely that this was an old feature
of her legend since she is reported to have delivered prophecies to Paris in the Cypria, an
early epic in the Trojan cycle.64 This need not imply, of course, that she was said to have
acquired her powers by deceiving Apollo in earliest tradition.
According to an alternative account, she gained her powers when she and her brother
Helenos were left overnight in the shrine of Thymbraian Apollo during their infancy, and
snakes crept up to them and licked their ears.65 Snakes were said to have conferred divina-
tory powers on the Peloponnesian seer Melampous by the same means (see p. 426). Unlike
Kassandra, who delivered her prophecies in a state of inspired abandon, Helenos was a ‘tech-
nical’ seer who worked by interpreting bird-ﬂights and other signs.
The relatively late story of Apollo and the Cumaean Sibyl, as recounted in Ovid’s Meta-
morphoses, seems to have been modelled partly on the legend of Kassandra and partly on that
of Tithonos (see p. 47). On meeting the Sibyl when she was a beautiful young girl, Apollo
fell in love with her and offered her the choice of whatever she desired in the hope of winning
her favours. So she pointed to a pile of dust-sweepings on the ﬂoor and asked to be granted
as many birthdays as there were grains of dust in the pile. Only when it was too late did
she realize that she had forgotten to ask for perpetual youth; and since she refused to allow
Apollo the liberties that he had been hoping for, he withheld this additional favour from
— The younger Olympian gods and goddesses —
154

her, and she grew ever older and ever more shrivelled. She was destined to shrink into a
tiny creature until she died at last after a thousand years (in accordance with the number
of the grains of dust).66 According to Petronius, she was ﬁnally hung up in a bottle at
Cumae; and when children asked her, ‘Sibyl, what do you want?’, she would answer, ‘I want
to die’.67
According to a famous if not very early tale, Apollo’s sacred plant, the daphne¯ or
laurel, was brought into existence through the transformation of a girl of that name
who had aroused the passion of Apollo. In the earliest surviving account of the
transformation, DAPHNE was a daughter of Amyklas (an early king of Sparta, see
p. 500) who used to roam through the Peloponnese as a huntress with a group of
female companions. As a true follower of Artemis, she wanted to have nothing 
to do with love, but Leukippos, a son of Oinomaos, king of Pisa, conceived a passion
for her and managed to win her friendship by disguising himself as a girl and joining
her hunting-party. As misfortune would have it, Apollo was also in love with her,
and he exposed Leukippos’ ruse by inspiring Artemis and her companions with 
a desire to bathe in the river Ladon. They duly discovered the deception when
Leukippos was obliged to undress, and they tore the unfortunate youth to pieces;
but when Apollo tried to seize Daphne for himself, she took to ﬂight and prayed
to Zeus to be removed from human company, and was transformed accordingly 
into the plant that bore her name.68 In all subsequent accounts, Apollo has no 
mortal rival. According to Ovid, who describes Daphne as a daughter of the river
Peneios in Thessaly, she prayed to her father to transform her as she was ﬂeeing the
unwelcome advances of Apollo.69 She was presumably brought into connection with
the Peneios because Apollo was said to have brought the laurel from the Vale of
Tempe, which was the outlet of the river. Or else she was a daughter of the river
Ladon in Arcadia, and prayed to Mother Earth to save her in the corresponding
circumstances; so Earth swallowed her up in a chasm, and sent up a laurel in place
of her as a consolation to Apollo.70
Apollo proved to be no more fortunate when he turned his affections towards
boys; the most celebrated of these was HYAKINTHOS of Amyklai near Sparta. He
makes his ﬁrst literary appearance in a poorly preserved fragment from the Hesiodic
Catalogue, as a son of Amyklas, an early king of Sparta who was the eponym of the
town of Amyklai (see p. 524); since a discus is mentioned at the end of the frag-
ment, it can be inferred that Apollo killed him accidentally with a discus as in the
standard later tradition. Euripides alludes to such a story in his Helen, saying that
the Spartans performed nocturnal rites in honour of Hyakinthos who was killed by
Apollo as they were competing in the discus. According to Ovid, Hyakinthos 
was struck on the rebound as he reached out to take the discus for his own throw.71
Or in a more elaborate version, Zephyros (the West Wind; or else Boreas, the 
North Wind) competed with Apollo for the love of Hyakinthos, and was so jealous
when the boy chose in favour of Apollo that he caused the god’s discus to swerve
aside as he was exercising with his favourite; but this is obviously a secondary 
version, suggested by an account in which Apollo’s discus was blown off course 
by a gust of wind (as Perseus’ discus was sometimes said to have been when he
killed his grandfather with it, see p. 243).72 To explain the origin of the hyacinth,

a transformation myth was devised in which a red ﬂower marked with the letters
AI AI (meaning alas, alas) sprang from Hyakinthos’ blood (or ashes) and bore his
name ever afterwards.73 Evidently a different plant from the modern hyacinth, this
seems to have been a form of iris. The name of Hyakinthos is marked by the -nth-
component as non-Indo-European. He originated as a pre-Hellenic deity who was
especially honoured at Amyklai and gave his name to the ancient Dorian festival of
the Hyakinthia. Whether his main myth was intended to account for his cultic
subordination to Apollo, or owed anything at all to his cult at Amyklai, is a matter
for dispute. Pausanias visited his tomb at Amyklai, and reports that the Amyklaian
throne represented him as a bearded man rather than a beautiful boy.74 For the story
of Kyparissos, another favourite of Apollo who met an early death, see p. 571.

The killing of the Niobids, and Apollo’s contest with Marsyas
If Apollo was a fervent lover, he was no less vigorous in exacting vengeance, although
it was by no means always on his own account that he exercised his terrible powers.
As has already been described, he killed the gigantic Tityos, perhaps with some help
from his sister, to save his mother from being raped (see p. 147); and he joined
together with his sister to massacre the NIOBIDS, the many children of NIOBE, 
to punish her for making a boast at Leto’s expense. Niobe, daughter of Tantalos, had
married a Theban ruler, Amphion (see p. 306), and had borne him a great many
children, seven sons and seven daughters (or six of either sex, or ten, the numbers
vary); and in an evil moment, she boasted that she was superior to Leto, who had 
only two children in all. So Apollo and Artemis drew their bows to avenge the insult,
the former slaying all the sons of Niobe and the latter all the daughters. In her sorrow
at the loss, Niobe withdrew to the land of her birth in Asia Minor, where she
continued to weep for her children until Zeus relieved her from her distress by
turning her to stone.75 The pillar of rock into which she was supposed to be trans-
formed could be seen by the curious in later times on Mt Sipylos in Lydia; according
to Pausanias, who came from that area, it resembled a weeping woman when viewed
from a distance.76 Apollo also killed Phlegyas for attempting to plunder his sanctuary
at Delphi (see p. 560), fought against Herakles when that hero tried to steal the
sacred tripod from the Delphic oracle (see p. 273), and sent a plague against Troy
when the king of that city, Laomedon, refused to pay the reward that he had promised
to him and Poseidon for building the walls of Troy (see p. 523).
Another story, from outside the realm of heroic mythology, tells how Apollo
imposed a gruesome punishment on the Phrygian Satyr MARSYAS for daring to
challenge him to a musical contest. On ﬁnding the double ﬂute (aulos) that had
been discarded by its inventor Athena (see p. 183), Marsyas had picked it up and
had taught himself to play it, eventually becoming so proﬁcient that he thought
that he could rival Apollo himself. The god agreed to compete with him on the
agreement that the victor should do what he wished with the loser, and the Muses
were invited to act as judges. When the contest began (or when his opponent seemed
to be gaining the upper hand), Apollo turned his lyre upside down, played on it
with consummate skill, and then challenged Marsyas to do the same; and when the
Satyr was unable to (for a wind instrument must be blown from the proper end),
Apollo was adjudged to be the victor. By way of a punishment, he suspended Marsyas
from a pine-tree and ﬂayed him alive. His shaggy hide could be seen in historical
times at Kelainai, a city in southern Phrygia near the source of the river Marsyas.77
The river was said to have sprung from the Satyr’s blood, or from the tears that
were shed for him by the local nymphs and Satyrs and shepherds.78
In another tale of this kind, also set in Asia Minor, Apollo engaged in a musical
contest with the rustic deity Pan. Tmolos, the god of the Lydian mountain of that
name, acted as judge, and the competitors played in turn, ﬁrst Pan on his rustic
reed-pipes and then Apollo on his lyre; and when Tmolos judged in favour of Apollo,
his decision was approved by all who were present with the sole exception of Midas,
king of Phrygia, who had been strangely moved by the wild music of Pan. Apollo
showed what he thought of Midas’ taste in music by transforming his ears into those

of an ass. The king was exceedingly ashamed, and wore his turban over his ears to
conceal the deformity. His barber was bound to observe the secret, however, and
since he was incurably garrulous (for this was the professional vice of barbers even
then) and yet could never dare to pass on the secret, he was soon ready to burst. 
So he ﬁnally relieved himself by digging a hole and whispering the secret into the
ground. As misfortune would have it, some reeds grew up at that very spot, and
whenever they were rustled by the wind, they betrayed the secret to all the world
by whispering ‘Midas has ass’s ears’.79 In another version of the story, Midas suffered
this punishment for judging against Apollo when the god competed against
Marsyas.80
HERMES
HERMES, the divine herald, was an ancient god who is mentioned on Linear B
tablets. His name was almost certainly derived from the Greek word herma, meaning
a cairn or heap of stones. Such cairns were a common sight by the Greek wayside,
where they served as landmarks and boundary-markers; and as in the popular lore
of other regions and ages, they became a focus for all kinds of superstitions. It would
seem, then, that Hermes originated as a relatively humble being, as ‘he of the stone-
heap’, the power that was supposed to reside in cairns. An aetiological myth was
devised to account for this association, doubtless at a fairly late period: when he was
brought to trial by the gods for having killed Argos Panoptes (see p. 229), they
caused a heap of stones to pile up around him as they all cast their voting-pebbles
to acquit him.81 From the late archaic period onwards, boundary-markers were often
erected in the form of a rectangular stone pillar with a bearded head on the top and
a phallus on the side, usually erect; such an object, which is called a herm in English
(from Latin herma), was known to the Greeks as a Hermes. Athens was particularly
noted for the many herms that could be seen in its streets and squares.
When imagined in fully anthropomorphic form, Hermes is pictured above all as
a herald and wayfarer. In this capacity, he is characteristically represented as wear-
ing the broad-brimmed felt hat (petasos) that Greek travellers would wear to keep
the sun out of their eyes, and carrying a herald’s staff (kerykeion, or caduceus in 
Latin). He is of course far swifter and less earthbound than any human traveller, 
as is indicated in many images through his winged sandals or hat. His most
important role by far in legend is to act as a messenger for the gods, and for Zeus
in particular. He is sometimes merely dispatched to communicate the will of Zeus,
as when he speeds above the waves like a bird to the remote island of Kalypso to
order her to release Odysseus (see p. 497); or he may take direct action to put the
will of Zeus or of the gods into effect, as when he guides Priam to the Greek camp
at night to seek the return of Hektor’s body, putting the guards to sleep as the two
of them approach Achilles’ hut.82 The whole episode is very characteristic of Hermes, 
who tends to be discreet or even furtive in his approach and actions but is almost
always benevolent to mortals. He performs numerous other missions, as we will see,
for Zeus and the other gods, and acts as a special protector to Perseus (see pp. 239ff)
and also to Herakles during that hero’s incursion into the Underworld. As would
— The younger Olympian gods and goddesses —
158

be expected of a herald, he rarely takes the lead in any course of action, and he
holds no very high place among the Olympians, but is rather the younger son of
the family, running errands for the rest. Mortal heralds could naturally call on his
protection, and he also presides over the arts that are required for effective communi-
cation, such as oratory and persuasive speech or interpretation in dealing with
foreigners. An interpreter was known as a hermeneus accordingly (hence the modern
term of hermeneutics).

In accordance with his original nature as the spirit of the stone-pile, most of the
functions of Hermes are related in one way or another to the wayside and wayfaring
and to boundaries and the transgression of boundaries. Under such titles as Hodios
(God of the Road) and Hegemenos or Agetor (Leader, Guide), he is the god of 
the road and the protector of all who travel on it, whether openly on legitimate
business or more covertly for nefarious purposes. If he is the patron god of merchants
and traders, he is also the patron of tricksters and thieves, a conferrer of fortune
whether honestly or dishonestly gained. Brigandage and cattle-raiding, especially
where undetected, were quite respectable sources of fortune in early days, 
and Hermes was supposed to have begun his career by rustling the cattle of Apollo.
He was a god of luck, moreover, in the widest sense, and windfalls and strokes of
good fortune of every kind lay within his gift. A lucky ﬁnd or treasure-trove was
known as a hermaion or hermaia dosis (i.e. gift of Hermes) accordingly. Like Apollo

Nomios, he was also a god whose inﬂuence extended over the traditional ancient
forms of wealth, namely ﬂocks and herds and their increase. In this connection in
particular, he had a special association with Arcadia. He was concerned likewise
with human fertility, and one of his oldest cultic emblems was the phallus, which
always remained a prominent feature of his cult.
As a god who was concerned with boundaries and their transgression, he was able
to cross over and so help others to cross over the most formidable boundary of all,
that which separates the world of the living from the world of the dead. He was
exceptional in this respect among the Olympian deities, who generally avoided all
contact with death and the dead; no other god passed over this frontier, apart from
Persephone of course (and perhaps one or two others in exceptional circumstances).
In classical and later times at least, it was supposed that one of his most important
ofﬁces was to serve as the psychopompos or ‘conductor of souls’ who guided the shades
of the newly dead to their future home in the sunless realm. As was noted above
in connection with the mythology of the Underworld, it seems likely that this was
not a very ancient conception, and that this duty was ﬁrst assigned to him well
after the time of Homer and Hesiod (even if he is once presented as performing it
in the present text of the Odyssey, see pp. 112–13). Associated though he may have
come to be with death and the journey below, he was never pictured as a grim or
formidable god, as in the case of Hades and Thanatos, but always as courteous and
kindly, as beﬁtted a herald.
In his earlier images from archaic art, Hermes was typically represented as a mature
ﬁgure with a beard, as continued to be the case when his head was portrayed on
herms. He appears with great frequency in Attic vase-paintings, whether as a leading
ﬁgure in exploits of his own or as an attendant ﬁgure, usually clad in the traveller’s
garb described above. From the latter part of the ﬁfth century BC onwards, his artistic
type changes in accordance with developments in sculpture, and he comes to be repre-
sented as a beardless and naked youth (ephe¯bos), not unlike his half-brother Apollo,
but younger and less muscular. It is thus that he is shown in the marvellous statue
by Praxiteles (born c. 390 BC) that is the chief glory of the museum at Olympia. Such
images of him were very often set up in the gymnasia and wrestling-schools (palais-
trai), and he came increasingly to be regarded as a special patron of adolescent youths
and their exercises. Hermes could also be portrayed in rustic guise as Kriophoros (the
Ram-bearer), carrying a ram in his arm or on his shoulders.
The legend of his birth is recounted in the Homeric Hymn to Hermes, which handles
the subject with the good-natured humour that beﬁts it; for few Greek gods mind
a harmless joke or two, and Hermes least of all. Zeus fathered him by Maia, a nymph
or daughter of Atlas (see p. 519), who lived in a remote cave on Mt Kyllene in
north-eastern Arcadia.83 At dawn he was born, so the Hymn tells us, by noon he
was playing on the lyre, and on that same evening he stole the cattle of Apollo.84
The details of the story may be a little obscure here and there, but the outlines 
are clear. Hermes leapt out of his cradle soon after he was born and walked out 
of his mother’s cave. On meeting a tortoise just outside, he was struck by a sudden
inspiration, and picked it up and took it into the cave to convert it into a musical
instrument. After killing it and scooping its ﬂesh out of its shell, he inserted two
curved horns into the leg-holes at one end of the shell, ﬁtted a cross-piece between

them, and stretched seven strings of sheep-gut back over the shell to create the ﬁrst
lyre. After singing an extempore song to its accompaniment, he returned to his
main purpose by setting off to steal the cattle of Apollo.85
Making his way to Pieria to the north of Mt Olympos – a very tolerable walk
for a baby – he stole ﬁfty cows from a herd belonging to Apollo, and drove them 
off, making them walk backwards to confuse anyone who tried to search for them.
He walked forwards for his own part, but concealed his tracks by wearing some
improvised sandals woven from twigs of myrtle and tamarisk.86 Later authors suggest
that he disguised the trail of the cattle by tying branches to their tails to act as
brushes, or by ﬁxing little boots over their hooves.87 He hurried south with 
the cattle through Thessaly and Central Greece, and then across the Isthmus to the
Peloponnese. When an old man who was tending his vineyard happened to see him
on the way at Onchestos in Boeotia, the god warned him that it was in his best
interest to keep silent on the matter.88 On reaching the river Alpheios in the western
Peloponnese on the same night, Hermes called a halt and kindled a ﬁre, inventing
ﬁre-sticks for the purpose; and he then slaughtered two of the cattle and divided
their ﬂesh into twelve portions to offer them in sacriﬁce to the Twelve Gods. As 
dawn was breaking, he ﬁnally returned to his mother’s cave at Kyllene, slipping 
in through the keyhole, and tucked himself up in his cradle, the very picture of 
baby innocence.89
Although Maia was not deceived and did her best to scold him, he retorted that
he merely wanted what was due to him as a divine son of Zeus, and would steal it
as best he may if it were not granted to him.90 Apollo arrived at the cave in a great
fury on the next day, having been put on the track by the old man at Onchestos,
and having recognized the identity of the thief through a bird-omen.91 Brushing
aside the bland assurances of Hermes, who claimed that he was too young even to
know what cattle were let alone to steal them, Apollo hauled him off to Zeus to
answer for his crime. After listening to a speech of consummate impudence from
the infant god, who swore that had never done anything wrong and was incapable
of telling a lie, Zeus laughed at his effrontery and ordered him to guide Apollo to
the stolen cattle forthwith.92 So he took Apollo to the cave where they were hidden,
in the region of Triphylian Pylos, and soon molliﬁed him by singing a song to the
accompaniment of the wonderful music of his lyre. Apollo was so entranced by 
the sound of the newly invented instrument that he agreed to surrender his cattle
in exchange for it; and after returning the cattle to their proper pastures, the two
gods went up to Olympos together.93 To console himself for the loss of his lyre,
Hermes invented a new and humbler instrument for himself, the shepherd’s pipes.
After demanding that Hermes should swear never to steal from him again, Apollo
swore to become his dearest friend and presented him with a three-branched golden
staff (possibly though not necessarily to be identiﬁed with the caduceus of Hermes).
Although Hermes also wanted to be taught the art of prophecy, Apollo explained
that the highest forms of the art were reserved for himself alone, and recommended
that he should consult three virgins called the Thriai who would be able to instruct
him in a subordinate form of divination, evidently the use of thriai or divining
pebbles. Zeus ordered for his part that Hermes should have dominion over trade,
and beasts and ﬂocks, and be appointed his messenger to Hades.94
— The younger Olympian gods and goddesses —
162

Since the Thriai are described in the Hymn as winged sisters who ﬂew hither and thither,
fed on honeycomb, and were inspired to speak the truth through the eating of honey, it
seems that they may have been imagined as being partly bee-like in form. They lived under
a ridge of Mt Parnassos.95 Later sources have nothing of substance to add except that
Pherecydes described them as daughters of Zeus.96
The early lyric poet Alcaeus offered an account of the juvenile exploits of Hermes,
but little is recorded of it beyond the fact that Hermes contrived to steal the 
quiver of Apollo while that god was trying to scare him into returning the stolen
cattle.97 A substantial portion of Sophocles’ Trackers (Ichneutai), a Satyr-play based 
on the same body of legend, has been recovered from papyri; this is a burlesque in
which Seilenos leads a chorus of Satyrs in pursuit of the infant cattle-thief on Apollo’s
behalf. Apollodorus’ summary of the young god’s adventures conﬂicts with the
Homeric Hymn in certain details. Hermes’ invention of the lyre is delayed, for
instance, until after his theft of the cattle, and he is thus able to use gut from the
two slaughtered cattle to make the strings. In this account, furthermore, Apollo
covets Hermes’ second musical invention, the shepherd’s pipes, and offers him 
the golden staff in exchange for it; but Hermes demands to receive the art of
divination in addition, and Apollo teaches him the use of divining-pebbles for 
that reason.98
The old man who saw Hermes passing with the cattle was sometimes named as
BATTOS (Chatterbox) and was said to have been turned to stone as a punishment
for his chattering. The story is recounted in the following way by Antoninus
Liberalis, whose main source was probably the Hellenistic poet Nicander (although
he also cites other authors including Hesiod). Apollo was distracted at the time 
of the cattle-theft because he had fallen in love with Hymenaios (see p. 223, here
described as a son of Magnes) and was never out of his home for long. Hermes took
advantage of his absence to drive away a hundred of his cows along with twelve
heifers and a bull, after ﬁrst putting the guard-dogs to sleep (presumably with his
wand). Battos, who lived on a crag in Arcadia, noticed the cattle passing and
demanded a reward for his silence. Although Battos swore to keep his side of the
bargain, Hermes mistrusted him and came back in disguise to test him as soon as
he had hidden the cattle; and Battos duly betrayed the secret in return for a woollen
cloak. To punish his perﬁdy, the god turned him to stone with a touch of his wand.
This story provides an explanation for the name of some crags in Arcadia known as
the Battou Skopiai (the peaks or look-out-points of Battos).99 Ovid offers a compar-
able story, stating that Battos was an old man who tended the mares of Neleus (the
king of Pylos in Messenia, see p. 424). After receiving a cow from Hermes as the
price for his silence, Battos betrayed the secret when the god returned in disguise
and bribed him to talk by promising him a bull and a cow. In this case, Hermes
turned him to ﬂint.100
Although Hermes engaged in love affairs with some mortal women, notably
Philonis (see p. 435) and Herse (see p. 366), and was said to have fathered various
children by such liaisons, he never married, nor is he linked to any goddess in early
myth.

It was doubtless inevitable that the bisexual godling HERMAPHRODITOS should have
come to be described as a son of Hermes and Aphrodite. The cult of this strange being 
was probably derived from the Cypriot cult of Aphroditos, the bearded male Aphrodite; 
the earliest deﬁnite evidence for his cult in mainland Greece is provided by an Attic dedica-
tion from the early fourth century BC. Diodorus, the ﬁrst author to refer to him as a son 
of Hermes, seems to consider that he was a hermaphrodite from the time of his birth.101
Ovid recounts a legend, however, which explains his distinctive form by saying that he had
been a handsome young man who had fused with an amorous water-nymph. Hermaphroditos,
as he was called after his parents, was reared by naiad nymphs in the caves of Mt Ida in 
the Troad, but left home at the age of ﬁfteen to wander through Asia Minor. When he reached
Caria in the south-west, Salmakis, the nymph of a spring in that area, fell violently in love
with him when she saw him approaching her pool. Although the ignorant youth was simply
embarrassed when she made direct advances to him, she gained her opportunity when he
jumped into her waters to bathe. Seizing him in a tight embrace, she prayed that the two of
them should be united forever, and they were fused into a single being who shared the
characteristics of both sexes. On observing the change that he had undergone, Herma-
phroditos prayed to his divine parents, asking that any man who bathed there in the future
should be robbed of his virility.102 The spring of Salmakis, which lay at Halicarnassus, was
credited with these enervating powers in historical times. Although this is Hermaphroditos’
only proper myth, he appears quite often in art. During the Hellenistic era, when Greek artists
came to be increasingly attracted to anomalous and pathetic subjects, this ambiguous ﬁgure
was in high favour, and numerous representations, many having a morbid beauty, have
survived. He has the genitals of a man but the breasts and general build of a woman.
Pan was commonly classed as a son of Hermes (see p. 215), as is understandable since he
resembled Pan in certain respects, as a pastoral god who had special connections with Arcadia.
According to a minor aetiological tale, Hermes once seized Hekate while he was out hunting
and tried to rape her, but was deterred when she shrieked out in rage (enebrime¯sato), hence
the goddess’s title of Brimo.103
The Italians identiﬁed Hermes with Mercurius (Mercury), whose name indicates in
Latin that he was a god of merchants and their wares; Mercurius was often repre-
sented with similar attributes to those of Hermes, and apparently originated as a
Roman offshoot of the Greek god.
HEPHAISTOS
It has been shown pretty convincingly that HEPHAISTOS, who has a non-Greek
name, was a god of foreign and probably Asiatic origin. Although he was little
worshipped on the Greek mainland except at Athens, his cult was of some import-
ance in Asia Minor and the adjoining islands, and also the Greek colonies in the
volcanic regions of Italy and Sicily. In Asia Minor, he was particularly associated
with Lycia in the south-west, and above all the region of the Lycian Olympos, which
was remarkable for the presence of large quantities of natural gas; he appears to
have been the principal god of Phaselis, the main coastal city of that region. It has
been suggested that he may have originated as a ﬁre-god among the native peoples
of Lycia, and that his cult may have spread from this original centre not only to
other areas of the Anatolian mainland, but also to adjacent islands, especially Lemnos,
— The younger Olympian gods and goddesses —
164

whose mountain, Moschylos, is volcanic though long extinct. The city of Hephaistias
on the north coast of the island was named after Hephaistos, and an ancient myth
that was already known to Homer presented him as having fallen to earth on the
island (see below). As a deity who was associated with ﬁre, he was pictured as a
divine blacksmith from a very early period, and various places came to be identi-
ﬁed as the site of his underground forge, wherever its presence could be inferred
from extensive emissions of ﬁre and smoke. When his cult was transferred to the
volcanic regions of the west, the Aeolian (Lipari) islands near Sicily came to be
connected with him, and also to some extent Sicily itself and southern Campania.
In mainland Greece, Hephaistos was worshipped with considerable zeal in Attica,
which was home to many craftsmen whose trades depended on the use of ﬁre, but
hardly at all anywhere else even if he was universally familiar as a god of myth.
In Homer, he is a fully accredited Olympian, a son of Hera. Although she appar-
ently bore him as a child of her marriage in the Homeric view,104 Hesiod and most
later authors agree that she brought him to birth without prior intercourse with
Zeus, by way of a counter-miracle because she was angry with Zeus for having
brought Athena to birth from his head.105 According to two conﬂicting tales that
are recounted in different parts of the Iliad, he was thrown out of heaven during
his younger days, either by his mother or by Zeus. In one account, he was lame
from birth and Hera threw him out because she was ashamed of his deformity; 
and when he landed in the sea below, he was rescued by Thetis and the Okeanid

The return of Hephaistos to Olympos.

Eurynome, who sheltered him in their cave beneath the Ocean for nine years. He
repaid them for their care and protection by fashioning all manner of ﬁne jewellery
as the Ocean roared around outside.106 Or in the other Homeric account, Zeus cast
him out when he tried to intervene on his mother’s behalf during one of his parents’
many quarrels. On this occasion he alighted on Lemnos after falling all day, and
was kindly received by the Sintians (Sinties), as the inhabitants are called in the
Iliad. Although Homer says nothing deﬁnite on the matter, he was presumably
lamed by his fall in this version (as is explicitly stated in some later accounts of the
story).107 According to a tale that can be traced well back into the archaic period,
Hephaistos avenged his mother’s action by sending her a golden throne that tied
her fast by means of invisible cords when she sat on it. Although Ares and a succes-
sion of other gods tried to persuade him to return home to set her free, he refused
to do so until Dionysos managed to bring him back in a drunken state after plying
him with wine.108 He can be seen in vase-paintings riding back to Olympos on an
ithyphallic ass in the company of nymphs and Seilenoi.
As a limping god who toiled at a grimy craft, the Hephaistos of myth was not
a ﬁgure of the highest dignity. Even in Homer, he is rather a ﬁgure of fun, at whose
clumsy activities the gods laugh unquenchably (hence the proverbial phrase ‘Homeric
laughter’) as he serves them at table.109 His usual workshop in the early tradition
lay neither on Lemnos nor anywhere else on the earth below, but in his house of
bronze on Olympos where he fashioned marvellous objects of every kind,110 some
that were magical and some that were merely intricate and beautiful, ranging 
from the golden automata that helped him as servants in his house to armour of
unparalleled splendour for the gods or specially favoured mortals. From the classical
period onwards, his forge is located at various places in the everyday world. It was
sometimes placed on Lemnos, where the blinded Orion was supposed to have 
visited it and to have received assistance from the god (see p. 563);111 but since
Lemnos had no active volcano, most authors preferred to imagine that the divine
forge lay in the west, either under Mt Etna in Sicily112 or under a volcano in the
Aeolian islands to the north,113 hence the ﬂames and smoke that arose from them.
In contrast to Homer, who presents Hephaistos as working on his own (with some
help from his automata and a semi-automatic bellows), authors from Callimachus
onwards provide him with assistants in the form of the Kyklopes, the primordial
beings who had armed Zeus with his thunderbolt (see p. 66).114 This furnished a
pleasing theme for poets and artists, who loved to portray Hephaistos in his under-
ground forge with his soot-blackened workmen around him, endlessly busy with
divine tasks – preparing thunderbolts for Zeus, arrows for Artemis, arms for some
favoured hero.
The creations of Hephaistos fall into three main classes. In the ﬁrst place, he was a master-
architect who created splendid homes for himself and all the other gods on Olympos.115 It
should be remembered in this connection that imperishable divine buildings were thought
to be made of bronze, in part or in whole. The Iliad indicates, however, that his skills
extended to masonry by referring to porticoes of polished stone that that he erected at the
palace of Zeus.116 He had an eye for detail too, for he made tightly closing doors for Hera’s
— The younger Olympian gods and goddesses —
166

bedroom with a secret bolt which could be opened by no other god.117 Down on earth, he
erected a bronze temple of Apollo at Delphi, which was supposed to have stood there before
the ﬁrst stone temple was erected by the legendary builders Trophonios and Agamedes (see
p. 558). There was disagreement on whether this bronze temple had burned down or been
swallowed up in a chasm (which would surely be more plausible).118
In the second place, Hephaistos was a craftsman with superhuman capacities who could
create automata that acted of their own accord. We are told in the Iliad that he was assisted
in his house by maidens of gold who possessed understanding, speech and strength; and he
also made tripods that were ﬁtted with ears and wheels, and could make their way to and
from the gatherings of the gods at his command.119 The Odyssey adds that he fashioned dogs
of gold and silver to guard the palace of Alkinoos.120 Later sources refer to further automata,
such as Talos, a bronze giant who was guarded the coast of Crete (see p. 396), and a golden
dog that guarded a shrine of Zeus on the island (see p. 502), and golden singing ﬁgures
that stood on the pediment of the Delphian temple mentioned above.
And third, Hephaistos made splendid arms and armour, and jewellery and other ﬁne
artefacts, which sometimes remained in the possession of the gods but are generally more
important in myth if they enter the possession of mortals. The armour of Achilles (see 
p. 464), the breast-plate of Diomedes, and the sceptre of Agamemnon (see p. 396) may be
mentioned from the Iliad,121 and the necklace of Harmonia (see p. 297), the crown of Ariadne
(see p. 397), and the sword of Peleus (see p. 534) from later sources. In a looser sense, any
strange or wonderful object that makes an appearance in heroic legend, from the under-
ground house of Oinopion (see p. 563) to the bronze-hooved cattle of Aietes, could be
described as ‘Hephaistos-made’ (Hephaistoteuktos).
A particularly useful creation of Hephaistos was the golden cup that he made for the sun-
god Helios to carry him around the streams of Ocean from the place of his setting to that
of his rising (see p. 44); in an early account by the lyric poet Mimnermus, this hollow golden
bowl (or ‘bed’ as it is called here) is ﬁtted with wings and presumably has some power of
self-motion.122
Various myths, all recounted elsewhere, present Hephaistos as putting his powers
of craftsmanship to good use in various ways. Zeus charged him with the creation
of the ﬁrst woman, Pandora, whom he moulded from moistened clay (see p. 94).
He split the head of Zeus with an axe to ease the birth of Athena (see p. 181). In
a famous story from the Odyssey in which Aphrodite is considered to be his wife, he
catches her in adultery with Ares by laying a ﬁne-woven net across his bed (see 
p. 201). There is no indication otherwise in early literature or art that he was thought
to be married to Aphrodite; the Theogony points to another union of opposites, stating
that he was married to Aglaia, the youngest of the Graces, and the Iliad suggests
similarly that he was married to Charis (Grace personiﬁed).123 For the story of his
attempted rape of Athena, which resulted in the birth of Erichthonios, see 
p. 184. His other mortal children are minor ﬁgures who are identiﬁed as sons of
his either on account of their lameness, as in the case of Periphetes (see p. 342) and
the Argonaut Palaimonios,124 or of their manual skills, as in the case of Ardalos, a
legendary builder and musician of Troizen.125
In Rome, Hephaistos was identiﬁed with Volcanus (Vulcan), though not very
appropriately, since Hephaistos became a smith-god and is hardly remembered in any
other capacity, whereas Volcanus was the god of destroying ﬁre, which he remained
in his native cult, and had nothing to do with its productive applications.

ARES
ARES, the god of war, was a god of lesser stature than one might expect, above all
because he represented the more brutal aspects of warfare – battle-frenzy and
slaughter and strife as enjoyed for their own sakes. His name seems to have origi-
nated as an ancient word for war or battle, and he can virtually be regarded as
bellicosity personiﬁed. Disciplined courage and chivalry were not his concern. He
is portrayed in a most unﬂattering light from the time of Homer onwards, as a god
who is disdained by other members of the Olympian circle; when he complains to
his father in the Iliad after Diomedes has wounded him in battle, Zeus tells him
not to sit and whine at his feet, saying that he ﬁnds him the most hateful of all
the gods who inhabit Olympos, for he delights in nothing other than strife, war
and slaughter.126 Ares never developed into a god of social, moral or theological
importance, in this respect contrasting sharply not only with Apollo but with the
Italian Mars, with whom he was identiﬁed in Graeco-Roman cult and legend; for
Mars had agricultural as well as warlike functions, however he came by them, and,
at least in the Augustan cult of Mars Ultor, he was capable of embodying the idea
of righteous vengeance, while his Greek counterpart was no more than a divine
swashbuckler. This wild god lived in a suitably wild territory, the northern land of
Thrace, which was noted for its savage, warlike peoples; in the Iliad, he sets out
from Thrace when he comes to join battle, and he hurries off to Thrace in the Odyssey
after he is caught in adultery by Hephaistos.127 It is far from certain, however, that
he was actually a god of Thracian origin as has often been supposed.
Doubtless because he is pictured as a butcher and berserker rather than a brave 
and self-controlled warrior, Ares quite often gets the worst of it in his martial encoun-
ters. Diomedes wounds him in the Iliad, as has been mentioned, with a little help
from Athena, causing him to scream as loudly as nine or ten thousand men in battle
and then ﬂee up to heaven.128 Athena herself treats him with some contempt in the
battle of the gods later in the poem, felling him with a huge stone in a single blow,
and mocking him for having presumed to match his strength against hers.129
He engages more directly with mortals in battle than is usual for gods, and is even
presented as stripping the armour from a fallen Greek warrior on one occasion.130
According to the Hesiodic Shield, Herakles defeated him twice over, ﬁrst bringing
him to the ground with a thigh-wound during the ﬁghting at Pylos (see p. 278), and
later doing so again in single combat when he was attacked by Ares after killing his
son Kyknos (see p. 283).131 A humiliation of a rather different kind was imposed on
him by the Aloadai, who imprisoned him in a bronze jar for thirteen months, 
and might even have caused his destruction if Hermes had not come to his rescue 
(see p. 92); this too is an ancient legend, for it is mentioned in the Iliad.132
Ares has a number of associates who accompany him into battle in the Iliad,
including the female war-deity Enyo (sacker of cities) who is sometimes described
as his mother or daughter.133 Although Enyalios is no more than an epithet of Ares
in Homer, he is sometimes distinguished as a separate god in later sources. He was
certainly a very ancient ﬁgure since his name already appears on Mycenaean tablets.
He was honoured in cult at various places, notably at Sparta, where his statue was 
— The younger Olympian gods and goddesses —
168

kept enchained to ensure that the Spartans would never be deserted by him, and
the boys used to sacriﬁce puppies to him before the ritual ﬁght at the Platanistas.134
At Rome, he was commonly identiﬁed with Quirinus, an ancient god who had
martial functions, while Enyo was identiﬁed with Bellona. Various personiﬁcations
also accompany Ares in the Iliad, his ‘comrade and sister’ Eris135 (Strife, who is a
daughter of Night and the mother of many unappealing children in the Theogony,
see pp. 30–1), and Deimos and Phobos (Panic and Fear), and Kydoimos, who
personiﬁes the din and confusion of battle,136 and the Ker or Death-spirit, whose
cloak is red with human blood.137
According to the Theogony, Ares fathered three children by Aphrodite, the above-
mentioned Deimos and Phobos, ‘terrible gods who strike confusion into the 
close-packed ranks of men in numbing war’, and a goddess of very different char-
acter, the gracious Harmonia, who became the wife of Kadmos, king of Thebes (see
p. 297).138 Ares was associated with Aphrodite from early times as a lover and cult-
partner (see p. 201); for Homer’s story of how Hephaistos, here exceptionally
described as her husband, humiliated the pair by trapping them together during an
assignation, see p. 201. Simonides and some later authors suggest that Aphrodite 
also bore Eros to Ares139 (which would be appropriate enough, seeing that Ares 
loved the goddess and Eros waited upon her; but there were many other accounts 
of Eros’ origin). As often with Poseidon, Ares was thought to be a suitable father 
for heroes of a savage or bellicose nature, such as Diomedes of Thrace and Kyknos,
two notable adversaries of Herakles (see pp. 262 and 282), and Tereus of Thrace who
raped and mutilated his sister-in-law (see p. 368), and others who will be mentioned
later. In a looser sense, any warlike hero could be described as a scion of Ares.
Although Homer has a fair amount to say about Ares, especially in the ﬁfth book
of the Iliad, he rarely appears in mythical narratives thereafter, even where war and
carnage are involved. The one major story in which he does play an important part

is the Theban foundation-myth, since the founder, Kadmos, kills his sacred dragon
(which is even described as his son in some accounts) and has to appease him 
before he can found the city (see pp. 295ff). After they are reconciled, the god offers
his daughter Harmonia to Kadmos in marriage; but in some accounts his anger is
long-lasting (see p. 330 for instance). He was otherwise closely associated with the
Amazons, as their main god and as the father of prominent Amazons (or even of
the entire race), and was said to have given his name to the Athenian high court 
of the Areiopagos after he was brought before it to be tried for murder in the ﬁrst
trial ever to be held there (see pp. 365–6).
DIONYSOS
Although it was once assumed that it had been settled almost beyond question that
DIONYSOS, the god of wine and ecstasy, was a deity of foreign origin who arrived
in Greece at a relatively late period, this can no longer be taken for granted.
According to the traditional argument, he was introduced into Greece from Thrace
after perhaps originating in Asia Minor, and his late irruption into the Greek scene
is reﬂected in some of his most characteristic myths that tell how he had to over-
come determined resistance in various parts of Greece. It has often been thought
signiﬁcant, furthermore, that he is barely mentioned by Homer (even if the poet
knows something of his wild rites and his conﬂict with Lykourgos of Thrace). 
Some of the more recent archaeological evidence seems to point in another direction,
however, suggesting that the name and cult of Dionysos could be of Mycenaean
origin. His name has been found on Linear B tablets from Pylos in the Peloponnese;
and he was apparently honoured without break at the sanctuary of Ayia Irini on
Keos (an Aegean island to the south-east of Attica) from the early Mycenaean 
period into Greek times. It has also been pointed out that the Dionysian festival 
of the Anthesteria must have originated before the Ionian migration (c. 1000 BC),
and that there is reason to suppose that the Dionysian festival of the Lenaia was of
very ancient origin too.140 As regards the name of Dionysos, its ﬁrst syllable
evidently refers to the sky-god (Zeus, genitive Dios), but the meaning of the rest is
uncertain. It has been suggested that there may have been a word nysos (akin to
Latin nurus or Greek ν
ς) meaning ‘child’ or ‘son’, or else that this component 
of the name was connected with the legendary Nysa where the god was said to 
have been reared.
Zeus and Semele, and the birth and infancy of 
their son Dionysos
There is no doubt about the origin of the name of Dionysos’ mother SEMELE, for
it is nothing but a Greek modiﬁcation of that of the Thraco-Phrygian earth-goddess
Zemelo. In Greek myth, however, she is fully mortal, as one of the four daughters
of Kadmos, king of Thebes (see p. 298). Zeus fell in love with her and used to visit
her in secret at night, exciting the jealousy of Hera, who plotted her rival’s destruc-
tion. Appearing to her in the form of her aged nurse Beroe, Hera congratulated her
— The younger Olympian gods and goddesses —
170

on the exalted rank of her lover, but advised her to impose a test on him to prove
that he was Zeus and truly loved her: let him appear to her in all the splendour of
his divinity, just as he would appear to his lawful divine consort.141 Or in another
version, Hera suggested that this was the only way in which she could come to
experience the full pleasure of intercourse with a god.142 So Semele persuaded Zeus
to promise her any favour she chose (or took advantage of a promise that he had
already made to that effect) and demanded that he should come to her just as he
came to Hera. He reluctantly agreed, and swept into her bedroom in a chariot to
the accompaniment of thunder and lightning; but her human frailty could not
endure his Olympian glory, and she died of fright and was burned to ashes. Before
her body was fully consumed, however, Zeus snatched her sixth- or seventh-month
child from her womb, and sewed it into his own thigh, from where it was subse-
quently brought to birth at the fulﬁlment of the normal time of gestation. Some
claimed that the child was already deiﬁed by contact with the divine ﬁre. As for
the unfortunate Semele, she was later rescued from the Underworld by her son and
taken up to Olympos to become the goddess Thyone.143
After his extraordinary birth, which may be compared to that of Athena from
Zeus’s head, Dionysos had to be provided with a nurse or nurses. The Homeric Hymn
(1) to Dionysos observes that there were conﬂicting traditions about the place of his

birth, which was located at his mother’s home-city of Thebes, or on Naxos (an island
that was specially associated with the god), or by the river Alpheios in the
Peloponnese, or at other places besides; but there is no truth in any of this, 
so the poet asserts, for Zeus brought him to birth far away from men and in secret
from Hera on Nysa, a lofty mountain in Phoenicia. The Homeric Hymn (26) to Dionysos
states similarly that Zeus entrusted his son to the nymphs of Nysa, who reared him
in a sweet-smelling cave on the mountain.144 In some accounts, Zeus asked Hermes
to convey the child to the nymphs of Nysa.145 This mysterious place is already
mentioned in connection with Dionysos in the Iliad, which states that Lykourgos
(see below) chased ‘the nurses of mad Dionysos down over the sacred mountain of
Nysa’.146 Ancient scholars offered all manner of conjectures about the location of
this legendary mountain; the lexicographer Hesychius writes that it is ‘not conﬁned
to any one place; we ﬁnd it in Arabia, Ethiopia, Egypt, Babylon, Erythra (the Red
Sea?), Thrace, Thessaly, Cilicia, India, Libya, Lydia, Macedonia, Naxos, the neigh-
bourhood of Mt Pangaion, and at a place in Syria’.147 Wherever the nymphs of Nysa
may have lived and whoever they were, they nursed Dionysos faithfully and became
his companions and followers. According to Ovid, he repaid their kindness by
renewing their youth when they grew old; or else he rewarded them by placing
them in the heavens as the star-cluster of the Hyades.148
One of Semele’s sisters, Ino, the wife of the Boeotian ruler Athamas (see p. 420),
is also named as a nurse of the infant Dionysos. The mythographers reconciled the
two accounts by suggesting that the nymphs reared him initially but later passed
him on to Ino for fear of Hera’s anger, or, conversely, that Ino reared him initially
until she and her husband were driven mad by Hera.149 According to Apollodorus,
who offers the latter version, Hermes brought the new-born Dionysos to Ino 
and Athamas and persuaded them to rear him as a girl; but when the couple were
subsequently driven mad by Hera, Zeus rescued him from the goddess’s anger by
transforming him into a kid, and the divine messenger then passed him on to the
Nysaian nymphs. The couple paid a heavy price for their services to Dionysos in
any case, since the maddened Ino threw their younger son into a boiling cauldron
and jumped into the sea with him, while Athamas hunted down their eldest son
in the delusion that he was a deer; see further on p. 421.
The people of Brasiai or Prasiai, a town on the eastern seaboard of Laconia, offered their
own distinctive account of the birth and childhood of Dionysos. In contrast to the other
Greeks, they claimed that Semele had survived to give birth to him in the normal way, and
that her father had enclosed her in a chest with her new-born child and had cast it into the
sea. When the chest drifted ashore at Brasiai, Semele was found to be dead, but Dionysos
was safe and sound. By a convenient chance, Ino happened to pass by and asked to take care
of her nephew; she reared him there in a grotto which was shown to visitors as the scene
of his childhood. A patch of level ground known as the garden of Dionysos stretched in
front of it. The setting adrift of an erring daughter and her child is a standard motif in
Greek myth, as can be seen in the story of Danae and Perseus (see p. 239) or Rhoio and
Anios (see p. 569). A child who survives such an ordeal is marked out for a special destiny.
The present tale diverges from others of the kind in one signiﬁcant respect, that the mother
fails to survive; for it was so ﬁrmly established that Semele had died leaving Dionysos an
orphan that the framers of the local myth accepted this into their story.150

Myths in which Dionysos exacts terrible vengeance on 
mortals who reject him and his rites
Some of the most characteristic myths of the mature Dionysos are those in which he
suffers persecution from mortals who refuse to acknowledge his divinity and 
try to suppress his rites when he ﬁrst introduces them into their land. It hardly 
needs saying that those who venture to oppose him soon come to a bad end. 
One such myth is already recounted by Homer, who tells how LYKOURGOS, son
of Dryas, once chased the nurses of Dionysos down from the sacred mountain of Nysa,
striking them with an ox-goad and causing the god himself to plunge beneath the
sea in terror. Dionysos was consoled, however, by the goddess Thetis, and Lykourgos
paid a heavy price for his impious behaviour, for he was struck blind by Zeus ‘and
lived not long thereafter, for he had become hateful to the deathless gods’.151 In
subsequent accounts of this story, and in other myths of this kind, Dionysos is quite
capable of looking after himself. According to Apollodorus, Dionysos took refuge
beneath the sea when Lykourgos tried to expel him, and the Bacchants and Satyrs of
his retinue were taken captive by his persecutor; but his followers were suddenly
released thereafter (evidently through his miraculous intervention), and he drove
Lykourgos mad. In his frenzy, Lykourgos killed his son Dryas in the belief that he
was pruning a vine; and when his land was subsequently struck by a famine, his
people caused his death at the bidding of an oracle by tying him up and exposing
him on Mt Pangaion, where he was destroyed by horses. It is stated that this was the
ﬁrst occasion on which Dionysos was insulted and expelled by a mortal.152
Post-Homeric sources report that Lykourgos was the king of the Edonians in the northern land
of Thrace.153 His story varies considerably in different accounts; in that of Hyginus, for
instance, he raped his mother in a ﬁt of drunkenness after denying the divinity of Dionysos;
and during his madness, he killed not only his son but his wife too, and cut off one of his feet
in the delusion that it was a vine. He then met his own death at the hand of Dionysos himself,
who threw him to his panthers on Mt Rhodope in Thrace.154 Hyginus also refers to a version
in which Lykourgos took his own life while in the grip of his madness.155 In a chorus from
Sophocles’ Antigone, by contrast, it is suggested that he was merely imprisoned in a cave until
his madness subsided.156 The early epic poet Eumelus apparently offered a similar account to
that of Homer, except that he stated that Lykourgos was acting at the incitation of Hera.157
According to Stesichorus, Dionysos had once received a golden urn from Hephaistos after
entertaining him on Naxos; and when Thetis offered him a kindly welcome under the sea 
after he was pursued by Lykourgos, he repaid her by giving her this urn, which would later
hold the ashes of her son Achilles.158
The most famous of these opposition myths, and one of the most violent, is the
Theban tale of PENTHEUS, which forms the subject of one of Euripides’ ﬁnest
plays, the Bacchae. Dionysos visited Thebes in anger because the three sisters of his
mother Semele had denied that he was truly a son of Zeus; for they claimed that
Semele had invented the story to conceal a love affair with a mortal, and that Zeus
had struck her dead to punish her for her lie.159 On his arrival, Dionysos manifested
his powers by driving the three sisters mad along with the other women of the city,
and causing them all to roam over Mt Kithairon as Bacchants. Thebes was now
under the rule of Pentheus, who was the son of Agave, one of the princesses who

had caused the trouble, and a grandson of the founder Kadmos. Believing that the
new god was an impostor, Pentheus vigorously opposed his rites, paying no heed
to the warnings of the seer Teiresias or of Kadmos (who was still living at the
Theban court in his old age). When his guards brought in Dionysos, who was
pretending for the moment to be no more than a votary of the god, he cross-exam-
ined him and ordered that he should be imprisoned in the stables of the palace.160
But Dionysos escaped with ease, provoked an earthquake as a demonstration of his
powers, and then appeared once again in front of his supposed captor. Impressed
and yet still hostile, Pentheus allowed his extraordinary visitor to persuade him to
disguise himself as a woman and to set off for the mountain to see with his own
eyes what the followers of Dionysos were doing.161 As he was spying on the women
from high up in a pine-tree, Dionysos incited them to attack him, and they
surrounded the tree, pushed it over, and tore him to pieces. His mother Agave, who
took a leading part in the assault, ran back to the palace with his severed head in
the delusion that he had been a mountain lion.162 Not until later, when her frenzy
subsided, did she realize what she had done. The play ends as she and her sisters
depart into exile at the order of Dionysos, whose revenge is now complete.163
In another Boeotian tale of this kind, the MINYADES, the three daughters of
Minyas, king of Orchomenos (see p. 558), also suffered a grim punishment for
holding out against the new cult. When the other women of the city left their
homes to roam the mountains as Bacchants, the three industrious princesses, who
are named as Leukippe, Alkathoe (or Alkithoe) and Arsippe (or Arsinoe), disap-
proved of their unruly behaviour and preferred to sit at home at their looms.
Although Dionysos himself appeared to them in the form of a young girl to urge
them not to neglect his rites and mysteries, they spurned his advice. Angered by
their obduracy, the god demonstrated his powers by transforming himself succes-
sively into a bull, a lion and a leopard, and by causing milk and nectar to drip from
the frames of their looms. Overcome by terror at the sight of these prodigies, the
three girls cast lots to see who should offer sacriﬁce to the god; and when the lot
fell on Leukippe, the three of them joined together to tear her young son Hippasos
to pieces. They then ran out to join the Bacchants on the mountainside, where
Hermes touched them with his wand to transform them into a bat and two different
forms of owl.164 Or in another version in which Dionysos offered them no direct
warning, the god caused ivy and vines to envelop their looms, and snakes to appear
in their wool-baskets, and wine and milk to drip from the ceiling. When he then
proceeded to send them mad, they tore the son of Leukippe to pieces as though he
were a young fawn, and rushed off to join the other women who had been under
the god’s power from the beginning; but the women chased them away because
they were polluted by their crime, and they were transformed into a crow, a bat
and an owl.165 Ovid alters the story signiﬁcantly, transferring the sisters to Thebes,
omitting the rending of Hippasos, and having them transformed into bats inside
the house.166
There were also notable myths in the Argolid in which Dionysos either afﬂicted
all the women of the land with madness or else just the Proitides, the three daughters
of Proitos, king of Tiryns. The tradition is rather complicated in this case since the
Proitides were also said to have suffered this fate because they had offended Hera,
— The younger Olympian gods and goddesses —
174

and it would seem that two tales of separate origin regarding the princesses and the
Argive women respectively came to be confused (and also combined). It is likely
that only the more general outbreak was associated with Dionysos in the ﬁrst place.
Since the madness of the Argive women and of the Proitides too in most accounts
was said to have been cured by the great seer Melampous, this myth will be exam-
ined in connection with the history of his family in Chapter 12 (see pp. 428–9).
Some lesser tales of resistance are worthy of passing mention. One is a cultic legend that
was offered to explain the origin of the cult of Dionysos Melanaigis (of the black goat-skin)
at Eleutherai on the borders of Attica and Boeotia. When the daughters of Eleuther, the
eponymous founder of the town, were granted a vision of Dionysos in a black goat-skin,
they greeted it with scorn, causing such anger to the god that he drove them mad. At the
order of an oracle, their father then founded the above-mentioned cult so as to appease the
god and bring an end to their madness.167 Ovid states in passing that Akrisios, the grand-
father of Perseus, once shut the god out of his city of Argos and suffered as a consequence;168
and it was said that Dionysos caused Telephos to trip over a vine-branch as he was being
pursued by Achilles, and so suffer a grievous wound (see p. 446), because he had refused to
pay the god the honours that were due to him.169
According to a very strange Argive legend, Dionysos attacked Argos in the time of Perseus
with a force of women from the Aegean islands known as the Sea-women; but Perseus
defeated them in battle, killing most of the women, whose common grave could be seen in
Argos in historical times.170 In some accounts, Perseus even killed Dionysos himself, either
during the ﬁghting or by hurling him into the bottomless lake at Lerna;171 or else Perseus
and the Argives established good relations with Dionysos after the war and offered him high
honour.172
In the preceding myths that tell of the coming of Dionysos, people are regularly
sent mad by the god, and some are even torn to pieces by women under his inﬂuence.
The god himself was commonly imagined as roaming at the head of a revel-rout of
followers, some semi-divine and some human, Satyrs, Seilenoi and nymphs, and 
as his human votaries, women known as Maenads (Mainades, literally ‘mad-women’),
Bacchantes (Bakchai in Greek, Bacchae in Latin) or Thuiades (i.e. women possessed,
inspired). The women were also known as Bassarides, probably ‘wearers of fox-skins’
after one form of their ritual costume, another being the skin of a fawn. They regu-
larly perform curious miracles, making fountains of milk or wine spring up from
the ground; they are madly strong, able to tear goats, bulls and human beings to
pieces with their bare hands; ﬁre will not burn them nor weapons harm them; and
despite their violence to various animals, they have a deep sympathy with them,
often suckling kids, fawns and so forth. All this, wild as it sounds, is but an ideal-
ization of the enthusiastic ritual of the god. His worshippers sought, by ecstatic
dancing and perhaps also the use of wine, to become possessed by their god; they
were then called after one of his numerous names,173 Bakchai, from Bakchos. Tales
in which they rend and devour an animal (or even human) victim were also founded
in fact; these wild sacriﬁces were due to a desire to assimilate the god himself, who
was conceived sometimes as human in form, sometimes as bestial, his most common
manifestations being the bull and the goat, although he often appears as a serpent.
He was in fact a god of the fertility of nature; and even if he tended to become a

wine-god and god of ecstasy principally, he was never restricted to that sphere. The
nature-spirits who belonged to his retinue will be discussed along with the nymphs
in the next chapter (see pp. 212ff). Although it is certainly possible that the rites
of Dionysos may have met with real opposition here and there, it would be unwise
to interpret the opposition myths in any simple historical sense; they express some-
thing essential about his permanent nature as a god whose epiphany subverts the
norms of everyday morality and civic society.174
The myth of Ikarios and Erigone
Of stories in which Dionysos is shown as peacefully spreading his gifts, the most
famous is the Attic legend of IKARIOS, which is set in the days of Pandion I, an
early mythical king of Athens (see p. 368). Even here the god’s advent has baneful
consequences for those whom he visits. Ikarios was a humble farmer who lived in
the country outside Athens with his unmarried daughter ERIGONE. One day, he
received a visit from Dionysos, who gave him a vine-cutting and instructed him in
the art of wine-making. After growing some vines from the cutting and preparing
the ﬁrst vintage of wine, Ikarios loaded some wine-skins on to a cart and set off to
spread the gift of Dionysos to the people of Attica; or in a simpler version of the
story, the god simply gave him some wine and he set off with it immediately.175
On reaching Marathon in the north-east of the province (or Hymettos to the south
of Athens), Ikarios distributed some wine to the local peasants, who were delighted
with it at ﬁrst and drank down quantities of it without thinking to water it. 
When they became intoxicated, however, they thought that Ikarios had poisoned or
bewitched them and clubbed him to death; or when some of them fell to the ground
in a drunken stupor, their companions suspected the worst and killed Ikarios. 
They threw his body into a ditch, or buried it under a tree. It so happened that 
he had been accompanied by the family dog, Maira, which rushed home in distress 
and guided Erigone to the site, pulling at her dress. On discovering that her father
was dead, Erigone was so grief-stricken that she hanged herself; and the dog met
its own death soon afterwards, either because it hurled itself into a well in its grief, 
or because it died of starvation while guarding Erigone’s body.176
Dionysos was naturally enraged by these events, and responded in familiar manner
by driving the girls of Attica mad, so that they proceeded to hang themselves just
as Erigone had done. Some said that Erigone had prayed before her death that the
daughters of the Athenians should perish just as she had until the murderers were
punished. It is also stated in some accounts that Athens was struck by a plague,
either as the sole disaster or in addition to the epidemic of suicides. When the
Athenians consulted the Delphic oracle, they were told that they would ﬁnd relief
from their trouble if they captured and killed the murderers of Ikarios, and if they
founded a new festival, the Aiora (Feast of Swings), in honour of Erigone.177 In 
the course of this women’s festival, a song would be sung to Erigone under the title
of Aletis (the Wanderer, ostensibly because she had wandered in search of her father),
and girls would be swung from the branches of trees on swings with wooden boards.
It hardly needs saying that the rites would have preceded the aetiological tale;
swinging rituals of this kind were by no means peculiar to the Aiora.
— The younger Olympian gods and goddesses —
176

In a further story that was attached to this myth, the murderers of Ikarios were said to have
ﬂed to Keos, an island to the south-east of Attica. To punish the Keans for sheltering 
them, the dog Maira, who had been turned into the dog-star (Seirios, or Canicula in Latin)
after his death, scorched the land with his heat causing famine and disease. The island was
ruled at that time by Aristaios, son of Apollo (see p. 153), who had settled there after the
tragic death of his son Aktaion; and he sought the advice of his father’s oracle, which
instructed him to offer sacriﬁces to expiate for the death of Ikarios, and to pray to Zeus to
send cooling winds to moderate the heat of the dog-star. So he founded the cult of Zeus
Ikmaios (‘of moisture’) on Keos together with the annual rites that supposedly elicited the
Etesian winds, cooling northerly winds that blew in the Aegean for some forty days after
the rising of the dog-star.178
It was said that Zeus (or Dionysos) so pitied the fate of Ikarios, Erigone and the dog
Maira that he transferred them to the heavens as the constellations Bootes, Virgo and Canis
Major respectively179 (unless the dog became the dog-star).
Dionysos and the pirates; his journey to India, 
and wife and loves
One of the most charming myths of Dionysos is the story of his encounter with a
crew of pirates. As ﬁrst recounted in the Homeric Hymn (7) to Dionysos, it runs as
follows. Some Tyrrhenian pirates caught sight of the god when ‘he appeared by the
shore of the barren sea, in the likeness of a young man in the ﬁrst ﬂower of his
youth; beautiful were the dark locks of hair that waved about him, and on his sturdy

shoulders he wore a purple cloak’.180 Ignoring the warnings of their helmsman, who
recognized that he was no ordinary mortal, the pirates seized him and hauled him
on to their ship, imagining that he was a young man of royal birth who would
fetch a valuable ransom. They were not deterred even though the bonds fell off of
their own accord when they tried to tie him up. When they sailed out to sea with
him, strange miracles began to occur. First the ship streamed with wine and a divine
fragrance arose from it; and then a vine spread along the top of the sail, and an ivy-
plant twined around the mast, and garlands appeared on the rowlocks; and ﬁnally
and most fearsomely, the god turned himself into a lion and caused a towering bear
to appear. Overcome by terror when the lion seized the captain, the pirates jumped
overboard into the sea, where they were turned into dolphins. The helmsman alone
survived because he was held back by the god, who now revealed his identity to
him.181 Ovid, who recounts the same story with many variations of detail, names
the helmsman as a certain Acoetes (presumably Akoites in the origin Greek) from
Maeonia (Lydia), and reports that he became an enthusiastic member of the god’s
retinue thereafter.182

und Glyptothek, München.

The Homeric Hymn does not mention where the pirates found Dionysos or where they were
planning to take him; it is stated in subsequent accounts that he asked the sailors to take him
to the island of Naxos, but they intended to sell him in Asia instead.183 He is picked up on
Ikaria in Apollodorus’ account, or on Chios in that of Ovid. The miracles are generally elab-
orated in these later accounts. Apollodorus suggests, for instance, that Dionysos turned the
mast and the oars of the ship into snakes.184 The whole story is rather different in a version
from the astronomical literature. As Dionysos was being carried on the ship together with
some companions of his, he ordered them all to sing; the pirates were so enchanted by the
sound that they began to dance around, and ﬁnally leapt unwittingly into the sea, where they
were transformed into dolphins as usual; and the god commemorated the incident by placing
an image of one of the dolphins in the sky, hence the origin of the constellation of the 
Dolphin (Delphinus). This version would explain why dolphins are fond of music (a belief that
is also reﬂected in the legend of Arion and the dolphin, see p. 582).185
The god’s triumphs were not limited to a handful of pirates. According to a fairly
early body of myth (Euripides knew of it), he penetrated as a conqueror far into the
interior of Asia; after Alexander’s real conquests, Dionysos’ fabled ones were extended
and he was represented as having reached India. Here, however, the mythologist
need not follow him; for we are leaving the realm of genuine myth and saga for a
strange world in which pseudo-history and politics are blended together. On the
one hand it was obviously desirable, from the point of view of Alexander and his
successors, that they should be treading in the footsteps of a god, especially one
who was readily identiﬁed with all manner of oriental deities; on the other, Dionysos
was equated with Osiris, and Osiris Euhemerized into an early king of Egypt who
went about spreading culture, by force if necessary. So this Indian Dionysos, as we
ﬁnd him in the long and very dull Dionysian epic of Nonnus (ﬁfth century AD) for
example, is no Greek god but a hodge-podge of the mythology of several nations,
stirred together by Hellenistic princes and Hellenistic theories. The result does not
lack interest, but is outside our present scope.186
Dionysos’ conduct in the amorous sphere is rather exceptional for an Olympian
god; he took a mortal, Ariadne, as his consort (see p. 347) and had little or no
interest in passing dalliances. She was granted immortality in some accounts, as in
the Theogony, which reports that Zeus made her deathless and immortal on behalf
of Dionysos.187 The couple were credited with various children, notably Oinopion
(Wine-face), who ruled in Chios and was remembered for his encounter with Orion
(see p. 562), and Staphylos (Grape-bunch), who was the father of Rhoio and grand-
father of Anios, the seer-king of Delos (see p. 569).188
There are only a few minor tales that tell of other liaisons, and none that involve sexual
violence. Ampelos, who is mentioned by Ovid and Nonnus as having been loved by Dionysos,
is no more than a personiﬁcation of the vine (ampelos). As a token of his favour, Dionysos
presented him with a vine, which was trailed over an elm-tree; and when the youth fell to 
his death one day as he was culling some grapes from it, the god transferred him to the sky
as the star Vindemiator (the Vintager, in the constellation Virgo), whose early rising marked
the start of the grape-harvest. Or else Dionysos transformed him into a vine after he fell 
from a bull.189
Some said that Dionysos seduced Althaia with the tacit approval of her husband Oineus
(see p. 414), and so became the father of Deianeira, the second wife of Herakles (see

p. 279);190 according to Ovid he seduced Erigone when he introduced the vine to Attica
(see above), winning her favours by offering her a bunch of grapes;191 in the Hellespontine
tradition, Priapos was his son by Aphrodite (see p. 222); and Nonnus tells of his unrequited
love for the Amazon Nikaia.192 Women play a major part in his myths, of course, but gener-
ally in other roles, as his nurses and companions or as participants in his rites or opponents
of his cult.
In earlier artistic representations, until the second half of the ﬁfth century BC,
Dionysos is portrayed as a mature bearded man dressed in long robes. Vase-paintings
often show him wreathed in ivy or vine, and holding a cup (kantharos) or drinking-
horn in his hand. He may wear a panther-skin or deer-skin. From the latter part 
of the ﬁfth century onwards, he is usually portrayed as a youthful ﬁgure, without 
a beard, who is lightly dressed if at all. His special emblem, which may be carried 
by himself or by his attendants or worshippers, is the thyrsos, a staff that is tipped with
an ornament resembling a pine-cone, and often entwined with ivy or vine. His cultic
hymn is the dithyramb (dithyrambos, probably a word of foreign origin).
ATHENA
The wise virgin goddess ATHENA was a war-goddess, a protector of cities, and a
divine patroness of arts and crafts. The fuller form of her name, Athenaia or Athenaie,
was shortened to Athene in epic and to Athena in later Attic usage. She was scarcely
less important that Hera herself, and of greater importance in Athens where she was
worshipped as the city’s patron goddess. Although scholars have long disagreed as
to whether she gave her name to her favourite city or derived her name from it, the
latter alternative seems more probable. She appears on a Linear B tablet from Knossos
as Atana Potinija (i.e. the Mistress of Atana or Athana), and it has been argued that
she may have originated as a Mycenaean palace-goddess who protected the house-
holds and citadels of early kings. This would plausibly account for two main aspects
of her nature that might seem inconsistent at ﬁrst sight; her martial character and
her connection with peaceful handicrafts, notably weaving and spinning, that were
usually practised by women within the household. If she was once a divine protec-
tress of the fortress-palaces of Mycenaean princes, she would presumably have
assumed a martial aspect, and would thus have been well-ﬁtted to become the city-
goddess of later times, Athena Polias or Poliouchos (of the city, protector of the
city), the armed maiden who acted as a guardian of the city, often from her temple
on its fortress-hill. Her temple of the Parthenon on the Athenian Acropolis, which
had once been the site of a Mycenaean palace, is still the crowning monument of
Athens. In her other main aspect as a goddess of handicrafts (Athena Ergane), her
patronage was wide-ranging, even if her original concern may have been the domestic
crafts that were exercised in palace households. Her interests were by no means
conﬁned to women’s crafts, for she could also serve as a patroness to craftsmen 
such as carpenters, potters and jewellery-makers; in this connection, her cult at
Athens was closely linked with that of Hephaistos (see p. 165). From this begin-
ning, she developed increasingly into a goddess of wisdom in general, until late
— The younger Olympian gods and goddesses —
180

mythographers could consider her a personiﬁcation of Wisdom in the abstract. She
was represented as a moral and righteous deity of whom few, if any, unworthy tales
were told. At Rome, she was identiﬁed with the important Italian goddess Minerva,
who was a patroness of arts and crafts like herself.
The birth of Athena
Athena entered the world in most remarkable circumstances, as explained in 
Chapter 3; for her father Zeus swallowed her mother Metis while that goddess was
pregnant with her, and then brought her to birth from his own head (see p. 77).
According to the Homeric Hymn (28) to Athena, she sprang from his head in full
armour, presenting such a fearsome sight that the gods were seized with awe, and
Olympos reeled, and the earth cried out, and the sea tossed and foamed; the sun-
god Helios stayed his horses until she had removed the heavenly armour from her
shoulders, and Zeus was delighted with her, then as ever.193 Pindar refers likewise
to the awesome nature of her advent, stating that she leapt forth with a mighty 
cry, causing Ouranos and mother Gaia to tremble before her; and he adds a further
detail which appears more than a century earlier in the visual arts, namely that
Hephaistos eased her delivery by cleaving Zeus’s head with an axe. Although others
are sometimes named as having performed this service, whether Prometheus or
Hermes, or an obscure daimon called Palaimon, the divine blacksmith always
remains the favourite choice.194
A further development in the story of Athena’s birth was suggested by her ancient title of
Tritogeneia (which is of uncertain origin and meaning). This was often interpreted to imply
that she was born (egeneto) by one of the various rivers or other waters that bore the name
of Triton. According to the best-known story of the kind, she emerged from her father’s

head by the river Triton or Lake Tritonis in Libya (and was then reared there by Triton,
the god of the river or lake, see p. 106, in some accounts). Aeschylus remarks in the Eumenides
that the Libyan river saw her birth, and Euripides indicates the same of Lake Tritonis in
his Ion.195 Or according to local legends set in Greece itself, she was reared by the god of
the river Triton in Boeotia, or was born and reared at Aliphera in Arcadia after Zeus brought
her to birth by a spring there called the Tritonis.196 It is quite possible that her title of
Tritogeneia implies some connection with water, since the stem trito also appears in the
names of the sea-deities Amphitrite and Triton.
According to a Rhodian legend, the ﬁrst men to pay honour to the goddess after her birth
were the Heliadai, the sons of the sun-god Helios on Rhodes, who were advised by their
father that the people who ﬁrst offered sacriﬁce to her would enjoy her presence forever.
They acted in such haste, however, that they forgot to light a ﬁre beneath the sacriﬁcial
victims, hence (it was claimed) the distinctive Rhodian practice of offering ﬁreless sacriﬁces
to the goddess. She was apparently well pleased by their good intentions, for she granted
them skill in all manner of crafts, enabling them to make statues that were so lifelike that
they seemed to be alive. This must have been a fairly ancient myth since it is already
recounted by Pindar.197
Athena as a martial goddess and patroness of handicrafts; 
her title of Pallas
As might be expected in the case of so important and popular a goddess, a clear
idea of Athena’s personal appearance was formed at an early stage. She is represented
in art and literature as a stately virgin, with a beautiful but severe face, grey eyes,
and a powerful yet graceful build. She is normally shown fully armed with an elab-
orately crested helmet, wearing the aigis which serves her as a cuirass and cloak 
(see p. 74), and holding a long spear; the Gorgon’s head (see p. 242) may be set 
on her aigis or shield, and her special bird, the owl, may be seated on her shoulder. 
In representations of the battle between the gods and the Giants, she is always
prominent, and is shown striking down some of the most formidable of the enemy.
Her titles constantly bear witness to her warlike character; in various places she is
called Promachos (Champion), Sthenias (Mighty), Areia (Warlike, or companion of
Ares), and so forth. The other side of her character, as the peaceful protector of her
worshippers and their leader in all manner of skilled occupations, is brought out
likewise by a series of titles. She is Polias (Goddess of the City), Bouleia (She of the
Council), Ergane (Worker), Kourotrophos (Nurturer of Children, a title shared 
by several other goddesses). From Macedonia to Sparta, her importance was second
only to that of Zeus himself, whose favourite daughter she was; in Homer, he has
his special pet-name for her, ‘dear grey-eyes’,198 and pays special heed to her even
to the extent of arousing jealousy among the other gods.
Pallas was one of the commonest titles of Athena. This was seldom if ever a cult-
title, but rather a poetic appellation of the goddess; although it is always used in
conjunction with her proper name in the Homeric epics, which often refer to her
as Pallas Athenaie, it is also used on its own in the subsequent tradition, until it
virtually becomes an alternative name for the goddess. Its meaning and origin are
uncertain. According to the most favoured explanation, it means ‘Girl’ or ‘Maiden’
(cf. pallake¯, a concubine); but it was also suggested in antiquity that it was derived
— The younger Olympian gods and goddesses —
182

from pallein, to brandish, for Athena was often represented as brandishing a lance.199
A fragment from Philodemos (ﬁrst century BC) refers to a story that explained the
title by saying that she had once had a companion of that name, a daughter of
Palamaon, whom she had accidentally killed.200 Apollodorus recounts a similar 
story in which Athena was reared by Triton in the company of his daughter Pallas.
The two girls used to practise warlike exercises, but one day they quarrelled, and
as Pallas was about to strike Athena with the weapon that she was holding, Zeus
intervened on his daughter’s behalf by stretching out his aigis. As Pallas looked up
in surprise, Athena fatally wounded her, but was afterwards sorry for her playfellow’s
death, and therefore made an image of her which she clad in the aigis.201 This was
the famous Palladion (properly a cultic image of Athena herself), which fell to the
earth in the land of Troy and served as a protective talisman for the city (see 
p. 523). Another story stated that one of the Giants had been called Pallas and that
Athena had killed him during the war between the gods and the Giants, and had
ﬂayed him to use his skin as a shield.202
It is but natural that a war-goddess should be interested in the instruments of 
war, and we ﬁnd accordingly that Athena is credited with having invented the war-
chariot and the art of horse-taming. There is a very interesting myth that tells 
how she came to the assistance of the hero Bellerophon in the latter connection. 
His endeavours to catch and tame the immortal winged horse Pegasos had proved
unavailing, since no earthly bridle could control the beast. One night, however, as he
was sleeping in Athena’s shrine on the advice of a seer, the goddess appeared to him
and placed a celestial bridle in his hand, telling him that he should use it to tame 
his divine mount. He awoke to ﬁnd that the wondrous bridle was actually lying 
at his side, and he put it to good effect (see further on p. 434).203 Warships were also
of interest to Athena (which may well be the reason why the sports at her great festival
of the Panathenaia included a regatta, which is unusual in ancient games), and we
shall see that she supervised the building of the Argo, the mythical precursor of the
ﬁfty-oared ships (pentekonters) that were used as war-galleys in historical times. On
the borderline between her peaceful and her warlike occupations we may place her
connection with music. She was actually worshipped under the title of Salpinx
(Trumpet) at Argos,204 and the ﬂute (aulos, Latin tibia; really more like the oboe than
the ﬂute of today) was her invention. According to Pindar, she was inspired to invent
the ﬂute and its distinctive music on hearing the wild lamentations that were poured
forth by the two surviving Gorgons after the death of their sister Medusa.205 Later
sources report that she came to dislike her invention because it distorted her face
unbecomingly when she played on it, and that she therefore discarded her ﬂutes (they
were generally played in pairs).206 Marsyas the Satyr picked them up, to her great
annoyance and ultimately to his own detriment (see further on p. 157).
As patroness of peaceful handicrafts, Athena presided over arts and crafts practised
by men and women alike, but especially over the distinctively feminine accomplish-
ments of spinning and weaving, which were usually exercised in the home by the
housewife with the aid of her daughters and servant-women. Homer refers to 
the goddess’s concern for these ‘works of Athena’,207 and mentions her as having
fashioned richly embroidered robes for herself and Hera.208 She was extensively
worshipped in this connection, and is occasionally shown with a spindle in artistic

images, even if such representations are far less common than those that show her
in martial guise. At the festival of the Panathenaia at Athens, she would be presented
with a robe (peplos) that was woven by the women of the city to clothe her great
statue in the Parthenon.
A memorable if not particularly early myth is recorded for Athena in connection with her
interests as a weaver; for it was said that she once came into conﬂict with a mortal craftswoman,
ARACHNE, and treated her most unfairly if Ovid is to be believed. This Arachne was 
the most skilful weaver in Lydia, and boasted that she could even outdo Athena herself. The
goddess appeared to her in the form of an old woman and warned her against presumption;
but when Arachne refused to hear reason, she threw off her disguise and agreed to accept the
challenge that the girl had offered. Athena wove into her web the story of her contest with
Poseidon for Athens, and, as due warning to Arachne, the stories of various mortals who had
aroused the wrath of the gods and been signally punished. Arachne chose for her subject-
matter a collection of scandalous tales of the loves of the gods. Although Arachne’s tapestry
was ﬂawlessly executed, her choice of subject proved too much for Athena’s temper, which was
never of the mildest, and she tore the offending fabric to pieces and beat Arachne with 
her shuttle. In her distress at this treatment, Arachne tried to hang herself, but Athena 
saved her and turned her into a spider; she continues to weave most skilfully in her new form, 
and has incidentally provided modern zoologists with a name for the spider-kind.209
Athena and her Athenian foster-son Erichthonios
It is only to be expected that special legends should have been developed to account
for Athena’s close relationship with Athens. According to a familiar tale which has
already been recounted (see p. 102), she initially established herself as the patron
goddess of Attica by defeating Poseidon in a contest for the land. As we saw above,
this particular legend follows a fairly common pattern, for Poseidon was said to have
met with failure (or limited success) in contests for a variety of lands, including
Argos, where he was defeated by Hera. The Athenians had a further legend, however,
of a wholly distinctive nature, which told how Athena established an even closer
connection with Athens by becoming the ‘mother’ (so far as this was possible for a
virgin goddess) of Erichthonios, the autochthonous ancestor of the Athenian people.
Although the remarkable myth of his conception is recorded in differing forms, the
basic story is always the same: Hephaistos tried to make love to Athena, but she
repelled him in such circumstances that he emitted some semen on to the ground,
causing it to become fertilized. Even if she could not be the mother of the child,
she was thus involved in his conception; and she claimed him as her own by adopting
and rearing him after he was brought to birth.
In one account, Hephaistos fell in love with Athena and tried to court her, but
she sought to escape him by hiding in Attica at a place called Hephaistion, which
supposedly owed its name to this incident; and when he caught and embraced her
in a state of high excitement, she thrust him away with her spear, causing him to
ejaculate on to the ground.210 Or when Hephaistos returned to Olympos after being
hurled down to the earth by his mother, Zeus allowed him the choice of whatever
he most desired, and he asked to marry Athena; but Athena had no intention of
allowing any such thing, and defended her virginity by force when he came to claim
— The younger Olympian gods and goddesses —
184

her, with the same consequences as above.211 Or in yet another version, Hephaistos
once chased after her with amorous intent when she visited him to acquire some
weaponry, for he was feeling frustrated after he had been abandoned by Aphrodite.
She resisted him with such vigour, however, that he ejaculated over her leg; 
and she wiped the semen away in disgust with a piece of wool and hurled it to 
the ground.212
The latter detail was inserted to provide an explanation for the name of Erichthonios, who
could therefore be said to have been born from the ground, chtho¯n, because it had been
fertilized through contact with the piece of wool, erion. Even without the beneﬁt of this
reﬁnement, it could be explained that the child was called Erichthonios because he had been
born from the ground as a result of the struggle, eris, between Hephaistos and Athena.213
When the time came for Gaia to bring the child to birth, she rose up from the
ground to hand him to Athena, who thus became his adoptive mother. Although
Athena initially placed him in a chest and entrusted it to the daughters of Kekrops,
king of Athens, this proved to be a short-lived experiment for reasons that will be
considered later (see p. 365), and she soon received him back again. From then
onwards she reared him herself on the Acropolis; and when he grew up, he won the

throne of Athens and established the royal line from which the subsequent kings
would be descended. He honoured his divine foster-mother by founding her greatest
Athenian festival, the Panathenaia (see further on p. 368), and he was buried in her
precinct after his death.214
This is a most intriguing and ingenious story. The Athenians prided themselves
on their autochthony, and Erichthonios is pictured accordingly as earthborn, after
the manner of his predecessor Kekrops (and two other primordial rulers in the
Hellenistic king-lists, see p. 367). On the other hand, he is no ordinary earthborn
‘ﬁrst man’ like Kekrops, Pelasgos (see p. 537) and others of their kind who sprang
up from the ground without need for a father; for he is conceived to Hephaistos, a
god who was worshipped at Athens along with Athena as a patron of handicrafts,
and he is brought into a quasi-ﬁlial relationship with the virgin goddess herself.
Athena was usually benevolent in her dealings with mortals. She would offer technical assis-
tance in enterprises such as the construction of the Argo or the Wooden Horse, and was
always ready to offer support and advice to favoured heroes such as Perseus and Herakles.
She supported the Greeks in the Trojan War, as might be expected after her defeat in the
judgement of Paris, and plays a prominent role in the Odyssey, providing invaluable assis-
tance to Odysseus and his son Telemachos. In her one notable revenge-story from the early
tradition, she sent a violent storm against the Greek ﬂeet after the Trojan War to avenge
an act of sacrilege committed during the sack of Troy (see p. 481). In one account of the
blinding of Teiresias, Athena caused his blindness because he saw her naked; but she compen-
sated him at his mother’s request by granting him the gift of prophecy (see p. 330).
ARTEMIS AND HER COUSIN HEKATE
Artemis the virgin huntress
We must now pass on to another virgin goddess, ARTEMIS, whose essential char-
acteristics are immediately evident in the conventional portrayal of her in works of
art, which commonly represent her as a young, tall and vigorous maiden who wears
a short tunic reaching to her knees, carries a bow and quiver, and is often accom-
panied by a stag or doe. In all accounts, she is a virgin who devotes herself to
hunting, and loves wild, untamed lands and their wildlife (hence her title of
Agrotera, ‘She of the Wild’, an epithet already applied to her in Homer215). Her
favourite hunting-ground is Arcadia, the mountainous heartland of the Peloponnese,
and she likes nothing better than to roam through the wilds in the company of her
attendant nymphs, who are vowed to virginity like herself. The Homeric Hymn to
Aphrodite remarks that she never falls under the sway of the goddess of love, ‘for
archery is her delight, and the slaying of wild beasts in the mountains, and lyres
too, and dancing, and piercing cries and shady woods, and’ – the poet adds – ‘the
cities of just men’.216 The Odyssey speaks of her in similar terms, telling how Artemis
the archer roams over the mountains of Arcadia, rejoicing in the pursuit of boars
and swift deer in the company of her nymphs.217 A gentler side of her nature is
shown in her concern for the young of all living things, whether of wild beasts, as
an aspect of her nature as the protectress of wild animals, or of human beings.
— The younger Olympian gods and goddesses —
186

According to a chorus from Aeschylus, she is kind to the helpless cubs of ravening
lions and delights in the tender sucklings of all beasts that wander the wild.218
Hence her role as a goddess of childbirth who is appealed to by women in labour,
and her titles of Locheia (she of the childbed) and Kourotrophos (nurse of the young).
She is also a goddess who presides over the initiation of young girls. Although
kindly on occasion, she is a formidable goddess who acts as an agent of death, espe-
cially with regard to women, and is ruthless in avenging any slight. This side of
her nature is much to the fore in her mythical tales, which frequently show her
inﬂicting death and disaster on mortals.
As is understandable for a goddess who was connected with the life of women, Artemis came
to be associated (or indeed equated) with the moon, to an even greater extent than Hera.
The Stoic allegorists in particular liked to identify her with the moon; if she is presented
as ﬁghting against Hera in the battle of the gods in the Iliad, for example, it is because the
moon cuts through the air (ae¯r, as symbolized by Hera) in its circuits, an idea that is
conﬁrmed by the name of Artemis – if it can be interpreted as meaning ae¯ro-temis or air-
cutter!219 Plutarch suggests at one point that Artemis is associated with childbirth by virtue
of her nature as a moon-goddess.220 This is a comparatively late development, however;
neither the earliest references to Artemis in literature nor the earliest forms of her cult hint
in any way that she was a lunar goddess.
Artemis also came to be identiﬁed with the infernal goddess Hekate (see p. 193). The
Hesiodic Catalogue already seems to connect the two goddesses by stating that Iphigeneia was
transformed into Artemis Einodia (a regular title of Hekate) after she was rescued from sacri-
ﬁce by Artemis (see p. 513).221 The identiﬁcation is certainly quite early if Aeschylus has it
in mind when he refers to Artemis Hekate222 (but it is possible that this is no more than an
epithet meaning ‘far-darting’, corresponding to Apollo’s epithet of Hekatos).
Artemis’ connection with wild animals connects her, not with any Greek goddess,
but with the old deity who is often called the Mistress of Wild Animals (a title
suggested by the Homeric phrase potnia the¯ro¯n, as applied to Artemis in the Iliad223),
a great goddess of very ancient origin who was honoured under various names by the
people of Minoan Crete, prehellenic Greece and Asia Minor. As we will see, Artemis
was equated with two Cretan goddesses of that type, Britomartis and Diktynna. The
etymology of her name is too uncertain to provide any evidence on her origin; it seems
to appear in Linear B, although this is not entirely certain. We can be sure, however,
that she was originally independent of Apollo and Leto. If she originated as a Mistress
of the Animals, it must be acknowledged that she has undergone a considerable
change, since the Aegean and Eastern goddesses of that type were mature mother-
goddesses while Artemis is young and virginal (except in her cult at Ephesus, where
she was represented as a many-breasted fertility-goddess).
The main features of the classical Artemis are already in evidence in the Homeric
epics. Even if she was pictured as brave and skilful in the hunting-ﬁeld and
frequently ﬁerce in her character, she was never regarded as a martial goddess; 
and although she is described in the Iliad as a supporter of the Trojans, she makes
no appearance in the battle-scenes. On the one occasion in which she engages in
hostilities of a kind, in the so-called battle of the gods in the twenty-ﬁrst book, 
her contribution is none too impressive, for when she ventures to oppose Hera, the

senior goddess beats her around the ears with her own bow and quiver, causing 
her to run off to her father Zeus in a ﬂood of tears.224 It would naturally be wrong
to conclude too much about her contemporary status from a burlesque of this kind.
Although she is clearly out of place in the military world of the Iliad, Homer
portrays her in her preferred environment in a passage in the Odyssey, in which he
illustrates the standing of Nausikaa among her handmaidens by comparing it to
that of Artemis among her attendant nymphs:
Even as Artemis the archer roams over the mountains, along the ridges of lofty
Taygetos or Erymanthos, taking delight in the pursuit of wild beasts and swift-
running deer, and the nymphs of the countryside, daughters of aigis-bearing
Zeus, join in the sport, and Leto is glad of heart, while Artemis rises head
and shoulders above them all and may be recognized with ease though all are
beautiful – so did the unmarried maiden [i.e. the princess Nausikaa, see 
p. 498] stand out among her attendants’.225
She was evidently regarded as being of some signiﬁcance in her own sphere in
Homer’s time since she is mentioned quite often in both epics as a goddess of wild
things and killer of women, and for the part that she played in legends such as the
hunt for the Calydonian boar. Homer places a particular emphasis on her function
as an agent of death. She sometimes acts on behalf of another god or of the gods
in general, as when she is said to have killed Ariadne because of witness that was
brought against her by Dionysos (see p. 348), or Orion because the gods disap-
proved of his love affair with the goddess Eos (see p. 561).226 Or in a more general
sense, any sudden or unaccountable death of a woman could be attributed to the
arrows of Artemis; when Odysseus meets his mother in the Underworld, he asks
her accordingly whether she had died from a long illness or whether Artemis had
killed her with her kindly arrow (for death can be a merciful release); and a woman
who dies by falling into the hold of a ship is said to have fallen victim to the archer
Artemis.227 Homer is less concerned with killings in which the goddess acts to
avenge personal grievances, although he does mention that she killed Laodameia,
daughter of Bellerophon, in anger.228
How Leto came to give birth to Artemis and Apollo on Delos
In considering the legends of Artemis, we must return to the beginning to examine
the circumstances in which she and her brother Apollo were born. According to the
earliest full account in the Homeric Hymn to Apollo, LETO (a daughter of the Titans
Koios and Phoibe, see p. 37) conceived the divine twins to Zeus but had difﬁculty
in ﬁnding a place to give birth when her pregnancy reached its full term; for
although she visited any number of lands, from Crete and Athens to Lemnos and
Naxos, all turned her away for fear of becoming the birthplace of her son Apollo,
who might be expected to be a formidable god who would lord it over gods and
mortals alike. In the end, however, she persuaded the island of Delos to accept her
by promising that Apollo would establish his main sanctuary there, and that he
would honour Delos above all other places.229 All the foremost goddesses came to
attend the birth, with the exception of Hera who remained on Olympos, keeping
— The younger Olympian gods and goddesses —
188

Eileithuia, the goddess of childbirth, with her. As a consequence, Leto suffered the
pains of travail for nine days and nights without relief, until the other goddesses
sent the divine messenger Iris to summon Eileithuia. Encouraged by the promise
of a splendid necklace strung with golden threads, Eileithuia soon arrived on the
scene, and Leto was at last able to give birth to her children. She gave birth to
Apollo on Delos, clasping a palm-tree as she did so, and to Artemis on Ortygia,
presumably as her second-born.230 Ortygia seems to have been a separate place at
this stage, although it was usually identiﬁed with Delos itself in the later tradition.
In subsequent accounts, Leto’s difﬁculties in ﬁnding a place for the birth are
explained by the hostility of Hera, which seems more natural and makes a better
story. According to Callimachus, Hera sent her son Ares and the goddess Iris (who
often acts as a special envoy of Hera in later literature) to warn every place in the
Greek world not to receive her husband’s mistress; but poor rocky Delos, then 
called Asterie, dared to resist the goddess’s threats and invited Leto to come and give
birth there.231 Or in Apollodorus’ version, Leto was chased all over the earth by 
Hera until she arrived at Delos, where she gave birth to her twin children, beginning
with Artemis, who immediately helped with the delivery of Apollo.232 The latter
detail was suggested, of course, by Artemis’ function as a goddess who brought help
to women in childbirth. This account of the order of the two births is consistent with
the tradition on Delos, where the birthday of Artemis was celebrated a day before that
of her brother. Hyginus offers yet another version, in which Hera decreed that Leto
should not give birth in any place that was lit by the light of the sun. The pregnant
Leto was pursued, furthermore, by the Delphian dragon Python, who knew by his
own prophetic powers that she would give birth to a son who would kill him; but
Zeus came to the aid of his mistress by ordering Boreas (the North Wind) to carry
her off to Poseidon; and to enable her to give birth without contravening Hera’s
decree, Poseidon took her to Delos and covered it over with waves for a period to cut
it off from the light of the sun. Four days after his birth, so the story tells, Apollo
avenged Python’s treatment of his mother by travelling to Central Greece to shoot
him dead with one of his arrows (see p. 145).233
Leto’s sister ASTERIE was sometimes drawn into the legend of the birth of Apollo and
Artemis. The ﬁrst traces of her story appear in an imperfectly preserved poem by Pindar,
which states that Asterie was once pursued by Zeus but tried to escape him and dropped into
the sea to become the island of Ortygia. Later sources conﬁrm what these remains would
suggest, namely that Zeus set out to seduce Asterie after rendering her sister pregnant, but
she sought to escape him and ﬁnally turned into the island of Asterie or Ortygia, later known
as Delos, on which her sister gave birth to the divine twins soon afterwards. Some sources add
that she transformed herself (or less satisfactorily, was transformed by Zeus) into a quail – ortyx
– in the course of her ﬂight, hence the name of Ortygia (Quail Island).234
According to a picturesque tale of Hellenistic origin, Leto took her children to Lycia in
the south-western corner of Asia Minor after giving birth to them on Delos, and tried to
wash them in a local spring called Melita; but she was chased away by some herdsmen 
who wanted to water their cattle there. A band of wolves (lykoi) came to her aid, however,
by showing her the way to the river Xanthos; and after quenching her thirst and bathing 
her children in the river, she dedicated it to Apollo and named the land Lycia (Wolf-land)
in honour of her guides. She then retraced her steps to punish the uncharitable herdsmen.

On ﬁnding that they were still by the spring, she transformed them into frogs and cast
them into its waters, hence the semi-aquatic life that frogs have lived ever since.235 Or in
Ovid’s version, some malicious peasants obstructed Leto and muddied the waters when she
tried to quench her thirst at a pool in Lycia, and she punish them immediately by turning
them into frogs.236 Apollo has Lycian connections as we have seen (p. 143), and Leto herself
seems to have originated in Asia Minor.
According to Delian legend, two maidens called Hyperoche and Laodike arrived from
the land of the Hyperboreans (a mythical people of the remote north, see p. 148) soon
after the birth of Artemis and Apollo, bringing thank-offerings that their people had
vowed to the goddess of childbirth to ensure Leto of an easy delivery. They died on
Delos and were buried near the temple of Artemis, where their supposed tomb could
be seen in historical times; the young people of the island would cut off a lock of their
hair and lay it on the tomb before their marriage. These were not the only
Hyperboreans who were said to have been buried on the island, for two other
maidens, Arge and Opis (or Oupis) were said to have arrived from the north some-
what earlier, at the time of the birth of the twins, and to have been buried behind
the temple of Artemis. The ashes from the thigh-bones of animals that were burnt
on the altar of Artemis would be scattered on their joint tomb.237
The extreme holiness of Delos made it no place for a burial in ordinary circumstances.
Excavations have revealed that the cults of both pairs of maidens were centred on Bronze
Age tombs, whose original signiﬁcance would have been long forgotten by the time when
the cults were developed. The name of Opis was derived from a cultic title of Artemis
herself. In one account of the death of Orion, Artemis shot him for trying to rape Opis (see
p. 563). Callimachus diverges from Herodotus by stating that the ﬁrst Hyperborean offer-
ings went brought by Oupis along with two companions, Loxo and Hekaerge238 (cf. Loxias
as a title of Apollo, and Hekaergos and Hekaerge as titles of Apollo and Artemis respec-
tively). Hekaerge may have been an alternative name for Arge. When Delphi was attacked
by the Gauls in 279 BC, two ghostly Hyperboreans, Hyperochos and Laodokos (whose names
were evidently based of those of the ﬁrst pair of Hyperborean maidens mentioned above)
were supposed to have fought in its defence.239
There was a curious tale in which the pregnant Leto was said to have turned herself into
a wolf to escape the persecutions of Hera, and to have travelled in that form from the land
of the Hyperboreans to Delos; ever since that time, so the story would have us believe,
wolves have given birth to their young only on the twelve days of the year that correspond
to those on which the goddess made her long journey.240
Early deeds of Artemis; the goddess and her attendants
If Artemis assisted her brother in some of his earlier exploits, as was often claimed,
her adventures began soon after her birth; it was sometimes said that she helped
Apollo to shoot Python,241 the Delphian dragon (see p. 145), and it was often said
that she helped in the killing of Tityos, or indeed killed him on her own (see p.
148). She later joined together with her brother to kill all the Niobids (see p. 157),
and shot Koronis, an unfaithful mistress of Apollo, on her brother’s behalf (see p.
149). Although she usually had nothing to do with war, she played her part in the
battle between the gods and the Giants, making good use of her bow (see p. 90).

Some of the most distinctive myths of the virgin goddess tell of her actions with
regard to nymphs or maidens who accompanied her on the hunt. By becoming her
companions and attendants, they bound themselves to the same way of life as their
divine mistress, and she was merciless towards those who lost their virginity or
ceased to join her on the hunting-ﬁeld. The most famous of her erring associates 
(if that is proper term for a victim of rape) was the Arcadian heroine KALLISTO,
who was likewise an ancient ﬁgure, and may well have originated as a by-form of
the goddess herself (who had a cult in Arcadia, and in Athens too, as Artemis
Kalliste, ‘the most beautiful’). Kallisto was raped by Zeus and became pregnant
with a son, Arkas, who was destined to give his name to Arcadia (see p. 540). Some
months afterwards, when Artemis ordered her companions to undress to bathe 
with her in the midday heat, she noticed that Kallisto was pregnant and drove her
away in a fury, and even transformed her into a bear by way of punishment in 
some accounts.242 The myth is preserved in many different versions; see pp. 541–2
for a more detailed discussion. According to another tale of the kind, a certain
MAIRA, daughter of Proitos, was shot by Artemis for ceasing to attend the hunt
after she was seduced by Zeus. She was evidently not killed immediately since she
survived to give birth to her child, a son Lokros who helped Zethos and Amphion
in the building of Thebes. Such is her story as imperfectly transmitted in a brief
summary of an account by Pherecydes; it may have been very ancient since Homer
includes a Maira among the famous women who were seen by Odysseus in the
Underworld.243
In one account of the myth of HIPPE, daughter of Cheiron, she was transformed
into a horse by Artemis because she had ceased to honour the goddess and to accom-
pany her on the hunt;244 but there were many versions of her story, and it was 
more commonly said that she prayed to the gods to transform her to prevent her
father from discovering that she was about to give birth to a child (see further on
p. 409). Euripides makes a passing reference to a story in which Artemis drove an
unnamed daughter of Merops from her company ‘on account of her beauty’, and
turned her into a hind with horns of gold (perhaps the Cerynitian hind, see p. 259);
she was presumably another companion who was raped or seduced on account of
her beauty.245
BRITOMARTIS was a faithful Cretan companion of Artemis who attracted the
lust of Minos. We have Solinus’ word for it that her name is Cretan and meant
‘sweet maid’; and she was properly a goddess, a Cretan deity who came to be iden-
tiﬁed with Artemis herself. In the earliest surviving account by Callimachus, her
myth runs as follows. Minos, king of Crete, conceived a desperate passion for her,
and pursued her over the hills of the island for nine months as she tried to hide
from him as best she could, now under lofty oaks, now in the water-meadows; 
but ﬁnally, when she was all but caught, she was obliged to leap over a cliff into
the sea. She survived unharmed, however, because she fell into the nets (diktya) of
some ﬁshermen; and she was therefore known from that time onwards as Diktynna
(the Lady of the Nets).246 This was the name of a Cretan goddess who was very like
Britomartis, and was fully identiﬁed with her outside Crete itself; by means of a
false etymology, this myth explains Diktynna’s name (which was probably derived
from that of Mt Dikte in Crete) as a title of Britomartis. To explain why myrtle

was never used in connection with the cult of Britomartis/Diktynna, it was added
that a myrtle branch had become entangled in Britomartis’ clothing during her
ﬂight, and that she had therefore hated the plant ever since.247
A supplement to Britomartis’ usual tale is provided in an anthology of Hellenistic
transformation myths. To escape from Minos, she sought refuge with some ﬁsh-
ermen who hid her in their nets; and she then sailed across to Aegina with a
ﬁsherman called Andromedes. At the end of the voyage, this ﬁsherman added to
her travails by trying to rape her, but she managed to escape by jumping overboard 
and hiding in a wood on the island. She then vanished without trace; and since a
statue appeared in place of her in the sanctuary of Artemis, the Aiginetans founded
a cult to her at the place where she had become invisible (aphane¯s), under the name
of Apheia.248 It is difﬁcult to tell when this ancient but obscure goddess ﬁrst 
came to be identiﬁed with Britomartis/Diktynna; it is quite possible that the
identiﬁcation was relatively late, perhaps originating in the learned poetry of the
Hellenistic era.
Tales of vengeance
If Artemis was harsh toward erring companions, she naturally showed no pity to
those who offended against her own person. In one account at least, she killed her
only male hunting-companion, Orion, because he tried to court or rape her (see 
pp. 563–4). She was often said to have contrived the death of the Aloadai for a
similar reason (see p. 92), and she shot Bouphagos (Ox-eater), an obscure hero of
her favourite land of Arcadia, when he tried to rape her.249 When Aktaion happened 
to catch sight of her as she was bathing in a spring, she contrived a gruesome 
death for him by transforming him into a stag and causing him to be hunted down
by his own hounds (see p. 298); but in a lesser-known story, she was comparatively
lenient towards a certain Siproites who saw her naked in Crete, for she merely turned
him into a woman.250 According to a tale of a rather different kind, a cultic legend
associated with the shrine of Alpheian Artemis at Letrinoi in Elis, the Peloponnesian
river-god Alpheios (who was of an amorous disposition, see p. 42) once planned to
rape her at Letrinoi while she was celebrating a night festival with her nymphs, but
she caught wind of his intent and covered her own face and the faces of her compan-
ions with mud, so making it impossible for him to pick her out.251
Artemis also took appropriate action if she were denied her proper honours in 
cult or slighted in any respect. She sent a huge boar to ravage the lands of Oineus,
king of Calydon, to punish him for forgetting her while he was offering sacriﬁces to
all the gods (see p. 416); and she ﬁlled the marriage-chamber of Admetos with coils
of snakes as an omen of early death to avenge a similar offence (see p. 151). Or in a
less familiar legend, she shot a Phocian heroine, Chione, daughter of Daidalion, for
criticizing her during a hunt or for claiming to be more beautiful than her.252
The most interesting of these revenge myths is that in which Artemis demanded the
sacriﬁce of Iphigeneia to punish an offence committed by her father Agamemnon. 
In many accounts, including the oldest of all, Iphigeneia turns out to be far from a
victim, for she is often said to have been rescued by the goddess at the last moment
and brought into close association with her; see further on pp. 447 and 513.

The Romans identiﬁed Artemis with the Italian woodland goddess Diana, who
was not unlike her in many respects. The Italian goddess had no native statues of
course, so in art the familiar ﬁgure of the huntress Artemis (Diane chasseresse) was
used for both alike. As has been mentioned, the goddess is typically portrayed as a
young and beautiful woman, with her chiton girt up to the knee, generally armed
with a bow and quiver, and regularly accompanied by a stag or other beast. She is
also shown in long robes, however. In so far as she came to be identiﬁed with the
moon, her head may be surmounted by a crescent. Her emblems, besides attendant
beasts and weapons, include the torch, which is a common attribute of goddesses
of fertility because light is very commonly associated with life and birth. This is a
point in which she resembled the goddess Hekate, who also aided women in child-
birth and carried torches as a regular attribute.
Hekate as a high goddess and as queen of the ghosts
HEKATE is a cousin of Artemis in the standard Hesiodic genealogy, as the daughter
of Leto’s sister Asterie;253 and the two goddesses, though certainly of separate origin,
were quite frequently identiﬁed, probably from the classical period or even earlier.
As commonly pictured in classical and later times, however, Hekate was very
different from Artemis in most respects, as a grim and fantastic goddess who was
queen of the ghosts, and therefore of all magic, the blacker the better.
To judge by the spread of related place-names and other evidence, Hekate origin-
ated in Caria in the south-western corner of Asia Minor, where she would have been
worshipped as a principal goddess; but she was introduced to Greece quite early,
certainly by the seventh century BC, as a goddess who was honoured in private cult.
Although Homer makes no mention of her (as is understandable in view of the
private nature of her worship), Hesiod praises her at some length and with evident
personal enthusiasm, as a universal goddess. He declares that she bestows all manner
of gifts on worshippers who enjoy her favour, such as wealth, success at the 
games, skill in horsemanship, victory in war, and good counsel; and he states that
Zeus granted her exceptional privileges in spite of her Titan birth, both in heaven
and on earth and at sea. The only realm to be left out of account is the Under-
world, the very realm that is most closely associated with her in the later tradition.
Precisely because the poet makes her the special focus of his religious ardour, 
his ‘hymn to Hekate’, as it has been called, throws little light on the individual
character of the goddess.254 Although we have no deﬁnite evidence on the subject,
she was presumably worshipped in her original homeland as a great goddess who
was not primarily concerned with the uncanny and magical. If she had no concern
at all for such matters, however, it is hard to understand why she should have devel-
oped into the goddess who is familiar to us from classical and later accounts in
Greece. The Homeric Hymn to Demeter (probably late seventh century BC) links her
to Persephone in a way that suggests that she already had Underworld connections
at the time of its composition. For the poem recounts that she heard Persephone
cry out as she was being abducted by Hades and told Demeter of this, and that
when Persephone later returned to visit her mother, Hekate embraced her and
became her attendant and companion from that time onward.255 It is clear from

references in tragedy that Hekate was associated with spooks and the pathways of
the night by the classical period at any rate.256
In her capacity as queen of ghosts, Hekate was also the goddess of pathways
(Enodios) and of cross-roads (hence her title of Trioditios, ‘she of the three ways’), 
for crossroads were regarded as great centres of ghostly and magical activity as in
modern folklore. It is apparently for that reason that Hekate’s statues often represent
her in triple form, so that she may look simultaneously down all the roads 
that meet at the point where she is standing. She would send spooks up into the world
at night, or would appear in her own right, especially at crossroads under the dim
light of the moon, to roam the pathways at the head of a crew of ghosts. Her retinue,
the host of Hekate, was made up of shades of the restless dead who had died
prematurely or violently, or had received no proper burial. Since she would also be
accompanied by loud-barking daimonic dogs, her passage bears a resemblance to the
‘Wild Hunt’ of Western European folklore. The goddess and her night-wandering
companions might inﬂict madness or epilepsy on mortals who encountered them, and
was certainly a source of night-terrors and bad dreams. To propitiate Hekate and 
her host, and so keep them at a safe distance, the Greeks would leave offerings for
them at crossroads at the turn of the month; known as ‘Hekate’s suppers’ (deipna
Hekate¯s; or simply Hekateia), these consisted of cakes, eggs, cheeses and the like.257
Dogs were also sacriﬁced to Hekate, and the remains of puriﬁcatory sacriﬁces might
be offered to the goddess and her crew with averted gaze. Magicians and sorcerers, on
the other hand, would summon her aid for their own nefarious purposes, or even try
to summon her up in person. The sorceress Medeia invokes her as her mistress and
helper in Euripides’ Medeia; and in Theocritus’ second Idyll, a young woman is shown
as praying for her help in some love-magic:
Shine brightly for me, o Moon, for it is to you that I shall chant, silent goddess,
and to infernal Hekate, who causes the very dogs to tremble before her 
as she passes over the graves of the dead and the dark blood. Hail grim 
Hekate, and remain with me to the end, so that these drugs of my making
may prove as powerful as any of Kirke’s, or of Medeia’s, or of golden-haired
Perimede’s.258
On curse-tablets (deﬁxiones) likewise, the writer often calls on Hekate to put a curse
into action.
APHRODITE
The goddess of love
The one great goddess who remains to be considered is APHRODITE, who presided
over sexual attraction and the pleasures of love (ta Aphrodisia) and all that is asso-
ciated with them. In the standard account of her birth, as recounted by Hesiod, she
grew from the foam (aphros) that gathered around the severed genitals of Ouranos
(Sky) after they were thrown into the sea by his son Kronos (see p. 67). This would
mean that she was born at an earlier stage than any other Olympian god. Homer
— The younger Olympian gods and goddesses —
194

offers a different account, however, which may well be of earlier origin, describing
her as the daughter of Zeus and Dione (see p. 80), and thus as an Olympian god
of the second generation like Apollo and Artemis.259 As to her historical origin, it
may be safely said that she owed a great deal, and probably almost all, to oriental
inﬂuences. From the Iliad onwards, she is often called Kypris, ‘Lady of Cyprus’,
where her cult was certainly very old and as certainly of non-Greek origin;260 and
she also had an ancient association with Cythera off the south-eastern corner of the
Peloponnese, as is acknowledged by Hesiod, who states that she drifted past the
island after her birth, hence her title of Kytheria, before stepping ashore on Cyprus
which was destined to be her main home. Her shrine on Cythera, which contained
an armed wooden idol of the goddess, was thought to be the earliest in Greece;
Herodotus regarded it as being of Phoenician foundation.261 It is in fact more than
likely that she was a goddess of Semitic origin, as an adaptation of the great Semitic
love-goddess who was known to the Phoenicians as Astarte and to the Babylonians
as Ishtar. Aphrodite’s title of Ourania, the Heavenly, corresponds to Astarte’s as
Queen of Heaven, and various aspects of her cult, such as the use of incense-altars
and dove-sacriﬁces, and the occasional practice of temple-prostitution as at Corinth,
can be related to cultic practices associated with Astarte/Ishtar.
Aphrodite was the goddess of love, beauty and fertility, and also of married love
to some extent, although Hera tended to dominate in that area. She had marine
associations as a goddess who was naturally associated with water and moisture, and
was said to have risen up from the sea in the usual myth of her birth (hence her
title of Anadyomene, ‘she who rises up from the sea’); she was often shown with a
shell as her attribute, or with a dolphin, and was widely honoured as a protector of
sailors who could bring calm to the sea or victory in sea-battles. She had various
titles in this connection, such as Pontia, Thalassia and Einalia (all meaning ‘of the
sea’) or Euploia (as a goddess who can ensure ‘a good voyage’). Her martial aspect,
which may seem more surprising, can be explained by a similar trait in her Semitic
equivalent; she was worshipped as an armed war-goddess at Cythera and Sparta espe-
cially, and as Nikephoros, the Bringer of Victory, at Argos. This is no doubt the
real reason why she was commonly united with Ares, who was her cult-partner here
and there, and her lover or husband in mythology (see p. 201). It was doubtless
because of her connection with fertility that she was often associated with Hermes
in cult. Although the Greeks followed Hesiod in relating her name to the aphros,
sea-foam, from which she had supposedly sprung, its true origin and meaning are
wholly uncertain; no Indo-European etymology has been proposed that is at all
convincing.
Plato and Xenophon draw a sharp distinction between Aphrodite Ourania on the one hand,
as the ‘heavenly’ goddess who presides over the highest form of love that is directed primarily
towards the soul of the beloved, and Aphrodite Pandemos (of all the people) on the other 
hand, as the goddess who concerns herself with vulgar or mercenary love that is purely carnal
in nature.262 This is a literary conceit of a moralistic character that deliberately reinterprets
the meaning of these cultic titles. Aphrodite was no less a goddess of sexual desire under her
title of Ourania, which was derived, as we have seen, from her Semitic counterpart, who was
not noted for her high-mindedness; and far from bearing immoral connotations, Aphrodite’s
title of Pandemos represents her as a civic goddess whose worship unites the whole people.

At Athens, Aphrodite Pandemos was a quiet and staid marriage-goddess, in whose worship
nothing untoward seems to have taken place; according to local legend, Theseus founded the
cult after he had united the people of Attica into a single state.263 Plato’s reinterpretation of
these titles (if it was indeed his own) left its mark on the subsequent tradition nonetheless.
Theocritus, for instance, opposes Aphrodite Ourania to Aphrodite Pandemos in one of his
epigrams; and Pausanias reports a Theban tradition which claimed that Harmonia (the divine
wife of the ﬁrst king of the city, see p. 297) had given Aphrodite her title of Ourania in
relation to love that was free from the lust of the body, and of Pandemos in relation to carnal
love.264 If exception is made for certain local exoticisms, such as the temple-prostitutes at
Corinth, the public cult of Aphrodite in Greece was eminently respectable for the most part.
In 464 BC, a Corinthian athlete called Xenophon vowed to dedicate a hundred prosti-
tutes to the service of Aphrodite in his native city if he won an Olympian victory. When
the vow was due to be fulﬁlled after he won a double victory in the foot-race and pankration
(all-in wrestling), Pindar was commissioned to write an ode to be sung in Aphrodite’s temple,
and responded with his customary panache by writing a poem that began,
Guest-loving girls, servants of Persuasion [Peitho, see below] in wealthy Corinth, who
burn the golden tears of fresh incense, often soaring upward in your minds to
Aphrodite, the heavenly mother of loves, she who has granted you to pluck without
reproach, girls, on lovely couches the fruit of gentle beauty . . .265
Eros and other associates of Aphrodite
As the goddess of love, Aphrodite is regularly attended by EROS, the personiﬁca-
tion of amorous desire, who fulﬁls his purposes by inspiring love in gods and mortals
alike. After initially presenting him as a primordial cosmogonic power (see p. 23),
the Theogony later reports that he attended Aphrodite from the time of her birth,
and that he accompanied her to Olympos when she ascended to join the other
gods.266 In the subsequent literature, he is often tied to her even more closely, as
being not merely her attendant but her son; the idea ﬁrst appears in a fragment
from Simonides, which describes him as being the merciless child whom she bore
to Ares.267 On this matter of his birth, however, all manner of conﬂicting sugges-
tions were offered by the poets and inventors of cosmogonies. The early lyric poets
have much to say about Eros and about the irresistible power that he exerts on his
victims. Bitter-sweet, a loosener of limbs, he shakes the poet’s heart like a wind
descending on the mountain oaks; he is also a weaver of tales, an enchanter, who
uses his magical arts to cast his victim into the nets of Aphrodite.268 Euripides is
the ﬁrst author to suggest that he works this compulsion by means of his arrows.269
In addition to being a god of the poets and cosmogonists, he was honoured quite
extensively in cult. Some of his cults were certainly very old, notably that at Thespiai,
where he was represented by an aniconic stone image which was doubtless of vener-
able antiquity.270 His cult and images in the gymnasia reﬂect his concern with
homosexual love, as awakened by the bodily attractions of young men and boys. In
the Hellenistic period, as the idea of romantic love came increasingly to the fore in
literature, Eros came to be imagined above all as a capricious and playful child-god;
rather than being shown as a handsome young athlete, or as a young boy as in
classical art, he was now generally shown as a pretty child, a little winged archer
who was ever ready to work mischief on gods or mortals with his arrows. This is
— The younger Olympian gods and goddesses —
196

the form in which he has usually been imagined since the Renaissance, as innocuous
Cupid rather than the old Greek Eros.
Although Eros can quite often be seen ﬂuttering around in seduction-scenes or
abduction-scenes on Attic vases, he is seldom introduced into mythical narratives,
appearing for the most part in later writings and in a subordinate role, as part of
the divine machinery for making one person fall in love with another. In Apollonius’
Hellenistic epic, for instance, Aphrodite approaches her naughty and disobedient
son to ask him to cause Medeia to fall in love with Jason; and she wins his compli-
ance by promising to give him a beautiful ball, all golden except where it was
overlaid with a spiral of dark blue, a marvel that had been made for the infant Zeus
by his nurse Adrasteia.271 Or in Ovid’s Metamorphoses, Apollo rebukes the child-god
for presuming to employ his own favourite weapon, the bow, so annoying the boy
that he pays Apollo back by shooting a sharp golden arrow into him to cause him
to fall in love with the nymph Daphne (see p. 155), and a blunt lead-tipped arrow
into Daphne to cause her to take an aversion to her new admirer.272
As a fairy-tale with a considerable allegorical content, the story of Cupid (i.e. Eros) and
Psyche (the soul personiﬁed) in Apuleius’ Golden Ass stands apart from the ordinary myth-
ology of Eros. It was probably based on a Hellenistic original. According to this tale, Psyche
was a young princess who became so celebrated for her beauty that Aphrodite grew jealous
and sent Cupid to wreak vengeance on her, telling him to make her fall in love with some
utterly worthless man; but the plan went wrong because Cupid himself fell in love with the
girl. Now Psyche was so extremely beautiful that no man dared to court her; and when her
parents consulted an oracle of Apollo about the matter, they were told to expose her in
bridal robes on a mountain, where some apparently fearsome bridegroom would come to
claim her. When they did so, she was carried away by the wind to a deep valley, and found
her way into a wondrously beautiful palace nearby. This turned out to be a magical palace
where she was tended by invisible servants; and Cupid visited her there in her bedroom each
night, and made love to her in the dark without revealing his identity. In the mean time,
her two elder sisters had set out in search of her, and Cupid allowed them to see her, though
against his better judgement, warning her to ignore them if they tried to persuade her to
discover what he looked like. Such was their envy at her good fortune that they cast her
into a panic by suggesting that her mysterious husband was an enormous snake who would
ﬁnally swallow her alive. At their urging, she hid a knife and a lamp in her bedroom so as
to kill him while he was asleep; but when she shone the lamp on him to do so, she saw
that he was a winged youth of surpassing beauty and fell more in love with him than ever.
All might have been well if some scalding oil from the lamp had not dripped on to his
shoulder, causing him to wake with a start and then abandon her in anger at her disobedi-
ence. Overcome by regret and longing, the unfortunate Psyche, who was pregnant by now,
roamed the world in search of him until she ﬁnally fell into the hands of Aphrodite, who
forced her to undertake four seemingly impossible tasks. She was to separate a large heap
of seeds and grains into its different components in a single day; but the ants of the neigh-
bourhood took pity on her and she achieved the task with their aid. She was to fetch some
wool from a ﬂock of homicidal sheep; but a reed was stirred by some divine wind to tell
her to wait until they were asleep, and then collect the wool that had become snagged on
the thorns of the surrounding plants. She was sent to fetch a jar of water from the sacred
streams of the Styx; but the eagle of Zeus remembered a debt that he owed to Cupid (who
had helped him to carry off Ganymedes) and fetched the water on her behalf. And ﬁnally,

she was to fetch Persephone’s beauty-casket from the Underworld. She succeeded once again,
with some supernatural aid, but disaster struck when she allowed her curiosity to get the
better of her and opened the casket, for she was immediately overcome by a death-like sleep.
Cupid had recovered from his wound in the meantime, and had come to miss Psyche so
greatly that he had ﬂown off to ﬁnd her. On his arrival, he shut the cloud of sleep back
into the chest and awakened Psyche by pricking her with one of his arrows. He then sought
the permission of Zeus to take her up to heaven, where she lived with him as his immortal
wife, bearing him a child called Voluptas (Pleasure).273
Two lesser ﬁgures who are mentioned as companions of Aphrodite (and sometimes
of other gracious female deities such as the Charites and Horai) are HIMEROS and
POTHOS, two personiﬁcations of amorous yearning. Hesiod states that Himeros –
whose name means much the same as that of Eros – attended Aphrodite from 
her birth along with Eros, and that his house lay on Olympos close to those of the
Muses and Charites.274 Pothos (Desire, Yearning) enters the literary record some-
what later, but then appears much more frequently. Aeschylus is the ﬁrst author 
to refer to him unequivocally as a personiﬁed being, mentioning him together 
with Peitho (the personiﬁcation of amatory persuasion) as a child and assistant of
Aphrodite.275 A purely decorative and allegorical being, he has no myths at all.
Eros had a counterpart or double in ANTEROS (Counter-love, Love Returned); the altar 
of Anteros near the Acropolis at Athens had the following tale attached to it. An Athenian
boy called Meles spurned the love of a metic (resident alien) called Timagoras, and told him
to jump off the Acropolis if he really wanted to prove his love. But when the despairing
Timagoras took him at his word and actually did so, Meles felt such remorse that he threw
himself down from the same spot. In commemoration, the metics set up the altar of
Anteros.276 Pausanias mentions that there was a relief at the youths’ training-ground at Elis
that showed Anteros trying to wrest a palm-branch from Eros.277
Aphrodite and Adonis
In considering the myths of Aphrodite herself, we will do well to begin with the
most easterly stories, of which the best known is that of her love for ADONIS; for
here we have, without a doubt, the familiar oriental tale of the Great Mother and
her divine lover. The name Adonis is probably derived from the Semitic adon, lord,
and he is quite often identiﬁed with Tammuz, as for instance in the vulgate of
Ezekiel.278 To begin with the story of his birth, Myrrha (or Smyrna), the daughter
of Theias, king of Assyria (or of Kinyras, see below), refused to honour Aphrodite,
provoking the goddess to inspire her with an incestuous passion for her own father.
With the connivance of her nurse, she slipped into his bed under cover of darkness,
and he slept with her for twelve nights without realizing who she was; but when
he discovered at last, he was horriﬁed and chased after her sword in hand. As he
was about to catch up with her, she prayed to the gods to be removed from human
sight, and they responded by turning her into the tree that bears her name, the
myrrh-tree (myrrha or smyrna in Greek). After the usual time of gestation for a
human child, the bark of the tree broke open and Adonis was brought to birth.279
— The younger Olympian gods and goddesses —
198

In Antoninus’ version, which may have been derived from Nicander, Theias became curious
about the identity of his mistress after she had become pregnant, and shone a light on her
one night. In the anguish of the moment, she gave birth to her child prematurely, and
prayed to be removed from the company of both the living and the dead; and Zeus responded
by turning her into a myrrh-tree, which weeps resinous tears every year. Her father
committed suicide for his own part.280 Adonis was usually said to have been born from the
tree, however, as in the version above. His mother is often described as a daughter of Kinyras
(properly a king of Cyprus, see p. 573, although Hyginus refers to him as a king of Assyria
by confusion with Theias),281 and Aphrodite is often said to have performed the transfor-
mation.282 In the lengthy narrative by Ovid, Myrrha took to ﬂight after her father Kinyras
discovered her identity by shining a lamp on her. She wandered for nine months until she
arrived at the land of the Sabaeans in south-western Arabia (which was the main source of
myrrh and frankincense in ancient times, and thus a suitable place for her transformation).
She was turned into a tree there when she prayed to be removed from the living and the
dead, and gave birth to her child in that form.283
The earliest evidence for Adonis is contained in reports on the Hesiodic corpus (probably
the Catalogue in this case); he was apparently described there as a son of Phoinix, son of
Agenor, and there may have been no exceptional story associated with his birth.284
When Aphrodite caught sight of the infant Adonis, she was so entranced by his
beauty that she shut him up in a chest to conceal him from the other gods, and
entrusted him to Persephone; but Persephone was equally impressed by his beauty
and wanted to keep him for herself. The dispute was referred to Zeus, who decided
that Adonis should spend a third of each year with each goddess and the rest of the
year by himself. Since Adonis preferred to spend his own share of the year with
Aphrodite, he spent the greater part of his time with her until she was robbed of
his company by his early death; for as soon as he was old enough, he began to go
out hunting, and was gored to death by a wild boar.285 His death was sometimes
regarded as having been more than an accident, for some accounts state that the
war-god Ares, as the lover or husband of Aphrodite, sent the boar against him out
of jealousy, or transformed himself into a boar to attack him;286 or else Artemis
sent the boar against him287 (presumably to punish Aphrodite for having caused
the death of her own favourite, Hippolytos, see p. 358).
In a less orthodox account of the arbitration between Aphrodite and Persephone, Zeus dele-
gated the decision to the Muse Kalliope, who ordered that Adonis should spend half of the
year with each goddess; and Aphrodite was so enraged by her judgement that she incited
the women of Thrace to dismember Orpheus (here described as a son of Kalliope).288
Ovid offers a divergent account of Adonis’ story, saying that he was brought up by local
nymphs after he was born from the myrrh-tree in Arabia, and ﬁrst attracted the attention
and love of Aphrodite when he grew up to become an exceptionally handsome young man.
Since hunting was his main enthusiasm, she abandoned her usual habits and haunts to follow
him through the wilds on his hunting-trips, tucking her clothes up to her knees just as
though she were Artemis. She kept well clear of the ﬁercest beasts, however, such as lions,
wolves and boars, and urged her young favourite to do the same, warning that his youthful
beauty was no defence against their teeth and claws. Her worst fears were realized when he
was carried away by his zeal one day and tried to kill a wild boar, for it leapt up and fatally
wounded him with a bite in the groin.289

According to Ovid, the grief-stricken Aphrodite sprinkled Adonis’ blood with nectar,
causing a fragile blood-red ﬂower, the anemone, to spring up from it.290 Or in another
account, the ﬁrst rose sprang up from the blood of Adonis, while the anemone sprang from
Aphrodite’s tears; or the anemone, which had previously been white, was stained red by the
blood of Adonis, and the rose was turned red likewise when Aphrodite pricked herself on
a thorn as she was wandering around bare-footed in her grief; or Adonis was transformed
into the rose.291
Under the prettiness of this legend, we can see the outlines of an oriental myth of
the Great Mother and of her lover who dies as the vegetation dies, but always comes
to life again. This is most obvious in the story in which he spends part of the year
– evidently the dead season – with Persephone, queen of the Underworld, but returns
for the rest of the year to the arms of Aphrodite. This is simply a repetition, of
course in a rather different context, of the myth in which Persephone herself spends
part of the year below with Hades and part above with her mother, the corn-goddess
Demeter (see p. 128). The death of the youthful favourite at the time of the dying
of nature is also ﬁgured in the story of his premature death in the hunting-ﬁeld.
His cult as a dying god is already in evidence in the poetry of Sappho (late seventh
century BC) and was popular in Greece from the ﬁfth century. From Sappho we have
the following two lines: ‘Tender Adonis is dying, Kytherea [i.e. Aphrodite]; what
are we to do?’, ‘Beat your breasts, girls, and rend your robes’; and a complete, if
more artiﬁcial, lament for Adonis is preserved among the bucolic poetry of the
Hellenistic period.292 Besides the ceremonial singing and wailing of dirges, which
were sometimes conducted over an efﬁgy of the dead boy, the cult of Adonis, which
was a women’s cult for the most part, involved the preparation of ‘gardens of Adonis’,
in which plants were germinated in very shallow soil in pots or potsherds, and so
grew up with unnatural speed and withered just as quickly.293
How Aphrodite came to conceive Aineias to Anchises; 
Aphrodite, Ares and Hephaistos
The story of Aphrodite and ANCHISES follows a similar pattern in so far as the
goddess, who here assumes the traits of the Great Mother of Ida, becomes involved
in a liaison with a younger male partner in one of the lands that were associated
with the Asianic mother-goddess. In its setting in Greek myth, however, the tale
is woven into heroic mythology to account for the origin of a notable hero. Anchises
is described in the Iliad and subsequent tradition as a grandson of Tros, the eponym
of the land of Troy, and a member of the junior branch of the royal family, 
whose members lived outside the city on Mt Ida (see p. 522).294 Either through the
machinations of Zeus, who wanted to be avenged on Aphrodite for the trouble 
that she had caused to him and the other gods by inspiring them with love for
mortals,295 or else out of sheer wantonness of desire, she conceived a passion for
Anchises when he was a handsome young man, and visited him one day as he was
tending his cattle on Ida. As the story is recounted in the Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite,
she went to her precinct at Paphos on Cyprus beforehand to be bathed and bedecked
by the Graces, and then appeared to Anchises in the guise of a Phrygian princess.
— The younger Olympian gods and goddesses —
200

She told him that Hermes had carried her off to Mt Ida to become his wife, and
proposed that they should consummate their union without delay. Under the inﬂu-
ence of the desire that she inspired in him, he took her by the hand and led her to
his bed, which was covered with soft pelts of bears and lions that he had killed in
the high mountains. She put him to sleep for a while after their love-making and
ﬁnally revealed her true identity when he awoke.296 He was much alarmed, fearing
that he would become ‘strengthless’ (i.e. impotent) after sleeping with such a
goddess; but she reassured him and told him that she would bear him a son, Aineias,
who would be reared by the mountain nymphs until she brought the child to him
in his ﬁfth year. Before departing, she ordered him to say nothing of their encounter
and to pass off Aineias as a child of his by a local nymph, warning him that Zeus
would strike him with a thunderbolt if he was foolish enough to boast of having
slept with her.297 According to some later sources, he was indeed struck by a thun-
derbolt after revealing the secret (while drunk in one account), and was crippled or
blinded as a consequence. This feature of the story was probably familiar by the
classical period since a fragment from Sophocles’ Laokoon refers to Anchises’ ‘thunder-
stricken back’.298
So far, we have been dealing with legends that represent the goddess, not as
married, but as forming more or less temporary unions with someone much inferior
to herself – a proceeding quite characteristic of eastern goddesses, who are essen-
tially mothers, not wives, and beside whom their lovers or husbands sink into
comparative insigniﬁcance, even if some of them are not unimportant gods. Within
the Olympian circle, she is linked to two gods, the ﬁre-god Hephaistos, who was
of eastern origin like herself, and the war-god Ares. In a famous tale in the Odyssey,
Hephaistos is presented as her husband, and he catches her out when she secretly
engages in an adulterous love affair with Ares. He learned of this from the sun-god
Helios, who can see everything as he travels across the sky and came to tell him
that Ares had been sleeping with his wife in his own home. Not daring to confront
Ares on equal terms, he fashioned a subtle net which was immensely strong but so
ﬁnely spun as to be invisible, and spread it around his bed, causing the guilty couple
to be caught up in it when they lay down to make love; and he then summoned
the other gods to witness the sight. The goddesses stayed in their homes for shame,
but all the gods hurried to the scene, and unquenchable laughter arose among them
when they saw the effects of Hephaistos’ ingenuity. Hephaistos was very angry at
ﬁrst and talked of a divorce, threatening to reclaim the bride-price that he had paid
to Zeus for his faithless daughter; but Poseidon paciﬁed him by promising to stand
surety for the compensation that was due to a wronged husband. So he released the
captives from the net, allowing Ares to depart to his home in Thrace and Aphrodite
to set off for her temple at Paphos in Cyprus, where she was bathed and adorned
by the Graces.299 This tale is obviously not meant to be taken too seriously; indeed,
Hephaistos is not a very serious ﬁgure in mythology, as we have seen.
Although it is often stated on the basis of this story that Aphrodite was married
to Hephaistos, as though that were the regular tradition in antiquity, this Homeric
passage is in fact rather exceptional in that regard. Hephaistos has another wife in
the Theogony and indeed in the Iliad (see p. 167), and it is clear from visual images
from the archaic period onwards – and literary references from the classical period

onwards – that Ares was generally regarded as the husband of Aphrodite, or at least
as her accredited lover. On the François vase, for instance, from the early sixth
century BC, she is shown arriving at the marriage of Peleus in the same chariot as
Ares (just as Zeus arrives with Hera, and Poseidon with Amphitrite), while Pindar
and Aeschylus refer to him directly as her husband.300 For the children who are
credited to the couple in the Theogony and elsewhere, see p. 169. The two deities
were connected in cult to some extent, sharing a temple for example on the road
between Argos and Mantineia.301 Aphrodite could sometimes be a martial goddess,
as in her Spartan cult as Aphrodite Areia,302 but it is hard to say whether this had
anything to do with her mythical union with Ares. Their union could be viewed
in any case as a piquant union of opposites, which resulted most appropriately in
the birth of a daughter called Harmonia.303
Although Aphrodite was sometimes credited with various other children, includ-
ing Hermaphroditos (see p. 164), Priapos (see p. 222) and Eryx (see p. 395), no
love-stories are recorded for her beyond those already mentioned. In her myths, the
love-goddess is by no means promiscuous. She occasionally intervened to help mortal
lovers, notably Paris after he judged her to be more beautiful than Hera and Athena
(see p. 443), and the suitor of Atalanta (see p. 546); and conversely, she occasion-
ally acted against mortals who refused to honour her or scorned the gift of love, as
we have just seen with Smyrna, or in the story of Hippolytos (see p. 358).
In two striking tales from the islands, Aphrodite brought a statue of a beautiful woman to
life for Pygmalion, king of Cyprus (see p. 574), and rejuvenated PHAON, a virtuous ferryman
of Mytilene in Lesbos. When she appeared to Phaon in the guise of an old woman, he showed
her every consideration and ferried her across to the mainland without demanding a fee; 
and by way of a reward, she gave him an alabaster pot containing a marvellous ointment
that would make him young and handsome when he rubbed it into his skin. The women
of Mytilene were much attracted to him thereafter, ultimately to his own detriment since
he was ﬁnally caught in adultery and executed.304 He may originally have been a ﬁgure like
Adonis (or possibly even Adonis himself under another name), since Aphrodite is also
reported to have fallen in love with him and to have hidden him in a lettuce-bed.305
A strange story suggested that the Lesbian poetess Sappho fell hopelessly in love with 
him, and committed suicide as a consequence by hurling herself from the Leucadian Rock
(a celebrated ‘lover’s leap’ on the island of Leukas in the Ionian Sea).306 The idea would
probably have been inspired by a passage in one of her poems in which she wrote about
Phaon as a legendary ﬁgure. One of Ovid’s ﬁctional letters in the Heroides is addressed from
Sappho to Phaon.307
As in mythology, so in art, Aphrodite wavers between several types. Her oriental
ﬁgures, as in the archaic idols found in Cyprus, show her in crudely naked form,
typically with one or both hands up by her breasts and with her genitals frankly
emphasized. In her earlier Greek statues, however, from the archaic and classical
periods, she is decorously draped in long robes for the most part, and possesses a
certain stiff dignity such as would not be inappropriate to Aphrodite Pandemos.
From the mid-fourth century onwards, sculptures regularly portray her in graciously
naked or semi-naked form, in images that vary with the skill of the artist from
meritorious studies of the body of a healthy and well-proportioned woman to
— The younger Olympian gods and goddesses —
202

monuments that convey a suggestion of an ideal beauty. The Cnidian Aphrodite 
of Praxiteles (c. 350 BC, now lost, but familiar from copies), which showed her
laying her clothing aside as she was about to enter her bath, became her most cele-
brated image in Graeco-Roman antiquity. The most popular of her surviving statues,
the Venus de Milo (i.e. Aphrodite of Melos) in the Louvre, is an original work from
the second century BC.

LESSER DEITIES AND 
NATURE-SPIRITS

B
efore we pass on from divine to heroic mythology, there are various lesser
divinities who remain to be considered. From among the children who were
fathered by Zeus on goddesses other than Hera (see pp. 76ff), three gracious groups
of sister-deities, the Muses, Charites (Graces) and Horai (Seasons), have yet to be
discussed. Ranking somewhere between deities such as these and the mortal race 
were the countless nature-spirits who haunted the waters, countryside and wilderness.
Of most importance in everyday belief were the female spirits, the nymphs, familiar
presences who were very popular in rural cult; their main male equivalents, the Satyrs
and Seilenoi, belonged more to the world of art and literature, as mythical attendants
of Dionysos. These male nature-spirits had animal features and ill-controlled
appetites, as did the rustic god Pan, who originated in Arcadia as a god of shepherds
and herdsmen, and ﬁgures in characteristic myths as a frustrated lover. The Phrygian
myth of Attis and Kybele strikes a more exotic note in so far as it ﬁnds a place in the
corpus of Greek mythology. We will conclude by examining various minor gods and
daimones who are not included in Hesiod’s genealogies, ranging from the Kouretes
and Korybantes to the lustful Priapos and the wedding-god Hymenaios.
The Muses
In Hesiod’s account, as we have seen, the MUSES (Mousai) were born to Zeus by
Mnemosyne, the personiﬁcation of Memory;1 but a rival genealogy, which may have
originated in a cosmological poem by Alcman (seventh century BC), claimed that
they were born in the very earliest times as daughters of Ouranos and Gaia.2 Some
authors reconciled the two accounts by suggesting that there were two generations
of Muses, the ancient Muses who were daughters of Heaven and their later-born
companions who were daughters of Zeus.3
The Muses ﬁrst appear in the works of Homer and Hesiod as goddesses on whom
the epic poet relies for his inspiration, his memory and aspects of his knowledge. In
the introductory section of the Theogony, Hesiod tells how the Muses of Mt Helikon
once approached him as he was shepherding his ﬂocks under the mountain and
granted him his gift of song, breathing a divine voice into him to enable him to
celebrate things that will be and things that have been in times gone by.4 Scholars
CHAPTER SIX
204

have been unable to agree on whether the poet was describing a genuine vision or
dream of some kind or was merely following a literary convention. Hesiod goes on to
say that the Muses delight the heart of their father Zeus on Olympos by singing of
things past, present and future, and of the race of the gods, and of mortals and giants.5
In contrast to poets of more recent times, who have tended to appeal to their Muse as
a source of poetic afﬂatus, ancient poets place more emphasis on the wisdom and
knowledge of the Muses, as deities who know all that is worth telling and can give
the poet the ability to tell it, and also to remember it (a point that was especially
important to oral poets of early times). Homer not only invokes the Muse as an
unnamed goddess at the beginning of the Iliad, but appeals to the Muses at greater
length in the second book of the epic before providing his long muster-role of the
Greek commanders and their forces;6 although this might not seem the most poetic
part of the poem, it contains quantities of detailed and irreplaceable information
about the heroic past that needed to be remembered if it was to be passed on to future
generations. It is still invaluable to the modern mythologist. Homer tells the Muses
that he needs their aid at this point because they are ‘deities and are present at all
things, and know all things, while we hear no more than a rumour and have no know-
ledge’.7 As time passed, these wise and helpful goddesses came to be enrolled as the
patrons of other forms of literature as they developed, and, by a natural extension, of
other arts and intellectual pursuits also, such as philosophy and astronomy.
According to the standard tradition, as established by Hesiod, there were nine
Muses named Kleio, Euterpe, Thaleia, Melpomene, Terpsichore, Erato, Polhymnia,
Ourania and Kalliope.8 In local cult and tradition, however, they were sometimes
represented as being fewer in number and of different name (see below). They are
mentioned as being nine in number in a passage in the Odyssey,9 but in a part of
the poem that may well have been added after Homer’s time. Their pretty ‘speaking
names’, which were probably invented by Hesiod himself, would originally have
been devised to reﬂect aspects of their common nature and shared activities; since
they liked to dance and sing, for instance, ‘delighting in their beautiful voice (opi
kale¯i)’,10 four of them were called Kalliope, Polhymnia (Many Songs), Melpomene
(she who sings) and Terpsichore (Delighting in the Dance). It was not until a consid-
erably later period that authors tried to assign individual functions to each of the
Muses in accordance with the speciﬁc meaning of her name. Kalliope of the beau-
tiful voice could then be regarded as the Muse of epic poetry speciﬁcally, and
Polhymnia as the Muse who concerned herself with hymns to the gods (or later,
pantomime), and Terpsichore as the Muse of choral lyric and dancing. Kleio (or Clio
in Latin form) is still familiar as the Muse of history, a responsibility that she
acquired because her name might suggest that she celebrates (kleiei) the glorious
deeds (kleia) of heroes and heroines of the past. Thaleia (Good Cheer) could be
ﬁttingly enlisted as the Muse of comedy, Ourania (the Heavenly) as the Muse of
astronomy, Erato (the Lovely or Desirable) as the Muse of lyric poetry, which is so
often erotic in content, and Euterpe (she that gladdens) as the Muse of ﬂute-playing.
Melpomene for her part commonly presided over tragedy. These are merely examples,
since individual Muses are credited with different functions in different sources.11
This division of labours should not be taken too seriously, however, for it was simply
a game at the best and an exercise in pedantry at the worst.

205

Although the name of the Muses is apparently of Indo-European origin, its
etymology remains a matter for conjecture. The principal centres of their cult in
early times were the areas of Mt Olympos in the north-east (including Pieria) and
of Mt Helikon in Boeotia, but they had lesser cults throughout the Greek world.
Homer refers to them as the Olympian Muses, stating that they had their homes
on Mt Olympos, while Hesiod, as a Boeotian, received his call from them in their
main southern haunts, and tells how they would sing and dance on Helikon after
ﬁrst bathing in a spring on that mountain.12 At the beginning of the Works and
Days, however, Hesiod refers to them as ‘Muses from Pieria’, and he reports corre-
spondingly in the Theogony that they were born there.13 In relation to their different
haunts, they could be called the Helikonian or Olympian Muses (both titles are
applied by Hesiod) or the Pierian Muses (a title that ﬁrst appears in Solon and the
Hesiodic Shield14); but the use of such titles in no way implies that there was more
than one group of Muses. They are known as goddesses of song and dance from the
time of our earliest records; although it has often been suggested that they may
have originated as water-spirits or spring-nymphs, the idea is not conﬁrmed by any
deﬁnite evidence from the early tradition. The Romans identiﬁed them with some
obscure deities of their own, the Camenae, who had a sacred grove and spring outside
the Porta Capena at Rome.
The name and number of the Muses show some variation in local cult and tradition. At
Sicyon, for instance, three Muses were honoured, and there are also accounts in which they
were ﬁve, seven or eight in number. Pausanias claims that the Helikonian Muses were origin-
ally three in number, but the names that he cites for them – Melete, Mneme and Aoide,
i.e. Study, Memory and Song – are of such a nature that it is unlikely that he is referring
to a genuinely ancient tradition.15
Like other deities, the Muses were jealous of their honour. Their only myths of any
real signiﬁcance tell how they punished mortals who dared to challenge them as
singers. The Thracian bard THAMYRIS (or Thamyras), who was a son of the myth-
ical musician Philammon (see p. 435), became so skilled at singing to the lyre
(kithara) that he boasted that he could outsing even the Muses themselves. As the
story is recounted by Homer, they encountered him at Dorion, a town in Nestor’s
kingdom in the western Peloponnese, and were so angered by his presumptuous
boast that ‘they maimed him, and took away his wondrous gift of song and caused
him to forget his lyre-playing’.16 Later sources specify that they blinded him (as
may in fact have been Homer’s meaning, even if his language is vague). The next
full account is provided by the Hellenistic mythographer Asclepiades, who prob-
ably relied on a tragic source. Thamyris is now said to have engaged in a contest 
with the Muses in his homeland in Thrace, on the agreement that he would be able
to sleep with all of them if he won (in accordance with the polygynous customs of
the land), but that they would be able to treat him just as they wished if he should
lose. When he was defeated, as was inevitably the case, they proceeded to rob him
of his eyes.17 Apollodorus provides a very similar account, saying that they deprived
him of his eyes and also of his skills as a minstrel.18 His stage-mask in tragedy
— Lesser deities and nature-spirits —
206

showed his right eye as black and his left eye as white,19 presumably to illustrate
his condition before and after his defeat; Sophocles wrote a play about him, as
perhaps did Aeschylus too.
In a later story of this kind, probably of Hellenistic origin, the Muses met with
a challenge from the PIERIDES or EMATHIDES, the daughters of Pieros, king of
Emathia or Pella in Macedonia. In the version ascribed to Nicander, Pieros, an earth-
born king of Emathia, fathered a family of nine daughters at much the same time
as the Muses were fathered by Zeus. These daughters, the Emathides, formed a choir
to rival that of the Muses, and the two groups put their skills to the test in a
singing-contest on Mt Helikon. When the Emathides raised their voices, the whole
of nature darkened and nothing paid heed to their chorus; but when the Muses
sang, the sky and stars and the sea and rivers ceased from their motions, and 
Mt Helikon swelled with pleasure, rising up into the sky until Pegasos, at the order
of Poseidon, halted it by striking its summit with his hoof. To punish the Emathides
for having presumed to challenge them, the Muses transformed them into birds of
various different kinds.20 Or in Ovid’s account, the contest was judged by a jury of
nymphs, who voted unanimously in favour of the Muses; and when the Pierides
reacted to their defeat by abusing the victors, the Muses transformed them into
magpies, harsh-voiced birds that can imitate human speech.21 Since Pierides was a
title that could be applied to the Muses in connection with their cult in Pieria, it
is not hard to see how the idea could have arisen of a contest between them and
the daughters of the eponym of Pieria. According to a strange legend of a compar-
able nature, Hera once persuaded the Sirens to match their voices against those of
the Muses, but the Muses won and plucked out the feathers of the Sirens (who had
bird-like bodies, see p. 496) to make crowns for themselves.22
There is otherwise little to record about the Muses as mythical ﬁgures. It would
naturally be supposed that they would sing and dance at the gatherings of the gods,
perhaps with Apollo, another great patron of music, as their companion and leader
(hence his title of Mousagetes, or Leader of the Muses); and on special occasions,
they might sing in the presence of mortals on the earth below, as when they led
the wedding-songs at the marriages of Kadmos and Peleus (see. pp. 54 and 297),
or arrived with Thetis and the Nereids to sing dirges for the dead Achilles (see 
p. 468). Although they might be best imagined as a group of virgin goddesses,
children are quite often ascribed to one or another of them, above all because they
seemed to be appropriate mothers for mythical musicians. Singers or dancers such
as Orpheus and Linos or the Sirens and Korybantes are therefore regularly identi-
ﬁed as offspring of a Muse.23
According to a curious tale recorded by Ovid alone, Pyreneus, king of Daulis in Central
Greece, once offered shelter to the Muses when they were caught by a rainstorm as they
were travelling to their temple on Mt Parnassos. Although he recognized who they were
and assumed a humble and reverent tone when inviting them into his palace, he barred his
doors to prevent them from leaving and then tried to rape them. They simply ﬂew away,
however, and when Pyreneus tried to chase after them by launching himself from the battle-
ments, he plunged headlong to the ground below and was killed. This Pyreneus is otherwise
unknown; one may suspect that his story had become distorted in the transmission.24

The Charites (Graces) and Horai (Seasons)
The CHARITES were lovely daughters of Zeus, usually thought to be three in
number, who were born to him by the Okeanid Eurynome (see p. 78).25 They are
known as the GRACES in English in accordance with Latin usage (for their name
was translated into Gratiae in Latin). As gracious goddesses who embody all that is
beautiful and charming, and can lend grace and allure (charis) to works of art and
nature and every area of life, they appear regularly as associates of the Muses and
of Aphrodite. In the Iliad, the goddess of love wears an immortal robe which had
been woven for her by the Charites, and in Demodokos’ minstrel-song in the Odyssey,
she is bathed, anointed and dressed by them in her sanctuary in Cyprus after being
caught in adultery by Ares (see p. 201).26 Or in the Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite, she
is bathed and dressed by them in happier circumstances before she sets off to seduce
Anchises.27 Hesiod remarks that their home on Olympos lies beside that of the
Muses,28 who were often imagined as singing and dancing in their company. Sappho
invokes them in three of her surviving poems, twice in conjunction with the Muses;
and Pindar refers to them with notable frequency as deities who shed grace on poetry
and festal occasions and many areas of life.29
Although their number varies, they are generally represented as a triad on the
authority of Hesiod, who calls them Aglaia (Splendour), Euphrosyne (Joy) and
Thaleia (Good Cheer).30 As these names might suggest, they were particularly asso-
ciated with the grace and delight of social gatherings and festivities. Pindar remarks
that ‘not even the gods can order dances and feasts without the aid of the holy
Charites’;31 and they often appear in art and literature accordingly as goddesses 
who dance at the gatherings of the gods.32 There is little doubt, however, that they
were originally nature-goddesses who caused the crops and vegetation to ﬂourish
delightfully. This aspect of their nature is reﬂected in their names in Athenian 
cult, in which there were two Charites known as Auxo (i.e. fosterer of growth) 
and Hegemone (she who leads, sc. brings the plants forth from the earth).33
They are common enough in art, where their three attractive and maidenly ﬁgures,
initially draped, often naked in later times, were a favourite subject. The portrayal
familiar from Renaissance art, in which they are shown as a naked and interlaced
group, one viewed from the back and two from the front, is derived from a stan-
dard Hellenistic type. Two individual Charites are mentioned in the early tradition
as marriage-partners; in the Theogony, Hephaistos is said to have married Aglaia, the
youngest of the sisters, and in the Iliad, Hera promises Pasithea, ‘one of the younger
Charites’ (here apparently more than three in number), to Hypnos for lulling Zeus
to sleep on her behalf (see p. 30).34 The most ancient centre of the cult of the
Charites was thought to have been Orchomenos in Boeotia, where they were
honoured in the form of stones that were said to have fallen from the heavens in
the heroic era.35
The HORAI or SEASONS, another gracious set of sister-goddesses, bear some
resemblance to the Charites but maintain a closer connection with the fruits of the
earth. Although they are sometimes known as the Hours, their name does not really
mean hour in the English or Latin sense, but simply time or season, and they repre-
sent the seasons of the year. This accounts in part for their varying numbers, for the
— Lesser deities and nature-spirits —
208

ancients recognized anything from two seasons (i.e. summer and winter) up to the
four that are usually acknowledged in temperate zones nowadays. They were most
commonly imagined as being three in number (representing spring, summer and
winter); and as well as being concerned with growth and fertility in connection 
with the turning year, they also acquired moral and social concerns as goddesses
who protected the good order that is essential for the ﬂourishing of agriculture and
prosperity in general. This is reﬂected in their names in the Theogony, which calls
them Eunomia, Dike and Eirene, in other words, Good Order, Justice and Peace.36
Their agricultural concerns remained primary, however, in what little cult they had,
as might be inferred from their cultic titles at Athens, where they were known as
Thallo and Karpo (i.e. she who causes to sprout and to fruit respectively).37 Like
the Charites, they have no proper stories of their own, but appear in an accom-
panying role as charming minor deities who attend on the greater ones, especially
Aphrodite, and dance at the gatherings of the gods. In the Homeric Hymn (6) to
Aphrodite, they are said to have clothed the new-born Aphrodite when she emerged
from the sea at Cyprus, and to have adorned her with gold and jewels before
conducting her up to Olympos to join the other gods.38 They are credited with a
special duty in the Iliad as the gate-keepers of Olympos who are responsible for
opening and closing the cloud-barriers, an idea that may have arisen because they
were associated with the changing weather.39 Hesiod classes them as daughters of
Zeus and Themis (see p. 78).
The Nymphs
Some of the most appealing ﬁgures in ancient mythology and folklore are the
multitude of NYMPHS (Nymphai) who were thought to inhabit nature in many of
its aspects as spirits of the meadows and mountains, of trees and groves, of springs,
streams and the sea. Their name literally means ‘young marriageable women’ or 
the like. Although some who were classed as nymphs could be quite important
goddesses, as in the case of some of the Okeanids and Nereids (e.g. Amphitrite,
Thetis), the mass of the nymphs were semi-divinities of comparatively minor status.
They were of considerable signiﬁcance in popular cult, however, precisely because
they could be regarded as more accessible than the grander deities of public cult, and
as beings who were more likely to be sympathetic to the everyday worries of mortals,
especially those of women. They appear very frequently in myth, though often in a
supporting or purely decorative role. For Hesiod’s account of the origin of the 
Meliai (strictly ash-tree nymphs, but probably meaning tree-nymphs in general 
here), see p. 33. Homer refers to the nymphs as daughters of Zeus;40 Odysseus invokes
them as such on two occasions when offering sacriﬁce and appealing for 
their aid, and they help him to acquire food at one point by driving wild goats
towards him and his men.41 They live on the fringes of divine society; when Zeus
orders Themis to summon a general assembly of the gods in the Iliad, they attend,
as do the river-gods, ‘for none of the rivers failed to come, apart from Okeanos, 
and none of the nymphs who haunt the lovely groves and the springs of rivers 
and the grassy water-meadows’.42 Nymphs attended Artemis on her hunting-trips

(as already mentioned by Homer, see p. 188) and Dionysos on his revels; they 
were available to act as nurses to infant gods, such as Zeus and Dionysos (see 
pp. 75 and 172), and indeed to mortals on occasion, as in the case of Aineias 
(see p. 201); they can often be found in the upper reaches of heroic genealogies as
the wives of earthborn ﬁrst men and primordial rulers; and as ﬁgures of greater indi-
viduality, they regularly appear in transformation myths, especially in those that
were devised (mostly at a fairly late period) to account for the origin of plants and
springs. They are represented one and all as beautiful and youthful, and fond of
music and dancing, and very often as amorous, for they appear again and again as
the partners in love not only of Satyrs but of gods and mortals too. They have
prophetic powers, and can exert a strange spell on mortals, causing them to become
nymphole¯ptai, or ﬁlled with divine madness. Like the fairies of later folklore, whom
they greatly resemble in some respects, they could become formidable when crossed
(as we will see).
Nymphs were divided into different categories according to the provinces of nature
that they inhabited or animated. There were nymphs of the hills, dales, pastures
and mountains, nymphs of springs, rivers, lakes and the sea, and wood-nymphs and
tree-nymphs. Apart from the Okeanids and Nereids, who have already been dis-
cussed, the only nymphs who are likely to be encountered in translated literature
under their Greek titles are the Dryads and Hamadryads (Dryades, Hamadryades),
who were tree-nymphs, the Naiads (Naiades), who were water-nymphs, whether 
of springs, rivers or lakes, and perhaps also the Oreads (Oreiades), who were 
mountain-nymphs.
There is no end to the number of different names that could be applied to nymphs; the
Naiads, for instance, could be divided into Potamiads (river-nymphs), Kreneids (spring-
nymphs), Limniads (nymphs of pools and lakes), and so on. The fact is that these were hardly
proper names at all, but feminine adjectives that could be assigned to the noun nymphe¯ at
will. Beyond a certain point, this simply became an exercise in pedantry. No orthodox or
exhaustive classiﬁcation of such beings was ever attempted, and ancient authors were often
careless or arbitrary in the application of such titles.
The Dryads, or tree-nymphs, derived their name from the word drus, which strictly meant
an oak, but could be used in a looser sense as a term for large trees in general. Hamadryads
were much the same; although ancient mythographers sometimes drew a distinction between
Hamadryads, as nymphs who lived in speciﬁc trees and perished with them, and Dryads, as
nymphs who simply lived among trees, it is most unlikely that this distinction was observed
in ordinary usage or commonly intended in mythical narratives.
Although nymphs were certainly long-lived by comparison to human beings, they
were not usually regarded as immortal. In a striking Hesiodic fragment, a naiad
nymph indicates that beings of her kind have a life-span that corresponds to almost
10,000 human generations (9,720 to be precise!), for they live ten times as long as
a phoenix, which lives nine times as long as a raven, which lives three times as long
as a stag, which lives four times as long as a crow, which sees nine generations of
men grow old.43 It was commonly supposed that tree-nymphs died when their trees
decayed or were cut down. A passage from the Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite, which
states this of mountain-nymphs in general, deserves to be quoted in full:
— Lesser deities and nature-spirits —
210

the deep-breasted mountain-nymphs . . . rank neither with mortals nor with
immortals; they live a long life, to be sure, eating divine food and joining in
lovely dances with the immortals, and with them the Seilenoi and keen-sighted
Argeiphontes [i.e. Hermes] mingle in love in the depths of delightful caves; 
but at the time of their birth, pines or high-crowned oaks spring up with
them on the nourishing earth . . . and when their fated death approaches them,
ﬁrst these beautiful trees wither on the earth and their bark shrivels around
them and their branches fall away, and then along with the trees, the souls of
the nymphs leave the light of the sun.44
As we have already seen in the case of Erysichthon (see p. 133), a man could earn
the hatred or gratitude of a tree-nymph by harming or saving her tree. According
to one tradition, Arkas, the hero who gave his name to Arcadia (see p. 542), fathered
his family by a hamadryad nymph whose tree he had once saved. For while he was
out hunting one day, the nymph Chrysopeleia appealed to him to save her tree,
which was in danger of being destroyed by a ﬂooding stream, and he diverted the
stream and secured the earth at the foot of the tree; and she therefore agreed to
enter into a union with him and to bear him his heirs.45 In another tale of the same
kind, a certain Rhoikos, a young man of Knidos on the west coast of Asia Minor, 
came across an oak-tree that was in danger of falling over and told his servants to
prop it up. The grateful tree-nymph, who had thus been saved from perishing 
along with her tree, offered him the choice of whatever he most desired, and he
asked to become her lover. Appointing a bee to act as their go-between, she granted
his request on condition that he should have nothing to do with other women. One
day, however, when the bee came to summon him while he was engaged in a game
of draughts, he responded brusquely to it, causing such anger to the nymph that
she turned him blind. Such at least is the story as it has come down to us; but one
may suspect that the bee would have informed her of some inﬁdelity in the orig-
inal version.46 And ﬁnally, Apollonius tells how a certain Paraibios (a friend of the
Thracian seer Phineus) brought a curse on himself and his children by ignoring the
tears and pleas of a hamadryad nymph when she begged him not to cut down 
her oak-tree.47
For a further example of how a nymph would react when crossed in love, we may
turn to the legend of the Sicilian herdsman Daphnis (who was himself the son of a
nymph in accounts that describe him as a son of Hermes). As he was tending his
ﬂocks in Sicily, a local nymph fell in love with him and took him as her lover, telling
him that he would lose his sight if he should ever be unfaithful to her; and when the
daughter of a local ruler subsequently took a fancy to him and plied him 
with wine to lure him into her bed, the angry nymph blinded him just as she had
warned. He found consolation for his misfortune in singing sorrowful songs, hence
the origin of pastoral verse.48 There were many versions of this story; according to
Ovid, for instance, the nymph turned him to stone; or else he was blinded as usual
but prayed for help to his father Hermes, who raised him up to heaven and caused a
spring to gush forth in his name at the place where he had vanished.49 In his fourth
Idyll, Theocritus offers a wholly different account in which Daphnis is said to have
boasted that he was more than a match for Eros, causing Aphrodite to afﬂict him

with an all-consuming passion that apparently caused his death.50 For other notable
legends in which nymphs were presented as falling in love with mortals, see 
pp. 385 and 444.
The Satyrs and Seilenoi
It is a peculiarity of ancient Greek folklore that female nature-spirits, whether of
land or sea, were imagined as being fully human in form while male nature-spirits
were imagined as having animal features. The principal male nature-spirits were the
SATYRS (Satyroi) and SEILENOI, lustful creatures of the wild who formed part of
the retinue of Dionysos, and diverted themselves with wine-drinking, music and
the pursuit of nymphs. As spirits of the wild life of the woods and hills, and partic-
ularly of their unrestrained and unguided fertility, they would have originated as
creations of the popular imagination, in much the same way as the nymphs; but
they became specialized in their role as attendants of Dionysos and had no place in
cult. The Satyrs and their counterparts the Seilenoi, who are not easily distinguished
from one another in earlier depictions at least, were consistently portrayed as quasi-
human, but as more or less grotesque in their build and features, always male, always
lustful and often visibly excited, and with some part of them deﬁnitely bestial. In
the earlier tradition, as in Attic vase-paintings of the sixth to ﬁfth century BC, Satyrs
are usually shown with horse’s tails and ears, and sometimes with legs resembling
the hind legs of horses. They also have distinctive snub-nosed facial features; the
traditional portrayal of Socrates shows him as looking much like a Satyr in that
respect. From the Hellenistic period onward, they often have something of the goat
about them, being shown with little horns, prick-ears, and often goat’s legs. This,
the type familiar from the famous Satyr of Praxiteles and other well-known 
works of art, clearly resembles Pan. In this later period, the Seilenoi are typically
distinguished from the Satyrs as being older (and also retaining their equine ears).
We sometimes hear of Papposeilenoi (i.e. daddy Seilenoi), and while the Satyrs are
often merry with wine, the Seilenoi are apt to be heavily drunk; a not uncommon
subject in art is a Satyr supporting a Seilenos who has drunk to excess. In Italy, the
Satyrs were identiﬁed with some native wood-spirits, the Fauni.
There is no mention of Satyrs or Seilenoi in Homer or the genuine works of
Hesiod. The earliest reference to Satyrs in the surviving literature can be found 
in a fragment from the Hesiodic Catalogue, which classes ‘the worthless good-
for-nothing Satyrs’ with the mountain-nymphs and Kouretes as children of the
daughters of Doros (see p. 219).51 The Seilenoi make their ﬁrst literary appearance
in the passage from the Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite quoted above, as lovers of the
mountain-nymphs. In the subsequent literature, and in artistic images too, the Satyrs
and Seilenoi are a disreputable and rather comical crowd who are fond of sex and
wine and dancing and revelry, and are usually utter cowards except in so far as the
Dionysiac frenzy lends them a measure of courage. At the Athenian dramatic festi-
vals of the classical period, each set of three tragedies would be followed by a comical
Satyr-play composed by the same author; the chorus consisted of a group of Satyrs
with Seilenos at their head, and the plot was a burlesque of a story from myth
(usually relating to the subject matter of the preceding trilogy). An idea of the
— Lesser deities and nature-spirits —
212

nature of this curious genre of literature can be gained from the extensive remains
of Sophocles’ Trackers (Ichneutai) and the surviving Cyclops of Euripides, in which
Seilenos and his Satyrs are introduced into the story of Odysseus and Polyphemos
(see p. 492).
The one Satyr who stands out from the mass as an individual with a story of his
own is Marsyas, who came to a bad end because he presumed to challenge Apollo 
to a musical contest (see p. 157). SEILENOS, the archetype or leader of the Seilenoi,
is represented as a swaggering Falstafﬁan ﬁgure in his role as leader of the chorus in
Satyr-plays, but also appears in more serious myth as the possessor of such wisdom 
as is to be found among beings of his kind. He was sometimes said to have acted as
tutor to the young Dionysos, and he is presented as quite a philosopher in a fragment
from Pindar that shows him preaching to the mythical ﬂautist Olympos (a son of
Marsyas and the eponym of Mt Olympos in Mysia) on the vanity of worldly wealth.52
His best-known story, which probably originated as a folk-tale, tells how Midas, king
of Phrygia, sought to beneﬁt from his wisdom. Taking advantage of Seilenos’ fond-
ness for wine, Midas ordered some servants to mix wine into his favourite spring in
Macedonia (or Phrygia), and to capture him and tie him up while he was incapaci-
tated by the liquor. When Midas questioned the captive nature-spirit, asking him
what is best and most desirable for human beings, he initially refused to say anything
at all; and when he was ﬁnally compelled to speak, he rebuked Midas for insisting
that he should be told what it was better for him not to know, namely that the best
fate for mortals is not to be born at all, and the next best to meet their death as early
as possible.53 Seilenos emerged into cult in a minor way, for Pausanias found a temple
in Elis that was dedicated to him (and to him alone, without Dionysos). Less impres-
sive was his memorial at Athens, a stone of no great size on the Acropolis, just big
enough for a small man to sit on, which had once served Seilenos as a seat when he
had visited Attica in the train of Dionysos.54

Another legend in which Seilenos appears in the company of Midas is the famous
tale of Midas’ golden touch. When Seilenos once became heavily drunk as he was
travelling through Phrygia in the train of Dionysos, some local peasants bound him
in chains of ﬂowers and took him to their king. Having been instructed in the
mysteries of Dionysos by Orpheus and Eumolpos, Midas knew something about the
god and recognized at once that this strange captive was a companion of his. 
So he entertained him liberally for ten days and nights, presumably making him
drunker than ever, and then restored him to his young master. Delighted to have
his tutor back again, Dionysos rewarded Midas by granting him a wish, and the
king asked that whatever he touched should be turned at once to gold. Although
initially entranced by his good fortune, Midas soon discovered that his new-found
powers brought unexpected difﬁculties, for his food and drink turned to gold before
he could consume them. When his thirst grew insupportable and he was threatened
with starvation, he prayed to Dionysos to relieve him from the sufferings that he
had incurred by his limitless greed, and the god ordered him to travel to the uplands
of Lydia to wash himself in the source of the river Pactolus. As soon as he did so,
his strange power passed from his body into the waters of the river, whose sands
and banks have gleamed with gold ever since.55
Other male nature-spirits who were imagined as being part-animal or wholly animal in form
were the river-gods and the Centaurs. If springs had nymphs as their presiding spirits, each
river had its god, who was usually pictured in the form of a bull, or of a bull with a human
head. River-gods were honoured in cult, and those of major rivers could be of some import-
ance in myth, either for their legends or as progenitors of early heroes or heroines; some of
the more notable river-gods have already been considered, as sons of Okeanos (see pp. 41–3).
Although the semi-equine Centaurs surely originated as creatures of folklore, as wild spirits
of the mountains and forests, they appear as beings of the mythical past alone in the recorded
tradition, and will therefore be considered in connection with heroic mythology. They were
associated with two areas in particular, the region of Mt Pelion in Thessaly, where they
became embroiled in a conﬂict with the neighbouring Lapiths (see p. 555), and north-western
Arcadia, where they provoked a ﬁght with Herakles (see p. 258). The sea harboured compar-
able beings of mixed form, such as the ﬁsh-tailed Tritons (see p. 106).
Pan and his loves
Very similar to the Satyrs in many respects was the rustic deity PAN, an Arcadian
god of shepherds and goatherds and their ﬂocks and herds. He was usually pictured
as being part-human in form and part-goat, with the horns, ears and legs of the lat-
ter; and he was goatish in character too, for he was lustful and sportive, a vigorous
and fertile nature-spirit who could also be short-tempered, especially if disturbed in
his noontide rest.56 A characteristic power of his which has left its mark on ancient
and modern speech is that of causing ‘panic’, a wild, groundless fear that strikes
groups of people and causes them to behave like frightened and stampeded animals.57
As a god of the wild uplands and of goatherds and shepherds, he especially liked to
haunt their summer pastures in the mountains. Like them, he would divert himself
with music by playing on the reed-pipe that is named after him and by singing and
dancing with the nymphs.58 It is therefore no wonder that he is prominent above all
— Lesser deities and nature-spirits —
214

in pastoral poetry, and that although his cult spread far beyond his native Arcadia, he
remained chieﬂy Arcadian. Of higher social and moral developments he knew noth-
ing, apart from the fancy of some theologians that his name meant ‘All’ (as pan can
mean in Greek) and that he could be viewed accordingly as a universal god.59 The
etymology itself is quite old, since Plato already plays with the thought, and the
Homeric Hymn to Pan explains that he was given this name by the gods because he
delighted the hearts of ‘all’ of them.60 A more plausible etymology would suggest 
that his name comes from the same root as Latin pa-sco and means ‘the Feeder’, i.e. the
pasturer of ﬂocks. From the ﬁfth century BC onwards, though the notion itself may
be more ancient, there is also mention of Pans (Panes, Paniskoi) as a generic group.
Although Pan was commonly regarded as a son of Hermes, accounts of his
parentage vary greatly, as is hardly surprising for a god of this kind who has no very
close relation to any of the great Olympians. According to the Homeric Hymn to Pan,
Hermes fathered him by the (unnamed) daughter of an Arcadian hero, Dryops; 
and when he was born with goat’s feet, two horns and a full beard, his nurse was so
shocked that she ran off and deserted him; but Hermes was delighted with his
uncouth son, and carried him up to Olympos wrapped in the skins of mountain 
hares to show him off to the other gods.61 In later sources, Hermes is often said to
have fathered him by a most improbable mother, none other than Penelope, the
faithful wife of Odysseus; indeed, Herodotus describes this as the common view of

the Greeks.62 The whole idea is so odd that it is tempting to suppose that this
Penelope was not originally the wife of Odysseus, but an entirely different ﬁgure,
perhaps an Arcadian nymph or the above-mentioned daughter of Dryops. If she did
not bear Pan to Hermes, Penelope bore him to Apollo, or to her husband, or to 
one of her suitors or indeed all of them (a bizarre idea which was apparently 
inspired by the fact that the god’s name can mean ‘all’).63 Among other fancies, we
ﬁnd the suggestion that Zeus fathered him on Hybris (i.e. Wantonness) or that a
shepherd called Krathis fathered him by one of his goats;64 but that is quite enough
on this matter.
Pan was forever pursuing the nymphs of the countryside, much like the Satyrs
(although he did not share their other vice of heavy drinking, which was developed
as a result of their association with Dionysos). He appears accordingly in various
love-stories, in which he usually meets with nothing but frustration; the previously
mentioned tale of his seduction of the moon-goddess Selene (see p. 46) is some-
thing of an exception. The picturesque story of SYRINX (Pan-pipes) explains the
origin of his favourite musical instrument. Syrinx was a beautiful hamadryad nymph
who rejected the approaches of the Satyrs and other nature-spirits, preferring to live
as a virgin huntress. On catching sight of her one day, Pan conceived a passionate
desire for her; and when he found that she would have nothing to do with him, he
chased her through the countryside until she arrived at the river Ladon, where she
prayed to the nymph of the stream (or to Earth) to save her, and was instantly trans-
formed into a clump of reeds. So when Pan arrived at the spot and tried to seize
her, he found that he was clasping nothing more than an armful of reeds. On hearing
the wind blowing through the reed-bed, he was strangely moved by the desolate
sound, and proceeded to create the ﬁrst Pan-pipes (syrinx) by cutting some reeds of
unequal length and joining them together with wax. Or in a rationalistic version,
Syrinx was no more than a rustic maiden, and she merely vanished from view among
the reeds as she plunged into them.65
Pan could be associated with pine-trees as a god of the high hills, and it was said
that he liked to crown himself with pine-wreaths. It is therefore no surprise to hear
that he should have fallen in love with a nymph called PITYS (Pine), a ﬁgure who
is ﬁrst mentioned in Theocritus’ Syrinx. As in the case of Syrinx, his love was not
reciprocated, and Pitys was turned into a pine-tree as she ﬂed. In another version,
Boreas (the North Wind) competed with Pan for her love, and was so angry when
she preferred Pan that he killed her by blowing her over a cliff; but Earth took pity
on her and transformed her into a pine-tree. Pines have made a mournful sound
ever since whenever the North Wind blows through them.66 This latter version was
evidently inspired by the tale in which Apollo and Boreas were said to have competed
for the love of Hyakinthos (see p. 155), just as the former version was inspired by
the myth of Apollo and Daphne (see p. 155).
Pan fared no better when he fell in love with another nymph, ECHO, since she
spurned him in favour of a Satyr. The outcome was more tragic on this occasion,
for on ﬁnding that he could neither win her over nor run her down, he sent 
some shepherds mad, causing them to tear her to pieces so that only her voice
survived.67

Ovid offers a different version of Echo’s story. To save her fellow nymphs from being caught
by Hera while they were dallying with Zeus in the mountains, Echo used to distract her
with a constant ﬂow of talk until they could escape. When Hera came to realize that she
had been tricked, she curtailed Echo’s powers of speech, declaring that the nymph would
no longer be able to express any thought of her own, but merely to repeat the last words
that she heard from others. While subject to this handicap, she fell in love with a youth
called Narkissos (Narcissus in Latin form), a son of the river-god Kephisos by the nymph
Leiriope. She followed him around in secret and ﬁnally contrived a meeting, but he repelled
her when she tried to embrace him, for he was cold by nature, and she lived all alone in
the woods from that time onwards. As she pined for her love, she gradually wasted away
until nothing was left apart from her bones and her voice; and when her bones turned to
stone, she was nothing more than an answering voice.
After Narkissos had rejected many admirers in this way, male and female alike, one 
of them prayed that he should suffer an unrequited passion on his own part. So one day, as 
he was leaning over a woodland pool to drink, he fell in love with his own reﬂection and
remained forever at that spot, unable to tear himself away, until he died from exhaustion 
and unsatisﬁed desire. His hopeless passion was witnessed by Echo, who re-echoed his sighs
and laments. Even in the Underworld, so Ovid tells us, he continues to stare at his reﬂection
in the Styx. He was mourned by the woodland nymphs in the world above, but when his body
was due to be cremated, it was nowhere to be seen, and a narcissus-ﬂower was found to have
grown up in place of it.68 Other sources state that the ﬂower sprang from his blood or that
he was transformed into it.69 Pausanias records a rationalized version of this story, saying 
that he had a twin sister of almost identical appearance, and that he tried to relieve his sorrow
after she died by staring at his own reﬂection and imagining that it was her.70
Perhaps the most famous exploit of Pan was the help that he brought to the
Athenians at the battle of Marathon (490 BC), by inducing fear in the Persian
invaders. On the eve of the great struggle, the Athenians sent the runner Philippides
(sometimes wrongly named as Pheidippides) to ask help from the Spartans, who
were unable to respond in time because their laws prevented them from marching
out before the full moon. Philippides was able to report, however, that he had been
accosted by Pan as he was passing through Arcadia, and that the god had told him
to ‘take a message to the Athenians, asking them why they did not pay him any
respect, seeing that he was their friend and had often helped them before, and would
do so again’. So after Pan kept his promise by helping them in the battle, they
founded a cult to him, with a shrine under the brow of the Acropolis.71
Stranger still is a later story that tells of the death of Pan. In the days of Tiberius,
a ship that was sailing from Italy to Greece was becalmed near the islands of 
Paxos and Propaxos off north-western Greece. Suddenly a voice from the shore 
cried ‘Thamuz!’. This was the name of the ship’s pilot, an Egyptian, who made 
no reply at ﬁrst but ﬁnally answered when summoned in this way for the third time.
The voice then told him, ‘When you draw opposite Palodes, tell them that great Pan
is dead.’ After some discussion, Thamuz decided that he would sail past without
saying anything if a breeze blew up, but would obey the voice if the calm persisted.
When they drifted near Palodes in the continuing calm, he shouted out, ‘Great Pan
is dead!’, and was answered by innumerable voices crying out all at once in lamenta-
tion and amazement. It has been suggested that the sounds from the shore may have

been ritual laments for Thamuz-Adonis; in that case, the cry ‘Thamuz the all-great
(pammegas) is dead’ could have been misinterpreted as referring to great Pan (Pan
megas). It is quite possible on the other hand that the story is simply a ﬁction.72
Attis and Kybele; the Kouretes and Korybantes
Just on the frontiers of classical belief and cult was the great Asiatic goddess KYBELE
(or Kybebe), with her cult-partner ATTIS. According to the cultic legend from
Pessinous, a main centre of her cult in Galatia (a central province of Asia Minor), 
she acquired her partner in the following circumstances. Agdistis, a doublet of
Kybele, sprang up from the ground in that region after Zeus shed some semen on to
it in his sleep (or as he was vainly attempting to make love to Kybele). Although the
new-born being had both male and female genital organs, the gods (or Dionysos
speciﬁcally) cut off its male organs to turn it into a female; and an almond-tree 
of marvellous beauty grew up from them with its nuts already ripe. When Nana, 
a daughter of the local river Sangarios, placed some of these nuts (or a blossom from
the tree) inside her dress, they (or the blossom) disappeared and she found that she
was pregnant with a child. She exposed the child at birth, but a he-goat somehow
contrived to attend to him, and he survived to grow up into a wonderfully handsome
youth called Attis (or Attes). Agdistis fell in love with him and grew frantically
jealous when he was due to marry the daughter of the king of Pessinous. So she
appeared at his wedding and drove him mad, and he cut off his genitals in his frenzy
with fatal effect. The goddess was overcome by remorse afterwards, and persuaded
Zeus to grant that the body of Attis should never decay, and that his little ﬁnger
should continue to move and his hair to grow. This extraordinary tale purported to
explain, among other things, why the priests of Kybele were eunuchs.73
In another version of the story of Attis, Kybele fell in love with him after seeing him by
the river Gallos in Phrygia, and installed him as her temple-servant, warning him that 
he should remain chaste and always be faithful to her; but he abandoned her after falling
in love with a tree-nymph called Sagaritis, and the angry goddess drove him mad, causing
him to cut off his genitals.74 Or in a rationalized version, Kybele was a Phrygian priestess
who was exposed at birth by her father, but survived and later engaged in a secret love affair
with a local youth called Attis, becoming pregnant as a consequence. Her parents recalled
her to their home at this time, under the belief that she was still a virgin; but her father
came to learn of her seduction, and killed Attis along with his nurses and cast them out
unburied. Kybele went mad in her grief and roamed through the countryside in a frenzied
state, beating on a kettle-drum (tympanon, as in the rites of the goddess). And at some later
time, when the Phrygians were struck by a plague and famine, they received an oracle
ordering them to bury Attis and to honour Kybele as a goddess. Since the youth’s body had
disappeared by this time, they fashioned an image of him and performed propitiatory rites,
hence the origin of his cult.75
Both in cult and in legend, Kybele was frequently identiﬁed with Rhea (see p. 71);
and for that reason, her attendants, the Korybantes, were frequently confused with
the Kouretes, who, as already mentioned, attended the infant Zeus. Although these
two groups of young male ﬁgures were certainly alike in many ways, it will be well
— Lesser deities and nature-spirits —
218

to disentangle their traditions. The KOURETES (Kouretai) ﬁrst appear in a rather
surprising context, in a fragment from the Hesiodic Catalogue already mentioned in
connection with the Satyrs, in which the Satyrs, the mountain-nymphs and ‘the
divine Kouretes, playful dancers’ are all described as sharing a common origin, appar-
ently as children of the daughters of Doros.76 For this author then, as usually in
later belief, they are superhuman beings of a lower order than the gods. They were
famous in myth as the Cretan daimones who drowned out the cries of the infant
Zeus by performing noisy war-dances in front of the cave where he was hidden (see
p. 75). Although Callimachus in the Hellenistic era is the ﬁrst author to make
explicit mention of this story, Euripides seems to allude to it in the Bacchae, and
it was presumably quite ancient.77 As beings who were proverbial for their prophetic
powers, they also appear in a tale from heroic mythology in which they advise Minos,
king of Crete, on how to ﬁnd his lost son Glaukos (see p. 353). Apollodorus 
records a curious tale in which Zeus is said to have killed them for abducting his
son Epaphos from Egypt (see p. 232); but since they are presumably standing in
for a group of foreign divinities, this cannot be regarded as part of their conven-
tional mythology. The name of the Kouretes simply means young men or young
warriors, and it has long been suspected that their main story is a mythical reﬂec-
tion of annual rites in which choruses of Cretan youths would perform ritual dances
in honour of Zeus probably to promote fertility. In the hymn to Zeus from
Palaikastro in Crete, which probably dates to the fourth century BC, such a chorus
invites the son of Kronos with music and song (and by implication, dances too) to
return to his birthplace of Dikte for the coming year, and to ‘leap’ to bring fertility
to the island’s animals and crops, and also bring beneﬁt to its cities and ships, and
so on. It is signiﬁcant that Zeus should be invoked in this poem as the great Kouros
who had once stepped out at the head of his daimones (i.e. the Kouretes, whose
mythical dance is now imitated by the young men of the chorus).78
The KORYBANTES (Whirlers?), so far as the jumbled condition of our evidence
(mostly from late sources) enables us to distinguish them from the Kouretes at all,
were Asianic rather than Cretan, as daimones who attended on Kybele the Anatolian
goddess. There were so many conﬂicting speculations about their parentage that it
is hard to ﬁnd any two authorities in agreement; they are most often described as
sons of Rhea or Apollo by one parent or another, or as sons of a certain Korybas
(who was himself a son of Kybele or a fatherless son of Kore).79 They are constantly
associated with ritual dancing, and with mysteries and magical cures; it would seem
that the latter were taught only to women. Plato makes several interesting allusions
to the Korybantic rites, above all in a passage in the Laws in which he explains
how they provided a cure for mental disturbances;80 the cure was homeopathic in
character, for it was supposed that the patients could recover their mental equilib-
rium if their human madness could be displaced by divine madness induced by
ecstatic music and dancing. The Korybantes have no proper myths except in so far
as they came to be identiﬁed with the Kouretes (as was doubtless inevitable after
Kybele came to be identiﬁed with Rhea). Euripides already mentions them along
with the Kouretes (who are perhaps to be regarded as the same here) in connection
with the infancy of Zeus, stating that they invented Rhea’s drum at that time,
evidently to be beaten while the dances were performed for the protection of Zeus.81

Some groups of minor divinities associated with 
the Greek islands
The KABEIROI were more important, even if the Greek world was hardly
acquainted with them until the time of Athenian greatness. They were worshipped
primarily in the northern Aegean region, especially on Lemnos, but also had notable
Boeotian cults at Thebes and at Anthedon on the eastern coast. Their name is of
uncertain meaning and origin; although it has long been argued that it may have
been derived from a Semitic word, qabir, meaning mighty (which accords very 
well with their Greek titles as the theoi megaloi or dunatai, the great or mighty gods),
there is nothing provably Semitic about their ritual or the history of their cult. It
may perhaps have originated in Asia Minor. Be that as it may, they presided over
an ancient mystery-cult whose content and rituals are largely unrecorded. They were
often identiﬁed with another group of gods who presided over a mystery-cult in the
northern Aegean, the GODS OF SAMOTHRACE (who were left unnamed in
connection with their cult). These latter gods were supposed to protect initiates
from all manner of dangers, especially those of the sea. Their effectiveness in this
regard was attested by the many votive offerings that were set up at Samothrace by
seafarers who had escaped disaster (although Diogenes observed that there would
have been many more of them if they were also set up by the people who were 
not saved82). In myth, the Argonauts were initiated at Samothrace before sailing into
unknown waters (see p. 384); and in historical times, the Samothracian mysteries
became widely favoured during the Hellenistic and Roman periods, coming to be
regarded as second only to those at Eleusis. There is no indication that the
Samothracian mysteries and those of the Kabeiroi provided initiates with better
expectations for the afterlife as did those at Eleusis.
It is no surprise that the mythology of beings such as the Kabeiroi should be
inconsistent. There are three Kabeiroi in the earliest literary accounts; according 
to Pherecydes, they were born to Hephaistos by Kabeiro, daughter of Proteus 
(an old man of the sea), along with three sisters, while Acusilaus prefers to believe
that they were the sons of a certain Kamillos who was himself a son of Hephaistos
and Kabeiro.83 It is understandable that they should have been connected with
Hephaistos since he had a special association with Lemnos (see pp. 164–5), which 
was a main centre of their cult. In their cultic legend at Thebes, there were appar-
ently only two of them, a young one and an old one.84 Or else there were four 
of them, three male and one female, named Axieros, Kasmilos, Axiokersos and
Axiokersa.85
Other strange groups of daimones who were associated with the Greek islands
were the Dactyls (Fingers) and Telchines, who were pictured as smiths and sorcerers.
Although the surviving record with regard to the IDAIAN DAKTYLOI is complex,
inconsistent and fragmentary, it seems to have been generally agreed that they were
blacksmith-magicians who were somehow connected with Rhea. As that goddess
was about to give birth to Zeus on Mt Ida in Crete, she clutched the ground with
her hands, and the mountain instantly brought the Daktyloi to birth, one for each
of her ﬁngers;86 or when she brought Zeus to birth in the Diktaian cave in Crete,
an attendant nymph, Anchiale, strewed some dust behind her, and the Daktyloi 
— Lesser deities and nature-spirits —
220

sprang up from it.87 Since Rhea came to be identiﬁed with Kybele, the birth of the
Daktyloi was sometimes placed in Kybele’s homeland in Asia Minor, on Mt Ida in
the Troad. Although it would be logical for there to be ten Daktyloi as in the
preceding story, their numbers vary to an eccentric degree. There were ﬁve or six
male Daktyloi who acted as metal-workers, on their own or with the help of their
ﬁve sisters;88 or there were a hundred overall, or twenty-six; or in an account ascribed
to Pherecydes, there were thirty-two left-hand Daktyloi, who acted as sorcerers, and
twenty right-hand Daktyloi who worked counter-magic.89 Or according to a frag-
ment from an early epic called the Phoronis, there were three Daktyloi named Akmon
(Anvil), Damnameneus (effectively Hammer) and Kelmis (Smelter?) who ﬁrst discov-
ered the art of metal-working.90 It was also said that the art was taught to them
by Rhea.91 Ovid mentions in passing that Kelmis was once a friend of the infant
Zeus but was later turned into adamant (a mythical metal); and it is reported else-
where that he suffered this fate because he behaved insolently towards Mother
Rhea.92 Some claimed that the Herakles who founded the Olympian Games was not
the well-known hero but a dwarﬁsh Dactyl of the same name.93 These scraps are
just enough to tantalize the researcher, and give an idea of what a world of folk-
lore was contained in the mass of Greek literature now lost to us.
The TELCHINES were generally thought to have been primordial inhabitants of
Rhodes, although they were also associated with other places such as Cyprus, Ceos
and Sicyon. According to Diodorus, they lived at Rhodes until the great ﬂood 
caused them the scatter in the age of Deukalion. Looking back from the Byzantine
era, the lexicon of the Souda is uncertain whether they were malicious daimones 
or malicious men who had the evil eye.94 The former interpretation is of course 
the correct one; some have compared them to the gnomes and Kobolds of northern
European folklore. They were skilled in many arts, especially those of metal-working,
which was indeed discovered by them according to some accounts; it was said that
they fashioned the ﬁrst statues of the gods.95 Some traced their activities back to
the very earliest times, claiming that they forged Poseidon’s trident (a deed also
ascribed to the Kyklopes, see p. 69) or even the sickle of Kronos.96 They were so
clever as magicians that they could alter their form and change the weather at will.97
They were also proverbial for their malice, and were said to have sprinkled Rhodes
with water from the Styx (an infernal river, see p. 109) to render it infertile.98 It
was often said that Zeus or some other god ﬁnally killed them on account of their
malice and presumption.99 According to a Rhodian tradition, Rhea entrusted the
infant Poseidon to the Telchines and the Okeanid Kapheiro to be reared by them
on Rhodes.100
Glaukos, Priapos and Hymenaios
GLAUKOS (Sea-Green; sometimes distinguished as Glaukos Pontios, ‘of the sea’)
was a minor sea-god who had originated as a mortal. Before eating some magical
grass which had rendered him immortal, he had been a humble ﬁsherman who had
lived at Anthedon on the Boeotian coast. One day, as he was sorting his catch, he
had noticed that the ﬁsh from his nets and lines revived if he laid them down on
a particular patch of grass; and when he plucked and chewed some of the grass

to test its properties, he was immediately transformed into a ﬁsh-tailed sea-god with
a green beard and body.101 Although Aeschylus wrote a play about Glaukos, only
a few scattered fragments survive, one of them telling how he was transformed after
eating the ‘immortal, everlasting grass’. Aeschylus located the incident in northern
Euboea.102 He was gifted with prophetic powers, as was so often the case with sea-
deities, and rose up from the waves (so Apollonius recounts, see p. 383) to advise
the Argonauts after they had been accidentally abandoned by two of their ship-
mates.103 In Euripides’ Orestes, he is said to have appeared to Menelaos off Cape
Malea to inform him of the murder of Agamemnon104 (so taking over, in part at
least, the function that is performed by Proteus in the Odyssey, see p. 484). For
Ovid’s story of his frustrated love for Skylla, see p. 497.
Although the cult of PRIAPOS arrived rather late in Greece, hardly spreading
beyond its area of origin by the Hellespont until the end of the fourth century BC,
it eventually became widely familiar and spread to Italy too. A preposterous little
god who was represented as a more or less grotesquely misshapen man with an erect
phallus of disproportionate size, he never seems to have been regarded as a very
serious deity outside his original homeland. He watched over ﬂocks, herds and bees,
and brought help to herdsmen and ﬁshermen; in later times, he was viewed above
all as a guardian of vineyards, orchards and gardens, part scarecrow, part warning
to human thieves, part luck-bringer; and in his capacity as a luck-bringer, he was
often to be found at the doors of houses. Elegantly obscene Priapic verses were
composed in his honour in both Greek and Latin. Such is the Priapos who is most
familiar to us from his later career. In his region of origin, however, at Lampsakos
and the surrounding area on the Asian shore of the Hellespont, he was a fertility-
god of the ﬁrst importance who was honoured on a level with the Olympian gods.
Donkeys were sacriﬁced to him at Lampsakos, doubtless because they were credited
with a lustful nature and exceptional progenitive powers.
The myths of Priapos are late and artiﬁcial; some are birth-legends from his native Helles-
pontine region while others are tales that link him to his special animal, the donkey. He
came to be described as a son of Dionysos and Aphrodite, as is understandable since he was
associated with abandonment and sex; or perhaps Aphrodite conceived him to her favourite
Adonis while Dionysos was away on his campaign in India. According to a local legend 
which sets his birth in Aparnis (later Abarnis) near Lampsakos, the jealous Hera touched 
the body of his pregnant mother to cause him to be born deformed, and Aphrodite was so
horriﬁed when she gave birth to a misshapen son with outsized genitals that she renounced
him (aparneito, hence the name of Aparnis), abandoning him to be reared by shepherds.105
This story was probably inspired by the similar story that was told about the birth of 
Pan (see p. 215).
Ovid recounts no less than three stories in which Priapos is frustrated by the untimely
braying of a donkey as he is about to attempt a rape. According to one such tale in the Fasti,
he crept up on the nymph Lotis while she was lying asleep in the open air after a feast of the
gods; but at the critical moment, the ass of Seilenos brayed aloud, causing the nymph to awake
with a start and Priapos to be exposed to general ridicule. He was so angry that he killed the
donkey and welcomed sacriﬁces of donkeys ever afterwards.106 Later in the same poem, 
Ovid tells the same story about Vesta (the Roman equivalent of Hestia see p. 139) to explain
why donkeys were rested and garlanded on her feast-day at Rome.107 Although there is no
record of the preceding version in surviving Greek sources, it is reasonable to assume that it
— Lesser deities and nature-spirits —
222

originated in Greece as a cultic aetiology, and that Ovid adapted it to provide a mythical
explanation for this purely Roman practice associated with the Vestalia. He would doubtless
have excluded one of the versions if he had lived to complete the Fasti. This is not quite the
end of the matter since Ovid offers a different account of Priapos’ attempted rape of Lotis in
the Metamorphoses, stating that she was turned into a lotus-tree (presumably in response to a
prayer of her own) as she was ﬂeeing from him.108 This story is evidently modelled on the
famous transformation myth in which Daphne was turned into a laurel-tree (daphne¯) as she
was ﬂeeing from Apollo (see p. 155). Ovid probably invented it to accord with the general
theme of the poem (although it is of course possible that this was the original Greek version
of the story of the attempted rape).
According to another donkey-story, Dionysos once came up against an impassable swamp
as he was travelling to his father’s oracle at Dodona to seek a cure for a ﬁt of madness that
had been inﬂicted on him by Hera. He found a way across, however, by riding through the
marshes on a donkey that he encountered there; and after achieving his cure at Dodona, he
rewarded the beast by granting it the power of human speech. It used its new-found powers
to challenge Priapos to a contest over the size of their genital organs; but the god proved
to be better-endowed and killed the beast to punish it for its impertinence.109 This story is
preserved in the astral myth that was devised to explain the origin of the two stars in the
constellation Cancer that were (and still are) known as the Asses, or Aselli in Latin. Since
there were two such stars, complications were introduced into the tale when it was adapted
into a star-myth, but these need not concern us here.
To pass on to a more respectable god, HYMENAIOS was the deity who presided
over weddings. His name was derived from the traditional wedding-cry of Hymen
of Hymenaie (or the like), which could be interpreted as an invocation to a deity
called Hymenaios (or Hymen). He was commonly pictured as a handsome young
man, tall and rather epicene, carrying a bridal torch and wreath as his attributes. 
It is understandable that he should usually be classed as a son of one or other of 
the Muses,110 since these were the deities who led the wedding-song (hymenaios) 
at marriages of the gods; or else he is described in some Latin sources as a son of
Dionysos by Aphrodite or some unnamed mother.111 Or else he had been a ﬁne
singer of mortal birth who had died on his wedding-day, or before his proper time,
or as he was singing at the wedding-feast of Dionysos.112 Or in a fully rational-
ized account, he was an ordinary Athenian when had died long ago and had come
to be commemorated in the wedding-song as a result of the following course 
of events.
Though exceptionally handsome (so this story relates), Hymenaios was of modest
birth, and when he fell in love with an Athenian girl of noble family, all he could
do was follow her around to admire her at a distance. One day, as she and her
friends were participating in the rites of Demeter at Eleusis, they were snatched
away by some pirates, who also seized Hymenaios because he had been trailing his
beloved. After the voyage, however, he managed to kill the pirates in their sleep,
and made his way back to Athens on his own. On his arrival, he told the citizens
about the fate of their missing daughters, and offered to fetch them back again if
he were allowed to marry the one whom he loved. So he fulﬁlled his pledge and
married her; and since the marriage proved to be exceptionally happy, it became
the custom to invoke his name at weddings.113 There is mention of a tradition in
which an evidently mortal Hymenaios was restored to life by Asklepios, though

nothing is recorded of the circumstances;114 and some said that he was loved by
Apollo, or Hesperos (the Evening Star), or Thamyris, or an obscure hero called
Argynnos.115 Argos is the only place that is ever mentioned as having a cult of
Hymenaios.116
We may pass over, as not germane to a book of this kind, some legends of foreign
deities which had no very wide currency among the Greeks, such as that of Isis,
which in its late form, as known to Plutarch,117 had patently been inﬂuenced by
the story of Demeter. Deserving of passing mention, however, by way of a post-
script, are two curiosities from Latin sources. Roman authors from Ovid onwards
sometimes refer to the maiden in the sky – the constellation Virgo – as ASTRAIA
(the Starry Woman), and state that she had abandoned the earth because she had
been so appalled by human wickedness.118 Although there is no indication that this
name was ever applied to her in Greek literature, the tale of her departure origi-
nated in an allegorical star-legend recounted by the Hellenistic poet Aratus, who
wrote a well-known didactic poem on the phenomena of the heavens. Aratus tells
how the star-maiden (here simply called Parthenos, the Maiden, the Greek equiva-
lent of Virgo) had lived among human beings under the name of Dike (Justice) in
the time of the golden race (see p. 224), but had withdrawn to the hills when morals
had declined in the time of the silver race, now satisfying herself with reproaching
human wickedness from a distance, and ﬁnally, in horror at the violence and injus-
tice of the bronze race, had ﬂed to the heavens, where her ﬁgure may still be seen
as a silent reproach.119 The idea that she could be called Astraia was evidently
prompted by a remark at the beginning of the relevant section of Aratus’ poem, in
which he suggests that she may have been a daughter of Astraios120 (who was the
father of all the stars in Hesiod’s Theogony, see p. 48). And lastly, something should
be said of DEMOGORGON, whose ‘dread name’ appealed to the imagination of
Spenser, Milton and, above all, Shelley. It is rather a shame that such a ﬁne-sounding
deity should be no more than a ﬁgment that was created by a copyist’s blunder. In
his Latin epic on the Theban War, Statius makes his Teiresias mention with awe
‘the most High One of the triple universe, whom it is not lawful to know’;121 and
an ancient commentator reports in a note on this passage, as presently preserved,
that the poet meant Demogorgon.122 But since there is no sign of this improbable
name in any other ancient source, it is now agreed that the note originally referred
to Demiurgus, the Demiurge or Creator-god.

THE EARLY HISTORY 
OF THE INACHIDS

T
he ﬁrst four chapters of our survey of heroic mythology will be devoted to the
Inachid family, which ruled in Argos, Thebes and Crete and produced the
greatest of all Greek heroes, Herakles. Since it was supposed that most of the main
heroes and heroines of legend would have belonged to the royal family of their native
area, the mythical history of each city and land was in all essentials the history of
its ruling family, as organized on a genealogical basis. Once a consistent account
had been developed of the succession within each kingdom, all the mythical ﬁgures
and legendary events associated with that area could be assigned to a speciﬁc point
in time in relation to the reigns of the various kings; and since the heroes and hero-
ines of each kingdom often interacted with those of others, through wars and
marriages, for instance, or participation in joint adventures, it was necessary that
the genealogies of the separate royal families should be synchronized with one
another (even if this was not always perfectly achieved, see e.g. p. 337). On this
basis, a remarkably coherent pseudo-history came to be developed for much of
legendary Greece. The process was initiated in epic, most notably in the Catalogue
of Women (a genealogical poem of the early sixth century BC traditionally ascribed
to Hesiod, see pp. 10–12), and was brought to a high degree of development there-
after by early prose mythographers such as Pherecydes and Hellanicus (see pp. 
9 and 15). According to the simplest pattern, a single ruling family would provide
the ruling line in a single centre, as in the case of the royal families of Athens and
Arcadia, which were both descended from indigenous earthborn ancestors. In general,
however, the heroic genealogies tended to be more sophisticated and economical
than this, since the mythographers liked to unite different ruling lines within a
single family by tracing them back to common ancestors. The present family of the
Inachids offers a striking example of this, as does that of the Atlantids, in which
the family of Helen at Sparta is drawn into the same genealogical system as that of
her abductor Paris at Troy.
As may be appreciated from this, nothing could be less true of Greek heroic
legend than to suppose that it tells of events that were situated in some vague and
indeterminate mythical antiquity. Most signiﬁcant heroes and heroines and their
adventures could be dated to a speciﬁc point in time within the heroic era, and the
heroic era itself could be placed in a datable relation to the era of conventional

CHAPTER SEVEN

history, which was supposed to have begun in the generations immediately following
the Trojan War. This mightiest of wars, in which leading heroes from all parts of
Greece were said to have joined together in a common enterprise of unparalleled
magnitude, was the culminating event of the heroic era, and a relatively short span
of time was thought to have elapsed – usually no more than six or seven genera-
tions or so – between the time of origin of the various Greek royal lines and the
outbreak of the war. The three other great panhellenic enterprises, the voyage of
the Argonauts, the hunt for the Calydonian boar, and the Theban Wars, were
supposed to have taken place in the generation preceding the Trojan War. We will
begin with two great heroic families that were only marginally connected with the
Trojan War, the Inachids and Deukalionids, and then consider the war itself before
passing on to the families that were most closely connected with it. The three
panhellenic adventures that preceded it will be discussed in relation to the ﬁrst two
families, as will the lives of Herakles and Theseus.
The Inachid family was descended from Inachos, the god of the greatest river of
the Argolid, and was thus of Argive origin; but although Argos was long a main
centre of Inachid rule, Inachid dynasties of comparable importance came to be estab-
lished in Thebes and Crete as a result of the following course of events. An early
Argive princess, Io, wandered off to Egypt for reasons that will be explained shortly
and married the king of the land, who bequeathed his throne to a son whom she
had borne to Zeus. This son of hers, Epaphos, was succeeded by one of his two
grandsons, Belos, while his other grandson Agenor, the twin brother of Belos, went
away to found a kingdom of his own in Phoenicia. Since descendants of Belos would
come to rule in their ancestral homeland in Argos while two children of Agenor
would found new Inachid lines in Thebes and Crete, Belos and Agenor were destined
to become the ancestors of separate branches of the family within the Greek world.
To start with the latter, Agenor had a beautiful daughter Europa who was removed
to Crete at the will of Zeus, where she bore him three sons including Minos, the
island’s greatest mythical ruler; and when Agenor sent his sons in search of her,
they all failed to ﬁnd her and settled abroad as a consequence, including Kadmos,
who founded the great city of Thebes in Central Greece at the bidding of the Delphic
oracle. Belos for his part had two sons, Aigyptos and Danaos, who ruled in
adjoining kingdoms and fathered a great many children, Aigyptos ﬁfty sons and
Danaos ﬁfty daughters. Aigyptos was eager to marry his sons to his nieces and put
pressure on his brother to agree, but Danaos was unwilling to see his family absorbed
into that of his brother and tried to escape that predicament by ﬂeeing to Argos
with his daughters, the Danaids.
When the sons of Aigyptos subsequently arrived in pursuit, Danaos adopted a
more ruthless stratagem by pretending to agree to the marriages but ordering his
daughters to kill their husbands on their wedding night. He was disobeyed, however,
by one of his daughters, Hypermnestra, who spared her husband Lynkeus and
helped him to safety. Danaos, who had established himself as king of Argos, even-
tually consented to their marriage and was succeeded by their son Abas, who was
succeeded in his turn by his twin sons Proitos and Akrisios. The twins had fought
one another even in their mother’s womb and now embarked on a war that resulted
in the partition of the kingdom. The Argolid would not be reunited into a single
— The early history of the Inachids —
226

kingdom until well after the Trojan War. The two foremost heroes in the family,
Perseus and Herakles, were both descended from Akrisios, who ruled his half of the
land from the city of Argos. After being warned by an oracle that his daughter
would bear a son who would kill him, Akrisios tried to avert the danger by enclosing 
his daughter Danae in an underground chamber, but Zeus slipped through the roof
in the form of a shower of gold and caused her to conceive the mighty Perseus. 
On learning of his birth, Akrisios enclosed him in a chest along with his mother
and set it adrift in the sea. He and his mother were carried unharmed, however, to
the rocky Aegean island of Seriphos, where they were offered shelter by a brother
of the king. After growing up on the island and establishing his heroic credentials 
by fetching the head of the Gorgon Medusa and rescuing his prospective bride,
Andromeda, from a sea-monster, Perseus sailed back to Argos to seek a reconcili-
ation with his grandfather; but he came to kill him just as the oracle had predicted
as the result of a tragic accident. After exchanging his grandfather’s kingdom for
that of Megapenthes, the son of his great-uncle Proitos, Perseus ruled in the Argolid
thereafter, founding the stronghold of Mycenae as his seat of rule. The affairs of his
immediate descendants are primarily of interest in relation to the origin of the most
distinguished of them, Herakles, a great-grandson of his who came to be born in
exile at Thebes.
The history of the early Inachids in Argos and Egypt, as summarized in the
preceding paragraphs, will form the subject of the present chapter. Since Herakles
spent most of his life outside his ancestral land and his mythology is so exception-
ally rich, taking him to many different areas, his career will be examined separately
in the next chapter along with the history of his descendants, the Heraklids. As for
the other main branches of the family that were descended from Agenor, king of
Phoenicia, the Kadmeian ruling line at Thebes will be considered in Chapter 9 and
Europa’s descendants in Crete in Chapter 10.
Phoroneus, the ﬁrst ruler of Argos, and his immediate 
descendants
The ﬁrst man of Argos, and perhaps the ﬁrst man of all, was PHORONEUS, who
was fathered by Inachos on an Okeanid nymph called Melia or Argia.1 He was
described as the ﬁrst of mortal men in the Phoronis,2 an archaic epic that would have
recorded the local traditions about Phoroneus and the ancient history of the Argolid.
He was more a culture-hero, however, than an epic hero in the conventional sense,
as the primordial ruler of Argos who was supposed to have introduced the ﬁrst
elements of civilization and to have established the main cults of the land. In that
respect, he may be compared to Pelasgos in Arcadia (see p. 537) or Kekrops at
Athens (see p. 364). Just as Athens was noted for its association with Athena, Argos
was marked out from other lands by its special association with Hera, who had been
the great goddess of Argos from time immemorial, or, in mythical terms, ever since
the reign of its ﬁrst king. As in the case of Athena at Athens, Hera was said to
have established her position as patron deity by defeating Poseidon in a contest for
the land. Phoroneus was appointed as arbitrator, and he chose in favour of Hera
after consulting with his father Inachos and two other river-gods of the area,

Kephisos and Asterion. Poseidon was so angry that he reduced most of the land to
aridity by causing its rivers to run dry for much of the year, so turning it into the
‘thirsty Argos’ of proverb.3 After inviting Hera into Argos in this way, Phoroneus
established her cult by honouring her with the ﬁrst sacriﬁces ever offered to her.4
In his function as ruler, he gathered his people (one should not enquire too anxiously
about their origin) into the ﬁrst settled community, the ‘town of Phoroneus’, astu
Phoronikon, which would later develop into the great city of Argos.5 The Argives
went so far as to claim that Phoroneus (rather than Prometheus) had ﬁrst introduced
ﬁre to the human race, hence an eternal ﬂame that was burned in his honour in the
temple of Apollo Lykaios in Argos.6
Phoroneus married a nymph who is variously named as Teledike, Kerdo or Peitho,7
and fathered a daughter NIOBE, who was the ﬁrst mortal woman to bear a child
to Zeus. This marked the opening of an era in mythological time that 
would be brought to an end when Alkmene, a descendant of Niobe in the sixteenth
generation, gave birth to Herakles, the last child borne to Zeus by a mortal 
woman. As the child of her liaison with Zeus, Niobe gave birth to ARGOS, the
eponym of the city and land. His tomb and sacred grove could be seen near the
city of Argos.8
Argos, who has no myths at all, was succeeded by one of his sons, PEIREN (or
Peiras, or Peirasos, or Peiranthos), who was the father of IO in the earliest tradi-
tion.9 In some later accounts, however, the Argive king-list was lengthened slightly,
and Io came to be described as a descendant of Argos in the third or fourth
generation, as the daughter of a certain Iasos.10 Or conversely, authors such as the
Attic tragedians and Ovid, who were not concerned about the niceties of the local
tradition or questions of mythical chronology, ignored all the intervening kings 
and simply described Io as a daughter of the river-god Inachos.11 This latter
genealogy became so familiar, indeed, that authors of the Hellenistic and Roman
periods could refer to her as ‘the daughter of Inachos’ without needing to specify
her name.
Io is seduced by Zeus, transformed into a cow, and placed 
under the guard of Argos Panoptes
The father of Io (whoever he may have been) appointed her to be the virgin priestess
of Argive Hera, but she was so very beautiful that Zeus seduced her, and she came
to be transformed into a cow as a consequence, temporarily at least. In Apollodorus’
account, which may have been largely based on that offered in the Hesiodic Catalogue,
Zeus turned her into a white cow with a touch of his hand when Hera came to
learn of their relationship, and then swore to his wife that he had never had inter-
course with the girl. As a result of this divine precedent, so ‘Hesiod’ remarks,
perjuries committed for the sake of love have never attracted anger or punishment
from the gods. Hera was not deceived, however, by Zeus’s action in transforming
Io or his protestations, and demanded that the cow should be handed over to her.
She then placed it under the guard of ARGOS PANOPTES (the All-Seeing), 
who was well equipped to serve as a watchman because he never slept and had eyes
all over his body, or at least one or two additional eyes in the back of his neck.12
— The early history of the Inachids —
228

In another account of Io’s transformation, Hera performed it herself to put an end
to the love affair; but Zeus continued to consort with Io in her new form by assuming
the form of a bull, and Hera was then obliged to place the cow under the guard of
the many-eyed Argos.13
Zeus was determined to gain possession of the cow and ordered Hermes, the patron
god of thieves, to steal it away from under the eyes of its guard. It was tethered to an
olive-tree in a sacred grove between Argos and Mycenae (or else by the Heraion near
Mycenae). Although Hermes initially planned to remove it by stealth, his intentions
were betrayed by a certain Hierax (Hawk, who may perhaps have been turned 
into a bird of that kind as a punishment for his indiscretion). So the god resorted to
force instead, and killed Argos Panoptes with a well-aimed stone before untying the
cow.14 Or in Ovid’s account, he lulled Argos to sleep by playing on his reed-pipes
and by passing his magic wand over the monster’s eyes, and then cut off his head with
a sickle.15 This story of the slaying of Argos was evidently devised to provide an
explanation for Hermes’ ancient title of Argeiphontes (of uncertain origin and
meaning, but here interpreted as meaning Argos-slayer).16
Although it is unlikely that a local monster like Argos Panoptes would have been credited
with any speciﬁc parentage in the earliest tradition, he is usually ﬁtted into the Argive royal

family at some point in surviving accounts, as a son or descendant of Argos, son of Niobe.
Some followed Acusilaus, on the other hand, in describing him as earthborn. According to
Pherecydes, who describes him as a son of Arestor and thus a great-grandson of the ﬁrst
Argos, Hera prepared him for his guard-duties by placing an extra eye in the back of his 
neck and rendering him sleepless; or in the Hesiodic Aigimios, in which he was also rendered
sleepless by Hera, he had four eyes overall, two in the usual position and two on the 
back of his neck.17 In the standard later tradition, however, he had numerous eyes all over
his body, giving him a most striking appearance, as can be appreciated from portrayals of
him in ﬁfth-century vase-paintings. He was very large besides and liked to wear a bull’s
hide as a cape.18 Apollodorus explains the origin of the cape by saying that Argos took it
from a bull which had been causing havoc in neighbouring Arcadia; and he also reports that
Argos once killed a Satyr who had been robbing the Arcadians of their cattle, and even
killed the monstrous Echidna (see p. 62).19 According to Moschus, a Hellenistic bucolic
poet, the peacock with its many-eyed tail sprang up from the blood of the dead Argos; 
or in later accounts, Hera is said to have transferred his eyes into the tail of the peacock,
or to have transformed Argos himself into a peacock.20 The peacock was the special bird of
Hera, just as the owl was the bird of Athena. The name of this Argos remains familiar in
modern usage as a title for newspapers (which are supposed to let nothing escape their view)
and in the expression ‘Argos-eyed’. Apollonius attributes the building of the Argo to an
Argos who wore a bull’s hide cape; although this Argos, who is described as a son of Arestor,
was evidently modelled on the present Argos, he can hardly be identiﬁed with him because 
the Argonauts lived many generations later; and the poet presumably intended that he should
be regarded as a descendant of his.21
Apollodorus may be consulted for an account of the early history of the Argolid that was
probably derived from the Argive mythographer Acusilaus (late sixth century BC) for the
most part; Pelasgos, the earthborn ﬁrst man of Arcadia (see p. 537), is here annexed to 
the Argive royal line as a son of Niobe and brother of Argos.22 Acusilaus also provided
Sparta with an Argive eponym in the form of a brother of Niobe called Sparton (although
any Spartan would have been astonished to hear of this, as Pausanias remarks).23 Peiren, the
traditional father of Io, was an ancient ﬁgure with cultic associations; he was said to have
erected the ﬁrst cultic image of Hera, a pear-wood statue which was set up by him at Tiryns
but later transferred to the great Heraion near Mycenae.24
The Prometheus Bound offers a singular account of Io’s troubles. While asleep in her
father’s palace, she was visited by beguiling dreams that urged her to go out to the
meadows of Lerna (to the south of Argos) to allow Zeus to make love to her. She
took no action, however, and ﬁnally summoned up the courage to report her trou-
bles to her father Inachos, who sent envoys to the oracles at Delphi and Dodona to
ask what he should do; and when he at last received a clear answer, he was told
that he should turn Io out of his house or else suffer the destruction of his race.
When he took this action under force of necessity, Io was immediately transformed
into a cow; and she was goaded by a gadﬂy to proceed to Lerna and then from 
land to land. Aeschylus’ account of the events that followed Io’s expulsion from the
palace, as presented in her own narrative, is wilfully obscure; we are not told who
transformed her, or when Zeus caused her to become pregnant. It is perhaps reason-
able to assume that Hera transformed her and sent her on her wanderings in order
to frustrate her husband’s desire, and that Zeus had no physical relations with her
until he made her pregnant in Egypt (her ultimate home, see below) with a touch
of his hand.25
— The early history of the Inachids —
230

Ovid’s account is picturesque and unproblematic. Hera realized that her husband
was up to mischief on observing a patch of darkness that he had spread over Argos
to conceal his dalliance; and as she was hurrying to the spot, Zeus turned Io into
a cow to hide her presence. Hera then asked to be given the beast and placed it
under guard, as in the early version summarized above. Ovid adds an attractive
detail to the story at this point: to reassure her father Inachos, who had no idea
where she was and feared that she was dead, the transformed Io revealed her iden-
tity and fate to him by tracing letters in the dust with her hoof.26
Io wanders to Egypt, where she is returned to human form 
and gives birth to Epaphos
On ﬁnding that Hermes had foiled her plan to conﬁne the cow in one place, Hera
sent a gadﬂy against it to ensure that it would now be constantly on the move
without a moment’s rest. In the ﬁnal form of the myth, Io wandered all the way 
to Egypt before ﬁnding any relief. Although it is impossible to trace the earlier
evolution of the myth in any detail or with much certainty, her wanderings would
surely have been conﬁned to the Argolid in the earliest tradition; and it has been
plausibly suggested that she would have roamed from the city of Argos to the great
Heraion near Mycenae, which was located on a hill known as Euboia. A subsequent
version of the story, perhaps originating in Euboea itself, suggested that she trav-
elled considerably further, to the island of Euboea (properly Euboia) off Central
Greece; a fragment from the Hesiodic Aigimios indicates that she was once there and
that Zeus named the island Euboea (interpreted as meaning ‘Good Cow Land’) in
her honour; and in the later tradition at least, Io was sometimes said to have settled
on Euboea and to have given birth to Zeus’s son in a cave on the island.27 By the
classical period, a more extravagant version had established itself in which the trans-
formed Io went all the way to Egypt, where Zeus restored her to her original form
and so enabled her to give birth to her child. We should imagine her as travelling
northwards through Greece, doubtless calling in at Euboea on the way, and then
through Thrace and across the Bosporos (i.e. Cow’s Strait) into Asia Minor, before
passing down through Syria and Phoenicia to her ultimate destination. In the
Prometheus Bound, her itinerary is more extravagant still, taking her to the Caucasus,
where she meets the enchained Prometheus, who predicts that her journey will take
her across the Cimmerian Bosporos and past the Graiai and Gorgons, and the
Arimaspians and Grifﬁns (see p. 580).28 Some claimed that the Ionian Sea (between
Greece and lower Italy) was named after her because she had visited its shores during
her wanderings.29
When Io arrived in Egypt, Zeus returned her to her proper form, and she gave
birth to a son, EPAPHOS, beside the banks of the Nile. It could be explained that
he was given this name because Zeus had delivered his mother from her animal
form with a touch (epaphe¯) of his hand, or had rendered her pregnant with a touch.30
Io came to be identiﬁed with the Egyptian goddess Isis, although there is no deﬁ-
nite evidence for this until the Hellenistic period, and her son Epaphos was identiﬁed
with Apis, the bull-god who was worshipped at Memphis, as Herodotus already
records.31 In a relatively late myth which was obviously inspired by the Egyptian

myth of Isis’ search for the lost Osiris, the Kouretes are said to have stolen the
infant Epaphos at the bidding of Hera, causing the unfortunate Io to set off on her
travels once again; she roamed northward through Syria in search of him until she
ﬁnally discovered him at Byblos, a coastal city to the north of Sidon, where she was
being tended by the wife of the king. The Kouretes, who seem ill-suited to this
role as former protectors of the infant Zeus (see p. 75), were presumably inserted
in place of some Egyptian deities. We are told that Zeus killed them by way of
punishment. After recovering her son, Io returned to Egypt, where she married
Telegonos, the king of the Egyptians who adopted Epaphos as his successor.32
The immediate descendants of Io, and the dividing of the 
Inachid line
In the Greek tradition, Epaphos was the great city-founder of early Egypt. He is
already mentioned in this connection by Pindar, who refers to ‘the numerous cities
founded in Egypt by the hand of Epaphos’; and Hyginus reports correspondingly that
Zeus ordered him to fortify the cities in Egypt and reign there, and that he founded
Memphis and many other towns.33 Although Hyginus names his wife as Kassiepeia,
it was commonly thought that he married Memphis, a daughter of the Nile, and
founded the great city of Memphis in Lower Egypt in her name.34 Memphis bore him
a daughter who was of still greater signiﬁcance as an eponym, namely LIBYE, who
gave her name to the African territories to the west of Egypt (a much broader area
than the modern Libya).35 Poseidon abducted Libye and fathered twin sons by her,
BELOS, who remained in Egypt and succeeded Epaphos as king, and AGENOR, who
departed to Phoenicia to found a kingdom of his own.36
It is at this point that the Inachid family divides into its two main branches, for
the Argive royal family will be formed from descendants of Belos, while two chil-
dren of Agenor will found new Inachid ruling lines in Crete and Thebes; see 
Table 4. We will concentrate on Belos’ branch of the family in the present chapter,
examining in the ﬁrst place how one of his sons and all of his grandchildren came
to return to their ancestral homeland in Argos. The history of the Agenorids will
be traced in Chapters 8 and 9. As was noted above, the immediate family of Agenor
was scattered after his daughter Europa was abducted to Crete by Zeus; for he sent
his sons in search of her, telling them to stay away until they had found her, and
they all settled abroad after failing in their quest (see p. 294). His most important
son, Kadmos, founded a royal line in Central Greece after founding the city of
Thebes at the order of the Delphic oracle (see pp. 295ff), while Europa bore Minos
and other children to Zeus on Crete, and so became the founder of the ruling family
of the island (see pp. 337ff).37
The Danaids ﬂee to Argos in the hope of escaping their suitors, 
the sons of Aigyptos
BELOS is of genealogical signiﬁcance alone. His name is simply a Hellenized form
of the Semitic word Baal (meaning Lord), a title that was applied to local presiding
gods in the Near East. He succeeded to the Egyptian throne and married Anchinoe,
— The early history of the Inachids —
232

daughter of the Nile, who bore him twin sons, DANAOS and AIGYPTOS.38
Kepheus and Phineus, the father and uncle of Andromeda (see pp. 240 and 242),
are also classed as sons of Belos in some accounts39 (but see also on p. 295); and
according to the Hesiodic Catalogue, he had a daughter Thronie who bore Arabos,
the eponym of the Arabs, to Hermes.40
Aigyptos was of course the eponym of the Egyptians (Aigyptoi in Greek).
According to Apollodorus, he was installed in Arabia by his father while Danaos was
installed in Libya, but he later conquered the land of the Melampodes (Blackfeet, 
presumably Egyptians who were not already under the rule of his father) and 
named it Egypt after himself. He and Danaos fathered large families by many differ-
ent women in a manner that was more oriental than Greek, Aigyptos fathering ﬁfty
sons, and Danaos ﬁfty daughters who were known as the DANAIDS (DANAIDES).
The two brothers eventually quarrelled because Aigyptos was determined to marry his
sons to the Danaids, a scheme that was repugnant to Danaos since it would mean that
his family would be absorbed into that of his brother, and his own position would be
greatly weakened as a consequence. According to a surviving fragment from the
Danais, an early epic that was devoted to the legend of Danaos, the Danaids went so
far as to arm themselves by the banks of the Nile, evidently with the intention of
resisting their cousins by force.41 In accordance with a suggestion from Athena,
Danaos tried to escape the problem by building a large ﬁfty-oared ship and ﬂeeing to
Argos with his daughters. Some claimed that this was the ﬁrst large seagoing ship
ever to be constructed; and although this honour was more commonly credited to the
Argo (see p. 382), the legend of Danaos is certainly set at an earlier period in mythi-
cal history.42 In further explanation of his ﬂight, it was sometimes stated that he had
received an oracle warning him that he would be killed by one of the sons of Aigyptos
if they should marry his daughters.43
After stopping off at Lindos on Rhodes, where the Danaids founded the temple
of Athena and their father dedicated a statue to the goddess,44 they arrived at Argos,
which was now under the rule of GELANOR, son of Sthenelas. As the leading
member of another branch of the Inachid ruling family, Gelanor had a legitimate
claim to the throne, but he agreed to abdicate in favour of Danaos either of his own
free will or in obedience to a sign from the gods. A local version of the story is
recorded in the cultic legend that was devised to explain the origin of the shrine
of Apollo Lykaios at Argos. When Danaos arrived to claim the kingdom, the citi-
zens of Argos listened patiently to his arguments and those of Gelanor but found
that the issue seemed so evenly balanced (as it might well have been on the crucial
matter of descent) that they deferred their decision until the next day. The matter
was resolved on their behalf, however, by a sign from the gods; for at dawn on the
following morning, a wolf suddenly broke into a herd of cattle that was grazing 
just outside the city walls, and killed the leading bull; and the Argives interpreted
this as a portent that indicated that the newcomer (as represented in the wolf) should
displace the present ruler (as represented in the bull). Believing that Apollo had 
sent the wolf (lykos), Danaos expressed his gratitude by founding the cult of Apollo
Lykaios (here interpreted as meaning Apollo of the Wolves). He also founded 
Larisa, the citadel of Argos, and gave his name to his subjects, who were known
thenceforth as Danaans rather than Pelasgians as previously.45

Danaos incites his daughters to murder the sons of Aigyptos 
on their wedding-night
Refusing to be deterred by the ﬂight of their cousins, the sons of Aigyptos soon
arrived in Argos to press their suit. They assumed a conciliatory tone, inviting
Danaos to abandon his enmity and consent to a union between the two families; 
but he mistrusted their intentions, and bore them a grudge in addition because he
had been forced to ﬂee from his original kingdom. So he molliﬁed them by
pretending to agree to the marriages, and cast lots to assign each of his daughters 
to a speciﬁc bridegroom; when the time came for the wedding, however, he secretly
provided his daughters with daggers and instructed them to kill their husbands 
while they were asleep on their wedding-night. They all obeyed him with the sole
exception of Hypermnestra (or Hypermestra), who spared her husband Lynkeus 
(see below).46
According to Apollodorus, Athena and Hermes puriﬁed the Danaids from their
crime at the order of Zeus, and Danaos subsequently married them off by awarding
them to the victors of an athletic contest.47 This story of the contest must have
been a fairly ancient story since it was known to Pindar, and the detail about the
divine puriﬁcation was probably at least as old, since something of the kind would
have been necessary if the Danaids were to be marriageable after committing such
a crime. As Pindar tells the story, Danaos found new husbands for forty-eight of
his daughters (i.e. all except Hypermnestra and Amymone, see below) before noon
on a single day by lining them up at the ﬁnishing-line of a race-track and causing
their suitors to race for them. The suitors evidently made their choice (perhaps by
touching their chosen bride) in the order in which they completed the race.48 In a
later version recorded by Pausanias, in which the story has lost its naivety and even
acquired a comical edge, the young men of the time were unwilling to marry the
Danaids on account of their guilt until Danaos offered to give them away without
receiving a bride-price. When some suitors arrived, though not very many, he orga-
nized a foot-race to determine their order of choice; and the girls who were left over
had to await the arrival of further suitors and another race.49 According to a well-
known story from the later tradition, the Danaids were punished forever in the world
below by being forced to attempt the impossible task of fetching water in leaky
jars, or ﬁlling a leaky cistern. As has already been observed, this motif of futile
water-carrying was originally devised to illustrate the posthumous predicament of
those who had failed to have themselves initiated into the mysteries, and the task
was transferred to the Danaids at some stage in the Hellenistic period (see p. 119).50
It seems to have been ﬁrmly established in the local tradition that the massacre was com-
mitted at Lerna to the south of Argos, where the sons of Aigyptos had set up their camp.
According to Pausanias, who based his report on direct knowledge of the local memorials,
the bodies of the sons of Aigyptos were buried separately from their heads since the 
Danaids took the heads to their father in Argos as proof of their deed.51 The proverbial 
phrase ‘a Lerna of evils’ referred to this tradition that claimed that the sons of Aigyptos had
been buried there.52 It is worth noting, incidentally, that if exception is made for one Byzan-
tine account,53 the bodies are always said to have been buried rather than thrown into the
swamps or lakes of the area (an action that would have tainted the waters). Apollodorus is
— The early history of the Inachids —
234

exceptional in suggesting that the Danaids buried the heads at Lerna and the bodies with
proper funeral rites in front of Danaos; one may suspect that the proper locations have been
inverted by error.54
Aigyptos was usually said to have remained behind in Egypt when his sons pursued the
Danaids to Argos; but the early Attic tragedian Phrynichos represented him as travelling 
to Greece with his sons, and Pausanias records a story from Patrai that carries the same
implication. For according to the local tradition at that city, which lay on the northern coast
of the Peloponnese, he had ﬂed to Patrai (then called Aroe) in horror at the murder of his
children, and was buried there in a tomb that could be seen in historical times.55
The Danaid Amymone is seduced by Poseidon, and bears 
him a son, Nauplios
Two of the Danaids alone escaped the guilt of murder, Hypermnestra because she
spared her husband and AMYMONE because she was unable to marry, having
become pregnant beforehand in the following circumstances. On arriving in Argos,
Danaos had found that there was a shortage of water and had sent his daughters in
search of further supplies; and Amymone had wandered to the district of Lerna, on
the shores of the Argolic Gulf a few miles south of the city of Argos. In contrast
to most of the Argolid, which was notoriously dry, this was a well-watered region
with permanent springs, streams and swamps; and it was said that it owed its abun-
dant water to Amymone (in part at least) because she had encountered Poseidon
there and he had rewarded her for her favours by creating a spring or springs with
a blow of his trident. The fullest accounts all involve a Satyr, following a version
developed by Aeschylus, who wrote a Satyr-play about Amymone to complement
his Danaid trilogy. In the course of her journey, Amymone threw her hunting-spear
at a deer, but happened to hit a sleeping Satyr instead; he leapt up and tried to
rape her, but she was saved by the intervention of Poseidon, who scared the Satyr
away and proceeded to seduce her, and rewarded her afterwards by revealing or
creating the springs of Lerna.56 Or in a slightly different version, the Satyr set out
to rape her when she fell asleep from exhaustion, but Poseidon scared him off by
hurling his trident, which became embedded in a rock; after winning her favours,
he told her that she would gain her reward if she pulled the trident out of the rock,
and three springs of water gushed forth when she did so (one for each prong).57
This legend explained the origin of the spring of Amymone at Lerna, which gave
rise to a sizeable stream of the same name.
By creating this new source of water, Poseidon made partial amends for having
deprived Argos of most of its water long ago after he was defeated by Hera in a
contest for the land (see p. 103). Lerna was richly provided with water because its
springs were fed by underground channels from Arcadia; there were marshes there
too which were signiﬁcant in myth as the home of the Lernaian hydra (see p. 258),
and a bottomless lake which communicated with the Underworld (see p. 109).58
Amymone was supposed to have discovered a well at the city of Argos too, as were
three of her sisters; the services that were performed by the Danaids in this regard
were already noted in the Hesiodic Catalogue.59
As the result of her liaison with Poseidon, Amymone gave birth to a son,
NAUPLIOS (Seafarer), who founded the city of Nauplia (later Nauplion) in the

north-eastern corner of the Argolic Gulf.60 He used this city, which was the sea-
port of Tiryns, as his home-port during his long career as a seafarer. His legends
fall into two groups, those in which rulers asked him to dispose of their daughters
for different reasons (see pp. 355 and 543), and those in which he took action against
the Greeks who had fought at Troy (see pp. 485 and 487) to avenge the murder of
his son Palamedes at Troy (see p. 460). Ancient authors ascribe all these stories to
the same person even though this would mean that he must have lived for many
generations; Apollodorus notes the point by remarking that he was long-lived
(makrobios, perhaps as a privilege granted to him by his divine father, as in the case
of Sarpedon, see p. 350). Apollonius and some subsequent authors mention a later
Nauplios who was a descendant of the original in the ﬁfth generation, but only as
a skilled seaman who sailed with the Argonauts;61 there is no indication in surviving
sources that the Nauplios who acted against the Greeks after the Trojan War was
ever identiﬁed with this other Nauplios, son of Klytoneos, rather than the earlier
son of Poseidon and Amymone.
In the Returns, an early epic in the Trojan cycle, the wife of Nauplios was appar-
ently a certain Philyra, but in tragedy and later sources she is always Klymene, a
daughter of Katreus, king of Crete;62 for the story of how he came to marry her,
see p. 355. The couple had one son of major importance, Palamedes, an ingenious
inventor who met an ignominious death at Troy through the machinations of
Odysseus (see pp. 459–60), and two other sons of lesser note, Oiax (see p. 460) and
Nausimedon.63
The Danaid Hypermnestra saves her husband Lynkeus, 
and bears him a son, Abas
The only Danaid marriage to last beyond the wedding-day was that of HYPERM-
NESTRA, who spared her husband LYNKEUS because she was grateful to him 
for not forcing himself on her during their wedding-night, or because she conceived
an immediate love for him.64 On learning from her of Danaos’ plot, he took ﬂight
to Lyrkeia, a settlement high on a hillside a few miles to the north-west of Argos,
and lit a beacon to let Hypermnestra know that he had escaped unharmed; and 
she lit one in response on Larisa, the acropolis of the city of Argos, to show that
she too was safe. This legend furnished an explanation for the origin of an annual
festival of beacons that was celebrated in Argos.65 Danaos was so angered by
Hypermnestra’s disobedience that he had her imprisoned, or even went so far as to
bring her to trial, alleging that she had placed his own life in danger by allowing
Lynkeus to escape, and had made the disgrace all the worse for her sisters and himself
by taking no part in the crime; but she was acquitted by the citizens of Argos, and
commemorated her victory by dedicating a statue of Aphrodite Nikephoros (Bringer
of Victory) in the city and by founding a sanctuary of Artemis Peitho (of
Persuasion).66 Danaos ﬁnally relented as time passed by and his anger subsided, and
agreed to accept Lynkeus as his son-in-law and heir.67 Or in a less favoured version,
Lynkeus took matters into his own hands and seized power by killing Danaos.68 He
succeeded Danaos as king in any case, and was succeeded in his turn by his son
ABAS, who shared equally in the blood of Danaos and Aigyptos.69
— The early history of the Inachids —
236

It was said that Lynkeus happened to be in the temple of Hera in Argos when
Abas arrived with the news of Danaos’ death. When he looked around for a gift to
give to his son in memory of the occasion, his eyes fell on a shield that Danaos had
carried during his youth and had later dedicated in the temple; so he took it down
and gave it to Abas, and also founded the quinquennial games known as the Shield
of Argos, at which the victors were awarded a shield.70 Shields were something of
an Argive speciality, but the mythographers disagree on whether the distinctive
round shields of the land were invented by Danaos himself, or by his grandson Abas,
or his great-grandsons Proitos and Akrisios.71 The tomb of Danaos could be seen
in the marketplace at Argos, not far from the joint tomb of Lynkeus and
Hypermnestra.72 Abas married Aglaia, daughter of Mantineus, who bore him twin
sons, Proitos and Akrisios.73 Some authors identiﬁed this Abas with the Euboean
ruler of the same name (see p. 520), explaining that this son of Lynkeus ﬁnally left
Argos to conquer Euboea.74
Proitos and Akrisios, the warring twin sons of Abas, 
divide the kingdom
In myth and folklore, twins tend to be presented either as the closest of friends or
as the ﬁercest of enemies. PROITOS and AKRISIOS fought with one another even
while they were still inside their mother’s womb, and quarrelled over the kingdom
after their father’s death, resorting to arms to settle the issue.75 According to the
local tradition in the Argolid, they met in battle a few miles east of Argos by the
road to Epidaurus, but their two armies proved to be so evenly matched that they
were obliged to negotiate a compromise. So Akrisios, as the ﬁrst-born, took power
at the ancestral capital of Argos, while Proitos founded a new centre of rule at
Tiryns, on a rocky hill in the Argive plain a few miles to the south-east of Argos.
The reputed site of the battle was marked in historical times by a pyramidal monu-
ment with relief sculptures of Argive shields on the side; it was often said that the
brothers invented these distinctive round shields during the conﬂict, making them
either from wood or from bronze. The ﬁght was commemorated in an annual Argive
festival known as the Daulis.76
In a more elaborate account of the feud, as recorded by Apollodorus, Proitos was
initially defeated and expelled by Akrisios, who agreed to the above-mentioned
compromise only after Proitos had evened the odds by acquiring support from
abroad. For when he was forced into exile, he sought refuge with Iobates, king of
Lycia, in the south-western corner of Asia Minor; and Iobates not only gave him
his daughter Stheneboia in marriage, but helped to restore him to his own land 
by providing him with a force of Lycian troops. With the aid of these new-found
allies, Proitos established a foothold in the Argolid by occupying the hilltop at
Tiryns, and compelled his brother to share the land with him. So Proitos ruled 
at Tiryns, which was fortiﬁed for him by the Kyklopes (see p. 66), while Akrisios
ruled at Argos.77 Proitos had Lycian connections from a very early period since 
the Iliad already mentions that his wife (here called Anteia) was the daughter of a
Lycian king.78 A choral ode by Bacchylides provides the earliest surviving account
of his conﬂict with Akrisios, telling how the relentless feud between the two

brothers, ‘which sprang up from a small beginning’, caused such misery to the people
of Argos that they ﬁnally lost patience and appealed to the pair to divide the land
into two.79
Proitos fathered a single son, Megapenthes, by his wife Stheneboia, and three
daughters, Lysippe, Iphinoe and Iphianassa.80 During his reign at Tiryns, he became
involved in two unhappy episodes that will be considered in further detail else-
where. In the ﬁrst place, he offered refuge to Bellerophon, an exile from Corinth,
but was provoked into dishonourable action when his wife falsely accused the young
hero of having tried to rape her after he rejected her advances. Although Proitos
sent him away to his father-in-law in Lycia with a secret message asking that he
should be put to death, he was spared after surviving various perilous ordeals (see
further on pp. 433–4). It was sometimes said that he returned to Tiryns to wreak
vengeance on Stheneboia (see p. 434).81 On another occasion, the three daughters
of Proitos went mad (along with other women of the land in one version of the
legend), and the king had to call on the aid of the great seer Melampous, who
demanded a share of the kingdom for himself and his brother Bias as his fee for the
cure (see pp. 428–9). This episode was of lasting signiﬁcance because Melampous 
and Bias established new royal lines, introducing further complications into the
pattern of rule in the Argolid. Proitos named his son Megapenthes (Great Sorrow)
in commemoration of the anguish that was caused to him by the madness of his
daughters.82 Megapenthes succeeded to his father’s kingdom, but later agreed to
exchange it for that of Perseus, the grandson of Akrisios (see p. 243). We will
consider the subsequent history of the descendants of Proitos, and also of the new
royal lines descended from Melampous and Bias, in connection with the Theban
Wars in Chapter 9 (see pp. 316ff and 332ff).
Danae bears Perseus to Zeus, and is set adrift with him 
by her father Akrisios
The other twin, Akrisios, married Eurydike, the daughter of Lakedaimon, king of
Sparta, who bore him a daughter, DANAE, but failed to produce any male chil-
dren. When he consulted the Delphic oracle about his lack of an heir, he was told
that he would never father a male child, but that his daughter would give birth to
a son who would kill him. In the hope of preventing her from ever coming into
contact with men, he built an underground chamber of bronze in the courtyard of
his palace and imprisoned her in it along with her nurse.83 Or in an alternative
version which ﬁrst appears in Horace and Ovid, he imprisoned her in a tower of
bronze.84 His precautions achieved nothing, however, since Zeus fell in love with
Danae and slipped down through the roof into her lap in the form of a shower of
gold, causing her to conceive a mighty son, PERSEUS.85
On hearing the sound of Perseus’ voice as he was playing in the underground
chamber at the age of three or four, Danaos sent his servants to investigate, and
they brought Danae up to the light together with her infant son and nurse. The
king put the nurse to death and dragged Danae to the altar of Zeus Herkeios (of
the Courtyard) to question her about the origin of her child. When she replied that
— The early history of the Inachids —
238

Zeus was to blame, he refused to believe her, and packed her into a chest along
with her son and hurled it into the sea.86 Or in a less favoured version, which may
have been quite ancient if it is correctly ascribed to Pindar, Danae gave birth to
Perseus after being seduced by her uncle Proitos (a tale that was evidently devised
to explain why the two brothers came to be estranged).87
The chest drifted eastward across the Aegean to Seriphos, an island in the Cyclades;
in some touching verses by Simonides, Danae sings a sad lament to her infant son
as they are blown through the sea in the dark in their little brass-ribbed vessel.88
They fell into kindly hands on their arrival, however, since DIKTYS, the brother
of the king of Seriphos, took them into his home after the chest became entangled
in his ﬁshing-nets or was washed ashore on the beach. Diktys and his brother (or
half-brother) POLYDEKTES were usually classed as sons of Magnes, son of Aiolos
(see p. 436), although Pherecydes refers to them as sons of a certain Peristhenes who
was descended from Nauplios. Perseus was reared by Diktys, who treated him and
his mother as members of his own family, and all went well until the king caught
sight of Danae and conceived a passion for her.89
The king of Seriphos sends Perseus to fetch the Gorgon’s head
Being a man of very different character from his noble-minded brother, Polydektes
was determined to gain her favours by fair means or foul, but realized that this
would be difﬁcult to achieve while her formidable son, who had now grown of age,
was there to protect her; so he sent Perseus away on a dangerous mission under the
following circumstances. Letting it be known that he was planning to marry
Hippodameia, daughter of Oinomaos, and wanted to collect contributions for the
bride-price that he would be obliged to pay to her father, he invited the leading 
men of the island, including Perseus, to an eranos (a form of feast at which those
who attended were expected to make a contribution). When Perseus asked him what
sort of contribution he was expecting, he replied ‘a horse’ (a very valuable item in
those days), and the young man exclaimed that he would grudge him nothing, not
even the Gorgon’s head; so on the next day, when all the contributors arrived with
their horses, Polydektes refused to accept a horse from Perseus, but pretended to
take his purely rhetorical offer seriously and demanded that he should actually fetch
the Gorgon’s head. For the king was aware that the Gorgon was so ugly that anyone
who saw her would be turned to stone, and he could thus expect to be rid of Perseus
once and for all.90 It is characteristic of such tales that the hero should propose his
own ordeal, as we will see with Jason (p. 381). Although it is quite often stated in
modern accounts that Perseus (who might be expected to have been poor) was unable
to provide a horse, there is no indication of this in ancient sources; the idea seems
to have arisen from a misreading of Apollodorus’ narrative.91
Filled with despair at his seemingly hopeless predicament, Perseus withdrew to
the remotest part of the island to brood on the matter; but his distress was observed
by Hermes, who urged him take courage after hearing his story, and joined together
with Athena to guide him to the sisters of the Gorgons, the Graiai (Old Women),
who would be able to provide him with some invaluable information. By seizing

the single eye and tooth that the three sisters shared between them (see p. 59),
Perseus forced them to reveal the way to some nymphs who would be able to furnish
him with the tools that would enable him to fulﬁl his task, namely some winged
sandals to carry him through the air to the lair of the Gorgons at the ends of the
earth, the cap of Hades to render him invisible as he seized the Gorgon’s head, and
a metallic satchel (kibisis, a word that appears in no other context) to hold the head
after he had cut it off. After acquiring these objects from the nymphs, and also
receiving an adamantine sickle (harpe¯) from Hermes, Perseus ﬂew beyond the outer
Ocean with Hermes and Athena, and crept up on the Gorgons as they lay asleep.
For their origin and nature, see pp. 58–61.
The two deities advised him to avert his gaze as he cut off the Gorgon’s head,
and pointed to MEDUSA as the one whom he should attack since her two sisters
were immortal. So he went up to Medusa, severed her head, placed it in the kibisis,
and ﬂed with all speed, successfully escaping the other two Gorgons, who tried to
pursue him but were unable to ﬁnd him because he was wearing the cap of invis-
ibility. Such is Pherecydes’ version, which originated in early epic; it is reported in
subsequent accounts that Athena guided his hand as he cut off the head, and that
he assisted himself in the process by observing the Gorgon’s reﬂection in the polished
surface of his bronze shield. Since Medusa was pregnant with Pegasos and Chrysaor,
two children whom she had conceived to Poseidon (see p. 60), they sprang from
her neck when her head was removed.92 In a wholly different account from the lost
Phorkides of Aeschylus, the Graiai acted as guards to their sisters, but Perseus
prevented them from fulﬁlling their task by hurling their single eye into the
Tritonian lake.93
Perseus rescues Andromeda from a sea-monster, and 
exacts revenge on the king of Seriphos
As Perseus was ﬂying home with his trophy, he passed the kingdom of Kepheus, son
of Belos or Phoinix, in Ethiopia (or Phoenicia), and noticed that a girl of wonderful
beauty had been chained to a rock by the seashore. This was ANDROMEDA, 
a princess of the land, who had been exposed there as prey to a sea-monster as the
result of an indiscretion that had been committed by her mother KASSIEPEIA. 
For the queen had foolishly boasted that she was lovelier than the Nereids, angering
not only the sea-nymphs themselves but Poseidon too, who responded by sending a
ﬂood and a sea-monster against the land; and when the oracle of Ammon (at the 
oasis of Siwa in the Libyan desert) had declared that the calamity would not be
brought to an end until Kassiepeia’s daughter were offered up to the monster, the
king had bound her to a rock by the shore at the insistence of his people. Perseus 
fell in love with her at ﬁrst sight, however, and undertook to slay the monster if she
would promise to marry him; or in a slightly different version, he approached her
father Kepheus and won an equivalent promise from him. He then proceeded to kill
the monster with his sword or sickle (or else turned it to stone by showing it the
Gorgon’s head).94
When he came to claim his bride, he met with some difﬁculty nonetheless, either
because her parents were reluctant to hand her over to a stranger with uncertain

when they tried to seize Andromeda from him during the wedding-feast.97 After
spending a year or so at the court of his father-in-law, Perseus ﬁnally set off for
Seriphos with his wife. Since Kepheus had no heir of his own, the departing couple
allowed him to adopt their ﬁrst-born child, Perses, who was destined to give his
name to the Persians.98
In the Hellenistic and later tradition, Perseus was sometimes said to have brought Mt Atlas
into being as he was passing through North Africa with the Gorgon’s head. According to
a version ascribed to Polyidos, a lyric poet of the fourth century BC, a Libyan shepherd called
Atlas tried to block his passage, provoking the hero to petrify him by showing him the
Gorgon’s head. Or in Ovid’s account, in which Atlas is a local ruler of exceptional size who
owns large ﬂocks of sheep, Perseus asked to rest for the night in his land, telling him that
he was a son of Zeus; but Atlas turned him away with the same result, because he had been
warned by a prophecy that a wonderful tree that he owned would be robbed of its golden
fruit by a son of Zeus.99 This prophecy referred of course to the apples of the Hesperides,
which would be robbed by a different son of Zeus, namely Herakles (see p. 269). According
to another tale, the poisonous snakes of Libya were born from drops of blood that dripped
from the Gorgon’s head as Perseus was ﬂying overhead.100
On arriving back in Seriphos, Perseus found that his mother and his benefactor
Diktys had sought refuge at the altars to escape the violence of the king. So he
entered the palace and invited Polydektes to assemble his friends (or the islanders
in general); and when they had gathered together, he showed them the Gorgon’s
head, causing all of them to be turned to stone in the attitude that they happened
to have assumed at the time.101 The island was notorious ever afterwards for its
many rocks. Or in another account, Perseus displayed the head to Polydektes when
the king accused him of having lied about killing Medusa.102 Now that his mother
was safe, Perseus installed Diktys on the throne in place of the dead tyrant, and
returned the satchel, winged sandals and cap of Hades to Hermes (or Athena) to be
taken back to the nymphs. As for the Gorgon’s head, he gave it to his divine helper
Athena, who ﬁxed it to the centre of her aigis (see p. 74).103
Pindar alludes to an account in which Polydektes actually forced Danae into marriage before
her son returned to rescue her.104 Hyginus records a very odd version of the legend of 
Perseus and Danae in which Polydektes becomes their benefactor rather than their enemy
and the quest for the Gorgon’s head is eliminated. On discovering Danae and her infant in
the chest, Diktys took them immediately to his brother, who married Danae and arranged
for her son to be reared in the temple of Artemis; and when Akrisios learned of their where-
abouts and came in search of them, apparently many years later, Polydektes interceded with
him on their behalf, and Perseus swore for his own part that he would never cause his grand-
father any harm. While Akrisios was detained on Seriphos by a storm, however, Polydektes
died and Perseus killed his grandfather with a discus by accident (as in the usual story, 
see below) during the funeral games for the dead king. He then sailed on to Argos to claim
his inheritance.105
— The early history of the Inachids —
242

Perseus accidentally kills his grandfather Akrisios, 
and founds Mycenae
After his adventures in Seriphos and the wider world beyond, Perseus wanted
nothing more than to settle down in his ancestral homeland. So he sailed for Argos
with his wife and mother, hoping to be reunited with his grandfather on his arrival.
Akrisios heard that he was coming, however, and ﬂed to Larisa in Thessaly, fearing
that Perseus might kill him as the oracle had predicted if they should ever meet.
When Perseus learned of this, he entrusted his wife and mother to his grandmother
Eurydike and set off for Thessaly to convince his grandfather that he intended him
no harm. While the two of them were still in Larisa, however, Teutamides, the king
of the city, held some funeral games in honour of his father, and Perseus took the
opportunity to demonstrate his skill with the discus (which was supposed to have
been invented by him); and while making one of his throws, he accidentally struck
his grandfather on the foot, inﬂicting a fatal wound on him.106 Or in another version,
he encountered his grandfather at Larisa by chance when he came to compete in the
games.107 The oracle was fulﬁlled as a result of this sporting accident in any case,
and Akrisios was buried just outside Larisa, where his heroic shrine could be seen
in historical times.108
Feeling ashamed to inherit his grandfather’s kingdom after causing his death,
Perseus approached Megapenthes, son of Proitos, who was now ruling at Tiryns,
and asked him to exchange his kingdom for the former kingdom of Akrisios, which
had been ruled from the city of Argos. Instead of ruling at Tiryns, however, or at
Midea which also lay in the territory that he acquired through this exchange, Perseus
founded a new stronghold further to the north at Mycenae (properly Mykenai).109
According to one tale, he gave this name to the city because the cap from the end
of his scabbard (mykos in Greek) had fallen off when he ﬁrst arrived at the site, and
this had been the sign that had prompted him to found the city there; or else he
chose this name because he had been thirsty when he arrived there, and a refreshing
spring had gushed forth when he had pulled up a mushroom (mykos again!).110 With
regard to the latter story, it may be relevant that a spring known as the Perseia
could be seen at the city ruins in historical times.111 Perseus invited the Kyklopes
to construct the massive ‘Cyclopean’ walls that can still be seen at Mycenae, and
also to fortify Midea for him.112 The only adventure recorded for Perseus during his
subsequent years in the Argolid is the strange story of his conﬂict with Dionysos
and the women from the sea (see p. 175).
The children of Perseus and Andromeda; the exile of 
Amphitryon and Alkmene
Andromeda bore ﬁve sons to Perseus during their years in Mycenae, namely
Elektryon, Sthenelos, Alkaios, Mestor and Heleios, and also a daughter who was
named Gorgophone (Gorgon-slayer) in memory of her father’s greatest deed.113
Gorgophone ﬁrst married Perieres, king of Messenia (see p. 422) and then Oibalos,
king of Sparta; it was said that she was the ﬁrst woman ever to remarry after her
husband’s death.114

— The early history of the Inachids —
243

The sons and immediate descendants of Perseus are of interest in relation to the
origins and life of the greatest of his descendants, Herakles. Elektryon, who was
initially the most powerful of his sons, succeeded him as king of Mycenae, and ruled
there until he was killed in a freakish accident by his nephew Amphitryon, the
son of his brother Alkaios. Recognizing that this would give him an opportunity
to advance his own position, another son of Perseus, Sthenelos, seized power at
Mycenae and banished Amphitryon from the land on an accusation of murder. So
Amphitryon went off to Thebes, where he settled with Alkmene, the daughter of
Elektryon. After sleeping with Zeus and Amphitryon on the same night, Alkmene
gave birth to twin sons, bearing Herakles to Zeus and an inferior child to her
husband. Herakles was thus born and brought up in exile while lesser men, initially
Sthenelos and then his son Eurystheus, ruled over the former kingdom of 
Perseus (or at least the richest part of it). Zeus had intended, to be sure, that his
son should become the great ruler in Argos, but Hera tricked him to ensure that
Eurystheus (who was born at much the same time as Herakles) should gain that
inheritance instead.
This sequence of events was ﬁrst set in course when ELEKTRYON met with
trouble from some descendants of his brother Mestor and called on the assistance
of his nephew Amphitryon. Mestor and his wife, Lysidike, daughter of Pelops, had
a single child, Hippothoe, who was abducted by Poseidon to the Echinadian islands,
just to the north of the entrance to the Corinthian Gulf. She bore him a son there,
Taphios (or Taphos), the eponym of the island of Taphos, who founded the royal
family that would rule the islands thereafter. His people were called the Taphians
or Teleboans; the mythographers explained the latter name by a false etymology,
saying that Taphos conferred it on the islanders because he had ‘gone far’ (te¯lou ebe¯)
from his ancestral land of Argos. Pterelaos, the son and heir of Taphos, had six sons
of his own who sailed to the Argolid in the time of Elektryon and laid claim to
the throne of Mycenae, alleging that it properly belonged to them as descendants
of the Perseid Mestor.115
It hardly needs saying that this story makes no sense at all in terms of any rational chronol-
ogy, suggesting as it does that great-great-great-grandsons of Perseus could become involved
in a dispute with a son of Perseus! In all likelihood, the Teleboan line was originally inde-
pendent of the Perseids, and this chronological inconsistency was introduced when it came
to be classed as a branch of Perseus’ family. In another account which reduces the Teleboan
line by one generation at least, Pterelaos was the son who was borne by Hippothoe after her
abduction, and he in turn was the father of two sons, Taphios and Teleboas, who laid claim
to Elektryon’s kingdom.116
When Elektryon refused to acknowledge that the sons of Pterelaos had any claim to
his kingdom, they proceeded to steal his cattle. A ﬁerce ﬁght developed as a conse-
quence between the sons of Elektryon, who were all killed (apart from Likymnios,
who was too young to take part), and the sons of Pterelaos, who were all killed like-
wise, apart from the one who was guarding the ships. Their surviving followers
escaped with the cattle, however, and entrusted them to Polyxenos, the king of the
Eleians in the western Peloponnese.117 On learning of the fate of his sons, Elektryon
— The early history of the Inachids —
244

made preparations for a punitive expedition against the Teleboans and invited
AMPHITRYON to administer his kingdom during his absence. He placed his
daughter Alkmene in the care of his nephew, making him swear that he would not
touch her until his return. As it turned out, however, Elektryon never left his native
shore. For Amphitryon soon secured the return of the stolen cattle by ransoming them
from Polyxenos; and when one charged forward as he was receiving them back, he
hurled his club at it to try to restrain it, and the club rebounded off its horns and
struck Elektryon, killing him instantly. Or in a conﬂicting version from the Hesiodic
Shield, he quarrelled with his uncle over cattle for some reason and killed him in
anger. Whatever the exact circumstances of the killing, STHENELOS seized it as a
pretext to banish Amphitryon and take control of Mycenae, Tiryns and Midea, the
main strongholds in Perseus’ former realm.118 He ruled at Mycenae without incident
from that time onwards and bequeathed the throne to his son EURYSTHEUS, who
passed an uneventful existence until Herakles was instructed by the Delphic oracle to
travel to the Argolid to perform twelve labours at his command.
Even if there was some initial division of power between the sons of Perseus,
Sthenelos seems to have gained control of all or most of the territories and cities
that had formerly been ruled by Perseus, including Tiryns and Midea. His son and
heir Eurystheus is of importance in myth only in relation to his great half-cousin
Herakles, whose life-history will be traced in the next chapter. Although Herakles
was born abroad and spent most of his life in exile, he was obliged to perform
twelve labours at the command of Eurystheus and came to be based in the Argolid
for a time as a consequence (see pp. 253ff). It was commonly agreed that Eurystheus
was as mean-minded and cowardly (see e.g. p. 257) as Herakles was noble and 
brave. After the death of Herakles, Eurystheus tried to rid himself of any future
threat from the hero’s sons and descendants, the Heraklids, by attacking the chil-
dren of Herakles while they were at their most vulnerable (see p. 287); but he was
defeated and killed, and the Heraklids invaded the Peloponnese soon afterwards to
try to seize control of his kingdom and other territories too. It was the will of the
gods, however, that the Heraklids should not succeed in their aim until well after
the Trojan War, and they were either obliged to withdraw after an initial invasion
or were checked at the Isthmus of Corinth (see p. 288). The Mycenaeans for their
part were advised by an oracle that they should choose a member of a wholly different
family, the Pelopids, as their new ruler. So the kingdom passed to Atreus, son of
Pelops, and remained under Pelopid rule until his great-grandson Teisamenos 
was ousted by the Heraklids when they ﬁnally made their successful invasion (see
pp. 505ff). The interlude of Pelopid rule at Mycenae will be considered along with
other aspects of the history of that family in Chapter 14.

THE LIFE OF 
HERAKLES AND RETURN 
OF THE HERAKLIDS

THE BIRTH OF HERAKLES AND HIS EARLY 
LIFE AT THEBES
Alkmene arrives in Thebes with Alkmene, and mounts a 
campaign against the Teleboans
A
lthough Herakles was an Argive of Perseid stock by descent, he was born abroad
in Thebes after his putative father AMPHITRYON departed into exile with his
mother ALKMENE. As was described at the end of the last chapter, Amphitryon 
was exiled by his uncle Sthenelos for having killed another uncle, Elektryon, king 
of Mycenae (by accident in the usual account); and Alkmene, the daughter of
Elektryon, who was already betrothed to him, accompanied him to his new home, 
as did Likymnios, her only surviving brother. Her other brothers had all been 
killed by Teleboan raiders shortly before the death of her father (see p. 244 for the
circumstances). Kreon, the current ruler of Thebes, puriﬁed Amphitryon of the man-
slaughter and welcomed him to his city. Although Amphitryon now pressed
Alkmene to marry him (or to consummate their marriage if they were already
married), she declared that she would not accept him into her bed until he had
exacted vengeance on the Teleboans for the death of her brothers.1 So he made imme-
diate preparations for a campaign against the Teleboans, who lived in a group of
islands just outside the entrance of the Corinthian Gulf; and his forthcoming absence
would provide Zeus with an ideal opportunity to approach Alkmene to father his
great son Herakles.
When Amphitryon asked Kreon to assist him on the expedition, the king promised
to ﬁght as his ally if he would ﬁrst rescue the Thebans from the depredations of the
TEUMESSIAN FOX, a large and ferocious vixen which had established its lair on 
Mt Teumessos, about ﬁve miles north-east of Thebes; it had been sent by the gods 
to ravage the land and presented an exceptionally difﬁcult problem because it was
fated never to be caught. Knowing that Kephalos, son of Deion, owned a dog that
was fated always to catch its prey (see p. 372 for its origin), Amphitryon visited him
at his home in Attica, and asked him to allow it to be used against the fox in return
for a share of the spoils from the forthcoming war. Or in another version, Kephalos
CHAPTER EIGHT
246

was already in Thebes, having come there to be puriﬁed after accidentally killing his
wife Prokris, and had brought the dog with him. He agreed to Amphitryon’s request
in any case, and a paradoxical situation arose when a beast that was fated to catch its
prey was set in pursuit of another that was fated never to be caught. Zeus was obliged
to intervene, and resolved the problem very neatly by turning both animals to stone,
so that the dog never fails in the hunt and the fox is never caught.2 Or in a later
version from the astronomical literature that rather spoils the story, he turned the 
fox to stone but transferred the dog to the sky to become the constellation of the
Great Dog (Canis Major).3
After winning Kreon’s support by this means, Amphitryon collected together
further allies, including Kephalos, Panopeus (from Phocis, see p. 565) and Heleios,
the youngest son of Perseus,4 and sailed away with them to attack the Teleboans.
Although he ravaged most of their islands with little difﬁculty, he was initially
unable to capture Taphos, the island of PTERELAOS, the king of the Teleboans,
because Poseidon had implanted a golden hair in his head which rendered him
immortal as long as it remained in place. As we saw in the last chapter (see p. 244),
Pterelaos was descended from Poseidon, as his grandson in the usual account. The
assailants ﬁnally received help from an unexpected quarter when KOMAITHO, the
daughter of the king, fell in love with Amphitryon (or Kephalos in one account)
after seeing him at a distance, and tried to win his favour by pulling the magical
hair from her father’s head. When Pterelaos died as a consequence, Amphitryon was
able to complete his conquest; but instead of repaying Komaitho as she would have
wished, he killed her in horror at her unﬁlial act of treachery.5 For a very similar
story set in Megara, see p. 340.
The conception and birth of Herakles
As soon as the spoils had been gathered together, Amphitryon set sail for Boeotia,
eager to prove his success to his beloved and win his way into her bed. Shortly
before he arrived, however, Zeus forestalled him by assuming his guise to seduce
Alkmene. On being assured that vengeance had been executed against the Teleboans
as she had demanded, and receiving a magniﬁcent cup from the spoils by way of
proof, Alkmene welcomed the disguised god into her arms; and he extended the
time of their love-making by lengthening the night to three times its usual length.
Later in the same night or on the next night, her true husband arrived home to
report his triumph and so claim his promised reward. Surprised and disappointed
to ﬁnd that her welcome was none too passionate, he questioned her about the
matter; and when she protested that she had received him warmly enough a very
short time before, he consulted the seer Teiresias, who informed him of Zeus’s decep-
tion. He made love with her on that night all the same, and she became pregnant
with twin sons of contrasting nature, HERAKLES, a mighty hero and future god
as her child by Zeus, and IPHIKLES (or Iphiklos), a hero of no very exceptional
stature as her child by Amphitryon.6
It was not only on account of her beauty that Zeus set out to seduce Alkmene,
but also because he wanted to father a very great hero by her who would bring
beneﬁt to the human race, and even to the gods themselves by helping them in

their war against the Giants. He originally intended, furthermore, that this son of
his should be a mighty ruler in Argos, but this part of his plan was foiled by Hera.
As the story is recounted in the Iliad, Zeus boasted of his intentions to the other
gods, telling them that Eileithuia, the goddess of childbirth, would bring a man to
birth on that day who would be king over all who lived around him (i.e. in Argos),
and would be born from the race of those who came from Zeus’s blood (i.e. from
the Perseids, who were descended from Perseus, son of Zeus). By making this ill-
advised declaration, he alerted Hera, who resented all her husband’s illegitimate
children and immediately plotted to rob this one of his intended inheritance. She
happened to know that Alkmene was not the only woman who was expecting a
child of Perseid descent since the wife of Sthenelos, king of Mycenae, was also heavily
pregnant. So she persuaded Zeus to swear formally that the son of his stock who
would be born on that day would enjoy the destiny that he had announced; and
she then instructed the Eileithuiai (goddesses of childbirth) to delay Alkmene’s
delivery, while she herself hurried down from Olympos to ensure that the wife of
Sthenelos should bring her child to birth at once in the seventh month of her preg-
nancy. As a consequence, Eurystheus, the son of Sthenelos, was born on that day
instead of Herakles, and Zeus was therefore obliged by his oath to grant him 
the inheritance that he had been planning to grant to Herakles.7 This meant 
that Eurystheus became the great king of Mycenae (in succession to his father, see
p. 245), while Herakles never had a kingdom of his own. Herakles was therefore
destined to spend most of his life outside his ancestral homeland, and to be sub-
ordinate to Eurystheus even while he was there.
According to a tale ﬁrst recorded in the Hellenistic era, the birth of Herakles was ﬁnally expe-
dited through the ingenuity of a servant or friend of Alkmene. In the familiar version by 
Ovid, the goddess of childbirth, here appearing under her Latin name of Lucina, delayed the
hero’s birth by seven days and nights by sitting outside Alkmene’s bedroom door with 
her legs crossed and her ﬁngers intertwined (gestures of enclosure that would achieve their
effect by a form of sympathetic magic). Alkmene had a clever servant-maid, however, who
noticed the attitude of the goddess and recognized why she had adopted it. So this maid,
GALANTHIS, suddenly ran out to her and cried, ‘You must congratulate my mistress because
she has given birth to a child!’, prompting the goddess to leap up in astonishment and unlock
her ﬁngers and uncross her legs. The charm was undone as a consequence, and Herakles could
be born at last. Angered by the girl’s deception and by her subsequent laughter, the goddess
turned her into a weasel, a beast that runs around the house much as Galanthis had done as
a busy maidservant (for weasels – or more strictly, ferrets, i.e. domesticated polecats – were
kept in the house in antiquity to keep down pests, much like cats in modern times).8
Or in a Greek version ascribed to the Hellenistic poet Nicander, Galinthias, as she is
called here, was of high birth as a daughter of Proitos (a prominent Theban who gave his
name to the Proitidian gates of the city), and was thus a friend and former playmate of
Alkmene rather than a servant of hers. The story is much the same as in Ovid, except that
the Moirai (Fates) assisted the goddess of childbirth in her task, and it was they who turned
Galinthias into a weasel. This Greek account refers to an important matter, however, which
is passed over by Ovid, the cultic implications of the myth. For we are told that Hekate
made the weasel her attendant out of pity for Galinthias, and that Herakles later commem-
orated her services to him by erecting an altar to her outside his house at Thebes and offering
sacriﬁces on it, hence the sacriﬁces that the Thebans used to offer to Galinthias before their
— The life of Herakles —
248

festival of Herakles. It would seem that Galinthias was a heroine who had been honoured
at Thebes from an early period and that someone was inspired to devise this transformation
myth as an aetiology for the cult because her name was reminiscent of that of a weasel (galee¯
in Greek).9 Pausanias records another version of the deception story in which the Pharmakides
(Witches), the beings who were sent by Hera to delay the birth, were tricked by Historis,
a daughter of Teiresias; there is no mention here of any transformation.10
The childhood and education of Herakles, and his 
murder of Linos
When Herakles was eight or ten months old, or even newly born, two huge snakes
were sent by Hera to attack him and his half-brother in their cradle; but the infant
hero seized them by their necks, one in each hand, and choked them to death. In the
two fullest accounts of the episode by Pindar and Theocritus, the seer Teiresias was
summoned to comment on the marvel, and took this as an opportunity to foretell the
extraordinary destiny that lay in wait for Herakles, predicting that he would ﬁnally
be received among the gods after overcoming many such dangers.11 In an alternative
version, the snakes were not sent by the goddess but by Amphitryon, who introduced
them into the children’s cradle to enable him to discover which of them was his son;
when Herakles stayed to confront the snakes while Iphikles tried to escape, he recog-
nized at once that Herakles was the child with divine blood in him.12
A further tale of the hero’s infancy tells how Hera was deceived into suckling
him. In the most familiar version of the story, Hermes took the baby Herakles up
to Olympos and applied him to Hera’s breast while she was asleep (or without
revealing his true identity to her); and when she awoke (or learned who he was),

she pushed him away in such violent haste that some milk spilled out of her breast
to form the Milky Way. She conferred immortality on him by her involuntary action,
or the episode preﬁgured his future apotheosis at least.13
As would be expected, the hero’s education was traditionally said to have been
entrusted to the most celebrated experts. He learned the art of bowmanship from
Eurytos of Oichalia, who was a grandson of Apollo (see p. 412) and a skilled archer
like his divine ancestor, as were all the male members of his family. In one form of
his legend, indeed, Eurytos was eventually killed by Apollo because he dared to chal-
lenge the god to an archery contest; but it was more commonly said that he died at
the hand of his greatest pupil, Herakles himself (see p. 283). Autolykos instructed
Herakles in the art of wrestling; so great a trickster (see p. 431) was presumably a
past master of all the wiles of the ring. Herakles learned the art of chariot-driving
from his father, and the art of war from Kastor.14 Music was less to his taste, however,
and less suited to his natural abilities. His music-teacher, LINOS, became so exas-
perated by his slowness that he eventually lost patience and struck him, to the great
indignation of his young pupil, who struck back in anger with his lyre or plectrum,
with fatal effect. Although Herakles escaped prosecution by citing a law of the great
Cretan law-maker Rhadamanthys (see p. 351) that justiﬁed retaliation in self-defence,
his father decided that it would be prudent to cut his education short at this point,
and sent him out into the countryside to tend the family herds.15
There are three separate bodies of myth associated with musicians called Linos, the other
two relating to ﬁgures of that name who would have lived at an earlier period in mythical
history. The idea on which all these stories are founded, namely that there had once been
a young musician called Linos who had met a premature and pitiable death, was inspired
by the existence of an ancient reaping-song known as the ‘Linos-song’, which had a refrain
of ailinon which could be interpreted as meaning ‘alas for Linos!’ (although it was in fact a
word of foreign origin).
According to Argive tradition, Apollo fathered a son Linos by a princess of that land,
Psamathe, who was the daughter of an early Argive ruler called Krotopos. She sent the child
out to be exposed for fear of her father’s anger, but the shepherd who was supposed to
perform the task reared him as his own son instead, until the child happened to be torn
apart by his dogs. On hearing of this, Psamathe was so distressed that she told the whole
story to her father, who refused to believe that she had really borne the child to a god and
ordered that she should be put to death. When Argos was struck by a plague as a conse-
quence through the anger of Apollo, the citizens were advised by an oracle to appease the
dead mother and child, and achieved this by means of prayers and laments (hence the origin
of the Linos-song). Or in a rather different version, the infant Linos was torn apart by the
king’s sheep-dogs after he was exposed, and Apollo reacted by sending Poine (Vengeance
personiﬁed) against Argos. Poine snatched the children of the city from their mothers until
she was killed by a hero called Koroibos. When a plague broke out afterwards, Koroibos
visited the oracle of Apollo at Delphi to discover how he could atone for the killing, and
was instructed to take a tripod from the sanctuary and raise a temple to Apollo wherever
he ﬁrst dropped it. The tripod slipped from his hands on Mt Gerania in the Megarid; and
the tomb of Koroibos could be seen nearby at the market-place at Megara.16
A Boeotian tradition suggested that Linos was borne to a certain Amphimaros, son of
Poseidon, by the Muse Ourania. As beﬁtted the child of a Muse, he grew up to become the
ﬁnest of musicians, but soon provoked his own death at the hand of Apollo by claiming to
— The life of Herakles —
250

rival the god as a singer. When grief for his death then spread through the world, the Linos-
song was devised as a lament for him. This Linos, who is also described as a son of Apollo
himself, was said to have been buried at Thebes.17 As in the case of legendary musicians 
such as Orpheus and Mousaios, Linos’ name came to be attached to apocryphal poems in
historical times.
The lion of Kithairon, the daughters of Thespios, 
and a ﬁrst campaign
When Herakles reached the age of eighteen, he embarked on his ﬁrst adventure,
setting off to confront the lion of Kithairon, a ferocious beast that haunted the
mountain-range of that name on the southern borders of Boeotia. Since it was preying
not only on Amphitryon’s cattle but also on those of THESPIOS, the eponymous
ruler of Thespiai in south-western Boeotia, Herakles stayed at his court for ﬁfty
nights while trying to track the beast. Now the king had ﬁfty daughters, and he
was so impressed by the young hero’s strength that he wanted to ensure that each
of his daughters should conceive a child to him. He achieved this in one account
by introducing a different daughter into his bed each night, so that Herakles slept
with each in turn in the fond belief that he was sleeping with the same girl on each
occasion.18 Or in versions which savour more of folklore, Herakles enjoyed the
favours of all ﬁfty in seven nights, or of forty-nine of them in a single night.19 In
the latter account, one of them refused to have anything to do with him, and he
paid her back by forcing her to serve as his virgin priestess (a story that explained
why the temple of Herakles at Thespiai was served by a virgin priestess who
remained in that post until her death). This episode of the daughters of Thespios,
which has its comical side as so often with Herakles, has no inherent connection
with that of the lion-hunt. Diodorus tells it, indeed, as a separate story, stating that
Thespios invited the young Herakles to a sacriﬁce and feast for the speciﬁc purpose
of ensuring that all his daughters would bear children to him.20 Each of his daugh-
ters bore a son to Herakles in any case, apart from the eldest (and the youngest too
in one account) who bore him twins instead. The children were known as the THES-
PIADES after their grandfather. Herakles sent most of them to Sardinia when they
grew up to found a colony under the leadership of his nephew Iolaos, except for a
few who remained behind, seven at Thespiai and one or two at Thebes, to become
founders of noble families in the province of their birth.21 As for the myth of the
lion-hunt, it was cast wholly into the shade by the more diverting story of the
daughters of Thespios, and nothing is recorded of it beyond the fact that Herakles
eventually killed the beast.22
Apollodorus is exceptional in suggesting that Herakles took his lionskin cloak from this
lion; in other accounts, he took it from the Nemean lion (see p. 257), which was invulner-
able and would therefore have an impenetrable hide. According to a conﬂicting legend, the
lion of Kithairon was killed by Alkathoos, son of Pelops, rather than by Herakles (see further
on p. 567).23
As Herakles was travelling back from the hunt, he happened to run across some
heralds who had been sent by ERGINOS, king of Orchomenos, to collect an annual

tribute that the Thebans were obliged to pay to him. This tribute had come to 
be imposed on them in the following circumstances. Some years earlier, Klymenos,
the father of Erginos, had visited Onchestos, a town that lay between Orchomenos
(a powerful city in north-eastern Boeotia, see p. 558) and Thebes, to attend a festival
of Poseidon; and in the course of the celebrations, he had been murdered by some
Thebans as the result of some trivial quarrel, or had been fatally wounded by a stone
hurled by the charioteer of Kreon’s father Menoikeus. After hearing of his father’s
death (or after receiving a direct order from his dying father), Erginos had waged
a successful campaign against the Thebans, and had forced them to agree to send
him an annual tribute of a hundred cattle for twenty years. Herakles was so angered
by this imposition and by the arrogant behaviour of the heralds that he cut off their
noses, ears and hands, and hung them around their necks on cords, telling them to
take these to their king by way of tribute. Erginos responded by launching a second
expedition against Thebes; but Herakles was available to command the Thebans on
this occasion, and he soon killed Erginos and put his followers to ﬂight. He then
forced the Orchomenians to pay tribute to the Thebans, demanding that they should
send twice as much as they had been receiving.24
In a Hellenistic account recorded by Diodorus, Erginos had taken precautions against a future
revolt by depriving the Thebans of their weapons. So when he demanded that Herakles
should be surrendered for having assaulted his heralds, Kreon was ready to yield to his
superior power. Herakles procured arms for the Thebans, however, by stripping their temples
of all the weapons that had been dedicated in them, and persuaded the young men of the
city to strike for their freedom. On hearing that Erginos was advancing against the city,
Herakles attacked him and his troops on narrow ground to deprive him of the advantage of
his superior numbers, and killed him along with much of his army. He was then able to
attack Orchomenos unexpectedly and burn it to the ground.25 Some said that he destroyed
the power of Orchomenos forever (see further on p. 558)
Herakles founds a family in Thebes with Megara, but kills 
their children in a ﬁt of madness
Kreon rewarded Herakles for his services in the war by granting him his daughter
MEGARA as a wife. He lived happily with her at Thebes for some years, fathering
several children by her (from two to eight in varying accounts), until Hera ﬁnally
intervened by inspiring him with a ﬁt of homicidal madness. While in this state,
he murdered his children, either by throwing them into a ﬁre or by shooting them
down with his arrows; and in some accounts, he also killed some or all of the chil-
dren of his half-brother Iphikles. Apollodorus follows Pherecydes in stating that he
threw his children into a ﬁre, and adds that he inﬂicted the same fate on two chil-
dren of Iphikles.26 Or in Diodorus’ version, he ﬁrst tried to kill his nephew Iolaos,
but shot his own children when Iolaos managed to escape.27 Or in another account
by Nicolaus of Damascus (a writer associated with the court of Herod the Great),
Herakles killed two of the children of Iphikles and then his own children, tearing
the last from his mother’s breast; and he would have killed Megara too if she had
not been rescued by Iphikles, who also saved his own eldest son Iolaos.28 According
to a local tradition at Thebes, Herakles would have killed his aged father too, an
— The life of Herakles —
252

even graver crime in Greek eyes, if it had not been for the prompt action of Athena,
who stunned him by hurling a stone at him; this stone, which was known as the
so¯phroniste¯r (i.e. stone of wisdom or restraint), could be seen in the city in historical
times.29
Megara is mentioned in the Odyssey among the famous women of earlier times who were
seen by Odysseus in the Underworld; the poet tells us nothing about her except that she
was a daughter of Kreon and the wife of Herakles.30 This story of the murder of her chil-
dren was recounted by Stesichorus in the ﬁrst half of the sixth century BC.31 In referring to
the cult of the eight dead sons of Herakles at the Elektran gates of Thebes, Pindar calls
them bronze-armoured (or -armed, chalkoarai),32 which would imply that they were grown
up at the time of their death. The poet or his source may have altered the story to make it
less shameful for Herakles, by representing his victims as having been more than defence-
less children.
According to Apollodorus, Kreon offered his younger daughter to Iphikles at the same
time as he offered Megara to Herakles; but Iphikles had already fathered his only signiﬁ-
cant son, Iolaos, by a previous wife, Automedousa, daughter of Alkathoos.33
In his surviving play on the episode, the Madness of Herakles, Euripides provides a peculiar
account apparently of his own devising. While Herakles was away fetching Kerberos from
Hades as his ﬁnal labour, a certain Lykos (who was descended from the famous Lykos whose
Theban career will be described in Chapter 9) killed Kreon to seize power at Thebes; and
Megara found herself under threat, and sought refuge at the altar of Zeus with her children.
On returning to ﬁnd that Lykos had been planning to burn them to death, Herakles came to
their rescue and killed the usurper; but was then driven mad by Hera, who sent Lyssa (Manic
Fury personiﬁed) against him, causing him to slaughter his wife and children. Having heard
rumours that Herakles was under threat from Lykos, Theseus arrived at Thebes after the hero
had returned to his senses, and invited him back to Athens to be puriﬁed.
Herakles is instructed to perform twelve labours 
for Eurystheus
When Herakles recovered his sanity and realized what he had done, he went into
voluntary exile, ﬁrst visiting his former host Thespios, who agreed to purify him in
accordance with the formal demands of Greek religion; and he then went to Delphi
to ask where he should settle in the future. The Pythian priestess told him to go
to Tiryns in the Argolid, where he was to live for ten years while he performed a
series of labours that would be imposed on him by Eurystheus, king of Mycenae;
and at the same time, she was able to give him the more welcome message that he
would win immortality as the fruit of his toils and humiliations.34 Or in the version
offered by Nicolaus of Damascus, Eurystheus invited him to come to Tiryns when
he went into exile, and he accepted the offer, remembering that Amphitryon had
once received an oracle saying that Herakles would have to serve Eurystheus and
would win glory as a result.35 Or in Diodorus’ account, Eurystheus had summoned
him to perform the labours before his madness, but he had paid no attention until
Zeus had let him know by some means that he would have to do so; he had then
consulted the Delphic oracle, which gave him the same message as in the initial
account above; and while he was still pondering on the matter (for he was under-
standably depressed at the thought that he would be subjected to a man who was

much inferior to him), Hera sent him mad, causing him to kill his children, and
he ﬁnally embarked on his labours after a long period of mourning.36
It was sometimes claimed that the priestess at Delphi ﬁrst gave the hero his name of Herakles
when telling him of his forthcoming labours, and that he had originally been named Alkaios
(or Alkeides) after his putative grandfather; in that case, Apollo is supposed to have given
him the name Herakles because he would win imperishable glory, kleos, by doing favours,
era, to men, i.e. through his labours (ρα γρ νθρπ
ισι φρων κλ
ς φθιτ
ν !"εις).37
It is certainly true that his name, which really means ‘Glory of Hera’, seems inappropriate
for a hero who received nothing but hostility from Hera (at least until his apotheosis). Other
mythographers devised varied explanations, suggesting, for instance, that the Argives
conferred the name on him after his ﬁrst exploit in strangling the pair of snakes as a baby,
to indicate that he had gained glory, kleos, through Hera (who had sent the snakes with the
intention of killing him!).38
THE LABOURS OF HERAKLES
The cycle of labours
At some stage in the development of the mythology of Herakles, perhaps as late as
the ﬁfth century BC, a canonic list came to be established of the tasks that he was
supposed to have performed for Eurystheus. These were known to the Greeks as the
athloi, a term generally rendered as labores in Latin, hence our modern expression,
‘the labours’, although neither of these translations quite catches the ﬂavour of the
original; an athlos was literally a contest, especially for a prize, and by extension a
struggle or ordeal that involves toil and trouble. The term could therefore be applied
most appropriately to describe the arduous tasks that were performed by Herakles
for Eurystheus, all the more so since he was thought to have won immortality as
the ultimate reward for his labours. Homer already uses the word (though not as
yet with the latter suggestion) when referring to the harsh labours, chalepous aethlous,
that were imposed on the hero by Eurystheus.39 There is no reason to suppose,
however, that Homer knew of any ordered cycle of labours. Although some of the
exploits that were later included in the canonic cycle are recorded as early as the
eighth century BC in works of art, and all but one – the clearing of the Augeian
stables – are attested by the sixth century, it is not known when they came to be
classed together as the cycle of labours that he performed for Eurystheus. The full
canonic sequence ﬁrst appears in a series of carvings for the metopes for the temple
of Zeus at Olympia, which can be dated to c. 460 BC. Some have argued that these
sculptures played a decisive role in establishing the canonic list, and that the stan-
dard number was thus determined by architectural considerations; or else the
sequence may have imposed itself through an earlier epic account, perhaps in the
Herakleia of Herodotus’ uncle Panyasis; but this remains a matter for conjecture.
According to a classiﬁcation that was devised by the early Greek mythographers,
the exploits of Herakles could be divided into three main classes. These athloi, or
labours, were distinguished on the one hand from the parerga, or incidentals, the
chance adventures that befell the hero while he was performing his labours, and on
— The life of Herakles —
254

the other hand from the praxeis or deeds, the major exploits that he performed of
his own accord without orders from another. Artiﬁcial though it may have been,
this scheme proved most convenient in enabling the mythographers to bring some
sort of order into the mass of Herakleian myth. Legends that were located in areas
associated with the labours could be bracketed with the appropriate labour as parerga,
even if they had no original connection with them; and the other main deeds of the
hero (apart from one or two youthful deeds set in Boeotia) could be relegated to
the period after his labours as his various praxeis. We will now follow the labours
with their associated parerga before passing on to the other adventures that were
relegated in this way to the latter part of Herakles’ life.
While performing his labours, Herakles received his orders from Eurystheus at
Mycenae but lived elsewhere, basing himself at the ancient citadel of Tiryns to the
south. He was accompanied to the Argolid by his nephew Iolaos, who assisted him
in his labours as his charioteer, and also his half-brother Iphikles; but Megara
remained at Thebes until Herakles visited her after his labours to settle his marital
affairs (see p. 272).
Convenient summaries of the labours are provided by Diodorus and Apollodorus.40
In the following account, we will consider them in the order in which they are
narrated by Diodorus, although other lists or narratives show some slight variation
in this respect; in particular, Herakles’ journey to the Underworld to fetch Kerberos,
which could certainly be regarded as his most daunting enterprise, was sometimes
classed as his ﬁnal labour rather than as his penultimate labour as below. The labours
fall neatly into two groups of six, for the ﬁrst six are set in the northern Peloponnese
no great distance from Mycenae, while the ﬁnal six take the hero further abroad,
initially to Crete, Thrace and Asia Minor, and ultimately to the edges of the earth
and the world below.
According to a tradition mentioned by Apollodorus alone, the priestess at Delphi originally
told the hero that he would have to perform ten labours over twelve years, but he was
obliged to perform twelve labours in the end because Eurystheus refused to acknowledge
two of them, objecting that Iolaos had helped him to kill the hydra (see below) and that
he had sought a fee from Augeias for clearing the Augeian stables.41
Amphitryon was usually thought to have died before the time of Herakles’ labours; Apollo-
dorus states that he was killed while ﬁghting bravely alongside Herakles in the war against
Orchomenos.42 He was sometimes introduced into the story of Herakles’ madness, however,
as in the local tradition mentioned above in which he was saved by Athena, or in Euripides’
surviving play on the matter (in which he came under threat from Lykos along with Herakles’
wife and children).43 Only a single exploit is recorded for him from his latter years at Thebes,
his defeat of Chalkodon of Euboea (see p. 520), who was killed by him in a battle near Thebes
when he tried to exact a tribute from the Thebans.44
Alkmene was sometimes said to have married the Cretan hero Rhadamanthys after Amphi-
tryon’s death (see p. 352); she lived to a great age, surviving to share the troubles of the
Heraklids after her son’s death (see p. 287). As for her brother Likymnios, when he had accom-
panied her to Thebes, he married Amphitryon’s sister Perimede, who bore him three sons,
ﬁrst Oionos, whose subsequent murder would cause Herakles to conduct a campaign against
Sparta (see p. 279), and then Argeias and Melas, who would be killed during Herakles’ ﬁnal
campaign (see p. 283). The only signiﬁcant tale recorded for Likymnios himself is the story
of his death (see p. 293).

First labour: the Nemean Lion
As his ﬁrst labour, Herakles was ordered to kill the monstrous Nemean lion that
lived in the mountains near Nemea in the north-western corner of the Argolid.
According to Hesiod, it was the offspring of Orthos and Chimaira (or possibly
Echidna, see p. 63), and was reared by Hera, who caused it to roam the hills of
Nemea, evidently with the intention of providing an ordeal for Herakles.45 Or in
another tradition, it was a child of the moon-goddess Selene (or was at least born
on the moon), and lived on the moon until Selene cast it down to the earth with
a fearsome shudder at the request of Hera.46 It was especially formidable because it
was invulnerable (except perhaps in the earliest tradition, for images from the visual
arts suggest that there may once have been a version in which it could be killed
with a sword). Although Herakles soon discovered that its hide was impenetrable
to his arrows and sword, he was able to use his club and indeed his bare hands to
greater advantage. In the standard later version, he struck fear into it by threat-
ening it with his club, causing it to ﬂee back to its lair, a two-mouthed cave on
Mt Tretos (Perforated Mountain) near Nemea; and he then blocked up one mouth
of the cave before entering through the other to seize it by its neck and strangle
it.47 Or in another account, he stunned the lion by battering it with his club at
their ﬁrst meeting, and then strangled it in the open air.48

After killing the lion, Herakles stripped it of its hide to provide himself with his
familiar costume, which offered him excellent protection because it was impenetrable
to any weapon. According to Theocritus, he was at a loss as to how he could cut
it until some god inspired him with the thought that it might at least be pene-
trable to the lion’s own claws.49 Although Apollodorus states that he was merely
ordered to fetch the animal’s skin, he is usually said to have carried the lion itself
to Eurystheus as proof of its death (as Apollodorus indeed describes him as doing
later in his own narrative).50 Eurystheus was so alarmed by the sight of it that he
refused to allow Herakles into Mycenae from that time onwards, telling him to
exhibit his trophies at the city gates. For further security, the cowardly king ordered
that a bronze jar should be buried in the earth for him to hide in when Herakles
arrived with his more fearsome trophies, such as Kerberos or the Erymanthian boar;
and he issued his orders through an intermediary henceforth, the herald Kopreus
(Dung-man), who is already mentioned in this connection in the Iliad.51
In the earliest tradition, Herakles wore metallic armour like any other warrior. He is ﬁrst
shown wearing a lionskin in works of art dating from the latter part of the seventh century
BC, and it is not until the second half of the sixth century that the lionskin becomes his
standard form of dress in Attic vase-painting.52 Pindar and Bacchylides in the following
century are the ﬁrst authors to indicate that the hide was impenetrable.53 By looking out
through the jaw-space, the hero could use the beast’s scalp as a sort of helmet. Apollodorus
alone suggests that he cut his lionskin from the lion of Kithairon (see p. 251).54
Herakles was said to have cut his club from a wild olive-tree at Nemea or on the east
coast of the Argolid before setting out against the lion;55 or according to Theocritus, he
acquired it on Mt Helikon in Boeotia by pulling up an entire olive-tree.56 We hear else-
where of a bronze or bronze-tipped club; this may have been the club that he was said to
have received from Hephaistos.57 His more conventional arms and armour were presented
to him by various gods as a rewards for his prowess, either after he ﬁrst demonstrated it by
defeating the Orchomenians or after he completed the ﬁrst ﬁve of his labours; according to
Apollodorus, Hermes gave him a sword, Apollo a bow and arrow, Hephaistos a golden
cuirass, and Athena a mantle.58
Before confronting the Nemean lion, Herakles called in at Kleonai, a town not far from
Nemea, and stayed with a poor labourer called MOLORCHOS, whose son had been killed 
by the lion. Molorchos wanted to sacriﬁce a ram in honour of his guest, but Herakles told 
him to wait for thirty days and then make a sacriﬁce, offering it to Zeus the Saviour if he 
had returned safely from the hunt or else to himself as a hero if he were killed during the
hunt. Gods and dead heroes were both honoured in Greek cult, the latter with distinctive
chthonic rites. After pursuing the lion for twenty-eight days, Herakles killed it on the twenty-
ninth day, but promptly fell asleep from exhaustion; on awakening, he hoisted the lion onto
his shoulders and hurried back with it to Molorchos, hastily plucking some wild parsley
(selinon) to make a crown for the sacriﬁce. He arrived back just in time to prevent Molorchos
from making the sacriﬁce to him as a dead hero. Before departing on his way, Herakles re-
organized the Nemean Games (which had been founded by Adrastos and the Seven, see 
p. 318) as a festival in honour of Zeus; it was claimed that the victors were awarded a crown
of wild parsley because the hero had worn one at the above-mentioned sacriﬁce to Zeus. A
version of this tale was recounted by Callimachus, who is the earliest author who is known 
to have mentioned it.59 In astral mythology, Hera was said to have rewarded the lion by 
transferring it to the heavens to become the constellation of the Lion (Leo).60

Second labour: the Lernaian Hydra
This was a huge many-headed snake that lived in the swamps of Lerna some miles
to the south of Argos. According to the Theogony, it was the offspring of Typhon
and Echidna, and it was reared by Hera to become a danger to Herakles;61 although
Hesiod offers no description, it is regularly described as many-headed in subsequent
accounts and is shown as such in visual images from the eighth century BC onwards.
As for the number of its heads, estimates vary from just a few to as many as ﬁfty
or a hundred.62 For obvious practical reasons, artists tend to portray it with rela-
tively few heads. It was often said to have been exceptionally difﬁcult to kill because
as soon as one head was cut off, a new head, or more commonly two, would grow
up in its place.63 Hydra, which simply means water-snake, is not a proper name in
Greek and does not necessarily carry any connotation of monstrosity.
After travelling to Lerna in his chariot with Iolaos, Herakles engaged with this
formidable adversary, but soon found himself in difﬁculties because its heads regrew
as quickly as he cut them off (or knocked them off with his club). To make matters
worse, Hera provided it with an ally by sending an enormous crab to bite Herakles
on the foot. He managed to kill the crab, however, by crushing it underfoot, and
now felt that he was justiﬁed in calling on the help of Iolaos as an ally of his own.
So Iolaos prepared some ﬁrebrands, and whenever Herakles cut off one of the 
hydra’s heads, he would assist him by cauterizing the stump to prevent a new head
(or heads) from growing. After removing its heads in this manner and killing it,
Herakles dipped his arrows into its blood or gall, making them so poisonous from
that time onward that the merest scratch would prove fatal. According to Apollo-
dorus at least, one of its heads (here nine in number) was immortal, and the hero
was therefore obliged to bury it under a heavy rock.64 Some said that Herakles called
on the help of Iolaos while under joint attack from the hydra and the crab, hence
the origin of the proverb ‘Even Herakles cannot ﬁght against two’.65 In astral myth-
ology, Hera is said to have honoured the crab by transferring it to the heavens to
become the constellation of the Crab (Cancer).66
Third labour: the Erymanthian Boar
This is perhaps the least interesting of all the adventures, even if it inspired some
memorable images from Attic vase-painters, who liked to show Eurystheus cowering
in his bronze jar as Herakles displays the boar to him. This beast, which was neither
of divine origin nor gifted with any special powers, lived on Mt Erymanthos in north-
western Arcadia and used to venture down to ravage the lands beneath. Having been
ordered to capture it alive, Herakles frightened it out of its lair with loud shouts (or
well-aimed stones) and chased it into deep snow, where he was able to net it. He then
carried it back to Mycenae on his shoulders, which was quite a feat in itself.67
While seeking the boar, he visited the Centaur PHOLOS, who lived in a cave on
Mt Pholoe to the south of Mt Erymanthos. Pholos set roast meat before him while
eating his own meat raw (an indication of his semi-animal status); but he hesitated
to offer any wine to his guest because the wine-jar in his cave belonged to all the
Centaurs in common. Herakles insisted nevertheless and opened it up, to the anger
— The life of Herakles —
258

of the other Centaurs, who soon detected the smell of the wine and arrived at the
cave armed with rocks and ﬁr-trees. In another account, Dionysos had left the jar
with a Centaur four generations earlier, ordering that it should not be opened 
until Herakles arrived there as a visitor; and when it was duly opened for Herakles
by Pholos, the Centaurs of the area were thrown into such a frenzy by the scent of
the ancient wine that they attacked the cave. A ﬁght developed in any case between
the Centaurs and the hero, who shot some of them on the spot and put the others
to ﬂight. They sought refuge with Cheiron, who was then living at Cape Malea at
the south-eastern tip of the Peloponnese, having been expelled from Mt Pelion 
by the Lapiths. As they were cowering around the noble Centaur, Herakles, who
had pursued them all the way, shot an arrow at them and accidentally struck 
Cheiron in the knee. Since the painful wound was rendered incurable by the viru-
lent poison on Herakles’ arrow (which had come from the hydra’s venom), Cheiron
was later happy to surrender his immortality as the price for Prometheus’ release
(see p. 271). Herakles returned to Mt Pholoe to ﬁnd that his host Pholos had met
his death in the mean time. For while he had been examining one of Herakles’
poisoned arrows, he had accidentally dropped it onto his own foot; or else he had
cut himself with an arrow as he was drawing it from the body of a fallen Centaur
to prepare him for burial.68
The Centaurs were primarily associated with northern Thessaly; it was said that they took
refuge in Arcadia after they were driven out of their original homeland by Peirithoos and the
Lapiths (see p. 555). Of those who survived the present confrontation with Herakles, Nessos
settled on the river Euenos in Aetolia (see p. 281) while others were received at Eleusis by
Poseidon, who hid them under a mountain. Herakles killed another Centaur, Eurytion, while
visiting Dexamenos (the Hospitable), king of Olenos in Achaea, after clearing the Augeian
stables; for Eurytion had forced the king to allow him to marry his daughter, and Herakles
shot him when he arrived to claim her. Or in another version, Herakles killed him when he
tried to rape the king’s daughter at her wedding-feast (see p. 549).69 Cheiron and Pholos were
of nobler character than the other Centaurs, and of higher birth (see p. 555).
Fourth labour: the Cerynitian Hind
The golden-horned Cerynitian (or Ceryneian) hind, which was sacred to Artemis,
lived by the river Kerynites (or on Mt Keryneia) in north-eastern Arcadia. Herakles
was ordered to capture it alive; and since it was a sacred beast, it would be improper
for him to cause it even the slightest harm. According to Apollodorus, he chased
it through Arcadia for an entire year until he ﬁnally brought it to the ground with
a skilful arrow-shot (evidently without injuring it) as it was about to cross the river
Ladon. As he was carrying it to Mycenae on his shoulders, he ran across Artemis
and her brother Apollo. She reproached him for having tried to kill her sacred beast,
and wanted to take it away from him, but was appeased by his explanations and
allowed him to pass on his way.70 After showing the hind to Eurystheus, he set it
free unharmed. Diodorus records various other ways in which he was said to have
captured it, whether by the use of nets, or by tracking it down until he was able
to surprise it in its sleep, or by running it down until it grew exhausted.71 Although
the chase was conﬁned to the central Peloponnese in the usual account, Pindar offers

— The life of Herakles —
259

a more extravagant version in which Herakles pursued the beast from Arcadia to
the banks of the Istros (Danube) and thence to the mythical northern land of the
Hyperboreans.72
Pindar remarks that Taygete (the eponym of Mt Taygetos on the western borders of Laconia,
named elsewhere as a daughter of Atlas) had dedicated the hind to Artemis, and had inscribed
it with the name of the goddess. According to the poet’s ancient commentators, Artemis
had once turned Taygete into a hind to save her from being raped by Zeus, and Taygete
had shown her gratitude afterwards by dedicating the present hind to her rescuer.73 There
is no way of telling, however, whether this was a genuinely ancient story or simply a tale
that was invented by some mythographer to account for Pindar’s allusion. Whatever its
origin, it is not easily reconciled with the commonly accepted tradition in which Taygete
bore the founder of the Spartan royal line to Zeus (see p. 524). Callimachus offers a different
account of the origin of the hind, saying that ﬁve such beasts, as large as bulls, had once
lived at Parrhasia in southern Arcadia, where they had been seen by Artemis, who had
captured four of them to draw her chariot; but Hera ensured that the ﬁfth should escape to
Mt Keryneia to provide a labour for Herakles in the future.74 Although Euripides claims
that it was a dangerous beast that caused trouble to the local people, this formed no part
of the original tradition; as Diodorus observes, this was a labour that was to be achieved by
ingenuity, without involving danger or the use of force.75
Fifth labour: the Stymphalian Birds
The thickly wooded shores of the Stymphalian Lake in north-eastern Arcadia
provided a perfect habitat for huge ﬂocks of birds. As his next labour, Herakles was
ordered to drive them all away. The birds were not dangerous in the original story;
they look rather like geese in vase-paintings, with short bodies and long necks. They
could be expected to present a problem to Herakles simply because there were so
many of them. In literary accounts, the hero frightened the birds out of their coverts
by creating a din with a bronze rattle or castanets, and then shot them down with
his arrows as they rose up into the air. Or in an early version by the epic poet
Pisander of Rhodes, he merely frightened them away without killing them. There
was disagreement on whether he made the bird-scarer himself or received it as a
gift from Athena, who had acquired it from Hephaistos. It makes no appearance in
vase-paintings and other visual images, which simply show the hero shooting the
birds with his arrows, or attacking them with his club, or a sling, or indeed his
bare hands.76 By mentioning the Stymphalian birds in connection with the birds of
the island of Ares in the Black Sea, which could shoot out their feathers like arrows
(see p. 389), Apollonius was indirectly responsible for some late reports which
attribute this capacity to the Arcadian birds.77 Pausanias is certainly following a
late tradition when he describes them as man-eaters, and compares them to some
alarming Arabian birds that could peck through armour of bronze or iron.78
Sixth labour: the Augeian Stables
AUGEIAS, son of Helios (the Sun), who ruled at Elis in the north-western
Peloponnese, was the proud owner of vast herds of cattle (which had been presented
— The life of Herakles —
260

by his divine father in some accounts). Since their stables, or more accurately, enclo-
sures, had been left uncleared, an enormous quantity of dung had accumulated, and
Herakles was now ordered to clear it away in a single day. Before setting to work,
he negotiated a fee of a tenth of the land with Augeias, who was happy to promise
it because he believed that Herakles would not be able to complete the task in full.
Rather than attempting to achieve it by hand, however, which would doubtless have
been as impractical as it was humiliating, Herakles resorted to his wits and washed
the dung away by diverting a river (or rivers) through the enclosures. In differing
accounts, he rechannelled the Peneios and Alpheios, the two main rivers of the area,
for this purpose, or else the Alpheios alone, or the Manios, a tributary of the Alpheios
that ran through the city of Elis. Herakles returned to Augeias in triumph to claim
his fee, only to ﬁnd that the king had discovered that he was acting under orders
from Eurystheus, and was unwilling to pay him for work that he would have had
to perform in any case. According to Apollodorus, Augeias even denied that he had
ever promised him a reward, and declared that he would be ready to submit to arbi-
tration on the point; but when the matter was brought before the tribunal, Augeias’
own son, Phyleus, offered evidence on behalf of Herakles, attesting that a reward
had indeed been offered. Augeias was so furious that he expelled Herakles from the
kingdom along with Phyleus before the votes could be counted. Homer may have
been acquainted with this story, in some form at least, since he mentions that
Phyleus went into exile after quarrelling with his father. When Herakles later
returned to Elis to avenge the slight, he killed Augeias and invited Phyleus to take
over the kingdom (see pp. 277–8).79
A comical tale of an eating-contest came to be attached to this labour. When Herakles tried
to claim his reward for clearing the stables, a certain LEPREOS (the eponym of Eleian town
of Lepreon or Lepreos) advised Augeias to throw him into chains. Herakles was aggrieved
by the insult and later visited the home of Lepreos to confront him, but agreed to make
friends with him at the urging of his mother, and then competed with him in a series of
contests, in throwing the discus, in bailing out water, and in seeing who could consume a
whole ox in the shortest time. Lepreos was inevitably defeated every time, and when he was
defeated once again in a drinking-contest, he lost his temper and provoked his own death
by challenging Herakles to single combat.80 Or in another version, Lepreos was able to
match Herakles in gluttony in an ox-eating contest, and became over-conﬁdent as a result
and dared to challenge him to a duel.81
Seventh labour: the Cretan Bull
According to the usual tradition, this was the bull that had been sent up from the
sea by Poseidon in response to the prayers of Minos, but had later been turned wild
by the god after Minos had failed to sacriﬁce it to him (see p. 338); in that case,
it should certainly have been exceptionally difﬁcult to capture. Or in a divergent
account by the early Argive mythographer Acusilaus,82 it was the bull that had
carried Europa to Crete (see p. 337; usually regarded as having been Zeus himself
in animal form). Herakles was ordered to bring it back alive. Although Diodorus
states that he was helped in the enterprise by Minos, Apollodorus says quite the
opposite, stating that he sought the help of Minos but was told to tackle the beast

on his own. For information on how he was supposed to have achieved this, we have
to rely on vase-paintings, which indicate that he wrestled the bull to its knees and
hobbled it. Diodorus reports that he rode through the sea to the Peloponnese on
its back. He showed it to Eurystheus and then let it go; it wandered about for some
time, ﬁnally taking up residence at Marathon in northern Attica, where it was subse-
quently killed by Theseus (see p. 344).83 Or in some Latin accounts, Herakles killed
it, or Eurystheus was tactless enough to dedicate it to Hera, who drove it away to
Attica because it witnessed to the glory of Herakles.84
Eighth labour: the Horses of Diomedes
As his next labour, Herakles was sent north to fetch the savage horses of DIO-
MEDES, son of Ares, the king of the Bistones in Thrace. The four horses in question,
which would have formed Diomedes’ chariot-team, were fed on human ﬂesh; they
are commonly described as mares (even if Hyginus, the only author to name them,
happens to give them masculine names, Podargos, Lampon, Xanthos and Dinos).85
In what was probably the oldest form of the story, as attested by Pindar and
Euripides, the hero achieved the task on his own. Although the relevant fragment
from Pindar is poorly preserved, it would seem that Herakles threw some unfortu-
nate person to the horses to distract them while he was harnessing them; and
Diomedes was apparently killed while trying to oppose him. Euripides refers to the
blood-caked stables of the horses, and mentions that Herakles tamed them and 
drove them back to Mycenae in a four-horse chariot.86 Herakles seems to have been
unaccompanied in Diodorus’ account also. After reporting that the horses’ feeding-
troughs were made from bronze and that the animals were fastened to them by iron
chains, Diodorus explains that Herakles tamed them by throwing their own master
to them; for he rendered them docile by feeding them on the ﬂesh of the man who
had taught them their unnatural practices.87
In the other main version of the story, as recounted by Apollodorus, Herakles
sailed to Thrace with a company of volunteers, also taking his young favourite
ABDEROS, who was a son of Hermes from Opous in Eastern Locris. After over-
powering the men who were in charge of the stables, Herakles seized the mares and
led them down towards the sea; but Diomedes and his followers came to recover
them before he could sail away, and he left them in the charge of Abderos while
he was confronting the enemy force. He soon killed Diomedes and put the Bistonians
to ﬂight, but returned to ﬁnd that Abderos had been killed by the horses in the
mean time. So he buried him at the spot and founded the city of Abdera in his
memory (on the northern coast of the Aegean about halfway between the Chalcidice
and the Hellespont). He then took the horses to Eurystheus, who set them free.88
They wandered north toward their homeland until they arrived at Mt Olympos
where they were torn apart by wild beasts; or according to Diodorus, Eurystheus
dedicated them to Hera and their breed persisted until the time of Alexander the
Great.89 Ovid and Hyginus state that Herakles slaughtered them,90 but this was
evidently a late development. It was during his journey to Thrace that Herakles
rescued Alkestis from death in Euripides’ account of her story (see p. 152).

Ninth labour: the Belt of Hippolyte
As his next labour, Herakles went to the land of the Amazons to fetch the belt or
‘girdle’ of their queen, HIPPOLYTE. This was a heavy warrior’s belt (zo¯ste¯r) rather
than the light girdle that would have formed part of the ordinary clothing of women;
Apollodorus calls it the belt of Ares and indicates that it was a symbol of Hippolyte’s
sovereignty.91 Although the same author goes on to explain that Eurystheus sent
for it because his daughter Admete wanted to acquire it, such an object would have
been desirable in itself and well-suited to serve as a token of success, and it need
not be assumed that any such explanation would have been offered or required in
the early tradition. According to Euripides, the belt was deposited at Mycenae,
presumably at the Heraion, along with a gold-spangled robe that had belonged to
the queen.92
The land of the Amazons was usually thought to lie on the southern shores of
the Black Sea, in the north-eastern corner of Asia Minor; after having undertaken
labours in the south and north, Herakles now set out for the east. In the simplest
version of the story, as found in Apollonius, he gained the belt on his own and
without bloodshed, by capturing the queen’s sister MELANIPPE in an ambush and
then ransoming her in exchange for the belt. It seems to have been commonly
believed, however, that he sailed to the area with a force of allies, and engaged the
Amazons in a battle at which he either seized the belt or captured the enemy
commander, Melanippe, to ransom her for the belt.93 The battle is a very popular

subject in vase-paintings from the ﬁrst half of the sixth century BC onwards (although
there is no indication that a belt plays any special part in the story, and the speciﬁc
opponent of Herakles is generally a certain Andromache, if any name is marked).
Theseus was sometimes said to have accompanied Herakles as one of his allies 
(see p. 357).94
Apollodorus offers a distinctive account of this labour, saying that Hippolyte
visited Herakles’ ship to enquire about the reason for his visit after he called in at
Themiskyra, the main city of the Amazons on the river Thermodon. She promised
to give him the belt, and the matter might have been settled amicably if it had
not been for the machinations of Hera, who mingled with Hippolyte’s followers in
the guise of an Amazon and told them that their queen was being abducted. They
rode down to the ship fully armed as a consequence, causing Herakles to believe
that treachery was afoot. So he killed Hippolyte, stripped her of the belt, and
confronted the Amazons in battle before sailing off with his trophy.95
While sailing to (or from) this labour, Herakles saved Hesione, the daughter 
of the king of Troy, from being devoured by a sea-monster; but her father Laomedon
refused to pay him the promised reward, and he returned to Troy after the comple-
tion of his labours to exact a devastating revenge (see p. 275). Apollodorus may be
consulted for various minor episodes that came to be associated with Herakles’
voyage.
Tenth labour: the Cattle of Geryon
The monstrous GERYON (or Geryoneus, or Geryones), who was three men joined
into one, has already been mentioned as a child of Chrysaor (see p. 62); Herakles
was ordered to fetch his cattle from his home-island of Erytheia (Red Island), which
lay in the outer Ocean toward the sunset in the far west. The hero travelled out
through North Africa, killing many wild beasts on the way to prepare the area for
human settlement. As he was approaching the western bounds of Africa, he became
exasperated by the heat of the sun and aimed his bow threateningly at the sun-god
Helios, who was so impressed by his audacity that he offered him the use of his
golden cup to take him across the Ocean to Erytheia.96 This was the remarkable
vessel in which Helios used to travel around the Ocean each night from the place
of his setting to that of his rising (see p. 43). So Herakles took the cup from Okeanos
or from the sea-god Nereus,97 evidently during the daytime while Helios was not
using it, and reached Erytheia with greater ease than he might have expected.
According to Pherecydes, Okeanos tried to test his nerve by raising a heavy swell,
but gave up in alarm when the hero threatened him with his bow.98
On reaching Erytheia (which originally lay in a purely fabulous realm, but was
later thought to lie somewhere off the coast of southern Spain), Herakles set up
camp on a mountain and awaited an opportunity to steal the cattle, which were
purple in colour and were guarded by the herdsman Eurytion and the monstrous
dog Orthos or Orthros (see p. 62), which had two or more heads. The dog soon
detected the presence of the stranger and rushed to the attack, but was clubbed to
death by Herakles, who also killed Eurytion when he came to the aid of the beast.
— The life of Herakles —
264

On learning of the disturbance from Menoitios, who was pasturing the cattle of
Hades on the island, Geryon set off in search of Herakles and found him driving
the cattle away along the side of a river; and a ﬁerce ﬁght ensued in which Geryon
was shot dead. Making use of the cup of Helios once again, Herakles ferried the
stolen cattle across to the Iberian coast, and then drove them across the Pyrenees
and through southern Europe to Greece, visiting Italy and Sicily on the way.99
We must now consider some of the many adventures that befell Herakles as he
was travelling to the far west and back again. His outward journey was compara-
tively uneventful (unless he was confronted Antaios and Bousiris at this time, as
Diodorus suggests, rather than during his journey to the Hesperides, see p. 270).
On reaching the western end of the Libyan (i.e. North African) coast, he raised the
Pillars of Herakles to mark the western boundaries of the inhabited world. These
were usually identiﬁed with the Rock of Gibraltar (Mt Calpe) and the mountain
above Ceuta (Mt Abile) on either side of the Straits of Gibraltar;100 and some claimed
that Herakles also opened up the straits on this occasion to provide an outlet to the
Ocean, or else narrowed the existing straits to make them impassable to the monsters
of the Ocean.101 In another account, the pillar-rocks were raised in the very earliest
times by Briareos (one of the Hundred-Handers, see p. 67) and were later dedicated
to Herakles in recognition of his services;102 or else the pillars of Herakles were
ordinary pillars that stood in the temple of Melkart, a Phoenician god who was
identiﬁed with Herakles, at Gadeira (Cadiz) in southern Iberia.103
Herakles met with trouble quite frequently during his return journey because
people were tempted to steal from the herd that he was driving through their lands.
The Ligurians of southern France, for instance, attacked him for that reason not far
from the city of Arles (which he was said to have founded, naming it Alesia in
memory of his wandering, ale¯). Although he tried to repel them by use of his bow,
he ran out of arrows and prayed for help to his father Zeus, who rained vast quan-
tities of pebbles from the sky, enabling him to pelt his attackers with them until
they withdrew. The area now known as the Plaine de la Crau, which is covered by
masses of pebbles that reduce it to barrenness, was pointed out as the very spot
where this wonder took place.104
Most interesting of all are the stories associated with Herakles’ wanderings
through Italy and Sicily; although they are neglected by Apollodorus, a conveniently
accessible anthology is provided by Diodorus, who, as a Greek Sicilian, was natu-
rally intrigued by this aspect of Herakles’ mythology.105 Leaving aside the other
records and traces of his passage (his very footprints could be seen in Apulia,
preserved like the tracks of a dinosaur106), we will concentrate on two interrelated
stories from the southernmost stage of his journey. At Rhegion (Rhegium) on the
Italian shore of the Straits of Messina, a bull broke free from the herd and swam
across to Sicily; and since Herakles wandered around the area asking the local people
whether they had seen a missing bull-calf (italos, or vitulus under the corresponding
Latin name), the land came to be known as Italy from that time forth. It was also
explained that Rhegion came to be called by that name because the bull ‘broke
away’ there (as though the name were derived from the Greek verb rhe¯gnumi or
aporhe¯gnumi).107 Finding no sign of the bull in Italy, the hero crossed over to Sicily,

where he discovered that ERYX, a local ruler in the west of the island, had gained
possession of the beast and had mixed it among his own cattle. This Eryx was the
eponym of the Sicilian mountain of that name (now Mt San Giuliano), which was
the site of an important sanctuary of Aphrodite; he was a son of Aphrodite by Boutes
(an Argonaut whom she had rescued, see p. 395) or by Poseidon. When he refused
to surrender the bull unless Herakles could defeat him in a wrestling-match, the
hero forced him to the ground three times (the usual condition for a victory) before
proceeding to kill him.108 Or in another account, Herakles was challenged to a
wrestling-match by Eryx as he was making a circuit of the island with the cattle,
and fought with him on the agreement that he would gain the kingdom if he won,
but would surrender the cattle if he lost. After defeating Eryx, he entrusted the
kingdom to the local people on condition that they would hand it over if any of
his descendants should arrive in the area in the future to claim it. Dorieus, a member
of the Spartan royal family (which was supposedly of Heraklid descent, see p. 291),
came to Sicily toward the end of the sixth century BC and actually laid claim to
the territory on these grounds (but was soon killed by enemies within the island).109
For two minor adventures of Herakles in the toe of Italy, see p. 581.
The cult of Herakles (or Hercules as he was known in Latin) was introduced to
Rome at a relatively early period, and a number of aetiological legends came to be
developed by Roman authors in which he was said to have introduced cultic inno-
vations while visiting the site of the city with the cattle of Geryon. The most
interesting and by far the most famous is the one that was devised to account for
the origin of his oldest cult at Rome, at the Ara Maxima (Greatest Altar) in the
Forum Boarium. Originally a private cult administered by two old patrician fami-
lies, the Potitii and the Pinarii, it was deemed to be of venerable antiquity (even
if it cannot really have been so very ancient since Greek rites were practised at it).
So what could be more natural than to imagine that it might have been founded
by Herakles/Hercules himself in the very earliest times while he was in Italy, before
he was a god and before the city yet existed? As he was resting by the Tiber with
the cattle, so the story goes, a monster or brigand of the area called CACUS caught
sight of the beasts from his lair on the Palatine hill (or the Aventine in one version),
and stole some of them while the hero was lying asleep. Dragging them tail-fore-
most to his cave, he blocked up the entrance with a huge boulder and awaited the
departure of their owner; and although Hercules noticed their absence and tried to
ﬁnd them, he failed in his efforts because all the tracks seemed to lead away from
the cave, and he was ﬁnally obliged set off without them. As he was driving the
remaining beasts away, however, some of them began to low and their fellows within
the cave (or just one of them) bellowed in reply. Hastily seizing his club, Hercules
rushed up the hillside toward the source of the noise, forced his way into the cave,
and cudgelled or throttled Cacus to death to recover the cattle. In the traditional
version, Cacus was a ﬁre-breathing monster of semi-human appearance who tried to
defend himself by spewing out blasts of ﬂame; or in rationalistic accounts, he was
simply a rufﬁan of exceptional size. On hearing of the death of Cacus, Evander
(Euandros in Greek), an Arcadian who was said to have ruled at the site in the time,
approached Hercules to express his gratitude, and reported that his mother (who
— The life of Herakles —
266

was a prophetic nymph) had foretold that he was destined to be raised to the heavens
as a god. Wanting to be the ﬁrst to pay him divine honours, Evander raised the
Ara Maxima to him as his ﬁrst altar and sacriﬁced a calf to him; or in another
version, Hercules, who was never noted for his modesty, raised the altar in his own
honour in response to the prophecy.110 To explain why the cult was originally
controlled by the Potitii and Pinarii (until it was taken over by the state toward
the end of the fourth century BC), some authors added that Hercules instructed
members of these two families in the Greek rites that were to be practised at it.111
Although it was once widely argued that this tale of cattle-thievery was an ancient myth
that was developed independently at Rome in accordance with a common Indo-European
pattern, it is far more likely that it was an antiquarian legend of fairly late invention that
was modelled on the various Greek tales (some quite old) in which people of a number of
regions were said to have tried to rob the hero of his cattle during his long journey. Cacus
himself was of Italian origin as would be expected. Although he appears as a seer in Etruscan
images, he was apparently honoured as a ﬁre-deity in early Rome in conjunction with a
female counterpart called Caca. He was associated with the Palatine hill in particular (even
if Vergil transfers his cave to the Aventine); a ﬂight of steps known as the Scala Caci or
‘Steps of Cacus’ was cut into southern ﬂank of the hill, leading up from the Circus Maximus.
As a godling who was associated with ﬁre, Cacus could easily be transformed into a ﬁre-
breathing monster who could serve as a worthy opponent for Hercules; and the fact that his
name could be equated with kakos, the Greek adjective for bad or evil, may have encour-
aged this reinterpretation of his nature. The most imaginative detail in the resulting story,
the monster’s ruse in making the cattle walk backwards to his cave, was surely recycled from
the famous episode in early Greek myth in which Hermes tried to conceal his theft of
Apollo’s cattle by that means (see p. 162).
After his Italian detour, Herakles drove the cattle around the top of the Adriatic
and down toward Greece. But as he was doing so, Hera tried to frustrate him by
sending a gadﬂy against the cattle, causing them to disperse among the foothills of
the mountains of Thrace. With much difﬁculty, Herakles collected most of them
together again, even if a few were left behind to become the ancestors of the wild
cattle of Thrace. When he ﬁnally arrived in Mycenae, he delivered the cattle to
Eurystheus, who sacriﬁced them to Hera.112
According to a picturesque tale recounted by Herodotus, Herakles’ travels took
him to Scythia, where a viper-woman stole his chariot-horses and demanded that
he should sleep with her as a condition for their return. She was formed like an
ordinary woman from the buttocks upwards, but otherwise like a snake. She managed
to detain him in Scythia for some time, bearing him three sons, Agathyrsos, Gelanos
and Skythes; and when the time came for him to depart, he left one of his bows
and a sword-belt behind, telling her that the kingdom should go to the son who
could draw the bow and put on the sword-belt in the proper way. When it later
turned out that only the youngest, Skythes, was able to do so, she drove the other
two away in obedience to their father’s orders. The three brothers were the epony-
mous mythical ancestors of the Scythians and two neighbouring peoples, the
Agathyrsoi and Gelanoi; and the story explained the origin of the distinctive Scythian
bow, which resembled the bow that was supposed to have been used by Herakles.113

Eleventh labour: the Fetching of Kerberos
The most daunting of the labours of Herakles is also the one that can be traced to
the earliest period, since the Iliad already mentions how ‘Eurystheus sent him down
to the house of Hades, keeper of the gates, to fetch the hound of hateful Hades
from Erebos’. The Homeric epics also report that he received invaluable assistance
from Athena and Hermes.114 He descended to the nether regions through the route
that was most commonly favoured by mythical adventurers, the bottomless cave at
Cape Tainaron in the southern Peloponnese.115 According to late Latin sources, the
ferryman Charon was so alarmed to see him that he agreed to take him across to
the land of the dead even though he was still alive, and was punished for this breach
of his duties by being thrown into chains for a year.116 Apollodorus remarks that
the shades all ﬂed at the sight of the hero, with the exception of Meleagros and the
Gorgon Medusa. The story of his encounter with Meleagros is recounted in full in
an ode of Bacchylides, who describes how Meleagros told him the sad story of his
premature death, causing him to weep for the only time in his life, and recom-
mended his sister Deianeira to him as a wife (counsel that the hero would eventually
follow, see p. 279).117 As for the Gorgon, Herakles drew his sword as if to fend her
off until Hermes advised him that she was merely a harmless phantom. As he
advanced further into the land of the dead, he came across Theseus and Peirithoos,
who had been imprisoned there ever since they had entered Hades alive with the
crazy intent of abducting Persephone (see p. 361); and he raised Theseus up from
his seat to set him free (along with Peirithoos in some accounts). He also tried to
help Askalaphos, an inhabitant of the Underworld who had been buried under a
stone by Demeter (see further on p. 129). Wanting to procure blood for the shades
(to restore their wits, see p. 109), he slaughtered some of the cattle of Hades, to
the anger of their herdsman Menoitios, who challenged him to a wrestling-match;
Herakles seized Menoitios in a ﬁrm grip and broke his ribs, but was obliged to let
go of him when Persephone intervened.118
Kerberos would not allow himself to be captured without a struggle, and he was
a formidable opponent even for the greatest of heroes, for he was not only large and
powerful but had three heads (in the usual tradition at least) and a snake in his tail.
The literary accounts of this episode are all relatively late. According to Apollodorus,
Herakles asked Hades for permission to remove him, and was told that he could
take him if he could overpower him without using any weapons; trusting to the
protection of his breastplate and lionskin (which was of course impenetrable), he
seized Kerberos’ head in his arms and gripped him tightly, ignoring the bites that
he was receiving from the snake in his tail, until the beast submitted.119 Or in a
slightly different version in which Herakles was ordered to overpower him without
using his shield or metallic weapons, he used his lionskin for a shield and intimi-
dated him by hurling sharp stones at him (or perhaps shooting stone-tipped arrows);
and when Hades tried to obstruct him after he had seized the beast, he was under-
standably annoyed and threatened the god with his bow.120 Diodorus is exceptional
in suggesting that Persephone delivered Kerberos to him ready-chained.121 The
visual record takes us back to the sixth century BC, for vase-paintings from that
period show Herakles confronting or pacifying the dog, often with Hermes or Athena
— The life of Herakles —
268

(or both) standing by or even assisting. Other images show the hero approaching
Persephone or Hades beforehand; since one or the other of them is sometimes shown
watching as he paciﬁes Kerberos, it would seem that he was thought to have gained
their permission beforehand as in the preceding literary accounts.
After successfully intimidating or mollifying Kerberos, Herakles brought him up
to the world above to show him to Eurystheus, ascending at Tainaron (or through
the temple of Artemis at Troizen, or through a cleft in the earth at Hermione
nearby, or through a bottomless cave at Herakleia by the Black Sea122). As soon as
he had proved the success of his mission, causing Eurystheus a considerable fright
as he did so, he returned Kerberos to the gates of Hades to allow him to resume
his normal duties.
Various minor tales came to be attached to this myth, originating either in local traditions or
in the imagination of later poets. It was claimed, for instance, that the aconite, a notoriously
poisonous plant, ﬁrst sprang from gall that was spewed up by Kerberos on his arrival in the
upper world (at Herakleia Pontica in this account).123 Or according to an Argive legend,
Kerberos escaped from Herakles by the spring of Kynadra on the road between Mycenae and
the great sanctuary of Hera nearby, and that the water of the spring was therefore known as
the Water of Freedom (eleutherion hydo¯r) ever afterwards; ex-slaves would drink from it after
gaining their release.124 Another story stated that the terrible aspect of the hell-hound caused
a man who saw him to turn to stone.125 It was said that Herakles had prepared himself for
the journey to Hades by having himself initiated into the Eleusinian mysteries (which would
seem a good idea since initiates were supposed to be assured of a better fate in the Underworld,
though normally after their death of course). Since strangers from outside Attica were not yet
allowed to be initiated, he had to be adopted beforehand by a local man, a certain Pylios; and
since he was polluted because of his slaughter of the Centaurs, Demeter founded the lesser
mysteries (preliminary rites celebrated at Agriai just outside Athens) to purify him from the
bloodshed. He was then initiated by Eumolpos (see p. 370) or Mousaios. In future times,
anyone who spoke Greek could be initiated unless polluted by murder.126
Twelfth labour: the Apples of the Hesperides
As his ﬁnal labour (or his penultimate labour in some accounts, before his descent to
Hades), Herakles was ordered to fetch some of the golden apples of the Hesperides.
These grew on a wondrous tree (or trees) in the garden of the gods at the edges of the
earth, where they were guarded by a group of beautiful nymphs, the HESPERIDES
(see p. 28), and protected by a huge snake, sometimes named as Ladon127 in the later
tradition. To discover the way to this remote and mysterious place, Herakles
consulted the nymphs of the Eridanos (a mythical river, later identiﬁed with the Po,
see p. 41), who advised him to question Nereus, the old man of the sea; so he seized
Nereus while he was asleep and kept him tied up as he repeatedly transformed
himself, refusing to release him until he revealed the proper route.128
The Hesperides would traditionally have lived in the far west, as is indicated in
their name (daughters of the evening), their proximity to Atlas (see below) and 
various other factors. In that case, Herakles would have had to make his way to the
north-western corner of Africa. In the accounts offered by Pherecydes and Apollo-
dorus,129 however, he travels to the northern fringes of the world by a strangely

circuitous route: starting near the Ocean in the west, he travels across the whole
breadth of Africa until he reaches the encircling Ocean again on the opposite side of
the world, and sails around it to the Caucasus, where he meets Prometheus, and 
then proceeds on foot toward Atlas and the Hesperides, here located in the remote
north near the Hyperboreans. This relocation was evidently thought necessary because
of the role that Prometheus, as a prisoner in the Caucasus, was supposed to have
played in this version of the story (see below).
We will begin by tracing in greater detail the outward journey as it is described
in this latter version. The curious route makes some sort of sense if it is remem-
bered that the present starting-point would originally have been the goal of the
journey, and that Herakles would originally have travelled west through Africa to
reach it. Here too, of course, he must initially have passed west by some route after
questioning Nereus. Setting off from Tartessos in southern Iberia, Herakles ﬁrst
travelled through North Africa to Egypt, encountering the Libyan giant ANTAIOS
on the way. Antaios used to force passing strangers to wrestle with him, and killed
every one of them until Herakles arrived; Pindar adds that he would take their
skulls to roof the temple of Poseidon130 (who was commonly regarded as his father).
According to a familiar story that ﬁrst appears in Roman sources, he was uncon-
querable by any ordinary wrestler because his strength increased whenever he came
into contact with the ground.131 Reversing the normal procedure in a wrestling-
match, in which victory would be achieved by forcing the loser to the ground,
Herakles therefore heaved him up from the ground and crushed him in his arms
until he was dead.132 Although this feature of Antaios’ legend presumably origi-
nated in Greece, perhaps in the Hellenistic period, nothing is known for certain
about its time of origin; there is no unequivocal evidence for it in the arts prior to
its appearance in literary accounts by Ovid and Lucan. It was explained that Antaios
was a son of the Earth and gained added strength through her touch, as is already
stated by Ovid.133
Pindar and Pherecydes locate Antaios at Irasa near Cyrene, in the region of North Africa
adjoining Egypt; according to the latter author, Herakles slept with Antaios’ wife Iphinoe
after his death, fathering a son by her, Palaimon or ‘Wrestler’ (also a title of the hero
himself).134 According to a late tradition, the wife of Antaios was Tinge (the eponym of
Tingis, now Tangier, at the north-western corner of Africa), and Herakles’ son by her was
Sophax, the mythical ancestor of the kings of Mauretania, the westernmost province of North
Africa.135 The story has been shifted to the west in this version to enable Mauretanian royal
family to claim descent from the great hero. Sophax was presumably named after Syphax, a
great Numidian potentate of the third century BC. The supposed tomb of Tinge could be
seen near Tangier. According to a none too serious tale, Herakles was tied down by Pygmies
while he was lying asleep after his encounter with Antaios (see p. 580).
After arriving in Egypt, Herakles had another perilous encounter, now with the
ﬁctional pharaoh BOUSIRIS (whose name was derived from the name of a town in
the Nile delta, Per-Usire or House of Osiris). He seized and imprisoned Herakles
with the intention of bringing him to sacriﬁce, as was his usual practice with
strangers. For when his kingdom had once remained barren for nine years, a seer
from Cyprus, a certain Phrasios, had revealed that fertility would be restored if a
— The life of Herakles —
270

male visitor from abroad were sacriﬁced to Zeus every year; and after initiating 
the process by slaughtering the seer himself, Bousiris had continued to sacriﬁce
foreigners ever since. Herakles broke his shackles, however, as he was being brought
to the altar, and killed Bousiris along with his son.136 Bousiris was described as a
son of Poseidon by Lysianassa, daughter of Epaphos, even though Epaphos as a child
of Io (see p. 231) must have lived many generations earlier.137 In his paradoxical
defence of Bousiris, the Athenian orator Isocrates uses this chronological inconsis-
tency as a pretext to discredit the whole story.138
The geography of Herakles’ journey becomes somewhat confused at that point.
According to Pherecydes (if the surviving summary can be trusted) he now made
his way to Thebes (i.e. up the Nile to Upper Egypt) and across some mountains to
‘outer Libya’, which he cleared of wild beasts by use of his bow.139 Diodorus states
quite similarly that he travelled up the Nile to Ethiopia, where he killed the local
ruler EMATHION, son of Eos, when subjected to an unprovoked attack from him.140
In the rather muddled account by Apollodorus (who also mentions a journey to
Rhodes), he killed Emathion after passing by Arabia, and then journeyed through
Libya to the outer sea.141 Taking these reports together, it makes some sense to
imagine him travelling south through Egypt to the edge of the unknown, and then
across to some ill-deﬁned imaginary East Africa (or Outer Libya) adjoining the outer
Ocean. He arrived somewhere on the eastern shores of Africa in any case, and
borrowed the cup of Helios once again to sail north around the outer Ocean until
he arrived at the Caucasus. Prometheus had been chained to a cliff in the Caucasus
ever since he had incurred the anger of Zeus by stealing ﬁre for mortals (see p. 96);
and he was subjected to ever-renewed torment, for an eagle would peck each day
at his liver, which grew anew each night. Herakles took pity on him and shot the
eagle, and then sought the permission of Zeus to set him free entirely.142
According to Apollodorus, he achieved this by presenting Cheiron to Zeus as an immortal
being who was willing to die in place of Prometheus. Now Cheiron, as we have seen just above
(see p. 259), had been suffering unendurable pain ever since Herakles had accidentally
wounded him with one of his poisoned arrows; and Apollodorus writes in this connection 
that ‘he wanted to die, but was unable to because he was immortal – only when Prometheus
offered himself to Zeus to become immortal in his place was he able to die’.143 Since
Prometheus was of divine birth, this cannot be literally interpreted as meaning that Cheiron
exchanged his immortality for the mortality of Prometheus; nor could it easily be explained
in that case why Zeus should have agreed to the release of Prometheus as a consequence. 
We are surely intended to suppose that by accepting death as a immortal being, Cheiron is
in some sense taking over the punishment of Prometheus, who is therefore permitted to
resume his normal existence as a god. Conﬁrmation for this idea can be found in some 
lines from the Prometheus Bound, in which Hermes tells Prometheus that he can have no hope
of release ‘until some god reveals himself ready to take on your sufferings and descend of his
own free will to sunless Hades’.144 Although it might have seemed almost impossible that 
any immortal being would agree to sacriﬁce himself in this way, Cheiron was willing 
to accept death as the price that he would have to pay if he was to be released from the
intolerable pain of his wound.
Prometheus repaid Herakles for his services by advising him on how he could best
achieve his quest. He suggested that the hero should not attempt to fetch the apples

himself, but should ask Atlas to do so on his behalf, offering to take over the burden
of the sky in the mean time. Happy to be released from his exertions for a while,
Atlas set off on his way, procured three apples from the Hesperides, and brought
them back to Herakles; but he was understandably reluctant to return to his arduous
duty, and asked Herakles to continue to hold the sky for the present, saying that
he himself would take the apples to Eurystheus. Prometheus had foreseen that this
might happen, however, and had suggested an appropriate ruse to Herakles, who
tricked Atlas into taking the sky back by asking him to hold it for a moment while
he prepared a pad for his head. The artistic evidence indicates that this version of
the story, which is ﬁrst recounted by Pherecydes, was familiar by the middle of the
sixth century BC.145
In the other main version, which ﬁrst appears in tragedy but can again be traced
further back in the visual arts, Herakles plucked the apples himself after killing the
dragon that guarded them.146 This would almost certainly have been the original
version of the legend. Although the literary sources offer no details on the killing,
we can imagine it clearly enough from depictions in vase-paintings, which show the
hero raising his club against the snake as it entwines itself around the apple-tree.
In astral mythology, Zeus is said to have placed an image of the confrontation among
the stars, representing Herakles as the constellation Engonasin (the Kneeler, now
known as Hercules), in which he can be seen kneeling on one leg as he aims his
club at the serpent as represented in the neighbouring constellation Draco.147
Considering that the snake was no harmful monster but a servant of the gods which
was protecting divine property, it might be thought that it would be improper for
Herakles to kill it; and in a version which is recorded in vase-paintings and other
images from the ﬁfth century onwards, the killing is indeed suppressed, and Herakles
acquires the apples in a peaceable manner from the Hesperid nymphs. This was the
manner, incidentally, in which Atlas was said to have procured them.
After gaining the apples, whether by direct means or indirect, Herakles took them
back to Mycenae and presented them to Eurystheus. As soon as Eurystheus was
assured that the labour had been fulﬁlled, he returned the apples to Herakles; and
the hero handed them on to Athena to be taken back to the garden of the gods,
for they were too holy to be left anywhere else.148 By the completion of his ﬁnal
labour (whether the fetching of the apples, as here, or the fetching of Kerberos as
in the other tradition), Herakles freed himself forever from his servitude to the
ignoble Eurystheus.
HERAKLES’ SERVITUDE TO OMPHALE 
AND MAJOR CAMPAIGNS
Herakles tries to win Iole as his wife, murders her brother
Iphitos, and is enslaved to Omphale
Now that Herakles was able to turn his thoughts to personal matters, he decided
that the time had come for him to seek a new wife and found a new family. Since
there could be no question of him returning to his original wife after killing the
— The life of Herakles —
272

children of their union, he ﬁrst travelled to Thebes to settle his affairs with Megara
by arranging for her to marry his nephew Iolaos;149 and having heard that
EURYTOS, king of Oichalia, was offering his daughter IOLE to anyone who could
defeat him and his sons in at archery, he travelled on to Oichalia (apparently in
Euboea, see p. 283) to take up the challenge. We have already encountered Eurytos
as the man who instructed the young Herakles in archery (see p. 250); his father
Melaneus was a son of the archer-god Apollo. Although Herakles defeated Eurytos
and his sons in the contest, the king refused to surrender his daughter to him,
saying that he feared that the hero might kill her children if she should bear any
to him, just as he had killed the children of his previous marriage. Eurytos was
supported in his decision by all his sons apart from the eldest, IPHITOS, who argued
that Iole should be handed over in accordance with the terms of the contest. Angry
though he was, Herakles was obliged to depart without her, but vowed to return
to seek revenge when circumstances permitted.150 As events turned out, his return
would be delayed for many years, until long after he had taken another woman,
Deianeira, as his new wife; and by sacking Oichalia and seizing Iole, he would bring
disaster to himself as well as to Eurytos (see pp. 283–4).
Shortly after Herakles’ unhappy visit to Oichalia, some mares were stolen from
the herds of Eurytos (or of his son Iphitos). Our sources disagree on the identity of
the thief. Herakles may have stolen them as a ﬁrst act of revenge, or else this was
simply another theft by that prince of thieves Autolykos; and in the latter case,
Herakles may have acquired the mares at second hand by buying them from
Autolykos.151 Suspicion fell on Herakles in any case, and Iphitos went to Tiryns to
investigate. This led to the most discreditable episode in the hero’s career, in which
he murdered Iphitos after receiving him into his home as a guest. According to
Diodorus, he took him to a lofty tower of the citadel and asked whether he could
see the mares grazing below; and when Iphitos replied that he could not (for they
had been hidden away beforehand), Herakles hurled him down to his death, saying
that he had been falsely accused.152 Although it was commonly accepted that this
was a deliberate murder, an exculpatory version was also developed in which the
hero was said to have killed Iphitos during a temporary ﬁt of madness, as when he
had killed his children.153
Herakles was struck by a terrible disease as a result of his crime and set off to
seek puriﬁcation. After meeting with a refusal from Nestor, king of Pylos, who was
unwilling to purify him because of his friendship with Eurytos, he travelled on to
Amyklai in Laconia, where the rites were performed by a certain Deiphobos, son of
Hippolytos, who is otherwise unknown.154 When the disease persisted nonetheless,
Herakles visited Delphi to consult the oracle. The Pythian priestess refused to grant
him a response, however, because he was polluted by the murder, and he was so
angry that he started to plunder the temple, and carried off the Pythia’s tripod 
(see p. 166) with the intention of founding an oracle of his own. Apollo had no
intention of allowing any such thing and tried to seize the tripod back; but violence
was averted by the intervention of Zeus, who separated his two sons by hurling 
a thunderbolt between them. It was now agreed that Herakles should receive a
response, and he was told that he would be delivered from his afﬂiction if he were

sold into slavery and paid the purchase-price to Eurytos as compensation.155 So he
was put up for auction by Hermes, and was bought by OMPHALE, queen of Lydia,
who offered three talents for him (perhaps a hundred times more than the average
price for a slave in classical Athens). The money was duly offered to Eurytos, but
he regarded it as tainted and refused to accept it.156
The confrontation between Herakles and Apollo over the tripod was a very popular subject in
vase-paintings from the mid-sixth to ﬁfth centuries BC, and can be traced back to the late
eighth century in the visual arts. A passing observation by Pausanias would suggest that it
was also a popular theme with early poets, even if there is little sign of it in the surviving
literature.157 The local tradition at Gytheion in Laconia claimed that Herakles and Apollo
joined together to found the city after settling their quarrel over the tripod.158
Omphale, daughter of Iardanos (or Iardanes), was a widow who had assumed power
in Lydia on the west coast of Asia Minor after the death of her husband Tmolos.
Authors and artists of the Hellenistic and Roman periods liked to divert themselves
by imagining how she behaved toward her improbable bondsman; a popular idea
suggested that she forced him to dress in her delicate saffron robes and to assist the
women of the court in their spinning, while she dressed in his lionskin and took
possession of his club.159 It could be supposed, furthermore, that he willingly
consented to this treatment because he had fallen in love with her, and he was some-
times said to have fathered a child or some children by her, either during the period
of his servitude or after she had granted him an early release.
There were also more serious tales in which he performed proper heroic tasks to the beneﬁt of
the local people. One notable villain of the area was LITYERSES, an illegitimate son of Midas,
who used to challenge passers-by to a harvesting contest (or simply forced them to help him
in his ﬁelds) and then cut off their heads with his scythe at the end of the day, binding their
bodies into the corn-stooks. When he was foolish enough to try this with Herakles, the hero
beheaded him with the scythe that was provided for the work.160 Or in another version,
Herakles killed him to save Daphnis (see p. 211), who had wandered to the region from his
native Sicily and had been put to work by Lityerses.161 The name of Lityerses was derived from
an ancient Phrygian reaping song, the Lityerses-song. Another local villain was SYLEUS, who
used to force passing strangers to hoe his vineyards; Herakles killed him with his own hoe
along with his daughter Xenodike, and burned his vines to their roots.162 In a comical version
from a Satyr-play by Euripides, Herakles was sold to Syleus (who presumably took the place
of Omphale for the purposes of the play), and soon gave his purchaser reason to regret his
temerity in buying him; for the clumsy hero caused havoc in his vineyard, and slaughtered
one of his oxen and ransacked his cellars to satisfy his enormous appetites.163 There was also
a version of the story in which Herakles married Xenodike after killing her father, but stayed
away from her so long that she died of a broken heart.164 During this period, Herakles also
ran across the KERKOPES, a pair of small ape-like men who were notorious for their thievery.
They tried to steal his weapons as he lay asleep, but he woke up and caught them in the act,
and then hung them upside down from either end of a pole to carry them off (just as game
would be carried off after a hunt). Now their mother had warned them to beware of ‘the black-
bottomed man’, and when they observed from their inverted position that the buttocks of
Herakles were dark and hairy where they were not covered by his lionskin, they recognized
that the warning had been fulﬁlled and laughed and joked about the matter, causing such
— The life of Herakles —
274

amusement to Herakles that he decided to set them free. They came to a bad end nonethe-
less, for they were ultimately turned to stone for attempting to cheat Zeus himself.165 In
lesser-known tales, Herakles also defeated the Itones, some predatory neighbours of Omphale,
and killed a huge snake by the Sagaris, a river of that area.166
Herakles launches a series of campaigns, starting with 
an attack on Troy
After expiating for the murder of Iphitos, Herakles returned to Tiryns to assemble
an army for an expedition against Laomedon, king of Troy, who had offended him
during the period of his labours. This campaign marks the beginning of the period
of his greatest deeds (praxeis, as opposed to his athloi or labours, see pp. 254–5); for
after bringing his Trojan campaign to a successful conclusion, he also became
involved in a conﬂict with the Coans during his return, and went on to conduct
three major campaigns within the Peloponnese itself. Since his war against Troy
and subsequent campaign against Augeias in the Peloponnese were launched to
avenge grievances that he had incurred during his labours, and since his three
Peloponnesian campaigns fall into a natural group, these ‘deeds’ of Herakles could
be plausibly assigned to a common period while he was still living in the
Peloponnese after his labours. The fourth and ﬁnal period of his life could be said
to have begun when he left the Peloponnese to marry the Aetolian princess Deianeira.
According to the biographies of Diodorus and Apollodorus, he lived in central Greece
thereafter, ﬁrst at Deianeira’s home-city of Calydon and later at Trachis; and such
adventures as were recorded for him in central and northern Greece (apart from the
early episodes while he was based at Thebes) came to be assigned to this last period
of his life.
During the third and penultimate period of his life with which we are presently
concerned, Herakles either continued to live at Tiryns as he had during his labours,
or else was forced out by Eurystheus after a time and moved to Pheneos in northern
Arcadia, the home-city of his grandmother Laonome. According to the latter tradi-
tion, Eurystheus ordered him to leave after his ﬁrst and unsuccessful assault against
Augeias (see p. 277) on the allegation that he was plotting to seize power in Argos.
Herakles beneﬁted the people of Pheneos by digging potholes (which can still be
seen) to drain the excess water from the plain outside the city.167
We will now trace the history of Herakles’ major campaigns in the order in which
they were said to have been conducted. As he had been travelling to the land of
the Amazons to fetch the belt of Hippolyte (see pp. 263–4), he had sailed past Troy
and had been struck by the plight of a maiden who had been tied to a rock by the
shore. This was HESIONE, the daughter of the king, who had been exposed there
at the order of an oracle, to serve as prey to a sea-monster that had been sent against
the land by Poseidon (see further on p. 523). Feeling pity for the princess and seeing
an opportunity for gain, Herakles had approached her father LAOMEDON and had
offered to kill the monster in return for a speciﬁc reward, the divine horses that 
had been presented to Tros as compensation for the abduction of Ganymedes (see
p. 522); but after he had fulﬁlled the task, Laomedon had refused to hand over 
the promised reward (or had tried to substitute ordinary horses for the divine ones).

— The life of Herakles —
275

The hero had been obliged to continue on his way, but had vowed to return at a
future date to exact vengeance.168
According to an alternative tradition from the Hellenistic period, Herakles confronted the
monster as he was sailing to Colchis with the Argonauts.169 Herakles took no part in any
of the great panhellenic adventures in the earlier tradition, and even when he was intro-
duced into the story of the Argonauts in this way, he was usually said to have been left
behind at an early stage in the voyage (see p. 385), for no speciﬁc tales were recorded for
him in this connection and he might have tended to cast the colourless Jason into the shade.
Some authors who were more interested in spinning a good yarn than observing the tradition
acknowledged this latter point by making Herakles the leader of the expedition. If he did
join the Argonauts, he sailed with them during the period of his labours or shortly after
completing them.
Herakles assembled a sizeable army for the assault on Troy, recruiting the aid of
some formidable heroes including Telamon, the father of Aias (see p. 533), and
Oikles, the father of Amphiaraos, and led them across the Aegean in eighteen ships
(or only eight according to the Iliad170). After arriving at the Troad, he left Oikles
behind to guard the ships while he advanced against the city with the main force.
Having been caught by surprise and ﬁnding himself outnumbered as a consequence,
Laomedon tried to weaken the position of the invaders by advancing against their
ships with the intention of setting ﬁre to them; but although Oikles was killed in
the ensuing confrontation, his followers escaped back to their ships and rowed away
from the shore. Laomedon then withdrew toward the city and was killed along with
most of his followers when he engaged with Herakles and the main force just outside
the walls.171 Or else he was killed during the storming of the city. Telamon was
the ﬁrst to break through the city walls, entering Troy ahead of Herakles, who was
so angry at being outdone that he threatened Telamon with his sword. Thinking
swiftly, Telamon piled some stones together and paciﬁed the hero by telling him
that he was building an altar to Herakles the Noble Victor (Kallinikos, a cultic
title of Herakles).172 All the sons of Laomedon apart from Priam were killed in the
ﬁghting. After his victory, Herakles made amends to Telamon by offering the king’s
daughter Hesione to him as a prize of war; and he allowed Hesione to pick out a
single person to be freed from among the captives. When she picked her only
surviving brother, he said that she must offer something in ransom for him, and
she paid for him with her veil. For this reason, so it was said, Laomedon’s son and
successor, who had originally been called Podarkes, came to be known as Priam (as
though his name were derived from priamai, to buy).173 Since Telamon was already
married, he took Hesione as a concubine rather than as his wife, and she bore him
a son Teukros, who would later ﬁght at Troy alongside his legitimate son Aias.174
Seeing an opportunity to cause harm to Herakles, Hera sent storm-winds against
his ships as he was sailing home from Troy, causing him to be driven to the island
of Cos in the south-eastern Aegean. Imagining that the strangers must be pirates,
the Coans tried to repel them by pelting them with stones, but they forced a landing
after nightfall and captured the main city. Herakles killed the king of the Coans,
a certain Eurypylos, son of Poseidon and Astypalaia.175 The island would subse-
quently be ruled by descendants of the hero, for he fathered a son Thessalos by
— The life of Herakles —
276

Astyoche, the daughter of the dead king. The Coans would be commanded at Troy
by two sons of this Thessalos.176 It was after this episode that Athena fetched
Herakles to help the gods in their battle against the Giants (see further on p. 89).
In another account, Herakles lost ﬁve of his six ships in the storm and was wrecked on Cos
in the last of them. After coming ashore, he met Antagoras, a son of the king who was
tending the royal ﬂocks, and asked him for a sheep to still his hunger; but Antagoras chal-
lenged him to a ﬁght, and a general battle ensued when the Coans came to the help of
Antagoras and Herakles too received support from his followers. On ﬁnding that the tide
of battle was turning against him, Herakles sought refuge in a cottage which was inhab-
ited by an old Thracian woman, who disguised him by dressing him in women’s clothing.
He subsequently returned to battle, defeated the Coans, and slept with the king’s daughter
as above, fathering Thessalos. This was a local version of the legend which was devised to
explain why the priest of Herakles at Antimacheia on Cos used to wear women’s clothing
while offering sacriﬁce to him.177
Three Peloponnesian campaigns, against Augeias at Elis, 
Neleus at Pylos and Hippokoon at Sparta
After arriving back at Tiryns, Herakles made preparations for his ﬁrst campaign in
the Peloponnese, which was directed against AUGEIAS, king of Elis, in the north-
west of the peninsula. Augeias had angered him in much the same way as Laomedon,
by refusing to pay him the promised reward for a valuable service that he had
performed, in this case the clearing of the Augeian stables (see p. 261). On hearing
of Herakles’ intentions, Augeias assembled an army of his own, placing it under the
command of Eurytos and Kteatos, the MOLIONIDES (or Moliones), who would
prove to be a match even for Herakles himself because they were two men joined
into one. In the usual account, they were joined together at the waist (or shared a
single torso) but had separate limbs and heads, so forming a single being with four
legs, four arms and two heads.178 Poseidon had fathered them by a certain Molione
who was married to Augeias’ brother Aktor.179 Homer refers to them in the Iliad
(calling them the Moliones on one occasion and the Aktoriones on another) without
speciﬁcally stating that they were Siamese twins.180 A fragment from Ibycus, a lyric
poet of the sixth century BC, states that they were born as a united being from a
silver egg.181
The Moliones demonstrated the military advantages of their combined form by
inﬂicting a rare defeat on Herakles when he ﬁrst advanced against Elis. They caused
havoc to his army, killing his half-brother Iphikles, and forced him to withdraw to
the Argolid.182 Or in another version, which was obviously devised to spare Herakles
the shame of defeat, he negotiated a truce with the Molionides after falling ill, but
was attacked by them nonetheless when they learned of his condition and was forced
to retreat after suffering heavy losses.183 Herakles resorted to sharp practice to rid
himself of these troublesome opponents, by ambushing them at Kleonai in the north-
western corner of the Argolid as they were travelling to the Isthmian Games as
envoys of the Eleians, and were therefore supposed to be under the protection of a
religious truce.184 The Eleians demanded compensation from the Argives as a conse-
quence, and stayed away from the Isthmian Games in perpetuity after it was denied

to them.185 With the Molionides out of the way, Herakles seized the city of Elis
with little difﬁculty, killing Augeias and all his sons apart from Phyleus, who had
been living in Doulichion ever since he had been banished by his father for testi-
fying in favour of Herakles (see p. 261). In gratitude for his previous support, he
summoned Phyleus back to rule the kingdom; and he also founded the Olympian
festival and games, which were held in the province of Elis every four years.186
Herakles directed his next campaign against, NELEUS, the king of Pylos in
Messenia (see p. 424), for having refused to purify him after the murder of Iphitos
(see p. 273), or for having tried to rob him of the cattle of Geryon.187 Nestor, a
son of Neleus, refers to the episode in the Iliad, remarking that his father was killed
along with his eleven brothers.188 The most formidable of the sons of Neleus was
the eldest, PERIKLYMENOS, because his grandfather Poseidon had granted him
the power to change his shape at will.189 This brought him no advantage, however,
on the present occasion, since he was betrayed in the course of the ﬁghting by
Athena, who pointed out to Herakles that he had settled on the yoke of his chariot
in the form of a bee, enabling the hero to shoot him dead with a well-aimed arrow.
Such is the early account offered in the Hesiodic Catalogue; Apollodorus adds that
Periklymenos had taken the form of a lion and snake beforehand.190 In other versions,
he was clubbed to death as a ﬂy or shot as an eagle; or conversely, he escaped death
by ﬂying off as an eagle.191 After engaging in a ﬁerce battle with the remaining
troops (and perhaps even with some gods, see below), Herakles ﬁnally prevailed and
conquered the city, killing Neleus and all his sons apart from Nestor, who was
below military age and absent at the time because he was being reared at Gerenia,
a neighbouring town. As at Troy, Herakles allowed Nestor to take over the throne
as the only surviving heir; and he continued to rule at Pylos until well after the
Trojan War (see p. 424).192
Various reports suggest that Herakles confronted one or another of the gods in the course of
the ﬁghting. According to a passage in the Iliad, he shot Hades en Pylo¯ among the dead, but
it is far from certain that he is referring to sandy Pylos. As a scholion suggests, he may have
had the gates (pylos or pyle¯, usually in the plural as pylai) of Hades in mind, and in that case
the incident could have occurred while Herakles was fetching Kerberos. Hades went up to
Olympos in any case to seek a cure from the healing-god Paion. In his ninth Olympian Ode,
Pindar states that Herakles confronted Poseidon with his club while the god was helping to
defend Pylos (as is understandable since Neleus was a son of his), and then goes on to say that
the hero also confronted the archer Apollo, and Hades as he was assembling the dead with his
wand. It is not entirely clear whether we are to understand that these latter confrontations also
took place at Pylos; the scholiast asserts that these were properly separate incidents, relating
to Herakles’ theft of the Delphian tripod and seizing of Kerberos respectively. Some later
authors certainly assume, however, that Herakles wounded Hades at Pylos, where he might
well have come to assemble the many dead if not actually to ﬁght as an ally of the Pylians.193
It is stated in the Hesiodic Shield, furthermore, that Ares was wounded by the hero at Pylos,
as was Hera in an account by the epic poet Panyasis.194
After his campaign against Neleus, Herakles attacked HIPPOKOON, king of Sparta
(see p. 525), and his twelve or twenty sons to punish them for having fought as
allies of Neleus (or for having refused to purify him after the murder of Iphitos).195
— The life of Herakles —
278

He was also angered by the death of his cousin OIONOS, son of Likymnios, who
had been killed at Sparta in the following circumstances. While gazing at the palace
of Hippokoon during a visit to Sparta, Oionos had been alarmed by a ﬁerce watch-
dog that had rushed out toward him, and had struck it with a well-aimed stone;
and the sons of Hippokoon had reacted by rushing out in their turn with cudgels
and clubbing him to death.196 Oionos was otherwise remembered as the victor in
the foot-race at the ﬁrst Olympian Games.197
Since Hippokoon could call on the support of his many sons, Herakles visited
Kepheus, king of Tegea, as he was passing through Arcadia, and invited him and
his twenty sons to ﬁght as his allies. Although Kepheus was reluctant to leave his
city undefended, the hero persuaded him by providing his daughter with a lock of
the Gorgon’s hair that would put any attackers to ﬂight if held up from the city
walls (see further on p. 574).198 With the support of these and other allies, Herakles
killed Hippokoon and his sons in battle near Sparta and captured the city. The
victory proved expensive, however, since Kepheus was killed along with all his sons
(or all but three of them), as was Herakles’ half-brother Iphikles (in one tradition
at least, for it was also said that he was killed by the Molionides).199 In one account
of the story, Herakles was so enraged to hear of the fate of Oionos that he launched
an immediate attack without proper support, but was seriously wounded in the
thigh on this ﬁrst occasion and was obliged to withdraw to Therapne (on the Eurotas
to the south-west of Sparta), where his wound was cured by Asklepios.200 This tale
accounted for the origin of the local cult of Asklepios Kotyleus, which was said to
have been founded by Herakles; it was explained that Herakles gave him this 
title of Kotyleus because his hip-joint (kotyle¯) had been healed by him there. After
recovering from his wound, Herakles raised an army and launched a successful attack
as above. Since Tyndareos, the rightful king of Sparta, had been expelled by
Hippokoon and his sons (see p. 525), Herakles summoned him back to take over
the throne.201
THE LATER LIFE OF HERAKLES IN CENTRAL
AND NORTHERN GREECE
Herakles marries Deianeira and lives with her at Calydon 
until he accidentally kills a page-boy
After his campaign against Hippokoon, which would be the last of his wars in the
Peloponnese, Herakles decided to leave the peninsula altogether to settle in Aetolia
in the south-west corner of the mainland; for he wanted to marry DEIANEIRA, a
daughter of Oineus, king of Calydon, and to found a new family in her homeland.
As further explanation for his departure from the Peloponnese, some authors add
that he also wanted to make a new start because he was so distressed by the death
of his cousin Oionos and half-brother Iphikles.202
It was no easy matter for Herakles to win Deianeira as his bride since she was
also being courted by Acheloos, the god of the great river of that name that ﬂowed
along the western borders of Aetolia. Sophocles tells how he had been visiting her

father’s palace to seek her hand, causing her great alarm, for he was a fearsome 
being who would manifest himself now as a bull, now as a man, and now as a man
with the head of a bull. Herakles visited Acheloos by his own waters to wrestle
with him for Deianeira, who watched anxiously from the bank. Although the river-
god transformed himself into a bull and perhaps into other forms too, Herakles kept
a ﬁrm grip on him and ﬁnally forced him to submit by breaking off one of his
horns.203
Acheloos recovered his horn from Herakles by offering to exchange it for the horn of
Amaltheia, a magical horn that had the power to provide as much food and drink as anyone
could desire.204 This horn had originally been a gift from Zeus to the nymph (or nymphs) who
had reared him as an infant. In one account at least (see further on p. 75), he had been reared
by a nymph called Amaltheia, who had fed him on the milk of a she-goat; and when he grew
up, he broke a horn from the goat to turn it into a horn of plenty as a gift for his nurse. Or
else Amaltheia was the name of the goat itself.205 Apollodorus states the Amaltheia’s horn of
plenty was a bull’s horn (evidently a misapprehension that arose because it was exchanged for
the taurine horn of Acheloos). In the Roman world, the magical horn was known as the cornu
copias (i.e. horn of plenty), or in later Latin cornucopia; and it could be regarded as an attribute
of Copia, the personiﬁcation of Plenty (and also of Ceres, the harvest-goddess, as a goddess of
plenty). Ovid combines Greek and Roman motifs by suggesting that naiad nymphs ﬁlled the
broken horn of Acheloos with fruits and ﬂowers, and that Copia came to possess it as her horn
of plenty. Hyginus records a similar story in which Herakles is said to have given the broken
horn to the Hesperides, who created the horn of plenty by ﬁlling it with fruit.206 Ovid says
much the same about the horn of Amaltheia elsewhere, saying that her goat broke a horn off
on a tree, and that she ﬁlled it with fruit and took it to the infant Zeus.207
Herakles lived at Calydon for some years with his new wife, who bore him several
children, including Hyllos, whom we shall encounter again as the ﬁrst leader of the
Heraklids, and Ktesippos, the grandfather of Deiphontes (see p. 292), and a rare
daughter, Makaria (see p. 287).208 The hero was able to repay his hosts at some stage
by assisting them in a war against the Thesprotians, who lived to the north of them
in southern Epirus; after capturing their main city of Ephyra, he fathered a notable
son, Tlepolemos (see p. 293), by Astyoche, the daughter of its ruler Phylas.209
As the result of an unfortunate accident, Herakles was ﬁnally obliged to seek a
new home. For as he was feasting in the palace one day, a page-boy angered him
in some way while pouring water to clean his hands, and he struck out at him with
unintended force, causing his death (much as he had done with Linos long before,
see p. 250). It was explained that the boy provoked this reaction by using water
from a foot-bath, or simply by his clumsiness. The unfortunate page, who was given
a variety of names such as Eunomos (Good Behaviour) or Kyathos (Wine-ladle), 
was of noble birth or even a relation of the king; and although his father was willing
to forgive Herakles because he recognized that the killing had been an accident, 
the hero insisted on departing into exile to be puriﬁed and make a new start.210
He decided to travel to southern Thessaly to seek refuge with his old friend Keux,
who was king of Trachis (later Herakleia) at the head of the Malian Gulf. He was
accompanied on the journey by his wife and young son Hyllos, and perhaps other
children too.

Herakles confronts the Centaur Nessos and the Dryopians while
travelling to his ﬁnal home
The journey was not without its risks and adventures. Herakles and his wife had
an unpleasant encounter with a Centaur ﬁrst of all on reaching the river Euenos in
eastern Aetolia. This Centaur, NESSOS, used to carry people across the river in
return for a fee and offered to do the same on this occasion, alleging that the gods
had appointed him to his post of ferryman on account of his excellent character.
Although Herakles was quite capable of crossing on his own, he willingly paid
Nessos to carry Deianeira; but the Centaur was really of no better character than
most of his kind, and he attempted to rape Deianeira on reaching the opposite bank
(or else in mid-stream). She alerted her husband by her loud screams, however, and
he brought Nessos to the ground with one of his poisoned arrows. As the life ebbed
from his body, Nessos told Deianeira that if she wanted to acquire a powerful love-
potion to use on her husband, she should collect some of the semen that he had
shed on to the ground and mix it with some blood from his wound. She took him
at his word and did so, little realizing that the mixture would be a virulent poison
because the blood was tainted with the poison (i.e. hydra’s venom, see p. 284) from
Herakles’ arrow.211 As we will see (p. 258), Deianeira later applied this unsavoury
potion to some of her husband’s clothing with terrible effect, just as Nessos would
have hoped.
Later in the journey, Herakles and his family passed through the land of the
Dryopians (Dryopes), who lived in the area between Mt Parnassos and southern
Thessaly. On running across a Dryopian called THEIODAMAS who was driving a
pair of bullocks, Herakles asked him for a little food for his young son Hyllos; and
when this was refused to him, he secured a handsome supply of food by seizing and
slaughtering one of the bullocks. Theiodamas rushed back to his city to rouse his
fellow-Dryopians against the aggressor, and Herakles was hard-pressed in the ﬁght
that developed, falling into such danger that he had to arm his wife, who suffered
a wound in the breast.212 Or in a rather different version, Herakles met with no
immediate trouble after seizing the bullock, but returned to campaign against the
Dryopians after settling in Trachis.213
In the other main version of the story of Herakles’ conﬂict with the Dryopians, he expelled
them from their original homeland to punish them for a grave act of sacrilege, namely of plun-
dering the temple of Apollo at Delphi under the leadership of their ruler Phylas. With the
help of an army of Malians (i.e. men from Trachis and the surrounding area), Herakles
defeated them in battle, killing their king, and then took them to Delphi as an offering to
Apollo. The oracle ordered that they should be transferred abroad to the Peloponnese, and they
settled in the Argolid at Asine, a coastal town to the east of Nauplion; but they were later
expelled by the Argives and settled in a Messenian town of the same name.214 The Asinaians
of Messenia, who were proud to believe that they were of Dryopian descent, had their own
ideas about their history, preferring to suppose that their ancestors had abandoned the city on
Mt Parnassos before Herakles could capture them, and had later sailed over to the Argolid of
their own accord, where Eurystheus had been happy to give them a new home at Asine because
of his hatred for Herakles.215 People who were also thought to be of Dryopian origin could
be found in parts of Thessaly, Epirus, Euboea and Cyprus in historical times.216

— The life of Herakles —
281

Since the Dryopians were regarded as the original inhabitants of the province of Doris in
the local tradition, while the Dorians of the Peloponnese (who rightly believed that they had
come from the north) regarded Doris as their ancestral homeland, this story of the expulsion
of the Dryopians resolved a contradiction in the mythology of Central Greece. For if the
Dryopians had been driven out by Herakles, it could be explained that the Dorians had taken
their place, moving down from further north in Thessaly to occupy the vacant land, and lived
there until they invaded the Peloponnese under the leadership of the Heraklids (see below).
This pattern of events is ﬁrst attested by Herodotus, who alleges that the Dorians had moved
from Thessaly to Doris (which had previously been known as Dryopis) and thence to the
Peloponnese.217
Apollodorus mentions in passing that Herakles killed Laogoras, king of the Dryopians, a
man of violence and ally of the Lapiths, as he was feasting in the sanctuary of Apollo. The
latter detail would suggest that Laogoras was an alternative name for the Dryopian king
who was supposed to have plundered Delphi.218
After the perils of the journey, Herakles brought his family safely to Trachis, which
would be his home for the rest of his life.219 Little is recorded of his host KEUX
beyond the fact that was a good friend of Herakles (even if he was not powerful
enough to protect his family after his death, see p. 287). This Keux, who is of un-
known descent, should be distinguished from the Keux who was turned into a bird
(see p. 410). He ﬁgured prominently in a lost Hesiodic poem, the Marriage of Keux,
in which Herakles also appeared. Two children are recorded for him, a son Hippasos
who was killed during Herakles’ ﬁnal campaign (see p. 283), and a daughter
Themistonoe who became the wife of Kyknos, a violent opponent of Herakles whom
we shall encounter shortly.220
Final campaigns and confrontations
While Herakles was living at Trachis, AIGIMIOS, son of Doros, the king of the
Dorians, invited him to assist the Dorians in a border-war against a neighbouring
people, the Lapiths (see p. 554), promising him a share of the kingdom as a reward.
As their proximity to the Lapiths would indicate, the Dorians were living in northern
Thessaly at this time prior to their arrival in Doris (see above). After marching north
with some Arcadian followers, Herakles helped to defeat the Lapiths, killing their
leader, Koronos, son of Kaineus, with his own hand. He refused to take the promised
reward, however, asking instead that it should be kept in trust for his descendants.
An enduring bond was established as a consequence between the Dorians and the
hero’s sons and descendants, the Heraklids, who would ultimately lead the Dorians
to their ﬁnal home in the Peloponnese.221
During his return journey, Herakles became involved in two individual confronta-
tions. His ﬁrst opponent, KYKNOS, was a brutal son of Ares who used to challenge
passing strangers to single combat, and, in some accounts at least, would cut off
their heads to use their skulls to construct a temple of Ares (or Apollo).222 In the
earliest surviving account in the Hesiodic Shield, Kyknos confronted Herakles and
his charioteer Iolaos at the grove of Apollo at Pagasai (the port of Iolkos on the
northern tip of the Gulf of Pagasai) with the intention of robbing them of their
splendid armour;223 but Herakles, whose ardour was ﬁred up by Apollo, felled him
— The life of Herakles —
282

in the resulting duel with a spear-throw to the neck.224 When Ares then tried to
avenge the death of his son, Athena turned his spear aside as it was ﬂying through
the air, and Herakles forced him to the ground in the single combat that followed,
with a spear-thrust to the thigh.225 Keux saw to the burial of Kyknos (here described
as his son-in-law), but Apollo caused his grave and memorial to be washed away
by the river Anauros because he had plundered the god’s offerings during his life-
time.226 Some later accounts locate the episode at Itonos in south-eastern Thessaly;227
and Zeus is sometimes said to have put a stop to the ﬁght between Ares and Herakles
by hurling a thunderbolt between them.228 In a version ascribed to Stesichorus,
Herakles ﬂed from the initial confrontation because Kyknos was aided by his father,
but later caught Kyknos on his own and killed him.229
The second of these stories, which tells of Herakles’ confrontation with the king
of Ormenion (near Mt Pelion), is of lesser interest and probably of later origin.
According to Diodorus, who names the king as Ormenios and is the ﬁrst author to
report the story, Herakles asked to marry his daughter, Astydameia, but was turned
down on the wholly reasonable ground that he already had a legitimate wife in
Deianeira; so the hero took matters into his own hands by killing the king, capturing
his city and seizing his daughter. Or in Apollodorus’ version, in which the king is
named Amyntor, Herakles killed him when he was rash enough to try to prevent
the hero from passing through his territory.230
Herakles now decided that the time had come for him to exact his long-delayed
revenge on Eurytos, who had refused to surrender his daughter Iole to him after he
had won her in an archery-contest (see p. 273). As has been mentioned, there was
no settled tradition on the location of Eurytos’ city of Oichalia, for it was variously
identiﬁed with places in Arcadia, Messenia, north-western Thessaly and Euboea.
Since it apparently lay no great distance by sea from Trachis, and Herakles stopped
off at the north-western cape of Euboea during his return voyage, the Euboean 
site seems most plausible in connection with the present story. In that case, the city
would have been situated near Eretria in the east-central region of the island, oppo-
site southern Boeotia. The early epic poet Creophylus placed Eurytos’ city in Euboea
in his lost poem the Sack of Oichalia, as does Sophocles in the Trachinian Women.231
Herakles assembled a large force for the enterprise, consisting of his own Arcadian
followers and men from the surrounding area (i.e. Malians from the region of Trachis
and Eastern Locrians). On arriving in Euboea, he soon captured Oichalia, killing
Eurytos and all his surviving sons. The most notable losses on his own side were
Argeios and Melas, two sons of his uncle Likymnios, and Hippasos, a son of Keux.
After seeing to their burial and plundering the city, he set off for Trachis, taking
Iole, the daughter of the dead king with him on his ship.232
Hyginus records an unsavoury tale in which Herakles tried to force Iole to marry him by
threatening to kill her relations; but she continued to refuse him even though he proceeded
to kill them one after another in front of her.233 According to another tale, Likymnios was
initially unwilling to allow his young son Argeios to join the expedition, but relented when
Herakles swore to bring him home again; and he fulﬁlled the letter of his promise at least
by cremating the body of the young man after his death and bringing his ashes home in
an urn.234

The death and apotheosis of Herakles
In the course of his return voyage, Herakles called in at Cape Kenaion at the south-
western tip of Euboea to offer a sacriﬁce to his father Zeus. He was unable to proceed
with it at once, however, because he lacked the proper clothing, and he sent his
herald LICHAS ahead to Trachis to fetch some ceremonial robes. While fulﬁlling
his task, Lichas happened to mention to Deianeira that her husband was bringing
Iole home with him as a captive; or he even told her that Herakles was in love with
the princess. Alarmed by this unwelcome news, Deianeira called to mind the
supposed love-potion that she had acquired by collecting blood and semen of the
dying Centaur Nessos (see p. 281). As we saw above, Nessos had told her that this
mixture would ensure the ﬁdelity of her husband, but it was in fact a virulent poison
because the Centaur’s blood had been contaminated with hydra’s venom from
Herakles’ arrow. Taking Nessos at his word, however, Deianeira rubbed some of it
into her husband’s robes before passing them on to Lichas. When Herakles put on
the robes and approached the ﬁre to make his intended sacriﬁce, the poison was
activated by the heat of the ﬂames and began to burn into his skin, causing him
unendurable pain.235
In the rather different account in Sophocles’ Trachinian Women, Lichas travelled to Trachis
ahead of his master, bringing Iole with him along with other female captives from Oichalia;
and Deianeira sent the robes to Herakles on her own initiative rather than in response to a
message from her husband.236 It is stated in this play that Herakles and his family had been
exiled from Tiryns to Trachis as a result of the murder of Iphitos.237 Bacchylides relates in
one of his odes that Herakles stopped at Kenaion to sacriﬁce some of his spoils after burning
Oichalia, intending to offer nine bulls to Zeus Kenaios, two to Poseidon, and an unyoked
heifer to Athena; on hearing that Herakles was sending Iole to his house to become his wife,
Deianeira sent the poisoned robe to him as usual.238
Supposing that Lichas was to blame for his sufferings, Herakles lifted him up by
his feet and hurled him over the cliffs into the sea below;239 as he was falling through
the air, Lichas became petriﬁed with fear, and turned into a rock that could be 
seen off the coast ever afterwards. Sailors took care not to step on it, as if it would
be pained by their tread.240 This story may have been inspired by the presence of
some small islands off the coast called the Lichades.241 Herakles tried to relieve
himself of his pain by tearing off the poisoned tunic (or ‘shirt of Nessos’ as it is
sometimes called), but this merely increased his agony since the fabric had become
stuck to his skin and he pulled strips of his ﬂesh along with it. As the poison burned
down to his bones, he was carried into the ship and conveyed back to Trachis; and
when Deianeira saw the effect of her action, she hanged herself (or stabbed herself)
in remorse.242
Now believing that death was the only remedy available to him, Herakles made
his way – or had himself carried – west from Trachis to the summit of Mt Oeta,
where he constructed a pyre and climbed on to it.243 Or else the pyre was constructed
by Hyllos at his father’s order, either on his own or with the help of his brothers.244
Or in Diodorus’ account, Likymnios and Iolaos travelled to Delphi at Herakles’ order
to enquire about a cure, but were told instead that they should build a pyre for
— The life of Herakles —
284

him on the mountain and arrange for him to be carried there with his arms 
and armour.245 When Herakles climbed on to the pyre and asked the bystanders to
set light to it, no one dared to do so until Poias, the father of the great archer
Philoktetes, happened to pass by while searching for his ﬂocks and agreed to apply
a torch to the wood. Herakles rewarded him by giving him his bow and arrows,
which would later be used by Philoktetes at Troy; or in other accounts, Philoktetes
lit the pyre and so received the bow and arrows from the hero himself.246
In the earliest tradition, Herakles died and departed to Hades just like any other
mortal. Achilles remarks accordingly in the Iliad that he is willing to accept death
whenever the gods bring it on him, ‘for not even the mighty Herakles could escape
death, very dear though he was to lord Zeus, son of Kronos, but fate overcame him
and the dreadful anger of Hera’;247 and Odysseus sees him among the shades of the
dead in the Odyssey, causing all the other shades to scatter like birds as he advances
with an arrow in his bow, glaring ﬁercely around him as if about to shoot. Three
lines are inserted, indeed, into the text of the Odyssey to explain that this was simply
a phantom since the true Herakles was up above with the gods, but this is 
clearly an interpolation that was added to reconcile the Homeric account with later

belief.248 The lines in the Theogony that refer to Herakles’ presence on Olympos can
be regarded as being of later origin likewise, belonging as they do to a section of
the poem that was almost certainly added after Hesiod’s time.249 Although it is
hard to tell exactly when Herakles was ﬁrst thought to have become a god, the
evidence from the visual arts suggests that the idea of his ascent to heaven had
established itself by the beginning of the sixth century BC. In Attic vase-paintings
from that and the following century, he can regularly be seen climbing into a chariot,
driven by Athena, Hermes or some other deity, to make his ascent to the home of
the gods, or else rising into the air in a chariot as the pyre blazes below, or walking
into the presence of the gods at the end of his journey. In literary accounts, he is
said to have been raised up to heaven to the accompaniment of thunder by a cloud
that passed under him as he sat on his pyre, or to have been carried up to heaven
by Zeus in a four-horse chariot.250 According to a notion that is ﬁrst attested in
the Hellenistic period, all that was mortal in him was burned away by the ﬂames,
leaving only the divine part that he had inherited from his father Zeus.251 Diodorus
reports no deﬁnite wonder, merely stating that the pyre was wholly consumed as
the result of a lightning-strike, and that it was assumed that Herakles had entered
the company of the gods because his bones were nowhere to be found.252
After Herakles was welcomed into the company of the gods on Olympos, Hera
agreed to be reconciled with him at last, and allowed him to marry her daughter
Hebe, the goddess of youth, in a union that symbolized his overcoming of age and
death.253 It is reported in one source that Hebe bore two sons to him, Alexiares
and Aniketos,254 but these are insubstantial ﬁgures whose names are based on cultic
titles of Herakles. Some claimed that Hera formally adopted him as her son through
a ceremonial re-enactment of his birth, by lying on a bed, drawing him close to her
body, and allowing him to fall through her robes to the ground. Or in another story
of the kind, she adopted him by offering him her breast.255 After his eventful life
as a hero, he now enjoyed the timeless existence of a god, which was doubtless very
pleasant for him but leaves little for his biographer to report.
THE RETURN OF THE HERAKLIDS
Eurystheus meets his own death while trying to eliminate 
the Heraklids
The subsequent adventures of the sons and descendants of Herakles and Deianeira
form an important saga, that of the return of the Heraklids (Herakleidai), which
provided a mythological account of the Dorian invasion of the Peloponnese.
Although Eurystheus tried to destroy the family of Herakles after the hero’s death,
he and his sons were killed during the ensuing conﬂict, and the Heraklids then
assumed the offensive by trying to invade the Peloponnese. With Eurystheus and
his sons out of the way, they could lay claim to Mycenae and the Perseid lands of
the Argolid by virtue of Herakles’ Perseid descent; and since Herakles had settled
the succession at the other main centre in the Peloponnese, at Sparta (see p. 279)
and at Pylos (see p. 278), which was then the ruling city of Messenia, they could
— The life of Herakles —
286

seek to establish themselves as the overlords of much of the peninsula. Their initial
hopes were frustrated, however, and their ﬁnal conquest of the Peloponnese 
was delayed until well after the Trojan War (ﬁfty years after in most accounts). As
a result of the alliance that Herakles had established with the Dorians (see p. 282),
the Heraklids were supported in the enterprise by a mainly Dorian invasion force;
and since the Dorians, who were known to have lived in the north in the earliest
times, could have had no prior claim to any territory in the Peloponnese, this legend,
which presents them as having been led by Heraklids who founded the royal lines
in the conquered lands, provided a mythical justiﬁcation for their occupation of this
new territory.
We should not expect to discover anything of value about the historical move-
ment of peoples from this body of legend (any more than from the legendary account
of the Ionian settlement of Asia Minor, see p. 408). The saga of the Heraklids seems
to have been no more than a mythical construction, and there is good reason to
suppose, furthermore, that the story of the Dorian invasion was ﬁrst brought into
connection with the myth of the return of the Heraklids at a secondary stage. It
should be remembered, moreover, that the migration of the Dorians to the Dorian
areas of the Peloponnese would not have been an invasion at all in the strict sense,
but a very gradual process.
Although all the children and descendants of Herakles could be described as Heraklids (just
as descendants of Inachos were Inachids), the name was generally used in reference to the
descendants of Herakles and Deianeira who entered the Peloponnese. The Greek name for
their ‘return’, kathodos, was doubly suitable, since it could mean both a return and a descent;
by descending from Central Greece into the Peloponnese, the Heraklids were returning to
the land of their forebears.
When Herakles was no longer available to protect his sons, Eurystheus attempted
to eliminate them so as to ensure that his own branch of the family would main-
tain its dominance in the Perseid lands of the Argolid. The Heraklids initially sought
refuge with Keux at Trachis, but he was not sufﬁciently powerful to protect them
in the face of threats from Eurystheus,256 and they were obliged to ﬂee southward
to Athens, where they claimed sanctuary by seating themselves on the altar of Eleos
(Pity or Mercy personiﬁed). The Athenians, who were ruled at this time by Theseus
(or his son Demophon), not only refused to deliver them to Eurystheus when he
arrived in pursuit, but offered to ﬁght at their side in the conﬂict that ensued.257
When an oracle then declared that Athens would be assured of victory if a daughter
of Herakles (or simply a high-born maiden) volunteered to be sacriﬁced, Makaria,
the only daughter of Herakles and Deianeira, offered herself for sacriﬁce or took her
own life.258 Eurystheus was duly defeated in the ﬁerce battle that followed, losing
all his sons; but he escaped in his chariot and tried to ﬂee home by way of the
Isthmus of Corinth. He was overtaken, however, in the Megarid by Hyllos or Iolaos,
and was captured or immediately killed. In one version of the story, Hyllos, the
eldest son of Herakles and Deianeira, decapitated him and took his head back to
Alkmene, who gouged out his eyes with weaving-pins;259 or according to Euripides’
surviving play on the matter, the Heraklids, Eurystheus was captured by Iolaos, the

ageing nephew of Herakles, who returned him in chains to Attica, where Alkmene
ordered his death. Euripides reports that Iolaos had prayed to Zeus and Hebe to be
rejuvenated for a day to enable him to exact revenge on Eurystheus.260 A tradition
at Thebes suggested, indeed, that Iolaos was dead by this time and was allowed to
rise from his grave for the purpose.261
The return of the Heraklids is delayed until well after 
the Trojan War
Although the Heraklids could now believe that they were in a position to return
to their ancestral homeland in the Peloponnese, it was the will of the gods that
their return should be delayed for many decades. This could hardly have been other-
wise, since Herakles was known to have died before the Trojan War and it was
equally well-established that Mycenae and Sparta were under Pelopid rule at the
time of the war and for some time afterwards. Two main stories were offered to
explain how the return of the Heraklids came to be delayed for such a long period.
In the simpler account, which is already mentioned by Herodotus, Hyllos, son of
Herakles, fought in single combat against a Peloponnesian champion when the
Heraklids ﬁrst tried to invade the Peloponnese, and the Heraklids stayed away for
ﬁfty or a hundred years (i.e. the full period of the delay) after his defeat in accord-
ance with the terms of the duel; or in a more elaborate account which is best recorded
by Apollodorus, an oracle ordered their withdrawal after they ﬁrst entered the
Peloponnese, and they met with defeat in successive generations thereafter when
their misinterpretation of subsequent oracles encouraged them to invade before the
proper time. The latter version indicates most clearly that the delay was no mere
accident but was providentially ordained.
To start with the simpler version of the story, the Heraklids tried to force their
way into the Peloponnese soon after the death of Eurystheus, but were confronted
by a Peloponnesian army at the Isthmus of Corinth. To avoid unnecessary blood-
shed, the leader of the expedition, HYLLOS, proposed that the issue should be
settled by single combat between himself and a champion from the opposing army.
As the sworn conditions of the duel, it was agreed that the Heraklids would be
allowed to reclaim their ancestral rights in the Peloponnese if Hyllos won, but would
attempt no further invasion of the Peloponnese for a hundred years (or ﬁfty years)
if he were defeated. ECHEMOS, the king of Tegea in Arcadia, volunteered to ﬁght
on behalf of the Peloponnesians and killed Hyllos in the ensuing ﬁght. So the
Heraklids were obliged to withdraw, and stayed away until the agreed period had
elapsed. Most of the Heraklids in the intervening generations lived as guests of the
Dorians in Doris in Central Greece.262
In the other main version of the legend, the Heraklids were successful in their
ﬁrst invasion of the Peloponnese and captured most of its main cities; but a plague
broke out a year afterwards, and an oracle declared that this had come about because
the Heraklids had returned before the proper time. So they withdrew to Attica and
settled at Marathon for the present. Whether by the same or a different oracle, the
former subjects of Eurystheus at Mycenae were instructed to choose a Pelopid as
their new ruler. It happened that Atreus and Thyestes, two sons of Pelops, were
— The life of Herakles —
288

living in the area after being exiled by their father, and Atreus won the throne after
a bitter contest with his brother (see further on pp. 505ff). His accession marked
the beginning of a period of Pelopid rule in the two greatest cities of the Pelopon-
nese, initially at Mycenae and later at Sparta; see Chapter 14. After leading the
Heraklids back out of the Peloponnese, Hyllos consulted the Delphic oracle, which
stated that they should wait ‘until the third harvest’ before returning. Naturally
assuming that this meant three years, Hyllos waited for that period and invaded
the Peloponnese once again, only to be killed, apparently by Echemos at the Isthmus
of Corinth as above. In this version, however, the Heraklids could not have sworn
to stay away for a hundred years if he were killed, for the descendants of Hyllos led
invasions in each successive generation until they ﬁnally succeeded.
After a short gap owing to the defective nature of our sources, we can pick up
the story again as Hyllos’ grandson, ARISTOMACHOS, son of Kleodaios, was
consulting the Delphic oracle about a fresh invasion. On being told that the inva-
sion would succeed if the Heraklids approached the Peloponnese ‘by the narrow
route’, Aristomachos led them across the narrow Isthmus of Corinth, but was
defeated and killed nonetheless. When Aristomachos’ eldest son, TEMENOS, came
of age, he consulted the Delphic oracle once again (in the company of his two
brothers in one account), and was surprised to receive the same advice as before. On
further questioning, the god explained that the Heraklids had brought their previous
misfortunes on themselves by misinterpreting his oracles. For when he had spoken
of the third harvest, he had meant the third generation of men rather than the third
harvest of the earth; and when he had spoken of the narrow route, he had meant
the short sea-route across the narrow Gulf of Corinth rather than the land-route
across the narrow Isthmus. Since Temenos and his brother belonged to the third
generation after Hyllos and were now aware of the proper route, they could make
preparations in the conﬁdent belief that success lay within their grasp.263
The Heraklids invade the Peloponnese with their Dorian allies
and draw lots for the three main kingdoms
Temenos assembled an army at Naupaktos on the northern shores of the Corinthian
Gulf, and constructed a ﬂeet of ships to ferry them across to the Peloponnesian
coast.264 The force consisted of Dorians for the most part. While it was still at
Naupaktos, a priest of Apollo, Karnos by name, arrived there and wandered among
the troops delivering oracles in an inspired frenzy. Although he meant no harm,
they took him for a sorcerer who had been sent by the enemy to cause their destruc-
tion. So Hippotes, son of Phylas, one of the Heraklids, killed him with his spear,
provoking Apollo to afﬂict the army with a famine and cause the destruction of the
ﬂeet. When Temenos sought the advice of the Delphic oracle, he was told that the
murderer should be banished for ten years and that the Heraklids should take ‘the
three-eyed one’ as their guide.265 The meaning of the latter words remained a
mystery to them until they came across a man riding on a one-eyed horse (or driving
a one-eyed mule). This was OXYLOS, son of Andraimon, a member of the Aetolian
royal family who had been exiled for killing his brother or some other person and
was now returning home after spending a year in Elis; his horse had only a single

eye because it had been struck in the other by an arrow. He agreed to act as guide
to the Heraklids and their Dorian allies, and advised that they should make their
crossing further to the west, starting at Molykrion.266 After they arrived in the
Peloponnese, he conducted them through Arcadia to attack TEISAMENOS, son of
Orestes, the last Pelopid ruler of Argos and Sparta. The Peloponnesians were defeated
as the oracle had foretold, and Teisamenos himself was either killed in battle or
escaped to Aigialos (Achaea) on the north coast, where he was killed soon after-
wards nonetheless (see p. 407). The Heraklids were then able to take possession of
the main centres in the Peloponnese.267
As a reward for his services, Oxylos asked to be granted the throne of Elis in the north-western
Peloponnese; since the Aetolian royal family had originally come from Elis (see pp. 411–12),
his rule had a certain legitimacy.268 Another region of the Peloponnese that never came under
Heraklid rule was Arcadia, because its ruler, Kypselos, reached an accommodation with the
Heraklids by means of a marriage-alliance (see p. 549).
The important city of Corinth, which was still ruled by descendants of its Deukalionid
founder Sisyphos (see p. 430), acquired a Heraklid ruler and a Dorian population within a
generation of the return of the Heraklids. Hippotes, son of Phylas, the Heraklid who was
banished for killing the seer at Naupaktos (see above), fathered a son ALETES (Wanderer)
during his subsequent wanderings; and when Aletes came of age, he attacked Corinth with a
force of Dorians and put the Corinthians to ﬂight after worsting them in battle. The Sisyphid
rulers, Doridas and Hyanthidas, then submitted to him and were allowed to remain in the
city. Aletes and his descendants ruled at Corinth for ﬁve generations until the monarchy 
was displaced by the Bacchiad oligarchy (in 747 BC according to the traditional reckon-
ing).269 After seizing control of Corinth, Aletes also tried to conquer Attica, but was foiled
by the self-sacriﬁce of Kodros, the last king of Athens (see p. 376). Sicyon, Corinth’s neigh-
bour to the west, was also said to have been conquered by a Heraklid, in this case Phalkes,
son of Temenos; since the king of Sicyon, a certain Lakestades, was descended from a son of
Herakles, Phalkes allowed him to share the throne.270
After completing their conquest of the Peloponnese, the Heraklid leader cast lots
to determine who should win the three main kingdoms of Sparta, Argos and
Messenia. The senior Heraklids of this generation were Temenos, Kresphontes
and Aristodemos, the three great-grandsons of Hyllos, son of Herakles (see Table
6); but Aristodemos was usually said to have been killed before the ﬁnal invasion.
Apollodorus states without further detail that he was killed by a thunderbolt while
the army was at Naupaktos; or else he was murdered at Delphi by Medon and
Strophios, sons of Pylades and Elektra, two cousins of Teisamenos whose family had
good reason to fear the ambitions of the Heraklids.271 Whatever the exact circum-
stances of his death, he was represented at the draw by his twin sons Prokles and
Eurysthenes. This was the usual story at least; but the Spartans had their own ideas
on the matter, as we shall see. Kresphontes was so anxious to gain possession of
Messenia, the fertile south-western region of the Peloponnese, that he rigged the
draw in his own favour. For after it had been agreed that the three parties should
cast their lots into a water-jug, Kresphontes proposed that the ﬁrst lots should be
drawn for Sparta and Argos, leaving Messenia for the one whose lot remained in
the jug; and he tossed a ball of compacted earth into the jug as his own lot rather
— The life of Herakles —
290

than a pebble, so ensuring that the other lots would be drawn because his own
would dissolve in the water.272 This tale was devised to justify (or at least account
for) the division of power in the Peloponnese from the seventh century BC onwards
when Messenia fell under Spartan control; for it could be claimed in terms of the
myth that the Heraklid rulers of Messenia eventually lost their ill-gotten gains to
legitimate claimants.
In another account of the ruse of Kresphontes, the Dorians awarded Argos to Temenos (appar-
ently on the ground that the best kingdom should go to the eldest brother), and Kresphontes
asked that he should be allowed to choose Messenia since he too was of elder birth than
Aristodemos. His wish was opposed, however, by Theras (see p. 329), who was representing
the young sons of the dead Aristodemos, and he therefore resorted to a ruse to achieve his
desire. After ﬁrst persuading Temenos to collude with him, he proposed that the issue should
be settled by a draw. Temenos then put two lots into a water-jug, one for the sons of
Aristodemos and one for Kresphontes, on the agreement that the party whose lot was picked
out should choose between the remaining kingdoms. Now Temenos had made both lots out
of clay, but he had baked that of Kresphontes in a ﬁre while he had merely dried the other in
the sun; so when they were put into the water, the latter dissolved, and Kresphontes’ lot was
certain to be picked out. This version also provides a mythical explanation for the long-lasting
hostility between Sparta and Argos, which could be said to have taken its start from Temenos’
deception.273
The Heraklid rulers of Sparta, Messenia and Argos; 
the exile of Tlepolemos
As a result of the draw, however unsatisfactory it may have been, Temenos became
the ﬁrst Heraklid king of Argos, and Kresphontes that of Messenia, while Sparta was
allotted to Prokles and Eurysthenes, the infant sons of Aristodemos. As the brother
of Aristodemos’ wife, Theras, son of Autesion, who was descended from the kings of
Thebes, ruled Sparta as regent until the sons of Aristodemos came of age (see p. 571).
The Spartans differed from most other Greeks in believing that Aristodemos had
survived to become the ﬁrst Heraklid king of their land. In that case, he fathered
Prokles and Eurysthenes in Sparta shortly before his death; and when he died, it was
decided that the twins should become the joint rulers of the land because they were
indistinguishable and there was no way of telling which was the elder.274 Whether
they inherited the throne in these circumstances or it was allotted to them after their
father’s death as in the usual tradition, their joint assumption of the throne provided
a mythical explanation for the peculiar institution of the dual monarchy at Sparta. 
As seems ﬁtting, they married twin sisters, Lathria and Anaxandra, daughters of the
Heraklid Thersandros, son of Agamedides.275 The Agiad royal house, which was
accorded a certain precedence in ceremonial matters at least, traced its descent to
Eurysthenes through his son Agis, while the Eurypontid royal house traced its descent
to the other twin Prokles, through his grandson Eurypon, son of Soas. In accordance
with the common pattern in which mythical twins are either the best of friends or
worst of enemies, Prokles and Eurysthenes were said to have quarrelled throughout
their lives, hence the discord that often prevailed between the two royal houses in
historical times.276

The ﬁrst Heraklid rulers of Messenia and Argos both met violent ends. KRES-
PHONTES married Merope, the daughter of Kypselos, king of Arcadia, who bore
him three sons; but he was killed along with two of his sons when another Heraklid,
Polyphontes, mounted a revolt against him and seized the Messenian throne. His
younger son Aipytos (or Kresphontes) survived, however, either because he was being
reared in Arcadia by Kypselos or because his mother sent him away to Kypselos in
secret at the time of the revolt. In the early account from Euripides’ Kresphontes, so
far as it can be reconstructed from fragments and other records, Polyphontes was
aware that the child, here called Kresphontes, had survived, and promised a reward
of gold to anyone who would kill him; but he grew up unharmed and later returned
to Messenia to avenge his father’s death. He approached Polyphontes under a false
name and told him that he had come to claim the reward for having killed the
prince. While he was sleeping as a guest in the palace, his mother Merope, who
had been forced into marriage with Polyphontes in the mean time, entered his room
with an axe to kill him in the belief that he had murdered her son; but an old
servant who was aware of his true identity warned her just in time. She then made
a show of friendliness to Polyphontes and suggested that their guest should be
invited to assist at a sacriﬁce; and when the young man was given a sword for that
purpose, he plunged it into Polyphontes and so recovered his father’s kingdom.277
Or in another version, the son of the murdered king, here called Aipytos, as is usual
in the later tradition, returned openly to Messenia and recovered the throne by force
with the help of some Arcadian allies and other Peloponnesian kings.278 Aipytos
gained such a reputation among rich and poor alike for his just rule that the
Messenian kings were known as Aipytids rather than Heraklids from that time
onward.279 The line was destined to be extinguished, however, at a relatively early
period when the Spartans established their domination over the land.
In his kingdom at Argos, TEMENOS provoked trouble within his own family
by favouring Deiphontes, the Heraklid husband of his daughter Hyrnetho, above
his three sons. Fearing for their inheritance, the sons of Temenos plotted the murder
of their father. This achieved nothing for them in one version of the story, since
the Argives were so shocked by their crime that they drove them out and assigned
the kingdom to Hyrnetho and her husband;280 or in another version, Keisos, the
eldest son of Temenos, took over the throne, and Deiphontes withdrew to Epidauros
with many Argive followers.281 As a matter of historical fact, the monarchy at Argos
was not a long-lasting institution like the dual monarchy at Sparta. According to
Pausanias’ account of the legendary tradition, the Argives reduced the authority of
the monarchy at such an early period that even Medon, the son and successor of the
above-mentioned Keisos, was a monarch in no more than name, and the monarchy
itself was abolished nine generations later.282
The kings of Macedonia claimed to be Heraklids of Temenid descent. According to a tale from
Hyginus which was probably based on the lost Archelaos of Euripides, Archelaos, a son of
Temenos, was driven out of Argos by his brothers and travelled to the court of Kisseus, a
Macedonian king. Being under attack from neighbouring enemies at the time, Kisseus,
promised him his daughter and the kingdom if he would put his enemies to ﬂight. As he was
coming for his reward, however, after achieving this, Kisseus told his servants to prepare a
— The life of Herakles —
292

ﬁre-pit and cover it over with light branches so that Archelaos would fall into it and be killed.
In a more ancient myth, Ixion was said to have caused the death of his father-in-law by such
means (see p. 554); but in the present story the prospective victim received a warning from a
slave. On learning of the plot in this way, Archelaos lured the king to a private meeting 
and hurled him into his own ﬁre-pit. On the advice of an oracle, he left afterwards taking a
she-goat (aiga) as a guide and followed it to the site of Aigai, where he founded the royal
capital of Macedonia.283 This story may well have been invented by Euripides himself, who
spent the ﬁnal period of his life in Macedonia at the court of a historical Archelaos (reigned
c. 413–399 BC). Other tales which credit the founding of the monarchy to more distant
descendants of Temenos can be found in Herodotus and Diodorus.284
One further story is worthy of mention in connection with the Heraklids, the ancient
legend of the exile of the Heraklid TLEPOLEMOS, who was a son of Herakles by the
Epirote princess Astyoche (see p. 280), or by Astydameia, daughter of Amyntor.285
Homer already reports that he killed Likymnios, the maternal uncle of Herakles, and
was therefore obliged to depart into exile and built a ﬂeet of ships, gathered together
many followers, and sailed away to the island of Rhodes.286 Subsequent authors add
more details on the murder. According to Pindar, who locates the incident at Tiryns,
Tlepolemos struck Likymnios with an olive-wood staff as the latter was emerging
from the room of his mother Midea. This action was apparently committed in anger,
but the exact circumstances are not explained.287 In later accounts, Tlepolemos is said
to have struck his great-uncle accidentally, either while aiming a blow at a slave who
was leading the aged Likymnios along in a negligent manner, or because Likymnios
happened to get in the way while he was beating a slave.288 Apollodorus (who 
offers the latter version) states that the incident occurred when the Heraklids ﬁrst
invaded the Peloponnese shortly after the death of Eurystheus; or in another account,
the citizens of Argos invited Tlepolemos and Likymnios to their city while the 
other Heraklids were excluded after the death of Hyllos, and the accidental killing
took place in Argos after they had settled there.289 Tlepolemos sailed away to Rhodes
after the killing at the order of the Delphic oracle,290 accompanied by many Dorian
followers, and founded the island’s three great Dorian cities, Lindos, Ialysos and
Kameiros.291 He amassed wealth and power in his new homeland, and later led the
Rhodian contingent to the Trojan War in nine ships. The Iliad describes how he was
killed in battle by the Lycian hero Sarpedon.292

THE MYTHICAL HISTORY 
OF THEBES

THE FOUNDATION AND EARLY HISTORY 
OF THEBES
T
he great city of Thebes in southern Boeotia, which ranked with Argos as the
most important centre in mythical Greece, was ruled by the second main branch
of the Inachid family. As was explained above (see p. 231), an early Argive princess,
Io, a descendant (or even daughter) of the Argive river-god Inachos, wandered far
away from her native Argos to settle in Egypt; and in that land, her granddaughter
Libye subsequently bore twin sons to Poseidon called Belos and Agenor, who 
were the founders of the two principal branches of the family. Danaos, a son of
Belos, returned to his ancestral homeland of Argos to found its Belid ruling line
(see p. 233), while Kadmos and Europa, two children of Agenor who were born
in Phoenicia where their father had settled, were destined to found the Agenorid
ruling lines at Thebes and Crete respectively. We will follow the history of Kadmos’
Theban line in the present chapter before returning to Europa and her descendants
on Crete in the next.
Agenor sends Kadmos and his other sons in search 
of Europa
To pick up the story of AGENOR where we left off in Chapter 7, he emigrated 
from Egypt to Phoenicia on the easternmost shore of the Mediterranean, where he
founded a kingdom of his own and married Telephassa (of unrecorded parentage) or
Argiope, daughter of the Nile. She bore him a daughter, Europa, and various sons
including Kadmos, Phoinix, Kilix and Thasos.1 Europa grew up to be so beautiful
that she attracted the love of Zeus, who assumed the form of a bull to carry her across
the sea to Crete, where he fathered Minos and other sons by her (see pp. 337ff).
Mystiﬁed by her sudden disappearance, Agenor ordered his sons to set off in search
of her, telling them that they were not to return in any circumstances until they had
found her. They all failed in their search, however, and were therefore obliged to settle
abroad.2 Kilix, who is little more than an eponym, made his home in the south-
eastern province of Asia Minor that was known as Cilicia (Kilikia) thereafter, while
CHAPTER NINE
294

Phoinix settled in Phoenicia not far from where he had set off; or else he settled in
North Africa, which was a main centre of Phoenician colonization.3 We will be
primarily concerned with the travels of Kadmos, who set off with his mother
Telephassa and brother Thasos. They searched through much of the Aegean until
they arrived at Thrace on its northern shores, where Telephassa died; Thasos decided
to give up at this point, and settled on the island off the Thracian coast that would
bear his name ever afterwards. According to Herodotus, the famous gold-mines 
on the island were ﬁrst discovered by Phoenician followers of Thasos.4 During 
the preceding search, Kadmos had already established a Phoenician colony in the
southern Aegean on the island of Thera (see p. 571). After seeing to the funeral of his
mother and saying farewell to his brother, Kadmos decided to travel to Greece to
consult the Delphic oracle about the location of his sister.5
Conﬂicting genealogies are recorded for most members of this family. Europa is quite often
described as a child of Phoinix rather than of Agenor, as is Kadmos too on occasion. The Iliad
refers to Europa as such, and the same is reported of the Hesiodic Catalogue, which speciﬁed
that Phoinix was a son of Agenor and the father of Phineus.6 We cannot be sure from the
surviving evidence whether Kadmos was also a child of Phoinix in the Catalogue, or else a son
of Agenor and thus an uncle of Europa (as is perhaps more likely). In connection with the
search myth, Kadmos and Europa are always regarded as brother of and sister, and custom-
arily as children of Agenor.7 Thasos is variously described as a son of Agenor, Phoinix, Kilix
or Poseidon. Kepheus, king of Ethiopia, the father of Andromeda (see p. 240), was ﬁtted into
this family somewhere (as is understandable in view of the location of his kingdom), being
variously described as a son of Agenor, Phoinix or Belos; and the same is true of Phineus, the
uncle of Andromeda (see p. 242, not to be confused with the Thracian Phineus).8
Kadmos follows a cow to the site of Thebes, where he kills a
dragon and sows its teeth
Kadmos was told by the oracle that he should trouble himself no further about
Europa, but should take a cow as his guide, follow it until it sank down exhausted
on its right ﬂank (i.e. on the side of good omen), and then found a new city at that
spot. He discovered the special cow among the herds of a certain Pelagon, who lived
in Phocis somewhere to the east of Delphi. In one version of the story he was left
to discover it by his own devices as he was travelling away from Delphi, and picked
out a cow that was walking along on its own among the herds of Pelagon;9 or else
the oracle was more precise, telling him to seek the herds of Pelagon and then look
out for a particular cow that had a white mark resembling a full moon on each of
its ﬂanks.10 After ﬁnding it by whatever means, he followed it as it ambled east-
wards through Phocis and southern Boeotia until it ﬁnally sank to the ground at
the site of Thebes.
After discovering the location of his city by this means, Kadmos decided to offer
the cow in sacriﬁce to Athena (so inaugurating the Theban cult of Pallas Onka); or
else he had been instructed by the oracle to sacriﬁce the cow to the Earth after
reaching his goal.11 Before he could proceed with the ritual, he needed some lustral
water, and sent some of his companions to fetch it from a spring nearby. The spring
was sacred to the war-god Ares, however, and it was guarded by a fearsome dragon

that killed all or most of the men. As was usual with Greek dragons, which lacked
the legs and wings of our modern dragons (which are of medieval design), this
Theban dragon was pictured as large serpent; it was a son of Ares in one account
rather than merely his servant, a child borne to him by Erinys Tilphousa.12 On
learning of the fate of his companions, Kadmos set off to confront the dragon and
soon killed it, either by stabbing it with his sword or by striking it on the head
with a massive stone or by both means.13
On the advice of Athena, he collected the dragon’s teeth and sowed them in the
ground. A host of armed men, known as the SPARTOI or ‘Sown Men’, sprang up
from the teeth and proceeded to ﬁght among themselves until only ﬁve were left.14
They seem to have attacked one another of their own accord in the original story,
as a result of their innate aggressiveness; but there was also a quite early version 
in which Kadmos threw stones at them out of fear, causing them to ﬁght among
themselves in the belief that they were being pelted by one another.15 Be that as
it may, there were ﬁve Spartoi in the end named Echion, Oudaios, Chthonios,
Hyperenor and Peloros16 (i.e. Snake-man, Ground-man, Earth-man, Overweening
and Monstrous), who went on to found the noble families that would form the mili-
tary caste of the new city. Before founding the city, Kadmos had to serve Ares for
a year (or a great year, equivalent to eight ordinary years) to atone for having killed
the dragon.17
In other versions of the story of the dragon’s teeth, Athena sowed them with her own hands,
or Ares ordered their sowing or actually sowed them.18 Hellanicus offered an account in
which only ﬁve Spartoi sprang from the teeth in the ﬁrst place, and the initial battle was
thus eliminated;19 and he apparently stated that Ares would have killed Kadmos for slaying
the dragon if Zeus had not restrained him.20
The story of the sowing of the dragon’s teeth was recycled in Argonautic myth to provide
an ordeal for Jason (see p. 390). To account for the origin of the teeth that were sowed by
Jason (an event that must have occurred several generations after the lifetime of Kadmos), it
was explained that Kadmos sowed some of the teeth from the Theban dragon while the rest
were held back to be given to Aietes, who later handed them on to Jason to be sown.
Pherecydes stated, for instance, that Ares and Athena gave half of the teeth to Kadmos,
keeping the rest in reserve for Aietes; or else Aietes received a share of the teeth from
Athena.21 Misapprehensions can easily arise if one fails to keep in mind that Jason and
Kadmos were ordered to sow the teeth for entirely different reasons; for Aietes ordered Jason
to sow them to confront him with the perilous ordeal of killing the warriors who would spring
up from them, while Athena (or Ares) ordered Kadmos to do so to provide him with useful
citizens for his city. It was not in Kadmos’ interest to kill them; and even in the variant
mentioned above in which he provoked them to attack one another by throwing stones at
them, he threw the stones in panic rather with the conscious intention of provoking a ﬁght.
Jason, on the other hand, adopted this as a deliberate stratagem on the advice of Medeia, to
ensure that the armed men would be reduced in number before he attacked them directly.
This motif of the stone-throwing would have originated in the Argonautic myth.
Although Apollodorus’ summary of the foundation legend is drawn from good early sources
for the most part, it is misleading in so far as it suggests that Kadmos underwent his servi-
tude to Ares for having killed the Spartoi (rather than the Theban dragon);22 this unhappy
idea can be put aside as an error. Even if Ares’ anger at the killing of the dragon would have
been fully allayed by Kadmos’ servitude in the original legend, the theme was too useful not
— The mythical history of Thebes —
296

to be reapplied in other connections, whether to account for Kadmos’ subsequent trans-
formation into a snake (see p. 300), or the sending of the Sphinx, or the need for an act of
self-sacriﬁce if Thebes was to be defended from the Seven (see p. 330).
Kadmos marries the goddess Harmonia and founds Thebes
Ares was reconciled with Kadmos after his servitude was completed, and Zeus
granted him a goddess as a wife, namely HARMONIA, the daughter of Ares and
Aphrodite. All the Olympian gods descended from heaven to attend the wedding,
which was celebrated on the Kadmeia, the acropolis of the new city; and the Muses
themselves sang the marriage-hymns, accompanied by Apollo or the Charites (Graces)
in some accounts.23 Many splendid gifts were presented to the bride, most notably a
divine necklace and robe (peplos) which would be much coveted in future times and
become a source of sorrow to their owners. The robe was usually said to have been a
gift from Athena, while the necklace, which had naturally been made by Hephaistos,
was presented either by her or by Aphrodite. Or else the necklace was a gift from the
bridegroom, who had acquired it either from its maker or from Europa (who had
originally received it as a present from Zeus (see p. 337); this latter version, from
Pherecydes, departs from the usual tradition by suggesting that Kadmos did meet 
his sister at some stage after her abduction to Crete).24 Pindar cites this marriage 
along with that of Peleus – who married another goddess, Thetis (see p. 52) – as an
illustration of the highest blessing that could be attained by a mortal man; but the
poet refers to this peak of their good fortune to make a deeper point, that no mortal
can expect to live a life that is free from reverses, for Kadmos and Peleus were both
destined to meet with their full share of misfortune.25 The sorrows of Kadmos arose
mainly from the tribulations of his children, as we will see shortly, while Peleus was
soon deserted by his wife, who thought it shameful to be yoked to a mortal, and lost
his only son prematurely. In his marriage at least, however, Kadmos was indeed
supremely fortunate, for Harmonia’s attitude was very different from that of Thetis
and the union proved to be happy and long-lasting.
Kadmos founded Thebes by building the upper city with the help of the Spartoi
on the Theban acropolis, which was known as the Kadmeia. Thebes had two 
separate foundation-legends since it was sometimes said to have been founded by
Zethos and Amphion, who belonged to another family; but the two legends were
reconciled in the usual tradition by means of a division of labour, in which Kadmos
was said to have built the upper city while Zethos and Amphion built or fortiﬁed
the lower city at a later time (see further on p. 305). The house of Kadmos 
and bridal-chamber of Harmonia could be seen on the acropolis in historical 
times, as could the spot where the Muses were supposed to have sung during their 
wedding-feast.26
According to some Hellenistic accounts, Harmonia was mortal rather than divine, as a
daughter of Zeus by a mortal mother, Elektra, daughter of Atlas. In that case, she was the
sister of Iasion and Dardanos (see p. 521) and was brought up with them on the island of
Samothrace in the northern Aegean, where Kadmos happened to come across her during his
search for Europa. According to Ephorus, a historian of the fourth century BC, he abducted
her as he was sailing by, hence the origin of a local ceremony in which the islanders conducted

a ritual search for Elektra; or in Diodorus’ account, he married her at a formal wedding on
Samothrace, in the presence of the gods as in the traditional story of his marriage to the
goddess at Thebes.27 If it was accepted that Harmonia was a child of Elektra, it could be
explained that the Elektran gates at Thebes were named after her mother (although another
story suggested that they were named after a sister of Kadmos).28
The Greeks commonly explained the origin of their alphabet by saying that Kadmos had
introduced it from Phoenicia. There were rival legends, however, as is so often the case with
inventions, and some authors were naturally inclined to ascribe a purely Greek origin to the
art of writing. An ancient tradition, already found in Stesichorus and perhaps originating in
early Trojan epic, claimed this as one of the many inventions of the ingenious Palamedes (see
p. 459); in the Prometheus Bound, writing is listed among the arts that were invented by
Prometheus for the beneﬁt of the human race; or in another account, doubtless of Hellenistic
origin, the alphabet was invented by Aktaios, a primordial king of Athens, who named the
letters in honour of his daughter Phoinike. This Aktaion or Aktaios was the father-in-law of
Kekrops (see p. 365), who is also named as the inventor of the alphabet.29
The children of Kadmos and Harmonia; the death of Aktaion
The founder of Thebes and his divine consort had a son, Polydoros, and four daugh-
ters of far greater importance, Ino, Semele, Agave and Autonoe.30 Polydoros was
of genealogical signiﬁcance alone as a male heir who could serve to link the founder
of the city to the Labdakid dynasty (the family of Oedipus and Polyneikes), which
would originally have had no connection with Kadmos. It is reported that he was
sometimes known as Pinakos (Writing-tablet-man), evidently in reference to his
father’s service in introducing writing to Greece.31 As we shall see (p. 300), Kadmos
and Harmonia produced a further son, Illyrios, during their later years of exile.
The disasters that befell the daughters of Kadmos are mostly considered else-
where. Semele provoked her own destruction by making her lover Zeus promise to
visit her in his true divine form (see p. 171); she was pregnant at the time with
his son Dionysos, who was snatched from her womb and sewn into the thigh of
Zeus until it was time for him to be born. Ino and her husband Athamas reared
the infant Dionysos for a while, much to the anger of Hera, who punished them
by sending them mad and so caused the destruction of Ino and her two children
(see pp. 172 and 421). Agave married Echion, one of the ﬁve Spartoi, and bore him
a son Pentheus, who ruled Thebes for a short period as the successor of Kadmos.
She and her son were destined to suffer at the hand of Dionysos, who incited her
and other Theban women to tear Pentheus to pieces to punish him for having failed
to acknowledge his divinity (see p. 173). Autonoe for her part married a minor
rustic god, Aristaios (see p. 152), and bore him a single child, Aktaion, who died
early in horrifying circumstances, as must now be recounted.
AKTAION had a passion for hunting, liking nothing better than to roam through
the uplands of Boeotia with a pack of ﬁfty hounds. One day, however, while still
in the ﬂower of his youth, he caused great offence to Artemis, who turned him into
a stag and caused him to be hunted down by his own dogs. The most familiar
version of the story, both in modern times and in the later classical tradition, is
that which ﬁrst appears in Callimachus’ ﬁfth Hymn, in which the goddess is said to
have inﬂicted this punishment on him because he stumbled across her while she
— The mythical history of Thebes —
298

was naked. For as he was hunting one day on Mt Kithairon in southern Boeotia,
he entered the thickly wooded Gargaphian valley to seek some relief from the midday
heat; and it happened that Artemis had entered this valley, which was sacred to
her, with similar intent, and Aktaion came across her as she was bathing with her
attendant nymphs in a shady spring. The angry goddess threw some water into his
face, saying that he could now tell everyone that he had seen her naked, if he 
was able to. The meaning of her words became clear when horns began to sprout
from his head where the water had struck him and he gradually turned into a stag.
He retained his wits, however, and was fully aware of what he was about to suffer
as his dogs proceeded to hunt him down. Such is the story as recounted in the
earliest full narrative by Ovid; Callimachus offers no details.32 On the northern
slopes of Kithairon, travellers could see a rock known as Aktaion’s Couch (koite¯
Aktaio¯nos) on which the hero used to sleep when wearied by the hunt, and from
where he gained a fatal glimpse of Artemis as she was washing in a spring nearby.33
Some late authors suggest that the goddess had ample reason to punish Aktaion
because he was deliberately spying on her or even tried to rape her;34 Diodorus
already records a story of this kind, saying that he tried to make love to the goddess
at her temple after dedicating the ﬁrst fruits of his hunting to her.35
Aktaion incurred divine retribution for an entirely different reason in the earliest
accounts, by seeking to marry his aunt Semele even though she was loved by Zeus.
The early mythographer Acusilaus cited this as the reason for her transformation,
and the Hesiodic Catalogue can be presumed to have said the same (in spite of a
gap in the relevant papyrus, which preserves no more than the last two letters of
Semele’s name).36 Pausanias ascribes a similar version to Stesichorus, reporting rather
ambiguously that Artemis ‘threw a deerskin’ around Aktaion in the poem in ques-
tion to cause him to be hunted by his dogs, and so prevented from taking Semele
as his wife;37 it is not clear whether the disputable phrase should be interpreted
literally or as referring to a conventional transformation (as is surely more probable).
In the surviving literature, Euripides is the ﬁrst author to state that Artemis took
action against Aktaion for an offence committed against herself, in this case boasting
that he was a better hunter than her;38 the legend of Aktaion was dramatized in
early tragedy by Aeschylus and other authors, but virtually nothing is known about
how the story was presented by them.
The dogs of Aktaion attracted considerable attention in their own right; catalogues were
compiled of their names, and some authors liked to imagine how they would have reacted
on realizing that their master was missing (or indeed that they had killed him). Apollodorus
tells how they searched high and low for him, howling all the while, until their search
brought them to the cave of the Centaur Cheiron, who allayed their grief by fashioning an
image of their dead master; or according to a verse fragment which may have come from
the Hesiodic Catalogue, they were in a divinely inspired frenzy when they killed him, but
howled in distress when they became aware that he was dead, and shed warm tears for him.
Several authors report that Artemis inspired them with madness to cause them to kill their
master (even though this hardly seems necessary if he had already been turned into a stag).39
As for his mother Autonoe, she left Thebes forever in grief at his death and settled in the
Megarian village of Erenea, where her tomb could be seen in historical times.40 Her husband
Aristaios was said to have departed to Keos (see p. 177).

The exile and ultimate fate of Kadmos and Harmonia
Toward the end of their life, Kadmos and Harmonia left Thebes to live in exile in
Illyria, a wild region adjoining the Adriatic in the north-west.41 Whatever the orig-
inal signiﬁcance of this feature of their legend, it could easily be explained that
their departure was prompted by the many troubles of their family.42 It was
commonly said that Kadmos abdicated in his old age in favour of his grandson
Pentheus, the son of Agave, but remained in Thebes until his successor brought
further disaster on the family by opposing Dionysos and his orgiastic rites (see 
p. 173);43 after Pentheus met a grisly death as a consequence, Kadmos and Harmonia
departed in despair (or at the bidding of Dionysos), leaving the kingdom in the
hands of Polydoros, their only son. They travelled to Illyria in a cart drawn by two
yoked oxen (hence the name of the town of Bouthoe in Illyria, which was suppos-
edly founded by Kadmos and named as such because he and his wife had been drawn
there swiftly, thoo¯s, by oxen, bous).44 Two stories were put forward to explain how
Kadmos came to win a kingdom for himself in his new homeland. According to
Apollodorus, a war was in progress at the time between the Illyrians and the neigh-
bouring Encheleans or ‘Eel-people’, who were advised by an oracle that they would
defeat the Illyrians if they took Kadmos and Harmonia as their leaders; and after
the Illyrians were duly vanquished, Kadmos was able to establish himself as their
ruler.45 Or in a less creditable tale that is brieﬂy reported by Hyginus, Kadmos was
accompanied to Illyria by his daughter Agave, who married Lykotherses, king of
the Illyrians, and murdered him soon afterwards to secure the throne for her father.46
Kadmos and Harmonia produced a late-born son, ILLYRIOS, who gave his name
to the land and became the ancestor of its ruling family.47
In spite of her divine status, Harmonia was thought to have shared a common
end with her husband. There were two separate traditions on this matter which
were often combined, one suggesting that they were transferred to Elysion or the
Isles of the Blessed (homes for the privileged dead in the upper world, see p. 114),
and the other that they were transformed into snakes. Pindar mentions Kadmos
together with Peleus and Achilles among those who have been granted the privi-
lege of living in the Isles of the Blessed, as would be a ﬁtting end for a notable
hero who was married to a goddess; Menelaos is told correspondingly in the Odyssey
that he will be transferred to Elysion by the gods because he is a son-in-law of
Zeus.48 In a report that is vaguely ascribed to ‘the poets and mythographers’, a
Pindaric scholion states that Kadmos and Harmonia were conveyed to the Elysian
Fields on a chariot drawn by winged dragons.49 The story of their metamorphosis
ﬁrst appears in Euripides’ Bacchae and resurfaces in Hellenistic sources. Nicander
states that they lived in reptilian form ever after in the Illyrian province of Drileos,
creeping around as a pair of fearsome snakes, while Euripides offers a combined
version in which Ares transferred them to the Isles of the Blessed in their snake
form. Apollodorus states similarly that they were turned into snakes and sent to the
Elysian Fields by Zeus.50 It has long been recognized that the two motifs have much
the same signiﬁcance since the heroized dead were often thought to manifest them-
selves in snake-form. It would be interesting to know whether Kadmos and
Harmonia were ever thought to have lived on in snake-form as beneﬁcent deities 
— The mythical history of Thebes —
300

on the Kadmeia at Thebes; in the surviving tradition, however, the metamorphosis
is always associated with their exile. Another theory suggests that Kadmos may have
been identiﬁed with some Illyrian snake-hero. Whatever the original signiﬁcance of
the transformation, it came to be explained either as a punishment or as a deliver-
ance from sorrow. Hyginus reports, for instance, that the pair were transformed at
the will of Ares because he was still angry at the loss of his Theban dragon.51 In
the fullest surviving narrative, Ovid sets the stage for the transformation by telling
how the couple once came to reﬂect on their many misfortunes during their discon-
solate old age in Illyria. Both are described as being bowed down by age even though
Harmonia was a goddess. Kadmos suggests Ares may have visited them with their
sufferings to avenge his killing of the sacred serpent at Thebes, and prays that he
himself may become a serpent if that is indeed the case. Even while he is speaking,
his body begins to lengthen, and his skin to harden and darken and to grow a
covering of scales; and as his familiar form and features disappear, Harmonia prays
to share his fate. They are now a pair of harmless reptiles that neither fear nor injure
human beings because they remember what they once were.52
Dionysos informs Kadmos of his future fate in Euripides’ Bacchae, foretelling that he and
his wife will be transformed into snakes (apparently as part of the punishment that the god
inﬂicts on the family to avenge Pentheus’ rejection of his rites). Although there is no direct
reference to the couple’s Illyrian exile – perhaps because there is a gap in the relevant section
of the play – Dionysos goes on to say that they will drive into Greece in an ox-cart at the
head of an army of foreigners, and will sack many cities until the invaders meet with disaster
on attacking the oracle of Loxias (i.e. of Apollo at Delphi); but they themselves will be saved
by Ares, who will transfer them to eternal life among the blessed. As we know from
Herodotus, there was a tradition that some Encheleans and Illyrians had once met with
destruction when they had attacked Apollo’s temple at Delphi, but it seems that the orig-
inal story had nothing to do with Kadmos; the present version was probably invented by
Euripides himself. Quite the oddest feature in this account is the suggestion that the couple
will already be in snake-form while leading the barbarian army, a notion that might be hard
to credit if it were not clearly indicated in Kadmos’ response that this is exactly what
Dionysos had meant.53
The early Labdakids, and the Theban careers of Lykos 
and Nykteus
POLYDOROS, son of Kadmos, who succeeded to the throne after the brief and unfor-
tunate reign of Pentheus, is hardly more than a name; for as was noted above, he was
of genealogical signiﬁcance alone as the link who served to tie the Theban dynasty of
the Labdakids to the founder Kadmos. According to the uniﬁed genealogical scheme
that was developed through this linkage, Polydoros was the father of Labdakos, 
the eponymous founder of the dynasty, which includes Oedipus and his warring sons
Polyneikes and Eteokles among its members. Polydoros is mentioned as the son of
Kadmos in the Theogony (though not in a part of the poem that can be ascribed 
to Hesiod himself), and then in Herodotus and tragedy.54
From what is reported by Apollodorus and Pausanias, the family history of
Polydoros and his immediate descendants can be reconstructed as follows. Polydoros

married Nykteis, daughter of Nykteus, and fathered a single child, LABDAKOS,
who was still an infant when his father fell fatally ill; so Labdakos entrusted his son
and throne to his brother-in-law Nykteus, inviting him to rule as regent. When
Labdakos assumed power in his own right, he became embroiled in a border-war
with his southern neighbour, Pandion, king of Athens, who defeated him with the
aid of a Thracian ally, Tereus (see p. 368); but he met an early death like his father
before him, and no further adventures are recorded for him. Apollodorus states ellip-
tically that he perished because he was of like mind to Pentheus, which would
suggest that he died prematurely because he tried to oppose Dionysos. His son
LAIOS was only a year old at the time of his death, and power in Thebes passed
to Lykos, the brother of Nykteus, who either ruled on Laios’ behalf as regent or
took advantage of the situation to seize power for himself. Lykos presided over the
city for many years until he was killed (or driven out) by his great-nephews Zethos
and Amphion, who established themselves as joint kings and forced Laios to depart
into exile. Laios took refuge at the court of Pelops in the western Peloponnese, where
he remained until he was ﬁnally able to secure his rightful throne after the death
of the usurpers; and with the story of the birth and exposure of his son Oedipus,
we enter on to familiar territory.55
As might be inferred from this summary, the major actors during this period of
the mythical history of Thebes were not the Labdakids themselves but the regents
and usurpers who ruled in their stead for so much of the time. So what was the
origin of Lykos and Nykteus, and how did they attain such authority in the city?
And why did Zethos and Amphion come to revolt against their great-uncle?
According to the usual tradition, LYKOS and NYKTEUS were born outside
Thebes as sons of a minor Boeotian ruler, Hyrieus, the eponymous founder of the
city of Hyria near the east coast of the province. Hyrieus himself was of Atlantid
birth, a son of Poseidon by Alkyone, daughter of Atlas (see p. 520). His sons would
have grown up at Hyria, but decided to seek their fortune at Thebes. Although
Apollodorus offered an account of their movements, his text is poorly preserved at
this point; it seems that they may have sought refuge at Thebes after killing
Phlegyas, the king of the rapacious Phlegyans of north-western Boeotia (see p. 560).
They arrived at Thebes during the reign of Pentheus in any case, and established
close relations with the royal family. As a result of their friendship with the king,
they were readily accepted as honoured citizens, and Lykos was eventually elected
to a position of considerable power as the polemarch (military commander) of the
city. Nykteus had two daughters, Nykteis, who married Polydoros as we have seen,
and Antiope, who bore Zethos and Amphion to Zeus. Lykos married a woman called
Dirke, whom we will meet below as the cruel stepmother of Antiope, but he is not
reported to have fathered any children by her.56
Apollodorus refers to an alternative genealogy that represented Lykos and Nykteus as sons of
Chthonios, one of the Spartoi (Sown Men); this was presumably a relatively late genealogy
that was devised at Thebes itself to provide the interlopers with a proper Theban ancestry.
The alteration makes no difference otherwise since Antiope and her children could be regarded
as descendants of Nykteus as before. In the earliest tradition, however, Antiope was a daughter
of the river-god Asopos and had no connection with Nykteus or Lykos by birth or otherwise.57
— The mythical history of Thebes —
302

The Asopos in question was properly the small Boeotian river of that name rather than the
Peloponnesian river; see also on p. 537. If this genealogy is accepted, Antiope’s family history
cannot follow the course that will be described below. Thus in the Odyssey, which classes her
as an Asopid, her sons are presented as the original founders of Thebes (see p. 306) rather than
as interlopers who seized power as a result of conﬂicts within their own family. We cannot
tell for sure when Antiope ﬁrst came to be described as a daughter of Nykteus of Atlantid
descent; although such a descent is not explicitly attested for her by any author earlier than
Euripides, it seems more likely than not that the Hesiodic Catalogue classed her as an Atlantid
rather than an Asopid.58 She was not always classed as an Asopid in archaic literature in any
case since the Cypria, an early epic in the Trojan cycle, is known to have referred to her as a
daughter of Lykourgos.59
Antiope, daughter of Nykteus, and her twin sons Zethos 
and Amphion
While Nykteus was ruling at Thebes, presumably during the childhood of Labdakos,
Zeus seduced or raped his daughter ANTIOPE, causing her to become pregnant
with twin sons. To escape her father’s anger and threats of punishment, Antiope
ﬂed to Sicyon on the far side of the Isthmus of Corinth where she received a kind
reception from the ruler, Epopeus, who asked her to become his wife. Or in a slightly
different account, he ran across her at her hiding-place and took her to Sicyon to
become his wife. Nykteus was so upset by this course of events that he soon died
or committed suicide; but before his life came to an end, he charged his brother
Lykos on oath to take action against Epopeus and Antiope. So Lykos marched against
Sicyon, defeated and killed Epopeus, and brought Antiope back to Thebes as a
captive. In the course of the journey, when they reached Eleutherai in southern
Boeotia, Antiope gave birth to Zethos and Amphion, her twin sons by Zeus, and
exposed them on Mt Kithairon. This version of the story was ultimately derived
from the lost Antiope of Euripides; in that play, Zeus was said to have approached
the unfortunate Antiope in the form of a Satyr.60
Pausanias records a different version of these events derived from the Sicyonian
tradition. While Nykteus was acting as regent for Labdakos, Epopeus abducted
Antiope from Thebes (perhaps after being rejected when he had asked to marry her),
provoking her father to march against Sicyon. Epopeus gained the upper hand even
though he was wounded in battle, inﬂicting a fatal injury on Nykteus and forcing
the Thebans to withdraw. As Nykteus was lying on his deathbed after being carried
back to Thebes, he transferred the regency to his brother and asked him to launch
an even larger expedition against Sicyon to exact vengeance on Epopeus; and for
less obvious reasons, he also asked him to punish Antiope if he could catch her
(perhaps because she had colluded in her own abduction). As events turned out,
Lykos had no occasion to resort to force, since Epopeus had died in the mean time
and his successor was willing to surrender Antiope. She gave birth to her sons at
Eleutherai during the return journey as above; it would seem that she had been
seduced and rendered pregnant by Zeus before the time of her abduction.61
After being recovered from Sicyon, in whatever circumstances, Antiope was held
in close conﬁnement by Lykos and his wife DIRKE, and was cruelly mistreated by
them for many long years. As for her twin children, ZETHOS and AMPHION,

they had been rescued by a herdsman and were being reared by him in his cottage
on the slopes of Mt Kithairon. When they were grown up, Antiope ﬁnally escaped
from her imprisonment, either through the opportunity of the moment or because
her fetters miraculously broke apart of their own accord; but although she managed
to ﬁnd her way to the cottage where her sons were living, Zethos mistook her for
a runaway slave and turned her away. As chance would have it, Dirke happened to
pass by while roaming the hills as a Bacchant and caught sight of Antiope; but
although she dragged her away with the intention of killing her, Zethos and
Amphion had set off in search of her after learning from their foster-father that she
was their mother, and they managed to track her down before Dirke could cause
her any serious harm. To avenge Dirke’s ill-treatment of their mother, they tied her
to a bull by her long hair, causing her to be trampled to death by it; and they then
travelled to Thebes to exact vengeance on Lykos too by putting him to death or at
least driving him out of the city. Or in another version of the legend, they enticed
him out of the city by promising to deliver Antiope to him, intending to put him
to death on his arrival; but Hermes restrained them and ordered Lykos to depart
into exile. After seizing power in this way by killing or exiling the current ruler
of Thebes, Zethos and Amphion consolidated their position by banishing Laios, the
legitimate heir in the Kadmeian line.62
In addition to a more orthodox account, Hyginus records an odd version of Antiope’s story in
which she was initially married to her uncle Lykos. He cast her aside, however, after she was
raped by Epopeus (in unspeciﬁed circumstances), and married Dirke instead. During her new
life on her own, Antiope was seduced by Zeus. Presumably after observing the resulting preg-
nancy, Dirke came to suspect that she had been sleeping with her husband in secret, and
ordered her servants to keep her chained up in the dark; but Zeus contrived that she should
escape from her chains when her pregnancy reached full term, and she ﬂed to Mt Kithairon,
where she gave birth to her twin sons by a crossroads. They survived to take revenge on Dirke
as in the usual tradition.63 In his two accounts of the story, Hyginus talks as though the ruler
of Sicyon were called Epaphos rather than Epopeus, but this is plainly an error.
A fragment by Asios, a Spartan epic poet of the archaic period, states that Antiope gave
birth to Zethos and Amphion after conceiving them to Zeus and Epopeus. It would seem
that the poet considered one child to have been divinely fathered while the other was of
purely human birth, as was often believed of the Dioskouroi (or it is conceivable that the
poet was merely indicating that Epopeus was their putative father).64
The name Dirke was attached to a well-known spring at Thebes and also to a stream that
issued from it; a chorus in Euripides’ Bacchae addresses Dirke, the nymph of these waters,
in most ﬂattering terms as a revered daughter of Acheloos.65 It was surely not a Theban
who took the step of applying this honoured name to the evil stepmother of Antiope’s
legend. Once it was accepted that the sons of Antiope had killed a mortal woman of this
name, she came to be regarded as the eponym of the stream; and it came to be suggested
accordingly that her body was thrown into the stream after her death, or that her ashes were
scattered into it, or indeed that her blood or body was transformed into its waters.66
Pausanias offers a brief account of the subsequent life of Antiope. Since Dirke had
honoured Dionysos above all other gods, he was greatly angered by her death 
and drove Antiope mad, causing her to wander through Greece in a state of frenzy.
She was eventually rescued from this fate, however, by Phokos, son of Ornytion,
— The mythical history of Thebes —
304

who cured her of her madness (presumably by means of puriﬁcatory rites), married
her and settled down with her at Tithorea in northern Phokis (some ten miles north-
east of Delphi). Along with Phokos, son of Aiakos, this present Phokos, who was
a grandson of Sisyphos from Corinth, was one of the two eponyms of the province
of Phocis; see further on p. 565. The joint grave of Phokos and Antiope could be
seen at Tithorea in historical times. Each year, when the sun was in the constella-
tion of the Bull (Taurus), the Tithoreans would attempt to steal some earth from
the burial-mound of Zethos and Amphion at Thebes to place it on that of Antiope;
for a prophecy had revealed that their crops would thrive if they could do so, while
those of the Thebans would fail.67
The reign of Zethos and Amphion, and the massacre 
of the Niobids
After establishing themselves as the joint rulers of Thebes, Zethos and Amphion
fortiﬁed the city by erecting magniﬁcent walls with seven gates; and in some
accounts, they also constructed the lower city on the land beneath the citadel or
Kadmeia, which had been settled by Kadmos.68 These celebrated walls, which ﬁgure
so prominently in the legend of the Seven against Thebes, may be regarded as prod-
ucts of the mythical imagination, for it is most unlikely that any Mycenaean
fortiﬁcation would have had as many as seven gates; such an extravagant provision
would merely weaken the defences, and there is nothing in the topography of the
site to indicate any reason for it. Each of the brothers contributed as best he could
to the building-work, Zethos relying on his practical skills and brute strength while
Amphion exploited his skills as a musician by singing so enchantingly to his lyre
that the stones followed him to their proper positions of their own accord. The
musical powers of Amphion are described in similar terms to those of Orpheus (see
p. 551). This was probably a fairly ancient feature of his legend (even if Homer
makes no mention of it when referring to Zethos and Amphion) since the Europeia,
an early epic ascribed to the Corinthian poet Eumelos, stated that Hermes taught
Amphion to play the lyre before any other mortal, and that animals and stones
would follow after him when he sang to it. The Hesiodic Catalogue apparently
mentioned that he made use of this power during the building of the walls, as is
stated unequivocally in a fragment from Euripides. Most subsequent authors agree
that he acquired his lyre from Hermes (although Pherecydes stated that it was
presented to him by the Muses, and some later sources suggest that it was given
to him by Apollo or Zeus); some explained that he earned this privilege by raising
the ﬁrst altar to the gods.69 Zethos was traditionally presented as being of opposite
character to his brother, as a bluff and practical man who devoted himself to cattle-
breeding and virile pursuits. Euripides developed the contrast in a lost play of his,
the Antiope, by portraying the brothers as proponents of two opposing ways of life,
the practical and the contemplative, and by having them debate the value of each
in a more or less philosophical manner.70
According to the standard tradition in classical and later times, as followed in the preced-
ing narrative, Kadmos founded Thebes in the ﬁrst place by building the upper city on the

acropolis, while Zethos and Amphion became its second founders by fortifying (and perhaps
constructing) the lower city while the legitimate Kadmeian heir was temporarily excluded. 
A pattern of this kind might seem to suggest that there were two separate foundation myths
that needed to be reconciled; and it is in fact the case that there are accounts from the early
tradition in which Zethos and Amphion are presented as the original founders. Odysseus 
states in the Odyssey that Antiope told him in the Underworld that ‘she had slept in the arms
of Zeus himself, and had given birth to two sons, Zethos and Amphion, who ﬁrst founded the
seat of seven-gated Thebes and fortiﬁed it with walls, for they could not live in spacious
Thebes without the defence of walls, mighty though they were’. The early mythographer
Pherecydes expands on the latter point by saying that the brothers built the walls to pro-
tect themselves against some speciﬁc enemies, the Phlegyans (a mythical people of Central 
Greece who were notorious for their violence and rapacity, see p. 560); the city was conquered
nonetheless after their death by Eurymachos, king of the Phlegyans, who laid waste to it,
leaving it deserted until Kadmos arrived at a later period and refounded it. It will be noted
that this account reconciles the two foundation myths, but by adopting the opposite strategy
to that generally adopted in the later tradition, by making Kadmos the second founder.71
The Odyssey classes Antiope as a daughter of Asopos rather than of Lykos (as would probably
have been the case with Pherecydes also); on this genealogical point and its implications, see
further on pp. 302–3.
Amphion married NIOBE, the daughter of Tantalos from Asia Minor, who bore him
numerous sons and daughters, from seven to ten of each in most accounts. As has
already been mentioned (see p. 307), Niobe was so proud of her large family that she
boasted that she had many more children than the goddess Leto, who had two alone,
Artemis and Apollo. Leto was so offended that she called on her children to exact
vengeance, and they proceeded to kill all the Niobids, Artemis shooting the female
children and Apollo the males. In her grief at their death, Niobe left her husband 
and returned to her original homeland in Lydia, where she was turned to stone (see
pp. 307 and 502).72 Amphion was also said to have met his death as a consequence
of these events, either because he was killed in the course of the massacre, or because
he stabbed himself in his sorrow, or because he was shot by Apollo while he was
trying to storm the god’s temple (evidently in anger at the fate of his children).73
According to one tradition, Zethos married Thebe, a daughter of the river-god
Asopos (see p. 536) and the eponym of Thebes;74 or in another account of more
ancient origin, he was married to AEDON (Nightingale), daughter of Pandareos.
Pherecydes tells how Aedon grew jealous of Amphion for having so many children
while she had only two, Itylos and Nais, and accidentally killed her son Itylos 
one night while trying to kill Alalkomeneus, a son of Amphion. When Zeus sent
Poine (Vengeance personiﬁed) against her, she prayed to be transformed into a bird,
and Zeus turned her into a nightingale. This story is cited in explanation of a passage
in the Odyssey that remarks that the daughter of Pandareos, the nightingale of the
greenwood (chlo¯reis ae¯do¯n), sings sweetly in the springtime as she laments for her
child Itylos, son of Zethos, whom she had killed accidentally with a sword. The
origin of the nightingale and its sorrowful song was commonly explained in the
subsequent tradition by the Attic legend of Tereus and Prokne (see p. 368). Pausanias
reports that Zethos died of grief after hearing that his son had been murdered by
his wife.75
— The mythical history of Thebes —
306

Two of the children of Niobe and Amphion, a son Amyklas and daughter Meliboia, were
sometimes said to have survived the massacre. This tradition is ﬁrst reported by Telesilla,
an Argive poetess of the ﬁfth century BC; according to Pausanias, they were spared because
they prayed to Leto for mercy, and they settled in Argos afterwards, founding the city’s
sanctuary of Leto in gratitude for their escape. Meliboia had been so frightened that she had
turned pale (chlo¯ris) from fear, and she remained so ever afterwards and therefore came to
be known as CHLORIS; a statue of her could be seen beside that of Leto in the goddess’
sanctuary in Argos.76 Under her new name of Chloris, she won the foot-race at the ﬁrst
Heraian Games (the women’s games at Olympia) after they were founded by Hippodameia
as a thank-offering for her marriage to Pelops.77 This Chloris should not be confused (as she
occasionally was in antiquity) with the Chloris, daughter of Amphion, who married Neleus
at Pylos; as the Odyssey and a fragment from the Hesiodic Catalogue make clear, the wife of
Neleus was fathered by a different Amphion, a son of Iasos or Iasios who ruled at Orchomenos
rather than at Thebes.78
Laios recovers his rightful throne, and exposes his son Oedipus
After the death of Zethos and Amphion, the legitimate ruler, LAIOS, son of
Labdakos, was able to return to Thebes to reclaim his inheritance. He had been 
living in Elis in the north-western Peloponnese in the mean time, as a guest of Pelops,
king of Pisa. A single story is recorded in connection with his exile. While teaching 
the art of chariot-driving to CHRYSIPPOS, a young illegitimate son of Pelops, he
conceived a passion for him and carried him off with the intention of seducing 
him; but Chrysippos repulsed him and killed himself with his sword out of shame.79
Some explained the subsequent misfortunes of the Labdakids by saying that Pelops
cursed the entire family on hearing of the fate of Chrysippos; and in one account at
least, the Sphinx was said to have been sent against Thebes by the marriage-goddess
Hera to punish the Thebans for failing to take action against Laios.80 This tale of the
abduction of Chrysippos was recounted in some form in the lost Chrysippos of
Euripides; but there was also a conﬂicting tale which was at least as old, and prob-
ably more so, in which Chrysippos was said to have been murdered by two of his 
half-brothers (see p. 505). Some authors tried to reconcile the two traditions by
suggesting that Pelops recovered his lost son by force and brought him back to Pisa,
where he was subsequently murdered by members of his own family.81
Laios married IOKASTE (Jocasta in Latinized form), who belonged to a side-
branch of the Theban royal family as a daughter of Menoikeus and sister of Kreon.
She was destined to become both the mother and the wife of Oedipus. The Odyssey
diverges from the usual tradition, however, by naming Oedipus’ mother as
Epikaste.82 When Iokaste initially failed to produce any children, Laios consulted the
Delphic oracle, which warned him to abandon any thought of fathering a child since
he would be killed by his son if he should have one. Although he kept out of his
wife’s bed for a time, he had intercourse with her one night while he was ﬂushed with
wine, causing her to conceive the fateful son. Soon after the child was born, Laios
handed him over to a shepherd to be exposed, ﬁrst thrusting a spike through his feet
to ensure that he would not be recovered and reared, hence his name of OEDIPUS
(properly OIDIPOUS in Greek) or ‘Swell-foot’. In the most familiar account of these
events, the shepherd (sometimes named as Euphorbos or Phorbos) was told to place

him out to die on Mt Kithairon on the southern borders of Boeotia. Kithairon was
also used as summer pasture by the Corinthians, and the shepherd felt such pity for
the child that he handed him over to one of his Corinthian colleagues, who took him
away to his master Polybos, the king of Corinth. Since Polybos and his wife Merope
(or Periboia, or Medousa) had no children of their own, they decided to raise Oedipus
as their own son. Or in a slightly different version, Oedipus was exposed on the
mountain as Laios had ordered, but was discovered and rescued by some Corinthians,
who took him to their king.83 According to a less favoured tradition, Laios sent the
child out to sea in a chest, but he was washed ashore safely at Corinth, or else at
Sicyon, the next main city to the west. Oedipus was then reared in the royal house-
hold as usual; according to Hyginus, who does not specify the location, the queen,
Periboia, discovered the child while she was washing clothes by the shore.84
There were also versions in which Oedipus was conveyed to Sicyon by a herdsman or shep-
herd after being exposed on Kithairon.85 The king who reared him is named as Polybos
whether he ruled at Corinth or Sicyon. The Sicyonian Polybos is described as a son of Hermes
by Chthonophyle, daughter of Sikyon,86 and is also known in another connection as the king
of Sikyon who offered a home to Adrastos, king of Argos, during the period of his exile (see
p. 332). It seems likely that the foster-father of Oedipus was this Sicyonian in the original
tradition, and that the Corinthian version is secondary; for no genealogy is offered for the
Corinthian Polybos, nor can any proper place be found for him in the early Corinthian royal
line (which was descended from Sisyphos, see pp. 430ff). The name of Oedipus’ foster-mother
is more variable; Sophocles calls her Merope, Apollodorus and Hyginus call her Periboia,
and other sources Medousa or Antiochis.87 Although Polybos is fully aware that the child
is a foundling in Sophocles’ account, the queen sometimes passes him off as a child of her
own marriage without her husband being aware of his true origin.88
Oedipus kills his father and wins the Theban throne by solving
the riddle of the Sphinx
When Oedipus came of age, he set off for Delphi to enquire about his origins.
According to Sophocles in Oedipus the King, he became concerned about the matter
after he was taunted at a banquet by a drunken guest who accused him of not being
a true son of Polybos. Although the king and queen tried to reassure him, the
rumours persisted and the matter continued to trouble him until he decided to
consult the Delphic oracle without the knowledge of his putative parents. The god
at Delphi offered no response to him on the point in question, but revealed instead
that he was destined to kill his father, and then to marry his own mother and father
children by her. Assuming that the oracle was referring to Polybos and Merope, he
resolved to stay away from his former home forever, and set off in the direction of
Thebes. As he was approaching a point on his route where three roads ran together,
he happened to meet an old man who was travelling by cart in the opposite direc-
tion accompanied by ﬁve attendants. When the herald who was proceeding at the
head of the party tried to force him off the road, Oedipus struck back at him and
continued on his way; but as he was passing the cart, the old man hit him on the
head with his ox-goad. Not realizing that the stranger was his own father, Oedipus
reacted by dealing him a fatal blow with his staff, and then set out to kill the other
— The mythical history of Thebes —
308

members of the group (although one of them escaped undetected). Without discov-
ering anything further about his victims, he then resumed his journey and travelled
on to Thebes.89
In the rather different account in Euripides’ Phoenician Women, Oedipus encoun-
tered Laios at a point where their paths ran together as both of them were heading
for Delphi, Oedipus to enquire about his parentage and Laios to ask whether his
exposed son was truly dead. Laios’ charioteer ordered Oedipus to stand out of the
way of the king, but the proud youth ignored him and killed the old man when
his feet were trampled by the advancing chariot-horses. He then seized the chariot
and drove it back to Corinth to present it to Polybos, apparently without ever
reaching Delphi.90 This version in which both parties were travelling in the same
direction may well have been the earlier form of the story, for it would explain why
the confrontation took place at a place where roads ran together. The incident was
supposed to have occurred at a site in Phocis called the Cleft Way (schiste¯ hodos),
where the road from Lebadeia (and thence from Thebes) was joined by a more
northerly road from Daulis before ascending through a mountain-valley to Delphi.91
Since Laios had no children apart from the son whom he had exposed, the throne
passed to the senior member of another branch of the royal family, KREON, son
of Menoikeus. The Thebans began to be troubled soon afterwards by a fearsome
monster, the SPHINX (Throttler), a winged creature with the body of a lion and
the head of a woman, of a type familiar enough in Near Eastern art. Hesiod classes
her as a child of Orthos and Chimaira (see p. 63), and refers to her as ‘the deadly
Phix that brought destruction to the Kadmeians’; in view of Hesiod’s Boeotian
origin and later reports that remark that the monster sat on Mt Phikion outside
Thebes, it would appear that Phix was a local Boeotian form of her name. According
to her usual legend, she would set a riddle for passers-by and would kill them if
they were unable to solve it, but was fated to meet her own death if anyone should
provide the correct solution. There is reason to suppose, however, that she may
simply have carried away young Thebans without posing any question in the earliest
tradition. Sophocles is the ﬁrst author to state unequivocally that she posed a riddle
(although this already seems to be indicated in a brief fragment from Pindar).92
Since it is characteristic of local monsters of this kind to appear on the scene without
need for explanation, it is hardly surprising that there was no settled tradition on
why the Sphinx should have arrived to plague Thebes. Some mythographers, as we
have seen, connected her arrival with Laios’ abduction of Chrysippos (see p. 307);
in that case she was sent by Hera, but there was also an account in which she was
sent by Dionysos for some unstated reason (perhaps because Pentheus had opposed
his rites).93
When the Sphinx proceeded to kill one Theban after another, including the king’s
son Haimon in some accounts,94 Kreon ﬁnally grew so desperate that he offered the
kingdom and the hand of the former queen, Iokaste, to anyone who could rid the city
of this terror. Either in the hope of winning this reward, or by chance while he 
was seeking a new home in exile, Oedipus now arrived at Thebes and provided the
correct answer to the riddle of the Sphinx. This riddle, which has been recorded in
comparable forms in many parts of the world, asked what single being is four-footed,

two-footed and three-footed. In its traditional form, as recorded in some hexameter
verses which probably originated in Attic tragedy (or possibly early epic), it ran as
follows:
There is a being on earth that is four-footed, two-footed and three-footed, yet
has a single voice; and of all beings that move on the ground or through the
air or sea, it alone changes its form; and when it moves with the support of
the most feet, then is the speed of its limbs at the weakest.95

Oedipus inferred that the riddle refers to man, who crawls on all fours as an infant,
walks upright on two legs when grown up, and employs a stick as a third foot in
old age. When her secret was revealed to all and sundry by the newcomer, the
Sphinx took her own life by hurling herself from the Theban acropolis or from a
cliff outside the city, or else surrendered herself to Oedipus to be killed.96
The unholy marriage of Oedipus and his downfall
In the account familiar from tragedy and the later tradition, Oedipus claimed
IOKASTE, the wife of the late king, along with the kingdom as his reward for
ridding Thebes of the Sphinx, and lived with her for a long period, fathering two
daughters by her, Antigone and Ismene, and two quarrelsome sons, Polyneikes and
Eteokles; but when the truth about his birth and his father’s death ﬁnally came to
be revealed, Iokaste hanged herself, and Oedipus blinded himself and then abid-
cated the throne to depart into exile.97 Early epic accounts seem to have followed
a different pattern, however, in which Oedipus continued to rule at Thebes after
the revelations (here made quite soon after his accession) and subsequently married
a second wife who became the mother of his children. Odysseus refers to his contin-
uing rule in the Odyssey when describing how he saw the dead mother of Oedipus
in Hades:
I saw the mother of Oidipodes, the beautiful Epikaste, who did a dreadful
deed in the ignorance of her mind by marrying her own son, who wedded her
after killing his father; but the gods soon made these things known to men.
But he, through the cruel counsels of the gods, reigned on over the Kadmeians
in lovely Thebes suffering woes, while she went down to the house of Hades,
the mighty keeper of the gates, fastening the deadly noose to the roof of the
lofty hall in the stress of her grief; but to him she left behind many sorrows,
all that a mother’s Erinyes (Furies) can bring to pass.98
The Iliad reports, furthermore, that funeral games were held for Oedipus at Thebes
after he had fallen (apparently in battle),99 which would indicate that he was an
honoured ruler at the time of his death. Since Oedipus continued to rule at Thebes,
the sorrows that are ascribed to him in the Odyssey could hardly be related to any
blinding or exile as in the later tradition; one should perhaps suppose that the poet
was referring above all to the hostility that arose between Oedipus and his sons,
which is known to have been a central feature of his story in early epic (see below).
He would doubtless have been troubled by regret and conscience too. By saying
that the gods soon (aphar) made his transgression known,100 Homer certainly seems
to indicate that this must have happened fairly swiftly before Oedipus would have
had time to father several children by the incestuous marriage. In the Oedipodeia,
the relevant epic in the Theban cycle, Oedipus took a second wife after the revela-
tions, marrying Euryganeia, daughter of Hyperphas, who bore him the four children
who are borne to him by Iokaste in tragic and later sources; this may well have
been the accepted tradition in early epic.101
Aeschylus’ Seven against Thebes is the earliest surviving source for the story that
Oedipus fathered his four children by his own mother, and that he blinded himself

after discovering that he had killed his father and married his mother.102 This was
the third play in a trilogy ﬁrst produced in 467 BC, of which the preceding Laios
and Oedipus (which would have given a full account of the hero’s career) are now
lost; it is not known whether Oedipus went into exile in Aeschylus’ version (most
likely not). The dominant account of the fall of Oedipus was established once and
for all in a tragedy that was composed half a century or more later, Sophocles’ Oedipus
the King, which related the story as follows.
After Oedipus had reigned at Thebes as a highly respected sovereign for many
years, the city was struck by a terrible plague, and he dispatched Kreon to Delphi
to enquire about a cure; and when the oracle declared that the epidemic would be
brought to an end if the murderer of Laios were killed or at least expelled, the 
king set to work to discover who this might be. He publicly cursed the guilty man,
and proclaimed that anyone who could help to identify him should step forward,
and ordered furthermore that no one should offer him shelter or have anything to
do with him, whoever he might be.103 When he then interrogated Teiresias, the
seer tried to keep silent initially, but indicated under pressure that Oedipus himself
was the man who was polluting the land, and that he was therefore searching for
himself. At this point, however, his words made no impression on Oedipus, who
simply accused him of having accepted bribes from Kreon to jeopardize his posi-
tion.104 On hearing of this, Kreon came to the palace to protest, and became
embroiled in a bitter argument with the king; but Iokaste persuaded them to sepa-
rate after overhearing their raised voices, and questioned Oedipus about the cause
of the quarrel after Kreon had left. When she was told that Teiresias had accused
her husband of having committed the murder, she tried to reassure him by arguing
that prophecies are not to be trusted, at least to judge by the oracle that had been
delivered to Laios about his son (whom she naturally supposed to be dead), and by
asserting furthermore that Oedipus could hardly have been responsible for the death
of Laios, since he had been killed abroad by brigands at a place where three roads
ran together. Far from being reassured, however, Oedipus was alarmed by what she
said about the crossroads, for he himself had once killed an aged man at a cross-
roads. Beginning to suspect for the ﬁrst time that there might be something in the
seer’s words, he questioned Iokaste further, only to ﬁnd that his fears were conﬁrmed.
On learning that she had been informed of the details of the incident by an atten-
dant of Laios who had escaped and was now living in the countryside outside the
city, Oedipus ordered that he should be fetched.105
While this was being arranged, a messenger arrived from Corinth to report that
the citizens had invited Oedipus to rule over them as the successor of his putative
father, Polybos, who had died of sickness and old age during his absence. If Polybos
had really been his father, this meant that Oedipus could not have been guilty of
the death of his father, and he initially found some relief in that thought; but it so
happened that the messenger was the shepherd who had ﬁrst brought him to Polybos
as a baby after receiving him from the Theban shepherd who had been sent to expose
him; and when this was revealed by the Corinthian, Iokaste realized who her husband
must be, and went off into the palace on her own to kill herself.106 It happened
that the attendant of Laios who had been summoned by the king was the very person
who had taken him out for exposure, and when he conﬁrmed the truth of the
— The mythical history of Thebes —
312

Corinthian’s words on his arrival, Oedipus was at last compelled to recognize the
truth about his origins and about his subsequent life. He rushed into the palace to
discover that Iokaste had hanged herself; and tearing the brooches from her clothing,
one in each hand, he gouged out his eyes with the brooch-pins.107
There were inevitably tragic and later accounts that differed from that of Sophocles. In
Euripides’ Phoenician Women, for instance, Iokaste is still alive at the time of the ﬁrst Theban
War, and ﬁnally kills herself after her two sons have killed themselves in the course of that
conﬂict.108 Although little has survived of the same author’s Oedipus, it is reported that
Oedipus was blinded by the servants of Laios in that play, apparently after it was discov-
ered that he had killed Laios but before it became known that he was the son of the former
king (for he is referred to the son of Polybos in a fragment preserved in this connection).109
Hyginus records a version in which Oedipus’ foster-mother Periboia came to Thebes after
the death of he husband and revealed that Oedipus had been no more than an adoptive son;
and when the man who had exposed him then recognized from the scars on his feet and
ankles that he was the son of Laios, he blinded himself with the brooches from his mother’s
dress as in Sophocles’ account, and departed into exile with his daughter Antigone.110
A rather different account of Oedipus’ downfall which may perhaps be of early origin is
recorded in the scholia to Euripides’ Phoenician Women; it is ascribed to Peisandros, here
apparently the Hellenistic mythographer of that name rather than the epic poet. After killing
Laios and his attendants at the Cleft Way as in the usual story, Oedipus buried them at
once in their clothing, removing Laios’ sword and belt (zo¯ste¯r, warrior’s belt) to keep them
for his own use. When Iokaste had become his wife, he happened to pass through the same
area with her after performing some sacriﬁces on Mt Kithairon, and he told her of every-
thing that had happened there, pointing to the relevant spot and showing her the belt.
Although Iokaste realized from what he said that he must have been the man who had killed
her former husband, she kept quiet for the moment in spite of her distress, for she was not
yet aware of the worst of the matter, that her husband was also her son. This was revealed
at a later time when an aged horse-breeder arrived at Thebes to seek a reward for having
rescued the young Oedipus many years before; he explained that he had discovered the
exposed child and had brought him to Merope, queen of Sicyon, producing his swaddling-
clothes as proof together with the pins that had been driven through his ankles. Iokaste
killed herself after hearing this, and Oedipus blinded himself; but he subsequently took a
new wife, Euryganeia, who bore him his four children.111 Since the revelation occurred before
Iokaste had had time to bear any children to Oedipus, who fathered his children by his
second marriage, and since the narrative itself moreover seems ill-suited to a tragedy, some
have argued that this account may have originated in early epic.
The death of Oedipus and his ﬁnal resting-place
There were three traditions about the ﬁnal resting-place of Oedipus. In early epic
accounts in which he remained at Thebes after his origins were revealed, he appar-
ently received a splendid funeral at Thebes, as is indicated in the Iliad and was
doubtless also the case in the Hesiodic Catalogue;112 while in Sophocles’ Oedipus at
Kolonos and the standard later tradition, he died in exile and was buried at Kolonos
just outside Athens, where a heroic shrine was erected to him in historical times;
and there was also a further tradition that claimed that he was buried at the Boeotian
town of Eteonos. The familiar story that he met his death at Kolonos after long

wanderings with his daughter Antigone ﬁrst appears in the last decade of the ﬁfth
century in Sophocles’ Oedipus at Kolonos (or perhaps slightly earlier in Euripides’
Phoenician Women, if the relevant passage is not part of a later addition). But it seems
likely that Sophocles was appealing to an existing tradition (even if it was not a
particularly old one) when he placed Oedipus’ death at Kolonos, especially since the
story had some basis in cult; thus in 411 BC, when the Athenians defeated 
some Thebans in a cavalry engagement near Kolonos, they believed that they had
beneﬁted from the protection of the deiﬁed Oedipus.113
The plot of Sophocles’ Oedipus at Kolonos turns on three oracles. Oedipus has received an
oracle telling him that he will at last come to rest when he ﬁnds shelter in a sanctuary of
the Semnai (Awful Goddesses, i.e. Erinyes, Furies); Kreon, who is now ruling at Thebes after
having expelled Oedipus, has learned from the Delphic oracle that Oedipus must be buried
at Thebes if the city is to be secure, while Athens will prevail over Thebes if he is buried
in Attica; and third, Oedipus’ son Polyneikes has been told that he will prevail in his conﬂict
with his brother Eteokles if he has his father’s support. The play begins as Oedipus arrives
at Kolonos with his daughter Antigone and sits down on a rock in the sanctuary of the
Eumenides (Kindly Ones, i.e. Erinyes). Although he is warned by a local man that this is
forbidden ground, he recognizes that he has found the place foretold in the oracle and is
determined not to move.114 His other daughter, Ismene, arrives soon afterwards to tell him
that Eteokles has driven Polyneikes into exile, and that Kreon will be coming to fetch
Oedipus back to Thebes for the reasons indicated in the above-mentioned oracle.115 In
response to a summons from the elders of Kolonos, Theseus, the king of Athens, then appears
on the scene, and responds sympathetically to Oedipus’ appeals, offering him sanctuary as
requested.116 Kreon appears next with a group of followers, and initially assumes a concil-
iatory tone in the hope of persuading Oedipus to return with him voluntarily; but he soon
resorts to force when Oedipus greets him with scorn, ﬁrst arresting the daughters of Oedipus
with the help of his guards and then approaching Oedipus himself. Theseus is alerted,
however, by the loud protests of the elders of Kolonos (who form the chorus) and comes to
the rescue of his guests.117 Oedipus’ ﬁnal visitor is his son Polyneikes, who comes to ask
for his blessing before attacking Eteokles at Thebes; but Oedipus blames his sons for having
failed to save him from being exiled, and so curses Polyneikes instead, praying that his
attack may fail and that he and his brother may kill one another in the ﬁghting (as will
duly occur).118 On hearing three peals of thunder, Oedipus recognizes that the time has
come for him to die. He tells Theseus not to disclose the place of his death, and to transmit
the secret only within the royal line, saying that his tomb will protect Athens against the
Thebans if his instructions are followed. Now striding forth conﬁdently without need of a
guide, Oedipus sets off toward the appointed place accompanied by his daughters and
Theseus.119 A messenger reveals something of the mysterious events that followed, reporting
that Oedipus was summoned by a divine voice as he was saying farewell to his daughters,
and that he then withdrew to a place apart and vanished from human sight in some wondrous
manner that was known to Theseus alone.120
In a rather different account, perhaps also originating in tragedy, Oedipus came to the hill
of Hippios at Kolonos after being expelled from Thebes by Kreon, and sat down as a suppliant
in the temple of Demeter and Athena Poliouchos. Kreon tried to remove him by force, but
Theseus came to his aid; and when he was dying of old age, he asked Theseus to ensure that
no Theban should be shown the site of his grave.121 For what it is worth, Pausanias was told
at Kolonos that the bones of Theseus had been brought from Thebes; it is just possible that
this represents an earlier stage in the development of his Athenian legend.122
— The mythical history of Thebes —
314

In connection with the tradition that represented him as having been buried at Eteonos,
it was said that his friends had wanted to bury him at Thebes, but took him to an obscure
place called Keos in some other part of Boeotia when this was forbidden to them. Since the
local people blamed his presence for troubles that afﬂicted them thereafter, his friends subse-
quently removed his remains to Eteonos on the slopes of Mt Kithairon. They reburied him
there at dead of night without realizing that they were in the precinct of Demeter; and
when the people of Eteonos came to know of this, they sought the advice of the oracle of
Apollo, which instructed them not to move this suppliant of the goddess. The relevant tomb
could be recognized by an inscription.123
THE THEBAN WARS AND THEIR AFTERMATH
Polyneikes, son of Oedipus, quarrels with his brother 
Eteokles and departs to Argos
POLYNEIKES and ETEOKLES, the two sons of Oedipus, quarrelled over the succes-
sion after the exile or death of their father (or when he became too old to rule, or
when they were due to take over from Kreon who had been ruling as regent until
they came of age). The resulting conﬂict proved to be disastrous for both of them,
for they were destined to kill one another when Polyneikes tried to settle the matter
by marching against Thebes with foreign allies from Argos. The quarrel also brought
disaster to Thebes itself; for although it remained unconquered during this ﬁrst
Theban War, the sons of the defeated Argive leaders launched a second expedition
ten years later and captured the city, which never recovered its former strength 
and glory. The ﬁrst expedition was known as that of the Seven because its leader
appointed seven of the bravest participants to serve as champions, and the second
as that of the Epigonoi (i.e. the after-born or successors).
Although disputes could easily arise between rival heirs in the absence of any
strict rules of primogeniture, the fundamental cause of the quarrel between Eteokles
and Polyneikes was usually said to have been a curse that was uttered against them
by their father. In the Thebais, indeed, in the epic cycle, Oedipus cursed his sons
twice over, on the ﬁrst occasion because they had angered him by serving him at a
silver table that had belonged to Kadmos and by passing wine to him in a golden
cup of the same origin, even though he had expressly ordered them not to do so
(presumably because these heirlooms reminded him of the crime that he had
committed against his father). So he prayed that they should not divide their
patrimony in friendship, but that war and hatred should always be their lot; and
when they angered him once again by sending him a haunch of meat as his portion
at a sacriﬁce rather than the more honourable shoulder-piece (whether by negligence
or design), he cursed them yet more grievously by praying that they should die 
by one another’s hand.124 In tragedy and later sources, other explanations are offered
for his cursing of his sons. Thus in Sophocles’ Oedipus at Kolonos, as we have seen,
he cursed them to mutual destruction for not having lifted a hand to help him
when he had been expelled from Thebes by Kreon; or in other accounts, he cursed

— The mythical history of Thebes —
315

The stories that were put forward to explain how the feud between the brothers
initially developed fall into three main patterns. In an account ascribed to Hellanicus,
Eteokles allowed Polyneikes to choose whether he preferred to become the new king
of Thebes or to take what he wanted from the family treasures and settle elsewhere.
He chose to take the two divine heirlooms, the necklace and robe of Harmonia, 
but later broke the agreement by trying to seize the Theban throne in addition.126
In a comparable account by the early lyric poet Stesichorus, the mother of the two
princes tried to arrange a just settlement through a division of the inheritance,
proposing that one of them should depart with his father’s ﬂocks and gold while 
the other remained behind to rule at Thebes; so they cast lots, and when that of
Polyneikes came out ﬁrst, he departed with the possessions in accordance with the
terms of the draw.127 Here again we may suppose that Polyneikes was to blame for
the subsequent war; and since his name means ‘Much Strife’ while that of his brother
means ‘True Glory’, it is reasonable to assume that he was originally thought to have
been the guilty party. In the second main version of the story, as ascribed to
Pherecydes, Eteokles expelled his brother from Thebes by force, and Polyneikes there-
fore had some justiﬁcation in resorting to force on his own account.128 Or in a third
version, which ﬁrst appears in Euripides’ Phoenician Women, the two brothers agreed
to rule in alternate years, but Eteokles refused to surrender the throne to Polyneikes
after occupying it for the ﬁrst year, giving him ample reason to feel aggrieved. This
was the account that was generally favoured in the later tradition.129
Whatever the exact circumstances of his exile, Polyneikes travelled across the
Isthmus of Corinth to the city of Argos, where he married a daughter of the king
and gained support from him for an expedition against his native city. Euripides
provides the earliest surviving account of the events that led up to his marriage.
After reaching Argos at night, he sought shelter in the porch of the palace, but
soon quarrelled and came to blows with another man who arrived there with the
same intent, namely TYDEUS, son of Oineus, a violent Aetolian prince who had
been exiled from his homeland for murder (see p. 418). The noise was sufﬁcient to
awaken the king, ADRASTOS, son of Talaos, who hurried down to investigate. 
On observing the ferocious brawl, he was reminded of a mysterious oracle that he
had received from Apollo ordering him to marry his daughters to a lion and a boar;
since the two men resembled wild animals ﬁghting over a den, he welcomed them
into his palace in spite of the unfortunate circumstances of their meeting, and offered
his daughter ARGEIA to Polyneikes and his other daughter, Deipyle, to Tydeus.130
He promised to restore them to their native lands furthermore, beginning with
Polyneikes.131 Some later authors explained his interpretation of the oracle in other
ways, saying that he recognized the two men as the lion and boar because Polyneikes
had a lionskin on his shoulders and Tydeus a boar’s hide, or because they had images
of the foreparts of such animals on their shields (referring to the Sphinx and
Calydonian boar respectively).132
Pausanias records an account of Polyneikes’ exile and marriage that follows a quite different
pattern. Polyneikes departed into exile initially while Oedipus was still on the throne, in the
hope that this would enable him to escape his father’s curses, and he married Argeia at this
time; but Eteokles sent for him after the death of Oedipus and he came back to Thebes
— The mythical history of Thebes —
316

(presumably with his wife). The two brothers quarrelled, however, and Polyneikes went into
exile for a second time, and now asked his father-in-law to help him to seize power at
Thebes.133 This account may quite possibly have been derived from early epic. It is likely in
any case that Argeia was married to Polyneikes before the death of Oedipus in the Hesiodic
Catalogue, since she is reported to have attended the funeral of Oedipus,134 and it is hard to
imagine why she should have done so if she had not married into the family.
Adrastos appoints seven champions for an expedition 
against Thebes; Amphiaraos and Eriphyle
Adrastos lost no time in gathering together a sizeable army to attack Thebes. In
tragedy and the later tradition at least, he appointed seven champions to lead the
assault, one for each of the seven gates in the walls of the city. It is not known
whether these champions, who were known as the Seven against Thebes, already
ﬁgured in early epic; Pindar may have been following the epic tradition in stating
that the Argive dead were burned on seven funeral pyres,135 but this does not neces-
sarily imply that there were seven champions (especially if it is remembered that
two of the usual champions, Amphiaraos and Kapaneus, could not have been
cremated, for reasons that will become apparent presently).
Most sources agree on the names of at least six of the Seven.136 Three of the most
important of them belonged to Argive royal lines, namely Adrastos himself, who
was descended from Bias, Amphiaraos, son of Oikles, who was descended from
Melampous, and Kapaneus, son of Hipponoos, who belonged to the old Inachid
ruling line as a descendant of Proitos. To these we can add the two outsiders
Polyneikes and Tydeus, and also Parthenopaios, who was usually regarded as a
son of Atalanta from Arcadia (but sometimes as a son of Talaos and brother of
Adrastos). As for the remaining champion, he was variously named as Mekisteus,
son of Talaos, Eteoklos, son of Iphis, or Hippomedon, son of Aristomachos; but
these ﬁgures, all of them minor members of Argive royal lines, were so colourless
as to be practically interchangeable. If any of the usual champions were omitted for
some reason, more than one of these lesser ﬁgures could be included in the list.
Thus in Aeschylus’ Seven against Thebes, in which Adrastos does not include himself
among the champions (see p. 321), both Eteoklos and Hippomedon are numbered
among the Seven; or additional Argives could be included from among the lesser
men if Polyneikes and Tydeus were excluded as foreigners.
AMPHIARAOS, the most formidable of the men who were selected as champions
by Adrastos, was a gifted seer like his forebear Melampous and realized that the
expedition was doomed to disaster. Foreknowing that none of the leaders would
return alive apart from Adrastos, he initially refused to take part and tried to
discourage the others. Anxious to ﬁnd a solution to this difﬁculty, Polyneikes sought
the advice of a prominent Argive, Iphis, son of Alektor (see p. 334), who told him
that the seer could be forced to take part if his wife ERIPHYLE desired it; for
Amphiaraos had once quarrelled with Adrastos over the kingdom, even driving him
into exile for a time (see p. 332), and when the pair had ﬁnally settled their differ-
ences, Adrastos had given his sister Eriphyle to Amphiaraos on the sworn agreement
that they should accept her decision if they should ever quarrel in the future. So

Polyneikes approached her in secret and promised her a splendid treasure, the divine
necklace of Harmonia, if she would order her husband to march off against Thebes
as Adrastos wished. In one version at least, Amphiaraos had foreseen trouble from
this quarter and had speciﬁcally forbidden her to accept any gift from Polyneikes,
but the temptation proved irresistible nevertheless. Eriphyle repaid the bribe by
sending her husband to his death, so becoming a byword for treachery. Setting off
under compulsion, and knowing that Eriphyle had allowed herself to be corrupted,
Amphiaraos ordered his son Alkmaion (and his other son Amphilochos too in one
version) to put her to death when he grew up, and to mount a second expedition
against Thebes at some future time.137
The Iliad reports that Tydeus and Polyneikes visited Mycenae before the war in
the hope of enlisting further allies; but although the Mycenaeans initially agreed to
provide a force of troops, Zeus deterred them by sending bad omens.138
The death of Opheltes and embassy of Tydeus
As Adrastos and his army were marching toward the Isthmus, they passed through
Nemea in the northern Argolid, where they became involved in a strange incident
that led to the founding of the Nemean Games. The city was ruled at that time by
Lykourgos, son of Pheres, an immigrant from Thessaly (see p. 426), who had
appointed HYPSIPYLE, the former queen of Lemnos, to act as nursemaid to his
infant son OPHELTES. As we will see, the Lemnian women had conspired together
to kill all their menfolk, but Hypsipyle had broken the agreement by sparing her
aged father Thoas (see p. 384); and when the other women had discovered this, they
had sold her into slavery. Or in another version, she had escaped abroad after her
action had been discovered, but had then been captured by pirates who had sold
her to Lykourgos.139 Adrastos and his companions now encountered her in Nemea
and asked her to show them the way to a spring, for they were thirsty after their
long journey (or else needed water for a sacriﬁce). So she placed the infant Opheltes
on a bed of wild parsley and led them to the water. Although an oracle had warned
that Opheltes should never be placed on the ground until he could walk, she thought
that he would be safe because he would not actually be in contact with the ground.
On returning from the spring, however, she found that the child had been killed
by a snake. Adrastos and his followers killed the snake, and interceded with
Lykourgos on Hypsipyle’s behalf; and they then gave little Opheltes a magniﬁcent
funeral, renaming him Archemoros (Beginning of Doom) because Amphiaraos
declared that his death was an evil sign that indicated that many members of the
army would lose their lives in the forthcoming conﬂict. They also held funeral games
in honour of the dead child, so founding the Nemean Games, at which the judges
wore dark clothing as a sign of mourning and the victors were awarded a crown of
wild parsley. As for Hypsipyle, she was ﬁnally rescued from her captivity by Euneos
and Thoas, the two sons whom she had borne to Jason.140
Before launching his assault against Thebes, Adrastos sent Tydeus ahead to the
city to see whether the dispute could be settled in Polyneikes’ favour by diplomatic
means. According to the Iliad, Tydeus set off after the army had passed some distance
on its way and had reached the thickly reeded Asopos (presumably the river of that
— The mythical history of Thebes —
318

name in southern Boeotia). Apollodorus states that he set off from Kithairon, in
much the same area, while Diodorus offers a different version in which Adrastos
sent him from Argos before the start of the expedition. As the story is recounted
in the Iliad, Tydeus found the Kadmeians (i.e. Thebans) feasting in the palace of
Eteokles on his arrival, and challenged them all to contests, doubtless in wrestling
or the like, which he won easily with a little help from Athena. Angered by the
humiliation, the Thebans arranged for ﬁfty young men to ambush him during his
return journey, but he killed all of them with the sole exception of Maion, son of
Haimon and grandson of Kreon, whom he spared in response to signs from the
gods. As in the case of the similar embassy before the Trojan War (see p. 454), the
mission failed in its main purpose.141
The ﬁghting at Thebes and fate of the Seven
Although we have almost no direct information on how the ﬁghting at Thebes was
described in the early epic tradition, there seems to have been general agreement
from an early period on the fate of the main Argive champions.142 After an initial

confrontation in which the Thebans were driven back into their city, the attackers
tried to storm the walls but were driven back in their turn. The major casualty
during the assault was the impiously arrogant Kapaneus, who boasted that he 
would enter and set ﬁre to the city whether Zeus wished it or not, provoking that
god to strike him with a thunderbolt while he was scaling the walls. According to
Apollodorus,143 this incident marked a turning-point, for it caused the other 
Argives to ﬂee back from the city walls. Either during the attack on the walls or
during a pause in the ﬁghting after the attackers fell back, Polyneikes and Eteokles
confronted one another in single combat and killed one another.144 As the battle
proceeded in front of the city, Tydeus was fatally wounded by Melanippos, son of
Astakos, a descendant of one of the Spartoi (Sown Men, who were supposed to have
founded the military caste at Thebes, see p. 296). Tydeus was a favourite of Athena,
who planned to confer immortality on him; but Amphiaraos hated him for his
violent ways and for having helped to instigate the war, and was determined to
frustrate the goddess’s intent. So he cut off the head of Melanippos and tossed it to
Tydeus in the expectation of a savage reaction; and when Tydeus cracked it open
to gulp down the brains of his killer, Athena was so revolted that she withheld the
magical potion that she had intended to apply to him. Melanippos was commonly
said to have been killed by Amphiaraos (although an interpolation in Apollodorus’
text suggests that Tydeus had managed to kill him after being wounded by him).145
Parthenopaios was killed by Periklymenos, son of Poseidon and Chloris, daughter
of Teiresias,146 who went on to pursue Amphiaraos from the battleﬁeld, and would

have struck him in the back with his spear if Zeus had not intervened by opening
up a chasm in the ground with a thunderbolt, so enabling the seer to disappear
beneath the earth together with his chariot and charioteer. This latter episode is
already described by Pindar; and it is reported elsewhere that the charioteer of
Amphiaraos was a certain Baton who was a kinsman of his.147 Amphiaraos vanished
from human sight, either at Knopia, a place near Thebes on the road to Potniai, or
further away at Harma (Chariot) between Thebes and the east coast, or at Oropos
on the frontier between Boeotia and Attica. He delivered oracles during his posthu-
mous existence, principally at Oropos but also at Knopia (hence the traditions that
located his disappearance at these places).148 Of all the Argive champions, Adrastos
alone escaped, thanks to the speed of his wondrous horse Areion, which was a child
of Poseidon by Demeter Erinys (see p. 101).149 No picturesque stories are associ-
ated with the deaths of the minor champions; according to Apollodorus, Eteoklos
and Hippomedon were killed by Leades and Ismaros respectively, two brothers of
the Melanippos who is mentioned above as the killer of Tydeus.150
Aeschylus presents an idiosyncratic account of the conﬂict in his Seven against Thebes. In this
tragedy, each of the seven champions from the Argive force is said to have confronted a
Theban defender at each of the seven gates, in accordance with the following arrangement:
Gate
Assailant
Defender
Proitides
Tydeus
Melanippos, son of Astakos
Elektrai
Kapaneus
Polyphontes
Neistai
Eteoklos
Megareus, son of Kreon

Hippomedon
Hyperbios, son of Oinops
Borrhaiai
Parthenopaios
Aktor, son of Oinops
Homoloides
Amphiaraos
Lasthenes
Hypsistai
Polyneikes
Eteokles
With the exception of Eteokles, Melanippos and Megareus, the defenders are otherwise
unknown, and some of them may have been invented by Aeschylus himself. Towards the
end of the play, a messenger reports that all has gone well for the Thebans at six of the
gates, but that the king of Thebes and his brother have killed one another at the seventh
gate;151 this would mean, of course, that the outcome was settled by a series of single combats
at the individual gates before there could be occasion for any subsequent ﬁghting in front
of the city. To maintain a consistent pattern, Aeschylus departs from the usual tradition by
excluding Adrastos, as a known survivor, from his list of champions. It will be noted, further-
more, that except in the case of the opponents of Polyneikes and Tydeus, the defenders who
kill the champions are not the men who are usually said to have killed them.
For a tale from Euripides in which Menoikeus, son of Kreon, is said to have sacriﬁced
himself to ensure victory for Thebes, see p. 330.
Kreon tries to forbid the burial of the Argive dead
After the death of the two sons of Oedipus, KREON took power at Thebes once
again, either as king in his own right or as regent for Laodamas, the infant son of
Eteokles. He ordered that the Theban dead should be buried with all honour, espe-
cially Eteokles, but that bodies of the attackers should be left to rot, a decree that

offended not only against the common feelings of humanity, but also against the
gods above and below, since the latter were defrauded of their due and the former
polluted by the corpses that were left in their realm.152 There is no indication that
this story of the prohibition was known before the ﬁfth century BC (although it
should be remembered that we have very little early evidence on anything connected
with the war). When the fateful decree ﬁrst appears in Attic tragedy, it has two
notable consequences: Kreon’s niece Antigone tries to bury her brother Polyneikes,
setting in course a train of events that brings disaster to the Theban royal family,
and Adrastos enlists the aid of Theseus and the Athenians to force the Thebans to
allow the burial of the Argive dead. Polyneikes was ﬁnally buried at Thebes, along-
side his brother in some accounts,153 while the bodies of the other champions (apart
from Amphiaraos of course) were taken off to Attica to be buried at Eleusis.154
Pindar is doubtless drawing on the early epic tradition when he speaks of seven
funeral pyres burning near Thebes itself.155
The decree forbidding the burial of the Argive dead is ﬁrst attested for the
Eleusinians of Aeschylus, a lost tragedy dating to the end of the ﬁrst quarter of the
ﬁfth century. In this play, Theseus helped Adrastos to recover the bodies of his
comrades by negotiating a settlement, evidently with the threat of force, rather than
by defeating the Thebans in battle as in the usual account.156 Pausanias reports that
the Thebans themselves preferred this version of the story,157 as is wholly under-
standable; some said that this was the ﬁrst truce ever to be arranged for the burial
of the dead.158 The title of Aeschylus’ play suggests that the chorus would have
been made up of citizens of Eleusis, the town where the Argive dead would have
been laid to rest. When the theme is taken up again in Euripides’ Suppliants, a play
written half a century later, the chorus is made up of the mothers of the Argive
dead, who accompany Adrastos to Athens and appeal as suppliants to Aithra, the
mother of Theseus, at the shrine of Demeter at Eleusis. On arriving to investigate,
Theseus responds sympathetically to the entreaties of Adrastos and the women of
the chorus, who are now supported by Aithra, and agrees to take up their cause.
Ignoring a Theban herald who asks him to expel Adrastos and warns him not to
set foot on Theban soil, Theseus collects an army together to attack Thebes, defeats
Kreon and the Thebans, and takes the dead back to give them an honourable burial.
Since Kapaneus was killed by a thunderbolt from Zeus, his corpse is marked off
from the others as sacred and burned on a separate funeral-pyre;159 as it is burning,
his wife Euadne throws herself on to it to join him in death,160 an act very remi-
niscent of Hindu sati, but without parallel in Greek mythology. It is a happy thought
of various latish authors to make the suppliants take refuge at the altar of Mercy
(Eleos) in Athens rather than at Eleusis.161
The mythology of Antigone
The standard version of the story of ANTIGONE was established by Sophocles in
his play of that name. Although the king has forbidden the burial of Polyneikes on
pain of death, his sister Antigone, as his nearest surviving relative, is determined
to bury him nonetheless, and the play begins as she vainly attempts to persuade
ISMENE, her more cautious sister, to join her in the enterprise.162 So Antigone was
— The mythical history of Thebes —
322

obliged to take action on her own, and granted her brother a formal burial at least
by scattering some dust over his corpse. The dust was soon noticed by Kreon’s
guards, who brushed it away and lay in wait nearby; and when Antigone returned
to replace it and to pour funeral-libations, they captured her and hauled her in front
of Kreon.163 She defended her actions with stubborn courage, arguing that the king
had abused his authority and that the unwritten and unfailing laws of the gods took
precedence over his arbitrary decree; but her deﬁance merely served to antagonize
him, and he resolved that she should be walled up alive in a tomb.164 When Ismene
was then brought in front of him, she was so moved by the plight of her sister that
she asked to share in her guilt and punishment, but Antigone protested that she
had no right to make any such claim since she had failed to take action when the
moment had demanded.165 Kreon’s son HAIMON, who was betrothed to Antigone,
arrived after the two girls were led away, and tried to persuade his father to show
mercy to his ﬁancée, warning him that the Thebans sympathized with her and were
saying that she deserved to be honoured rather than killed. But Kreon refused to
listen and ordered that the sentence should be put into effect.166 He was ﬁnally
obliged to relent, however, when the seer Teiresias revealed that the gods had been
offended by his prohibition of the burial, and were therefore rejecting all Theban
sacriﬁces and prayers;167 but his change of heart came too late since Antigone had
already hanged herself in her sepulchre. As the audience subsequently learns from
a messenger, Kreon entered the vault to ﬁnd that she was hanging from a linen
noose, while Haimon, who had entered just before, was embracing her corpse and
bewailing her fate. When Kreon called out to him, Haimon drew his sword and
tried to strike his father with it, but missed him and then committed suicide by
driving it into his own body. On hearing this news from the messenger, Eurydike,
the wife of Kreon, retired into the palace to kill herself in her turn; and Kreon is
left to contemplate his guilt as the play draws to a close.168
Little is known of the prior mythology of Antigone; indeed, there is no record even of her
name until the ﬁfth century BC. She ﬁrst appears in a passage from Pherecydes, who mentions
her along with her usual brothers and sisters as one of the children who were borne to Oedipus
by his second wife Euryganeia;169 in the tragic and later tradition, of course, they are regarded
as children of Iokaste. In the present text of Aeschylus’ Seven against Thebes, Antigone and
Ismene are introduced into the ﬁnal section of the play, in which they lament the death of
their brothers until they are interrupted by a herald, who arrives to announce that the ruling
body of the city has forbidden the burial of Polyneikes; Antigone then declares openly that
she will see to his burial, to the approval of the chorus of Theban women, who offer to form
the funeral cortege for the brothers.170 If this scene formed part of the original play, it would
have been written some twenty-ﬁve years before Sophocles treated the same theme in the
Antigone. There is good reason to suppose, however, that the end of Aeschylus’ play was altered
at a later date, perhaps in the ﬁnal decade of the ﬁfth century, well after the production of the
Antigone. The laments uttered by the two sisters prior to the arrival of the herald may origin-
ally have been shared out between the two half-choruses. The account of the interdiction and
Antigone’s deﬁance of it in the ﬁnal scene with the herald differs in important respects from
that offered by Sophocles. The edict forbidding the burial has been issued by the deputies of
the people (probouloi) rather than by Kreon;171 no penalty is announced for disobedience; and
it is indicated that Antigone will give her brother a proper burial with the help of the other
Theban women rather than a token burial on her own in secret.172 It is quite possible that

this comes closer to the original story than does the starker version in Sophocles’ play, who
heightens the dramatic tension by presenting Antigone as a solitary heroine who engages in
a battle of wills with the king.
Ion of Chios, a poet of the ﬁfth century BC, is reported to have written in a dithyramb that
Antigone and Ismene were burned to death in the temple of Hera by Laodamas, son of
Eteokles.173 Although we have no record of how they had offended him, they had presumably
ﬂed to the temple for sanctuary, obliging him to resort to this act of sacrilege if he was to
cause their death. It is at least possible that they had angered him by burying Polyneikes
against his orders.
To return to the usual story in which Antigone is arraigned before Kreon, there are versions
in which she is saved from death by her ﬁancé Haimon. Hyginus records a version of this kind
in which Antigone removed Polyneikes’ body under cover of darkness with the help of his
wife Argeia and placed it on the funeral-pyre of Eteokles. She was captured by the guards,
although her accomplice managed to escape, and brought in front of Kreon, who handed her
over to Haimon to be put to death; but Haimon, who was betrothed to her, as in Sophocles’
version, loved her too much to make more than a pretence of obeying, and secretly hid her
away with some shepherds. While she was in hiding, she bore Haimon a son, here unnamed,
who visited Thebes when he grew up to take part in some games. Since the descendants of
the Spartoi could be identiﬁed by a distinctive birthmark (shaped like a lance), Kreon real-
ized who he must be and ordered his execution. The king remained obdurate even when
Herakles (who spent his earlier years in Thebes as a subject of Kreon) begged him to show
mercy; and Haimon was so distressed that he took his own life after ﬁrst killing his secret wife
Antigone.174 Although some have argued that this account was largely based on the lost
Antigone of Euripides (in which Antigone is known to have married Haimon after her capture
and to have borne him a son called Maion), it seems more likely that it is a composite version
drawn from a variety of sources. What little is left of Euripides’ plot suggests that a happy
ending was somehow achieved, perhaps with Haimon being allowed to marry Antigone
through the intervention of Dionysos, who is addressed by somebody in terms of zealous
adoration in a surviving fragment.175
As we have seen above, Haimon and his son Maion were already known in early epic as
a victim of the Sphinx and an opponent of Tydeus respectively (see pp. 309 and 319); but
these traditions are inconsistent with those that present Haimon as the ﬁancé or secret lover
of Antigone, since he would have been killed before her birth or at least have belonged to
an earlier generation. Sophocles is the ﬁrst author to present him as being betrothed to
Antigone,176 and it is quite possible that he invented the idea, so preparing the way for
Euripides to make a further alteration in the tradition by presenting Maion as his son by
Antigone; although Maion would certainly not have been the product of any secret union
in the early epic tradition, we have no record of the name of his original mother.
Pausanias mentions that there was a place near Thebes called ‘Antigone’s Pull’ (Syrma
Antigone¯s); according to the local tradition, it was called by that name because Antigone had
tried to carry Polyneikes’ body from there, but had found it too heavy to lift and had there-
fore pulled it along the ground to place it on Eteokles’ pyre.177 According to another local
tradition, Maion buried Tydeus beside the road from Thebes to Chalkis after the defeat of the
Seven178 (evidently giving him a proper burial because Tydeus had spared his life previously,
as was well known from the Iliad, see p. 319).
We may conclude with a mysterious early account of the death of Ismene. The elegiac
poet Mimnermus (second half of the seventh century BC) is reported to have stated that she
was killed by Tydeus at the instigation of Athena while she was having intercourse with a
certain Theoklymenos. There is otherwise no record of a hero of this name at Thebes. When
the incident is portrayed, however, on a Corinthian black-ﬁgure amphora of c.560 BC (Louvre
— The mythical history of Thebes —
324

E640), the naked ﬁgure which is shown ﬂeeing as Tydeus threatens Ismene with a sword is
named as Periklymenos instead; and since Periklymenos was mentioned in the Thebais as
the killer of Parthenopaios (one of the Seven, see p. 320), it is reasonable to assume that
the Theoklymenos in the report above can be identiﬁed with this Theban hero.179 Tydeus
might have been in a position to kill Ismene while he was visiting Thebes as an ambas-
sador, but we have no way of telling why Athena should have wanted him to do so, or why
she should have chosen him in particular for this task. Pherecydes also states that Ismene
was killed by Tydeus, at a spring that bore her name.180
The Epigonoi capture Thebes under the leadership of Alkmaion
Ten years after the expedition of the Seven, the sons of the fallen champions launched
a second expedition against Thebes to avenge the fate of their fathers. The force was
commanded by ALKMAION, son of Amphiaraos, who had been ordered by his
father to attack Thebes when he came of age; and the attackers were destined to
succeed on this occasion just as their fathers had been destined to fail.181 The leading
warriors were known as the EPIGONOI (i.e. the Afterborn or Younger Generation;
the Greek term lacks the pejorative associations of its English derivative ‘epigone’).
As in the case of the Seven, the various catalogues of the Epigonoi are not entirely
consistent.182 Since most authors agreed on the identities of six of the Seven, we
will begin with the sons of these. Alkmaion takes the place of his father Amphiaraos
on this second expedition, often in the company of his younger brother Amphi-
lochos. Adrastos accompanies the expedition, but is now too old to ﬁght as one of
the leading warriors; he is replaced in this respect by his son Aigialeus, who will
be the only leader to die on this successful expedition, just as his father was the
only champion to return from defeat on the ﬁrst occasion. Polyneikes is replaced by
his son Thersandros (and sometimes by a lesser son also, a certain Timeas or
Adrastos). Thersandros will become the new king of Thebes after the city is captured.
Tydeus is replaced by his son Diomedes, Kapaneus by Sthenelos, and Parthenopaios
by Promachos (or else a son named Stratolaos, or Therimenes, or Biantes). The last
member of the Seven was variously named as Mekisteus, Eteoklos or Hippomedon,
and sons of these – Euryalos, Polydoros and Maion respectively – may sometimes
be found accordingly among the Epigonoi. The number of the Epigonoi was not
limited to seven as in the case of the champions on the ﬁrst expedition; most cata-
logues list eight or more, largely because two sons of Amphiaraos or of Polyneikes
were often said to have joined the Epigonoi.
It was perhaps inevitable that some authors should have recycled the story of
Eriphyle’s treachery (see p. 318) by suggesting that Thersandros, son of Polyneikes,
bribed her to persuade her sons to join the Epigonoi by offering her the robe of
Harmonia, just as Polyneikes had bribed her to force her husband to join the Seven
by offering her the necklace of Harmonia. This was not a happy inspiration, however,
since her sons had no reason to fear disaster as their father had, and she was not in
a position to compel them in any case as she had been with their father. Apollodorus
offers some sort of explanation, saying that her persuasions were needed because
Alkmaion was reluctant to march off before he had punished her for her betrayal of
Amphiaraos. It will be remembered that Amphiaraos had ordered Alkmaion to

avenge him. In Diodorus’ account, Alkmaion is said to have consulted the Delphic
oracle about the campaign and the punishment of his mother, and was told that he
should join the campaign and also take action against his mother, all the more so
because she had now accepted the second bribe to endanger his own life.183
Very little is recorded of the campaign of the Epigonoi, which was described in
a poem in the epic cycle. Pindar reports that Amphiaraos delivered a prophecy from
his grave when they arrived at Thebes, foretelling that Alkmaion would enter the
city ﬁrst of all carrying a shield showing an image of a dragon, and that the omens
were more favourable for Adrastos than they had been on the previous expedition,
except with regard to his own family (for his son was destined to be the only victim
among the Argive leaders).184 In Apollodorus’ account, which is probably based on
the early epic tradition, the Epigonoi ravaged the villages around Thebes to provoke
the Thebans to venture out of their city, and then defeated them in battle, presum-
ably at some site near the city. Although LAODAMAS, son of Eteokles, the king
and commander of the Thebans, killed Aigialeus, the son of Adrastos, he was soon
killed in his turn by Alkmaion, and the Thebans were so dismayed by his death
that they lost courage and took refuge behind their city walls. Realizing that the
city was doomed, the seer Teiresias advised them to send a herald to the enemy to
distract them with talk of a settlement while the citizens made a secret departure
by night. As soon as the Argives realized that the Thebans had ﬂed, they entered
the city, plundered it, and pulled down the walls. In accordance with a previous
vow, they sent the ﬁnest of the spoils to Delphi to be dedicated to Apollo (see
further on p. 331).185 According to Herodotus, the Theban exiles settled far away
in Hestiaiotis, the north-western region of Thessaly, displacing the Dorians who had
previously lived there; the historian may well have drawn this information from the
early epic account in the Epigonoi (which he was certainly acquainted with, as we
know from a passing allusion in another context).186
Pausanias offers a different account of the conﬂict, saying that the Thebans estab-
lished a base about eight miles north-east of their city at Glisas, and were defeated
in a battle nearby. Laodamas killed Aigialeus as above, but survived in this version
to lead the defeated troops back into Thebes. The supposed tomb of the Argive
dead could be seen at Glisas; Promachos, son of Parthenopaios, is mentioned as
having been included among the fallen. Laodamas ﬂed from Thebes under cover of
nightfall with the citizens who chose to accompany him, and settled in Illyria (in
the north-west adjoining the Adriatic).187 To reconcile this account with the one
above in which the Theban emigrants were said to have settled in Thessaly, it was
suggested that some of the Thebans were unwilling to follow Laodamas all the way
to Illyria, and therefore turned aside to settle in Thessaly; this tale also provided an
explanation for the name of one of the gates of Thebes, for it was said that this last
group were subsequently invited home, and that the gate through which they entered
was named the Homoloidian Gate after Homole, the place of their exile in
Thessaly.188 This second account of the war and its aftermath was probably of later
origin than the preceding version. Although it is not impossible that the battle was
set at Glisas in early epic, this seems unlikely in view of town’s position, for it lay
well out of the way of any army approaching Thebes from the south; Hellanicus in
the ﬁfth century BC is the ﬁrst author to name it as the battle-site.189
— The mythical history of Thebes —
326

The Epigonoi entered Thebes unopposed after it had been deserted by most of its
citizens, and installed Thersandros, the son of Polyneikes, as its ruler.190 The
conquerors were said to have pulled down the walls, and the city ceased to be of any
great importance in mythical history thenceforth. The new king and his descendants
will be considered below (see pp. 328ff). As the Argive army was marching home to
Argos, Adrastos died on the way at Megara of old age and sorrow at the death of his
son. His tomb could be seen in the city (although he also had heroic shrines in other
places), and his son Aigialeus was buried nearby, at Pagai in the Megarid.191
The later history of Alkmaion
After arriving back in Argos, ALKMAION exacted vengeance against his mother
Eriphyle for having caused the death of his father a decade before (see p. 318), by
putting her to death, taking this action on his own or in conjunction with his
brother Amphilochos. Although he had acquired the approval of Apollo at Delphi
beforehand (either before or after the war), he was persecuted and sent mad never-
theless by his mother’s Erinyes (Furies), just as Orestes was supposed to have been
after killing his mother Klytaimnestra (see pp. 511ff).192 When ﬁrst overcome by
madness, Alkmaion ﬂed to his grandfather Oikles in Arcadia, and then onward to
Psophis in the same province, where he was puriﬁed by the local ruler, Phegeus.
The king offered him his daughter Arsinoe as a wife, and he started a new life with
her in her homeland, giving her the necklace and robe of Harmonia as wedding-
gifts. He was still polluted, however, in spite of the puriﬁcation that he had received,
and the land became barren on account of his presence. An oracle advised him to
search for a land on which the sun had not yet shone at the time when he had
killed his mother;193 and his search took him across the Isthmus to the Greek main-
land. After spending some time with Oineus at Calydon, he travelled further north
into Epirus and visited the springs of the great river Acheloos, where he received
puriﬁcation from the god of the river. He ﬁnally discovered the land that the oracle
had spoken of when he arrived at the mouth of the Acheloos at the entrance to the
Corinthian Gulf; for new land had been laid down there by silt from the river since
the time of his mother’s death. He made this his new home, marrying Kallirhoe, a
daughter of the river-god. When she subsequently asked to be given the necklace
and robe of Harmonia, threatening to leave him if she failed to acquire them, he
returned to Psophis and tricked Phegeus into handing them over, by claiming that
the Delphic oracle had advised him that he should dedicate them at Delphi if he
was to be cured of his madness. After his departure, however, a servant of his told
Phegeus that he was really taking the treasures to his new wife. So the king ordered
his two sons, Pronoos and Agenor, to lay an ambush for Alkmaion and put him to
death. When their sister Arsinoe reproached them afterwards for having murdered
her former husband, they took her to Tegea in south-eastern Arcadia and handed
her over to the ruler, Agapenor, as a slave-woman, telling him that she herself had
committed the murder.
On learning of Alkmaion’s fate, his new wife Kallirhoe appealed to Zeus (who
had become her lover) to cause her two young sons, AKARNAN and AMPHO-
TEROS, to grow to maturity immediately to enable them to avenge their father’s

murder. Her request was duly granted, and the two young men (as they had now
become) set off at once for Arcadia. They happened to call in at the palace of
Agapenor while the sons of Phegeus were still there after bringing their sister, and
they took advantage of this opportunity to kill them; and they then travelled on to
Psophis to kill Phegeus, the instigator of the murder, along with his wife. Although
they were pursued afterwards as far as Tegea, they were saved by the intervention
of the Tegeans and some Argives, and hurried back to their mother to report their
success. At the order of Acheloos, they dedicated the robe and necklace of Harmonia
to Apollo at Delphi. Akarnan was the eponym of Acarnania, the westernmost
province of Central Greece; he and his brother were said to have colonized the area
with settlers assembled in Epirus. Their new home lay close to their birthplace, for
the Acheloos ran to the sea along the border between Acarnania and Aetolia, the
adjoining province to the east.194
Thersandros, king of Thebes, and his descendants
THERSANDROS, son of Polyneikes, had become the new ruler of Thebes in the
mean time, ten years after his father had been killed while trying to seize the throne
from Eteokles. Since Thersandros was of Kadmeian descent like the ousted king,
Laodamas, son of Eteokles, the city continued to be ruled by the old royal family
in spite of its fall, even if it was not the centre of power that it had once been.
Demonassa, daughter of Teiresias, the wife of Thersandros, bore him a son and heir
who was named TEISAMENOS (Avenger) in commemoration of his father’s achieve-
ment in avenging the defeat and death of Polyneikes.195 After ruling uneventfully
for some years, Thersandros set out for Troy as the leader of the Boeotian contin-
gent; but he never arrived there because he was killed on the way by Telephos, king
of Mysia, when the Greeks attacked his land in the belief that it was Troy (see 
p. 446). Since Teisamenos was not yet of ﬁghting age, the Thebans chose Peneleos,
son of Hippalkimos (a descendant of Boiotos, son of Poseidon, the eponym of
Boeotia) as their new leader.196
Although Thersandros is never mentioned in the Homeric epics, he must have been an
ancient ﬁgure since the story of his death was recounted in the Cypria, an early epic in the
Trojan cycle.197 The Catalogue of Ships in the Iliad names Peneleos and Leitos, son of
Elektryon, another descendant of Boiotos, as the leaders of the Boeotians (along with three
obscure heroes, Arkesilaos, Prothoenor and Klonios, who are all killed in the ﬁghting and
were probably invented by Homer himself). The most striking feature of this passage in the
Iliad is the fact that Thebes is not singled out from the other Boeotian towns as a place of
any special signiﬁcance; indeed there is no mention of Thebes as such, but only of Hypothebai
(i.e. Lower Thebes), apparently a settlement that had grown up around the ruined and aban-
doned city.198 Setting aside the obviously fabulous features in the story of the Theban wars,
the legend may well have had some basis in historical fact, in so far as it reﬂected a serious
decline in the city’s fortunes at the end of the Mycenaean period.
When Peneleos was killed toward the end of the Trojan War by Eurypylos, the last
major ally of the Trojans (see p. 472), Teisamenos was old enough to take over as
leader. He returned home safely to Thebes to rule as his father’s successor; but his
— The mythical history of Thebes —
328

son Autesion was troubled by ancient family curses and ﬁnally went abroad on the
advice of the Delphic oracle, accompanying the Heraklids and Dorians to the
Peloponnese. On his departure, the Thebans offered the throne to Peneleos’ grandson
Damasichthon, and they were then ruled by him and his heirs until the monarchy
was abolished in the time of his grandson.199
The exiled Autesion had two notable children, Argeia and Theras, who rose to importance
in their new homeland in the Peloponnese. Argeia married one of the Heraklid leaders,
Aristodemos, who fathered the ﬁrst Heraklid kings of Sparta by her, or else came to rule
there himself (see further on p. 291). Since Aristodemos died while his twin sons were still
very young in either case, their uncle Theras ruled the kingdom as regent while they were
growing up; and after delivering the throne to them, he sailed abroad to establish a royal
line on the island of Thera (see further on p. 571).
Teiresias, the great seer of Thebes, and his daughter Manto
Before departing from Thebes, we must consider the career of the great Theban seer
TEIRESIAS, whose life was thought to have spanned most of the earlier history of
the city from the reign of Pentheus until the arrival of the Epigonoi. His fame is
as old as Homer, who reports that Persephone granted him the special privilege of
retaining his wits in Hades, while other dead mortals ﬂit around as empty shades.200
He was of good Theban birth as a descendant of Oudaios, one of the men who had
sprung from the dragon’s teeth; his father was a certain Eueres and his mother a
nymph called Chariklo. He lived a prodigious while, seven generations according
to the Hesiodic Melampodeia,201 and he was famous on two accounts, for his deeds
as a seer, and for having turned into a woman and back into a man.202 His sex-
changes resulted from encounters with snakes. According to a version ascribed to
Hesiod (presumably from the Melampodeia, a poem concerned with seers), he once
saw a pair of snakes mating on Mt Kyllene in Arcadia, and was transformed into a
woman when he struck and wounded them; but when he saw the same snakes mating
on a second occasion, he was changed back into a man. Ovid states that he remained
a woman for seven years until he saw the same snakes mating again, and struck
them again when he saw them (as he is also reported to have done in other sources,
and may already have been the case in the full Hesiodic account). He either struck
the snakes with his staff or trampled on them.203 In another version, he was turned
into a woman when he saw two snakes coupling and killed the female, and was
turned back into a man when he subsequently killed a male snake in the same
circumstances.204 There was disagreement on whether the incident occurred on Mt
Kithairon in his Boeotian homeland or on Kyllene in Arcadia.205
In the Hesiodic account, he came to acquire his prophetic powers as a result of
his experiences as a woman. For when Zeus and Hera were once arguing as to
whether men or women gain more pleasure from sexual intercourse, they decided
to refer the matter to the arbitration of Teiresias, who was alone in a position to
judge from personal experience; and he responded that if the pleasure may be judged
on a scale of ten, a man enjoys one part only while a woman enjoys all ten. Or in
a secondary version, he is reported to have said that a man enjoys one part and a
woman nine, as if there were ten units of pleasure to be shared out between them.206

Hera was angered by his reply, presumably because she thought it shaming for
women, and reacted by turning him blind; but Zeus, who was evidently pleased to
have found his arguments conﬁrmed, compensated him by granting him prophetic
powers and an extended life-span.207
Apollodorus remarks that conﬂicting explanations were offered for the blindness of
Teiresias, for some also said that he was blinded by the gods for betraying their 
secrets to mortals (which would imply that he already possessed his prophetic powers
at the time), while Pherecydes said that he was blinded by Athena because he saw her
naked (in unstated circumstances). The goddess covered his eyes with her hands to
render him sightless; and when his mother Chariklo, who was presumably present
because she was bathing with Athena, asked her to restore his sight, she was unable
to do so, but compensated him instead by enabling him to understand the language
of birds (i.e. granting him divinatory powers, cf. p. 426), and by giving him a 
cornel-wood staff to enable him to walk like those who can see.208 Callimachus
recounts the story at some length in his ﬁfth Hymn, the Bath of Pallas, reporting that
the incident occurred as Athena was bathing during the midday heat in Hippocrene 
(the Horse’s Spring) on Mt Helikon in Boeotia. She was accompanied by a single
companion, the nymph Chariklo, who was a particular friend of hers. When the
young Teiresias, who was out hunting on the mountain with his dogs, happened 
to come to the spring to quench his thirst, he saw Athena naked and was told by 
her that he would be deprived of his eyesight forever. Chariklo cried out in reproach
and distress, asking if this was what was meant by the friendship of a goddess; but
Athena assured her that she was not to blame for her son’s blindness since the 
laws of Kronos (i.e. divine law) ordained that the punishment must follow from 
the offence. Although she therefore had no power to alter Teiresias’ fate in 
this regard, she told Chariklo to cease from her laments because she would confer
beneﬁts on him that would far outweigh his loss, by granting him prophetic powers,
and a long life, and unimpaired wits after his death.209 While recounting this story,
Callimachus refers to the comparable story of Aktaion, who suffered an even worse
punishment after seeing Artemis naked (see p. 298);210 it is likely that one of these
stories inspired the development of the other, but we cannot tell for sure which was
of earlier origin.
In Attic tragedy and the later tradition (and doubtless in early epic too, although
we have no deﬁnite evidence on the matter), Teiresias was said to have performed
valuable services for Thebes and the Theban kings at various stages in the troubled
history of the city. When Thebes was about to be attacked by the Seven, for instance,
he revealed that there was only one salvation for the city, since the blood-guilt for
the sacred dragon (see p. 296) still weighed heavily on it; to atone for its death and
ﬁnally allay the anger of Ares, it was necessary that a descendant of the Spartoi who
was still a virgin should sacriﬁce his own life at the spot where the dragon had been
killed. MENOIKEUS, son of Kreon, who alone answered to these speciﬁcations,
resolved to take this action for the sake of the city in spite of his father’s opposi-
tion, and stabbed himself accordingly on the city walls, ensuring that he would fall
into the former lair of the dragon below. This legend and indeed Menoikeus himself
ﬁrst appear in the Phoenician Women of Euripides.211 Teiresias plays a central role in
three other surviving plays from the same period. In Euripides’ Bacchae, he vainly
— The mythical history of Thebes —
330

attempts to persuade Pentheus to stop opposing Dionysos and his cult;212 in
Sophocles’ Oedipus the King, as we have seen, he reluctantly reveals that Oedipus
himself is to blame for the plague that has fallen on Thebes; and in Sophocles’
Antigone, he warns Kreon that the gods have been angered by his decree forbidding
the burial of Polyneikes and by his treatment of Antigone. In the dramatic context,
the seer tends to be greeted with disbelief or scorn when he ﬁrst offers his advice
or revelations. It is recorded elsewhere, among other things, that he advised Laios
to appease Hera for having abducted the young Chrysippos; that he told Amphitryon
that Zeus had assumed his form to sleep with his wife (see p. 247), and that he
revealed the destiny that awaited Herakles after the infant hero ﬁrst demonstrated
his prowess by strangling two snakes (see p. 249).
Teiresias met his long-delayed death when the glory of his city was brought to
an end by the victory of the Epigonoi. As he was ﬂeeing the area along with most
of the other citizens, he stopped to drink at the spring of Tilphousa (see p. 144) in
western Boeotia, and expired as his was doing so, apparently because of the chill of
the water. His tomb could be seen beside the spring.213 He had a daughter MANTO
(Divineress) who was captured at Thebes by the Epigonoi and sent to Delphi along
with other plunder, animate and inanimate, as an offering to Apollo; for they had
vowed to dedicate the ﬁnest of the spoils to the god if they conquered the city.214
Some said that Teiresias was captured too and sent off to Delphi along with his
daughter, but died on the way at Tilphousa.215
Apollo was able to make good use of Manto by sending her over to Klaros, near Kolophon
on the west coast of Asia Minor, to found the celebrated oracle of Apollo Klarios. In the
earliest version of the story, he instructed her to marry whomever she ﬁrst met on emerging
from his oracle at Delphi, and this turned out to be a Mycenaean called Rhakios, who took
her across the Aegean to the site of Klaros (a journey that would have been difﬁcult for a
woman on her own). After her arrival, she wept at the sad fate of her ravaged city, hence
the name of Klaros (here interpreted as being derived from klaein, to weep). A spring was
formed from her tears, presumably the sacred spring from which the prophet of the oracle
used to drink before delivering his prophecies.216 In another version of the story, Rhakios
was a Cretan who had already established himself in the region of Kolophon with a group
of settlers from his native island. The Delphic oracle ordered Manto to cross over the Aegean
along with some other captives from Thebes; and when they arrived in Asia, they were
captured by some of the Cretan settlers and taken to Rhakios, who asked Manto to become
his wife and invited the other Thebans to become citizens of his colony.217 Manto bore him
a son, MOPSOS, who became a celebrated seer like his mother and grandfather, and served
as the prophet of Klarian Apollo; for his main stories, see p. 488.
In a lost play by Euripides, Alkmaion in Corinth, Alkmaion was said to have fathered two
children by Manto, a son Amphilochos and a daughter Tisiphone. He entrusted them to
Kreon, king of Corinth, to be reared, but Tisiphone grew up to be so beautiful that the king’s
wife began to imagine that her husband might fall in love with her, and sold her into slavery
for fear of being displaced. As chance would have it, she was purchased by Alkmaion, who
kept her as a maidservant without realizing that she was his daughter. The truth ﬁnally
emerged, however, when he returned to Corinth to recover his two children. Since this story
conﬂicts with Manto’s usual legend, and there is no previous record of Tisiphone or the present
Amphilochos (who is evidently a doublet of Amphilochos, son of Amphiaraos, see p. 325),
there is good reason to suppose that this story was invented by Euripides himself.218

The implications of the Theban Wars for the dynastic 
history of the Argolid
At the time of the Theban wars, which took place a generation or so before the
Trojan War, the Argolid was no longer under common rule, but had come to be
divided into two separate sections for reasons that were considered in Chapter 7 (see
pp. 237ff). The north-western section, which was ruled from Mycenae, had fallen
under the control of Atreus’ branch of the Pelopid family, while the other section
of the province, whose main city was Argos, was still under the control of the old
Argive ruling family and the royal lines established by Bias and Melampous (see 
p. 429 for the origin of the latter). Although Adrastos tried to enlist the Mycenaeans
for the expedition of the Seven (see p. 318), the Argive cities under Pelopid rule
took no part in either of the Theban wars and were unaffected by their outcome;
but the dynastic history of the other section of the Argolid was greatly affected by
the two wars, since many leading members of its ruling families were killed in them
or as a consequence of them.
It will be remembered that the three ruling lines in this section of the Argolid
were a branch of the old Inachid line, as descended from Proitos, and two newer
lines founded by Bias and Melampous, two brothers from outside who won shares
of Proitos’ kingdom. The two latter families are particularly prominent in the myth-
ology of the Theban wars. Adrastos, a grandson of Bias, and Amphiaraos, a
great-grandson of Melampous, were the foremost Argive leaders in the expedition
of the Seven (see Tables 14 and 13); but Proitos’ Inachid line was also represented,
in the person of Kapaneus and Eteoklos (see Table 5). Although ADRASTOS, son
of Talaos, who ruled from his palace in the city of Argos, was not the only king in
the land, he was apparently acknowledged as the overlord of all the non-Pelopid
lands of the Argolid at the outset of the Theban wars; his status in that regard may
be compared to that of his grandson Diomedes at the time of the Trojan War. His
authority had been painfully acquired, however, since he and his family, the Biantids,
had previously met with defeat in a power-struggle with Amphiaraos, who had been
supported by his own family and also by the Proitids. Adrastos had been forced into
exile as a consequence, and had sought refuge in the city of Sicyon to the west of
Corinth. His Sicyonian connections were certainly very ancient since the Iliad refers
to him as a former king of the city.219 According to one tradition, he chose it as
his sanctuary because his mother was a daughter of Polybos, king of Sicyon, and he
inherited the throne after the death of the king as his closest male descendant; or
else he married a daughter of Polybos after his arrival and came to inherit the throne
because the king had no sons of his own.220 Amphiaraos held power in Argos in
the mean time, but eventually decided to negotiate a settlement with Adrastos for
unrecorded reasons. So Adrastos was able to return home, and established a domi-
nant position in the land (whether immediately or by degrees). To seal his
reconciliation with Amphiaraos, he offered his sister Eriphyle to him as a wife; and
in the hope of securing their new-found friendship, the two brothers-in-law swore
to accept Eriphyle’s decision if they should ever have any serious disagreement in
the future (for she could be expected to be fair-minded as the sister of the one and
wife of the other).221 Although this may have seemed an excellent idea at the time,
— The mythical history of Thebes —
332

it would bring nothing but disaster as we have seen (p. 317) because Eriphyle would
allow herself to be bribed into imposing a decision that was detrimental to her
husband and indeed to Adrastos too.
Amphiaraos was a great-grandson of Melampous and the only son of his father
Oikles222 (who has no myths of his own); he took part in the expedition of the
Seven as the only member of his line who was available to do so. Although he could
foresee by his own prophetic powers that he would not return, Eriphyle forced him
to march off with Adrastos. His two sons, Alkmaion and Amphilochos, survived
the second Theban war, but were not destined to play any signiﬁcant part in Theban
affairs. Alkmaion, who would otherwise have inherited his father’s position, was
obliged to depart into exile after killing his mother to avenge his father’s fate 
(see pp. 327ff); and he was killed before the Trojan War in circumstances already
described. His two sons, Akarnan and Amphoteros, were born abroad, and
remained abroad in Acarnania (see p. 328). His brother Amphilochos seems to have
lived in Argos after returning from the war, though not as a ﬁgure of any promi-
nence, and later took part in the Trojan War, again in no prominent capacity. He
had inherited his father’s prophetic powers, and joined together with another seer
to found an oracle in Asia Minor after the war, returning to Argos for a brief visit
only (see p. 489). Since he left no children, this Melampodid line in Argos died
out; see Table 13.
Adrastos, a son of Talaos and grandson of Bias,223 led the expedition of the
Seven and was accompanied on it by his brother Mekisteus, who was killed at
Thebes; Parthenopaios, another of the Seven, was sometimes classed as a further
brother of his (see p. 317). He also had a brother Pronax who met his death before
the war.224 After surviving the ﬁrst war with the aid of his divine horse Areion,
Adrastos marched against Thebes for a second time with the Epigonoi, although he
was now too old to ﬁght in battle. His only son Aigialeus and his nephew Euryalos,
the son of the above-mentioned Mekisteus, represented the Biantid family as leading
warriors on this occasion. Since Aigialeus was killed in battle (see p. 326) and his
grief-stricken father died shortly afterwards on the way home, Adrastos’ throne
passed through the female line to Diomedes after the war. Diomedes, who had also
marched with the Epigonoi, was the only son of Tydeus, a member of the Aetolian
royal family who had married a daughter of Adrastos after being exiled from his
native land (see p. 316). Tydeus was dead by this time, having been killed at Thebes
as one of the Seven. As a great warrior who had succeeded to Adrastos’ position as
overlord of the non-Pelopid lands of the Argolid, Diomedes commanded the men
of Argos, Tiryns and the eastern Argolid at the Trojan War. He was assisted by
two subordinate leaders, Euryalos, son of Mekisteus, from the junior branch of this
Biantid line, and Sthenelos, son of Kapaneus, from the old Argive ruling line.225
In Pausanias’ account of the legendary history of Argos, Adrastos is said to have had an heir
in the male line too, a grandson Kyanippos who was fathered by Aigialeus before his early
death. It is explained with some plausibility that he was too young to succeed to the throne
after the death of Adrastos or to ﬁght at Troy, and that his family was therefore represented
at Troy by Diomedes and Euryalos as in the epic tradition.226 Only in very late sources is
it suggested that he fought at Troy and entered the city as one of the warriors in the Wooden
Horse.227 His later career will be considered below.

— The mythical history of Thebes —
333

The old Argive royal line was represented among the Seven by Kapaneus, son
of Hipponoos, a descendant of Proitos in the third or fourth generation,228 and
Eteoklos, son of Iphis, a descendant of Proitos in the ﬁfth generation; see Table 5.
It will be noted that these genealogies are not properly synchronized with those of
the Biantids and Melampodids. Since Hipponoos, the father of Kapaneus, lived
abroad as king of Olenos in Achaea, Iphis, the father of Eteoklos and father-in-law
of Kapaneus, was the leading member of the Proitid line within the Argolid in the
period preceding the Theban wars. He was fated to suffer a triple bereavement as
a result of the ﬁrst war, since he was not only deprived of his son Eteoklos (who
was killed in the ﬁghting) and his son-in-law Kapaneus (who was struck by a thun-
derbolt, see p. 320), but also lost his daughter Euadne when she jumped on to the
funeral pyre of her husband Tydeus (see p. 322).229 The latter story ﬁrst appears in
Euripides’ Suppliants, in which Iphis vainly attempts to persuade her from following
that course, and laments afterwards that nothing but desolation awaits him in his
old age, for there will be no one left to greet him either in his own house or in
that of his son-in-law.230 Kapaneus left a son, Sthenelos, who marched against
Thebes as one of the Epigonoi, and inherited the throne of Iphis when that king
died at some stage before the Trojan War.
Diomedes was a hero of the very ﬁrst rank who was celebrated for the part that
he played in the Trojan War; see further on pp. 461ff. In contrast to Diomedes
himself, who is prominent in the earlier books of the Iliad, dominating the ﬁghting
while Achilles is absent from the battleﬁeld, EURYALOS appears on two occasions
only after being initially mentioned as a lieutenant of Diomedes, ﬁrst in a short
battle-scene in which he kills two minor Trojans, and second when he is ignomin-
iously defeated by Epeios in a boxing-match during the funeral games for Achilles.231
In Polygnotos’ mural of the sack of Troy, which would have been based on the epic
tradition for the most part, Euryalos was shown among the injured with wounds to
the head and wrist.232 This would suggest that he was thought to have returned
home alive; and his supposed grave could be seen correspondingly at Argos.233
STHENELOS, the other lieutenant of Diomedes, appears much more frequently
in the Iliad than Euryalos, but only in a supporting role as the charioteer and closest
comrade of Diomedes. The two had already fought at one another’s side as Epigonoi.
There is a memorable passage in the Iliad in which Agamemnon tries to spur on
Diomedes by accusing him of being a worse ﬁghter than his father, prompting
Sthenelos to reply on his behalf that this can hardly be true since the Epigonoi
captured Thebes, and with a lesser army too, after their fathers had perished in the
attempt.234 It was generally accepted that Sthenelos returned home to Argos after
the war (even if Lycophron states that he was buried at Kolophon in Asia Minor).235
According to a local tradition at Argos, he brought a notable trophy back to the
city, for he was awarded the efﬁgy of Zeus Herkeios that had stood in the court-
yard of Priam’s palace at Troy, and deposited it in the temple of Larisan Zeus on
the acropolis at Argos, where it could be seen by visitors in historical times.236
Although Diomedes also returned safely to Argos, and apparently continued to rule
there in the early tradition, it was commonly agreed from the Hellenistic period
onward that he was forced into exile on his arrival and settled in Italy; this came about
because his wife Aigialeia had been seduced by Kometes, a son of Sthenelos, who had
— The mythical history of Thebes —
334

then plotted to kill her husband (see further on p. 487). Since Diomedes apparently
had no children by Aigialeia, his family played no further part in the affairs of the
Argolid. As for Kometes and Aigialeia, nothing at all is recorded of their subsequent
life (as is by no means surprising, since the story of their love affair would simply
have been invented to provide an explanation for the exile of Diomedes). According
to Pausanias’ account of the local history, Sthenelos ruled after his return as king in
the Proitid line, while Kyanippos (a late-invented son of Aigialeus and grandson of
Adrastos, see p. 333) inherited the position that had been occupied by the Biantid
king Adrastos and his successor Diomedes. Sthenelos was succeeded by his son
Kylarabos (or Kylarabes, or Kylasabos), who also inherited the Biantid share of the
kingdom; Kyanippos died without an heir; and when Kylarabos himself died without
an heir, the kingdom passed to Orestes, son of Agamemnon, the Pelopid king of
Mycenae, and the whole of the Argolid was thus united under Pelopid rule.237 The
grave of Kylarabos could be seen along with that of his father Sthenelos at the
Kylarabis, a gymnasium in Argos that bore his name.238

LEGENDS OF CRETE 
AND ATHENS

MINOS, THESEUS AND THE MINOTAUR
O
f the three main branches of the Inachid family, only the smallest remains to
be considered, the branch that was established by Europa on Crete after she
was abducted to that island by Zeus. As was explained in Chapter 7, the early
Argive, Theban and Cretan royal lines were all descended from Io, an Argive princess
who settled in Egypt, through one or other of her two great-grandsons, Belos, king
of Egypt, or Agenor, king of Phoenicia (see pp. 231ff). Europa and her brother
Kadmos, the founder of the Theban royal line, were children of the latter. As we
saw at the beginning of the previous chapter, the abduction of Europa led to the
scattering of Agenor’s family since he sent his sons in search of her and they remained
abroad after failing to ﬁnd her. Unbeknown to them all, Zeus had taken her across
the sea to Crete, where he had fathered a family of sons by her. Her line in Crete
is much shorter than those of Kadmos in Thebes or Danaos in Argos (even if some
mythographers tried to remove the chronological inconsistency, see below), and it
is also of lesser signiﬁcance overall, although it includes a few ﬁgures of high note,
above all the great Minos.
As anyone who has even a passing acquaintance with the myth of the Minotaur
will be aware, the mythical history of Crete in the age of Minos was closely inter-
twined with that of Athens. Daidalos, an exile from Athens, helped Pasiphae to
conceive the Minotaur and built the labyrinth as a home for it; by sailing against
Athens during the reign of Aigeus, Minos forced the Athenians to send a regular
tribute of young people as food for the Minotaur; and Theseus, the son and heir of
Aigeus, eventually killed the Minotaur with the aid of advice from Daidalos, so
setting in course the train of events that would lead to the death of Minos himself.
In view of the important connections between Athens and Crete during the only
period of mythical history in which either place is truly prominent, it will be conve-
nient to consider the mythology of Athens along with that of Crete in the present
chapter, interweaving the story of Theseus with that of Minos and his family in the
ﬁrst part of the chapter. We will return to the Athenian royal family in the second
part, to trace the rest of its history from the beginning to its conclusion after the
Trojan War.
CHAPTER TEN
336

The genealogies of this Cretan branch of the Inachid family are not properly synchronized
with those of the Argive and Theban branches since Minos lived only two generations before
the Trojan War while Kadmos and Danaos lived at least seven generations before it. The
Cretans were commanded at Troy by Minos’ grandson Idomoneus; and correspondingly,
Theseus and his father Aigeus, the Athenian adversaries of Minos, belonged to the genera-
tions that lived immediately before the Trojan War. To remove the resulting chronological
inconsistencies, some mythographers tried to lengthen the Cretan line by claiming that the
Minos who was a son of Europa was the grandfather of the famous Minos through a son
called Lykastos (the eponym of a Cretan city of that name).1
Zeus abducts Europa to Crete and fathers three sons by her
In the earliest surviving account of the abduction of EUROPA, as ascribed to 
Hesiod (i.e. the author of the Catalogue) and Bacchylides, Zeus fell in love with her
when he saw her gathering ﬂowers with her attendant maidens in a meadow in
Phoenicia, and turned himself into a bull to carry her away. After beguiling her 
by breathing a crocus from his mouth, he took her on to his back and carried her
through the sea to Crete, where he reverted to his proper form and took her as his
mistress.2 Later authors have nothing essential to add even if they are able to provide
a variety of picturesque details. According to the Hellenistic poet Moschus, who
supplies the most elaborate account, the bull was yellow with a circle of white on
its forehead, and it emitted a divine fragrance that drowned out the scent of the
ﬂower-strewn meadow; and after winning Europa’s conﬁdence by its gentle and ﬂir-
tatious behaviour and its melodious lowings, it knelt down to entice her on to its
back. Or in the broadly similar account by Ovid, it was as white as the undriven
snow. Some authors followed the early Argive mythographer Acusilaus in regarding
it as an ordinary bull that was sent by Zeus or the gods; in that case, the Cretan
bull that was later captured by Herakles could be identiﬁed with it (see p. 261).3
Zeus fathered three important sons by Europa in her new homeland, Minos,
Rhadamanthys and Sarpedon. He gave her some marvellous gifts, a necklace from
the workshop of Hephaistos (sometimes identiﬁed with the necklace of Harmonia,
see p. 297), a huge man of bronze called Talos, who guarded the coasts of the island
until he was killed by Medeia (see p. 396), and an infallible hunting-dog and
hunting-spear (which were later taken to Attica by Prokris, see p. 372).4 When the
time came for him to take leave of her, he arranged for her to marry ASTERIOS
(or Asterion), king of Crete, who adopted her divinely begotten sons and fathered
no further children by her. According to Diodorus, this Asterios was a son of
Tektamos and grandson of Doros who had established himself as king of the island
after sailing over from Central Greece with some Aeolian and Pelasgian followers.5
Minos, Pasiphae and the origin of the Minotaur
After the death of their adoptive father MINOS and Sarpedon fought for the throne,
and Minos gained the upper hand, driving Sarpedon and his followers into exile.6 Or
in another account, the two brothers fell out with one another because both of them
fell in love with the same boy, Miletos, son of Apollo; and Minos was so angry when
Miletos showed a preference for Sarpedon that he expelled the two of them from the

island.7 The mythology of Sarpedon and Miletos will be considered in greater detail
later in the chapter (see pp. 349ff), as will the mythology of Rhadamanthys, the other
brother of Minos (see p. 351). We will concentrate for the present on the reign of
Minos and the story of the Minotaur.
Minos married PASIPHAE, a daughter of the sun-god Helios, who bore him four
sons, Katreus, Deukalion, Androgeos and Glaukos, and several daughters including
Ariadne and Phaidra.8 He also fathered various illegitimate children by local
nymphs, so angering Pasiphae by his many inﬁdelities that she ﬁnally put a spell
on him, causing him to ejaculate snakes, scorpions and millipedes whenever he slept
with another woman; but he was eventually cured of this inconvenient afﬂiction 
by another mistress, the Athenian heroine Prokris (see p. 372).9 For his unsuccessful
pursuit of the nymph Britomartis, see p. 191. In the political sphere, he was noted
for two things above all, his wisdom as a lawmaker and his power as the founder
of a great maritime empire. As the ﬁrst ruler to recognize the potentialities of sea-
power, he used his navy to extend his rule to most of the Aegean islands; Greek
authors of the classical and Hellenistic periods liked to imagine that his empire was
comparable to that of Athens in the age of Perikles.10 He was also regarded as the
framer of the Cretan constitution, which was highly admired in antiquity; in this
ﬁeld of his activity, he beneﬁted from the advice of Zeus, visiting his father at his
sacred cave on Mt Ida every nine years to consult him on his lawmaking.11 As has
already been mentioned (see p. 122), Minos was so famed for his justice on earth
that he was chosen to become one of the judges of the dead during his posthumous
life in Hades. There was a dissenting tradition, however, especially fostered at Athens
(a land oppressed by him in myth), that represented him as having been a brutal
tyrant. His name has been associated with the distinctive ‘Minoan’ civilization of
Crete ever since that name was attached to it by Sir Arthur Evans at the beginning
of the last century (but it is safer to put this out of one’s mind when considering
his ancient myths).
Most of the main legends of Minos were connected in one way or another with
the story of the MINOTAUR. This monster came to be born to his wife Pasiphae
in the following circumstances. To demonstrate to the Cretans that his claim to the
throne was approved by the gods, Minos prayed to Poseidon to send a bull up from
the sea, promising to sacriﬁce it to him on its arrival; but he was so impressed by
its beauty when it appeared that he mixed it into his own herds, substituting another
at the sacriﬁce. Or in a rather different version, he used to sacriﬁce the ﬁnest bull
that was born in his herds each year as an offering to Poseidon, but when a beast
of wholly exceptional beauty was born one year, he kept it for himself and sacri-
ﬁced another instead. In either case, Poseidon was so angry not to receive the proper
bull that he turned it wild and caused Pasiphae to conceive an unnatural passion
for it.12 Now it happened that DAIDALOS, the ﬁnest of all craftsmen, was in Crete
at the time after ﬂeeing his native Athens to escape prosecution for murder (see
below). So Pasiphae conﬁded her secret to him, and he enabled her to gratify her
desire by constructing a wooden cow with an ox-hide covering, and telling her to
crouch down inside it in the presence of the bull. As the product of her intercourse
with the bull, she gave birth to a monster with the head and tail of a bull and the
body of a man.13 It was usually known as the Minotaur (Minotauros, i.e. bull of
— Legends of Crete and Athens —
338

Minos), although some mythographers report that it was properly named Asterios
or Asterion after Minos’ adoptive father.14 At the request of Minos, Daidalos
constructed a huge covered maze, the Labyrinth, to serve as its home and prison.15
Daidalos had left Athens because he had murdered his nephew. For he had taken his nephew
Talos (or Kalos, or Perdix) as his apprentice, but had grown increasingly jealous when the
youth turned out to be so ingenious that he had threatened to overshadow his master. For
Talos proceeded to invent all kinds of wonderful devices including the potter’s wheel and
an instrument for inscribing circles; and when he happened to see a snake’s jawbone with

its neat row of jagged teeth (or else the backbone of a ﬁsh), he was inspired to invent the
ﬁrst saw. This last feat overstrained the jealousy of Daidalos, who murdered him by hurling
him down from the Acropolis. When his corpse was discovered on the ground below,
Daidalos was arraigned for murder at the court of the Areiopagos (see p. 366); but he escaped
the inevitable penalty by stealing away to Crete.16 The mythographers contrived a royal
pedigree for Daidalos by ﬁtting him into the royal family as a grandson or great-grandson
of Erechtheus, king of Athens, through his father Eupalamos or Metion.17
Minos attacks Athens and Megara, and forces the Athenians to
send consignments of young people as food for the Minotaur
The Minotaur was fed on youths and maidens who were sent over from Athens at
regular intervals ever since the Athenians were ﬁrst obliged to compensate Minos 
for the death of his son ANDROGEOS. As one of the ﬁnest athletes of the age,
Androgeos had travelled to Athens to compete in the Panathenaic Games and had
met his death afterwards in disputed circumstances. It was commonly agreed that he
aroused resentment by carrying off the victory in every event; and in one account, his
jealous rivals ambushed and killed him as he was setting off for Thebes to compete
in the funeral games for Laios.18 Or else Aigeus, the king of Athens, sent him out to
confront the ferocious bull of Marathon (see p. 344) for reasons of state, because 
he feared that the young Cretan was conspiring with some enemies of his, the sons 
of Pallas (see pp. 356–7).19 When Minos heard of his son’s fate, he made immediate
preparations for a war against Athens. The news was brought to him as he was
offering a sacriﬁce to the Charites (Graces) on Paros; since he stopped the ﬂute-music
and threw the garland from his head but went on to complete the sacriﬁce, such sacri-
ﬁces were performed on the island without ﬂutes or garlands ever afterwards.20
Before launching his main attack against Athens, Minos laid siege to neighbouring
Megara. The city had close connections with Athens at that time because it was
under the rule of NISOS, son of Pandion, a brother of the king of Athens; and some
sources claim that Minos had special cause for hostility because Megarian athletes
had joined together with Athenians to murder his son.21 Nisos proved to be a
troublesome opponent because he had a purple hair (or lock of hair) on his head
which rendered him invulnerable or guaranteed the safety of his city as long as it
remained in place; but the problem was resolved when his daughter SKYLLA fell
in love with Minos after catching sight of him from the ramparts, and pulled the
magical hair from her father’s head while he was asleep.22 Or according to Aeschylus,
Minos bribed her to take this action by offering her necklaces of Cretan gold.23 If
she had hoped to win the love of Minos by helping him to capture the city, she
was soon undeceived, for he was so appalled by her unﬁlial act of treachery that he
tied her to the stern of his ship and dragged her through the sea until she drowned;
or else he ordered that she should be thrown from his ship, and she was washed
ashore on Cape Skyllaia in the Argolid.24
The legend of Skylla became very popular in Hellenistic and Roman times, and many
different accounts are preserved of the story of her death. Most authors agree that she was
transformed into a mythical bird, the kiris (or ciris in Latin form); and it could be explained
that this was an appropriate form for her because she had ‘cut off’ (keiro¯ in Greek) her father’s
— Legends of Crete and Athens —
340

magical hair. In Parthenius’ Hellenistic version, she was turned into this mysterious bird as
she was being dragged through the sea behind Minos’ ship.25 Subsequent accounts often add
that she was persecuted in her new life by her father, who was transformed into a ﬁerce sea-
eagle.26 In Ovid’s version, in which Minos simply abandoned her rather than towing her
behind his ship, she leapt into the sea and clung to his departing ship, but let go in terror
when she saw her father hovering above in eagle-form, and turned into a ciris as she fell.27
A long and elaborate narrative combining material from different versions may be found in
the pseudo-Vergilian Ciris. Hyginus departs from the usual pattern by stating that Skylla
was transformed into a ﬁsh called the ciris, which is attacked with great savagery by the sea-
eagle;28 since there is mention in Greek literature of a ﬁsh called the kiris,29 it would seem
that this is a genuine variant (as opposed to an error, as is common enough in Hyginus).
For another tale in which a maiden came to a bad end after removing a magical hair from
the head of her father, see p. 247.
Athens was able to offer more effective resistance, and the war dragged on until
Minos eventually lost patience and prayed for the assistance of his father Zeus, who
responded by afﬂicting the Athenians with a famine and a plague. After attempting
to free themselves from their troubles by means of human sacriﬁces (see further on
p. 370), the Athenians consulted the Delphic oracle, which advised them to compen-
sate Minos by offering him whatever reparation he might demand. As the terms of
the resulting settlement, Minos ordered that they should send seven youths and
seven maidens to Crete every nine years (or every year) to serve as food for the
Minotaur for as long as the monster should live.30
This tribute continued to be sent until Theseus, the son and successor of Aigeus,
was sent as one of the youths in the tribute and killed the Minotaur in its lair.
Before following the story to its conclusion and considering how the triumph of
Theseus became the indirect cause of the death of Minos, we must examine the
origins and earlier life of this greatest of Athenian heroes.
The birth of Theseus and his adventures on the road to Athens
Although AIGEUS, king of Athens, married twice over after ascending to the throne,
taking Meta, daughter of Hoples, as his ﬁrst wife, and Chalkiope, daughter of
Rhexenor, as his second, he failed to father any children by either marriage and
came to feel increasingly vulnerable without an heir to support and succeed him.
When he consulted the Delphic oracle about the matter, he received an enigmatic
response advising him ‘not to untie the mouth of the wineskin until he arrived at
the heights of Athens’. In terms of some fairly obvious symbolism, this meant that
he should not have intercourse with any woman until he reached his wife in Athens,
evidently because this would result in the conception of a son. Aigeus was mysti-
ﬁed, however, and travelled out of his way during his return journey to seek the
advice of PITTHEUS, son of Pelops, the king of Troizen, who was renowned for
his wisdom. Although Pittheus recognized the meaning of the oracle at once, he
kept it to himself because he wanted to ensure that his daughter AITHRA would
bear the child to Aigeus (for the ﬁrst and perhaps only son of the king of Athens
would surely be destined for a glorious future). So he plied his guest with wine at
a banquet on the evening of his arrival, and then introduced Aithra into his bed.

When Aigeus woke up on the following morning and realized what he had done,
he told Aithra that she should bring up their son if she should bear one, but keep
his origin a secret. He then placed a sword and some sandals under a large rock
nearby, and instructed Aithra to take their son to the rock when he grew up, saying
that if he were able to roll it aside, he should recover the hidden objects and take
them to Athens as tokens of his identity.31
So runs the common story, but there was also a tradition that claimed that Theseus was really
a son of Poseidon. According to the local legend at Troizen Athena sent a dream to Aithra
one night ordering her to cross over to the little island of Sphairia just off the coast to pour a
libation to Sphairos (a former chariot-driver of Pelops who was buried on the island); and
while she was there, Poseidon caught her by surprise and had intercourse with her, causing
her to conceive Theseus. As a result of this incident, she founded a shrine on the island to
Athene Apatouria (Deceitful Athene) and changed its name to Hiera (Holy Island).32 To
reconcile the conﬂicting traditions about Theseus’ birth, some mythographers suggested that
Aithra slept with Aigeus and Poseidon on the same night.33
Aithra duly gave birth to a son who was brought up at the Troizenian court under
the name of THESEUS. Only a single story is recorded of his childhood in Troizen.
Herakles called in one day and left his lionskin on the ground while he was dining
with Pittheus; and when Theseus (who was now seven) and his young friends caught
sight of the skin, they all ran away in terror with the sole exception of Theseus,
who seized an axe and attacked it in the belief that it was a living lion.34 When
he came of age, he rolled the rock aside with ease to recover his father’s tokens, and
made preparations for his journey to Athens. Since Troizen lay on the eastern coast
of the Argolid, facing Athens from the opposite side of the Saronic Gulf, he could
either travel by a direct sea-route or else follow the coastal path that led northwards
round to Isthmus of Corinth. He opted for the longer land-route in the face of every
warning because it provided more prospect for adventure.35 His expectations were
more than fulﬁlled, for he was waylaid by a succession of colourful villains and estab-
lished his heroic credentials by performing a cycle of ﬁve or six exploits.36
The earliest literary reference to this cycle of heroic deeds is to be found in an ode of
Bacchylides written in the ﬁrst half of the ﬁfth century BC, which lists all of the deeds
described below except for the ﬁrst, his slaying of the Club-man Periphetes at Epidaurus.37
The cycle is regularly portrayed on Attic vases; the artistic evidence indicates that it must
have been familiar (without the Club-man as yet) by the ﬁnal decade of the sixth century, after
having presumably been established in an epic poem composed in the latter part of that
century. Although Diodorus is the ﬁrst author to refer explicitly to Theseus’ confrontation
with the Club-man, Euripides already mentions that Theseus used a club from Epidaurus,
which would imply that the tragedian knew of the episode;38 and the visual record conﬁrms
that the story was probably in circulation by the ﬁfth century.
On reaching Epidaurus further up the eastern coast of the Argolid, Theseus was
confronted by Periphetes, otherwise known as Korynetes (the Club-man), who
carried a bronze or iron club because he was weak on his feet, and used it to cudgel
passing strangers to death. He is often described as a son of Hephaistos, evidently
because of his lameness. When assaulted by this brute, Theseus wrested the club
— Legends of Crete and Athens —
342

from his grip and killed him with it. The ancient mythographers state that Theseus
adopted the club for his own use (although it is not really a special attribute of his
in the same way as the club of Herakles).39
When Theseus reached the Isthmus of Corinth, he was confronted by Sinis, other-
wise known as Pityokamptes (the Pine-bender), a savage son of Poseidon (or
Polypemon) who made use of pine-trees to cause the death of travellers. In one
version, he would bend two pine-trees to the ground, fasten his victim to them,
and then let go of them, causing his victim to be torn in half as the trees sprung
upwards.40 Or in another version, he would compel his victim to help him to bend
a single pine-tree to the ground and then suddenly let go, causing the unfortunate
traveller to be tossed into the air and killed.41 Theseus turned his own method
against him, causing him to be killed as he had formerly killed others. His daughter
Perigune hid herself in a bed of wild asparagus, but Theseus sought her out and
seduced her, fathering a son Melanippos (a minor Attic hero who had a shrine at
Athens).42
As Theseus was proceeding up the Isthmus, he killed the sow of Krommyon,
a ferocious beast that had long been a menace to travellers. It was named Phaia (the
Grey) after the old woman who had reared it. In vase-paintings, Theseus is usually
shown confronting the beast with his sword as the old woman (who is named only
once, as Kromyo) urges it forward with her outstretched arm or arms.
At the Skeironian Cliffs in Megara, the province adjoining Attica to the west,
Theseus encountered Skeiron, a villain who forced passers-by to wash his feet and
kicked them over the cliffs as they were doing so, propelling them into the sea
below to fall prey to a giant turtle. Theseus bent down as if in obedience to his
command, but seized him by his feet and hurled him into the sea, where he was
eaten by the turtle.
The Megarians refused to accept that Skeiron was a rogue of such a kind. According to the
local tradition as recorded by Pausanias, he was of royal descent as a great-grandson of the
primordial king Lelex, and he married the daughter of Pandion (an exiled king of Athens 
who came to rule at Megara, see p. 374). After the death of Pandion, he quarrelled over the
succession with Nisos, a son of the dead king, and the matter was referred for arbitration to
Aiakos (the righteous king of Aegina, see p. 531). Aiakos decided that Nisos should become
king of Megara and Skeiron its polemarch (military commander).43 While acting in this func-
tion, Skeiron not only suppressed brigandage but constructed the main thoroughfare through
the Isthmus, the Skeironian Way, which led through the rough countryside to the south-west
of the city of Megara; Herodotus remarks that when the Greeks set out to fortify the Isthmus
against the Persians, the ﬁrst action that they undertook was to block this path.44 The
Megarians claimed that the wife of Aiakos, who was called Endeis, was a daughter of Skeiron
(rather than of Cheiron as in the original tradition), and argued that the pious Aiakos would
hardly have agreed to the alliance if Skeiron had really been such a villain as the other Greeks
pretended. Although they were willing to accept that he had been killed by Theseus, they
claimed that he had met his death in honourable circumstances when Theseus, as king of
Athens, was seizing Eleusis from the Megarians who then controlled it.45
As Theseus was passing through Attica, he was confronted by Kerkyon, king of
Eleusis, a son of Poseidon (or Hephaistos, or Branchos), who used to force passing

strangers to wrestle with him and killed them in the ring. But the young hero
killed him in his turn by raising him up into the air and dashing him to the ground.
Kerkyon’s wrestling-ground could be seen in historical times beside the road that
led from Megara to Eleusis. As this story might suggest, Theseus was reputed to
have been a very ﬁne wrestler or even the man who had ﬁrst established wrestling
as an art rather than an exercise in brute strength.46
This Eleusinian Kerkyon was sometimes identiﬁed with Kerkyon, son of Agamedes, an
Arcadian from Stymphalos; for the circumstances of his arrival in that case, see p. 559.
Kerkyon had a daughter ALOPE who bore HIPPOTHOON, the eponym of one of the
Kleisthenian tribes of Athens, to Poseidon.47 She gave her new-born child to her nurse to
be exposed, but it was suckled by a mare and rescued by a shepherd. When a fellow shep-
herd asked to rear the child, the man who had found it passed it on to him but kept the
ﬁne clothing in which it had been wrapped. A quarrel arose as a consequence since the
second shepherd wanted the clothes as proof that the child had been free-born, and the two
of them referred the matter to the king for arbitration. On seeing the royal garments,
Kerkyon forced the truth out of Alope’s nurse, and ordered that his daughter should be
killed and the child exposed once again. It was suckled by a mare, however, as on the ﬁrst
occasion and then discovered by the shepherds, who suspected that the child must be under
divine protection; and Alope for her part was transformed by Poseidon into the spring of
that name near Eleusis. After Kerkyon was killed by Theseus, Hippothoon (who was grown
up by now) asked to inherit his grandfather’s kingdom, and Theseus was happy to grant his
request on learning that he was a son of Poseidon like himself.48
At Erineos, no great distance from Athens, Theseus encountered the villain who is
commemorated in proverb for his ‘Procrustean bed’. The Greeks knew him vari-
ously as Prokroustes (Hammerer), Damastes and Polypemon. He owned a house
by the roadside that contained two special beds, one short and the other long, and
he used to lure travellers to their destruction by inviting them to enjoy his 
hospitality. For if they were short, he would demonstrate his hospitality by laying
them on the long bed and hammering out their legs until they ﬁtted it; or if they
were tall, he would lay them on the short bed and cut off the parts of their body
that projected beyond it. Or in another version of the story, he had a single bed
and would adapt his visitors to ﬁt it by pruning their bodies or hammering them
out as the occasion demanded.49 Theseus meted out the same treatment to him and
reached Athens without further incident.
Theseus is acknowledged as heir to the Athenian throne, 
and sets off for Crete with the tribute
Theseus was faced with perils of a more insidious nature on his arrival, for Medeia
had married Aigeus after parting from Jason and had borne him a son Medos (see 
p. 400) and was prepared to plot the death of Theseus to protect her position and the
prospects of her son. Realizing who he was before he was able to prove his identity
to his father, she persuaded Aigeus that the newly arrived stranger was conspiring to
seize the throne; and the king reacted by sending him to confront the savage bull 
of Marathon (usually identiﬁed with the Cretan bull that had been sent mad by
— Legends of Crete and Athens —
344

Poseidon, see p. 338, and had later been brought to the mainland by Herakles, see 
p. 261). After travelling to its haunts in north-eastern Attica, Theseus subdued it to
his will without suffering any harm and drove it to back to Athens, where he or the
king offered it in sacriﬁce to Apollo. Theseus was said to have stayed with an old
woman called Hekale while performing this exploit. Medeia adopted a new plan after
this setback, by mixing a poisoned draught and arranging that Aigeus should serve
it to Theseus at a banquet; but Aigeus noticed at the very last moment that the young
man was wearing the sword that he had placed under the rock at Troizen, and
knocked the wine-cup out of his hands to prevent the poison from reaching his lips.
Medeia’s schemes were thus exposed, and Aigeus (or Theseus) drove her out of the
kingdom along with her son (see further on p. 400). Theseus for his part received
public acknowledgement from his father and was recognized thenceforth as the legit-
imate heir to the throne. There was a version of this legend in which the attempted
poisoning was Medeia’s only scheme, and Theseus set out against the bull of his own
accord to court the favour of the Athenians.50
While Theseus was travelling across Attica to confront the bull, he was caught by a storm
and was granted shelter and hospitality by an old woman called HEKALE, who lived in the
deme (parish) of that name between Athens and Marathon. As he was setting out on the
following morning, she vowed to offer a sacriﬁce to Zeus if he returned safely from his
encounter with the bull. He discovered on his return, however, that she had died in the
meantime, and he acknowledged her kindness by ordering that she should be honoured at
the annual local festival of Zeus Hekaleios. She was also called Hekaline in that connection,
supposedly because Theseus had addressed her by this pet name during his stay. This aeti-
ological legend was recounted at some length by Callimachus in a miniature epic, the Hekale,
which is preserved only in fragmentary form.51
When the third tribute of youths and maidens was due to be sent to Crete as food
for the Minotaur, Theseus volunteered to be included in it in the hope that he
would be able kill the monster and so relieve Athens from the tribute; or else he
was simply chosen by lot along with the other young people.52 Or in yet another
version, Minos used to sail to Athens to pick out the victims himself, and he selected
Theseus as his ﬁrst choice on the present occasion.53 In connection with the usual
story in which the tribute was conveyed in an Athenian ship, it was said that it
was ﬁtted with black sails on account of its gloomy mission, and that Aigeus ordered
Theseus to raise white sails as a sign of his safe return if he should come back
unscathed.54
A memorable story of fairly ancient origin is recounted in connection with
Theseus’ voyage to Crete; it presupposes that Minos sailed to Athens to collect the
tribute, and that Theseus was a son of Poseidon as in the Troizenian tradition (see
p. 342). When Minos, who was noted for his amorous disposition, took a fancy to
one of the girls in the tribute (a certain Eriboia) and began to caress her cheeks,
Theseus ordered him to desist; and to justify this intervention against a son of 
Zeus, he proclaimed that he too was of semi-divine origin as a son of Poseidon, the
great god of the seas. After ﬁrst praying to Zeus to send a lightning-bolt as proof
of his own birth, Minos removed a golden ring from his ﬁnger and hurled it into
the sea, challenging Theseus to fetch it back again if he was really a son of Poseidon.

So Theseus jumped from the stern of the ship, trusting in his father to ensure his
safety. Some dolphins swam up to him and carried him down to his father’s palace
in the depths of the sea, where Amphitrite, the consort of Poseidon, presented him
with a purple robe and a golden crown that she had received from Aphrodite on
the day of her wedding (and presumably also ensured that he gained possession of
the ring of Minos, even though this is not explicitly stated in our source).55
Or in another account, Thetis gave him a crown while the Nereids brought him
the ring.56 Poseidon can be seen receiving him in person in some Attic vase-
paintings. When he rose up from the sea with the divine gifts and the ring, Minos
was put to shame and the young Athenians rejoiced.
Theseus kills the Minotaur with help from Ariadne, but abandons 
her during the return voyage
After his arrival in Crete, Theseus received invaluable assistance from one of the
king’s daughters, ARIADNE, who fell in love with him and consulted the builder
of the labyrinth on his behalf. Daidalos told her that Theseus would be able to ﬁnd
his way out again if he attached the end of a ball of thread to the door as he entered
the maze, unwound the thread as he advanced through the passageways, and rewound
it to trace his way back after his confrontation with the Minotaur. So she brought
this advice and the necessary ball of thread to Theseus, who promised to repay her
by taking her back to Athens as his wife.57 Or in a less familiar version, she already

possessed an object that could ensure his salvation, for Dionysos had previously
seduced her by giving her a wonderful jewelled crown made by Hephaistos that
shone in the dark; so she gave this crown to her prospective husband, who used it
to light his way through the murk of the labyrinth.58
On encountering the Minotaur at the heart of the labyrinth, Theseus confronted
and killed it, with a sword in most accounts. Vase-painters give freer rein to their
imagination, however, and also show him attacking the monster with a spear, or
club, or stone, or even his bare ﬁsts. After escaping from the maze by use of the
ball of thread (or the crown), he hurried down to the harbour with Ariadne and the
young Athenians from the tribute, and knocked holes into the bottoms of the Cretan
ships to prevent any danger of pursuit before sailing off into the night.59
During the voyage north, Theseus called in at the island of Naxos (or Dia), where
he abandoned Ariadne. An early tradition suggested that he did so deliberately
because he was in love with another woman, namely Aigle, a daughter of the Phocian
hero Panopeus;60 but it was commonly agreed in the later tradition that he was
obliged to leave Ariadne behind because Dionysos wanted her as his wife. Athena
appeared to him for that reason while he was asleep on the shore and ordered him

to sail home without Ariadne; or else Hermes ordered him to do so;61 or Dionysos
simply carried the girl away while he was lying asleep.62 She met with a happy fate
in any case since Dionysos not only made her his consort but also proved to be a
devoted and more or less faithful husband (see p. 179). The Odyssey offers an excep-
tional version of Ariadne’s story in which Artemis shot her on Dia in response to
evidence laid against her by Dionysos;63 the story that lay behind this brief and
surprising report seems to have been forgotten at an early period.
After calling in at Delos, where the youths from the tribute ﬁrst performed the
crane-dance, a serpentine dance that imitated the windings of the labyrinth,64
Theseus and his companions ﬁnally arrived within sight of Attica. In the exultation
of the moment or because he was still grieving over the loss of Ariadne, Theseus
forgot to raise white sails on the ship to show his father that he was safe; and when
Aigeus saw the black sails from his vantage-point on the Acropolis or Cape Sounion
at the southern tip of Attica, he hurled himself down to his death. Some claimed
that the Aegean Sea was named after him because he threw himself into it on this
occasion. After landing at Phaleron, the old harbour of Athens, Theseus became
aware of the tragic consequence of his oversight and ascended to the city in mourning
rather than in triumph, as the new king of Athens.65 We will consider the course
of his reign after ﬁrst completing our survey of Cretan myth.
The ﬂight of Daidalos and Ikaros, and death of Minos
On discovering that Daidalos had provided invaluable advice to Theseus, Minos
ordered that he should be arrested and imprisoned in the labyrinth along with his
son IKAROS, who had been borne to him by a slave-girl in the palace. Or in another
account, Minos took this action after discovering (rather belatedly it would seem)
that Daidalos had enabled Pasiphae to conceive the Minotaur by building the wooden
cow for her. Daidalos was far too clever to submit to incarceration without devising
a means of escape, and set to work to make pairs of wings for himself and his son,
constructing them from bird’s feathers and wax. Before ﬂying off, he warned his
son not to soar too high, for the wax would then be melted by the sun, nor to
descend too low, for the wings would then be damaged by moisture from the sea;
but Ikaros was so exhilarated by the ﬂight that he soared higher and higher until
his wings eventually melted and he plunged to his death in the sea below. He fell
into the south-eastern region of the Aegean that was known as the Ikarian Sea ever
afterwards. Herakles, who was serving Omphale in Asia Minor at the time, found
his body on an island off the coast and buried him there, naming the island Ikaria
in his memory. Or else his father saw to his burial. Daidalos ﬂew with greater
prudence and made his way safely to Sicily, where he was offered refuge by Kokalos,
the king of Kamikos in the west of the island.66
After learning that Daidalos had escaped, Minos set out to track him down and
travelled far and wide in the course of his search. Wherever he went, he would
produce a spiral seashell and promise a handsome reward to anyone who could draw
a thread through it; for he was convinced that no one other than Daidalos had the
ingenuity to perform such a delicate feat. When he eventually arrived at Kamikos
and made his usual challenge, Kokalos took the shell from him and secretly gave
— Legends of Crete and Athens —
348

it to Daidalos, who was keeping out of sight; and Daidalos achieved the feat just
as Minos had supposed he would, by boring a small hole at the top of the shell,
attaching a thread to an ant, and causing the ant to crawl through the shell until
it emerged at the mouth. On receiving the shell with the thread drawn through it,
Minos realized that Daidalos was somewhere close by, and demanded that he should
be surrendered to him. Kokalos assured him that this would be done and invited
him to enjoy his hospitality in the meantime; but while Minos was taking his bath,
the king’s daughters caused his death by pouring boiling water (or molten pitch)
over him. Some said that Daidalos arranged the murder by ﬁtting a special pipe
into the ceiling above the bath.67
THE BROTHERS AND DESCENDANTS OF MINOS
Sarpedon and Miletos in Asia Minor
Before passing on to the children and descendants of Minos, we must consider the
myths of his two brothers, Sarpedon and Rhadamanthys. As has been brieﬂy
mentioned, SARPEDON quarrelled with his brother over the succession (or a love
affair) soon after the death of their adoptive father Asterion, and was driven into exile
on the Asian mainland. After coming ashore there, he established himself as the king
of Lycia, the westernmost province on the southern coast of Asia Minor.
Lycia was of more importance in Greek myth than one might suppose, partly
because the Lycians commanded by Sarpedon and Glaukos are presented in the Iliad
as the most signiﬁcant foreign allies of the Trojans, and partly because a king of the
land, Iobates, plays a central part in the interrelated legends of Proitos, king of Argos
(see p. 237), and the Corinthian hero Bellerophon (see p. 433). In the Iliad, as opposed
to the standard later tradition, the Sarpedon who fought at Troy is neither a brother
of Minos nor even of Cretan descent, but a son of Zeus by Laodameia, the daughter
of Bellerophon68 (who had married a Lycian princess after surviving various ordeals
that had been set for him by her father Iobates); and correspondingly, when Homer
has occasion to refer to the love affair between Europa and Zeus elsewhere in the
poem, he names Minos and Rhadamanthys alone as the offspring of their liaison.69
In the sixth book of the epic, Diomedes encounters Glaukos, the cousin of Sarpedon,
in battle, and is so impressed by his valour that he enquires about his ancestry,
prompting him to give a full account of his family history, from which we can 
reconstruct a family tree for the descendants of Bellerophon as shown in Table 4.
Glaukos mentions70 that his uncle Isandros had been killed by Ares as he was ﬁghting
against the Solymoi (a ﬁerce neighbouring people who had previously been worsted by
Bellerophon, see p. 434) and that his aunt Laodameia had been killed in anger by Artemis
for some unexplained reason. After listening to Glaukos, Diomedes tells him that their two
families are bound by ties of friendship because his grandfather Oineus had once entertained
Bellerophon at his palace in Aetolia, and he therefore proposes that the two of them should
not merely refrain from ﬁghting one another but should exchange their armour as a 
token of friendship.71 Since Diomedes was wearing ordinary bronze armour and Glaukos

magniﬁcent golden armour which was worth a hundred oxen, Homer is moved to remark
that Zeus must have robbed Glaukos of his wits, and a phrase from this passage, ‘gold for
bronze’, was adopted as a favourite proverb for an unequal bargain.72
The Homeric account of Sarpedon’s origins is displaced in the later tradition by 
the familiar account that makes him a son of Zeus and Europa from Crete. This
genealogy ﬁrst appears in the Hesiodic Catalogue and Herodotus’ Histories.73 It by no
means clear why such a change should have been regarded as desirable (although it
has been suggested that the new genealogy may have been introduced to provide
Sarpedon with a more favourable ancestry, since Sisyphos was a notorious rogue 
and his descendants tended to come to a bad end). Cretans ﬁgure regularly in foun-
dation myths for places in Asia Minor in any case, since the Cretans were thought to
be a very ancient people and their island was appropriately situated in relation to
Asia. Chronological difﬁculties are raised, however, if Homer’s Sarpedon is classed as
a son of Minos, since this would mean that he must have been born two generations
before the Trojan War (see p. 337). The Hesiodic Catalogue resolved the problem by
suggesting that Zeus granted him the exceptional privilege of living for longer than
an ordinary mortal (probably for three generations, as stated by Apollodorus,
although there is a gap in the Hesiodic fragment at the relevant point).74 Some later
authors preferred to reconcile this later genealogy with the Homeric one by positing
that there were two Sarpedons, the one who was born to Europa in Crete and a
grandson of the same name who commanded the Lycians at Troy; in that case, the
Cretan Sarpedon fathered a son in Lycia called Euandros, who married Deidameia,
daughter of Bellerophon, and fathered the Homeric Sarpedon by her.75
Although the surviving fragments of the Hesiodic Catalogue fail to explain why
Sarpedon should have left his native Crete, Herodotus explains his departure by a
power-struggle in which he was expelled by the victorious Minos. According to
Herodotus, the followers of Sarpedon who helped him to establish himself in Asia
Minor were known as the Termiloi (apparently a name that the Lycians applied to
themselves), but the people of the kingdom subsequently came to call themselves
Lycians when Lykos, a son of Pandion II, king of Athens, arrived to live among
them after being driven from Attica by his brother Aigeus (see p. 374).76 In a later
account of Sarpedon’s expulsion, as has been mentioned, he is said to have quar-
relled with Minos over the love of a boy called MILETOS. As the story is recounted
by Apollodorus, this boy was a son of Apollo by a certain Areia, daughter of
Kleochos, and Minos expelled him along with Sarpedon out of jealousy because 
he preferred the latter; Miletos founded the city of Miletos in Caria after his arrival
in Asia Minor, while Sarpedon won a kingdom for himself further to the south in
Lycia by joining with Kilix (the eponym of Cilicia, see p. 294) in a war against the
Lycians.77 This story was apparently of relatively late origin since Miletos was not
founded by a Miletos from Crete in the earliest surviving foundation-myth, as
recorded by Ephorus (a historian of the fourth century BC), but rather by Sarpedon
himself, who named the new city after the city of Miletos in Crete.78
A Miletos is ﬁrst named as the eponymous founder of Miletos in a tale ascribed to Aristikritos,
a Milesian author who probably lived in the third century BC. Areia, daughter of Kleochos,
— Legends of Crete and Athens —
350

bore Miletos to Apollo in Crete as in Apollodorus’ account, and hid him in a yew-tree (milax)
after his birth; but he was recovered by his grandfather Kleochos, who named him Miletos
after his hiding-place. The surviving report is vague about the circumstances of his exile,
merely stating that he was obliged to go abroad because he aroused the resentment of Minos;
the story may well have followed the same course as in Apollodorus’ version (or else Minos
suspected that Miletos was plotting against him as in an account by Ovid, who describes
Miletos as a son of Apollo by a certain Deione). He travelled ﬁrst to the island of Samos, where
he founded the Samian Miletos, and then to the Asian mainland, where he founded the far
greater Carian Miletos.79 In a somewhat later account ascribed to Nicander (second century),
Miletos becomes a member of the Cretan royal family; he was borne to Apollo as usual, by
Akakallis, daughter of Minos, who exposed him in the woods for fear of her father’s anger. He
was suckled by some she-wolves, however, at the will of Apollo, until he was recovered and
reared by some herdsmen (see also on p. 597). When he grew up to become a handsome young
man, Minos conceived a passion for him and planned to force him to his will, but he set off
by night for Caria on the advice of Sarpedon, and founded the city of Miletos.80
Miletos married a local woman who bore him two children, a son KAUNOS, who was
the eponym of the city of that name in southern Caria, and a daughter BYBLIS, who was
associated with a Milesian spring called the Tears of Byblis. The pair became famous in the
later tradition for the story of Byblis’ incestuous love for her brother. In one account, she
ﬁnally confessed her love to him and made advances to him, causing him such a shock that
he left Miletos forever and founded the city of Kaunos as his new home. Finding that she
was unable to quell her passion for her absent brother, Byblis hanged herself, and a spring
arose afterwards from her tears.81 Or in a rather different version, she tried to conceal her
passion, but it proved too much for her, and she tried to commit suicide by hurling herself
from a neighbouring mountain; but the local nymphs took pity on her and transformed her
into a hamadryad nymph (see p. 210), and she lived among them thereafter as their friend
and companion. The name of the spring is mentioned here, but it is not stated that it was
formed from her tears.82 In Ovid’s version, which is exceptional in suggesting that she was
actually transformed into the spring, she went mad with grief when her advances were
rejected by her brother, and wandered through the surrounding lands in a state of distrac-
tion until she ﬁnally lay down in exhaustion and wept without cease, dissolving into her
own tears to form a spring.83
Rhadamanthys, brother of Minos
RHADAMANTHYS, the other brother of Minos (or his only brother in earliest
tradition), remained with him in Crete, unlike Sarpedon, for some years at least.
He was no less renowned than Minos himself for his justice and his wisdom as a
lawmaker, and was said to have established the principle that a person who inﬂicts
a wrong should be repaid in exact proportion (ius talionis).84 As we have already
seen (see p. 250), the young Herakles saved himself from a charge of murder by
appealing to another law of his that justiﬁed retaliation against violence initiated
by another. Since he was credited with similar activities as a lawmaker and judge
to those of his brother, the mythographers tried to distinguish their spheres of
activity in various ways. According to some accounts, Minos reigned as king and
established the laws and constitution of Crete while Rhadamanthys served under
him as a judge and as guardian of the principles that were laid down by him.85 Or
else Minos ruled and legislated in Crete while Rhadamanthys performed a corres-
ponding function in the smaller islands to the north and some coastal districts of

Asia Minor. It was explained in that case that the islanders had been so impressed
by his reputation for justice that they had delivered themselves into his hands of
their own free will;86 or else Minos had grown so jealous of his fame that he had
tried to marginalize him by sending him to rule the remoter parts of his empire.87
Rhadamanthys also had Boeotian connections, for he was said to have left Crete
at some stage to marry Alkmene, the mother of Herakles, after the death of her
ﬁrst husband Amphitryon. The couple were supposed to have lived at Okaleia in
western Boeotia. Some claimed that Rhadamanthys instructed the young Herakles
in archery or even brought him up (although Amphitryon was generally thought
to have survived until Herakles was grown up). Since Apollodorus indicates that he
ﬂed to his new homeland as an exile, there must presumably have been some story
that explained the reason for his ﬂight, but the surviving literature is not helpful
on the matter (even if one source suggests that he ﬂed after killing a brother of his,
in accordance with a standard motif).88
An alternative tradition stated that Rhadamanthys married Alkmene posthumously in the
Isles of the Blessed (a home for the privileged dead, see p. 116); for when she died of old age
at Thebes, Zeus ordered Hermes to steal her from her cofﬁn and carry her across the sea to the
Isles to become the bride of Rhadamanthys (who was evidently already there). Hermes substi-
tuted a stone for her in her cofﬁn, which became so heavy as a consequence that her sons found
it too heavy to carry on her funeral-day and opened it up. On discovering the mysterious stone,
they set it up in a sacred grove at Thebes, near the site of Alkmene’s heroic shrine. Although
recounted as part of a narrative ascribed to Pherecydes, one may suspect that this aetiological
tale was of Hellenistic origin.89 The tradition of the posthumous marriage may be quite
ancient however. The story of the petrifaction of Alkmene’s corpse could be cited to explain
why she had no grave at Thebes.90
The Odyssey alludes to a tale in which the Phaeacians conveyed Rhadamanthys across the
sea to Euboea to meet Tityos for some unstated reason.91
Rhadamanthys was granted an honoured status in the afterlife in accordance with
his high virtues. Homer mentions in the Odyssey that he lives in the Elysian plain,
though without explaining why; and Pindar places him in the Isles of the Blessed
(which comes to much the same), where he assists Kronos as a counsellor, contin-
uing to exercise his wisdom and justice in this more exalted setting.92 Or in the
usual tradition from the time of Plato onwards, he was appointed to be one of the
judges in the Underworld along with his brother Minos (see p. 122).93
The children of Minos and Pasiphae, and the legend 
of Glaukos
Minos and Pasiphae had four daughters in the usual account, Ariadne, Phaidra,
Akakallis and Xenodike, and four sons, Katreus, Deukalion, Androgeos, and
Glaukos.94 Ariadne, as we have just seen (p. 347), eloped with Theseus, but was
left behind by him on Naxos to become the consort of Dionysos (who rendered her
immortal in some accounts). In spite of the humiliations that Theseus had imposed
on Crete and its royal family, Deukalion, son of Minos, offered Phaidra to him as
a wife, evidently as a diplomatic move; the marriage ended in tragedy when she fell
— Legends of Crete and Athens —
352

in love with her stepson Hippolytos (see p. 358). Akakallis (or Akalle) is a curious
ﬁgure who originated as a minor goddess. She was remembered in Cretan legend as
a heroine who had borne various eponyms and city-founders to Apollo and Hermes.
She bore Naxos, for instance, to Apollo, and Kydon, the eponym of the Cretan city of that
name, to Hermes.95 As was noted above, she was also the mother of Miletos in one version
of his story, though apparently not the earliest. According to Apollonius, Minos became so
angry with her after she had once become pregnant by Apollo that he drove her out, causing
her to settle in Libya, where she gave birth to Garamas, the eponym of a Libyan people
called the Garamantes; a son of his killed one of the Argonauts during their visit to Africa
(see p. 395).96 Nothing is recorded of the life of Xenodike, another heroine who is mentioned
as a daughter of Minos.97
Two of the sons of Minos never rose to power in Crete, Androgeos because he died
early while visiting Attica as an athlete (see p. 340), and Glaukos because he was
the last-born. As the eldest son, Katreus succeeded to the throne after the death
of Minos, and he was succeeded in his turn by his brother Deukalion after he and
his only son died in quick succession in tragic circumstances. Deukalion was the
father of Idomoneus, who was ruler of the Cretans at the time of the Trojan War
and led the Cretan contingent to Troy. Before tracing the history of the ruling line,
we must consider the single myth that is recorded for the young Glaukos.
During his early childhood, GLAUKOS fell into a large jar of honey while chasing
a mouse (or while playing with a ball), and was drowned. Mystiﬁed by his dis-
appearance, Minos searched everywhere for him and ﬁnally called together the ﬁnest
seers of the age to advise him on the best course of action. He was told by the
Kouretes (see p. 219, or by Apollo) that Glaukos would be found by the man who
could ﬁnd the best image to describe a marvellous cow in the king’s possession,
which changed colour every four hours (or twice a day) from white to red and 
then to black. So Minos put this question to the diviners, and Polyidos, a Corinthian
seer who was descended from Melampous (see p. 430), replied most appropriately
that the cow resembled a blackberry (or mulberry), which changes colour in that
sequence as it ripens. Polyidos set to work immediately to apply his skills to discover
the location of the child; and when he saw an owl putting birds to ﬂight above the
cellar in which Glaukos had met his accident, he recognized this as a sign and
searched the cellar until he found the child. Minos was not satisﬁed with a corpse,
however, and ordered that Polyidos should be shut in with the dead child until 
he discovered a way to bring him back to life again. When a snake happened to
approach the child’s body, Polyidos threw a stone at it and killed it, thinking that
he would be in even worse trouble if any harm came to the body. This action 
proved to be his salvation, since another snake crept up to its dead companion and
brought it back to life again by applying a special herb to it; and when Polyidos
imitated the snake by applying the herb to the body of Glaukos, the young 
prince was duly returned to life. Before allowing the seer to sail home with his
reward, Minos demanded that he should teach Glaukos to become a seer like himself.
So Polyidos instructed him under constraint; but as he was about to sail away, he
told Glaukos to spit into his mouth, and on doing so the child forgot all that he
had learned.98

Katreus and his children; Idomoneus and Meriones
KATREUS, the eldest son and successor of Minos, had four children, a son
Althaimenes and three daughters, Apemosyne, Aerope and Klymene.99 When he
once consulted an oracle about how his life would end, he was told that he would
die at the hand of one of his children; and even though he tried to keep the prophecy
secret, his son ALTHAIMENES came to hear of it and sailed away to Rhodes to
avoid any danger of fulﬁlling it. Or in another account, Althaimenes took this action
because he himself had been warned by an oracle that he was fated to kill his
father.100 One of his sisters, Apemosyne, accompanied him into exile. After arriving
on Rhodes, he climbed Mt Atabyrion, the tallest peak on the island, and surveyed
the surrounding area, looking at all the other islands in the neighbourhood. On
catching sight of Crete in the far distance, he began to think of his ancestral gods,
and decided to raise a shrine to Zeus on this Rhodian mountain.101 Such was the
legend that was offered to explain the origin of the cult of Atabyrian Zeus, which
was indeed very ancient, perhaps ultimately of Phoenician origin.
Flight alone would not sufﬁce to save Althaimenes from shedding the blood of
his father; and before doing so, he would cause the death of his sister APEMOSYNE
too. Hermes happened to conceive a passion for Apemosyne, but was unable to catch
her however hard he tried because she could run so much faster than he could; so
he resorted to a ruse instead, by spreading some freshly cut hides across her path
and so causing her to slip to the ground as she was returning from a spring. He
then proceeded to rape her (an uncharacteristic action for Hermes, who is normally
a kindly god). When she told her brother what had happened, he refused to believe
her, thinking that she was trying to conceal a liaison with a mortal lover, and kicked
her so violently that she was killed.102 Some time later, Katreus came to feel that
he was now too old to rule in Crete, and sailed to Rhodes to recall his long-lost
son. When he and his companions landed, however, in a remote part of the island,
the local people mistook them for pirates and pelted them with stones. Although
Katreus tried to explain his purpose, his words were drowned out by the barking
of the dogs; and when Althaimenes arrived on the scene in response to the commo-
tion, he killed his father with a throw of his spear without realizing who he was.
On discovering afterwards that he had killed his father just as the oracle had
predicted, he prayed to the gods to be removed from the earth, and was swallowed
up in a chasm; or he simply died of a broken heart.103
Althaimenes ﬁrst appears in Hellenistic sources; it would seem that he was a hero of Rhodian
origin who was attached to the Cretan royal line by the Rhodians. According to an alterna-
tive tradition, he was of Heraklid birth as a descendant of Temenos (the ﬁrst Heraklid king
of Argos, see p. 291) in the third generation. In that case, he left the Peloponnese with a force
of Dorians and Pelasgians after quarrelling with his elder brother, and was advised by an oracle
to proceed toward Zeus and Helios (the Sun) to ask them for a land to colonize. So he called
in ﬁrst at Crete, which was the birthplace of Zeus, and left some followers there before trav-
elling on to Rhodes, the island of Helios (see p. 43), where he defeated the Carian inhabitants
and founded the three Dorian cities of Lindos, Ialysos and Kameiros.104 This was said to have
occurred at the same period as the Ionian settlement of Asia Minor (see p. 408), well after the
Trojan War; but according to the usual and earlier tradition, the three cities were founded
before the war by the Heraklid Tlepolemos (see p. 293).
— Legends of Crete and Athens —
354

After learning from the above-mentioned oracle that he would be killed by one of
his children, Katreus had come to fear that his daughters KLYMENE and AEROPE
might present a danger to him, and had therefore handed them over to the seafarer
Nauplios to be sold abroad. Nauplios treated them more generously, however, as in
the similar story of Auge (see p. 543), by offering Aerope to Pleisthenes, king of
Mycenae, as a wife and taking Klymene as his own wife.105 Or according to a
conﬂicting tale from a lost play by Euripides, Katreus asked Nauplios to drown
Aerope at sea after discovering that she had been seduced by a slave, but Nauplios
took her to Pleisthenes instead.106 Although there was disagreement on whether she
married Atreus or Pleisthenes (an obscure ﬁgure who was sometimes interposed into
the Mycenaean king-list between Atreus and Agamemnon, see p. 508), she became
the mother of Agamemnon and Menelaos in either case. It so happens that Nauplios
is said to have delivered her to Pleisthenes in surviving accounts of that story. She
was best remembered for the legend that presented her as betraying her husband
Atreus after engaging in a love affair with his brother Thyestes (see p. 506). As for
Klymene, she bore two or more sons to Nauplios, including the prince of inventors
Palamedes (see p. 236).
DEUKALION, son of Minos, the successor of Katreus, has no proper myths of
his own; at the most, he is said to have re-established good relations with Theseus
and Athens by offering his sister Phaidra to him as a wife (see p. 358). His son and
successor IDOMONEUS, who was generally thought to have been the last descen-
dant of Europa to rule in Crete, led a large contingent of Cretans to the Trojan
War in eighty ships.107 He would have been the ﬁrst Greek ruler to realize that
such a war might be in prospect since Menelaos was staying in Crete when he
learned of the abduction of Helen (see pp. 445–6).108 Idomoneus is commended in
the Iliad as one of the most valiant of the Greek warriors, even though he was older
than most of his comrades and his hair was ﬂecked with grey.109 He was numbered
among the warriors who put themselves forward to ﬁght in single combat with
Hektor, and he dominated the ﬁghting for a time while the Greeks were under
desperate pressure by their ships.110 It is stated in the Odyssey that he returned home
safely, and there is no suggestion as yet that he met with any trouble on his arrival.111
In the later tradition, however, he is said to have been forced into exile. There are
two main accounts of how this came about. In one, Idomoneus had entrusted his
kingdom to a certain Leukos, son of Talos, whom he had rescued from exposure;
but Leukos took advantage of his benefactor’s absence to kill his wife and children
and then seize power as a tyrant, and he became sufﬁciently powerful to be able to
drive Idomoneus into exile on his return.112 Or in another account preserved in
Latin sources, Idomoneus was struck by a violent storm during his return voyage
and vowed to sacriﬁce whomever he ﬁrst encountered after making a safe landfall
in Crete; but this turned out to be his own son (or daughter), and he was driven
out by the Cretans when he tried to fulﬁl his vow. Or he actually completed the
sacriﬁce, and was driven out by his people when his action provoked a plague.113
After his departure, he settled at Sallentium on the heel of Italy; Vergil mentions
his presence there without explaining the reason for his exile.114

MERIONES, the Cretan who served as second-in-command to Idomoneus at Troy, was the
son of a certain Molos, who was either an illegitimate son of Deukalion or a further son of
Minos.115 He appears quite frequently in the Iliad as a valiant warrior; he joins with his
commander in offering to oppose Hektor in single combat, ﬁghts bravely in the battle around
the Greek ships, wounding Deiphobos and killing others, and helps Menelaos to recover the
body of Patroklos.116 He is likely to be most familiar, however, as the possessor of a remark-
able leather helmet which was armoured with rows of shining boar’s tusks; since helmets of
this Mycenaean design would have been obsolete long before Homer’s time, the relevant
passage in the Iliad is often quoted to show how extremely ancient material could be preserved
in oral epic. Meriones lends the helmet to Odysseus when he sets off on his night reconnais-
sance in the tenth book of the poem.117 Meriones is mentioned among the warriors in the
Wooden Horse,118 and he apparently returned safely to Crete in the early and local tradition
(even if some late sources claim that he ended up in Sicily or Paphlagonia).119 Diodorus 
reports that he shared a tomb with Idomoneus at Knossos, and that the Cretans honoured the
pair in hero-cult and used to invoke their aid in time of war.120 On witnessing a strange
festival in Crete in which the image of a headless man was exhibited, Plutarch was told that
the efﬁgy represented Meriones’ father Molos, who had been discovered without a head after
he had tried to rape a nymph.121
THESEUS, KING OF ATHENS
Theseus becomes king, and abducts an Amazon, provoking 
an Amazon invasion
We must now return to THESEUS to consider the course of his later life after his
return from Crete. He ascended to the throne immediately after his arrival as a result
of the suicide of his father (see p. 348), and proceeded to institute various political
reforms. It was claimed above all that he achieved the uniﬁcation (‘synoecism’, synoik-
ismos) of Attica by uniting the various independent communities of the land (twelve
in number according to tradition) into a single state ruled from Athens.122
Thucydides already describes how he was supposed to have abolished the councils
and magistracies of the individual settlements to create a single assembly and seat
of government in the capital city.123 In reality, of course, this would have been a
gradual process. Since Athens was noted in classical times for its large population
of resident aliens or ‘metics’ (meroikoi), who made an invaluable contribution to the
economic and cultural life of the city, this feature of the state was also attributed
to the foresight of Theseus, who was said to have laid the ground for it by ﬁrst
encouraging the settlement of resident foreigners. To commemorate his two main
achievements, he founded the annual festivals of the Synoikia and Metoikia. Another
of his innovations was supposed to have been the introduction of the ﬁrst Athenian
coinage; the coins were said to have been stamped with the image of an ox rather
than of an owl as in later times. A convenient though by no means complete account
of the innovations and reforms (even extending to the introduction of a form of
democracy!) can be found in Plutarch’s life of Theseus; most of this pseudo-histor-
ical material was of Hellenistic origin.124
Theseus was faced with a revolt at some point from PALLAS, son of Pandion, a
younger brother of Aigeus, and his ﬁfty sons, the Pallantidai. Pallas laid claim to the
— Legends of Crete and Athens —
356

throne on the allegation that the true father of Aigeus had not been Pandion, king of
Athens, but rather a certain Skyrios (presumably the eponym of the island of Skyros,
where Theseus was supposed to have owned ancestral properties, see p. 362). There
was disagreement as to whether Pallas launched his revolt in the present period
immediately after Theseus’ ascent to the throne, or later when Theseus was married
to Phaidra, or earlier when Theseus ﬁrst arrived in Athens.125 In the fullest account,
as recorded by Plutarch, Pallas divided his force, marching openly against Athens
from Sphettos with part of it while the other part lay hidden at Gargettos on the other
side of the city, so as to be able to launch a surprise attack from the rear; but a herald
called Leos betrayed the plan to Theseus, who was thus able to slaughter the concealed
troops in a surprise attack of his own. On hearing of their fate, the other contingent
scattered and the revolt petered out. The episode is ﬁrst attested in a passing allusion
by Euripides, who remarks that Theseus once went to Troizen in the company of
Phaidra to be puriﬁed after slaughtering the Pallantidai.126 An Athenian tradition
stated that Theseus was tried for murder at the court of the Delphinion, but was
acquitted on a plea of justiﬁed killing.127
As his ﬁrst foreign adventure after his rise to power, Theseus sailed to the land of
the Amazons in the north-eastern corner of Asia Minor and abducted an Amazon to
make her his wife or concubine. She is usually named as ANTIOPE, or occasionally
as Hippolyte or Melanippe.128 In one version of the legend, Theseus sailed to the
region as an ally of Herakles when the hero was sent to fetch the belt of the Amazon
queen Hippolyte (see p. 263), and Antiope was awarded to him by Herakles as a
reward for his valiant assistance.129 Or Herakles was vainly attempting to capture the
Amazon city of Themiscyra by siege, Antiope fell in love with Theseus and betrayed
the city so as to be able to join him.130 On chronological grounds, however, most
mythographers favoured the alternative tradition in which Theseus led an expedition
of his own to the area at a later period than that of Herakles.131 Very little is recorded
from the early tradition about this enterprise. Pindar remarks that Theseus was
accompanied by his friend Peirithoos (see below), who is also shown among his allies
on Attic vase-paintings, and Pherecydes is reported to have written that Theseus
seized the Amazon with the help of his charioteer Phorbas.132 He can be seen taking
her to his chariot or carrying her off in it in vase-paintings from the latter part of the
sixth century BC onwards. Plutarch cites a version in which the Amazons were more
friendly than they are usually represented as being and sent an Amazon to Theseus’
ship with gifts; but the hero took advantage of the situation to abduct her, by
inviting her on to his ship and then immediately sailing off.133 Theseus brought an
Amazon back to Athens with him in any case, where she seems to have lived quite
happily with him, bearing him a son Hippolytos.
The Amazons were greatly angered by the abduction of their sister-Amazon, as
is natural, and ventured into Greece for the ﬁrst time in their history to exact
vengeance against Theseus. According to Hellanicus, they travelled by way of the
northern shores of the Black Sea, crossing over the Cimmerian Bosporos (i.e. the
Straits of Azov, between Asia and the Crimea) while it was frozen over in winter.134
On arriving at Athens, they set up camp at a place known as the Amazeion, which
was apparently situated on the slopes of the Areiopagos; according to Aeschylus,
the Areiopagos (Hill of Ares, see p. 365) ﬁrst came to be known as such because

they offered sacriﬁces to their main god Ares on it during their stay.135 Antiope
had no wish to be taken home in the usual tradition, and joined battle at Theseus’
side until she was killed by an Amazon called Molpadia. When the warrior-women
were ﬁnally defeated, the survivors ﬂed to neighbouring Megara and beyond, hence
(so it was claimed) the Amazon graves that could be seen in various parts of Greece.
Plutarch’s life of Theseus provides a detailed account of the battle, and also refers
to accounts in which Theseus’ wife arranged a peace-treaty after the war had dragged
on for three months, or secretly arranged for the wounded Amazons to be nursed
at Chalcis in Euboea. The tomb of Antiope could be seen at Athens in historical
times, as could that of the Amazon who had killed her.136
The tragedy of Phaidra and Hippolytos
It was convenient that Antiope should be removed from the scene since Theseus
was said to have married the Cretan princess PHAIDRA at some point,137 either as
his second wife or as his only legitimate wife if the Amazon had merely been his
concubine. There was also an account, however, apparently originating in early epic,
in which Antiope was still alive at the time of the wedding; for Plutarch cites the
author of the Theseis as stating that she and some fellow Amazons attacked Theseus
after the marriage but were killed by Herakles.138 Apollodorus records a similar
story in which the previous wife of Theseus and some other Amazons tried to break
into the wedding-feast fully armed with the intention of killing the guests; but
Theseus’ men managed to close the doors, and she was intercepted and killed
outside.139 Phaidra was offered to Theseus by her brother Deukalion, who was now
king of Crete, apparently as a diplomatic measure to ease the bad relations that had
prevailed between Crete and Athens since the murder of Androgeos. Theseus fathered
two sons by her, Akamas and Demophon, and adopted them as his heirs, sending
his previous son Hippolytos away to his grandfather Pittheus in Troizen.140
Since Pittheus had no sons of his own, HIPPOLYTOS could have expected to
succeed him as king of Troizen, but he was destined to meet an early death instead
as a result of the machinations of his stepmother. For Phaidra conceived a desperate
passion for him, and was so mortiﬁed when he rejected her that she made false alle-
gations against him, telling Theseus that had tried to rape or seduce her. Taking
her at her word, Theseus cursed him to Poseidon, who sent a bull from the sea to
frighten his horses as he was driving his chariot along the shore at Troizen, causing
him to be thrown out and killed. On hearing of his fate, Phaidra was overcome by
remorse and hanged herself.141 Such was the original version of the story, so far as
we can tell; but Phaidra is portrayed more sympathetically in Euripides’ surviving
Hippolytos (his second play on the theme).
In this play, Hippolytos is presented as a chaste and austere huntsman who is a
devotee of the virgin goddess Artemis. He has scorned the cult and works of
Aphrodite, by contrast, provoking the goddess of love to create trouble for him by
causing Phaidra to fall helplessly in love with him. Phaidra is ashamed of her semi-
incestuous passion in this account, and struggles in vain to subdue it, even trying
to ﬁnd a release in death by refusing her food; but her practically minded nurse
worms the secret out of her, and then approaches Hippolytos on her behalf without
— Legends of Crete and Athens —
358

her knowledge. The young Hippolytos, who is portrayed as an unimaginative and
self-righteous young man, is thoroughly shocked and responds with a long diatribe
on the vileness of women; and when Phaidra hears of this, she fears that Hippolytos
will denounce her and takes her own life, leaving a note accusing him of rape 
(partly out of anger, and partly to ensure that her reputation and the prospects of
her sons will be salvaged). On reading the letter, Theseus curses Hippolytos to his
father Poseidon (who had previously promised him the fulﬁlment of three curses),
and scornfully brushes aside his son’s protestations of innocence. Poseidon causes
Hippolytos to be fatally injured at Troizen in the manner described above, and his
fellow hunters carry him home to his father in the ﬁnal scene of the play; 
having learned the truth from Artemis just before, when the situation was already
past mending, Theseus begs his son’s forgiveness and is reconciled with him before
he expires.142
Hippolytos was accorded divine honours at Troizen at a shrine that had supposedly been
founded by Diomedes. The maidens of the city used to visit his shrine before their marriage
to dedicate a lock of their hair to him (a practice foretold by Artemis at the end of Euripides’
Hippolytos).143 When Pausanias visited the region, he found that the Troizenians refused to
show his grave or acknowledge the usual story of his death (ofﬁcially at least), claiming
instead that he had been raised to the heavens to become the constellation of the Charioteer
(Auriga).144 The standard death-story was ﬁrmly established in the local folklore nonethe-
less, for his grave could in fact be seen there, as could the old twisted olive-tree on which
his reins had become entangled before he was thrown from his chariot.145 Visitors could also
see a myrtle-tree that grew with perforated leaves because Phaidra had mutilated them in
her frustration as she was spying on Hippolytos while he was taking exercise nearby.146
An early tradition which can be traced back to the Naupactia, a lost epic composed in 
the sixth century BC or thereabouts, suggested that Asklepios restored Hippolytos to life again
after his unfortunate death, presumably because he considered that his fate had been un-
deserved.147 This story inspired the development of a curious Italian appendix to the legend
of Hippolytos in which he was said to have been transferred to Latium to become a cultic asso-
ciate of Diana, an ancient Italian goddess who was identiﬁed with Artemis. Her most vener-
able cultic centre was her sacred grove at Aricia, which was situated beneath the Alban Mount
about seventeen miles south-east of Rome; it lay in a wooded hollow by a still lake, the Lacus
Nemorensis (Lake of Nemi), which was also known by the more poetic name of Diana’s
Mirror. Diana shared the grove with two interesting lesser deities, the spring-goddess Egeria,
who also had a cult at Rome and was supposed to have acted as adviser to Romulus’ successor
Numa Pompilius, and an obscure minor god of aged appearance called VIRBIUS. Now it was
a rule of the grove that horses were strictly excluded from it; and to account for the origin of
this rule along with the origin of Virbius himself, the following supplement was added to the
legend of Hippolytos. After he was revived by Asklepios (with the help of the healing-god
Paian in this account from Ovid) Diana/Artemis enshrouded him in a deep mist because she
knew that the lord of the Underworld disapproved of the revival of mortals. To ensure his
future safety, she then transformed his appearance to make him look older, conferred a new
name on him (which would have been desirable in any case since his old one would have
reminded him of horses, hippoi), and spirited him away to her grove at Aricia to live there
under her protection as a minor god. Since he had been dragged to his death by horses, he
wanted to have nothing more to do with them and they were banned from the grove from
that time onwards; and it could be explained that he was now called Virbius because he had
been ‘a man twice over’ (a Latin etymology, vir bis!).148

Theseus and Peirithoos abduct Helen, and try to abduct
Persephone from the Underworld
Theseus was accompanied on his later adventures (including his journey to the land
of the Amazons in some accounts) by his friend PEIRITHOOS, who was a Lapith
chieftain from northern Thessaly. Plutarch provides a rather facile story to explain
how the pair came to form their partnership. To test whether Theseus was really as
strong and brave as his reputation suggested, Peirithoos drove some of his cattle
away from the plain of Marathon in northern Attica and turned to confront him
when he arrived in pursuit. Each was so impressed by the courage and bearing of
the other that they refrained from ﬁghting, and Peirithoos reached his hand out to
Theseus and declared that he was ready to submit to any penalty that he proposed;
but Theseus asked to become his friend instead, and they spent much of their time
together from that moment onward.149 When Peirithoos married the Lapith princess
Hippodameia, Theseus visited him in his northern homeland to attend the wedding
and fought at his side in the ensuing conﬂict between the Lapiths and the Centaurs
(see further on p. 555); and the two friends went off together to take part in the
hunt for the Calydonian boar and (in some accounts) the voyage of the Argonauts.150
But their most remarkable enterprise was the ﬁnal one in which they set out to
abduct the daughters of Zeus, including the queen of the Underworld, as new brides
after the death of their wives.
They began by seizing Helen from Sparta. This is a very ancient legend which
must already have been known to Homer in some form, since he mentions in the
Iliad that Theseus’ mother Aithra (who was captured when Helen was recovered
from Attica, see below) was present at Troy as a servant of Helen.151 Alcman and
Stesichorus are reported to have written about the episode.152 Although Helen was
presumably of marriageable age in the original version, this would have come to
seem implausible when rational and consistent chronologies were developed for this
period of mythical history, and mythographers from Hellanicus onwards suggest
accordingly that she was still a young girl aged seven, or ten, or twelve or the
like.153 In Diodorus’ account of the story, Peirithoos visited Theseus after the death
of Hippodameia, and proposed the abduction after learning that his friend too had
lost his wife; and after seizing Helen, who was only ten but already surpassed all
other women in beauty, they cast lots for her on the agreement that the one who
gained her would help his friend to gain whatever bride he chose, whatever peril
that might entail. So when Peirithoos lost and declared that he wanted to seize
Persephone from the Underworld, Theseus was obliged to assist him. Plutarch offers
a similar version, reporting that the pair captured Helen as she was dancing in the
temple of Artemis Orthia at Sparta, and were pursued as far as Tegea in southern
Arcadia.154 Or else each hero made his own choice of bride, Theseus choosing Helen
ﬁrst of all.155 According to Hellanicus, they thought that they deserved to marry
daughters of Zeus because Peirithoos was a son of Zeus and Theseus a son of
Poseidon.156 Hyginus records a strange version in which Zeus observed their daring
abduction of Helen and then appeared to them in a dream to recommend that they
should ask Hades to hand over Persephone as a bride for Peirithoos.157
— Legends of Crete and Athens —
360

Before setting off for the Underworld, Theseus took Helen to Aphidnai in north-
eastern Attica and entrusted her to the care of Aphidnos, the eponymous ruler of
the town, telling him to keep her there under the strictest secrecy; and he summoned
his mother Aithra from Troizen to act as her companion. The secret was betrayed
or leaked out, however, and the two brothers of Helen, the Dioskouroi, invaded
Attica during Theseus’ absence and attacked Aphidnai. They soon seized the town
and recovered their sister, and also took Aithra home with them to Sparta, where
she was obliged to serve Helen as a maid. While they were in Attica, they exacted
vengeance against Theseus by transferring the throne to Menestheus, son of Peteos,
a member of another branch of the Athenian royal family. Akamas and Demophon,
the two sons of Theseus, ﬂed to Euboea to take refuge with Elephenor, king of the
Abantes; see pp. 375–6 for their subsequent history.158
Two main stories were developed to explain how the Dioskouroi came to discover where
Helen was being hidden. According to Herodotus, they terrorized the people of Athens by
burning their villages until the men of Dekaleia, or perhaps Dekalos himself, agreed to guide
them to Helen’s hiding-place; and for that reason, the Spartans granted special privileges to
the Dekaleians ever afterwards and left their town unharmed whenever they invaded Attica159
Dekaleia, which lay in north-central Attica, was used by the Spartans as a forward base
during the Peloponnesian War. According to another account, the secret was betrayed by
Akademos, the eponym of the Academy (Akadameia), a sacred grove on the outskirts of
Athens which is best remembered as the site of Plato’s school (hence modern ‘academies’).160
According to an eccentric tale from Stesichorus, Theseus fathered a child, Iphigeneia, by
Helen, who gave birth to her in the Argolid while travelling home and handed her over to
Klytaimnestra (who was of course her true mother in the usual tradition).161
After descending below at the bottomless cave at Tainaron in the southern Pelopon-
nese, Theseus and Peirithoos somehow persuaded the infernal ferryman Charon to
convey them across the boundary-river (see p. 113) into the realm of Hades. Two
surviving lines from the early epic account in the Minyas indicate that they had to
wait by the river-bank for a time until Charon’s boat returned to its moorings.162
It would seem that they approached Hades openly to ask him to release Persephone
rather than attempting to abduct her by stealth, but very little is recorded of this
aspect of the adventure in surviving sources. Another epic fragment gives an impres-
sion of the sort of reasoning that they might have employed, stating that Peirithoos
believed that he had a better claim to Persephone because he was a child of Zeus
like herself while Hades was merely her uncle!163 It was crazy, of course, to suppose
that Hades would surrender his wife to a mortal on this or any other ground, and
he proceeded to imprison them in his underground kingdom. According to Apollo-
dorus, he made a show of friendliness, inviting the two of them to sit down as if
they were about to enjoy his hospitality; but when they did so, they found that
their ﬂesh became attached to the seat, the ‘Chair of Forgetfulness’ (thronos Le¯the¯s),
and that they were also bound down by coils of snakes in addition.164 The epic 
poet Panyasis already stated that their ﬂesh became attached to the rock that they
were sitting on, and we read elsewhere that they were held down by chains or coils
of serpents.165

Although both were probably detained forever in the original story, it came to
be believed that Herakles released one or both of them when he descended to the
Underworld to fetch Kerberos (as his penultimate or ﬁnal labour, see p. 268). In
the usual account, the great hero was able to pull Theseus up from his seat, but
not Peirithoos since he carried the greater guilt as the one who had proposed the
abduction of Persephone. In Apollodorus’ narrative, the earth shook in warning when
Herakles extended his hand to Peirithoos.166 There are conﬂicting accounts, however,
in which Peirithoos was rescued also or neither was released.167
The exile and death of Theseus
On arriving home from Hades, Theseus discovered that Menestheus had seized power
with the help of the Dioskouroi and was now ﬁrmly in control. So he had to seek
a new home and sailed to Skyros, an island in the Aegean to the east of Euboea,
because he owned ancestral lands there; or else he arrived there by accident after
being blown off course as he was trying to travel to the court of his father-in-law
Deukalion in Crete.168 Although Lykomedes, the king of the island, pretended to
be happy to receive him, he set to work to contrive his death because he feared that
his own position might be threatened if such a great hero should be present in the
land, or because he wanted to perform a favour for Menestheus. He achieved his
aim by taking Theseus up to the highest point on the island on the pretext of
showing him his estates and then pushing him over a cliff. Or in a more banal
account that absolves Lykomedes from any blame, Theseus simply slipped and fell
as he was taking his after-dinner walk. His season of glory had passed in any case;
Plutarch remarks that his death attracted little attention at the time.169
Menestheus continued to rule at Athens until he left to ﬁght at Troy as leader
of the Athenian contingent.170 Since he was either killed in the ﬁghting or decided
to settle abroad afterwards, one or both of the sons of Theseus were able to recover
their father’s kingdom after the war (see p. 375).
Theseus brought posthumous aid to the Athenians at the battle of Marathon, marching ahead
of them in full armour as they advanced against the Persians.171 After the Persian Wars, the
Delphic oracle ordered that his bones should be fetched home to Athens; and when Cimon,
a prominent Athenian statesman and general, captured Skyros in 475 BC, he was thus very
eager to locate the hero’s burial-place. One day, when he noticed that an eagle had landed
on what appeared to be a burial-mound and was pecking at it with its beak and tearing at
it with its talons, he concluded that this must be a sign and ordered his followers to dig
at that spot. When they did so, they found the cofﬁn of a man of enormous size (as the
heroes of old were supposed to have been) with a bronze spear and a sword lying beside it.
Thinking that these must surely be the remains and arms of Theseus, Cimon brought them
back to Athens to the great enthusiasm of the people, and the exiled hero was received back
into his city.172
In some celebrated stories from Attic tragedy, Theseus is presented as a noble ruler who
came to the aid of heroes and heroines from other cycles of myth when they fell victim to
misfortune and injustice. He granted sanctuary to the blind and exiled Oedipus at Kolonos
just outside Athens, saving him and his daughter from being hauled back to Thebes by
Kreon (see p. 314); at the urging of Adrastos, he forced Kreon, king of Thebes, to consent
— Legends of Crete and Athens —
362

to the burial of the Argive dead after the expedition of the Seven (see p. 322); and he granted
refuge to the Heraklids at Athens after the death of their father and helped them to defeat
their persecutor, Eurystheus (see p. 287).
THE ATHENIAN ROYAL FAMILY
Athenian legends and the Athenian king-list
We must now complete our survey of Athenian myth by tracing the mythical history
of Attica from the ages that preceded the birth of Theseus to those that followed
his death. Although Attica had a hero of the very ﬁrst rank in Theseus, and also
produced a few lesser ﬁgures such as Daidalos, Kephalos or Menestheus who played
a role in major episodes from saga, the province was of surprisingly limited signiﬁ-
cance in early heroic myth. If due exception is made for the stories that have already
been covered in this chapter, most of the legends of Attica and the Athenian royal
family can be assigned to the category of local myth, either as tales from folklore
or as antiquarian legends that were devised to account for the origin of local cults,
institutions and other peculiarities. Even if Attic legends of this kind were prob-
ably of no greater interest or number than those of many another province, the
cultural and political prominence of Athens from the time of the Persian Wars
onwards, and also the eloquence of its writers, ensured that they came to be better
known than many of their equivalents in other lands. The legends of the province
also attracted special interest from the mythographers. Hellanicus made a particular
study of them in the ﬁfth century BC, and authors of the Hellenistic period followed
his lead by developing a special branch of literature, Atthidography, that was devoted
to the antiquities of the land. For reasons such as these, this largely provincial body
of legend established a ﬁrm foothold in the canon of panhellenic myth (as is attested
by the full treatment of it in Apollodorus’ handbook).
The Attic king-list was a highly artiﬁcial creation that did not ﬁnally acquire its
deﬁnitive form, as shown in Table 19, until as late as the third century BC. In the
time of Herodotus, it would seem that only four kings were recognized as having
reigned before Theseus, ﬁrstly Kekrops and Erechtheus/Erichthonios, the earthborn
ﬁrst rulers of the land, and then Pandion and Aigeus, the two predecessors of Theseus.
But since Kekrops and Erichthonios were supposed to have lived at the very begin-
ning of history (like Pelasgos in Arcadia or Deukalion in Central Greece) while
Theseus and his immediate predecessors must have lived in the period directly
preceding the Trojan War, the mythographers were obliged to add several new names
to the list if it was to be synchronized with comparable lines in other places (such as
Argos or Thebes). This was achieved in two ways. In the ﬁrst place, additional earth-
born rulers, Kranaos and Amphiktyon (who were already known as early Athenians
but not as kings), were inserted between Kekrops and Erichthonios at the head of the
list; and second, some kings who were already included in the list were reduplicated.
A second Kekrops and a second Pandion were thus introduced, while Erechtheus/
Erichthonios (who was originally the same person under two different names, see
below) was divided into two separate individuals, the earthborn Erichthonios and his

grandson Erechtheus, son of Pandion. By this process, the following king-list was
developed: Kekrops I – Kranaos – Amphiktyon – Erichthonios – Pandion I – Erech-
theus – Kekrops II – Pandion II – Aigeus – Theseus. Since the early kings of Athens
not only originated in cult rather than in heroic myth but were also reduplicated in
many cases, it is hardly surprising that most of them should be insubstantial ﬁgures
with few proper myths. As a further step in the systematization of Attic myth,
mythographers allocated ﬂoating stories associated with other heroes or heroines to a
speciﬁc point in time, usually by attaching the relevant hero or heroine to the royal
line as a child or descendant of a particular king.
Kekrops, the earthborn ﬁrst king of Athens, and his children
The Athenians commonly supposed that their earliest king was KEKROPS, who
had sprung from the earth and bore the marks of his chthonic origin in his twofold
form, for he had a serpent’s tail in place of human legs.173 The autochthony of
Kekrops and Erichthonios (and of Kranaos and Amphiktyon too in the fully devel-
oped king-list) reﬂected the proud claim of the Athenians to be an ‘autochthonous’
or indigenous people who had inhabited their land from very ancient times, and
provided a mythical conﬁrmation for that claim; as it happens, this cherished belief
of theirs was not wholly unfounded, for the Athenians had inhabited their own land
for longer than most of their neighbours, and certainly for longer than the Dorians
in the Peloponnese. Since the Athenians were also distinguished by the special rela-
tionship that they enjoyed with Athena, the guardian-goddess of their city and land,
it was assumed that the goddess must have established herself as the patroness of
the land in the time of its ﬁrst king, so ensuring that the city acquired its proper
identity at the very beginning of its history (just as the Argives assumed that Hera
had established herself as the great goddess of their land in the time of their ﬁrst
king, Phoroneus, see p. 227). As has been recounted in connection with the myth-
ology of Poseidon, Athena won her position in the city by defeating Poseidon in a
contest for the land (see p. 102); and Kekrops played a crucial part in determining
the outcome in most accounts, whether by acting as arbitrator (on his own or in
conjunction with Kranaos), or by bearing witness before the twelve gods that Athena
had laid claim to the land by planting the ﬁrst olive-tree there.174 This is the only
myth from the early tradition in which Kekrops is assigned any active role; he was
a venerable ancestor, a sort of Adam, rather than a subject of legend.
When the Atthidographers of the Hellenistic period set out to develop a coherent account of
the growth of civilization in Athens, they came to describe Kekrops as a primordial culture-
hero who had introduced the ﬁrst elements of civilization to Attica (or indeed to the human
race) and had founded some of the most ancient cults of the land, much as Phoroneus was
supposed to have done in Argos, or Pelasgos in Arcadia. Among other innovations, he was
said to have introduced the ﬁrst laws, the building of cities, the practice of burying the dead,
the use of animal-skins for clothing, and even the art of writing175 (although Kadmos, see 
p. 298, and Palamedes were more favoured candidates for that particular honour). The best-
known story of this kind, the one that presents him as the inventor of monogamous marriage,
was apparently devised to provide a rationalistic (if far-fetched) explanation for the origin of
— Legends of Crete and Athens —
364

the idea of his hybrid form; for Clearchus of Soloi (third century BC) claimed that he had come
to be credited with this form because he had tried to abolish promiscuity in favour of a perma-
nent union between men and women in which the contrasting natures of each would be united
into one.176 In the religious realm, Kekrops was said to have founded the cult of Zeus Hypatos
(the Highest) on the Acropolis, which could be thought to be very ancient because the god
was honoured with offerings of honey-cakes rather than with blood-sacriﬁces, and to have
established the cult and festival of the pre-Olympian deity Kronos.177 In poetic parlance, the
Athenians could be called Kekropians (Kekropiai or Kekropidai) after their ﬁrst king, and
Athens the city of Kekrops.
Instead of taking a local nymph as his wife as did many primordial rulers, Kekrops
married Aglauros, the daughter of a certain Aktaios (or Aktaion); some antiquar-
ians claimed that this Aktaios (Coast-man) had in fact preceded him as the ﬁrst
king of Athens, which had originally been named Akte after him. Aglauros (or
Agraulos) bore three notable daughters, HERSE, PANDROSOS and AGLAUROS
(or Agraulos), to her semi-serpentine husband, and also a son of lesser interest called
Erysichthon.178
The three girls, the Kekropides or Aglaurides, were best remembered for the part
that they played in the story of Erichthonios. When this strangely conceived child
was brought to birth by Gaia (see p. 184 for the story of his origin), she handed
him over to Athena, who shut him up in a chest and entrusted him to the daugh-
ters of Kekrops, strictly ordering them not to open it. Needless to say, the temptation
was irresistible, and one or more of the sisters peered into the chest, with disastrous
consequences. Although the basic story is always much the same, it is recorded in
all manner of different versions. In the earliest surviving account in Euripides’ Ion,
the three sisters opened the chest to discover that Athena had place two guardian-
snakes in it along with the child, and they met a bloody death afterwards on some
rocks, presumably after jumping down from the Acropolis in terror or madness as
in some later accounts. It is usually suggested in subsequent sources that one or
two of the sisters alone peeped into the chest and so incurred this fate. According
to Apollodorus, the chest was entrusted to Pandrosos, but her two sisters opened it
and were killed by the guardian-snake that was coiled around the child. These were
the erring sisters in Pausanias’ version also (although we are told here that the chest
was entrusted to all three of them); or in an account by the early Hellenistic mythog-
rapher Amelesagoras, the offence was committed by Aglauros and Pandrosos, or in
Ovid’s version, by Aglauros alone. If Athena was planning to make the child im-
mortal, as Apollodorus alone reports, the girls may have frustrated her plan.179
Whatever part they may have played in this joint myth, all three sisters were said
to have embarked on love affairs with gods which resulted in the birth of various
minor children. According to a fairly old tradition, Aglauros bore a daughter
ALKIPPE to Ares, the god of war. This Alkippe appears together with her father
in a legend that was devised to account for the origin of the Areiopagos, an ancient
high court at Athens that tried crimes involving bloodshed. When a brutal son of
Poseidon called Halirrhothios (Sea-foam) tried to rape Alkippe, Ares caught him in
the act and killed him, much to the anger of Poseidon, who prosecuted the war-
god for murder in a trial judged by the twelve gods (i.e. the other major Olympian

gods). In the course of the trial, which was held on a hill to the west of the Acropolis
that was known thenceforth as the Areiopagos (Hill of Ares), Ares persuaded the
court that he had been justiﬁed in killing a man who was trying to rape a close
relation of his (as would have been acceptable in classical Athens if the rapist were
killed immediately after being caught in ﬂagrante).180 In the three subsequent trials
that were held on the Areiopagos in mythical times, Kephalos was condemned to
exile for accidentally killing his wife (see p. 372), Daidalos was condemned to death
in absentia for murdering his nephew (see p. 340), and, most famously of all, Orestes
was tried there for killing his mother in the ﬁrst case to be judged by a jury of
Athenian citizens (see p. 511).
Other tales told of liaisons between daughters of Kekrops and the god Hermes.
Pandrosos (or one or other of her sisters) bore him a son Keryx (Herald), who was
of some local importance as the mythical ancestor of the Eleusinian family of the
Kerykes, which provided the heralds who presided at the Eleusinian Mysteries.181
This at least was the belief of the Kerykes themselves, since some claimed that
Keryx had been a son of Eumolpos (a ﬁgure who was closely associated with Eleusis
and the mysteries, see p. 370).182 Herse was also seduced by Hermes and bore him
a son called Kephalos, who grew up to be so beautiful that he was abducted by
Eos, goddess of the dawn (see p. 47).183 This Kephalos should properly be distin-
guished from the Kephalos who married Prokris, a later princess of Athens, but the
two were sometimes confused, as we will see (p. 372). The traditional story of a
liaison between Hermes and Herse inspired the development of a tale of sisterly
jealousy that is recounted by Ovid in the Metamorphoses. On seeing the lovely Herse
among the maidens who were carrying the sacred objects to the temple of Athena
during the great festival of the Panathenaia, Hermes fell desperately in love with
her; and when he tried to ﬁnd her at her home afterwards, he encountered her sister
Aglauros, who offered to help him if he would reward her with a fortune in gold.
Athena was angry with Aglauros, however, for having opened the chest that
contained Erichthonios, and she was therefore determined that the girl should not
win the favour of Hermes and a fortune in gold besides. So she incited Envy (Invidia
in Ovid’s Latin) to frustrate her plan by causing her to become jealous of her sister
for having gained the love of a god. Overcome by this new-found jealousy, Aglauros
was no longer willing to assist Hermes when he arrived to court her sister, but
seated herself in front of the door of Herse’s bedroom to prevent him from entering.
When she persisted in her action in spite of his appeals, retorting that she would
remain exactly where she was, he said ‘Granted!’ and turned her to stone, opening
up the door with a wave of his wand. The stone was as dark as Aglauros’ thoughts.
This tale was apparently of Hellenistic origin, at least in its original form, since a
papyrus from Herculaneum has revealed an earlier version, probably by Callimachus,
in which Pandrosos was turned to stone.184
ERYSICHTHON, the only son of Kekrops, was a minor culture-hero who was
associated primarily with Prasiai on the east coast of Attica; he was said to have
died there while still young and childless as he was returning from the holy island
of Delos with a statue of Eileithuia, goddess of Childbirth. Of the three ancient
wooden images (xoana) of the goddess that could be seen at her temple at Athens,
one was identiﬁed as the image that Erysichthon had brought from Delos, while
— Legends of Crete and Athens —
366

the other two were supposed to have been brought from Crete several generations
later by Phaidra (the Cretan princess who married Theseus). Erysichthon’s tomb
could be seen at Prasiai, where his corpse was said to have been buried after his
ship had arrived in port.185
Three further earthborn kings, Kranaos, Amphiktyon 
and Erichthonios
As was noted above, two minor heroes, Kranaos and Amphiktyon, were inserted
into the king-list as successors of Kekrops. The earthborn KRANAOS ruled at the
time of the great ﬂood and was thus a contemporary of Deukalion, who even sought
refuge with him in one account; he named the land of Attica after his daughter
Atthis, who was borne to him along with two other daughters by his Spartan wife
Pedias.186 He was eventually driven out by AMHIKTYON, who was earthborn like
himself (or was sometimes identiﬁed with Amphiktyon, son of Deukalion, whose
proper home was Thermopylae, see p. 404). This was an act of treachery in one
account because Amphiktyon was married to the king’s daughter Atthis (although
this conﬂicts with another tradition in which Kranaos named the land after Atthis
when she died young as an unmarried maiden). There is nothing of interest to report
of Amphiktyon except that Dionysos was supposed to have visited him in Athens
and taught him how to mix water into wine in the proper proportion (for it was
the Greek custom to water wine before serving it).187
After twelve years, Amphiktyon was expelled in his turn by yet another earth-
born hero, ERICHTHONIOS.188 In contrast to local autochthones like Kekrops 
and Pelasgos who sprang from the earth without need of a father, Erichthonios was
conceived by Gaia (Earth) to a speciﬁc divine father, Hephaistos; for Gaia was fertil-
ized by semen that was emitted by him as he was trying to make love to Athena,
as described in Chapter 5 (see p. 184). Since Athena was not only involved in the
incident that led to Erichthonios’ conception, but also received him from Gaia imme-
diately after his birth and reared him herself on the Acropolis (after brieﬂy entrusting
him to the daughters of Kekrops), she came as close to being a mother to him as
was possible for a virgin goddess. The special relationship that she had established
with Athens in the time of Kekrops was thus deepened; and the strange birth-
legend also explained how the city came to be placed under the joint patronage of
Athena and Hephaistos, as two deities who presided over the handicrafts that were
so essential to the city’s prosperity.
In the Hellenistic and later tradition, a clear distinction was drawn between
Erichthonios, the marvellous child who was born from the earth and reared by
Athena, and Erechtheus, who was remembered in more adult roles as a leader in war
and paterfamilias and was honoured in cult on the Acropolis in close connection with
Poseidon. It is generally believed, however, that this distinction with the accom-
panying division of roles was ﬁrst established by the mythographers for chronological
reasons, and that the two ﬁgures were originally a single person under alternative
names. The most telling evidence in this regard is the fact that Homer and Herodotus
apply the name Erechtheus to the earthborn hero; Homer refers in the Iliad to ‘great-
hearted Erechtheus, who was reared of old by Athena, daughter of Zeus, when the

grain-giving ploughland brought him to birth’, and Herodotus refers similarly to
Erechtheus as earthborn.189 There is no unequivocal evidence for the name Erich-
thonios until it appears in the visual arts and tragedy in the second half of the ﬁfth
century BC (although it is reported without direct citation that Pindar and the author
of the Danais, an early epic of uncertain date, applied the name to the earthborn
child).190 It seems altogether probable in any case that the longer name was of later
origin, especially in view of the fact that Erechtheus/Erichthonios was known as
Erechtheus in connection with his cult on the Acropolis. After the dividing of the
inheritance, only a single notable deed was assigned to Erichthonios as an adult,
namely the founding of the Panathenaia, the principal festival of Athena at Athens;
since he was identiﬁed as the nursling who had been reared by Athena, it is under-
standable that this particular action should have been credited to him rather than to
Erechtheus. Since games were held in connection with the festival, it was further
suggested that he invented the four-horse chariot and used to compete as a chariot-
driver in the games; an astral myth adds that Zeus was so impressed by his initiative
in imitating the sun-god Helios (who travelled across the sky in a chariot of this kind,
see p. 43) that he raised him to the heavens to become the constellation of the
Charioteer (Auriga). It is no surprise to discover that his wife bore the same name,
Praxithea, as the wife of Erechtheus; described as a naiad nymph, she bore him a
single son, Pandion, who succeeded him as king of Athens.191
Pandion and his daughters Prokne and Philomela
PANDION I married his maternal aunt Zeuxippe, who bore him two sons,
Erechtheus and Boutes, and two daughters, Prokne and Philomela.192 Two famous
stories were set in his reign, the legend of Ikarios which told how wine was intro-
duced into Attica (see p. 176), and the grisly legend of TEREUS, king of Thrace,
who married a daughter of Pandion and later raped and mutilated her sister. Pandion
invited the assistance of Tereus when he became embroiled in a border-dispute with
Labdakos, king of Thebes; and after bringing the war to a successful conclusion with
his aid of his Thracian ally, he expressed his gratitude by offering him his elder
daughter PROKNE as a wife. So Tereus took her away to his northern homeland,
where she bore him a son, Itys. All went well until Prokne began to feel lonely and
asked her husband to travel to Athens to fetch her sister PHILOMELA for a visit. As
he was coming back with Philomela, he conceived a violent lust for her and raped
her; and to conceal his crime, he cut out her tongue and hid her away in a remote
spot, telling Prokne that she had died during the journey. But Philomela wove an
account of her sufferings into a tapestry and sent it to her sister, who fetched her 
home and proceeded to exact a grim revenge on Tereus. Slaughtering Itys, the only
child of their union, she boiled his ﬂesh, and served it as a meal to her unknowing
husband. She then took ﬂight with Philomela, heading southward. As soon as Tereus
discovered the true nature of the meal, he hastily seized an axe and chased after the
two sisters, ﬁnally catching up with them at Daulis (an ancient town in Central
Greece to the east of Delphi). They prayed for help to the gods, who took pity on
them and transformed the pursuer and pursued alike into birds, turning Prokne into
a nightingale, Philomela into a swallow and Tereus into a hoopoe (or hawk).193
— Legends of Crete and Athens —
368

Although the transformations follow this pattern in all Greek sources, some Latin sources alter
it by presenting Prokne as the swallow and Philomela as the nightingale;194 and it so happens
that this secondary version is the one that was transmitted into the Renaissance tradition,
hence the use of Philomela (or Philomel, Philomèle etc.) as a poetic name for a nightingale.
The original version is clearly preferable, however, since it explains why the nightingale 
sings so mournfully (she is lamenting her child) and why the swallow chatters inarticulately
(she has no tongue, but persists in trying to tell her story). In some late sources, the murdered
Itys is said to have been transformed into a bird also, namely a pheasant (fasanus).195
According to Ovid at least, Pandion died of grief after learning of the fate of his daughters.196
Although Tereus is always regarded as a Thracian, he is sometimes said to have ruled at
Daulis; or according to a Megarian tradition, he ruled at Pagai in the Megarid, and committed
suicide in Megara after the two sisters escaped into neighbouring Attica.197 He is described
as a son of Ares,198 as is ﬁtting in view of his violent nature and the Thracian connections of
the war-god.
Erechtheus and his war against Eumolpos and the Eleusinians
After Pandion’s death, his twin sons divided the inheritance between them,
ERECHTHEUS taking the throne, and BOUTES the priesthood of Athena and
Poseidon (two deities who had a joint cult in the Erechtheion).199 Boutes was the
eponymous ancestor of the Boutadai and Eteoboutadai, the families that provided 
the priestesses for the cult of Athena Polias; he had a heroic shrine of his own in the
Erechtheion.200 Erechtheus married Praxithea, daughter of Phrasimos, a grand-
daughter of the Attic river-god Kephisos. She bore him four daughters, Prokris,
Oreithuia, Kreousa, and Chthonia, and various sons including a second Kekrops, who
became the next king of Athens, and Metion, whose sons later seized power for a time
by expelling Erechtheus’ grandson. The ever-ingenious Daidalos, whose exploits 
have already been considered, was often classed as a grandson of Erechtheus, either
through Metion or through another son of his called Eupalamos (i.e. Handyman, the
Ingenious).201
The most notable event in the reign of Erechtheus was a war between Athens
and the town of Eleusis about twelve miles to the north-west; the legend of this
conﬂict served to explain how Eleusis, with its famous mystery-cult (which had
supposedly been founded by Demeter herself, see p. 128), came to be absorbed into
the Athenian state. The legend ﬁrst appears in the remains of a lost play by Euripides,
the Erechtheus. When the war broke out, the Eleusinians summoned the aid of
EUMOLPOS, son of Poseidon, who marched to their assistance with a large force
of Thracians. In the face of this threat, Erechtheus consulted the Delphic oracle,
which declared that the Athenians would prevail if the king sacriﬁced one of his
daughters; and when he duly slaughtered his youngest daughter, sometimes named
as Chthonia, his surviving daughters committed suicide because all of them had
sworn beforehand to share the fate of the chosen victim.202 There were also accounts
in which Erechtheus slaughtered more than one of his daughters.203 Although he
proceeded to defeat the enemy in accordance with the oracle, killing Eumolpos in
battle, Poseidon was so angered by the death of his son that he killed Erechtheus
in his turn or asked Zeus to kill him with a thunderbolt; according to Euripides,
Poseidon struck the ground with his trident after the battle, causing the king to

be swallowed up in a chasm.204 After suffering this defeat, the Eleusinians made
peace with the Athenians on the agreement that their city would be subject to
Athens from that time onwards but that they would continue to administer the
mysteries independently.205 In historical times, sacriﬁces were offered to Erechtheus
as a hero at the altar of Poseidon in the Erechtheion.206
Since Eumolpos was the eponymous ancestor of the Eumolpidai, the family that provided
the priests who ofﬁciated at the Eleusinian Mysteries, he could hardly have been a foreigner
from Thrace in the original tradition. The Homeric Hymn to Demeter, which is our earliest
source for him, includes him among the Eleusinian princes who were instructed by Demeter
in her mysteries.207 He was presented as a Thracian, however, in Euripides’ Erechtheus, appar-
ently as a son of Poseidon by Chione, a daughter of Boreas, the North Wind, whose home
lay in Thrace (see p. 48).208 Since Chione’s mother Oreithuia was a daughter of Erechtheus
who had been abducted from Athens by Boreas (see below), Eumolpos was of partly Athenian
descent in this account in spite of his Thracian birth. For his subsequent history, we have
to rely on Apollodorus’ narrative, which may well have been based (directly or indirectly)
on information provided in Euripides’ play. After bearing Eumolpos to Poseidon, Chione
threw him into the sea for fear of her father’s anger, but he was rescued by Poseidon, who
entrusted him to his daughter Benthesikyme to be reared in Ethiopia. When he grew up,
Benthesikyme’s husband (whose name is lost owing to a corruption in the text) offered one
of his daughters to him as a wife, but later sent him into exile when he tried to rape her
sister. Although he found sanctuary in the land of his birth with Tegyrios, king of Thrace,
and his son Ismaros married the daughter of Tegyrios, he was forced into exile once again
when he was caught plotting against him. He went to Eleusis and established friendly rela-
tions with the Eleusinians, but was called back by Tegyrios when Ismaros subsequently died,
and later succeeded to the throne. Since he was now a powerful ruler, the Eleusinians naturally
turned to him when they became embroiled in a war with their more powerful neighbour.209
Some authors, including Isocrates, suggest that Eumolpos was hoping to seize Athens for
himself, laying claim to it on the ground that it properly belonged to his father Poseidon
rather than to Athena (i.e. because he thought that Athena had been wrongly adjudged the
winner when the two gods had competed for the land, seen p. 102).210
There was also a version of the legend in which Eumolpos was not killed by Erechtheus
but survived to return to Eleusis, where he presided over the mysteries; in that case, his son
Immarados (who can be equated with Ismaros) was the victim of Erechtheus.211 Eumolpos
is quite often described as the founder of the Eleusinian Mysteries in later sources212 (although
some mythographers claimed that there were two ﬁgures of that name, the one who founded
the mysteries and the one who made war against Athens at a later period213). It was some-
times said that the Athenians invited Ion to act as their military commander during their
war against Eumolpos.
The above-mentioned story of the death of the daughters of Erechtheus provided a myth-
ical explanation for the origin of the HYAKINTHIDES, a group of heroines or minor
goddesses who were honoured in Attic cult. There was an alternative story in which the
Hyakinthides were said to have originated as the four daughters of a Spartan called
Hyakinthos (not to be confused with the celebrated favourite of Apollo) who had settled in
Attica; for when Attica had been struck by a famine and plague during the war with Minos
(see p. 341), the Athenians had slaughtered the daughters of Hyakinthos on the grave of
Geraistos the Kyklops (otherwise unknown) in obedience to an ancient oracle. On this occa-
sion, as we have seen, the sacriﬁce failed to achieve its purpose.214 It could be explained in
this story that the Hyakinthides were known by that name because they had been the daugh-
ters of Hyakinthos. In the other story in which they had originated as the daughters of
— Legends of Crete and Athens —
370

Erechtheus, it was explained that they had come to be known as the Hyakinthides because
they had died on a hill called Hyakinthos.215 If all the daughters of Erechtheus met their
death in the above circumstances, this story is not easily reconciled with the forthcoming
traditions in which the daughters of Erechtheus are said to have contracted splendid
marriages.
The daughters of Erechtheus, and the legend of Kephalos 
and Prokris
Two of the daughters of Erechtheus led unexceptional lives, CHTHONIA marrying
her uncle Boutes,216 and KREOUSA marrying Xouthos, son of Hellen, to become
the mother of Ion and Achaios (see p. 406). Euripides provides Kreousa with a more
eventful history in his unconventional account in the Ion however, by suggesting
that she bore Ion to Apollo before her marriage, abandoned him in a cave under
the Acropolis, and later came close to murdering him when Xouthos adopted him
at the order of the Delphic oracle (see further on pp. 407–8).
OREITHUIA was carried away by Boreas, the North Wind, while she was playing
by the banks of the Ilissos just outside Athens; the pretty and secluded site of the
incident is described in Plato’s Phaedrus. There were also accounts in which she was
seized from the Acropolis or Aeiopagos. As Plato remarks, the myth could easily be
rationalized if it was imagined that she had been blown from a height by a gust of
wind. Boreas carried her north to his chilly home in Thrace, where she bore him
twin sons, Zetes and Kalais, known as the Boreads (Boreadai), and also two
daughters, Chione (Snow-woman), who bore Eumolpos to Poseidon (see above), and
Kleopatra, who became the ﬁrst wife of the Thracian seer Phineus (see p. 386).217
The Boreads were winged beings who could ﬂy through the air like their divine
father; for the famous myth of their pursuit of the Harpies, see p. 387. The Athenians
were proud to have a special relationship with Boreas, who was supposed to have
come to their aid in more than one moment of peril. When they were under threat
from the Persian ﬂeet in 480 BC, an oracle advised them to ‘call on the aid of their
son-in-law’; and since Boreas had taken an Athenian princess as his wife, they offered
sacriﬁces to him and his consort. He duly responded by blowing up a savage storm
which destroyed a great many Persian ships as they were lying in an exposed position
off southern Thessaly. A comparable stroke of good fortune twelve years earlier when
the ﬂeet of Darios was struck by a storm off Athos was also attributed to the good
services of the wind-god.218 Stories of this kind doubtless contributed to the popu-
larity of the local legend of Oreithuia’s abduction, which is depicted very frequently
and often very strikingly in Athenian vase-paintings.
PROKRIS, the remaining daughter of Erechtheus, married KEPHALOS, a son of
Deion (or Deioneus), son of Aiolos (see p. 435), from Central Greece, and lived with
him in the country outside Athens. There are several conﬂicting accounts of their
troubled marriage. In the earliest surviving narrative by Pherecydes, Kephalos
subjected her to a bizarre test soon after their wedding by abandoning her for eight
years and then returning in disguise to see whether he could seduce her by offering
her some ﬁnery; but although she yielded to the temptation, the two of them patched
up their differences and resumed their married life. She later came to suspect that

he was seeing another woman because he was absent so much of the time on hunting-
trips. When she questioned a servant on the matter, he conﬁrmed her suspicions by
telling her that he had seen his master on a hilltop calling out repeatedly, 
‘Come here, Nephele!’ Supposing that he had been summoning a woman called
Nephele (Cloud), even though he had really been calling for shade from the sun,
Prokris concealed herself on the same hill to spy on his actions; and when he 
called out once again just as the servant had described, she jumped up and ran to
confront him, giving him such a start that he hurled his spear by force of instinct
and killed her.219
In subsequent accounts, Prokris is often said to have left home for a time after
her husband caught her committing an inﬁdelity or trapped her into doing so.
According to Apollodorus, a certain Pteleon won his way into her bed by offering
her a golden crown, and she sought refuge with Minos in Crete after her husband
found out. Minos fell in love with her and was eager to seduce her; but his wife
Pasiphae had become so exasperated by his inﬁdelities that she had put a spell on
him, causing him to ejaculate wild beasts (snakes, scorpions and millipedes according
to another source) if he ever slept with another woman, with fatal effect on her. In
return for two precious gifts, however, a swift dog and a marvellous hunting-spear
that always hit its mark, Prokris found a cure for his malady by giving him a
wonderful potion containing the ‘Kirkaian root’, and then went to bed with him.
Fearing the jealousy of Pasiphae, she returned to Athens afterwards, taking the gifts
with her, and reached an accommodation with her husband. She liked to go hunting
with him, for she was as fond of hunting as he was; and as she was pursuing some
game through the thicket one day, Kephalos hurled his javelin (presumably the
unfailing one from Crete) without realizing that it was her, and struck her dead.
He was tried for murder as a consequence at the court of the Areiopagos, and was
condemned to perpetual exile (rather than to death as would have been the case if
the killing had been deliberate). He chose to settle at Thebes.220 Or in an account
from a poem in the epic cycle, he went to Thebes to be puriﬁed after committing
the involuntary killing, and was thus available to allow the wonderful dog from
Crete to be used against the Teumessian fox (see p. 246).221 This would suggest
that the tale of Prokris’ journey to Crete may have been quite ancient; it may be
signiﬁcant that a Prokris should be mentioned by Homer in the company of Phaidra
and Ariadne (both daughters of Minos) among the women who were seen by
Odysseus in the Underworld.222 Prokris’ death-story ﬁrst appears in the visual arts
in the second half of the ﬁfth century BC.
A further complication was introduced into the story if the present Kephalos is
identiﬁed with the Kephalos who was abducted by Eos (properly a wholly different
person, a son of Hermes and Herse, see p. 366, rather than a son of Deion). It seems
likely that this was an innovation introduced by Nicander. We may start with 
the familiar account in Ovid’s Metamorphoses before passing on to that recorded 
by Antoninus, which probably follows Nicander more closely (although no source
is indicated). The dawn-goddess abducted Kephalos two months after his marriage, 
so Ovid relates, but he yearned so passionately for his wife that the goddess 
soon lost patience with him and sent him back to her. In her anger at being scorned,
— Legends of Crete and Athens —
372

however, Eos encouraged him to doubt the ﬁdelity of his wife, and transformed 
his appearance to enable him to test her in the guise of a stranger. By promising
her a fortune in return for her favours, he brought her to the point of yielding and
then revealed his true identity. Overcome by shame, and feeling resentment at the
male sex on account of his underhand behaviour, she left home in shame to wander
the hills as a huntress. Finding that he was tormented by love in her absence, 
he ﬁnally sought a reconciliation, confessing that he too might have yielded to such
a temptation. So she returned to him, bringing two marvellous gifts, a swift-running
dog and a wonderful spear that she had received from Artemis. Rather as in the
story from Pherecydes above, she was later told that Kephalos was in the habit 
of calling out for Aura while out hunting, and inferred from this that he was 
meeting with a nymph of that name (although he was really calling for a cooling
breeze, as aura can mean in both Greek and Latin). So she hid herself in the hunting-
ﬁeld to spy on him, and when he heard her in the undergrowth, he hurled 
his unerring spear in that direction in the belief that a wild animal was hiding
there.223
Antoninus’ account follows a similar course initially, except that Kephalos asked
one of his friends to test the virtue of his wife after his temporary abduction. After
refusing a ﬁrst offer of gold, she agreed to sleep with the stranger when he doubled
the bribe, and was duly caught by her husband when she arrived for the assigna-
tion. She abandoned him in shame and sought refuge with Minos in Crete. As in
Apollodorus’ version above, she won his favour by helping him to overcome his
strange sexual problem; but in this account, he was distressed by it because it was
preventing him from fathering children by his wife (rather than from sleeping 
with other women). Prokris contrived a mechanical solution by inserting a goat’s
bladder into a woman’s vagina and causing him to discharge the snakes, scorpions
and millipedes into it before he had intercourse with his wife. On ﬁnding that he
was able to father children by her as a consequence, he rewarded Prokris by giving
her the infallible dog and hunting-spear. She now returned to Attica and put
Kephalos himself to the test. Cutting her hair short and changing into male clothing,
she approached him in the guise of a young man and showed him the wonderful
dog and spear; and he coveted them so greatly that he agreed to submit to the
stranger in homosexual intercourse as the price for acquiring them. Prokris then
revealed her true identity and accused him of having committed an even worse fault
than her own. Antoninus concludes by telling how the dog was used against the
Teumessian fox without making any reference to the death of Prokris.224
We may conclude with a related account offered by Hyginus. Eos accosted
Kephalos while he was out hunting one morning, but he rejected her, saying that
he had sworn to remain faithful to his wife. So the goddess transformed his appear-
ance and gave him some beautiful gifts to enable him to test whether his wife was
as faithful as he was. Prokris was caught out in the usual way and ﬂed to Crete,
where she sought to join the hunting-party of Artemis; but she was turned away
because the goddess accepted virgins alone as her companions. On hearing Prokris’
story, however, Artemis felt sorry for her, and gave her the unfailing dog and 
spear and sent her off to test Kephalos. She achieved this in the same way as in the

preceding version. The couple resumed their married life now that the wrongs were
balanced out, and all might have been well if Prokris had not feared that her husband
might be meeting Eos in secret. As she was spying on him from some bushes at
daybreak one morning, he saw them stirring and killed her unknowingly by hurling
his unfailing javelin.225
The last kings of Athens
To return to the highly artiﬁcial history of the Athenian succession that was devel-
oped by the Atthidographers, Erechtheus was succeeded by his son KEKROPS II,
who either inherited the throne as the eldest son or was awarded it through the
arbitration of Xouthos, son of Hellen (see p. 406).226 This second Kekrops, a
nonentity who was invented for chronological reasons, was succeeded by his son,
PANDION II, who was soon forced into exile by his cousins the sons of Metion. 
He sought refuge with Pylas, the king of the neighbouring province of Megara, who
offered him his daughter, Pylia, as a wife. When Pylas himself was later obliged to
depart into exile after killing his uncle, he transferred the kingdom to his Athenian
son-in-law. While in Megara, Pandion fathered four sons, Aigeus, Pallas, Nisos and
Lykos, who reconquered Athens after his death and banished the usurpers. Although
the four brothers agreed to divide the kingdom, AIGEUS held all the power, to the
increasing discontent of PALLAS, who later mounted a revolt with the aid of his 
ﬁfty sons, but was defeated by Theseus (see pp. 356–7).227 LYKOS, who was cred-
ited with prophetic powers, was the eponymous ancestor of the Lykomides, an
important priestly clan at Athens; he was ﬁnally expelled by Aigeus and either settled
in Messenia with Aphareus (see p. 422), whom he instructed in the mysteries of
Demeter and Persephone, or else in Lycia in Asia Minor, hence the name of that land
(see p. 350).228 NISOS was usually said to have ruled in Megara as his father’s
successor;229 he was betrayed by his daughter Skylla when Minos attacked Megara
and Athens (see p. 340).
The adventures of Aigeus and Theseus, as described above, ﬁnally take us into
the realm of major heroic myth. For reasons that have already been considered,
Theseus was displaced towards the end of his life by MENESTHEUS, son of Peteos,
who could claim to rule with some legitimacy since he was descended from
Erechtheus through a side-branch of the Athenian royal family. Since Theseus was
absent in the Underworld when Menestheus seized power, his two sons, Demophon
and Akamas, had to see to their own safety and sought refuge in Euboea with
Elephenor, king of the Abantes. Menestheus is an ancient ﬁgure who appears in the
Iliad as the leader of the Athenian contingent at Troy, and is listed among the
suitors of Helen in the Hesiodic Catalogue.230 Although Homer remarks that nobody
could equal him, and Nestor alone could rival him, in the marshalling of chariots
and ﬁghting men, he is by no means prominent in the Iliad, making only a few
brief appearances in the battle-scenes.231 Either because he was killed in the ﬁghting
at Troy or because he settled on Melos or in Italy or even Iberia afterwards, he failed
to return home after the war, leaving the way open for one or both of the sons of
Theseus to recover their ancestral throne.232
— Legends of Crete and Athens —
374

Theseus died in exile before the Trojan War soon after his escape from the
Underworld (see p. 362). Although his sons DEMOPHON and AKAMAS are never
mentioned in the Homeric epics, it is known that they appeared in two later epics
in the Trojan cycle, the Little Iliad and the Sack of Troy, which told how they recov-
ered their grandmother Aithra at the end of the war. According to the standard
later tradition, they sailed to Troy towards the end of the war for that speciﬁc
purpose. As was explained above, Aithra had been captured by the Dioskouroi when
they came to Attica to recover Helen after she was abducted by Theseus (see 
p. 361), and had been obliged to serve Helen as a maidservant thereafter, initially
at Sparta and later at Troy. When Troy ﬁnally fell to the Greeks, her grandsons
sought her out in the city or discovered her among the captives in the Greek camp,
and asked Agamemnon to allow them to take her home to Athens.233 There was
disagreement as to whether both came to rule at Athens or – as was more commonly
credited – one alone did; it was generally explained in the post-classical tradition
that one or other of them lost his life after becoming entangled with a Thracian
princess on the way home.
This princess was PHYLLIS, the daughter of the king of the Bisaltians (or
Edonians) of south-western Thrace. In Apollodorus’ account, she fell in love with
Demophon when he called in at her land, and her father gave her to him as a wife
with the kingdom as a dowry. He wanted to sail to his own land after a while,
however, and set off on his way in spite of her pleadings, fending her off by swearing
that he would return to her in due course. She accompanied him to the shore at
Nine Ways and gave him a casket, telling him that it contained an object sacred
to Mother Rhea, and that he was not to open it unless he had abandoned all hope
of returning to her. When the appointed time for his return passed by, Phyllis
cursed him and killed herself; and when her faithless husband, who had settled in
Cyprus for some reason, opened the casket, he was overcome by a sudden terror and
leapt on to his horse and galloped away, riding at such reckless speed that he was
thrown off and fell on to his sword.234 Akamas sometimes replaces Demophon in
other accounts of this story; it is indeed likely that he was the original husband of
Phyllis, since he is mentioned in this role before his brother and had early connec-
tions with Thrace. Aeschines, an Athenian orator of the fourth century BC, states
that he received the town of Nine Ways (Ennea Hodoi) as his dowry.235 This was
the original name of Amphipolis, a town on the Thracian coast that was seized and
colonized by the Athenians in 437 BC; some claimed that it had been called Nine
Ways because Phyllis ran down to the shore at that spot nine times on the day on
which her husband was due to return.236 A lost account by Callimachus seems to
have helped to establish the popularity of the tale.237
The name of Phyllis (which was in fact derived from the name of a district in Thrace) bears
a resemblance to the Greek word for leaves, and her legend was thus adapted to explain
why leaves were known as phylla. The trees that sprang up by Phyllis’ tomb used to weep
for her each year on the anniversary of her death by shedding their leaves, which came to
be named after her as a consequence;238 or after her suicide, Phyllis was transformed into
an almond-tree which had no leaves initially, but brought them forth for the ﬁrst time when
her deceiver (Demophon in this case) embraced the trunk of the tree after making a belated
return.239

According to a tale of Hellenistic origin, Akamas fathered a child by LAODIKE, an
unmarried daughter of Priam, when he travelled to Troy with Diomedes just before the war
to try to negotiate the return of Helen. After falling desperately in love with him, Laodike
arranged for him to be invited to a banquet at Dardanos, a town in the Troad, and slipped
into his bed afterwards, pretending to be one of Priam’s concubines. She bore him a son,
MOUNITOS, who was brought up by his great-grandmother Aithra. Mounitos was united
with his father after the fall of Troy and set off for Athens with him, but died of a snake-
bite during a hunting-trip when they called in at Thrace on the way. For the more
conventional mythology of Laodike, see p. 480.240
There was a tradition that suggested that Demophon and Akamas served at Troy with
Elephenor and his Euboeans, presumably after setting out with them at the beginning of
the conﬂict.241
If Demophon came to rule at Athens, he was succeeded by son Oxyntes and thence
his grandson THYMOITES, who was the last descendant of Erichthonios and
Theseus to rule at Athens.242 During the reign of Thymoites, a war broke out
between Attica and Boeotia, and the Boeotians proposed that the outcome should
be determined by single combat between the kings of the two lands; but Thymoites,
who was none too brave, was unwilling to take the risk, and offered to surrender
the throne to anyone who was willing to ﬁght the duel on his behalf. The chal-
lenge was taken up by MELANTHOS, a descendant of Neleus who had been expelled
from Pylos by the Heraklids along with the rest of his family (see p. 290 for the
circumstances) and had been advised by oracles to settle at Athens. He won the
ﬁght by means of a ruse. For as he was drawing close to Xanthios (or Xanthos), the
king of Boeotia, he accused him of having cheated by bringing a second; and when
the king looked back in astonishment to see if anyone was really following him,
Melanthos hurled his spear at him and struck him dead. It was claimed that the
Athenians celebrated their victory by founding their annual festival of the Apatouria,
which could thus be said to recall his deception (apate¯) in its name.243 A secondary
version removes the deception by alleging that Melanthos called out to his oppo-
nent because he saw a phantom walking behind him. Or according to a wholly
different tradition, he seized power at Athens by killing Thymoites.244
Melanthos was succeeded by his son KODROS, who was usually thought to have
been the last king of Athens. During his reign, Aletes, the ﬁrst Heraklid ruler of
Corinth (see p. 290), marched against the city with a Dorian army after receiving
an oracle that promised him victory if the Athenian king were not harmed. Kodros
came to hear of the oracle, however, and sacriﬁced his own life for the sake of his
city by entering the enemy camp disguised as a woodcutter and provoking one of
the troops to kill him. As soon as the Dorians discovered his true identity, they
abandoned all hope of victory and withdrew; and the Athenians decided to have no
more kings after Kodros as a tribute to his incomparable patriotism. So his son
Medon became the ﬁrst archon (senior magistrate) of Athens, or at least a ruler with
restricted powers.245 For Medon’s quarrel with his brother Neileus, and the Ionian
migration to Asia Minor that resulted from it, see p. 409.

JASON AND THE 
ARGONAUTS

A
part from the Theban Wars, which have been considered in connection with
the history of the Inachids, there were two other great adventures in the period
before the Trojan War that drew leading heroes from different parts of Greece,
namely the voyage of the Argonauts and the hunt for the Calydonian boar. The
fathers of many Homeric warriors can be found among the heroes who took part in
these two enterprises, which can be traced to a slightly earlier period than the
Theban Wars and involved a much wider range of participants. If the Theban Wars
broke out as the result of a conﬂict within the Inachid family, these other adven-
tures were connected with the Deukalionids, the next great family that we will have
to consider, for they were conducted under Deukalionid leadership in response to
difﬁculties that had arisen in different branches of that family. Although the early
epic accounts of the Argonautic expedition have been lost as in the case of the
Theban Wars (and also the boar-hunt), we know far more about it than about the
other episodes, largely because an epic from the Hellenistic era, the Argonautica of
Apollonius of Rhodes, has survived in full along with scholia (ancient explanatory
notes) that provide invaluable information on the earlier tradition and Argonautic
lore in general. Since the history of the Deukalionids is exceptionally complicated
and the mythology of the Argonauts is so rich and of such wide interest, it will be
best to single out the latter for separate treatment in the present chapter before we
pass on to trace the full history of the Deukalionids in the next chapter.
The origin of the golden ﬂeece
The myth of the Argonauts told how Jason, son of Aison, set off with a crew of
ﬁfty heroes to fetch a golden ﬂeece from Colchis at the eastern end of the Black Sea
at the order of his uncle, Pelias, king of Iolkos. Before passing on to the expedi-
tion itself, we must consider the origin and nature of the object of Jason’s quest,
and the motives of Pelias in sending him off on this perilous enterprise.
The golden ﬂeece had come from a wondrous ram that had carried a young
Boeotian prince, PHRIXOS, to safety in Colchis after his stepmother had plotted
to cause his death. His father ATHAMAS, whom we have already encountered as
a foster-parent of the infant Dionysos (see p. 172), was famed for his tangled marital

affairs, which will be discussed further in the next chapter (see pp. 420ff.). According
to the usual tradition, he ﬁrst married NEPHELE (Cloud, apparently a minor
goddess), who bore him two children, Phrixos and Helle; but he later put her aside
(or was deserted by her) and remarried, taking INO, a daughter of Kadmos, king
of Thebes, as his new wife. As is the manner of stepmothers in folklore, Ino resented
the children whom he had fathered by his previous wife, and hated them indeed so
very greatly that she set out to contrive their death. On the pretence no doubt that
it would serve as a helpful charm, she persuaded the women of the land to roast
the coming year’s seed-corn over ﬁre in secret from the men; and when the grain
failed to germinate as a result of this treatment, Athamas reacted as she had fore-
seen by sending an envoy (or envoys) to Delphi to seek the advice of the oracle.
Intercepting the envoy (or envoys) on the way, she bribed him (or them) to report
to the king that the oracle had revealed that the famine would be brought to an
end if Phrixos (and his sister Helle too in some accounts) were sacriﬁced to Zeus.
Although Athamas was naturally reluctant to order the death of his son, he ﬁnally
agreed to do so at the insistence of his people; or in another version, Phrixos resolved
the matter on his behalf by volunteering to be sacriﬁced for the common good. As
he was being brought to the altar, however, his mother Nephele intervened by
bringing or sending a golden-ﬂeeced ram which carried him to safety on its back.
This was a marvellous beast that had been given to her by Hermes and was able to
ﬂy through the sky.1 It took Helle in addition to her brother whether or not she
was due to be sacriﬁced, soaring up into the air with them and heading for the east.
As it was approaching Asia, however, Helle lost her grip and fell into the narrow
straits that separate Europe from Asia, which were therefore known as the Hellespont
(Sea of Helle) from that time onwards.2 Phrixos for his part was carried ever further
until the ram alighted in the land of Colchis at the eastern end of the Black Sea.
In gratitude for his deliverance, he sacriﬁced the ram to Zeus Phyxios (God of
Escape), and then presented its golden ﬂeece to the local ruler, AIETES.3
Aietes was a son of Helios (the Sun) by the Okeanid Perse or Perseis, and a brother
of the enchantress Kirke.4 Although he was a cold-hearted despot who was not
usually friendly to strangers, he was impressed by the wonderful gift of the ﬂeece
and welcomed Phrixos to his court, offering him his daughter Chalkiope (or Iophossa)
as a wife. Phrixos fathered four sons by her, Argos, Melas, Phrontis and Kytisoros,5
and lived without further adventure in Colchis until he died of old age.6 In the
Argonautic epic of Apollonius, as we will see, his sons set off for Greece when they
were old enough in the hope of recovering their grandfather’s inheritance, but were
shipwrecked on an island in the Black Sea, where they remained until Jason picked
them up and brought them back to Colchis.7 Since Aietes had been warned by his
divine father to beware of treachery from within his own family, he was highly
suspicious when he saw them arriving in the company of strangers, and this was
one of the reasons why he bore such malice against the Argonauts.8 He was noted
for his harsh and distrustful nature in any case; according to Apollonius, indeed, he
would never have accepted Phrixos into his court in the ﬁrst place if Hermes had
not come to warn him that this was the will of Zeus.9
The king dedicated the golden ﬂeece to Ares, suspending it on an oak-tree in the
grove of Ares near his city of Aia, where it was guarded by an unsleeping dragon.10
— Jason and the Argonauts —
378

Or in other accounts, Phrixos hung it up in the temple of Ares in the city,11 or it
was kept in the palace of Aietes,12 or deposited on the island of Aia in the river
Phasis.13 The ram itself ﬂew up to the heavens, or was transferred there by Nephele,
to become the constellation of the Ram (Aries); since the ram had been deprived of
its gleaming coat, this constellation, the ﬁrst in the zodiac, is extremely faint.14
This story of the origin of the ﬂeece varies to a greater or lesser extent in different versions.
In one account of the events in Boeotia, for instance, the envoy who brought the false message
to Athamas felt such pity for Phrixos when he saw him being led out to sacriﬁce that he
betrayed Ino’s plot to the king at the last moment. On learning of his wife’s treachery,
Athamas ordered that she and her son Melikertes should be put to death; but Dionysos, who
owed a debt to Ino for having nursed him during his infancy, saved her by casting a mist
around her.15 In what was apparently a continuation of the same story, Dionysos sent Phrixos
and Helle mad, but they were rescued as usual by their mother Nephele, who brought the
golden-ﬂeeced ram to them as they were wandering through a forest in a state of frenzy.16 In
another version of the myth, Phrixos and Helle were hurled into the sea instead of being taken
to an altar, but were saved by the ram in much the same manner as usual.17 There are also
versions in which Zeus sent the ram to prevent the unholy sacriﬁce from being fulﬁlled,18
or the ram spoke to Phrixos and Helle in a human voice to warn them that they were due to
be sacriﬁced and told them to climb on to its back.19 Rationalistic versions explain that the
ram was really a ship which had a ram as its ﬁgure-head,20 or a man called Krios (Ram) 
who was the steward of Athamas or childhood attendant (paidago¯gos) of Phrixos.21 Helle was
sometimes said to have been rescued by Poseidon after falling into the Hellespont; in that case
she bore him a son nearby named variously as Edonos (the eponym of the Edones of Thrace),
or Paion (the eponym of Paionia, a region in northern Macedonia; but see also p. 412), or the
giant Almops (the eponym of an district in Macedonia).22
Hyginus recounts a rather foolish tale, doubtless of Hellenistic origin, that was devised to
explain the origin of the golden-ﬂeeced ram. A certain THEOPHANE, daughter of Bisaltes
(or perhaps simply a Bisaltian of Thrace in the original account), aroused the love of Poseidon,
who carried her off to the island of Crumissa (sic, of unknown location). When her suitors
subsequently sailed off to recover her, Poseidon turned himself into a ram, his mistress into a
beautiful ewe, and the people of the island into cattle. On ﬁnding that the island was deserted,
the suitors began to kill the newly transformed islanders for food, provoking Poseidon to turn
them into wolves; and Poseidon then mated with Theophane in animal-form, causing her to
conceive the marvellous ram.23 Ovid seems to have been acquainted with this story in some
form at least, for he mentions in passing that Poseidon once ‘deceived Bisaltis with a ram’.24
According to Apollonius, the ram had golden ﬂeece because Hermes (who was often said to
have given the beast to Nephele) had turned it to gold.25
Although Apollonius states that Phrixos died of old age, another account suggests that
Aietes eventually killed him after receiving prophetic warning that he should fear death at
the hand of a foreigner descended from Aiolos.26 After being shipwrecked and rescued by
the Argonauts when they ﬁrst tried to sail to Greece, the sons of Phrixos reached their ances-
tral homeland by accompanying the Argonauts on their return voyage.27 It is reported in
one tradition that Argos, son of Phrixos, married Perimele, daughter of Admetos, to become
the father of Magnes,28 the eponym of Magnesia (but see also p. 436). If this Argos is iden-
tiﬁed as the Argos who built the Argo, as in Pherecydes’ account29 though not in most others
(see p. 382), he must obviously have been in Greece before the Argonauts sailed. Herodotus
may be consulted for a legend in which Kytisoros, another son of Phrixos, rescued his grand-
father Athamas when the citizens of Alos in Thessalian Achaea were about to sacriﬁce him
as a scapegoat.30

How Jason came to be sent on his quest
Phrixos’ adventure with the ram would provide the Argonauts with a suitable object
for their quest. To understand why Pelias, king of Iolkos, should have asked his
nephew Jason to undertake the perilous mission of fetching the golden ﬂeece from
Colchis, it is necessary to consider the earlier history of Iolkos and its ruling family.
This Thessalian city, which lay near the coast at the head of the Gulf of Pagasai,
was founded by Kretheus, a son of Aiolos and great-grandson of Deukalion (see
further on p. 425). Kretheus married his niece Tyro and fathered three sons by her
including Aison, who might have expected to succeed him in normal circumstances
as the eldest; but it happened that Tyro had borne twin sons to Poseidon before
her marriage, and one of these, Pelias, succeeded to the Iolkian throne instead,
excluding Aison and his son Jason from the inheritance.31
PELIAS came to be born and rose to power in the following circumstances. When
Zeus destroyed Salmoneus along with his entire city (see p. 422), he spared his
young daughter TYRO and entrusted her to the care of Kretheus in Thessaly; and
after arriving in her new homeland, Tyro conceived a passion for a local river-god,
Enipeus, and used to linger by his waters, telling him of her love. Her behaviour
attracted the attention of a much greater god, Poseidon, who seduced her in the
guise of Enipeus and had intercourse with her by the river-bank, causing a huge
wave to arch overhead to conceal them from sight. As the product of this union,
she bore him twin sons, Pelias and Neleus.32 According to the earliest account in
the Odyssey, from which the preceding description of the episode is taken, Poseidon
ordered her to rear the children herself; but in the standard later tradition, she was
said to have exposed them at birth. They were rescued by some countrymen, as
heroic children always are in such circumstances, in this case by some horse-breeders,
who gave Pelias his name because a horse had kicked him in the face just before,
leaving a black-and-blue (pelion) mark.33 Some said that they were suckled by animals
until they were discovered, Pelias by a mare and Neleus by a bitch.34 Sophocles
seems to have offered a rather different account in his lost Tyro, saying that the
twins were set aﬂoat in a container of some kind (skaphe¯) on the river, much like
Romulus and Remus at Rome (see p. 596).35 When the twins grew up, they redis-
covered their mother and rescued her from her stepmother Sidero (Iron-woman),
who had been cruelly mistreating her in the mean time. Although Sidero is some-
times described as the second wife of Tyro’s father Salmoneus,36 it would make more
sense to assume that she was the ﬁrst wife of Kretheus, during the period while he
was still acting as guardian to Tyro before taking her as his wife. Pelias killed Sidero
in any case, and in circumstances that would have a bearing on the story of the
Argonauts; for he slaughtered her at an altar of Hera after she had taken sanctuary
there, and compounded the fault by ceasing to honour Hera thereafter.37 Hera hated
him as a consequence and did her best to help Jason and the Argonauts; and in one
early version of the story, as we will see, she even contrived that Pelias should send
Jason on his mission in the ﬁrst place because she knew that this would ultimately
cause Pelias’ own destruction.
The two brothers quarrelled after a time, and Pelias drove Neleus out of Thessaly,
causing him to seek refuge in Messenia (see p. 424).38 He remained at Iolkos for
— Jason and the Argonauts —
380

his own part, where he would have enjoyed an honoured position as stepson of the
founder after his mother’s marriage to Kretheus; and he succeeded to the throne
after the death of Kretheus even though the king had fathered sons of his own by
Tyro. The fact that Pelias came to rule the city instead of Aison, the eldest son of
Kretheus, need not necessarily imply that he seized the throne illegitimately, for
sons who are borne to gods by the wives of kings in legend can be regarded as legit-
imate heirs of those kings; and in one early version of Pelias’ legend at least, Aison
and Jason laid no claim to his throne, and Hera contrived that he should send Jason
for the ﬂeece for reasons of her own. We will begin with this version, as known
primarily from a surviving passage from Pherecydes and the corresponding narra-
tive of Apollodorus (which seems to be based on that of Pherecydes). Pelias reigned
as Kretheus’ successor in Jason’s home-city of Iolkos, but Jason preferred to live
outside in the country because he had a passion for agriculture. There is no reason
to suppose that he feared for his safety as in the other main version of the story in
which (as we will see) his parents sent him into the country at birth as a protec-
tive measure. When he returned to Iolkos to have his fateful meeting with Pelias,
it was to attend a sacriﬁce in response to a general summons from the king rather
than with the intention of taking any action against him. For when Pelias was once
intending to offer a sacriﬁce to Poseidon by the sea-shore, he summoned all the citi-
zens to attend, including Jason, who received the message as he was ploughing his
ﬁelds beside the river Anauros. He took off his sandals to cross the river, but forgot
to put his left sandal on again when he arrived at the opposite bank side (or else
lost it in the current). Now Pelias had once received an oracle warning him to
beware of the man with a single sandal; and when he saw Jason arrive at the cere-
mony with one foot bare, he called the prophecy to mind and was thoroughly
alarmed. So he invited Jason to the palace on the following day and asked him what
he would do if he had been told by an oracle that he would be murdered by one
of his fellow-citizens. At the inspiration of Hera, who had long hated Pelias for
reasons already explained, Jason immediately replied that he would send him to
fetch the golden ﬂeece; for the goddess put this thought into his mind because she
knew that if he were sent on that mission, he would return with the Colchian
enchantress Medeia who would cause the death of Pelias (see p. 397). Pelias assumed,
however, that such a quest would bring death to anyone who attempted it, and sent
Jason on his way without hesitation.39
In the most familiar form of the legend, Pelias was a brutal tyrant who ﬁrst
robbed Aison of his rightful throne and later tried to cause the death of Jason when
he arrived to reclaim it; we will follow the earliest surviving account in Pindar’s
fourth Pythian Ode. To ensure that the new-born Jason would be safe from Pelias,
his parents pretended that he had died at birth and sent him away in secret at night
while making a show of lamentation, wrapping the infant in purple robes as beﬁtted
a royal prince. They entrusted him to the care of the Centaur Cheiron, who lived
in a cave on Mt Pelion to the east. We should doubtless assume that Jason was
reared by Cheiron in the preceding version too. Jason remained in hiding in the
country, unknown to Pelias or anyone outside his family circle, until he was twenty
years old, when he returned to Iolkos to demand the throne from Pelias. Now Pelias
had received two oracles, one telling him that death would come to him from a

descendant of Aiolos, and the other warning him to beware of the man who would
come down from the mountains wearing only a single sandal; so when Jason, who
was a great-grandson of Aiolos, appeared in the city wearing a single sandal and
demanded the throne, Pelias realized that he would have to contrive his removal
and destruction. Pretending that he was willing to surrender the throne, he asked
Jason to perform a special favour for him before taking over the kingdom; for he
claimed that Phrixos had appeared to him in a dream to ask that the golden ﬂeece
should be fetched home to Greece, and this was a task that was better suited to a
young man like Jason than an old man like himself. Jason readily agreed to under-
take the mission on his behalf, giving him reason to suppose that he had saved
himself from the threatened danger.40
Jason’s missing sandal is not explained by the river-crossing in Pindar’s version; it would
seem that he was deliberately wearing a sandal on one foot only in accordance with a prac-
tice that was sometimes adopted by Greek warriors (for this could make it easier for them
to gain a ﬁrm foothold on slippery ground).
There is a reference in the Theogony to ‘the many grievous labours’ that were imposed on
the son of Aison by Pelias (in the concluding section of the poem, however, which was added
after Hesiod’s time); although Pelias is described as violent and overbearing, nothing is stated
on his motive in imposing these labours.41 Since Mimnermus (late seventh century BC) refers
in similar terms to the grievous task that was set for Jason by the brutal (hybriste¯s) Pelias,42
it seems to have been agreed from early times that Pelias was a man of violent character.
It is suggested in some accounts that Aison succeeded his father Kretheus as king of Iolkos
but died prematurely, bequeathing the kingdom to Pelias on the understanding that he would
rule as regent until Jason came of age; but when Jason returned from the country as a young
man, Pelias sent him off to fetch the ﬂeece as usual to save himself from having to hand over
the throne (or because an oracle had warned him to beware of the one-sandalled man).43
Apollonius is very brisk in his account of the origin of Jason’s quest, merely stating that
he came to attend Pelias’ sacriﬁce, losing one of his sandals in the river Anauros on the way,
and was sent off on his voyage because the king had been warned by an oracle to beware
of the man with one sandal.44 It is reported elsewhere in the poem that Hera had a special
fondness for Jason as the result of an encounter by the Anauros; for she had once sat down
by the river in the guise of an old woman to test human righteousness, and Jason had felt
compassion for her as he was returning from a hunting-trip and had carried her through the
water on his shoulders.45
Jason prepared for his mission by organizing the construction of the greatest ship
that had ever been built, the Argo, and by summoning leading heroes from all parts
of Greece to accompany him on the voyage. The ‘Argo which is famous to all
(pasimelousa)’, as Homer already calls her,46 was said to have been the ﬁrst large
seagoing ship (although the ship that carried the ﬁfty Danaids to Argos, see p. 233,
would in fact have been built at an earlier stage in mythical history). She was usually
pictured as a ﬁfty-oared ship (pente¯kontoros), hence the usual number of her crew,
who were known as the Argonauts (Argonautai, i.e. sailors of the Argo). Using timber
cut on Mt Pelion nearby,47 Argos, son of Arestor (or of Polybos or Phrixos) built
her at Pagasai, the port of Iolkos, under the guidance of Athena. As a ﬁnishing
touch, the goddess ﬁtted an oracular timber into her bow; taken from the sacred
— Jason and the Argonauts —
382

oak at the oracle of Zeus at Dodona, it was endowed with the power of speech 
(see p. 394).48 Ancient authors explain that the ship was called the Argo because
she was so swift (argos, doubtless the true origin of the name) or in honour of her
builder Argos.49
The myth of the Argonauts was extremely ancient and underwent many changes
in the course of time. It seems likely that Jason would have been accompanied by
a crew of Minyans (legendary inhabitants of his own region) in the earliest tradi-
tion, and that the voyage of the Argonauts would have taken them into a purely
mythical realm at the eastern edges of the earth. As time progressed, however, and
the Greeks became better acquainted with the lands and seas to the east of them,
the geography became less fanciful, and Colchis, a real land at the eastern end of
the Black Sea, replaced the mythical land of Aia as the destination of Jason’s quest;
and in due course, the adventure was developed into a panhellenic enterprise
involving heroes from far beyond Jason’s home in north-eastern Greece.
To recruit worthy companions to sail with him in the Argo, Jason sent messen-
gers to every corner of Greece to summon ﬁfty of the foremost heroes of the age.
These would have been men who reached their maturity a generation or so before
the Trojan War, and many were fathers of great warriors who fought at Troy. As
is commonly the case with collaborative enterprises in legend, no two lists are in
full agreement on the names of the participants; since the Argonauts generally acted
as a collective body (in surviving accounts at least) and few were remembered for
any individual exploits, plausible names from the appropriate era could be suggested
almost at will by poets and mythographers. The earliest useful information is
provided by Pindar, who identiﬁes ten Argonauts in addition to Jason himself and
the seer Mopsos, evidently choosing from those who had been fathered by gods,
namely Herakles, the two Dioskouroi, Zetes and Kalais (the Boreads, the twin sons
of Boreas, god of the north wind), Euphemos and Periklymenos (two sons of Poseidon
from the Peloponnese), Orpheus, and two heroes of lesser note, Echion and Eurytos,
who were twin sons of Hermes from Alope in Thessaly.50 Although fuller lists would
surely have been provided in early epic, and are reported to have been provided in
lost plays by Aeschylus and Sophocles, the earliest catalogue to survive is that offered
at the beginning of Apollonius’ Argonautic epic, which lists ﬁfty-ﬁve Argonauts.51
The catalogues offered by subsequent authors seem to be largely derived from this
with varying degrees of alteration, with the exception of that of Apollodorus, which
was plainly of separate origin.52 From among the heroes who are to be found in
every catalogue and are not already named by Pindar, the following may be picked
out as being most worthy of note: Admetos, Akastos, son of Pelias, the Arcadian
Ankaios (see p. 544), the Samian Ankaios (see p. 573), Hylas (a favourite of Herakles,
see below), Idas and Lynkeus, the seer Idmon, Iphiklos, son of Phylakos, Kepheus,
son of Aleos, Meleagros, Menoitios, Polyphemos, son of Elatos, the helmsman
Tiphys, and Telamon.
The outward voyage of the Argonauts

of the Black Sea; accounts of their return journey were more varied. We will take

Apollonius’ Hellenistic epic as our guide for the outward journey, noting each
successive landfall.53
(i) After setting off from Pagasai and rounding Cape Sepias, they stopped at
Aphetai for two days before continuing on their way (an idea that arose because the
name of the place might suggest in Greek that it is a starting-point). Herakles was
sometimes said to have been left behind there (see below).54 (ii) They then skirted
northern Thessaly and the Chalkidike before sailing east across the open sea to
Lemnos, where they made their longest halt. There were no men on the island at
the time because they had all been killed by the women. For not long before,
Aphrodite had afﬂicted the women with an evil smell to punish them for having
neglected her cult, causing them to become so repulsive to their husbands that they
had driven them from their beds and replaced them with captive women from
Thrace; and the Lemnian women had been so enraged by this treatment that they
had conspired together to murder every man on the island in a single night. One
woman alone had broken the agreement, HYPSIPYLE, the daughter of the king
and present queen of the island, who had saved her aged father Thoas by secretly
sending him out to sea in a chest (or putting him on a ship, or hiding him away
in the palace). On seeing the Argo approaching their shore, the women armed them-
selves and poured down to the beach, fearing that they were under attack from the
Thracians; but the Argonauts sent their herald Aithalides to Hypsipyle to assure
her that they had no hostile intentions. So she convened an assembly, and the women
agreed to invite the Argonauts into their homes; for they realized that they would
need male protectors or at least male children to guard them from attack and provide
for them in their old age. Believing that the women were in difﬁculties because
their menfolk had settled abroad in Thrace, the Argonauts were happy to oblige
them and lived with them for a year, fathering many children. Jason stayed at the
palace with Hypsipyle, who bore him two sons, Thoas (or Nebrophonos) and Euneos.
As time progressed, however, and the Argonauts constantly postponed their depar-
ture from one day to another, Herakles, who had remained behind on the ship,
ﬁnally lost patience and urged his comrades to continue on their way.55
(iii) On the advice of Orpheus, they ﬁrst rowed northward to the island of
Samothrace to be initiated into the mysteries of the gods of Samothrace (see p. 220),
who protected sailors against the perils of the sea.56 This is of course a compara-
tively late episode. (iv) After this detour, they entered the Straits of the Hellespont
(Dardanelles) to make their way through to the Black Sea. They made their ﬁrst
landfall at Kyzikos on the Asian shore of the Propontis (Sea of Marmora), where
they enjoyed the hospitality of KYZIKOS, king of the Doliones. As they were
climbing a neighbouring mountain on the next morning to survey their route, the
Argo was attacked by the Gegeneis (Earthborn), a race of six-armed giants who lived
on the mountain; but Herakles, who had stayed on the ship with some of the younger
heroes, kept them at bay with his arrows, bringing many of them to the ground,
until the rest of the crew returned to complete the slaughter. By a stroke of ill-
fortune, the Argonauts were caught by adverse winds on the night after their
departure and were driven back to their starting-point; and when they jumped ashore
in the dark without realizing where they were, their former hosts mistook them for
enemies from Euboea and engaged them in battle. Many of the Doliones perished
— Jason and the Argonauts —
384

in the ﬁghting, including Kyzikos, who was killed unknowingly by Jason. In the
light of dawn, however, both sides discovered their tragic and irremediable error,
and joined together to mourn the death of the king.57
(v) Further along the southern shore of the Propontis, the Argonauts called in at
the land of the Mysians. While preparations were being made for a feast on that
evening, Herakles wandered off into a forest to ﬁnd some wood for a new oar, having
broken his original oar by rowing it with excessive force. On seeing a pine-tree that
would suit the purpose, he knocked it with his club to free it from the ground and
then pulled it up roots and all. He had been accompanied on the expedition by a
young favourite of his, HYLAS, son of Theiodamas or Keux, who also wandered off
on his own to fetch some water from a spring. He was destined never to return, for
the nymph of the spring was so enchanted by his youthful beauty that she pulled
him into the water to keep him for herself. Or in Theocritus’ account, he was seized
by three such nymphs as he leant over the pool to ﬁll his jar. His cries were heard
by one Argonaut alone, Polyphemos, son of Elatos, a Thessalian Lapith, who warned
Herakles that something had happened to his favourite; but although the two of
them searched all night, they were unable to ﬁnd any trace of him. Their comrades
sailed off at dawn without realizing that anything was amiss, and travelled some
distance before discovering that the crew was incomplete. A ﬁerce quarrel broke out
as a consequence, but the recriminations were soon brought to a halt by the appear-
ance of the sea-god Glaukos (see p. 221), who rose up from the waves alongside the
ship and announced that Herakles was fated to continue his labours and Polyphemos
was fated to found the Mysian city of Kios, while Hylas had become the husband
of the water-nymph who had seized him.58
According to Apollonius, Telamon tried to persuade the Argonauts to sail back to pick up
Herakles, but he was successfully opposed by Zetes and Kalais, the sons of Boreas. They
paid a heavy price for their words, for when Herakles later encountered them on Tenos as
they were returning from the funeral-games for Pelias, he killed them and buried them on
the island, marking their burial-mound with a pair of columns. It was said that one of these
columns would move in response to the blowing of the North Wind (Boreas).59 In some
accounts, however, the Boreads are said to have met their death during their pursuit of the
Harpies (see p. 387).
The legend of Hylas was rooted in local Mysian lore. As Apollonius remarks, the people
of the area used to conduct a ritual search for him, supposedly in fulﬁlment of an oath that
their ancestors had sworn to Herakles.60 The people would roam through the mountains in
a frenzy calling out for him at his festival each year, and sacriﬁces used to be offered to him
at the spring which he was supposed to have visited, where the priest would call his name
three times. He presumably originated as a minor god who disappeared and was then reborn
with the vegetation each year. ‘Shouting for Hylas’ was a proverbial phrase for a futile enter-
prise.61 According to Nicander, the nymphs transformed Hylas into an echo for fear that
Herakles would ﬁnd him among them, hence the echoes that would greet the ritual cries
of the priest.62
Herakles was a comparatively late addition to the crew of the Argo. Even when he was
included among the Argonauts, he was rarely said to have travelled the whole way, for no
exploits were recorded for him in connection with the winning of the ﬂeece, and he would
have tended to overshadow the traditional leader. Some claimed that he was left behind at
the very beginning because he was clumsy at rowing and broke the oars,63 or because the

oracular timber on the Argo announced that he was too heavy for the ship or too far supe-
rior to the rest of the crew;64 or else he was left behind by accident as he was fetching water
at Aphetai on the Thessalian coast.65 It could easily be explained on the other hand that he
never joined the expedition in the ﬁrst place because he was occupied with his labours or
serving his sentence as a slave of Omphale (see p. 274).66 Only in some novelistic accounts
from the Hellenistic period was Herakles said to have sailed all the way to Colchis and even
to have been the leader of the expedition.67
(vi) Before leaving the Propontis, the Argonauts called in at the land of the
Bebrycians (Bebrykes), who lived in the region of Chalkedon near the southern
entrance to the Bosporos. Their ruler AMYKOS, a son of Poseidon by the Bithynian
nymph Melia, was a violent rufﬁan who forced passing strangers to box with him
and killed them in the ring. On this occasion, however, the ﬁnest of all boxers,
Polydeukes (one of the Dioskouroi, see p. 526), was present to respond to the chal-
lenge and stepped forward with alacrity. So the two pugilists wrapped thongs of
leather around their hands in accordance with ancient practice, and then exchanged
punches until Polydeukes shattered the king’s skull with a blow above the ear. The
Bebrycians, who evidently had no sporting instincts, broke into the ring with their
clubs and spears, but were routed by the Argonauts after a brisk ﬁght.68
(vii) As the Argonauts were making their way into the Bosporos, a huge wave
towered over their ship and threatened to overwhelm them, but they were steered
to safety by their helmsman Tiphys and moored on the European shore of the strait.
The surrounding area was ruled by the Thracian seer PHINEUS, who was not only
blind but was in great misery because he was being persecuted by the Harpies.
Apollonius explains his fate by saying that he had been granted prophetic powers
by Apollo but had misused his gift to foretell the plans of Zeus to mortals in
unerring detail, provoking that god to deprive him of his sight and send the Harpies
against him. These loathsome creatures, here imagined as being like carrion-birds
with women’s heads, had brought him close to starvation, for they would swoop
down to steal most of his food whenever he tried to eat, and would impart a revolting
stench to the little that they left behind.69
In the many conﬂicting accounts of the legend of Phineus, all kinds of explanations are
offered for his blindness and (where relevant) his persecution by the Harpies. In two different
accounts from the Hesiodic corpus, he was blinded ‘because he revealed the route to Phrixos’
(presumably the route to Colchis), or because he chose long life at the expense of his sight
in unexplained circumstances.70 Or in an account which ﬁrst appears in Hellenistic times,
he was blinded by Poseidon for telling the sons of Phrixos how to ﬁnd their way to Greece;71
or he chose to surrender his sight when the gods offered him a choice of two options, saying
that he could either become a blind seer or else be healthy though short-lived without
prophetic powers.72 It is possible that the latter story is a more complete version of the
second of the two Hesiodic accounts mentioned above.
According to another group of stories, Phineus’ troubles arose because he or his second wife
mistreated the sons whom he had fathered by his ﬁrst marriage. Sophocles wrote at least two
plays on this matter, but our information on them is very incomplete. In a full narrative
recorded by the Hellenistic mythographer Asclepiades, Phineus ﬁrst married Kleopatra, a
daughter of Boreas, and then a certain Eurytie, who laid false accusations (doubtless of seduc-
tion) against the sons of his previous wife. So he handed them over to her to be killed, much
— Jason and the Argonauts —
386

to the anger of Zeus, who offered him a choice between blindness and death. In opting for
blindness, he incautiously stated that he no longer wanted to see the sun, and so offended 
the sun-god Helios, who responded by sending the Harpies against him; but he was ﬁnally
delivered from them by the Boreads after the arrival of the Argonauts, as in Apollonius’
account (see below).73 There are various other accounts in which Phineus’ second wife, who is
also named as Idaia or Eidothea, accused her stepsons of trying to rape or seduce her, and 
so prompted Phineus to blind or kill them, or to hand them over to her to be blinded 
and imprisoned or put to death. Apollodorus alludes to a version in which Boreas (properly
the Boreads?) and the Argonauts punished Phineus in some unspeciﬁed way for having
blinded his sons in these circumstances.74 Or in an account recorded by Diodorus, the
Argonauts found that Phineus had imprisoned his two sons in a vault, where they were
subjected to constant scourgings. Although Phineus tried to justify the punishment by the
gravity of the charge that had been laid against them, the young men were set free by the
Boreads (who were brothers of their mother Kleopatra); and when Phineus then joined battle
with the Argonauts, he was killed by Herakles along with many others.75
For the nature and origin of the Harpies (Harpuiai, i.e. Snatchers), see p. 57.
To return to Apollonius’ narrative, Phineus told the Argonauts that an oracle had
declared that he would be delivered from the Harpies by two of their number, Zetes
and Kalais, the twin sons of Boreas, who were brothers of his wife; and as soon as
he had assured them that they would not incur the anger of the gods by doing 
so, the Boreads readily agreed to come to his aid. Or in another version, Phineus
established a deal with the Argonauts by promising to use his prophetic powers to
advise them on their journey if they would rid him of the Harpies.76 The Boreads
lay in wait as some food was spread out to draw down the Harpies, and raised their
swords and chased them through the air as soon as they arrived; for the brothers
were winged and could ﬂy swiftly through the sky, as might be expected of sons
of a wind-god. They pursued the Harpies as far as the Strophades, some small islands
to the west of the Peloponnese, where they would have killed them if Iris (the
goddess of the rainbow and a divine messenger, see p. 57) had not appeared and
ordered them to desist. Explaining that it was not lawful for them to attack the
Harpies with their swords since they were agents of Zeus, she promised that they
would never trouble Phineus again in the future, and they duly returned to their
den in Crete.77 Apollonius claims that the islands had formerly been known as the
Plotai or Floating Islands, but were now renamed the Strophadai or Islands of
Turning because the Boreads had turned back (hupestrephon) there.78 According to a
rather different version recorded by Apollodorus, the Harpies were fated to die at
the hands of the Boreads, while the Boreads were fated to die if they ever failed to
catch their prey; and since the Harpies died of exhaustion during the pursuit, one
dropping into a Peloponnesian river and the other onto the Strophades (here wrongly
identiﬁed with the Echinadian Islands), the pursuers died along with the pursued.79
There are also versions in which the Boreads ﬁnally caught up with the Harpies and
killed them.80
Once the Harpies were dead or gone, Phineus provided the Argonauts with invalu-
able information about the future course of their voyage, advising them above all
on how to survive the most immediate danger that awaited them, the Symplegades
or Clashing Rocks. These were two huge rocks that stood at the northern end of

the Bosporos and used to crash together with immense force, crushing anything that
was caught between them. As they were drawing close to the rocks – so Phineus
advised – they should let loose a dove and cause it to ﬂy between them; if it were
crushed by them, they should turn back, taking this as an evil sign from the gods,
but if it should pass through safely, they should follow after it, rowing as hard 
as they possibly could.81 After the dove was sent forth by the Argonaut Euphemos,
it made a safe passage, losing only the very tip of its tail-feathers as the rocks crashed
together; and the Argonauts rowed into the gap with all speed as soon as the rocks
began to separate. With a little help from Athena, they fared as well as the dove,
suffering only a little damage to the stern-ornaments of their ship.82
The Symplegades or ‘Clashing Rocks’ and the Planktai or ‘Wandering Rocks’ were mythical
hazards of a comparable nature which were presumably doublets. In the Odyssey, Kirke is said
to have warned Odysseus that the returning Argo was the only ship that had ever sailed safely
past the Planktai.83 Although Kirke’s account is far from clear, it would appear that ships
were driven against the Planktai by waves and blasts of ﬁre; there is certainly no suggestion
that they were supposed to crash together. Pindar is the ﬁrst author to report explicitly that
the Argonauts had to pass through ‘living’ rocks that crashed together; he indicates that they
had to confront this danger during their outward journey, as is mentioned by Euripides in the
Medeia.84 Euripides refers to the rocks as the Symplegades, while Simonides apparently called
them the Synormades (which means much the same) in a somewhat earlier account;85 they
could also be called the Plegades, Syndromades and the like. Another name, as applied to
them in the Argonautica, is the Kyaneai (Dark Blue Rocks).86 Herodotus mentions that the
Persian king Darios visited the Kyaneiai somewhere near the northern entrance of the
Bosporos, and identiﬁes these rocks with the wandering (planktai) rocks of Greek legend.87
They came to be distinguished, however, from the Homeric Planktai for two good reasons.
These clashing rocks were traversed by the Argonauts during their outward journey rather
than during their return journey as Homer states of the Planktai; and like the neighbouring
perils on Odysseus’ route, the Planktai came to be located in the seas around Italy (even if
they would originally have lain in a purely mythical realm). Apollonius classes the Clashing
Rocks and Wandering Rocks as separate perils accordingly, presenting the Argonauts as
encountering the latter at a later time during their return journey (see p. 395).88
Since there were no moving rocks on the trade-route to the Black Sea in classical times,
they must have become ﬁxed at some point if they had ever existed. Pindar remarks that the
passage of the Argonauts caused the ‘living’ rocks to ‘die’; and Apollodorus explains that they
were fated to stand still if anyone should ever pass safely through them in a ship.89
Phineus was sometimes said to have lived on the Thracian coast of the Black Sea at
Salmydessos or elsewhere; but if it is supposed the Clashing Rocks were located at the entrance
to the Black Sea, it is obviously preferable that he should have lived on the Thracian coast of
the Bosporos as in Apollonius’ account.90
The Argonauts now sailed along the northern coast of Asia Minor until they reached
Colchis at the far end of the Black Sea. (viii) They landed next at the desert island
of Thynias, where Apollo manifested himself to them as he was travelling north
from Lycia to the land of the Hyperboreans. On the advice of Orpheus, they raised
an altar in his honour, offered sacriﬁces on it, and dedicated the island to him.91
(ix) When they called in at the land of the Mariandynians further along the coast
(in the area in which the Greeks would later found the city of Herakleia Pontica),
— Jason and the Argonauts —
388

they received a friendly welcome from the king, Lykos, son of Daskylos, because he
was grateful to them for having subdued Amykos and the Bebrycians, who were
old enemies of his. In the course of their visit, however, they lost two important
members of the crew, the helmsman Tiphys, who died of an illness, and the seer
Idmon, who was killed by a wild boar while out hunting. Ankaios, a son of Poseidon
from Samos (see p. 573, not to be confused with his Arcadian namesake), volun-
teered to take over as helmsman, while the Lapith seer Mopsos (a son of Ampyx,
not to be confused with the more famous son of Manto) took the place of Idmon.92
(x) As they were continuing on their way, they passed the tomb of Sthenelos, son
of Aktor, a hero who had accompanied Herakles on his expedition to the land of
the Amazons and had died there from an arrow-wound during the return voyage.
Since he desired to gaze on heroes like himself, if only for a moment, Persephone
allowed his ghost to rise up to witness their passing; and they called in at the shore
on the advice of their new seer to propitiate him with libations and sacriﬁces.93 (xi)
They landed next at the site of the future city of Sinope (just to the east of the
northernmost projection on the coast), at the spot where Zeus had been fooled by
Sinope, daughter of Asopos, after he had abducted her to that far-off region (see 
pp. 536–7).94 (xii) On meeting with rough seas near the mouth of the river
Thermodon, they beached the Argo there for a while, but were wise enough to hurry
on as soon as they could to avoid any danger of a confrontation with the warlike
Amazons who inhabited the area.95 (xiii) In the last stages of the journey, the
Argonauts called in at the island of Ares, which was inhabited by the fearsome birds
of Ares which could shoot out their feathers like arrows. On the advice of an Arcadian
called Amphidamas, who had seen Herakles use a bronze rattle to put the
Stymphalian birds to ﬂight (see p. 260), the Argonauts frightened the birds off by
shouting loudly and striking their shields. Phineus had ordered them to visit the
island because he knew that they would ﬁnd some useful helpers there, namely the
sons of Phrixos, who had been shipwrecked in the area as they were trying to sail
from Colchis to Greece (see p. 378). Jason was happy to take them on board, knowing
that they would be able to offer invaluable advice on affairs in Colchis.96 After
skirting the rest of the coast of Asia Minor, the Argonauts arrived at the mouth of
the Phasis, the great river that ran through Aietes’ kingdom of Colchis.
How Jason gained the golden ﬂeece
As they rowed up the river, they could see Aietes’ city of Aia and the towering
mountains of the Caucasus on their left, and the plain of Ares and sacred grove of
Ares on their right. The golden ﬂeece was suspended from an oak in the grove.97
After bringing the ship to anchor in a shaded backwater, Jason slept on it overnight
with his comrades and set off for the palace on the following morning accompanied
by Telamon, Augeias and the sons of Phrixos. Although Aietes was highly suspi-
cious, imagining that they were plotting to seize his throne, he entertained them
with due ceremony and decided to test Jason’s mettle by offering to hand over the
ﬂeece if he could perform two formidable tasks in a single day. In the ﬁrst place,
he must yoke two ﬁre-breathing bronze-hooved bulls to a plough and then plough
the intractable meadow of Ares with them; and after achieving this, he must sow

the ﬁeld with teeth from a dragon and then kill all the armed warriors who would
spring up from them. The bull had been presented to the king by Hephaistos, while
the teeth had come from the Theban dragon that had been killed by Kadmos several
generations earlier (for Athena had kept some of its teeth and had passed them on
to Aietes).98
The Argonauts were ﬁlled with gloom when Jason reported back to them since the
tasks seemed to lie beyond the capacity of any mortal. Although Peleus, Telamon,
Idas, the Dioskouroi and even the youthful Meleagros volunteered to attempt them
nonetheless, Argos, son of Phrixos, urged a more cautious approach, suggesting that
he should ask his mother (a daughter of Aietes, see p. 378) to enlist the help of her
sister MEDEIA, who was a priestess of Hekate and adept in magical arts and enchant-
ments; and when this suggestion was conﬁrmed by an omen, it won the approval of
everyone apart from Idas.99 Now Hera was eager that Jason should succeed in his
mission for reasons mentioned above, and she had therefore already taken measures to
ensure that Medeia should fall in love with him; for she had approached Aphrodite
to ask her to bring this about through the agency of her son Eros.100 Under the sway
of the passion thus aroused, Medeia readily agreed to help Jason when Argos’ mother
Chalkiope asked her to do so, and arranged to meet him in secret at dawn at the
temple of Hekate outside the city.101 She provided him with a magical ointment to
render him invulnerable to injury and ﬂame, saying that it would protect him for a
day if he rubbed it on to his body, shield and weapons; and she also advised him on
how to defeat the men who would spring up from the dragon’s teeth, telling him to
throw a stone into their midst from a concealed position to provoke them to ﬁght
among themselves before he launched his own attack. Jason responded by promising
to take her home with him as his wife.102
After making a sacriﬁce to Hekate during the following night, Jason applied the
ointment as Medeia had advised and set off at daybreak to accomplish the tasks.

When the ﬁre-breathing bulls rushed forth from their hidden lair, he fended them
off with his shield as the ﬂame gushed harmlessly around him, and then forced them
to their knees to submit them to the yoke; and goading them forward with the tip
of his spear, he compelled them to plough the meadow of Ares, sowing the dragon’s
teeth as he passed. The task was competed by mid-afternoon, and the armed warriors
began to spring up from the furrows shortly afterwards. Putting his trust in Medeia’s
advice, he raised a boulder from the ground and hurled it among them without
revealing himself; and they duly attacked one another and fought until only a few
were left alive, at which point he rushed forward and ﬁnished them off with little

difﬁculty. Aietes was so enraged at his triumph that he strode back to the city
without saying a word. He had never had any intention of surrendering the ﬂeece,
and now gathered his main advisers together to plot the destruction of his unwel-
come visitors.103 His schemes were foiled by Medeia, however, who stole away from
the palace during the night and warned the Argonauts to make a quick departure.
Before the sun rose into the sky, she guided the ship to the grove of Ares and
led Jason to the ﬂeece. She lulled the guardian-dragon to sleep by chanting incan-
tations and sprinkling a magical potion into its eyes, so making it possible for Jason
to snatch the ﬂeece without suffering any danger.104 In this version by Apollonius
(which may have been based on a similar account by Antimachus of Colophon, a
poet of the ﬁfth century BC105), Jason’s theft of the ﬂeece hardly ranks as a heroic
exploit; but in the earlier tradition, as attested by Pindar and Pherecydes, Jason
confronted and killed the dragon (doubtless with his sword) in the true manner of
a monster-slaying hero.106 In a striking variant which is known only from visual
images (the earliest dating to the ﬁrst quarter of the ﬁfth century BC), Jason appar-
ently slew the dragon from inside after being swallowed by it. Euripides’ Medeia
seems to be exceptional in suggesting that Medeia took over the hero’s role by
killing the dragon herself.107
In an early epic account from the Naupaktia, Aietes invited the Argonauts to a feast at the
palace (evidently after Jason had fulﬁlled his tasks) with the intention of killing them when
they fell asleep afterwards; but Aphrodite distracted him at the critical time by inspiring
him with a sudden lust for his wife Eurylyte, and the Argonauts took to ﬂight during his
absence on the advice of the seer Idmon. Hearing the clatter of their feet as they were
leaving, Medeia rushed after them with the golden ﬂeece and sailed away with them. Jason
had presumably brought the ﬂeece to the palace after killing the dragon (or it may perhaps
have been kept there).108
The return voyage of the Argonauts
The object of the journey was now accomplished, and the Argonauts could begin
their return. Although it was commonly agreed that the Argonauts sailed out to
Colchis by way of the Hellespont, Bosporos and Black Sea, accounts of their return
journey were far more varied. The proposed itineraries can be divided into four main
categories.
(i) It could simply be imagined that they retraced the route of their outward
journey, sailing west across the Black Sea and then back to the Aegean by way of
the Bosporos and Hellespont; but although they are occasionally stated to have
followed this course in tragedy and later sources,109 most authors favoured a more
adventurous itinerary.
(ii) In some accounts from the earlier tradition, the Argonauts rowed eastwards
up the Phasis to the encircling Ocean and then passed southward around it until
they arrived at the east coast of Africa. Dragging the Argo ashore there, they hauled
or carried it overland in a westerly or north-westerly direction, either to Lake Tritonis
in Libya (which was supposed to have an outlet that opened into the Mediterranean,
see p. 396) or to the Nile. After reaching the Mediterranean, they were able to make
— Jason and the Argonauts —
392

their way home by a known route. This version can be traced back to the Hesiodic
Catalogue; Pindar remarks that the Argonauts carried their ship through the wilds
of Africa for twelve days.110
(iii) Timagetos, a geographer of the fourth century BC, proposed a westerly route
in which the Argonauts sailed back across the Black Sea, rowed up the Istros
(Danube) and then made their way to the western Mediterranean by passing down
a branch of the river that supposedly led into the Tyrrhenian Sea. They were then
able to make their way home by sailing around the southern coasts of Italy and
Greece.111 Apollonius, whose surviving account will be summarized below, offers a
related but rather more complicated version in which the side-branch of the Istros
took the Argonauts to the head of the Adriatic; from there they rowed up the
Eridanos (Po) and passed through to the western Mediterranean by way of the Rhone,
which is here described as a branch of the same river (along with a third branch
which led to the northern seas). Some authors tried to remove the geographical
implausibilities from Timagetos’ version by suggesting that the Argonauts rowed
to the head-waters of the Istros and then carried the Argo overland (across the Alps!)
until they arrived at a suitable southward-ﬂowing stream.112
(iv) Inspired by the northern explorations of the Greek seafarer Pytheas of Massalia
(Marseilles), the early Hellenistic historian Timaeus of Tauromenium (died c. 260 BC)
proposed a northerly route. Finding that they were unable to escape through the
Bosporos because it was blocked by the Colchians, the Argonauts sailed across to the
north-eastern corner of the Black Sea to leave it through the Tanais (Don). 
After rowing up to its source, they hauled the Argo overland until they found another
river that issued into the outer Ocean in the north. By sailing anti-clockwise around
that Ocean, always keeping the mainland to their left, they found their way to 
the region of Gadeira (Cadiz) and entered the Mediterranean through the Straits 
of Gibraltar.113
On discovering that the Argonauts had ﬂed with his daughter and the golden
ﬂeece, Aietes hastily assembled a large force of Colchians to hunt them down. He
either led the pursuit himself or placed the ﬂeet under the command of his son
APSYRTOS (or Absyrtos). Since Apsyrtos was considered to have been no more than
an infant at this time in the early tradition, he originally appeared in quite another
role. In the earliest recorded account of his story by Pherecydes, Medeia seized him
from his cot and brought him to the Argo at the bidding of Jason; and when the
Argonauts came under pursuit, they slaughtered the child, chopped him up, and
threw his remains into the river (presumably the Phasis).114 Although the surviving
summary offers no explanation, they evidently adopted this brutal measure to cause
Aietes to fall behind as he delayed to recover the remains of his child; this is expli-
citly stated by Apollodorus, whose account was apparently derived from a different
source since it varies in some of its details. For according to his narrative, Medeia
killed and dismembered the child herself, and the incident must have occurred rather
later at the opposite end of the Black Sea since Aietes is said to have buried the
child at Tomoi, a town on the Thracian coast whose name could be interpreted as
meaning ‘Pieces’ or ‘Slices’.115 In some versions from tragedy, on the other hand,
Apsyrtos was killed in the palace at Colchis before the Argonauts departed.116

Apollonius offered a wholly different account of his fate as we will see, presenting
him as a fully-grown man who led the Colchian pursuit on his father’s behalf until
he was treacherously murdered through the machinations of his sister.
For a full and detailed account of the return journey of the Argonauts, we must
turn once again to Apollonius.117 After leaving the river Phasis, they sailed west-
ward across the Black Sea, stopping off at the mouth of the river Halys about
half-way down the northern coast of Asia Minor to offer a sacriﬁce to Hekate.
Remembering that the seer Phineus had advised them to choose a different route
on their return, they discussed the matter during this halt and agreed to a sugges-
tion from Argos, son of Phrixos, who proposed that they should sail up the Istros
(Danube) and then down to the Adriatic through a side-branch of the river. A large
Colchian ﬂeet had set out in the mean time under the command of Apsyrtos; after
crossing the Black Sea without ﬁnding any sign of the Argonauts, the ﬂeet sepa-
rated into two sections, one passing out through the Bosporos while the other headed
for the Istros. Although Hera laid down a trail of heavenly light to guide the
Argonauts to the river, the latter section of the Colchian ﬂeet (which was led 
by Apsyrtos) entered it ahead of them by passing through its southernmost mouth.
As a consequence, the Colchians were able to reach the (imaginary) Adriatic mouth
of the river ahead of the Argo and so block the ship’s escape.118 They offered generous
terms to the Argonauts, promising to let them depart with the ﬂeece if Medeia were
put ashore to allow her fate to be decided by arbitration; but Medeia had no inten-
tion of submitting to any such process and plotted the death of Apsyrtos to ensure
that she would not be detained. By encouraging her brother to believe that she
would help him to regain the ﬂeece, she lured him to a secret meeting on the island
in the river-mouth where she was supposed to be put ashore; and when he arrived
at the appointed meeting-place at the temple of Artemis, Jason, who had been
waiting in ambush nearby, caught him by surprise and murdered him. As a pre-
arranged signal, Medeia raised a torch to the Argonauts, who massacred the crew
of Apsyrtos’ ship in a surprise attack and then rowed through to the open sea with
Jason and Medeia. To save them from being pursued, Hera deterred the surviving
Colchians by sending terrible lightning-ﬂashes.119
After the Argonauts had passed some way down the Adriatic, Hera sent storm-
winds to carry them back again, for Zeus had been angered by the treacherous
murder of Apsyrtos and therefore had other plans for them. The speaking timber
on the Argo (see pp. 382–3) warned them of his displeasure, and announced that
they would not escape the sea and its dangers unless the murderers were purged of
their blood-guilt by the enchantress Kirke (who was Medeia’s aunt).120 Since Kirke’s
island lay off the west coast of Italy, the Argonauts travelled to the western
Mediterranean by the implausible route mentioned above, namely by passing up the
Eridanos (Po) and then down the Rhone, here regarded as a branch of the same
river. While doing so, they passed the spot at which Phaethon had plunged to his
death (see p. 45). After making their way back into the Mediterranean, they called
in at the Stoichades (Îles d’Hyères, to the west of Toulon) and then at Aithalia
(Elba), where they wiped the sweat from their skin with pebbles from the shore; as
a result, the beach has been covered ever since with pebbles that resemble scrapings
— Jason and the Argonauts —
394

from human skin. When they ﬁnally arrived at Kirke’s island, Jason and Medeia
seated themselves as suppliants in her halls, and she performed the rites that were
necessary to purify them from the murder.121
The next stage of the voyage took the Argonauts around the southern tip of Italy
to the island of Alkinoos, king of the Phaeacians, whose realm is here identiﬁed
with the island of Corcyra (Corfu) off north-western Greece. On the way, they were
confronted by some of the dangers that would later threaten Odysseus when he
passed through the same seas after the Trojan War. As they were sailing past the
island of the Sirens – enchanting singers who lured sailors to their death through
the beauty of their song (see p. 496) – Orpheus drowned out their voices by strum-
ming a loud and rapid melody on his lyre. One member of the crew, however, a
certain Boutes, son of Teleon from Athens, heard enough of their song to feel
impelled to jump overboard and swim towards them; but Aphrodite snatched him
up from the sea and carried him away to Cape Lilybaeum at the western tip of Sicily
(where she was said to have taken him as her lover, and to have borne him a son,
Eryx, see p. 266).122 During the most dangerous section of the voyage at the Straits
of Messina, the Argonauts beneﬁted from the unseen help of Thetis and her fellow-
Nereids, who guided them between Skylla and Charybdis (see p. 496), and then
through the Planktai (Wandering Rocks, see p. 388), propelling the ship from one
sister to another as though it were a ball. After escaping these perils and skirting
the meadows of Thrinacia where the daughters of Helios herded the cattle and sheep
of the Sun, they sailed swiftly across the Ionian Sea to the island of Alkinoos.123
On the very day of their arrival, the Colchians who had sailed out through the
Bosporos also arrived at the island and demanded that Alkinoos should surrender
Medeia, threatening him with war if he refused. Medeia approached Arete, the queen
of the Phaeacians, and appealed to her as a suppliant, arousing such pity in her that
she begged her husband to resist the Colchian demands. When Alkinoos replied
that he would not separate Medeia from Jason if she were married to him, but would
feel obliged to return her to her father if she were still a virgin, Arete sent a secret
message to Jason to inform him of the decision. So he married Medeia without
delay, and the couple spent their wedding-night in the sacred cave of Makris, lying
together on the golden ﬂeece. Makris, the former owner of the cave, was a daughter
of Aristaios who had been expelled from her native Euboea by Hera for having
tended the infant Dionysos. On hearing Alkinoos’ judgement on the following day,
the Colchians accepted it without attempting to fulﬁl their threats, and asked to
be allowed to remain among the Phaeacians since they were afraid to return to Aietes
without Medeia.124
After leaving the island on the seventh day, the Greeks set off to sail around the
southern tip of the Peloponnese, but were blown off course by a violent storm which
carried them south for nine days and nights until the Argo was ﬁnally cast ashore
on the desert coast of Libya. On the advice of the guardian-nymphs of the land,
they hoisted the ship on to their shoulders and carried it overland for twelve days
and nights until they arrived at Lake Tritonis. They lost two of their companions
in the area before proceeding on their way, for Kanthos, son of Abas, was killed by
Kaphauros (a local herdsman who was descended from Minos, see p. 353) while

trying to rustle his sheep, and the seer Mopsos died from a snake-bite. Poisonous
snakes had abounded in Libya ever since they had ﬁrst sprung up from the blood
that had dripped from the Gorgon’s head as Perseus was ﬂying over the land (see
p. 240). After launching the ship on to the waters of the lake, the Argonauts searched
in vain for an outlet to the sea. Orpheus proposed that they should set a tripod on
the shore as an offering to the local gods for their safe return; and when they did
so, Triton, the god of the lake, appeared to them in the guise of a young man and
directed them on their way. He also gave Euphemos the clod of earth from which
the island of Thera would subsequently grow (see p. 397 and 571). On reaching
the open sea, they sailed east along the African coast and then north toward Crete.125
While searching for fresh water in the neighbourhood of the Tritonian lake (which was
presumably salty), the Argonauts came across the nymphs of the Hesperides and asked them
where they could ﬁnd some water. Now it happened that Herakles had arrived there the
previous day to steal some of the apples of the Hesperides (see p. 272), and the nymphs
were therefore able to point them to a spring that the hero had created nearby with a stamp
of his foot. As a result of this sequence of events, Herakles saved the lives of his former
comrades even though he had been separated from them long before. The Argonaut Lynkeus,
who had exceptional powers of sight, thought that he could just see the hero disappearing
into the distance, rather as someone at the beginning of the month might see or suppose
that he sees the moon through a bank of cloud.126
On arriving at Crete, the Argonauts found that the island was guarded by TALOS,
a huge man of bronze who had been constructed by Hephaistos and had been
presented to Minos by his creator (or to Europa by Zeus) to fulﬁl this function. He
was also described, rather less appropriately, as the last survivor of the bronze race
(even though the members of that race were not literally made of bronze in the
Hesiod’s myth of the races, see p. 70).127 He used to keep watch by running 
round the island three times a day, and would repel unwelcome visitors by hurling
rocks at their ships;128 it was also claimed that he used to destroy his adversaries
by burning them up, either by heating himself in a ﬁre and then enfolding them
in a deadly embrace, or by simply hurling them into a ﬁre.129 He was vulnerable,
however, at the ankle since the single vein that ran through his body was covered
by a thin membrane alone at that point and his life-ﬂuid (ichor) would run out if
it were punctured.130 Or else the vein had a stopper at the ankle in the form of a
bronze nail, which could be pulled out with similar effect.131 Although he tried to
repel the Argo in his usual manner as it approached the shores of Crete, Medeia was
able to take advantage of this weakness of his to bring about his death. After ﬁrst
invoking the Keres (Death-spirits) against him, she so confused him by casting the
evil eye on him and sending phantoms against him that he cut his ankle on a rock
as he was trying to heave up a boulder, and he expired as his life-ﬂuid gushed out
like molten lead.132 Or in an earlier form of the story, she gained access to him by
promising to make him immortal and then caused his death by pulling the nail
from his ankle. There was also a further version in which the Argonaut Poias, the
father of the great archer Philoktetes, killed him by shooting an arrow into his
ankle.133 When he was safely dead, the Argonauts landed to draw water and rested
on the island overnight.134
— Jason and the Argonauts —
396

As the Argonauts were sailing north toward the scattering of islands in the
southern Aegean, they were engulfed by a night of such impenetrable darkness that
it seemed to have risen up from the Underworld. Finding that he was unable to
make out a course, Jason prayed for help to Apollo, who revealed (anephe¯ne) the little
island of Anaphe with a ﬂash of his golden bow. So the Argonauts sheltered on the
island for the night, founding a sanctuary there to Apollo.135 In response to a
prophetic dream, Euphemos hurled the clod of earth that he had received from
Triton into the sea nearby on the following morning, and the island of Thera grew
up from it (see p. 571). The Argonauts continued northward through the Aegean
islands, stopping brieﬂy at Aegina, and then passed through the straits between
Euboea and Central Greece to reach their home-port in Thessaly.136
Jason and Medeia in Greece
After arriving in Iolkos, Jason delivered the golden ﬂeece to Pelias to prove that he
had fulﬁlled his task, and then set out to sea in the Argo with his comrades for one
last time, taking the ship to the Isthmus of Corinth to dedicate it to Poseidon, the
great god of the sea.137 On his return, he schemed with Medeia to contrive the
death of the king.
Although it was generally agreed in the classical and later tradition that Medeia used her
special skills to cause his death, there is no deﬁnite evidence for this from before the mid-
sixth century BC. As has been mentioned, Pherecydes recorded a version of the myth,
presumably of fairly ancient origin, in which Hera caused Jason to be sent for the ﬂeece
because she knew that Medeia would come back with him and cause the death of Pelias (see
p. 381); but this cannot have been the only early version, since a tradition from the archaic
period suggested that Jason and the Argonauts attended the funeral games for Pelias,138
which would have been out of the question if Jason had connived in his death. There is no
sign of any such thing in the relevant passage in the Theogony, even if Pelias is described as
violent and overbearing; for we are merely told that Jason brought the daughter of Aietes
back with him in his ship, and that she bore him a son Medeios who was brought up in
the mountains by Cheiron (i.e. on Mt Pelion, not far from Iolkos). One may suspect that
Jason settled down with Medeia at Iolkos under the rule of Pelias in the earliest version of
the story. This son Medeios is also known to have been mentioned by Cinaethon, an early
Spartan epic poet (who gave him a sister called Eriopis), but he disappears from sight there-
after; he was probably the eponym of the Medes, serving the function that was assigned to
Medos, the son of Medeia and Aigeus (see below), in the subsequent tradition.139
In the usual account, Medeia ingratiated herself with the daughters of Pelias in order
to work his destruction. She told them that she would be able to rejuvenate their
aged father by means of her potions and spells; and as proof of her powers, she
killed and dismembered an old ram, and then brought it back to life again as a
young lamb by boiling its remains in a cauldron together with magical herbs.
Greatly impressed by this demonstration, the princesses chopped up their father and
put his remains into the cauldron; but on this occasion Medeia omitted to add the
necessary herbs and Pelias regained neither his youth nor his life.140 In the original
tradition, Medeia would have been perfectly capable of rejuvenating Pelias if she

had wanted to. Some surviving verses from the Returns, an early epic in the Trojan
cycle, tell how she turned Jason’s father Aison into a young man in the bloom of
his youth by brewing up herbs in her golden cauldrons; and it was sometimes even
suggested that she rejuvenated Jason himself.141 In rationalized accounts of her
deception of the princesses, however, from the time of Euripides onwards, it is
explained that she resorted to trickery to achieve her end, usually by substituting
a new sheep for the dead one.142
Having no wish to remain in Iolkos after this gruesome vengeance had been
exacted, Jason consigned the kingdom to Akastos, the son and heir of Pelias, and
sailed away with Medeia to start a new life abroad.143 Or in another account, Akastos
drove Jason and Medeia out of the land after learning of his father’s fate.144
Aison was already dead in most accounts by the time of his son’s return. According to
Apollodorus, Pelias decided to kill Aison when he became convinced that Jason would never
return; but Aison asked to take his own life, and committed suicide by drinking bull’s blood
(which was thought to be dangerous because it would coagulate in the drinker’s throat).
Aison’s wife, Perimede, cursed Pelias for causing the death of her husband and hanged herself,
leaving an infant son Promachos, who was killed in his turn by the king. Or in the slightly
different account by Diodorus, Pelias ordered Aison to commit suicide, and his wife (here
called Amphinome) stabbed herself afterwards.145 These events could be presented as
providing an added motive for the revenge of Jason and Medeia.
In the visual arts and literary accounts, the number of the daughters of Pelias (the Peliades)
varies from two to ﬁve. Apollodorus lists four, Alkestis, Pelopia, Peisidike and Hippothoe,
and Hyginus adds a ﬁfth, Medousa.146 Alkestis was famous in her own right as the noble-
minded wife of Admetos (see p. 151); some said that she was marked out from her sisters
as the only one who refused to lay hands on her father.147 As soon as the true effects of their
action became clear, the Peliades ﬂed into exile (or were expelled by their brother Akastos).
According to an Arcadian tradition, they settled at Mantineia, where their supposed graves
could be seen in historical times; or in another account, Jason found good husbands for them
abroad.148 Akastos was best remembered otherwise for the part that he played in the legend
of Peleus (see pp. 533–4).
After their departure from Iolkos, Jason and Medeia settled in Corinth (except in
an early epic account that took them to Corcyra149). In the standard later version
of their Corinthian legend, as inspired by Euripides’ Medeia, they lived there content-
edly for some years until Kreon, the king of Corinth (not to be confused with his
Theban namesake), offered his daughter Glauke to Jason as a wife. Placing social
and political advantage ahead of ties of loyalty and gratitude, Jason agreed to accept
her, much to the anger and distress of Medeia, who begged him to reconsider. When
her pleas fell on deaf ears, however, she plotted a gruesome revenge. After rubbing
a noxious potion into a ﬁne robe and tiara, she told her two young sons to take
them to the palace as gifts for the bride; and when the princess put them on, they
burst into ﬂames, causing her to be burnt to death, as was her father too when he
rushed to her rescue. As her ﬁnal act of vengeance against her husband, Medeia
murdered their two children before taking ﬂight to Athens; she escaped there on a
chariot drawn by winged dragons which was provided for the purpose by her grand-
father Helios.150
— Jason and the Argonauts —
398

A local tradition at Corinth claimed that Mermeros and Pheres, the two sons of Jason and
Medeia, were stoned to death by the Corinthians themselves for having brought the deadly
gifts to the princess. The spirits of the dead children avenged their undeserved fate by
visiting death on the infants of Corinth until the citizens, on the advice of an oracle, appeased
them by offering annual sacriﬁces to them and by raising an altar to Phobos (Fear). The
sacriﬁces were continued until the city was razed by the Romans in 146 BC.151 Or in another
account, Medeia killed Kreon with some of her potions and then ﬂed to Athens, setting her
sons on the altar of Hera Akraia because they were too young to accompany her. She assumed
that Jason would come to their rescue, but some associates of Kreon put them to death and
spread the rumour that she had not only killed Kreon but her own children too.152
According to a wholly different account offered by the Corinthian epic poet Eumelos, the
Corinthians invited Medeia to their city to become their queen since the land had been
granted to her father by Helios long before and the throne had fallen vacant in the mean
time (see further on p. 432). Medeia ruled there in conjunction with Jason until he discov-
ered that she had caused the death of all of their children at birth, having buried each of
them in turn in the sanctuary of Hera in the hope of rendering them immortal. When he
abandoned her as a consequence, sailing back to Iolkos, Medeia decided to leave also and
transferred the throne to Sisyphos (who was more commonly regarded as the founder of the
city, see p. 430).153
Or in a story from a Hellenistic source, the Corinthians came to reject Medeia’s rule
because she was a foreigner and a sorceress, and killed her fourteen children, seven boys and

seven girls, even though they had sought sanctuary at the altar of Hera. The gods sent a
plague to punish the Corinthians for this grave act of sacrilege, and the citizens of high
birth were obliged to expiate for the crime thereafter by dedicating seven boys and seven
girls each year to perform certain rites in the temple of Hera.154 As with the other local
story mentioned above, this is an aetiological legend that was devised to provide an expla-
nation for a cultic practice.
On arriving in Athens, Medeia won the favour of the ruler, Aigeus, by curing him
of his infertility. He asked her to become his wife and she bore him a son, Medos,
who was destined to give his name to Media and the Medes. When Theseus subse-
quently arrived, however, to claim his birthright as the ﬁrstborn son of Aigeus,
Medeia was expelled along with her child for attempting to plot his death (see
further on p. 344).155 In one account, she returned home to Colchis to ﬁnd that
Aietes had been deposed by his brother Perses, and she killed the usurper to restore
her father to the throne.156 Or else her son Medos did so, and then advanced to the
south-east with an army of Colchians to establish a kingdom of his own, conquering
the lands to the south of the Caspian Sea that would be known as Media there-
after.157 Or in another account, Aigeus granted Medeia an escort to take her wherever
she wished, and she travelled ﬁrst to Phoenicia and then into the interior of Asia,
where she married an illustrious local ruler. She bore Medos to this king rather than
to Aigeus as in the usual tradition; and Medos gave his name to the people of the
land when he succeeded to the throne.158
In contrast to his wife, Jason had no signiﬁcant adventures after the end of their
marriage; only the manner of his death remains to be considered. In Euripides’
Medeia, he is told by Medeia that he will meet with a shabby death when struck
by a falling timber from the Argo; and some claimed that she herself contrived such
a death for him by persuading him to sleep under the rotting poop of the ship.159
Or else he committed suicide in his distress at the loss of his children;160 or he was
killed along with his prospective bride and father-in-law in the ﬁre at the palace in
Corinth.161
It may be said that Jason’s star declines in the classical and later tradition as that
of Medeia rises, for she comes to be portrayed as an increasingly strong-minded and
imposing ﬁgure (if not exactly an admirable one) while Jason comes to be shown
as irresolute by comparison and even mean-minded. Euripides’ portrayal of the
couple in his Medeia seems to have played a major part in encouraging this trend.
In the early epic tradition, however, Jason would doubtless have been a hero of
unimpeachable valour who could rank with other great monster-slaying heroes such
as Perseus, Theseus or Bellerophon.

THE HISTORY OF 
THE DEUKALIONID FAMILY

T
he two greatest families in Greek heroic mythology were the Inachids, who
originated in Argos, and the Deukalionids, who originated in Central Greece and
spread to other areas of the Greek mainland and also to the western Peloponnese.
After having devoted the preceding chapter to the greatest adventure associated with
this second family, Jason’s quest for the golden ﬂeece, we must now go on to trace
its full history from the time of its founding. Deukalion, son of Prometheus, the
founder of the family, and his wife Pyrrha, who was the daughter of the ﬁrst woman
Pandora, were the central ﬁgures in the myth that was devised to account for the
origin of the people of Eastern Locris in east-central Greece. After surviving a great
primordial ﬂood that inundated much of Greece (or the whole of it or indeed the
whole world in accounts from the later tradition), Deukalion and Pyrrha created a
new race of people in Locris by tossing stones over their shoulders; and they also
produced various children by natural process, including Hellen, the eponym of the
Greek people, the Hellenes. Hellen was in his turn the father or grandfather of Aiolos,
Doros, Achaios and Ion, the eponyms of the four main divisions of the Greek people,
the Aeolians, Dorians, Achaeans and Ionians. None of these were of any signiﬁcance
as heroes of legend (apart from Ion to some limited extent). All the main heroes and
heroines of the family were descended from Aiolos alone through his many sons and
daughters; the history of the Deukalionids is largely the history of the Aiolids.
Aiolos, who would have lived in Central Greece near the lands of Deukalion, had
seven sons and ﬁve daughters who scattered to different parts of Greece. As might
be imagined from this, the present family is more complicated in its structure and
history than the family of the Inachids, in which there were only three main lines
located in places of the ﬁrst importance. Not only did the Deukalionids come to
establish ruling lines in a greater variety of places of variable signiﬁcance, but each
of these ruling lines tended to be prominent in mythical history for only a gener-
ation or two (in marked contrast to the Inachid lines in Argos and Thebes). Even
if some of the forthcoming material is therefore bound to be of relatively limited
interest, it will be worthwhile nonetheless to review the history of the family in a
full and systematic manner rather than merely pick out a few of the more notable
heroes and myths. In doing so, we will follow the practice of the ancient mythog-
raphers by considering each of the children of Aiolos and their respective descendants

in turn, beginning with his daughters (pp. 409ff) and then passing on to his sons
(pp. 420ff).
The ruling lines founded by these sons and daughters of Aiolos were located in
three main areas, in southern Thessaly in the lands adjoining the Gulf of Pagasai,
in Aetolia in the south-western reaches of the mainland, and in the western
Peloponnese. The principal Deukalionid kingdoms may thus be pictured as lying
on a semicircle centred on the family’s area of origin, extending from Thessaly in
the north-east through Aetolia and then across the Gulf of Corinth to Elis and
Messenia. Some lines were established elsewhere, however, in Central Greece and at
Corinth and on the Aegean island of Seriphos.
The Aetolian royal family was descended from Kalyke, one of the daughters of
Aiolos, as was the less important Eleian royal line also. Calydon, the chief city of
Aetolia, was famous in myth as the home of Oineus and his son Meleagros, who led
many of the foremost heroes of Greece in the hunt for the Calydonian boar (see 
pp. 414ff), the second of the great panhellenic adventures associated with this family. 
All the other main branches of the family were descended from sons of Aiolos. As we
saw in the last chapter, Kretheus founded a Thessalian branch that was important for
its association with the Argonautic saga. We will consider other aspects of the
Thessalian mythology of Kretheus’ family in the present chapter (pp. 425ff), and also
another interesting Thessalian line that was founded in Phylake by a son of another
of the sons of Aiolos (p. 435). One of the sons of Kretheus, Amythaon, crossed over
to Messenia in the south-western corner of the Peloponnese, where he founded a family
of diviners and Peloponnesian rulers that included the great seer Melampous among
its members (pp. 426ff). Amythaon lived as a guest of his half-brother Neleus in
sandy Pylos, which was celebrated in myth as the home of Nestor, the long-lived
youngest son of Neleus (pp. 424–5ff). Neleus had established his kingdom on coastal
lands in Messenia that were granted to him by Perieres, son of Aiolos, who had
founded a Messenian ruling line that was destined to die out relatively early, leaving
the Neleids in control of the land (pp. 422ff). Mention should also be made of the
Corinthian line that was founded by Sisyphos, son of Aiolos, a cunning trickster who
was the grandfather of a great hero of more conventional kind, the monster-slayer
Bellerophon. We have already encountered Athamas, a much-married Boeotian
member of the family (see further on pp. 420ff); and many other notable heroes and
heroines from these and other areas will be found among the descendants of
Deukalion and Aiolos.
DEUKALION AND HIS IMMEDIATE FAMILY
Deukalion and Pyrrha survive the great ﬂood
DEUKALION, the ﬁrst man of Central Greece and a survivor of the great ﬂood,
was a son of Prometheus. According to quite early reports, his mother was an
Okeanid called Hesione1 (even if one might have supposed that he would be
immortal if both of his parents were divine). He married his cousin PYRRHA, who
was the daughter of Epimetheus, the foolish brother of Prometheus, by the ﬁrst
— The history of the Deukalionids —
402

woman, Pandora.2 Since Pandora was a creation of the gods (see p. 93), Pyrrha was
the ﬁrst woman to be born on the earth by natural process. Deukalion and Pyrrha
were associated primarily with the region of Locris in east-central Greece.
When the myth of the great ﬂood was introduced from the Near East, Noah’s
role (or something like it) was assigned to Deukalion as a hero from the suitably
remote past. The earliest full account to survive in any Greek source is that provided
by Apollodorus, which runs as follows. In response to a warning from his father
Prometheus, who knew that Zeus was planning to send a ﬂood to destroy the race
of bronze, Deukalion constructed a large chest, loaded it with provisions, and
climbed into it with his wife. Zeus duly proceeded to pour heavy rain from the sky,
causing most of Greece to be submerged and every human being to be destroyed
apart from a few who found refuge on the highest mountains; but Deukalion and
Pyrrha ﬂoated safely in their chest for nine days and nights, eventually drifting
ashore on Mt Parnassos. After the rains ceased, Deukalion climbed out and offered
a sacriﬁce to Zeus Phyxios (of Escape). When Zeus now sent Hermes to him to offer
him the choice of whatever he most desired, he asked to be provided with a new
race of people. He was told that this would come to pass if he and his wife picked
up some stones and threw them over their shoulders; and when they did so, the
stones thrown by Deukalion turned into men and those thrown by Pyrrha turned
into women.3
Pindar is the ﬁrst author to refer directly to the ﬂood, telling how the mighty
waters overﬂooded the dark earth until they suddenly ebbed away through the
devices of Zeus; Deukalion and Pyrrha descended from Mt Parnassos afterwards to
settle at Opous in Eastern Locris, where they brought new people into being by the
means just described.4 The stone-throwing is mentioned in a Hesiodic fragment,
which states that the people who were brought into being in this way were the
Leleges (i.e. the aboriginal inhabitants of Eastern Locris).5 As Pindar indicates, this
part of the story was inspired by an etymological fancy, since the Greek word laas,
meaning a stone, is deceptively similar to the word laos, meaning people. Although
Deukalion was thought to have ruled in Locris in the earliest tradition, authors from
the Hellenistic period often describe him as a Thessalian, and report accordingly
that he was the king of Phthia or indeed of Thessaly as a whole.6 Hellanicus states
correspondingly that he was washed ashore on Othrys, a mountain in southern
Thessaly, rather than on Parnassos in Central Greece.7 Athenian tradition claimed
that he took refuge at Athens at the time of the ﬂood, and even that he was buried
there in a tumulus near the sanctuary of Olympian Zeus, which he was supposed
to have founded.8 As to the cause of the ﬂood, Apollodorus states, as we have seen,
that Zeus sent it to destroy the people of that era, as identiﬁed with the vicious
bronze race in Hesiod’s myth of the races (although the people of that race perished
through their own violence in Hesiod’s account, see p. 70); while others suggest
that Zeus sent the ﬂood to punish human iniquity, which is not so very different,
or to avenge the crime of Lykaon or of his sons (see p. 538).9
As originally conceived in Greek myth, the great ﬂood was a local affair which
affected mainland Greece alone; and correspondingly, the stone-throwing was not
designed to explain how all or much of the world came to be repopulated, but to
account for the origin of a special people in Greece, the Leleges of Eastern Locris.

403

In Roman accounts, however, the ﬂood is transformed into a universal deluge that
covered the entire world, leaving only a few mountain-tops (or Parnassos alone) still
exposed. According to Ovid, Zeus was so shocked by the crime of Lykaon and human
iniquity in general that he decided to eliminate the present race to replace it with
a new one. Although he initially intended to achieve this by hurling thunderbolts
at every part of the earth, he feared that he might set ﬁre to the heavens if he
adopted that course, and resorted to the use of water instead. The Nereids were soon
amazed to see groves and towns beneath the sea, and dolphins took possession of
the woods and knocked against the tops of oak-trees, and birds dropped into the
sea in exhaustion for want of anywhere to settle. Everyone drowned or died of star-
vation until no mortal was left alive apart from Deukalion and Pyrrha, who sailed
through the waters in a little boat until they ran ashore on Parnassos; and Zeus was
contented that they should survive because he knew of their virtue and piety. So he
drove away the storm-clouds with the help of the North Wind, while Poseidon
settled the waves with his trident and called on Triton to blow his conch-shell horn
to recall the waters to their proper courses. On seeing that they were all alone in
the world, Deukalion and Pyrrha sought an oracle from Themis, who instructed
them to throw the bones of their great mother over their shoulders. Although they
were initially mystiﬁed by this reply, Deukalion came to recognize that it referred
to the stones in the body of Mother Earth, and the couple duly set to work to bring
a new race of mortals into being.10
Hellen and the eponyms of the four main divisions of 
the Hellenic people
Deukalion and Pyrrha had one notable son, Hellen, and various other children too
in differing accounts;11 two of the latter, Protogeneia and Amphiktyon may be
singled out for mention. PROTOGENEIA, the ﬁrst woman to be fathered by a
mortal, was seduced by Zeus and bore him a son, Aethlios, whom we will encounter
below as the ﬁrst king of Elis and father of Endymion (see p. 411).12 AMPHI-
KTYON was the eponymous founder of an important religious association, the
Amphictyonic League. The common sanctuaries of the league were the temple of
Apollo at Delphi and temple of Demeter Ampktionis at Anthela near Thermopylae;
Herodotus mentions that Amphiktyon had a shrine at the latter temple. In reality,
of course, the name of this and other such associations (amphiktyoneiai) indicated that
they were formed from ‘dwellers around’ or neighbours (amphiktyones). Lokros, the
eponym of Deukalion’s home-province of Locris, was said to have been a grandson
or great-grandson of Amphiktyon. Through confusion with the present Amphiktyon,
who would have ruled at Thermopylae, the primordial king of Athens of the same
name (see p. 367) was sometimes described as a son of Deukalion.13
HELLEN was the eponym of the Greek people, the Hellenes, and the ancestor of
all the main lines in the family through children borne to him by his wife, the
nymph Orseis.
The Hellenes, whose name came to be applied to the Greek people as a whole, were originally
a particular tribe of Greeks who lived in southern Thessaly. They still appear as such in the
— The history of the Deukalionids —
404

Iliad, which names them among the men who were led to Troy by Achilles (who came from
Phthia in the same region);14 although Homer uses the word ‘Panhellenes’ as a general term
on one occasion,15 he commonly refers to the Greeks as Achaeans, Argives or Danaans. The
Hellenes (in the broad sense of the word) were named Graeci in Latin, after the Graikoi, a
Hellenic people who lived to the west of the Homeric Hellenes. Graikos, the eponym of the
Graikoi, appears in the Hesiodic Catalogue as a son of Zeus by a further daughter of Deukalion
called Pandora.16
The Hellenes considered that their race could be divided into four main groups, the
Aeolians, Dorians, Achaeans and Ionians, as distinguished by differences of dialect,
history, distribution, institutions, and so on; and this idea could be expressed in
genealogical terms by making Hellen, the eponym of the Hellenic race, the father 
or grandfather of the eponyms of the above groups. It was stated accordingly that he
fathered three sons, Aiolos, Doros and Xouthos, and that Xouthos became the father
of Achaios and Ion.17 The latter pair were separated off from Aiolos and Doros as
members of a subsequent generation because the Achaeans and Ionians were thought
to be more closely related to one another than to the Aeolians and Dorians.
It was of course appreciated that the different tribal groups had not always lived
in the same regions, and that the pattern of distribution in classical times was the
outcome of a long and complicated process of migration. We are to imagine that
Hellen lived in the district of Phthiotis in southern Thessaly, the home of the
Hellenes in the Iliad, and that he was succeeded there by Aiolos, whose children
and descendants would scatter to various parts of the mainland and Peloponnese.
Doros would have settled in the small province of Doris in Central Greece, which
was regarded as the ancestral homeland of the Dorians (unless we are to imagine
that he lived in northern Thessaly, which was sometimes thought to have been the
earliest home of his people); and Xouthos was said to have departed to Athens, the
most important of the Ionian cities, where he married an Athenian princess and
fathered Ion and Achaios.
Doros, Ion and Achaios would have been eponyms and little more in the earliest
accounts of the Deukalionid family; not only would they have had no legends, but
they would also have been of scant signiﬁcance genealogically since Aiolos, through
his many sons and daughters, was presented as the progenitor of all the main lines in
the family. DOROS had a single son, AIGIMIOS, whose mythology has already 
been considered in connection with Herakles (see p. 282). As was recounted in
Chapter 8, close and enduring relations were established between his family and that
of Herakles when the great hero assisted him to victory in a war against the Lapiths
while the Dorians were living in the north; and when the Heraklids subsequently
invaded the Peloponnese to reclaim their ancestral rights in the area, the Dorians
accompanied them as allies and settled there under their rule. Although not particu-
larly ancient in its fully developed form, this legend of the return of the Heraklids
provided a mythical explanation for the Dorian migration to the Peloponnese (and
also a justiﬁcation since the Dorians, as a people of northern origin, could have had
no claim of their own to lands in the Peloponnese). Aigimios had two sons, Dymas
and Pamphylos, who were the eponyms of two of the Dorian tribes, the Dymanes and
Pamphyloi; Hyllos, son of Herakles, who became an adoptive son of Aigimios, was

the eponym of the third tribe, the Hylleis. It is reported that Dymas and Pamphylos,
the two sons of Aigimios, joined the Heraklids in their ﬁnal invasion of the
Peloponnese (even if this seems implausible chronologically) but were killed in the
battle in which the Heraklids established the victory.18
Achaios and Ion and their descendants
The Hesiodic Catalogue seems to have dismissed the family of XOUTHOS in ﬁve
lines, merely stating that he married Kreousa, daughter of Erechtheus, who bore Ion
and Achaios to him, and also a daughter Diomede19 (who married her cousin Deion,
see p. 435). In the course of time, however, various stories were developed about
Xouthos and his sons and descendants, and also a legendary account of the Ionian
settlement of Asia Minor. Although most of these tales are of relatively late origin
and of artiﬁcial character, they are of sufﬁcient interest to be worth examining in a
brief excursus.
Xouthos was born in Thessaly, as were all the sons of Hellen, but he fell out with
his brothers, who accused him of having stolen from their joint inheritance, and
was driven into exile in Athens; or else he was obliged to settle abroad because
Hellen bequeathed his throne to his eldest son Aiolos, ordering his other sons to
seek their fortune elsewhere. After winning an honoured position in his new home-
land by helping the Athenians in a war against the Euboeans, he married an Athenian
princess, Kreousa, daughter of Erechtheus, who bore him two sons, Ion and Achaios,
the eponyms of the Ionians and Achaeans.20 When Erechtheus died, Xouthos was
asked to arbitrate on the succession, and awarded the throne to the king’s eldest
son Kekrops (the second Athenian king of that name, see p. 374), so angering the
other princes that they drove him out of the land. So he and his two sons travelled
to Aigialos (i.e. the Coast-land), the coastal province of the northern Peloponnese
that would later be known as Achaea.21
Two parts of Greece were known as Achaea (Achaia) in classical times, the coastal
region of the Peloponnese between Sikyon and Elis, and a region of south-eastern
Thessaly (Phthiotian Achaea). According to Pausanias’ account of the history of
Xouthos’ family, ACHAIOS gave his name directly to the Thessalian Achaea and
only indirectly to the Peloponnesian Achaea. For he decided to leave Aigialos after
the death of his father, in order to travel to Thessaly to recover the inheritance that
his father had lost after falling out with his brothers; and he conquered much of
south-eastern Thessaly with the help of followers from Aigialos and Athens, and
founded a ruling line in his newly won kingdom, naming it Achaea after himself.22
After his departure from the Peloponnese, Aigialos fell under the control of his
brother Ion, and it continued to be ruled by descendants of Ion as an Ionian kingdom
until it was eventually conquered by some ‘Achaeans’ in circumstances that must
now be explained.
Archandros and Architeles, two of the sons of Achaios, decided to leave Thessalian
Achaea to make their home in the Peloponnese, where they married two daughters of
Danaos, king of Argos; and since they came to rule over Argos and Sparta, the people
there came to be known as Achaeans. It hardly needs saying that this part of the story
is an arbitrary invention that has nothing to do with the ancient traditions of either

place. When Teisamenos, the last Pelopid king of Argos and Sparta, was expelled by
the Heraklids and their Dorian allies several generations later (see p. 290), he led his
‘Achaean’ followers north to Aigialos, and tried to reach a peaceful settlement with
the descendants of Ion who ruled the land. The Ionian princes resorted to war,
however, fearing that Teisamenos would be chosen as supreme ruler on account of his
splendid ancestry and ﬁne character if the two populations were allowed to mix.
Although Teisamenos himself was killed in the subsequent ﬁghting, his Achaeans
defeated the Ionians and forced them out of the land. So Aigialos fell under Achaean
control and came to be known as Achaea, while the Ionians left to settle at Athens,
where they were assured of a friendly welcome because Ion had performed valuable
services for the Athenians in earlier times (see below).23 There was also an account in
which Achaios established himself in Aigialos after being exiled from his birthplace
of Athens for an accidental killing, and so gave his name to the Peloponnesian Achaea
in his own lifetime.24
When Achaios departed for Thessaly, ION remained in Aigialos as we have seen,
and raised an army to make war on Selinous, the current ruler of the land. In the
face of this threat the king decided to seek a compromise by offering his daughter,
Helike, to Ion and proposing to make him his heir (for he had no son of his own).
On ascending to the throne, Ion named his people the Ionians after himself and
founded the city of Helike in the name of his wife.25
By virtue of his birth as the son of an Athenian princess, Ion was linked from
the beginning to Athens, which liked to regard itself as the mother-city of the
Ionians; and a still closer connection was established through various stories that
presented him as having commanded the Athenians in war, or even as having become
their king. In a continuation of the preceding narrative from Pausanias, it is stated
that the Athenians invited Ion back at some stage to command them in a war against
the Eleusinians, and that he died there and was buried at Potamoi in southern
Attica, where his tomb could be seen in historical times.26 The war in question was
the one in which Eumolpos led the Eleusinians against Athens (during the reign of
Erechtheus in the standard version, see p. 369). Or in another account, in which
Ion’s father Xouthos was not expelled from Athens, Ion led the Athenians to victory
in the war before ever leaving the land, and won such credit with the citizens that
they chose him as their king and named themselves Ionians after him; and Athens
prospered under his rule and sent out colonies to Aigialos. Or he was simply elected
to become king on account of his personal qualities after the death of his grandfa-
ther Erechtheus.27 It should be noted, however, that there is no proper place for
him in the succession, and that his name is not to be found in the standard king-
list (see p. 364). Herodotus remarks that the four tribes of early Athens (prior to
the reforms of Kleisthenes) were named after Ion’s four sons, Geleon, Aigikores,
Argades and Hoples.28
In a surviving play, the Ion, Euripides offers a distinctive account of Ion’s story,
presenting him as a son of Apollo who had ruled at Athens as the successor of his
adoptive father Xouthos. In this version, Kreousa was raped by Apollo in a cave
under the Acropolis before her marriage to Xouthos, and exposed the resulting child
in the cave at birth, keeping the whole matter secret from her father in accordance
with the god’s instructions. Although she naturally supposed that the infant would

die, Hermes recovered him at Apollo’s request and carried him away to Delphi,
where he was reared as a temple-servant at the shrine of Apollo.29 In the mean time,
Kreousa married Xouthos, who had fought as an ally of her father Erechtheus and
came to succeed him as king of Athens. As the years passed by, Kreousa failed to
produce any children, and the couple eventually travelled to Delphi to consult the
oracle of Apollo.30 Xouthos was told that the ﬁrst person whom he met on going
(io¯n) out of the temple should be accepted by him as his son; and when this 
turned out to be the young temple-servant, Xouthos duly claimed him as his son,
naming him Ion in reference to the circumstances of their meeting. He assumed
that this must be a child whom he had fathered during Bacchic revels at Delphi
before his marriage to Kreousa.31 Having no idea that her own child had survived,
Kreousa naturally assumed the same, and tried to kill Ion with some poisoned wine
out of jealousy. Before he could drink it, however, he was alerted by a bad omen
and poured it on to the ground, and when a dove suddenly died after sipping 
the spilt ﬂuid, he came to realize that somebody had been plotting his death.32
After forcing the truth out of a servant, Ion set out to kill Kreousa, but was prevented
by the intervention of Apollo’s priestess from Delphi. When she revealed his true
origin by producing the cradle in which he had been exposed by Kreousa, a recon-
ciliation was established between the mother and son; and Athena then appeared
and ordered Kreousa to take Ion home with her, and to allow Xouthos to continue
to believe that Ion was his own son.33 The goddess declared that Xouthos himself
would father two children by Kreousa, Achaios and Doros (!), and that Ion would
later succeed to the throne and father four sons who would give their names to the
tribes of Athens (see above); these would in turn father sons who take part in the
colonization of the Cyclades and the coast of Asia Minor.34 The preceding story,
which may have been largely invented by Euripides himself (unless the lost Kreousa
of Sophocles contained something similar), conﬂicted too sharply with the usual
traditions about Ion and the Athenian succession to be accepted as anything more
than a ﬁction.
The legendary account of the Ionian settlement of the west coast of Asia Minor
was set at a very late stage in the mythical history of Greece, two generations after
the Heraklids made their ﬁnal return to the Peloponnese. At that period, many of
the descendants of the Ionians who had been expelled from Achaea were said to
have set out from Athens with Athenian and Pylian allies to found a new Ionian
realm on the opposite shore of the Aegean. To understand the circumstances of this
migration, it is necessary to consider how the return of the Heraklids (see pp. 286ff)
affected events in Pylos and Athens. When the Heraklids established themselves in
Peloponnese, they laid claim to Pylos, the Messenian city that had been the centre
of power of Neleus and Nestor (see p. 290), on the ground that Herakles had settled
the succession there, leaving the city in trust for his descendants (see p. 286); so
the Neleids were obliged to leave, and most of them went to Athens. The most
notable of these Neleid emigrants was Melanthos, who won the throne of Athens
(see p. 376), and Alkmaion, the mythical founder of the noble family of the
Alkmaionidai (see pp. 424–5).35 The ruler who welcomed the Ionians to Athens
was therefore not of native Athenian stock, but a Neleid, Melanthos. Settlers left
Athens for Asia Minor two generations later as the result of a dispute within
— The history of the Deukalionids —
408

Melanthios’ family. For after the death of his son and successor Kodros, two of his
grandsons, Medon and Neleus, quarrelled over the succession because Neleus was
unwilling to accept the authority of his elder brother since he was lame in one foot;
and when the Delphic oracle was consulted on the matter, it awarded the kingdom
to Medon and instructed Neleus and the other sons of Kodros to colonize Asia Minor
with any Athenians who cared to accompany them.36
Along with some contingents from other parts of Greece, the younger sons of
Kodros set off accordingly with a mixed force in which Ionians predominated. On
arriving at the central region of the west coast of Asia Minor, the emigrants divided
into separate groups to found the twelve main cities of the area, which was known
as Ionia from that time forth. Some of these cities had independent foundation-
myths of their own which had to be reconciled with this story. It was said, for
instance, that Miletos had been founded long before by a young man from Crete
called Miletos (see p. 350), but was now resettled by Neleus and a party of the
newcomers, who killed all the male inhabitants (apart from those who ﬂed) and
married their wives and daughters.37 It is interesting to compare this legendary
account of the Ionian migration with that of the Dorian migration into the
Peloponnese (see pp. 286ff, a myth of far greater signiﬁcance). A notable feature of
both legends is the fact that the leaders are of different stock from most of their
followers. As Pausanias remarks,38 a similar pattern can be observed in other legends
of the kind, for Iolaos, an Inachid of Argive descent, was said to have led Thespian
and Athenian colonists to Sardinia (see p. 251), while Theras, who was of Theban
descent, led Spartans and Minyans to Thera (see p. 571).
THE DAUGHTERS OF AIOLOS AND 
THEIR DESCENDANTS
Aiolos and his four lesser daughters
AIOLOS, the eponym of the Aeolians, married Enarete, daughter of Deimachos, who
bore him a large family of seven sons and ﬁve daughters.39 Many important ﬁgures
from early heroic myth, associated for the most part with Thessaly, Central Greece
and the western Peloponnese, can be found among his descendants. We will consider
each of his children and their respective lines in succession, starting with his daugh-
ters. Aiolos himself is little more than a cipher.
Aiolos, son of Deukalion, should be distinguished from the Aiolos who is keeper of the
winds in the Odyssey (see p. 493), even if the two are occasionally confused in ancient sources.
Although essentially an eponym and genealogical link rather than a hero of myth, the present
Aiolos does make an appearance in one interesting mythical tale as the seducer of HIPPE
(or Hippo), the daughter of the Centaur Cheiron. It should be remembered in this connec-
tion that the daughters or wives of Centaurs were fully human in form. In the best-preserved
version of her tale, from the astronomical literature, Hippe ﬂed into the mountains in shame
after becoming pregnant by Aiolos; and when her father arrived in search of her as she was
about to give birth to her child, she prayed to the gods to make her unrecognizable by

changing her form. So she was transformed into a horse (as seems ﬁtting enough for the
child of a Centaur); and she was then transferred to the sky by Artemis on account of her
piety to become the constellation of the Horse (now known as Pegasus).40 Hippe bore Aiolos
a daughter, Melanippe, who appeared in two plays by Euripides; in a fragment from one of
these plays, Melanippe declares that her mother was turned into a horse by Zeus for relieving
mortals from pain by means of charms.41 Or she was transformed for using her divinatory
powers to reveal the secrets of the gods to mortals.42 Or in yet another account, as ascribed
to Callimachus, she was transformed by Artemis because she had ceased to honour the goddess
and attend the hunt (presumably staying away from her because she had become pregnant).43
Aiolos would doubtless have come across Hippe while hunting on Mt Pelion.
Of the ﬁve daughters of Aiolos, one, Alkyone, was remembered as the heroine of a
transformation myth, while the other four are of genealogical signiﬁcance alone. From
that point of view, Kalyke was by far the most signiﬁcant, for she was not only the
ancestor of the Aetolian royal family, which produced such notable heroes as Oineus
and Meleagros, but also of the Eleian royal line. We will follow the history of 
her family in some detail after brieﬂy considering her sisters and their respective
families.
(i) ALKYONE married Keux, a son of Heosphoros (the Morning Star). This Keux
should be distinguished from the one who received Herakles at Trachis (see p. 282),
even if they were sometimes confused in antiquity. He and his wife met an early
death because they used to call one another Zeus and Hera, so angering the real
Zeus that he transformed them into two different kinds of bird, Alkyone into a
halcyon and Keux into a sea-bird of uncertain identity, the keux.44 Or in another
version, Keux was drowned in a shipwreck, and Alkyone mourned for him without
cease or even jumped into the sea in her sorrow, awakening the pity of the gods,
who transformed her and her dead husband into halcyons.45 The halcyon was a myth-
ical sea-bird which nested by the sea, or indeed on the sea, during the ‘halcyon days’
of winter. It was said that Zeus created this calm, lasting a week or a fortnight,
because he had felt sorry at seeing the offspring of the transformed Alkyone being
carried away by the waves; or in Ovid’s version, in which Alkyone’s father is iden-
tiﬁed with the Aiolos who was keeper of the winds, Aiolos restrains the wind for
a week each year to provide a smooth sea for his grandchildren.46
(ii) PEISIDIKE married MYRMIDON, the eponym of the Myrmidons, a warlike
people of southern Thessaly who would later be ruled by Peleus and were
commanded at Troy by his son Achilles. The couple had two sons, AKTOR and a
certain Antiphos of whom nothing is recorded.47 Aktor succeeded his father as ruler
of the Myrmidons in Phthia, and was succeeded in turn by his son EURYTION,
who received Peleus into his kingdom48 in circumstances that will be explained in
a later chapter (see p. 533).
(iii) KANAKE bore a number of children to Poseidon, including Aloeus, the
putative father of the gigantic Aloadai (who launched an assault against heaven, see
p. 91), and Triopas or Triopes, the father of Erysichthon (see p. 133).49
(iv) PERIMELE bore two children to the Aetolian river-god Acheloos, a certain
Orestes (not the famous one) and Hippodamas, whose daughter Euryte became the
mother of Oineus (see p. 413).50
— The history of the Deukalionids —
410

Endymion and his family in Elis
(v) To proceed to the main Aiolid line on the female side, KALYKE married Aethlios,
the ﬁrst king of Elis, to found the Eleian royal family, and also, through a side-
branch, the Aetolian royal family (which was of far greater importance in 
myth). Aethlios was a fairly close relation of hers as a son of Zeus by Protogeneia,
daughter of Deukalion. She bore him a single son, ENDYMION, who succeeded him
as king of Elis, the north-western province of the Peloponnese.51 Or in a rather
different account, Endymion was born to Aethlios and Kalyke in Thessaly, and 
led some Aeolian followers to the Peloponnese to establish himself as the ﬁrst king
of Elis.52
Endymion is of interest in two respects, both for the romantic stories that told
of his relationship with the moon-goddess Selene and his eternal sleep, and for the
part that he played in the dynastic affairs of Elis. Although it was generally agreed
that he was an attractive young man who aroused the love of Selene and that he
sank into an everlasting sleep for one reason or another, the tradition of these matters
is inconsistent and poorly attested. According to one account, Zeus offered him the
choice of whatever he desired at the urging of Selene after she fell in love with him,
and he asked to sleep forever so as to be exempted from the ravages of age and from
death itself in its usual form;53 or else Zeus allowed him to choose the time and
manner of his passing, and he fell asleep forever at a moment selected by himself;54
or since legend related that Selene used to visit him while he was asleep, it came
to be suggested that she herself had put him to sleep so as to be able to visit him
at will and steal kisses from him.55 A wholly different story recounted that he was
admitted into the company of the gods and fell in love with Hera, to the under-
standable annoyance of Zeus, who put an end to the matter by condemning him to
eternal sleep; or in a variant that was doubtless inspired by the corresponding legend
of Ixion (see p. 554), Zeus fooled him into making love with a cloud-image of Hera
and cast him into Hades for his pains.56
Selene was so entranced by the beauty of Endymion that she used to make regular
visits to him at night, whether to make love with him (before the time of his eternal
sleep), or simply to gaze at him as he lay asleep.57 There was a tradition that claimed
that the site of his everlasting sleep and of his admirer’s visits was a cave in Asia
Minor, on Mt Latmos to the south-east of Miletos. Some explained accordingly that
he eventually left Elis to settle on Latmos, where his grave could be seen in histor-
ical times; but the Eleians claimed that his grave was located in their own territory
at Olympia, near the starting-point for the foot-race in the Olympian Games.58 If
he had fallen asleep forever, of course, he would have had no grave at all. There was
a tradition in Elis that Selene bore ﬁfty daughters to him.59
Aitolos and his descendants in Aetolia
By his earthly wife, who was either a naiad nymph or an ordinary mortal of varying
name, Endymion fathered three sons, Paion, Epeios and AITOLOS, and also a
daughter, Eurykyde, who bore Eleios, the eponym of the land, to Poseidon. To deter-
mine the succession, Endymion ordered his sons to race for the throne at Olympia,

and the victory was won by Epeios. Although Aitolos was content to remain in Elis
under his brother’s rule, Paion was so angered by his defeat that he went as far away
as possible, settling in the region of northern Macedonia that would be known as
Paionia ever afterwards (but see also p. 379). Aitolos ruled in Elis for a time after
the death of Epeios, but eventually had to depart into exile after committing an
accidental killing; for while he was attending the funeral games of the early Arcadian
ruler Azan (see p. 549), he ran over a certain Apis, son of Phoroneus or Iason of
Pallantion, in his chariot.60
The throne of Elis passed to Eleios, the eponym of the land, a son of Poseidon by Eurykyde,
daughter of Endymion. Pausanias may be consulted for an account of the subsequent history
of the family.61 Putting aside the interesting body of legend associated with the Olympian
Games, there are only two stories of any real interest in the legendary history of Elis, that
of the conﬂict between Herakles and Augeias, king of Elis (see pp. 260 and 277) and that
of the accession of Oxylos (a descendant of Aitolos who gained the throne by acting as a
guide to the Heraklids, see p. 289). Although Aigeus was usually regarded as a son of the
sun-god Helios, he is ﬁtted into the Eleian royal line through a neat rationalization in
Pausanias’ account, for it is explained that he was really a son of the above-mentioned Eleios,
and that the idea of his divine birth arose because the name of Eleios sounds quite similar
to that of Helios.62
Aitolos left the Peloponnese to settle in the south-western corner of the mainland,
in the area that faced his former home of Elis from the other side of the Corinthian
Gulf. Although the current rulers of the land, three obscure sons of Apollo called
Doros, Laodokos and Polypoites, offered him a friendly welcome, he killed them
nevertheless to seize power in his own right, and killed or subjugated the original
inhabitants of the land, the Kouretes (not to be confused with the daimones of the
same name who guarded the infant Zeus). He named his kingdom Aetolia after
himself.63
By his wife Pronoe, Aitolos fathered two sons, Pleuron and Kalydon, who gave
their names to Pleuron and Calydon, the two main cities of the land. Pleuron’s son
Agenor married Kalydon’s daughter Epikaste, who bore him two children,
Porthaon and Demodike (or Demonike). Porthaon married Euryte daughter of
Hippodamas (see p. 410) and fathered a number of sons by her, including Oineus,
who was destined to become the greatest of the mythical kings of Calydon.64 For
the structure of the family, see Table 10. All the major myths of Aetolia, including
the panhellenic adventure of the hunt for the Calydonian boar, are set in the reign
of Oineus and are connected with him and his immediate family.
Of the lesser sons of Porthaon, only Agrios (the Wild) is of any real interest; he won the
throne for a time when his sons deposed the aged Oineus (see p. 419), and he was the father
of the brutish Thersites.65
According to Hesiodic Catalogue, Porthaon also fathered three daughters by another wife,
Laothoe, daughter of Hypereis, namely Eurythemiste, who became the wife of Thestios,
Sterope, who bore the Sirens to the river-god Acheloos, and Stratonike, who was carried
away by Apollo to become the wife of Melaneus.66 This Melaneus had been fathered by
Apollo on a nymph called Pronoe; he was a superb archer, as beﬁtted a son of Apollo, and
— The history of the Deukalionids —
412

founded a notable family of archers through his son Eurytos, whose feud with Herakles has
already been described (see pp. 273 and 283).
DEMODIKE, the above-mentioned sister of Porthaon, is of importance from a genealog-
ical point of view. Although she was courted by many mortals on account of her exceptional
beauty, and was promised magniﬁcent gifts, she yielded to none of them and bore four
children to the god Ares instead, two of whom, Thestios and Euenos, are of signiﬁcance as
the fathers of some very notable daughters.67 THESTIOS, king of Pleuron, sometimes 
also described as a son of Agenor,68 was second only to Oineus as one of the most powerful
rulers in Aetolia. By a wife who is variously named, he fathered three noteworthy daugh-
ters, Leda, Althaia and Hypermnestra, and also some sons, the Thestiadai, who joined the
hunt for the Calydonian boar and provoked a conﬂict with Meleagros afterwards by disputing
the allocation of the spoils (see p. 417).69 Leda married Tyndareos, king of Sparta, and bore
various children of the ﬁrst importance either to him or to Zeus, including Helen, Klytaim-
nestra and the Dioskouroi (see p. 525); Althaia, as we will see shortly, married Oineus and
played a central part in the story of her son Meleagros; and Hypermnestra married an
Argive ruler, Oikles, to become the mother of the seer Amphiaraos. Thestios makes no
personal appearance in myth except in the tale that suggests that he offered refuge to Tyn-
dareos and Ikarios after they were expelled from Sparta by Hippokoon (see p. 525).
Thestios’ brother EUENOS, the eponym of the river of that name in eastern Aetolia, was
a minor Aetolian ruler who is remembered solely as the father of Marpessa, a maiden of
rare beauty who was courted at the same time by Apollo and the Messenian prince Idas.70
For the story of how she was abducted by Idas, with fatal consequences for her father, and
then rejected Apollo in favour of her mortal suitor, see p. 153.
Oineus and his family at Calydon
OINEUS, king of Calydon, married ALTHAIA, daughter of Thestios, who bore him
several sons including Meleagros and Toxeus, and two noteworthy daughters,
Deianeira, whom we have already encountered as the second wife of Herakles (see
p. 279), and Gorge, who married Andraimon, the successor of Oineus.71 As we will
see (p. 417), all the other daughters of Oineus were said to have been transformed
into birds as they were mourning for Meleagros after his premature death. Meleagros
had an elder brother TOXEUS (Bowman) who was killed by his own father, so
Apollodorus tells us, ‘because he jumped over the ditch (taphros)’.72 This is an
intriguing story because it can be interpreted as providing a parallel for the Roman
myth of the death of Remus, who was killed for jumping over the walls of Rome
while they were in the course of construction (see p. 599); but it is impossible to
draw any deﬁnite conclusion from Apollodorus’ brief remark. Meleagros survived to
become the great hero of the family in any case, even if he too was destined to die
prematurely. It was sometimes suggested that he was really a son of Ares, evidently
in view of his martial prowess.73 The other sons of Oineus are empty names apart
from Agelaos, who is mentioned by Bacchylides as a victim of the Calydonian boar;74
none were available in any case to protect Oineus during the troubles of his old age
or to inherit the throne from him.
In view of the meaning of Oineus’ name (Wine-man), it is hardly surprising that
there should have been tales that linked him to Dionysos and the introduction of
wine. Apollodorus remarks that he was the ﬁrst mortal to receive a vine from
Dionysos,75 and Hyginus provides a tale to explain how this came about. While

staying with Oineus as a guest, Dionysos fell in love with the wife of his host; and
when Oineus noticed this, he was considerate enough to remove himself from the
scene by pretending that he had to perform some sacred rites outside the city. So
Dionysos went to bed with Althaia, causing her to conceive Deianeira; and he
rewarded Oineus for his indulgent hospitality by giving him a vine-cutting and
instructing him in the cultivation of vines, and by decreeing that wine (oinos in
Greek) should be named after him.76 Or according to another tale, a certain
Staphylos, who worked for Oineus as a herdsman, noticed that one of his goats liked
to eat the fruit of an unfamiliar plant (i.e. a vine) and skipped around in a friskier
fashion afterwards. On receiving some of the fruit from his herdsman, Oineus
prepared a new drink from it and offered some to Dionysos, who proceeded to instruct
him in the cultivation of vines, decreeing that the drink should be named after him
and that its source (i.e. staphyloi, bunches of grapes) should be named after
Staphylos.77
The early historian and geographer Hecataeus offers a wholly different account of the origin
of the cultivation of grapes, providing Oineus with a different genealogy at the same time.
In very early times, a son of Deukalion called Orestheus travelled to Aetolia to establish a
kingdom there. When a dog happened to give birth to a plant-stem, he ordered that it
should be buried in the ground; and a vine sprang up from it yielding a profusion of grapes.
In commemoration of this incident, he named his son Phytios (he who causes to grow), and
Phytios subsequently named his own son Oineus after the vines (oinai, an old-fashioned name
for vines, which were usually called ampeloi in later times). Aitolos, the eponym of the land,
was a child of Oineus rather than of Endymion in this account.78
In his surviving myths at least, Oineus is not presented as a warlike ﬁgure, but as
a gracious ruler who was always ready to offer hospitality and refuge to strangers
from abroad. The Iliad reports that he once entertained Bellerophon at his home for
twenty days and exchanged splendid gifts with him;79 he offered refuge to Alkmaion
for a time when that hero was being persecuted by the Furies (see p. 327), and to
the young Agamemnon and Menelaos after the murder of their father (see p. 508);
and Herakles stayed with him for some years after marrying his daughter Deianeira,
until an unfortunate accident caused the hero to seek a new home (see p. 280).
Meleagros and the hunt for the Calydonian boar
A most remarkable event occurred soon after the birth of MELEAGROS (Meleager
in Latin); for either on the day of his birth or seven days afterwards (i.e. at the time
when a Greek child would normally be given its name), the Moirai (Fates) appeared
to his mother Althaia and revealed that her son’s life would come to an end when
a log that was burning in the hearth was fully consumed. In the relatively elabo-
rate account by Hyginus, one of the sisters declared that Meleagros would be
noble-hearted, and another that he would be brave, but the third sister Atropos
(who was the one who the cut the thread of life to bring people’s lives to an end)
looked toward a brand that was burning in hearth and said, ‘He will live as long
as that brand remains unconsumed’. However the warning was delivered, Althaia
— The history of the Deukalionids —
414

leapt up from her bed in response and removed the log to a place of safety, shut-
ting it up in a chest in most accounts. It appears that she kept the matter secret
from everyone else, including her son. According to Apollodorus at least, Meleagros
was invulnerable as long as the log was kept safe.80
Before taking the lead in the greatest adventure in Aetolian legend, Meleagros
sailed with the Argonauts,81 and won a victory with his javelin at the funeral games
for Pelias.82 His name appears in all surviving catalogues of the Argonauts; since
he was little more than an adolescent at the time, Oineus arranged for him to be
accompanied by his maternal uncle Iphiklos, and also another uncle, Laokoon 
(a half-brother of the king). Maternal uncles often played a role in the initiation of
young men. Meleagros comes out well in Apollonius’ Argonautica, killing two of
the enemy during the battle with the Doliones (see p. 384), and even offering, young
as he was, to perform the tasks that were set as a condition for the removing of the
ﬂeece (although they would ultimately be performed by Jason); the poet remarks
that none of the Argonauts was superior to him save Herakles alone.83
Meleagros was best remembered as the young man who had led many of the fore-
most heroes of Greece in the hunt for the Calydonian boar, and had perished soon
after he had killed the beast as the result of a quarrel over the allocation of the

trophies. The great hunt had come to be convened in the following circumstances.
When Oineus was once offering the ﬁrst-fruits of his harvest (or simply a general
sacriﬁce) to all the gods one year, he happened to forget Artemis, who was so angry
that she sent a boar of unparalleled size and ferocity against the land; and it uprooted
the crops, destroyed the livestock and killed anyone who was unfortunate enough
to encounter it.84 Although Oineus tried to appease the goddess with sacriﬁces of
goats and red-backed oxen, her anger persisted,85 and he summoned leading heroes
from far and wide to hunt the boar, promising its hide as a prize of honour to the
one who killed it.86 Since the king was now too old to venture into the ﬁeld himself,
Meleagros took command of the assembled force. Among the heroes who responded
to the challenge were Jason and a number of former Argonauts, Theseus and his
friend Peirithoos, Peleus and his brother Telamon, Ankaios and Kepheus from
Arcadia, Idas and Lynkeus from Messenia, the Dioskouroi from Sparta, and Admetos
and Eurytion from Thessaly. The hunt took place after the voyage of the Argonauts
but before the Theban War; if Amphiaraos joined the hunt, as he did in one account,
he was the only boar-hunter who went on to march against Thebes. In addition to
all these heroes, a notable heroine, Atalanta, arrived from Arcadia to attend the
hunt, and played a leading part in it in most accounts. Apollodorus and Hyginus
provide useful catalogues of the hunters, as does Ovid in his Metamorphoses.87
Although the tale of the boar-hunt and the conﬂict that arose from it was almost
as famous as the tale of the Argonauts, it so happens that no very important account
of it has survived. For the course of the hunt itself, Apollodorus and Ovid should
be consulted ﬁrst of all, together with the earlier though less complete account in
Bacchylides’ ﬁfth Ode.88 When the boar-hunters set off on their mission after nine
days of feasting, Kepheus, Ankaios and some of the other men were reluctant to
take to the ﬁeld in the company of a woman, but Meleagros insisted that Atalanta
should be allowed to come. As it turned out, she proved to be a more valiant and
effective hunter than any of the men, apart from Meleagros himself. According to
Bacchylides, the hunt lasted for six days and the main victims of the boar were
Ankaios (a redoubtable Arcadian who wore a bearskin and carried a double-headed
axe, see p. 544) and Meleagros’ favourite brother Agelaos. Others who are named
as victims in later sources are Ainesimos, who was a son of Hippokoon from Sparta,
and a certain Hyleus89 (and even, rather absurdly, Ixion and Telamon90). Many 
more were wounded, and some were killed accidentally by fellow-hunters, notably
Eurytion, king of Phthia, who died at the hand of Peleus (see p. 533). Ovid mentions
that dogs and hunting-nets were employed, as would be expected; the dogs can 
be seen much earlier in vase-paintings, which sometimes even attribute names to
individual hounds.
It was generally agreed that the boar was killed by Meleagros after ﬁrst being
wounded by Atalanta. According to Apollodorus, Atalanta landed the initial blow
by shooting an arrow into its back, and Amphiaraos then proceeded to shoot it in
the eye, leaving it for Meleagros to deal the death-blow by stabbing it in the side;
or in Ovid’s account, Atalanta shot it beneath the ear, and Meleagros ﬁnished it off
by hurling a spear into its back and driving another spear through its shoulders.91
The Hellenistic poet Lycophron departs from the usual pattern by suggesting that
Ankaios killed the boar after being fatally wounded by it.92
— The history of the Deukalionids —
416

The death of Meleagros
The story might well have ended happily at this point if Meleagros, as the slayer
of the beast, had chosen to keep the prize of honour for himself; but he decided to
award the hide and tusks to Atalanta instead, either out of admiration for her valour
and skill93 or because he had fallen in love with her.94 By making this gesture, he
inadvertently provoked a quarrel with his maternal uncles, the sons of Thestios, who
protested that the prize should go to them by right of birth rather than to a woman
and a foreigner if their nephew chose not to take it. When they advanced from
words to action by seizing the hide from Atalanta, Meleagros ﬂew into a rage and
killed them, and so incurred his own destruction; for his mother Althaia was so
furious to hear that he had killed her brothers that she rekindled the log on which
his life depended, and he expired as soon as it was burnt away.95 His sisters wept
for him so inconsolably that Artemis took pity on them and transformed them into
guinea-fowl (meleagrides). Deianeira and Gorge were left unchanged, however, at the
request of Dionysos, and so survived to marry Herakles and Andraimon respectively
as ancient tradition demanded.96
In some accounts, including the earliest in the Iliad, the quarrel between
Meleagros and his uncles developed into a full-scale war. There is no mention of
Atalanta in Homer’s version, or of the folk-tale motif of the log. We are told,
without further detail, that Artemis provoked a dispute between the Aetolians (i.e.
Calydonians) and the Kouretes over the head and shaggy hide of the dead boar, and
that all went badly for the Kouretes as long as Meleagros remained in the fray; but
when his mother cursed him for killing one of her brothers (or some of her brothers,
for the text is ambiguous), he withdrew from the ﬁghting in anger, and the Kouretes
gained the advantage and launched a threatening assault against Calydon. As the
Kouretes pressed the city ever harder, the holiest priests were sent to Meleagros by
the elders to entreat him to return to the ﬁghting and to offer him gifts if he would
do so; and he was then visited in succession by his father, and his sisters, and Althaia
herself, and his dearest comrades, but he remained obdurate until his wife Kleopatra
reminded him of the miseries of death and enslavement that awaited the inhabit-
ants of a fallen city. So he rejoined the ﬁghting and won the day for his people.97
His defeated opponents, the Kouretes, may presumably be identiﬁed as the people
of Pleuron, the city that was ruled by Thestios and his family.
Although Homer does not state explicitly that Meleagros was killed in the conﬂict,
we are perhaps meant to infer this from Althaia’s curse; for we are told that she
beat the earth with her hands, calling on Hades and Persephone to cause his death,
and, ominously, that the ‘Erinys who walks in darkness, and has no pity in her
heart, heard her from Erebos’.98 If the story is viewed in its context in the epic, it
is understandable that Homer should have been vague on the matter since Phoinix
recounts the story as a paradigm while trying to persuade Achilles to return to the
ﬁghting at Troy (after he has withdrawn as the result of a dispute with Agamemnon,
see p. 463). According to a fragment from the Hesiodic Catalogue, Apollo shot
Meleagros as he was ﬁghting against the Kouretes outside Pleuron; and Meleagros
is reported to have suffered the same fate in an early epic called the Minyas.99 Apollo
was presumably acting on behalf of his sister Artemis. It seems likely that the rest

of the story in these two poems would have followed much the same course as in
the Iliad, but this cannot be known for certain. Apollodorus offers an account of
the Homeric version of the myth as an alternative after ﬁrst recounting the stan-
dard later version. War broke out between the Kouretes and the Calydonians, so he
tells us, when the sons of Thestios laid claim to the hide on the ground that one
of them, Iphiklos by name, had been the ﬁrst to hit the boar (a detail not derived
from the Iliad). After sallying out against the Kouretes, Meleagros killed some sons
of Thestios, and his mother cursed him for it, causing him such anger that he stayed
in his home thereafter. He ﬁnally emerged, however, in response to the supplica-
tions of his wife, and killed the surviving sons of Thestios before meeting his own
death in the ﬁghting.100
Meleagros was married to Kleopatra, the daughter of Idas and Marpessa; Apollodorus reports
that she hanged herself after his death.101 In the Cypria, an early epic in the Trojan cycle,
Protesilaos was said to have been married to Polydora, a presumably legitimate daughter of
Meleagros102 (rather than to Laodameia as in subsequent tradition, see p. 450); but there is
otherwise no mention of any children from the marriage. Parthenopaios, one of the Seven
against Thebes, was sometimes described as a son of Meleagros by Atalanta.103
One should not necessarily assume that Homer was unacquainted with the tale of the
magical brand just because he omits it from his account of the story of Meleagros. Fairytale
motifs of this kind, some surely of great antiquity, appear with special frequently in the
mythology of the Deukalionids; and it is quite possible that the tale of the brand was already
familiar in Homer’s time but was ignored by him as being out of place in high epic. The
early Attic tragedian Phrynichos is the ﬁrst author who is deﬁnitely known to have written
about it.104
The later life of Oineus, and his successors at Calydon
After the death of Althaia, who hanged or stabbed herself in remorse after the death
of her son,105 Oineus married Periboia, daughter of Hipponoos, who was descended
from the old Inachid ruling family of Argos. She bore Oineus a single son only in
the usual tradition, but a very notable one, TYDEUS, who was one of the Seven
against Thebes (see p. 317).106 An alternative tradition which ﬁrst appears in the
Hellenistic period suggests that Oineus fathered Tydeus by one of his own daugh-
ters, Gorge, after Zeus had inspired him with an incestuous passion for her for some
unstated reason.107 Tydeus grew up to become a promising young man, but was
soon obliged to depart into exile after killing one or more of his relations. According
to the Hesiodic Catalogue, he slew his paternal uncles because they were plotting
against his father; or else he killed some cousins of his, the sons of Melas or Agrios,
for similar reasons. Or in another set of accounts, he accidentally killed a brother
of his, usually named as Olenias or Melanippos.108 He sought refuge at Argos, where
the king, Adrastos, not only offered him hospitality but also gave his daughter
Deipyle to him as a wife (see p. 316 for the circumstances). Adrastos promised to
restore him to his original homeland, but Tydeus was killed at Thebes (see p. 320)
before the promise could be put into effect. He left a son, Diomedes, who was
destined to become a hero of even greater stature than himself. When Adrastos died
after having lost his only son in the second Theban War, Diomedes inherited his
— The history of the Deukalionids —
418

kingdom as his grandson in the female line (see p. 333), and he subsequently
commanded the men of Argos, Tiryns and the eastern Argolid at Troy.
All manner of tales were recounted to explain how Oineus came to acquire his second wife
Periboia. Her father Hipponoos, who was also the father of Kapaneus, ruled at Olenos in
Achaea. According to the Hesiodic Catalogue, he discovered that Periboia had been seduced
by Hippostratos, son of Amarynkeus, a member of the Eleian royal family, and sent her away
to Oineus to be put to death (evidently because he lived at a suitably remote distance); but
Oineus chose to take her as his wife instead. Or in the Thebais, a poem in the epic cycle,
Oineus won her as a prize of war after attacking her father’s city.109 Or when she became preg-
nant and told her father that Ares was to blame, he sent her away to Oineus to be killed
(presumably because he thought that she was trying to cover up a love affair with a mortal),
and the bereaved king married her as usual. Or Hipponoos discovered that she had been
seduced by Oineus himself, and sent her away with him on learning that she was pregnant.110
When Oineus grew too old to retain proper control of his kingdom, some nephews
of his, the sons of Agrios, revolted against him to place their father on the throne;
and they not only robbed him of his birthright but imprisoned him and cruelly
mistreated him. He found a saviour, however, in his grandson Diomedes, who rushed
to his rescue together with Alkmaion (a great Argive hero who became the leader
of the Epigonoi, see p. 325). The two of them stole into Aetolia and killed all the
sons of Agrios apart from two alone, Thersites and Onchestos, who had escaped to
the Peloponnese beforehand. Realizing that Oineus was no longer capable of ruling
in security, Diomedes transferred his kingdom to his son-in-law Andraimon and
took him away to the Peloponnese.111 In one version of the story, Oineus arrived
safely in Argos, where he was tended by Diomedes until he died; or else he was
murdered on the way by the two surviving sons of Agrios, who ambushed him in
Arcadia at a place known as the Hearth of Telephos. For the subsequent career of
Thersites, which was equally disreputable, see pp. 466–7; nothing further is recorded
of his brother Onchestos. As for Oineus, he was buried in the western Argolid what-
ever the circumstances of his death, at the city of Oinoe, hence its name.112
In another account of these events, Diomedes expelled Agrios (or killed him and
his sons) after the Trojan War with the aid of Sthenelos, son of Kapaneus, and
restored Oineus to the throne;113 but this is implausible in terms of any rational
chronology. Oineus was proverbial for the misfortunes of his old age.114
Nothing is recorded of the birth and origin of ANDRAIMON, who succeeded
to the Calydonian throne because he was married to Oineus’ daughter Gorge. He
was also associated with Amphissa, the main city of Western Locris; indeed, he was
supposed to have been buried there in a joint tomb with his wife.115 His son THOAS
appears in the Iliad as the leader of the Aetolian contingent at Troy.116 Although
mentioned occasionally in the epic as a respected chieftain, he does not stand out
as a hero of individual character or achievement. In the Little Iliad, a later epic in
the Trojan cycle, he inﬂicted wounds on Odysseus to make him unrecognizable when
he made his secret incursion into Troy in the closing stages of the war (see p. 472);
and he is listed among the warriors who hid in the Wooden Horse.117 He probably
resumed power in Calydon after the war in the early tradition, although he was
sometimes said to have settled abroad in Italy.118 According to the local tradition

at Amphissa, the bronze temple-statue of Athena in her sanctuary on the acropolis
had been brought back from Troy by Thoas as part of the spoils of the war.119
Apollodorus records a curious tale in which Odysseus is said to have taken refuge
with Thoas after being exiled from his homeland for killing Penelope’s suitors, and
to have married an unnamed daughter of the king, who bore him a son called
Leontophonos.120 Haimon, the son and successor of Thoas, was the father of
Oxylos,121 who acted as guide to the Heraklids during their ﬁnal invasion of the
Peloponnese (see p. 289). As a reward for his services, Oxylos asked to be granted
the throne of Elis, which had been ruled by his ancestors many generations earlier
before the departure of Aitolos.
THE SONS OF AIOLOS AND THEIR 
DESCENDANTS
The sons of Aiolos and their families will be considered in the following order: (1)
Athamas, (2) Salmoneus, (3) Perieres, (4) Kretheus, (5) Sisyphos, (6) Deion, and (7)
Magnes.
We have already encountered the Boeotian ruler Athamas in connection with the
rearing of Dionysos (see p. 172) and the origin of the golden ﬂeece (see p. 377); he
was of signiﬁcance for the stories that were told of him and his immediate family
rather than as the founder of a dynasty. Salmoneus established a kingdom in the
north-western Peloponnese, but soon provoked the destruction of his household and
city by his impious behaviour; his daughter Tyro, the only member of his family
to survive, became the wife of his brother Kretheus, who had remained in Thessaly.
Perieres emigrated to the Peloponnese like Salmoneus, but settled further south in
Messenia, where he founded an early ruling line. Kretheus was the founder of Iolkos
in Thessaly; since we have already considered the careers of his son Aison and
grandson Jason in connection with the Argonautic expedition, we will concentrate
here on the other branches of his family that were descended from his son Pheres,
who founded Pherai to the west of Iolkos, and his son Amythaon, who emigrated
to Messenia and founded an important family of seers and Argive rulers. Sisyphos
was the cunning founder of the early Corinthian royal line. And ﬁnally, there were
two brothers of lesser importance, Deion, who was associated with Phocis in Central
Greece, and Magnes, who was the eponym of Magnesia on the Thessalian coast,
and the father of Diktys and Polydektes, who have been mentioned for the part that
they played in the legend of Perseus.
Athamas and his wives
ATHAMAS was a Boeotian king who was remembered for the misfortunes of his
family life and for the part that he played in the rearing of Dionysos. He was some-
times said to have ruled at Orchomenos in north-western Boeotia, or else at Thebes
(although there is no proper place for him in the succession).122 There were many
divergent accounts of his marriages and of the conﬂicts that arose from them.
According to the standard tradition, however, as has been recounted in connection
— The history of the Deukalionids —
420

with the golden ﬂeece, he ﬁrst married a minor goddess, NEPHELE (Cloud), who
bore him two children, Phrixos and Helle, but he later put her aside to marry a
Theban princess, Ino, daughter of Kadmos, who bore him two further children,
Learchos and Melikertes. Ino was jealous of her stepchildren, as we have seen, and
would have caused their death (or at least the death of Phrixos) if Nephele had not
arranged for them to be carried away from Greece on a golden ram (see p. 378).123
In a variation on the standard account, Athamas married Ino ﬁrst, but subsequently
put her aside at the order of Hera to marry Nephele; he continued to see Ino in
secret, however, and when Nephele eventually discovered this and abandoned him,
Ino recovered her former position and then plotted the death of Nephele’s children
in the same way as in the usual story.124
Athamas was later deprived of his other children too in tragic circumstances. In
one account, he came to discover that Ino had plotted the death of his previous
children, and was so angry that he killed Learchos, the elder of the two sons whom
she had borne to him, and chased after Ino herself, causing her to jump into the
sea in terror with her infant son Melikertes in her arms.125 In the more favoured
version, however, Hera caused the death of the two children by sending Ino and
Athamas mad, to punish them for having reared Dionysos, an illegitimate child of
Zeus (see p. 172). In his frenzy, Athamas hunted Learchos down and shot him in
the belief that he was a deer, while Ino threw Melikertes into a cauldron of boiling
water and then jumped into the sea with him.126 Or in Ovid’s version, Athamas
tracked down Ino and her two children in the belief that she was a lioness with
two cubs, and snatched Learchos from her arms and hurled him through the air,
causing him to smash his head against a rock. Now utterly distraught, Ino rushed
away with Melikertes in her arms, howling like a wild beast, and hurled herself
into the sea.127 Dionysos (or in Ovid’s account, Aphrodite) took pity on Ino and
turned her into a minor sea-goddess, Leukothea (the White Goddess), whom we
shall encounter again as the saviour of Odysseus (see pp. 497–8). Melikertes was
also deiﬁed, under the name of Palaimon.128
After these events, Athamas was banished from his kingdom and set off to seek a
new home. When he consulted the oracle at Delphi, he was advised to settle at a place
where he was offered hospitality by wild animals. As he was passing through Thessaly
after lengthy wanderings, he ran across some wolves which were sharing out the
remains of a dead sheep; and when they ﬂed at the sight of him, leaving their food
behind, he recognized that the oracle had been fulﬁlled. So he made his home in that
region, which was known as the Athamantian Plain from that time onward. He now
married yet again, taking THEMISTO, a daughter of the Thessalian hero Hypseus,
as his third wife. Of the four sons of this marriage, only Schoineus is worthy of
mention, as the father of Atalanta in the Boeotian tradition (see p. 546).129
Some sources suggest that Athamas married Themisto while he was still in Boeotia. In
Pherecydes’ account of his marital affairs, she apparently took the place of Ino as the wicked
stepmother who plotted the death of Nephele’s children.130 Or in a tale recorded by Hyginus,
Athamas married Ino ﬁrst of all, fathering Learchos and Melikertes by her as usual, but
formed a union with Themisto when Ino disappeared in mysterious circumstances. He later
discovered, however, that Ino was not dead as he had supposed, but had simply left home

to participate in Bacchic revels on Mt Parnassos, and he brought her back into the house
under a concealed identity, pretending to Themisto that she was merely a maidservant.
Themisto, who assumes the role of the wicked stepmother in this version, wanted to kill
her predecessor’s children, and conﬁded her plans to the supposed maidservant, telling her
to dress the prospective victims in black and the new children in white to ensure that there
would be no mistake. But Ino dressed Themisto’s children in black clothes to ensure that
they would be killed instead; and when Themisto discovered what she had done, she took
her own life.131
A combined version is also recorded in which Athamas ﬁrst married Nephele, and then
Themisto, and ﬁnally Ino. Nephele and Ino bore their usual children to him, while Themisto
bore him two sons called Sphinkios and Orchomenos. After being displaced by Ino, Themisto
hid in the palace with the intention of killing Ino’s children; but she killed her own chil-
dren instead because the nurse had put the wrong clothes on them, and committed suicide
as a consequence.132
The impious Salmoneus and his destruction
SALMONEUS settled in Elis in the north-western Peloponnese, where he 
founded a city beside the river Alpheios, naming it Salmone after himself. He
doomed himself to an early death, however, by usurping the prerogatives of Zeus.
Not only did he call himself Zeus and demand that he should receive the sacriﬁces
that had formerly been offered to the king of the gods, but imitated his thunder
by dragging bronze kettles and animal hides behind his chariot, and imitated his
lightning by hurling blazing torches up into the sky. Zeus punished his imperti-
nence by striking him with a genuine thunderbolt, and proceeded to destroy his
entire city along with its inhabitants (presumably because they had acceded to the
will of Salmoneus by honouring him as Zeus).133 It has long been suspected that
this legend contains a recollection of weather-magic, in which the actions here
ascribed to insane presumption would have been performed to induce rain-storms
through sympathetic magic.
During his short life, Salmoneus married Alkidike, daughter of Aleos, who bore
him a daughter of considerable importance, TYRO.134 As we have seen in the
preceding chapter (see p. 380), she was entrusted to her uncle Kretheus after her
father’s death, and bore some notable sons to him and to the god Poseidon.
According to the Hesiodic Catalogue, Zeus spared Tyro alone when he destroyed the
city of Salmoneus because she had constantly rebuked her father for putting himself
on a level with the gods.135
The families of Perieres and Neleus in Messenia
PERIERES emigrated to the Peloponnese like his brother Salmoneus, settling in
Messenia in the south-west. He established himself as the ruler of the land and
married Gorgophone, a daughter of Perseus, whose name (Gorgon-slayer) referred
to that hero’s greatest exploit. She bore him two sons, Aphareus and Leukippos,
who inherited the kingdom after his death.136 Although they were ostensibly joint
rulers, APHAREUS held most of the power. He married Arene, a daughter of
Oibalos, king of Sparta, and fathered twin sons, Idas and Lynkeus, who are the ﬁrst
— The history of the Deukalionids —
422

members of the line to have any proper myths.137 Arene was the eponym of an old
Messenian town which is mentioned in the Iliad as lying within Nestor’s domain.138
Although IDAS and LYNKEUS, who were known jointly as the Apharetidai (Sons
of Aphareus), usually acted in conjunction, Idas performed one notable exploit of
his own when he abducted Marpessa from her native Aetolia and won her as his
wife in the face of competition from Apollo (see p. 153). There is a reference to
this legend in the Iliad, which describes Idas as the mightiest man of his time.139
Marpessa bore him a single child, Kleopatra, who became the wife of Meleagros (see
p. 418).140 His brother Lynkeus was proverbial for the exceptional and indeed
magical keenness of his eyesight,141 which he used to good effect in the brothers’
greatest adventure (see p. 528); no individual exploits are recorded for him, and he
apparently never married. It was naturally assumed the brothers participated in the
main adventures of their time by sailing with the Argonauts and joining the hunt
for the Calydonian boar;142 but they were remembered above all for their conﬂict
with their Spartan neighbours, the Dioskouroi, which proved fatal to both sets of
twins (see pp. 527ff).
Hyginus records an eccentric tale that suggests that Idas crossed over to Asia Minor at some
stage and tried to rob Teuthras, king of Mysia, of his throne. Teuthras called on the aid of
Telephos, who had crossed over to Asia Minor in search of his mother Auge (see p. 543),
and Telephos defeated Idas in battle with the help of Parthenopaios (whose presence is left
unexplained).143

Figure 12.2

Siphnian treasury, Delphi.

LEUKIPPOS, who ruled alongside Aphareus in Messenia, had two daughters,
HILAEIRA and PHOIBE (the Leukippides),144 who were abducted to Sparta by the
Dioskouroi; in some but not all accounts, this was the incident that provoked the
confrontation between the Apharetidai and the Dioskouroi, since the girls were
already betrothed to their Messenian cousins (see p. 527).
According to a Peloponnesian tradition, Apollo fathered the great healer Asklepios by
ARSINOE, a further daughter of Leukippos, rather than by Koronis in Thessaly as was
commonly believed (see p. 149).145 Pausanias reports that an Arcadian once enquired about
the matter at Delphi, and was told on the authority of Apollo himself that the Thessalian
tradition was correct.146 The Messenians liked to believe nonetheless that part of their land
had once been ruled by Asklepios, and later by his sons Machaon and Podaleirios, whose
supposed tombs could be seen in that land at Gerenia and Pharai respectively.147
When NELEUS was expelled from Thessaly by his brother Pelias (see p. 380), he
sought refuge in Messenia and received a friendly welcome from Aphareus, who
offered him a strip of land on the coast. Through his mother Tyro (who had borne
him and his twin brother to Poseidon, see p. 380), he was of course of Aiolid descent
like his host. Among the towns that he came to rule as a result of Aphareus’
generosity was Pylos – the ‘sandy Pylos’ familiar from Homer – where he settled and
built his palace. He married Chloris, a daughter of Amphion, king of Orchomenos,
who bore twelve mighty sons to him, including the shape-shifter Periklymenos and
Nestor as the youngest; but Neleus later brought disaster on himself and his family
by offending Herakles, who mounted an expedition against Pylos and killed him and
all of sons apart from Nestor, who was still below military age (see further on p. 278).
In the course of his reign, Neleus welcomed his cousin Amythaon, son of Kretheus,
to his city of Pylos (see p. 426); for the story of how Amythaon’s son Melampous won
Neleus’ only daughter, Pero, as a wife for his brother Bias, see pp. 426–7.148
NESTOR proved to be more fortunate than his father, for he not only survived
into old age but added greatly to his inheritance. As will be apparent from the
preceding account, Idas and Lynkeus were the only male descendants of Perieres in
the second generation; and when they met an early death before the Trojan War as
a result of their quarrel with the Dioskouroi, the lands that had belonged to Perieres
and his descendants passed into the possession of Nestor.149 Accompanied by two
of his sons, Antilochos and Thrasymedes, Nestor led the men of Pylos and other
Messenian towns to Troy,150 and returned home safely afterwards. Antilochos was
killed towards the end of the war while rescuing his father from Memnon, a foreign
ally of the Trojans (see p. 468). The third book of the Odyssey describes how Nestor
received Telemachos, the young son of Odysseus, at the Pylian court shortly after
the war. For his characterization in the Iliad, see p. 460. In the time of his great-
grandchildren, his entire family was expelled from Messenia by the Heraklids (see
p. 290); but this calamity did not cause the ﬁnal eclipse of the Neleid family, since
one of the exiles, Melanthos, won the throne of Athens (see p. 376), and Neleids
were said to have led the Ionians in their settlement of the coast of Asia Minor 
(in legend at least, see p. 409). The great Athenian family of the Alkmaionidai
— The history of the Deukalionids —
424

(Alcmaeonids), of which Kleisthenes and Perikles were noted members, was supposed
to have been founded by a Neleid exile, Alkmaion, son of Sillos, a great-grandson
of Neleus.151
To summarize, Perieres established an Aiolid line in Messenia which ruled the
entire province until his son Aphareus granted a share of the coast-land to Neleus,
son of Poseidon and Tyro, who was also of Aiolid descent; and since Leukippos, the
other son of Perieres, had no male children and the sons of Aphareus died prema-
turely, the whole of the province fell under the control of the Neleid family when
it was headed by Nestor, son of Neleus.
It should be remarked that there were conﬂicting accounts of the birth and origin of Perieres,
since he was sometimes inserted into the Spartan royal line;152 but the genealogical questions
associated with this matter are too complicated and recondite to be worth examining here.
There is also record of a wholly different royal family that is said to have ruled Messenia in
very early times before the arrival of Perieres. This line was founded as a result of the ambi-
tion of MESSENE, daughter of Triopas, an Argive princess who married the younger son of
Lelex, the earthborn ﬁrst king of Sparta; for when the throne passed to Myles, the elder son
of Lelex, she urged her husband Polykaon to establish a kingdom of his own in the fertile
lands to the west. So he settled there with some Spartan and Argive followers, and named the
land Messenia after his wife.153 There was a temple of Messene in the city of that name154
(which was founded as the capital of the land after it was freed from the Spartans in the fourth
century BC), and images of her can be seen on Messenian coins. She was evidently a ﬁgure of
fairly late invention; after searching vainly for information about her family history in early
epic, Pausanias concluded that her line must have died out before Perieres arrived there several
generations later.155
Kretheus and his sons
KRETHEUS was the founder of the Thessalian city of Iolkos, which was best known
for its association with the Argonauts. He married Tyro, the daughter of his brother
Salmoneus, after initially acting as her guardian, and fathered three sons by her,
Aison, Pheres and Amythaon.156
Although AISON would have succeeded to the Iolkian throne in normal circum-
stances, his mother had previously borne twin sons to Poseidon, and one of these,
Pelias, became king of Iolkos instead (whether legitimately or by usurpation). Aison
remained in or near Iolkos, but sent his son Jason (properly Iason) into the country
to be reared by the Centaur Cheiron. The subsequent history of this branch of the
family and the career of Pelias have already been considered in connection with the
Argonauts. When Jason returned to Iolkos after fetching the golden ﬂeece, he
brought the sorceress Medeia, who contrived the death of Pelias; but Jason and
Medeia chose to leave afterwards (or were driven out), and the throne passed to
Akastos, the son of Pelias (see p. 398). As for Aison, who is a comparatively colour-
less ﬁgure, Pelias was usually said to have killed him while Jason was away with
the Argonauts (see p. 398).
Aison’s brother PHERES founded the Thessalian city of Pherai, which lay to the
west of Iolkos. He married Periklymene, daughter of Minyas, who bore him two
sons, Admetos and Lykourgos. ADMETOS succeeded to his father’s kingdom, which

was famous for its rich ﬂocks of sheep, and married ALKESTIS, the eldest daughter
of Pelias.157 The myths of this celebrated couple have already been recounted in
connection with Apollo (see pp. 151–2). Their son EUMELOS (rich in ﬂocks)
commanded the men of Pherai, Iolkos and the neighbouring towns during the Trojan
War; his magniﬁcent horses, which had been bred by Apollo, were the fastest at
Troy after the divine horses of Achilles.158 LYKOURGOS, the younger son of Pheres,
departed to the north-western corner of the Argolid to become the king of Nemea.
He was best remembered as the father of Opheltes, who was killed by a snake while
Adrastos and his followers were passing through Nemea on the way to Thebes (see
p. 318); as we have seen, this legend explained the origin of the Nemean Games,
one of the four great athletic festivals of ancient Greece. The supposed tomb of
Lykourgos could be seen at Nemea in historical times.159
Unlike his two brothers, AMYTHAON, the last of these sons of Kretheus, chose
to leave his native Thessaly, and settled with his half-brother Neleus at Pylos in
Messenia. He married Eidomene, a daughter of Pheres, and founded a notable family
of seers and wise heroes.160 The Hesiodic Catalogue characterizes the Amythaontids by
stating that they were distinguished by their intelligence (nous), just as the Aiakides
(the family of Achilles and Aias, see pp. 350ff) were distinguished by their strength,
and the Atreids (the family of Agamemnon and Menelaos) by their wealth.161
As is not uncommon with the founders of great mythical families, Amythaon has no
stories of his own; at the most, Pindar reports that he visited Iolkos to be present when
Jason came to demand the throne from Pelias.162
How Melampous gained his prophetic powers and won a bride
for his brother Bias
Amythaon had two sons, MELAMPOUS and BIAS, who eventually settled in the
Argolid, founding new royal lines there. Melampous became the ﬁnest seer of his
age, moreover, and founded a branch of the family that would produce many other
notable seers. He acquired his prophetic powers during his earlier years in the
following manner. While he was living in the country outside Pylos, his servants
killed some snakes which had made their home in an oak-tree outside his house;
and on learning of this, he gathered some wood to cremate the dead reptiles and
took care of their young. When the latter were fully grown, they came up to
Melampous while he was asleep one night and licked his ears with their tongues,
giving him the power to understand the speech of birds and other animals. He woke
up in a fright, but discovered at once that he could interpret the cries of the birds
in the sky above him; and from that time onwards, he was able to foretell the future
to his fellow mortals.163 Or in a slightly different account, a snake crept forward
and killed a servant as Melampous was attending a sacriﬁce at the court of a certain
Polyphates; and when the king killed the snake in its turn, Melampous buried it
and took care of its young, with the same consequences as above.164 Melampous also
acquired divinatory skills of a more technical kind by learning how to interpret the
entrails of sacriﬁcial animals, and proﬁted too from an encounter with Apollo, the
god of prophecy, beside the river Alpheios.165
— The history of the Deukalionids —
426

The interpretation of the ﬂights, cries and other actions of birds played an important part
in technical (as opposed to inspired) divination; in the tale above, which presents the seer
as learning the language of birds in a literal sense and so acquiring hidden knowledge from
them, we can recognize a mythical expression of this. As uncanny beasts that creep into
crevices of the earth, it is understandable that snakes should have been associated with divina-
tion and prophecy. They appear in a variety of contexts in tales of the mythical diviners. In
one account at least, Kassandra and her brother Helenos acquired their prophetic powers in
the same way as Melampous, when snakes licked their ears while they were lying overnight
in the shrine of Thymbraian Apollo at Troy (see p. 154).166 The seer Polyidos learned how
revive the dead Glaukos by observing the actions of a snake (see p. 353); the seer Teiresias
underwent his changes of sex as a result of meetings with snakes (see p. 329); and Iamos,
the founder of a clan of seers at Olympia, was fed by snakes when he was exposed as an
infant (see p. 548).
Melampous used his special powers to procure a wife for his brother Bias, and later
to win kingdoms in Argos for Bias and himself. Bias fell in love with Pero, the
only daughter of Neleus, who had so many suitors that her father exploited the
matter to his own advantage by promising to give her to the one who brought him
the cattle of PHYLAKOS (a son of the Aiolid Deion who lived at Phylake in
Thessaly, see p. 435). Knowing that this would be a hazardous task because the
cattle were guarded by a ﬁerce dog which neither man nor beast could approach,
Bias sought the assistance of Melampous, who agreed to perform the task on his
behalf. Before setting off, the seer predicted that he would be caught in the act as
he tried to steal the cattle, but that he would gain possession of them nonetheless
after suffering a year’s imprisonment. He was arrested just as he had foretold, and
when the year had almost passed, he heard some wood-worms talking together in
the roof of his cell; when one of them asked how much of the roof-beam had been
eaten away, others replied that very little was left. He hastily informed his jailers,
asking them to remove him to another cell; and as soon as they had done so, the
roof of his former cell collapsed. On learning of these events, Phylakos realized that
his prisoner must be gifted with exceptional powers. So he offered him his freedom
and the cattle besides if he could ﬁnd a cure for his son IPHIKLOS, who was afﬂicted
with impotence. For one day, as he had been gelding some rams, Phylakos had seen
his son misbehaving in some unspeciﬁed way and had chased after him with the
bloodied knife in his hand, causing him such a fright that he had become impotent.
Melampous soon discovered the cause of the impotence from a vulture, which told
him that he could achieve a cure if he scraped some rust from the knife into some
water and gave it to the young man to drink for ten days. The vulture informed
him, furthermore, that Phylakos had thrust the knife into the bark of a sacred oak-
tree (or a wild pear-tree), and that the bark had grown over it since. Melampous
sought out the knife and worked a cure in accordance with the vulture’s advice; and
Phylakos gave him the cattle as he had promised. After driving them south to Pylos,
the seer handed them over to Neleus, who then allowed Bias to marry his
daughter.167 For the further history of the family of Phylakos, see p. 435.

How Melampous won kingdoms for himself and Bias in the
Argolid; the Melampodid seers
After remaining in Pylos for a while, Melampous won kingdoms in the Argolid for
his brother and himself by delivering the daughters of Proitos, king of Tiryns, from
an attack of madness, or by delivering the women of Argos from a general outbreak
of madness (or, in a combined version, by curing the princesses and the other women
too). There can be few episodes in Greek myth in which the tradition is more
complex and inconsistent. To start with Pherecydes’ version, which was probably
quite ancient, Hera afﬂicted the daughters of Proitos with madness because they
had mocked the poverty of her Argive temple, saying that their father’s palace was
more splendid by far. After their madness had endured for ten years, Proitos sought
the help of Melampous, promising him a share of the kingdom and one of the
maidens as a wife if he could effect a cure; and the seer achieved it by appeasing
Hera with supplications and sacriﬁces.168 Although there is no mention of Bias in
the surviving summary, it is likely enough that Melampous shared his prize with
him as in the standard tradition. The lyric poet Bacchylides (died mid-ﬁfth century
BC) offers a similar account of the origin of the girls’ madness, but says that Proitos
contrived a cure through his own initiative by vowing a sacriﬁce of ﬁfty red-haired
cattle to Artemis, who then interceded with Hera to secure the removal of the
madness.169 In yet another account from the earlier tradition, in this case from the
Hesiodic Catalogue, Dionysos inﬂicted the madness on the princesses to punish them
for rejecting his rites, and Melampous worked the cure, winning a share of the land
for his brother too. Although the details have been lost, the girls behaved in a
wanton manner during their madness (perhaps by wandering around wholly or
partially unclothed as in some vase-paintings), and their bodies were covered with
scabs, and their hair dropped out.170
Herodotus offers a wholly different version of the story, stating that the Argives
fetched Melampous from Pylos when the women of the land were once afﬂicted by
a general outbreak of madness; but when he demanded half of the land as his fee
for the cure, they regarded the claim as outrageous and dispensed with his services.
Later, however, when still more of the women caught the disease, they approached
him once again, saying that they were willing to accept his terms. Now that the
situation had altered in his favour, he demanded even more from them, refusing to
act until they agreed to give Bias a share of the kingdom also. Herodotus does not
say who was ruling in Argos at the time, nor does he explain the cause of the
madness.171 According to Diodorus, there was an outbreak of madness of this kind
during the reign of Proitos’ grandson, Anaxagoras, son of Megapenthes; and it was
inﬂicted by Dionysos and cured by Melampous, who received two-thirds of the
kingdom as his reward and shared it with Bias. Pausanias also places the incident
in the reign of Anaxagoras.172 In all likelihood, there were two separate madness-
legends, one in which the daughters of Proitos were sent mad by Hera and another
in which the women of Argos were sent mad by Dionysos (apparently at a some-
what later period); and if that is so, Melampous would presumably have been
associated with one story alone in the ﬁrst place, perhaps the latter.
— The history of the Deukalionids —
428

We may conclude with Apollodorus’ account of the legend, which is clearly a
composite version. When the daughters of Proitos were driven mad, either by Hera
or by Dionysos (for both possibilities are indicated), they roamed through Arcadia
and the rest of the Peloponnese in a state of complete abandon. Although Melampous
offered to cure them in return for a third of the kingdom, Proitos considered 
this to be exorbitant and refused to pay; but when the other women went mad also,
abandoning their homes and even killing their own children, Proitos agreed to pay
the stipulated fee. Melampous now asked for more, however, demanding a third 
of the kingdom for Bias too. As soon as his terms were accepted, Melampous set
off with the most vigorous of the young men of Argos to drive the women out of
the wilds with shouts and ecstatic dancing. One of the three daughters of Proitos
died in the course of the proceedings, but the others were puriﬁed and cured along
with the rest of the women.173 Two other scraps of information are worth recording.
The early Argive mythographer Acusilaus states that the daughters of Proitos were
sent mad by Hera because they disparaged the wooden cultic image (xoanon) of the
goddess; and Vergil mentions that they believed themselves to be cows during their
madness, a detail which may be of early origin.174
Although Proitos had only two daughters named Lysippe and Iphianassa in the
account ascribed to Pherecydes, Apollodorus adds a third named Iphinoe (probably
in accord with the Hesiodic Catalogue), and most other sources agree that there were
three even if there is less agreement about their names. Apollodorus reports that
Melampous married Iphianassa (as does Pherecydes) while Iphinoe died in the chase
and Lysippe became the wife of Bias. The latter marriage is of little signiﬁcance,
however, since Bias’ children and heirs are always said to have been borne to him
by Pero. In Diodorus’ account, in which Melampous is said to have won his bride
by curing the women of Argos during the reign of Anaxagoras, he married
Iphianeira, a daughter of Megapenthes and sister of Anaxagoras.175
The royal lines founded by Melampous and Bias were destined to play a promi-
nent role in the subsequent history of the land, providing most of the Argive leaders
during the Theban Wars; Adrastos, for instance, was descended from Bias, and
Amphiaraos from Melampous. This aspect of the mythology of the Amythaontids
has been considered above in connection with the mythical history of Thebes (see
pp. 316ff and 332ff).
Melampous’ branch of the family was also noted for the many seers who were born from it.
This is already indicated in the Odyssey, which provides the greater part of the family tree in
Table 13176 (in which later additions are marked in italics). We have encountered
Amphiaraos, the elder (or eldest) son of Oikles, and his son Alkmaion, as leading warriors in
the Theban Wars. There were two important seers in this line (which was descended from
Antiphates, son of Melampous), Amphiaraos himself, who delivered oracles at his shrine at
Oropos during his posthumous existence (see p. 321), and his son Amphilochos, who was
the joint founder of an oracle at Mallos in Asia Minor (see p. 489).
According to the Odyssey,177 Mantios, the younger son of Melampous, had two sons,
Polypheides, who was granted the gift of prophecy by Apollo, and Kleitos, who was abducted
by Eos (Dawn) on account of his exceptional beauty. Polypheides settled at Hyperesia in
Achaea, where he delivered prophecies to all comers and fathered a son, Theoklymenos, who
was no less gifted as a seer. After killing one of his relations, Theoklymenos ﬂed from his

birthplace for fear of being killed in a vendetta, and sought refuge at Pylos on the Messenian
coast, where he met Telemachos, the son of Odysseus, who was about to sail home after
visiting Nestor and Menelaos. Fearing that he was still being pursued for the murder,
Theoklymenos asked to accompany Telemachos to Ithaca; and he was able to repay him soon
after their arrival by interpreting a striking omen for him. For when a hawk ﬂew by on the
right (i.e. the side of good omen) with a dove in its talons, and plucked out the dove’s feathers
so that they fell to the ground between Telemachos and his ship, Theoklymenos interpreted
this as meaning that his host’s family would maintain its supremacy on Ithaca.178 He later
told Penelope, furthermore, that this indicated that Odysseus was already in the land, plot-
ting evil for her suitors.179 While he was at the palace shortly before the massacre of the
suitors, he foresaw their death through a sinister vision; for the meat that they were eating
seemed to be spattered with blood, as did the walls and ceiling of the room, and the heads
and limbs of the suitors seemed to be shrouded in night, and the porch and courtyard of the
palace seemed to be thronged with ghosts.180 This is a passage of particular interest because
divination is practised through purely technical means elsewhere in the Homeric epics, by the
interpretation of bird-ﬂights and the like. Inspired divination can otherwise be recognized
only in a single passage in the Iliad, in which the seer Helenos apprehends a plan that the
gods have decided upon in their consultations.181
The most notable diviner in the family after Melampous himself and Amphiaraos was
Polyeidos (or Polyeides), son of Koiranos, who is ﬁrst mentioned in the Iliad as a rich and
noble Corinthian seer;182 he was descended either from Mantios, son of Melampous, or from
a further son of Melampous called Abas.183 His most famous myth, which tells how he found
a lost Cretan prince, Glaukos, and brought him back to life again, has been recounted in
connection with the family of Minos (see p. 353); his other stories are set in Corinth or the
neighbouring region. In a tale recorded by Pindar, he advised the Corinthian hero Bellerophon
on how to gain divine help in taming the winged horse Pegasos (see p. 434); and according
to a local tradition at Megara, he once travelled there to purify Alkathoos after he had acci-
dentally killed his son Kallipolis (see p. 567).184 When Iphitos, son of Eurytos, was travelling
from city to city in search of his stolen horses (see p. 273), he met Polyeidos, who vainly urged
him not to take his search to Tiryns, where he was destined to be murdered by Herakles.185
The Iliad mentions the seer in connection with his son Euchenor, who was shot by Paris
during the Trojan War. When Polyeidos had told him before the war that he would either
die of a grievous illness in his own halls or be killed by the Trojans among the Greek ships,
Euchenor had preferred the prospect of the latter death to that of a hateful sickness, reckoning
that this would also save him from having to pay compensation to Agamemnon, the overlord
of Corinth, for not joining him on the expedition.186
The Klytidai, a clan of seers at Olympia, claimed to be descended from Melampous
through a certain Klytios, who was a son of Alkmaion by his ﬁrst wife, Arsinoe, daughter
of Phegeus. Since Alkmaion was murdered by the sons of Phegeus (see p. 327), it could
easily be explained that Klytios had left Arcadia to settle at Olympia because he had been
unwilling to live at his grandfather’s court in the presence of his father’s murderers.187
Sisyphos, king of Corinth, and his son Glaukos
SISYPHOS was the founder of the Deukalionid ruling family at Corinth. Homer
alludes to him in the Iliad as the most cunning of men who lived at that city of
Ephyre ‘in a corner of horse-breeding Argos’.188 Although it is far from certain that
this was the same place as Corinth, the two cities were commonly identiﬁed in the
subsequent tradition, and the myths of the Sisyphids were annexed to Corinth even
— The history of the Deukalionids —
430

if they did not originally belong to the city. The main features of the family history
were established at an early date, for Homer already describes Sisyphos as a son of
Aiolos and as the grandfather of the great Bellerophon through his son Glaukos.
His craftiness remained the deﬁning aspect of his character in the later tradition,
in which he is generally portrayed as an appealing rogue. As we have already seen
(p. 117), he was subjected to unending torment in the Underworld, either for having
betrayed a secret of Zeus or for having cheated death when he died on the ﬁrst occa-
sion. The following story lay behind both explanations. When Zeus abducted Aigina,
a daughter of the river-god Asopos, from her birthplace in the northern Peloponnese
(see p. 530), he took her through the territory of Sisyphos, who informed her father
about the matter in return for the creation of a spring on Corinthian acropolis. Zeus
was so angry that he sent Thanatos (Death personiﬁed) to haul him down to the
Underworld; but Sisyphos contrived to tie up Thanatos, so making it impossible
for anyone else to die until Ares ﬁnally set him free and delivered Sisyphos to him.
This was not the end of the matter, however, since Sisyphos had another trick in
hand. Before departing, he told his wife not to perform the proper funeral rites for
him; and on arriving below, he complained of this to Hades and Persephone, and
asked to be allowed to make a brief visit to the upper world to remind his wife of
her duties. After making his escape by this means, he simply remained at Corinth
until he died for a second time, of old age.189
Although this story of his double death was by far his most famous myth, there
were also tales that brought him into contact with two other masters of deception
and trickery, Odysseus and the greatest of all thieves, Autolykos (who was the
maternal grandfather of Odysseus). Sisyphos once engaged in a contest of wits with
Autolykos, whose father Hermes, the patron god of thievery, had granted him the
power to escape detection when he stole and to alter the appearance of what he had
stolen. He was thus able to alter the colour and markings of cattle, for instance, or
to give them horns or remove their horns; and he once made use of his skills to
steal large numbers of cattle from the herds of Sisyphos. Although Sisyphos was
convinced that Autolykos was stealing from him since his own herds were dimin-
ishing as those of Autolykos increased, he was unable to prove it because the
appearance of his cattle had been altered. So he set a trap for the thief by marking
the hooves of his cattle with his name or the inscription ‘Autolykos stole me’; and
when Autolykos repeated his depredations, he followed him to his home on Mt
Parnassos, identiﬁed the stolen cattle from the tell-tale inscriptions, and reclaimed
all that had been taken from him. It is claimed in this tale that Sisyphos fathered
the wily Odysseus during his visit, for he secretly seduced Autolykos’ daughter
Antikleia, causing her to become pregnant with Odysseus, who was reared by her
husband Laertes as his own son after her marriage.190
Nothing is reported of Sisyphos’ activities as a ruler except that he was supposed
to have founded the Isthmian Games in honour of Melikertes (see p. 421) after the
boy’s body was put ashore on the Isthmus of Corinth by a dolphin.191
According to the standard tradition, Corinth/Ephyre was founded by Sisyphos and ruled by
his family thereafter until it was seized by the Heraklid Aletes (see p. 290); but the
Corinthian epic poet Eumelos offered a wholly different account of the city’s earlier history,

suggesting that the territory of Corinth was initially awarded to Aietes by his father, the
sun-god Helios, and was subsequently ruled by his daughter Medeia. According to Eumelos,
Helios assigned the Ephyraean land (i.e. the region of Corinth) to Aietes, and the adjoining
Asopian land (i.e. the region of Sicyon to the west) to another son of his, Aloeus. Aietes left
for Colchis, however, where he would later be visited by Jason and the Argonauts (see p.
389), and entrusted his Ephyraean patrimony to a certain Bounos, son of Hermes. After the
death of Bounos, both territories fell under the control of Epopeus, son of Aloeus, who
bequeathed them to his son Marathon. To escape his father’s violence and lawlessness, Mara-
thon took refuge in Attica (hence the name of the village of Marathon in the north-east),
only making a brief visit to his original homeland after his father’s death to divide it between
his two sons Korinthos and Sikyon, who gave their names to the territories that they came
to rule. When Korinthos subsequently died without a male heir, the Corinthians invited
Medeia, the daughter of Aietes, to become their queen, and she ruled there for a time in
conjunction with her husband Jason. As she gave birth to each of her children, she hid them
away in the sanctuary of Hera in the hope of making them immortal, but they died in every
case, and Jason was so appalled when he ﬁnally learned of this that he sailed away to Iolkos.
After being abandoned by her husband, Medeia decided to leave also, and transferred the
kingdom to Sisyphos (who was thus the ﬁrst ruler in a new Aiolid line in this account rather
than the city’s founder).192
In the account familiar from Euripides, Jason and Medeia lived at Corinth as guests of
the city’s ruler, Kreon (see p. 398), whose commonplace name (which simply means ‘Ruler’)
would suggest that he was ﬁrst invented for the sake of this story. He could doubtless have
been inserted into the Sisyphid line at some point; according to the Euripidean scholia, he
was the son of a certain Lykaithos who ascended to the throne after the departure of
Bellerophon (presumably as a member of the same family, although this is not stated).193
The Corinthians liked to believe that Korinthos, the eponym of their city, had been a
son of Zeus, but this was apparently regarded as something of a joke by the other Greeks,
and the very expression ‘Korinthos, son of Zeus’ became a proverbial phrase for a piece of
tiresome nonsense.194 The name of the city was prehellenic (as in the case of other names
such as Hyakinthos that have the same sufﬁx).
Sisyphos married Merope, daughter of Atlas, who bore him a son and heir,
GLAUKOS,195 and perhaps other children too. Glaukos was famous for the remark-
able manner of his death, for it was said that he was torn apart by his own
chariot-horses. He had fed them on human ﬂesh in the hope of making them
dangerous in battle, but he was obliged to feed them on dull vegetarian food while
attending the funeral games for Pelias, and they satisﬁed their craving for red meat
by devouring Glaukos himself.196 Or in other accounts, Aphrodite sent them mad
to punish Glaukos for scorning her rites, or because she was angry with him because
he had prevented his horses from mating in the hope of making them swifter;197
or the animals were driven into a homicidal frenzy after eating a special grass at
Potniai in Boeotia that had a maddening effect on horses198 (or because they had
drunk water from a well there that had the same effect199). After suffering this
terrible death, Glaukos became a malicious ghost, the TARAXIPPOS or ‘Horse-
scarer’, who was supposed to cause panic among the chariot-horses during races at
the Isthmian Games (which were held near Corinth).200
There was less agreement about the origin of the more famous Taraxippos who haunted the
race-course at Olympia. Some stories traced its origin to the chariot-races in which the local
— The history of the Deukalionids —
432

hero Oinomaos used to compete with his daughter’s suitors (see p. 503); perhaps it was the
angry ghost of Myrtilos, who had been killed by Pelops after helping him to victory in the
race, or Oinomaos himself, who had been killed during his race with Pelops, or one of the
suitors who had been killed by Oinomaos during previous races.201 If a race-course was trou-
bled by a Taraxippos, it would be wise for the charioteers to appease him with prayers and
sacriﬁces before setting out on their races.
The adventures of Bellerophon in Argos and Lycia
Glaukos married Eurymede or Eurynome, daughter of Nisos, who bore him a son
of far greater stature than himself, the monster-slaying hero BELLEROPHON (or
Bellerophontes).202 There was also a tradition that suggested that Poseidon was the
true father of Bellerophon, as is stated in the Hesiodic Catalogue and indicated 
by Pindar.203
According to the relevant fragment from the Catalogue, Sisyphos initially chose Mestra, the
shape-shifting daughter of Erysichthon, as a wife for Glaukos, paying valuable bride-gifts for
her, but she soon ﬂed back to her father’s house. Since there are large gaps in the papyrus, we
cannot tell whether she made use of her special powers to do so (as when she ﬂed from her
masters to gain money for her father, see p. 133). Although Sisyphos was understandably
aggrieved, Zeus had other plans for her, having no wish that she should bear an ordinary
human family; and she was carried off by Poseidon to the island of Cos, where she bore him
two sons. So Sisyphos was obliged to choose another bride for his son, a ‘daughter of Pan-
dionides’ (presumably his usual wife as named above, who was a granddaughter of Pandion,
king of Athens). Even if the marriage endured on this occasion, it was Zeus’s will that Glaukos
should father no children even by this wife, and his putative son Bellerophon was fathered by
Poseidon instead.204
While still a young man, Bellerophon had to leave Corinth forever as the result of
an accidental killing. His victim is variously named, some suggesting, for instance,
that he killed a certain Belleros (since his name could be interpreted as meaning
‘Belleros-slayer’) or else a brother of variable name.205 Bellerophon sought refuge in
the Argolid with Proitos, king of Tiryns, who puriﬁed him and welcomed him to
his court; but trouble arose when the king’s wife, who is generally named as
Stheneboia (but is called Anteia in the Iliad) conceived a passion for the handsome
stranger and pressed him to meet her in secret. For when she found herself rejected,
her desire turned to fury and she told her husband that Bellerophon had tried to
rape or seduce her. Although Proitos fully believed her, he was reluctant to take
direct action against a guest whom he had puriﬁed, and sent him off to his father-
in-law Iobates, the king of Lycia in Asia Minor, with a sealed tablet or letter asking
that he should be put of death.
As Homer tells the story, the king of Lycia (here unnamed) entertained him on
his arrival for nine days, slaughtering nine cows, and questioned him at dawn on
the tenth day, asking to see the message that he had brought. After learning of
Proitos’ wish, he ordered Bellerophon to kill the CHIMAIRA, a ﬁre-breathing
monster which was thought to be unconquerable. Homer describes it as being like
a lion in front, a dragon behind, and a goat (chimaira, hence its name) in the middle;
in subsequent depictions, it resembles a lion in its basic form, but has a snake in

place of a tail, and a goat’s head projecting from the middle of its back. Bellerophon
proceeded to kill it, trusting in signs from the gods. The king then contrived two
further ordeals for him, by sending him out against the Solymoi, a bellicose people
of the area, and the Amazons, female warriors who were a match for any man; but
he returned safe in each case after slaughtering the enemy, and the king subjected
him to a ﬁnal ordeal by picking out a chosen band of warriors from throughout his
land. When Bellerophon killed them without exception, the king realized that he
must be the intrepid offspring of some god and offered him his daughter Philonoe
(or Antikleia) in marriage along with a share of the kingdom.206 Bellerophon fathered
three children by his Lycian wife, namely a daughter Laodameia, who bore Sarpedon
to Zeus, and two sons, Hippolochos, who became the father of Glaukos (Sarpedon’s
second in command at Troy), and Isandros, who met an early death; for further
consideration of this family, see pp. 349–50. Things turned out badly for
Bellerophon in the end, so Homer tells us, for he came to be hated by all the gods
for some unspeciﬁed reason, ‘and he went wandering alone over the Aleian plain
[i.e. Plain of Wandering], eating his heart out, shunning the paths of men’.207
In all subsequent accounts, Bellerophon is said to have ridden out against the
Chimaira on the back of the winged horse Pegasos, which was a son of Poseidon by
the Gorgon Medusa (see p. 60 for the circumstances of his birth). According to 
Pindar, he had initially found Pegasos hard to tame and had consulted the seer
Polyeidos (see p. 430), who told him to sleep overnight in the shrine of Athena in
Corinth. The goddess appeared to him in his sleep and told him to accept a bridle
from her for use on Pegasos, and to sacriﬁce a white bull to his father Poseidon, as
tamer of horses. He woke up to ﬁnd a wonderful golden-banded bridle lying beside
him, and employed it to good effect (see also p. 183).208 Or in another version, Athena
tamed Pegasos on the hero’s behalf by placing a bit in his mouth;209 or else
Bellerophon captured him as he was drinking at the spring of Peirene at Corinth, or
received him as a gift from his father Poseidon.210 However he came to possess him,
he made good use of him to defeat his enemies by riding out against them from above.
According to a tale from a lost play by Euripides, the Stheneboia, Bellerophon
returned to Tiryns after surviving his ordeals and wreaked revenge on Stheneboia
with the help of his ﬂying horse; for he persuaded her to ride up into the sky with
him, and pushed her off while they were high over the Aegean near Melos.211 His
sad predicament at the end of his life, as described in the Iliad, is explained in some
late sources as a fate that he had incurred by attempting to ﬂy up to Olympos on
the back of Pegasos. For Zeus had been so angered by his presumption that he had
sent a gadﬂy against the horse, causing Bellerophon to be thrown to the ground 
in Lycia, where he wandered around in misery ever afterwards.212 Or in another
version, he became giddy with fear on looking downwards and fell to his death.213
As for Pegasos, he continued on his way, and Zeus granted him an honoured posi-
tion in the heavens as the constellation of the Horse (now known correspondingly
as Pegasus).214
Since Bellerophon was never able to return to Corinth, the throne passed out of
Glaukos’ line to a certain Thoas, who is said to have been a grandson of Sisyphos
through a son of his called Ornytion or Ornytios; and the city was then ruled by
Thoas and his descendants for three generations until one of the Heraklids, Aletes,
— The history of the Deukalionids —
434

conquered it with a Dorian army (see p. 290).215 Ornytion had a further son, Phokos,
who settled at Phocis in Central Greece (see p. 565).
Two lesser Aiolids, Deion and Magnes, and their families
DEION (or Deioneus), who has no myths of his own, ruled the province of Phocis
in Central Greece. He married Diomede, daughter of Xouthos, who bore him a
number of children including Kephalos, whose stormy marriage with Prokris in
Attica was considered in Chapter 10 (see pp. 371ff), and PHYLAKOS, the epony-
mous founder of Phylake in southern Thessaly.216 Lying to the south-west of Iolkos
and Pherai, Phylake ranked with Achilles’ home-town of Phthia in mythical history
as one of the two main cities of Phthiotis, the south-eastern region of Thessaly.
Phylakos married Klymene, daughter of Minyas, who bore him two children, a son
IPHIKLOS and a daughter Alkimede, who married Aison to become the mother of
Jason.217 As was recounted earlier in the chapter, Phylakos imprisoned the seer
Melampous for trying to steal his cattle, but later released him to enable him to
ﬁnd a cure for the impotence that he had unwittingly induced in his son Iphiklos
(see further on p. 427). Iphiklos was duly cured and married a certain Astyoche who
bore him two sons of note, PROTESILAOS, who was the ﬁrst of the Greeks to leap
ashore at Troy and the ﬁrst to be killed (see further on p. 450), and PODARKES,
who commanded the men of Phylake and neighbouring cities in the Trojan War
after the death of his brother.218 In late epic, Podarkes was said to have fallen to
the Amazon Penthesileia in the last stages of the war;219 he was named Podarkes
or ‘Swift-foot’ in commemoration of his father’s most remarkable capacity, his prodi-
gious swiftness of foot. For it was said that Iphiklos could outpace the wind, and
that he could run so swiftly over standing corn that the ears had no time to bend
or break, or so swiftly over the sea that he never sank beneath the surface.220 This
is mentioned in a fragment from the Hesiodic Catalogue, and was certainly a very
ancient feature of the tradition since Homer refers to Iphiklos as a particularly fast
runner and knows that his son was called ‘Swift-foot’.221 Some claimed that he won
the foot-race at the funeral games for Pelias.222
Deion also had two daughters, Asterodeia and Philonis, who remained in their native land of
Phocis. Asterodeia married Phokos, son of Aiakos,223 who was one of the two eponyms of the
land along with Phokos, son of Ornytion; for the part that these two eponyms were supposed
to have played in the history of Phocis, and for the twin sons who were born to the former by
Asterodeia, see p. 565. Philonis also produced two sons in one birth, but in very different
circumstances. She was so beautiful that she attracted the desire of two gods at once, Apollo
and Hermes, who both slept with her on the same day; and she conceived the mythical musi-
cian Philammon to Apollo, and the master-thief Autolykos (see p. 431) to Hermes.224 Both
of her sons spent their lives on Parnassos, the mountain that dominated their grandfather’s
realm. Philammon fathered Thamyris, an even greater musician than himself, on a Parnassian
nymph called Argiope. She gave birth to her child in Thrace (where he would later engage in
his celebrated contest with the Muses, see p. 206) because Philammon refused to take her into
his home.225 If this story shows him in a rather bad light, he met a noble death while trying
to prevent the Phlegyans from plundering Delphi (see p. 560).226 Pherecydes is exceptional
in suggesting that he rather than Orpheus was the singer who accompanied the Argonauts.227

In Apollodorus’ account, the remaining son of Aiolos was MAGNES, the eponym
of Magnesia, the coastal district of northern Thessaly; he married a naiad nymph
and fathered two sons, Polydektes and Diktys, who settled on the island of Seriphos
and played an important role in story of Perseus (see pp. 239ff).228 In the Hesiodic
Catalogue, however, Magnes was of different birth as a son of Zeus by Thuia daughter
of Deukalion, and was the brother of Makedon, the eponym of Macedonia.229
Although the name of the seventh son of Aiolos has not been preserved in the
surviving fragments of the Catalogue, it has been plausibly suggested that he may
have been Minyas (the eponym of the Minyans, see p. 558).

THE TROJAN 
WAR

THE ORIGIN OF THE WAR AND THE 
GREEK CROSSING
Zeus lays plans for a great war
T
he culminating event of the mythical history of Greece was the great war in
which Agamemnon, king of Mycenae, and Menelaos, king of Sparta, led a great
army against Troy, a rich and powerful city in the north-western corner of Asia
Minor, and ﬁnally conquered it after besieging it for ten years. The conﬂict was
provoked by the abduction of Helen, the wife of Menelaos, who was carried off to
Asia by Paris, the son of Priam, king of Troy; and this episode was itself an element
in a divine plan that had been devised to rid the earth of an excess of human beings.
For Gaia (Earth) had complained to Zeus that she was overburdened by all the mortals
who were swarming over her surface and were not only far too numerous but impious
besides; and after relieving the problem to some extent by inciting the Theban Wars,
Zeus had planned to cause even greater carnage by means of thunderbolts and ﬂoods.
But Momos, the personiﬁcation of fault-ﬁnding (see p. 26), criticized his plans and
proposed a subtler course of action, suggesting that a destructive war should be
provoked between Europe and Asia by indirect means. As the ﬁrst two steps towards
this end, she said that the goddess Thetis should be married to a mortal and that Zeus
should father a daughter of surpassing beauty. So Zeus fathered Helen, and Thetis
was married to Peleus at a magniﬁcent wedding that was attended by the gods (see
p. 54). During the wedding-feast, Eris, the personiﬁcation of Strife (see p. 30),
provoked a furious quarrel between Hera, Athena and Aphrodite by hurling an apple
in front of them marked with the inscription ‘to the most beautiful’; and Zeus then
instructed the divine messenger Hermes to escort the three goddesses to Mt Ida in
the land of Troy to be judged for their beauty by Paris. When Aphrodite persuaded
Paris to award her the victory by promising that she would help him to marry Helen,
a daughter of Zeus who was the most beautiful woman in the world, the projected
conﬂict between Greece and Asia became inevitable; for the Trojan prince would have
to seize her from her legitimate husband in Greece if he were to make her his wife.
This would be a hazardous action because her husband Menelaos was not only a man

CHAPTER THIRTEEN

of some eminence as king of Sparta, but was also the brother of Agamemnon, the
most powerful ruler in Greece; and most importantly of all, the many suitors of Helen
had bound themselves by oath to come to the aid of her chosen husband if she should
ever be taken from him (see p. 440). It was therefore by no means difﬁcult for
Menelaos to raise a large force of allies to sail against Troy to recover his wife, so
bringing the divine plan to its fulﬁlment. Such is the earliest surviving account 
of the origin of the war, as was presented in the Cypria, the ﬁrst epic in the Trojan
cycle.1 It was also suggested that Zeus contrived the abduction of Helen to ensure
that his daughter would be famous ever afterwards for having been the cause of the
mightiest war in history; or else he provoked the war simply to bring everlasting
glory to the men of the heroic age.2
The birth and early life of Helen, and her marriage 
to Menelaos
HELEN of Sparta and Troy was no ordinary woman but a daughter of Zeus whose
beauty was tinged with more than a trace of the divine. Her putative father was
Tyndareos, the last Atlantid king of Sparta, whose wife LEDA bore various children
either to him or to Zeus.3 Tyndareos’ branch of the Atlantid family, which formed
the original ruling line in Sparta, will be examined in full in a later chapter (see 
pp. 524ff); for the present it will be sufﬁcient to note that Leda bore three daughters
to her husband, including Klytaimnestra, who became the wife of Agamemnon and
was also the mother of Kastor and Polydeukes, the Dioskouroi, who were fathered
either by Zeus or Tyndareos (or one by each) according to differing accounts.
Although the Dioskouroi were great heroes, by far the greatest in the early Spartan
line, they were able neither to ﬁght at Troy nor to succeed to the Spartan throne
because they met a premature death shortly before the Trojan War (see pp. 526ff for 
the circumstances). As a consequence, Tyndareos adopted his son-in-law Menelaos,
the husband of Helen, as his successor. It was universally agreed that Helen was not
in fact a true daughter of Tyndareos, but a child of Zeus; but strangely enough, there
was disagreement about the identity of her mother (even if it was always accepted
that she was reared by Leda at Sparta).
In the earliest recorded tradition, Zeus fathered Helen by the minor goddess
NEMESIS (the personiﬁcation of Retribution, see p. 26), and Leda was no more
than her foster-mother. The circumstances of her conception were described in the
Cypria, which told how Nemesis ﬂed by land and water in the hope of escaping the
embraces of Zeus, now turning into a ﬁsh to speed through the seas and encircling
Ocean, and now assuming the forms of all manner of dreadful beasts as she was
ﬂeeing overland; but when she ﬁnally turned into a goose, Zeus assumed the same
form and mated with her, causing her to conceive Helen, who was born from an
egg.4 The goose-mating was said to have occurred at Rhamnous, a coastal town in
the north-eastern corner of Attica which contained a sanctuary of Nemesis.5 In some
later accounts, Zeus or both partners mated in swan-form.6 The Cypria would
presumably have reported that the resulting egg was transferred to Leda in some
way after it was laid by Nemesis; later sources state either that it was brought to
— The Trojan War —
438

Leda by a shepherd who discovered it in a grove in Attica, or that it was dropped
into her lap by Hermes (doubtless at the order of Zeus).7
The competing tradition that made Helen a true daughter of Leda was as old if
not older, for Helen states in the Iliad that she and the Dioskouroi shared the same
mother (evidently Leda, who is always the mother of the Dioskouroi and is named
as such in the Odyssey).8 Euripides’ Helen, a play ﬁrst produced in 412 BC, and works
of art from the latter part of the ﬁfth century provide the earliest evidence for the
familiar account of Helen’s origin in which Zeus fathered her by mating with Leda
in the form of a swan. Leda herself was in her ordinary human form; although the
idea of the god’s transformation was evidently inspired by the legend of his bird-
mating with Nemesis, there could be no question of Leda, as a mere mortal,
transforming herself as Nemesis was supposed to have done. According to Euripides,
Zeus assumed the form of a swan in order to put a seduction-ruse into action; for
he caused an eagle to chase him through the air while he was in that form, and
then sought shelter in Leda’s lap9 (much as in the myth in which he was said to
have seduced Hera by settling in her lap as a storm-tossed cuckoo, see p. 137). Leda
laid an egg as a result of this encounter, just as Nemesis was supposed to have done;
it could be seen in later times in the temple of the Leukippides in Sparta, hanging
from the roof on ribbons.10 Some claimed that the Dioskouroi were born from the
same egg or a similar one.11
Helen’s childhood was brutally interrupted when she was abducted by Theseus
and Peirithoos while she was still below marriageable age, perhaps as young as eight
or ten; but Theseus was unable to hide her away until he could marry her, as he
had intended, because the Dioskouroi discovered her hiding-place and recovered her
while he was absent on another adventure (see further on p. 361). While doing so,
they captured Aithra, the mother of Theseus, who had been looking after Helen on
her son’s behalf; and she was obliged to serve Helen thereafter as an attendant, ﬁrst
at Sparta and later at Troy. Since Aithra is mentioned in this role in the Iliad, the
story of this ﬁrst abduction of Helen must have been familiar by Homer’s time,
even if the poet makes no explicit mention of it.12
When Helen reached maturity, she was courted with due formality by most of
the principal rulers and heroes of Greece, including MENELAOS, son of Atreus,
who had no kingdom of his own as yet but had long enjoyed the favour of Tyndareos
(see p. 508). He could also count on the support of his brother Agamemnon, the
rich and powerful king of Mycenae. It should be remembered that Agamemnon
himself and the great hero Achilles, who might otherwise have been formidable
contenders, were not in a position to compete for Helen’s hand because the former
was already married to Klytaimnestra, the half-sister of Helen, and the latter was
too young. According to the early account in the Hesiodic Catalogue, in so far as it
is known from quite extensive fragments, the suitors conducted their courtship 
at a distance (initially at any rate) by sending heralds to Sparta with all kinds of
valuable gifts. The Dioskouroi seem to have played a central role both in dealing
with the envoys and in determining the outcome. They ﬁnally chose in favour of
Menelaos, even though they had been planning to award Helen to another suitor
(whose name is not preserved) until Agamemnon intervened on his brother’s behalf.

Since Agamemnon was not only rich enough to offer precious gifts but also a son-
in-law of Tyndareos, it is understandable that his intervention should have proved
decisive. The poet explicitly states that Menelaos was chosen because he offered the
greatest gifts (evidently with the help of his brother). We are told that Odysseus
knew in his heart that Menelaos was bound to win because he was the richest in
possessions and was forever sending messages to the Dioskouroi.13 In the standard
later tradition, the suitors gathered at Sparta and the decision was made by
Tyndareos;14 or in another version, he allowed Helen herself to choose in accord-
ance with her heart’s desire.15
According to a tradition that was already known to Stesichorus and the author of
the Hesiodic Catalogue, Tyndareos feared that the rejected suitors might cause trouble
when he revealed his choice, and he therefore demanded that they should all swear
beforehand that they would come to the aid of the chosen suitor if he should be
threatened with violence or robbed of his wife. In one account, this measure was
suggested to him by the cunning Odysseus, who was aware of Tyndareos’ worries 
and offered to provide a solution if the king would do him a favour in return, by
helping him to win Penelope as his wife; for Tyndareos was in a position to assist him
in this matter since Penelope was a daughter of his brother Ikarios (see p. 525).16
According to local tradition, the oaths were taken at a place known as the Horse’s
Grave (Hippou Mne¯me¯), which lay by the river Eurotas not far to the north of Sparta;
for it was said that Tyndareos sacriﬁced a horse there, told the suitors to stand on
pieces of its ﬂesh as they swore their oaths, and then buried its remains at the spot.17
These oaths would be of greater signiﬁcance than Tyndareos could ever have imag-
ined, since they would oblige many of the foremost heroes of Greece to ﬁght on behalf
of Menelaos at Troy after Helen was abducted by Paris.
As the story of the oath would imply, most of the Greek leaders at Troy were reckoned to
have been suitors of Helen. Apollodorus and Hyginus provide catalogues of the suitors,18
evidently based for the most part on the muster-list in the second book of the Iliad. The
following suitors are named in the surviving fragments of the Hesiodic Catalogue: Menelaos,
the Telamonian Aias, the two sons of Amphiaraos (i.e. Alkmaion and Amphilochos),
Elephenor of Euboea, Idomoneus of Crete, Patroklos and Iphiklos from Thessaly, Thoas from
Aetolia, and Odysseus. All of these are listed as Greek leaders in the Iliad except for the 
sons of Amphiaraos (one of whom, Alkmaion, died before the outbreak of the war). Since
Apollodorus excludes Patroklos and Idomoneus from his list, it is unlikely that he based it on
the Catalogue. The author of that poem tried as best he could to relate the manners of courtship
of the individual suitors to their known characters and circumstances. Aias, for instance, who
possessed little of his own but was brave with his spear, promised to provide suitable bride-
gifts and wondrous deeds too by robbing sheep and cattle from his neighbours.19 Odysseus,
on the other hand, had such a shrewd idea of his prospects that he spared himself the expense
of sending any presents at all.20
After her marriage to Menelaos, Helen lived a luxurious and uneventful life at the
Spartan court for some years, bearing a single child, Hermione, to her husband, who
succeeded Tyndareos as king at some stage. Hermione is described in the Odyssey as
‘having the beauty of golden Aphrodite’; she is said to have been nine years old
when Paris arrived to disturb the tranquillity of the court.21
— The Trojan War —
440

Although Hermione is the only child of Helen and Menelaos in the Homeric epics, the couple
are sometimes credited with a son too, Nikostratos (Victorious Army), whose name would
suggest that he was born after the Trojan War. Or else Nikostratos was an illegitimate son of
Menelaos by a slave girl, as in the case of Megapenthes, who was fathered by the king shortly
after the abduction of Helen, hence his name (Great Sorrow).22 Megapenthes is mentioned
along with Hermione in the Odyssey; for when Telemachos visits the Spartan court after the
Trojan War, he ﬁnds that the marriages of both are being celebrated there, since Menelaos is
sending Hermione to Neoptolemos (see p. 490) and bringing a Spartan maiden to his own
home as a bride for Megapenthes.23 Since it was commonly agreed that Menelaos bequeathed
his throne to his nephew Orestes (see p. 514), it seems to have been assumed that he had no
male descendant to succeed him at the time of his death. A Rhodian tale claimed nonetheless
that Megapenthes and Nikostratos banded together after his death to drive Helen into exile,
causing her to sail away to Rhodes, where she hoped to take refuge with Polyxo, the queen of
the island, who was of Argive birth. As misfortune would have it, Polyxo blamed Helen for
the death of her husband Tlepolemos at Troy (see p. 293), and exacted her revenge by inciting
some of her maids to dress like Furies and hang Helen from a tree. This legend explained the
origin of the Rhodian cult of Helene Dendritis (of the tree).24
The birth and early life of Paris, and his judgement of 
the three goddesses
Troy was ruled at this period by PRIAM (properly Priamos), son of Laomedon, who
was now quite old and lived in his splendid palace in Ilion (the city of Troy) with
his family all around him. The Iliad credits him with ﬁfty sons, nineteen of whom
were borne to him by his wife HEKABE (or Hecuba in Latin form), and with many
female children too, including twelve married daughters who lived with him in the
palace; his sons slept with their wives in ﬁfty adjoining chambers of polished stone,
while the above-mentioned daughters slept with their husbands in twelve chambers
on the opposite side of the courtyard.25 As these arrangements would suggest, the
royal family dominated the life of the city and the ﬁghting in wartime in a manner
that was foreign to the Greeks. Priam’s family will be examined further below 
(pp. 451ff) along with the main noble families; for the time being, we will concen-
trate on PARIS, who was marked out for a special destiny that would set him apart
from his many brothers.
Just before Paris was due to be born, his mother Hekabe was disturbed by a
sinister dream in which she saw herself giving birth to a ﬂaming torch that burned
down the city (and perhaps the forests of Mt Ida too); or in the earliest surviving
account by Pindar, she imagined that she gave birth to a ﬁre-breathing hundred-
handed Erinys (Fury) that hurled the entire city to the ground. After consulting
with the diviners, who could hardly have found it difﬁcult to interpret this partic-
ular dream, Priam ordered that his forthcoming child should be exposed at birth
to ensure that he could never bring any harm to the city; but although the new-
born Paris was duly abandoned on Mt Ida, he was rescued by a shepherd (or
shepherds) and reared in the hills in rural isolation.26 According to a tradition ﬁrst
reported by the Hellenistic poet Lycophron, the exposed infant was suckled by a
she-bear for several days until he was recovered by the shepherd.27

In another account of the events surrounding the birth of Paris, Priam consulted a local
oracle about his kingdom shortly after Paris was born, and was ordered to kill the woman
who had just given birth along with her child. Now it happened that Killa, a sister of
Hekabe, who was married to a Trojan elder called Thymoites, had given birth to a child at
the very same time as the result of a secret liaison with Priam; and Priam killed Killa and
her son Mounippos rather than Hekabe and Paris. Or in a rather different version, Priam
received corresponding advice from Aisakos (a son of his who was gifted with prophetic
powers, see p. 453), and Mounippos was a legitimate son of Thymoites.28
The abandoned child was named Paris by his rescuer and grew up to become a
sturdy young man. Ancient authors often refer to him by an alternative name of
Alexandros (Alexander), effectively meaning warrior; some claimed that this title
was conferred on him during his early years in the country because he was so brave
in ‘repelling’ robbers and ‘defending’ the livestock (in accordance with meanings of
the Greek verb alexo¯).29 One day, after he had come of age, a favourite bull of his
was seized by some servants of Priam; for the king – who naturally supposed that
his exposed son was dead – had decided to hold some games in memory of his long-
lost son, and had sent some men out into the country to fetch a suitable prize. On
seeing them leading his bull away, Paris ran after them to demand an explanation,

and was told about the games. So he went to Troy to win his bull back again and
was victorious in every event, defeating every rival including his own brothers. One
of the princes, Deiphobos, was so angry at being defeated by an apparent commoner
that he drew his sword against him, causing him to take refuge at the altar of Zeus
Herkeios; but his true identity was soon revealed by his prophetic sister Kassandra,
and Priam then acknowledged him as his son and invited him to assume his rightful
position as a member of the royal family.30
Even if Paris was now welcomed back into the family as though his mother’s ill-
omened dream were no longer of signiﬁcance, the divine plan that would cause him
to bring disaster to Troy (see p. 437) was still underway; and it was set in full
course when Hermes brought Hera, Athena and Aphrodite to him on Mt Ida to be
judged for their beauty. This contest is known to have been described in the intro-
ductory section of the Cypria, although the surviving summary offers little detail,
merely reporting that Paris judged in favour of Aphrodite because she won him
over by promising Helen to him as a wife; we are not told whether the other two
goddesses also offered inducements. A fragment from the poem describes how
Aphrodite prepared herself for the contest, by clothing herself in perfumed garments
dyed with ﬂowers of the spring which had been made for her by the Charites and
Horai (Graces and Seasons), and by weaving sweet-smelling garlands of ﬂowers with
the help of her attendants. As the legend is usually recounted in tragedy and later
sources, quite possibly on the basis of epic accounts, each of the goddesses offered
a bribe to Paris, Hera promising him royal sway, Athena success in war, and
Aphrodite the loveliest of women as a wife. If it is kept in mind that the goddesses
are (so to speak) incorporated in their own gifts, Hera representing royalty, Athena
conquest and Aphrodite delight of love, this may surely be recognized as a literary
handling of that old problem, so familiar in folklore, ‘Which good thing is the
best?’, all the more so when it is remembered that the goods thus offered held a
very high place in the popular Greek table of values. By his response to the goddesses’
inducements, Paris makes a choice between different forms of life and exposes himself
to judgement by the choice that he makes. By deciding in favour of Aphrodite, he
earned the undying hatred of the other goddesses; and by then proceeding to abduct
Helen from Sparta with her help, he would incur the vengeance of Menelaos and
the Greeks in general. As we have seen, Menelaos could call on the support of all
the former suitors of Helen in these circumstances, and the Trojan War would there-
fore be set in train, and the plan of Zeus fulﬁlled.31
There is only a single direct reference to the judgement of Paris in the Iliad, even if a number
of passages relating to Hera, Athena and Aphrodite can be best interpreted in the light of that
legend. After making it clear throughout the poem that Hera and Athena were exceptionally
hostile to Troy, Homer offers an explanation for their attitude in the ﬁnal book. The question
arises in connection with Achilles’ mistreatment of Hektor’s corpse (see p. 465). The gods
ﬁnally became so disgusted by the Greek hero’s behaviour that they wanted to send Hermes
to steal Hektor’s body away from him, a plan that was approved by all of them apart from
Hera, Poseidon and Athena, who persisted in the hatred that they had long felt for sacred Ilion
and for Priam and his people ‘because of the blind folly (ate¯) of Alexandros (Paris), who had
scorned the goddesses (i.e. Hera and Athena) when they had come to his steading, and gave
his preference to the one who offered him grievous lust’ ($

obviously Aphrodite).32 This may be expressed in a rather obscure manner, but there is no
reason to suppose that it refers to anything other than the familiar tale of the judgement of
Paris, especially when it is remembered that Hera and Athena support the Greeks throughout
the Iliad while Aphrodite supports the Trojans and maintains a special association with Paris
and Helen.
Paris sails to Greece to abduct Helen
Paris now prepared to sail off to Greece to win Helen as his wife. On the advice of
Aphrodite, he arranged for some ships to be built for him by Phereklos son of
Tekton (whose subsequent death at the hand of the Cretan hero Meriones is described
in the Iliad).33 He received ample warning about the consequences of the enterprise
before he set sail for Troy. According to the Cypria, two notable seers from his own
family, his brother Helenos and his sister Kassandra, foretold what would happen
if he went ahead;34 and a tradition that ﬁrst appears in the ﬁfth century BC suggests
that he received similar warnings from his own wife; for he was already married to
a prophetic nymph called Oinone, who told him that he would bring disaster on
himself and his city too.35 He set out to sea nevertheless together with Aineias, who
accompanied him at the order of Aphrodite.
The predicament of OINONE was particularly sad because she knew from the beginning
that the love of Paris would bring her nothing but unhappiness. He met her while he was
still living out on Mt Ida with the shepherds; she was a daughter of Kebren, the god of a
local river. When Paris assured her of his love and swore that he would never abandon her,
she was able to tell him through her own prophetic arts (which she had acquired from the
gods or from Rhea speciﬁcally) that even if he loved her immeasurably at the moment, the
time would come when he would desert her to abduct a woman from Europe. As he was
about to set off, she told him that he would suffer a grave wound in the conﬂict that would
be provoked by his forthcoming action, and that she alone would be able to cure him; or
she simply told him to come to her if he should suffer a wound. When he was indeed
afﬂicted by a serious arrow-wound in the last stages of the war (see p. 471), he called Oinone’s
words to mind and sent a messenger to Mt Ida to summon her help; but she was now so
embittered that she refused to come, saying that Paris should turn to Helen instead. On
seeing his dead body afterwards, however, she was overcome by remorse and killed herself.
Or in a slightly different version, she thought again after ﬁrst refusing to help him and
arrived with healing drugs, only to ﬁnd that he had died in the mean time.36
According to Hellanicus, Oinone and Paris had a son called KORYTHOS, who went to
Troy to take part in the ﬁghting and fell in love with Helen; she treated him kindly enough
because he was exceptionally handsome, until Paris came to hear of his visits and killed him.
Or in another account, Oinone sent him to Helen to stir up trouble, hoping that Helen
would ﬁnd him attractive and Paris would feel jealous as a consequence. The plan worked
all too well, though not in a way that she would have wished, for Paris suspected the worst
when he saw the two of them sitting together in Helen’s bedroom one day, and killed
Korythos in the heat of the moment. This gave Oinone an added reason for refusing to heal
Paris when he was subsequently wounded.37
When Paris arrived in Laconia, he was entertained initially by the Dioskouroi, and
then travelled on to Sparta, where he received generous hospitality from Menelaos
— The Trojan War —
444

and Helen. After nine days, however, Menelaos had to sail away to Crete to attend
the funeral of Katreus, the former king of the island (who was his maternal grand-
father, see p. 355); so he entrusted his guests to the care of Helen, telling her to
provide them with whatever they asked. Paris took advantage of his absence to pay
court to Helen, an endeavour that proved none too difﬁcult in view of his own phys-
ical attractions and the aid that he received from Aphrodite. As soon as she was
willing to consent, he eloped with her by night, loading much of her husband’s
treasure on to his ship before they sailed.38 They consummated their union before
leaving in the Cypria, while the Iliad states that they did so after their departure
on an island of uncertain location called Kranae39 (Rocky Island, later identiﬁed
with the isle of Helene off the southern tip of Attica, or with Cythera, or a small
island off the Laconian coast near Gythion40). Presumably in her function as the
protector of marriage, Hera sent storm-winds against the eloping couple, causing
them to be carried to Sidon in Phoenicia. The Iliad alludes to their visit, mentioning
that Paris bought some ﬁnely embroidered robes there, and it would appear that he
even conquered the city in the Cypria. After a brief delay (or after waiting in the
area for some time to avoid pursuit), Paris and Helen completed their voyage and
arrived at Troy, where they formalized their union with due ceremony.41
Stesichorus, a poet of the sixth century BC, recounted two versions of Helen’s story, ﬁrst
offering the usual version in which she helped to provoke the Trojan War by eloping with
Paris, and then writing a Palinode, or poem of recantation, in which he provided a wholly
different tale, apparently of his own invention, to vindicate Helen’s honour. Legend claimed
that she had struck him blind for insulting her in the ﬁrst poem, and he had then composed
the recantation in order to regain his sight (see further on p. 583). According to the Palinode
(of which very little has survived), Helen neither embarked with Paris on his ship nor arrived
at Troy, but apparently remained in Sparta for the duration of the war while a phantom
(eido¯lon) of her accompanied Paris to Troy.42 A similar story is recounted in a surviving 
play by Euripides, the Helen, in which Hera is said to have created the phantom in her anger
at having been passed over in the judgement of Paris. This phantom was abducted to Troy
by Paris, while the true Helen was conveyed to Egypt by Hermes, and lived there at the
royal court until the end of the war; when Menelaos was shipwrecked in Egypt while sailing
home with the phantom Helen after the war, the phantom disappeared and the true Helen
took her place. According to Euripides, Helen was in danger of being held back in Egypt
because the original ruler, Proteus, had died during the time of the war and had been
succeeded by his vicious son Theoklymenos, who wanted to force Helen to marry him, and
killed every Greek who ventured into his realm; but Helen managed to deceive him with
the help of his noble-minded sister, the priestess Theonoe. Euripides states similarly in the
Elektra that Zeus sent a phantom of Helen to Troy while the true Helen stayed in Egypt
with Proteus.43
Herodotus claimed to have heard from the priests of Egypt that Paris had been driven to
Egypt by a gale after sailing off with Helen, and that Proteus had taken Helen and the stolen
treasure away from him because he disapproved of his immoral behaviour. This is a rational-
istic version without the phantom Helen; for we are told that the Greeks made war on Troy
believing that Helen must be there, even though the Trojans assured them that she and the
treasure had been detained in Egypt; and when it was discovered after the fall of Troy that
there was indeed no sign of her in the city, the Greeks realized that the Trojans had been
telling the truth, and Menelaos sailed off to Egypt to recover Helen from Proteus.44

Menelaos and Agamemnon mount an expedition against Troy, 
but make a false start
Menelaos was informed of his wife’s abduction by the goddess Iris (who often acted
as a divine messenger, see pp. 56–7), and hurried back to Greece to consult with
his brother Agamemnon about raising an army to recover Helen from Troy.45 Since
all the former suitors of Helen were bound by oath to support her husband in such
circumstances (see p. 440), most of the leading rulers and heroes of Greece would
be obliged to ﬁght as his allies. In the Cypria, Menelaos (and possibly Agamemnon
too) travelled through Greece with Nestor to recruit chieftains for the expedition.
Or else Agamemnon simply sent heralds to advise the former suitors of their oblig-
ations.46 Of the many suitors, Odysseus alone attempted to avoid the summons (see
p. 459). Others agreed to take part of their own free will, most notably Achilles,
who had been a child at the time of Helen’s marriage, but was now invited to take
part because he was a young warrior of exceptional promise.
After the necessary arrangements had been made, the Greek chieftains and their
followers assembled at Aulis, a town on the east coast of Boeotia, to prepare for the
voyage across the Aegean to Troy. A comprehensive and very ancient catalogue of
the leaders, which also provides invaluable information about their places of origin
and relative power, can be found in the second book of the Iliad (lines 494–759);
some of the more prominent heroes will be discussed below (pp. 455ff). While at
Aulis, the Greeks witnessed a portent that was interpreted for them by the seer
Kalchas. A snake crept from beneath the altar during a sacriﬁce to Apollo and
climbed into a tree which held a nest containing eight sparrow-chicks; it devoured
the chicks, and also the mother-bird as she ﬂuttered around in response to their
cries, but was then turned to stone by Zeus. As Kalchas revealed, this meant that
the Greeks would spend nine years ﬁghting at Troy before the city ﬁnally fell to
them in the tenth year.47
When the Greeks ﬁrst set out for Troy, they were so ignorant of the geography of
the area that they landed in the neighbouring territory of Mysia and ravaged it in the
belief that it was Troy. On discovering that his kingdom was under attack, TELE-
PHOS, son of Herakles and Auge (see p. 543), the ruler of the Mysians, hastily assem-
bled an army and pursued the Greeks back to their ships, killing many of them,
including Thersandros, son of Polyneikes, the leader of the Boeotian contingent (see
p. 328). Achilles ﬁnally put him to ﬂight, however, and wounded him severely in the
thigh when he tripped over a vine-branch. Pindar mentions that Achilles stained the
vine-clad plain of Mysia with his blood; and some claimed that the accident was
provoked by Dionysos because Telephos had failed to pay him due honour.48
Having no quarrel with the Mysians, the Greeks re-embarked and sailed off in
search of Troy, but the ﬂeet was soon struck by a violent storm that scattered the
ships, and they made their way back to their separate homelands as best they could.
Since ten years would pass before they would make their second crossing, this false
start meant that Troy would not fall until twenty years after they had ﬁrst assem-
bled.49 This story of the delay was certainly of early origin since it was recounted
in the Cypria, and it may already have been known to Homer, for Helen remarks
in the Iliad at one point that it is twenty years since she left home.50

During the period between the two sailings, Telephos became increasingly trou-
bled by the state of his wound, which stubbornly refused to heal, and he eventually
decided to travel to Greece to consult the Delphic oracle. On being advised that
the inﬂictor of the wound should become its healer, he set off to ﬁnd Achilles, who
was now in Argos (for the Greek forces had gathered there before proceeding to
Aulis for the second sailing). In a famous scene from the lost Telephos of Euripides,
Telephos appeared among the Greeks dressed in rags like a beggar, and subsequently
seized Orestes, the infant son of Agamemnon, from his cot and threatened to kill
him if help were refused to him. Although Achilles protested that he knew nothing
of medicine, Odysseus explained that the oracle had not been referring to Achilles
himself when it had spoken of the ‘inﬂictor’ of the wound, but rather to the spear
that had actually inﬂicted the wound. This suggestion turned out to be correct, for
when Achilles scraped some rust from his Pelian spear into some water and applied
it to the wound, Telephos was immediately cured. The cure was achieved by a form
of sympathetic magic, as in the story of Iphiklos (see p. 427). Telephos repaid the
favour by guiding the Greeks across the Aegean when they set out for Troy.51
The Greeks make a successful crossing after the sacriﬁce 
of Iphigeneia
As the Greek force was preparing to sail from Aulis for a second time, the ﬂeet was
detained in port as the result of an act of impiety committed by Agamemnon.
According to the Cypria, he shot a stag while hunting in the area and was then
foolish enough to boast that he was a ﬁner hunter than Artemis herself. When the
goddess punished his presumption by sending adverse winds (or imposing a dead
calm) to prevent the ﬂeet from sailing, the seer Kalchas revealed that Agamemnon
was to blame, and declared that Artemis would not be appeased until one of his
unmarried daughters was offered in sacriﬁce to her. So his daughter IPHIGENEIA
was summoned from Mycenae on the pretence that she was to be married to Achilles,
and was then brought to sacriﬁce; but at the last moment, Artemis substituted a
stag for her on the altar, and transferred her to the land of the Taurians (the Crimea)
to become a goddess.52 Or in a version which ﬁrst appears in Euripides’ Iphigeneia
in Tauris, Artemis installed Iphigeneia as her mortal priestess in the land of the
Taurians (from where she was subsequently recovered by her brother Orestes); or in
the simplest version, as found in Pindar and Aeschylus, she was indeed killed at
the altar. Artemis abandoned her wrath in any case and withdrew the adverse winds
(or the windstill) to allow the Greek ﬂeet to proceed on its way.53
The mythology of Iphigeneia, which is of concern to us here only in relation to the sailing
of the ﬂeet, will be considered further in the next chapter in connection with the history of
her family (see pp. 512ff). Although the early epic account of the cause of Artemis’ anger
remained the standard one, there were other versions also. According to Euripides in the
Iphigeneia in Tauris, the goddess demanded the sacriﬁce as reparation for a broken vow. For
Agamemnon had made a vow many years before in which he had undertaken to offer her
the ﬁnest thing born in that year; but when his lovely daughter Iphigeneia had been born,
he had failed to sacriﬁce her in accordance with his vow.54 Or in a version recorded by

Apollodorus, the offence had dated back to the previous generation; for Agamemnon’s father
Atreus had vowed to Artemis that he would offer her the ﬁnest lamb born in his ﬂocks, but
had failed to sacriﬁce a golden-ﬂeeced lamb (see p. 506) when it had appeared.55 Or Artemis
was angered because Menelaos had shot a deer that was sacred to her.56
Agamemnon was certainly placed in a terrible predicament by Artemis’ demand; although
Aeschylus and Sophocles also wrote plays on this tempting subject, only Euripides’ Iphigeneia
in Aulis has survived. Achilles tries to save Iphigeneia in that play after discovering that she
has been summoned on the pretence of being married to him, but the situation is ﬁnally
resolved by the maiden herself, who agrees to be sacriﬁced for the common good.
After making a safe passage across the Aegean, the Greeks called in at the island
of Tenedos just off the coast of the Troad. Although the ruler of the island, TENES
(or Tennes), tried to keep them away by pelting them with stones, they landed
nonetheless, and Achilles killed Tenes with a sword-thrust to the breast.57 Or in a
version that is less creditable to the Greek hero, he killed Tenes when the king
intervened to stop him from raping his sister Hemithea.58
Tenes had become embittered and hostile to strangers as a result of his unfortunate
earlier history. He was a son of Kyknos, son of Poseidon (possibly to be identiﬁed

with the Kyknos mentioned below, p. 451), who ruled at Kolonai on the mainland
and had fathered Tenes by his ﬁrst wife, Prokleia, daughter of Laomedon. After the
death of Prokleia, Kyknos had married a second wife, Philonome, who had conceived
a passion for her stepson and had made amorous advances to him; but her love turned
to rancour when she found herself rejected, and she exacted revenge on him by telling
her husband that he had tried to seduce her. Kyknos believed her and became even
more convinced when she persuaded a ﬂautist, Eumolpos, to bear false witness to her
claim. So Kyknos locked Tenes into a chest along with his sister Hemithea, who had
spoken in support of him, and launched it into the sea. After it was washed ashore
on Tenedos (then known as Leukophrys), Tenes was invited to become the ruler of
the island, and renamed it after himself. When Kyknos eventually discovered that his
wife had deceived him, he exacted a pitiless revenge by burying her alive and stoning
Eumolpos to death. He then sailed off to Tenedos to seek his son’s forgiveness; but
when he moored his ship and tried to speak, Tenes was too embittered even to listen
and severed his mooring-ropes with an axe.59
There was a tradition that Apollo was the true father of Tenes, and that Thetis had fore-
seen that her son Achilles would meet an early death at the hand of Apollo if he killed a
son of that god; so she arranged that he should be accompanied by a servant called MNEMON
(Unforgetting), whose duty it was to keep him ever mindful of this danger. But Mnemon
forgot to warn him about Tenes, and Achilles was so angry to learn of his negligence that
he thrust a spear through his chest.60 As we shall see (p. 468), Apollo was said to have
killed Achilles (or to have helped Paris to kill him) in front of the walls of Troy.
PHILOKTETES, son of Poias, a great archer from southern Thessaly who was the
current owner of the bow of Herakles (see p. 285), was marooned by his comrades
in course of the sea-crossing. According to the Cypria, he was bitten by a snake
while he was feasting on Tenedos with his fellow-warriors, and was then abandoned
by them on Lemnos (some thirty miles to the west) because of the stench of his
wound.61 Sophocles offers a rather different account in his Philoktetes, indicating that
the hero was bitten at a place called Chryse by a snake that was guarding the roof-
less shrine of the goddess Chryse.62 Euripides apparently said much the same in the
prologue of his lost play of the same name, stating that Philoktetes was bitten as
he was guiding his comrades to the altar of Chryse to offer a sacriﬁce.63 The place
in question should doubtless be distinguished from the Chryse that is mentioned
in the Iliad as the home of the priest Chryses; Pausanias reports that it was an island
– evidently a very small one – that lay close to Lemnos until it was submerged
beneath the sea (presumably as the result of a seismic disturbance).64 Some later
sources suggest that Philoktetes suffered his wound at a shrine of Chryse on Lemnos
itself.65 In Hyginus’ version, Hera is said to have sent the snake against him on
Lemnos because she was angry with him for having helped Herakles by kindling
his funeral-pyre; or according to another suggestion, Chryse was an amorous nymph
who incited the snake to bite Philoktetes when he spurned her advances.66 Whatever
the exact circumstances of the wounding, his comrades were so disturbed by the
smell of his festering wound, and perhaps also by his ill-omened cries of pain, that
they abandoned him to his fate. By shooting wild birds with his bow, he survived

in isolation on Lemnos for almost ten years until he was ﬁnally rescued and brought
to Troy, where he was healed at last by a son of Asklepios (see p. 471).67 His predica-
ment is vividly portrayed in Sophocles’ Philoktetes, which tells how Odysseus and
Neoptolemos came to recover him; Lemnos is presented as an uninhabited island in
this connection68 (although this conﬂicts with other aspects of its mythology, most
notably in relation to the visit of the Argonauts, p. 384).
In a wholly different account of the wounding of Philoktetes from Latin sources, Herakles
had made him swear never to reveal the resting-place of his mortal remains, and had given
him his poisoned arrows by way of a reward. After learning from an oracle that they would
need the arrows during the Trojan War, the other Greeks had later questioned Philoktetes
about Herakles; and when he had ﬁnally told them that the hero was dead, they had insisted
that he should show them where the hero was buried. Wanting to preserve his oath in a
formal sense at least, he had said nothing but had indicated the hero’s burial-place with 
a stamp of his foot. He paid for his transgression nonetheless, for one of the poisoned arrows
fell from his quiver during the journey to Troy and inﬂicted an apparently incurable wound
on his foot. So his comrades abandoned him as in the usual story, after ﬁrst seizing the
remaining arrows.69
The Greek landing at Troy
On seeing the invasion-force sailing in from the sea, the Trojans attempted to prevent
the Greeks from landing by pelting their ships with stones. The ﬁrst Greek warrior
to leap ashore was PROTESILAOS, son of Iphiklos, who commanded the men from
Phylake (see p. 435) and the neighbouring cities of southern Thessaly. The main
features of his story are already noted in the Iliad, which mentions that he was killed
by a Dardanian warrior as soon as he landed, leaving a grieving wife in Phylake and
a half-completed house (for he was newly married). Subsequent sources from the
Cypria onward identify his killer as Hektor, doubtless because it seemed appropriate
that the ﬁrst enemy should be killed by the greatest of the defending warriors.
According to a tradition which is ﬁrst reported by Apollodorus (but may well have
been quite ancient), the ﬁrst man ashore was fated to be the ﬁrst to die, and Achilles
held back because he had been warned of this by Thetis.70 Or else this was commonly
known, and Protesilaos showed exceptional courage by leaping ashore when everyone
else was holding back.71
The unfortunate young wife of Protesilaos was LAODAMEIA, a daughter of
Akastos, king of Iolkos (except in the Cypria, in which she was named as Polydore,
daughter of Meleagros).72 The earliest record of her legend is contained in what we
can piece together of the lost Protesilaos of Euripides. In that tragedy, Protesilaos was
said to have left for the war after he had been married to Laodameia for only a single
day; and after his death, he prayed to the gods of the Underworld to be allowed to
return to her for an additional day. His wish was granted, but Laodameia apparently
took her own life when he had to depart.73 In another account, the dead Protesilaos
was brought to her after she herself had prayed to the gods to be allowed to meet him
for three hours, but she died of a broken heart after Hermes took him away again.74
Or else she made a bronze image of him to console herself after he was taken back to
Hades; and when a servant happened to see her embracing the statue while peeping
— The Trojan War —
450

through a crack in the door, he supposed that she had a lover and informed her father
Akastos. On bursting into the room, however, he saw that it was merely a statue, 
and tried to relieve her of her torment by having it burned. But this only served 
to increase her distress, and she jumped on to the pyre with it and was burned to
death.75 In yet another account, she fashioned such an image and consorted with it
as though it were her husband, arousing the pity of the gods, who arranged for
Hermes to bring Protesilaos up from Hades for a reunion. Supposing that he had
returned safely against all expectation, she was overjoyed to see him, and was so
distressed when he was taken away again that she took her own life.76
After the death of Protesilaos, Achilles jumped ashore at the head of his Thessalian
followers, the Myrmidons, and confronted KYKNOS, son of Poseidon, the most
formidable of the many warriors who were opposing the Greek landing. It is quite
possible that this Kyknos may be identiﬁed with the Kyknos who was the father
of Tenes (see p. 448), although this is never stated. He was especially dangerous
because his divine father had rendered him invulnerable (in the strict sense, i.e.
immune to piercing wounds); his name means ‘Swan’ in Greek, and it would seem
that he was suitably pale or perhaps an albino, since the Hesiodic Catalogue refers
to his ‘white head’ and Hellanicus stated that he was white-skinned from birth.77
Another tale suggests that he was tended by swans as an infant.78 Although the
Cypria is known to have recounted the story of his death, a passing allusion by
Aristotle provides the earliest evidence for his invulnerability (unless this can already
be inferred from a fragment of Sophocles’ Poimenes).79 Pindar mentions that Achilles
killed him without offering any details. Apollodorus reports, perhaps in accordance
with an early tradition, that Achilles caused his death by hurling a stone at his
head.80 Or in Ovid’s fuller narrative, Achilles lost his temper after ﬁnding that his
spear and sword made no impression on the body of Kyknos, and battered the face
of the invulnerable hero with the hilt of his sword. As Kyknos was retreating from
this onslaught, his withdrawal was blocked by a large boulder, and Achilles took
advantage of this to dash him to the ground. Achilles then kneeled down on him,
crushing his ribs with his shield, and killed him at last by throttling him with the
leather strap of his helmet. Ovid concludes by saying that Kyknos was turned into
a swan by his father Poseidon, but this was doubtless a Hellenistic innovation 
(if not a detail invented by Ovid himself).81
The Trojans were so dismayed by the death of Kyknos that they retreated towards
the safety of their city, and all the remaining Greeks now jumped out of their ships
and pursued the ﬂeeing enemy across the plain, covering it with dead bodies. As a
result of these events, the invaders established a ﬁrm grounding on the plain and
penned the Trojans behind their city walls. The long siege commenced.82
LEADING FIGURES IN THE CONFLICT
Priam and the Trojan royal family
At this point, we must turn aside to say something about the leading ﬁgures on either
side of the conﬂict. On the Trojan side, the many sons of Priam were most prominent

in battle and in the life of the city; Priam himself was too old to take part in the
ﬁghting, although he continued to be the fount of all authority at Troy. The Iliad
refers to twenty-two of his sons by name, and later sources add many further names
to the list (whether from the early tradition or as products of later invention); the
majority of them have no deﬁnite stories, or simply appear for a moment in an epic
battle-scene before they are killed or captured by a Greek opponent. Although Priam
complains in the Iliad that he has been robbed of most of his sons, he mentions the
names of only two who were killed in the earlier years of the conﬂict, namely Mestor,
whose legend has been lost, and Troilos,83 who was killed at an early point by
Achilles when he was little more than a child (see p. 462). Troilos is most familiar
nowadays for the medieval tale of his love for Cressida. Lykaon was another Priamid
who was surprised by Achilles outside the city walls at an early stage in the war;
Achilles spared his life, however, preferring to sell him into slavery abroad, but
proved to be less forbearing when he encountered him in battle for a second time 
after he had been ransomed (see p. 462). By virtue of his role as the prime defender
of Troy in the Iliad, Hektor stands out from the other Priamids as the greatest
warrior among them and as a hero of distinctive and rounded character; in the latter
respect, only Paris (who was no mean warrior in spite of his effeminate airs) is
remotely comparable. Hektor is portrayed in the Iliad not only as a brave and chival-
rous warrior who was surpassed by Achilles alone, but also as an affectionate husband
and father. He was married to Andromache, whose father Eetion and seven brothers
had been killed by Achilles during his sack of their city, Hypoplakian Thebes;84
the famous passage in the Iliad in which Hektor meets her on the ramparts before
setting out for battle is one of the most moving sections of the poem (as was felt in
classical Greece also, to judge by a remark in Plato’s Ion85). Their infant son Astyanax
(who is present at this meeting and is much alarmed by the nodding plume of
Hektor’s helmet) was destined to meet a gruesome death during the sack of Troy 
(see p. 477). Deiphobos and Helenos, who make occasional appearances in the Iliad
as notable sons of Priam, rose to their greatest prominence at the very end of the war.
They competed for the hand of Helen after the death of Paris, and Helenos was so
upset when she was awarded to his brother that he withdrew from the city to live 
on Mt Ida, where he was subsequently captured by Odysseus; for Helenos was a 
seer, and Odysseus had been advised by the Greek seer Kalchas that he could reveal
some conditions that would need to be fulﬁlled if Troy were to be taken (see pp.
471–2). Deiphobos lost Helen and his life also to Menelaos during the night of the
sack (see pp. 476–7), while Helenos, who had assured his own survival by the infor-
mation that he had revealed to the Greeks, accompanied Achilles’ son Neoptolemos
to Epirus (see p. 490). The Benjamin of the family, Polydoros, appears in the Iliad
as the youngest and dearest son of Priam who enters battle against his father’s order
and is soon killed by Achilles.86 According to a conﬂicting tale which ﬁrst appears in
tragedy, Priam tried to secure him from danger by sending him away to Polymestor,
a Thracian son-in-law of his, along with a quantity of treasure; but when the fortunes
of war turned against the Trojans, Polymestor murdered Polydoros to steal the
treasure (see p. 479).
— The Trojan War —
452

The daughters of Priam will be considered below in connection with the fall of Troy (see
pp. 479–80). Although three brothers of Priam appear in the Iliad among the elders who
meet on the ramparts,87 it was generally agreed in the later tradition that all the sons of
Laomedon apart from Priam were killed when Troy was stormed by Herakles (see p. 276).
As a child by his ﬁrst wife Arisbe (or a nymph called Alexirrhoe), Priam had a son
AISAKOS who possessed prophetic powers and was ﬁnally turned into a bird. Apollodorus
states that he married Asterope, a daughter of the river Kebren, and mourned for her so
grievously after her death that he was turned into a bird (of an unspeciﬁed kind).88 Or in
Ovid’s account, he fell in love with Hesperia, daughter of Kebren, after encountering her
by her father’s waters; but when he chased after her with amorous intent, she stepped on a
poisonous snake and was killed. He was so tormented by remorse that he hurled himself
into the sea, and so aroused the pity of the sea-goddess Tethys, who transformed him into
a bird, apparently a diver (mergus). He was by no means happy to have been rescued, however,
and dived repeatedly into the sea in his new form in the hope of ending his life, and grew
ever thinner, hence the form and habits of the diver.89 Some said that it was he who inter-
preted Hekabe’s dream before the birth of Paris (see p. 442).90
AINEIAS, the son of Anchises and Aphrodite (see pp. 200–1 for the story of his
birth), was the leading representative of the junior branch of the Trojan royal family,
which was descended from Assarakos, the younger brother of Priam’s grandfather
Ilos (see p. 522). He grew up on Mt Ida outside the city, where he had an unfor-
tunate encounter with Achilles early in the war (see p. 462). His branch of the
family had been cast into the shade by the senior branch that ruled from the city,
and the Iliad presents him as feeling some resentment at his position, especially
when he considers that Priam is failing to pay him the honour that he deserves. He
helps to defend Troy to the best of his power nonetheless, commanding his
Dardanians as a separate contingent with Antilochos and Akamas, two sons of
Antenor (see below), as his lieutenants.91 Although a warrior of standing, he is by
no means overwhelming in battle; indeed, he only survives his moments of greatest
peril because gods come to his aid, as when Aphrodite and Apollo save him from
Diomedes, and Poseidon from Achilles.92 Poseidon explains to the other gods on
the latter occasion that he is fated to survive because he and his descendants are
destined to rule over the Trojans after the destruction of Priam’s line.93 A far grander
destiny was assigned to him in the later tradition, as we will see in Chapter 17.
Some noble families at Troy, and the failure of the 
Greek embassy
Herodotus was inclined to accept that Helen had been in Egypt during the war (see
p. 445) because he was unable to believe that the Trojans would have refused to
surrender her if they had been able to, whether Paris wished it or not; but that 
would have spoiled the story of course, and there is no suggestion in mythical
accounts that real pressure was ever exerted on Paris to propitiate the Greeks by
handing her over. In a memorable scene in the Iliad, the Trojan elders see Helen
walking towards them while they are sitting together on the ramparts one day, and
remark that it is no shame (ou nemesis) that the Trojans and Greeks should have
suffered such woes for such a woman, who looks wondrously like an immortal

goddess; and if they add nonetheless that they wish that she would go away and cease
to be a curse to them and their children, this is merely a wish rather than the expres-
sion of an active desire.94 The matter was settled deﬁnitively, for good or ill, when
the Greeks sent envoys to Troy at the very beginning of the war (just after they
landed, or else just before while the ﬂeet was at Tenedos). The delegation was headed
by Menelaos and Odysseus, who declared that there would be no need for a war if
Helen were surrendered along with the treasures that had been stolen by Paris.
In so far as it is possible to talk of a ‘peace party’ and ‘war party’ at Troy, these
were headed by Antenor and Antimachos respectively, the senior members of two
noble families at Troy. The two Greek ambassadors received hospitality from
ANTENOR, a wise elder who was married to THEANO, the Trojan priestess of
Athena. Believing with some justiﬁcation that the Greek demands were legitimate,
Antenor argued to the Trojans at their assembly that they should yield on the points
in question, for it could bring them no good to ﬁght a war for a dishonourable
cause; but ANTIMACHOS turned the audience against him, even going so far as
to urge that the Greek ambassadors should be killed on the spot. Such is the story
recorded in the Iliad; and later sources add that it was only through the interven-
tion of Antenor that the two Greeks escaped with their lives.95 Homer attributes
mercenary motives to Antimachos, saying that he always took the lead in opposing
the return of Helen because Paris provided him with handsome gifts of gold; but
his ignoble behaviour brought nothing but pain to him in the long run, since
Agamemnon inﬂicted a brutal death on his two sons, Peisandros and Hippolochos,
after encountering them on the battleﬁeld, rejecting any thought of a ransom in
view of the conduct of their father.96 The Greeks were so impressed by Antenor’s
behaviour, on the other hand, that they hung a panther-skin on the door of his
house during the sack of Troy to indicate that his family and possessions were not
to be touched.97
If Antenor was motivated by considerations of justice in the earlier tradition, some late
accounts place a wholly different interpretation on his actions, presenting him as a traitor
who conspired with the Greeks for purely selﬁsh reasons, and even suggesting that he and
his wife betrayed the city to them by opening the city gates and the trap-door of the Wooden
Horse, or by helping them to steal the Palladion (a talisman that protected the city).98
Antenor had a number of sons, including AGENOR, who had his moment of glory when
he dared to make a stand against Achilles at the height of his advance while all the other
Trojans were in full ﬂight, desperately seeking the safety of the city walls. Agenor struck
ﬁrst with a throw of his spear, but to no effect since it bounced off Achilles’ leg-armour,
and he would doubtless have been killed in the Greek hero’s counter-attack if Apollo had
not wrapped him in a cloud of mist and spirited him away; Apollo then assumed his guise
to lure Achilles away while the rest of the Trojans were making their escape, leaving Hektor
alone to confront him.99 Agenor was ﬁnally killed by Neoptolemos, the son of Achilles,
during the sack of the city.100
Apart from the families of Antenor and Antimachos, only one other noble family, that
of the Panthoids, was of any real signiﬁcance. Its senior member PANTHOOS, who is
mentioned among the Trojan elders who met on the ramparts, had three sons, Polydamas
(or Poulydamas in epic parlance), Euphorbos and Hyperenor. POLYDAMAS was born on
the same night as Hektor, and was as renowned for his wisdom as Hektor was for his martial
prowess.101 He offers shrewd advice to Hektor on four occasions in the Iliad, but Hektor is
— The Trojan War —
454

not always patient enough to accept it. When Polydamas urges that the Trojans should
withdraw to the city after Achilles’ return to battle, Hektor brings disaster on himself and
many of his comrades by his disdainful response.102 Hektor comes to appreciate that he has
ample reason to be reproached for this, and his fear of Polydamas’ scorn is one of the main
factors that impel him to remain outside the city to confront Achilles on his own.103
EUPHORBOS, the other main son of Panthoos, inﬂicted the ﬁrst wound on Patroklos before
Hektor delivered the death-blow; but he was killed soon afterwards by Menelaos while trying
to avenge the death of his brother Hyperenor.104 The shield that Menelaos had supposedly
taken from Euphorbos on that occasion could be seen at the Heraion at Mycenae, or at
Branchidai in Asia Minor according to another claim.105 The sage Pythagoras, who believed
in the transmigration of the soul, claimed to have been Euphorbos in one of his previous
lives; and he was said to have authenticated the claim by identifying the shield of Euphorbos
in the temple of Apollo at Branchidai.106
The three greatest foreign allies of the Trojans – Penthesileia, Memnon and Eurypylos
– arrived towards the end of the war after the period covered in the Iliad (see 
pp. 466ff). A list of their other main allies can be found at the end of the second book
of the Iliad.107
The Atreids and the greater and lesser Aias
Of the many Greek leaders, a few deserve special mention. In Homer and the later
tradition alike, AGAMEMNON, the brother of the wronged Menelaos, appears as
a man who owes his great prestige to his high position as king of Mycenae rather
than to any outstanding personal merits of his own, even though he is brave and
effective enough as a warrior. He lacks a sure touch in dealing with his fellow-
leaders, who, it should be remembered, are not formally subject to his orders; for
he tends to act in an abrupt and high-handed manner, and is yet not sufﬁciently
resolute to provide a proper lead in the face of misfortune, tending to fall into
despondency when the army is threatened with a serious reverse. These features of
his character are central to the plot of the Iliad as we shall see. MENELAOS is
somewhat eclipsed by his more eminent brother, and in Homer’s portrait at least
is a man of less distinctive character; as a warrior, he is not in the very ﬁrst rank,
although efﬁcient; Achilles, Agamemnon, Aias, Diomedes and, in the other camp,
Hektor, outclass him. He is a noble ﬁgure nonetheless in the early tradition; and
the hostile portrayals of him in Attic tragedy, which are coloured by anti-Spartan
sentiment, should not be taken as representative. The two brothers are often referred
to as the Atreidai (i.e. sons of Atreus); they belonged to the Pelopid family, which
had originated in Asia Minor but had come to rule at Mycenae and Sparta by the
time of the Trojan War, replacing the original ruling families. The bloody history
of the family, which was notorious for its internal feuds, will be traced in full in
the next chapter.
The most formidable warriors on the Greek side were Achilles and the greater or
Telamonian AIAS (or AJAX in Latin form). Aias was the only legitimate son of
Telamon, who had been the main ally of Herakles during the ﬁrst Greek war against
Troy (see p. 276); as the commander of a relatively small contingent that he had
brought from his native Salamis in twelve ships,108 Aias owed his predominance to

his personal qualities alone. In contrast to most heroes of the ﬁrst rank, who are
expected to be accomplished as well as brave, he is slow-witted and a poor speaker
in Homer’s portrait, but he possesses a certain bluff common sense, is straightfor-
ward, loyal and utterly dependable, and his courage is unshakeable. Known as the
‘bulwark of the Achaeans’, he is tall, thick-set and immensely strong, and he defends
himself with a towering shield of Mycenaean design, which is formed from seven
layers of bull’s hide under an outer layer of bronze.109 He is as handy at wielding
large stones as more conventional weapons, and is especially effective when the situ-
ation seems to be most hopeless. With his courage go self-will and pride, the latter
ﬁnally causing his ruin when the arms of the dead Achilles are awarded to Odysseus
rather than to himself (see p. 470). He often ﬁghts in the company of his half-
brother Teukros, who is a skilled archer, and of his namesake, the lesser Aias, son
of Oileus, who led a sizeable contingent of troops from his native Locris in Central
Greece. As swift-moving light-armed warriors, both could take shelter behind Aias
and his mighty shield and emerge into the open as circumstances demanded.110
Of opposite nature in many ways to the greater Aias, the lesser or Locrian Aias is lightly
built and ﬁghts as a light-armed skirmisher accordingly, wearing only a linen corselet for
protection, and relying on his speed and skill as a spearsman rather than any exceptional
strength. Though a splendid ﬁghter in his fashion, he is a man of unappealing character
who is vicious, quarrelsome and impious, and he is disliked accordingly by the other warriors.
This is illustrated in the Iliad by the manner in which he interacts with his comrades at
the funeral-games for Achilles; he abuses Idomoneus in a most insulting manner, provoking
that hero to retort that he is the meanest of all the Greeks in everything apart from abuse;
and his other comrades are happy to laugh at him shortly afterwards during the foot-race
when Athena causes him to slip headﬁrst into some cow-dung to prevent him from defeating
Odysseus.111 He was apparently far more prominent in the later epics in the Trojan cycle.
As we will see, he committed a brutal act of sacrilege during the sack of Troy (see p. 478),
so angering Athena that she imperilled many of his comrades during their return voyage
and caused his own death (see pp. 482ff).
The earlier life of Achilles and his recruitment
Pre-eminent among the Greeks at Troy, greater even than Aias as a warrior and
greater than him in other respects, is ACHILLES (properly Achilleus or Achileus),
the son of Peleus, king of Phthia in southern Thessaly. Partly of divine descent
through his mother, the Nereid Thetis, he is the strongest, swiftest, handsomest
and most valiant warrior in the army. His troops, the Myrmidons (and also the
Thessalian Hellenes and Achaeans), who had accompanied him to Troy in ﬁfty ships,
provide him with a worthy command.112 Although he and the Telamonian Aias are
unrelated as yet in the Iliad, the pair came to be classed together as cousins, as
grandsons of Aiakos, king of Aegina, and members of a common branch of the
Asopid family (see pp. 529ff). His family background will be considered in that
connection; for the circumstances of his birth, and his mother’s early abandonment
of him, see also pp. 54–5.
According to a story that ﬁrst appears in Roman sources, his mother rendered
him invulnerable soon after his birth by dipping him into the waters of the Styx,
— The Trojan War —
456

one of the rivers of the Underworld.113 He was not wholly protected, however, since
she was gripping him by one of his ankles and that part of his body never came
into contact with the water; it was thus possible for him to suffer a wound in the
ankle, as was agreed to have been the cause of his death (see p. 468). A tradition
of earlier origin claimed a similar invulnerability for Aias; for it was said that
Herakles wrapped the baby Aias in his impenetrable lionskin (from the invulner-
able Nemean lion, see p. 256) and prayed to his father Zeus to make him
invulnerable likewise. Once again, however, the protection was incomplete, since
Herakles’ quiver was lying in the lionskin and prevented Aias’ ribs from coming
into contact with the skin; and it was thus possible for him to kill himself by falling
on his sword, as he was traditionally supposed to have done (see p. 471). Although
the story is ﬁrst recorded in this form in Lycophron and his scholia, a fragment
from Aeschylus already refers to the partial invulnerability of Aias, and Pindar
mentions (apparently in accordance with a Hesiodic account) that Herakles prayed
before the birth of Aias that Telamon should have a son who would share the quality
of the lionskin.114 This theme of a conditional invulnerability or immortality appears
with some regularity in Greek myth; it could be said that such stories merely serve
to emphasize the limitations of the mortal condition.

After being abandoned by his divine wife, who did not care to live with a mortal,
Peleus entrusted the young Achilles to the Centaur Cheiron to be reared on Mt
Pelion. To ensure that Achilles would come to share in the strength and courage
of the most fearless of wild beasts, Cheiron fed him on the ﬂesh and viscera of boars
and lions and the marrows of bears; and the young hero developed his valour and
martial skills by hunting savage lions and boars in the wild hill-country around
Cheiron’s cave. He also learned to move with exceptional speed by running down
stags without the help of dogs. Cheiron educated him, furthermore, in the arts of
war and the more peaceful skills of medicine (as mentioned in the Iliad) and
music.115 Homer adds that he spent part of his childhood with Phoinix, son of
Amyntor, the king of the Dolopians, who instructed him in the art of public
speaking and other practical matters.116
Phoinix had become a vassal of Achilles’ father in the following circumstances. Amyntor, the
father of Phoenix, had upset his wife by neglecting her in favour of a concubine, and she had
persuaded her son to seduce the girl in the hope that experience of the love of a younger man
would turn her against her aged lover. Amyntor had cursed his son to the Erinyes (Furies) on
hearing of this, praying that he should be childless (as would indeed be the case); and Phoinix
had left home as a consequence, and had sought the help of Peleus, who had installed him as
king of the Dolopians (Dolopes) in a territory adjoining his own.117 In some post-Homeric
accounts, Phoinix is said to have been blinded by his father but cured afterwards by
Cheiron.118 Amyntor ruled either at Eleon, a town in Boeotia, or at Ormenion under Mt
Pelion in Thessaly; for his confrontation with Herakles as king of Ormenion, see p. 283.
Achilles ﬁnally returned to his father’s court as a highly accomplished young man,
and it was from there that Nestor and Odysseus recruited him for the Trojan War
in the earliest account in the Iliad.119 In the standard later tradition, however, Thetis
was said to have hidden him away on Scyros, an island to the east of Euboea, because
she knew that he was fated to meet a premature death if he took part in the war.
Or else Peleus took him to the island. He was left under the care of its ruler,
Lykomedes, and lived among the maidens of the court in female disguise.120 When
rumours about his hiding-place eventually seeped out, Odysseus travelled to Skyros
to investigate, either on his own or with Diomedes. To trick the young hero into
betraying himself, Odysseus presented some ﬁne clothing and trinkets to the women
and girls of the court, mixing a few weapons among them, and Achilles duly revealed
his true sex by reaching out for the weapons.121 Or in a more elaborate account,
Odysseus placed some women’s goods in the forecourt of the palace along with a
shield and a spear, and then arranged for a trumpet to be sounded to the accom-
paniment of shouts and the clashing of arms; imagining that the palace was under
attack, Achilles immediately stripped off his women’ clothing and seized the shield
and spear.122 After his identity was discovered by such means, he willingly agreed
to depart for the war.
While Achilles was hiding among the maidens of the palace, he embarked on a
love affair with DEIDAMEIA, a daughter of the king, causing her to become preg-
nant with a son, Neoptolemos (also known as Pyrrhos), who would become a great
warrior like his father and ﬁght at Troy in the last stages of the war (see p. 472).123
This feature of the legend of Achilles was certainly very ancient, for the Iliad already
— The Trojan War —
458

mentions that he had a son on Skyros and the Cypria told of his love for Deidameia.
In the latter epic, however, he met her at a slightly later time than in the story
above and in different circumstances, when he happened to call in at Scyros as he
was sailing home after the ﬁrst crossing ended in misfortune (see p. 446 for the
circumstances).124
Odysseus and Palamedes
ODYSSEUS was a hero of idiosyncratic character who relied as much on ingenuity,
or even sheer unscrupulousness, to win his ends as on his undoubted valour and
resource. He was the king of rocky Ithaca, an island off the west coast of Central
Greece, and the husband of the faithful Penelope and father of Telemachos, who
was still a child when the war broke out. During the war, he was prominent in
every episode that required quick wits; in battle he was formidable but not one of
the very foremost champions; when lots are cast in the Iliad to see who shall ﬁght
Hektor, for instance, the Greeks pray that the lot may fall upon the greater Aias,
Diomedes or Agamemnon (Achilles being absent) rather than on Odysseus, although
he has volunteered.125 Besides giving helpful and shrewd advice on many occasions,
it is he who volunteers, among others, to go with Diomedes on the perilous night-
expedition in the tenth book of the epic, and is chosen by Diomedes ‘because he
can use his wits exceedingly well’.126 He and Diomedes are often represented as
acting in conjunction, both in the Iliad and in the subsequent tradition. Their
greatest joint enterprise was the theft of the Palladion in the last stages of the war
(see p. 472).
After Homer, the character of Odysseus suffers a remarkable degeneration. In the
Odyssey, he is at times unscrupulous; but from the cyclic epics onward, and espe-
cially in Attic tragedy, he is often presented as a thoroughly villainous double-dealer.
His conduct toward PALAMEDES was particularly vile, all the more so because he
involved Diomedes in his foul dealing. Palamedes, the eldest son of Nauplios (see 
pp. 235–6), was quite as clever as Odysseus himself, and was credited with all manner
of inventions, ranging from dice and draughts to measures and weights; above all, 
he was often said to have devised all or part of the Greek alphabet.127 When Menelaos
and Nestor (or the two Atreids) travelled to Ithaca to recruit Odysseus for the Trojan
War, Palamedes accompanied them and incurred the undying enmity of Odysseus 
by exposing him when he feigned madness in the hope of avoiding the war. For
although he was bound by oath to take part as a former suitor of Helen, he was by
no means eager to do so (perhaps because he had received an oracle warning him 
that he would return alone after twenty years128). So he yoked two ill-assorted beasts
together, an ox and a horse or ass, to plough his ﬁelds, and also sowed the furrows
with salt instead of grain in some accounts. Palamedes saw through his pretence,
however, and placed his infant son in front of the plough to show that he was quite
sane enough to avoid him, or else threatened the child with a sword to show that
Odysseus was sane enough to rush to his rescue.129 Odysseus was embittered against
Palamedes from that time forth, and became all the more so when Palamedes won
great popularity among the troops for his useful and diverting inventions; and he
therefore contrived his death during the early years of the siege of Troy. In the

earliest version in the Cypria, he and Diomedes drowned him while he was out
ﬁshing.130 Or he forged a letter under the name of Priam promising Palamedes a 
large sum of gold for betraying his fellow Greeks, and ensured that the message
would be discovered on the body of a murdered prisoner. When it was subsequently
read out in front of Agamemnon and the other leaders, they agreed that Palamedes’
tent should be searched, and discovered quantities of gold that had been hidden 
there beforehand by Odysseus; and Palamedes was condemned accordingly and 
stoned to death.131
There was also an account in which Odysseus, Agamemnon and Diomedes plotted together
to cause the death of Palamedes (by much the same means as in the preceding story) because
they were jealous of the popularity that he had gained with the troops.132 Or in a late
account, Odysseus and Diomedes told Palamedes that some treasure had been hidden in a
well and hurled stones down on him after he descended to look for it.133
This murder, however contrived, would have fateful consequences, since Nauplios, the
father of Palamedes, would later avenge it by luring many Greeks to their death as they were
sailing home from Troy (see p. 485). In a lost play by Euripides, Oiax, a son of Nauplios 
who was also serving at Troy, informed his father of the murder by inscribing the story 
on oar-blades and tossing them into the sea (rather like a message in a bottle), a splendidly 
impractical means of communication which is mocked by Aristophanes in the Thesmo-
phoriazusae.134
Nestor and Diomedes
If NESTOR is one of the best-known characters in the mythology of the Trojan
War, this is largely because of the affectionate and yet humorous portrayal of him
in the Iliad. As the only surviving son of Neleus (for all the rest had all been killed
by Herakles, see p. 278), he was the king of sandy Pylos on the western coast of
the Peloponnese. See p. 424 for his family background. Since he was much older
than the other leaders, over sixty at the period covered in the Iliad,135 he was unable
to achieve as much as he might have wished in the ﬁeld, but he was highly valued
nonetheless for his wise counsels and long-winded but engaging reminiscences. He
always shows himself as a peace-maker when the younger leaders quarrel in the Iliad,
and in the ﬁrst part of the epic, his advice is Agamemnon’s chief guide; but after
he fails in his scheme to bring about a reconciliation between Agamemnon and
Achilles by sending a delegation to the latter (see p. 463), he slips somewhat into
the background, his place being taken in large measure by Diomedes, who has an
old head on young shoulders.
Nestor was accompanied to the war by two of his sons, his eldest son Antilochos,
who became a close friend of Achilles, and also Thrasymedes. Antilochos was
destined to be killed toward the end of the war while rescuing his father from death
(see p. 468). Nestor arrived home safely, however, along with Thrasymedes, and
both appear in the Odyssey in scenes set after the war. He welcomes Telemachos, the
young son of Odysseus, to his court in the third book of that epic, in which he is
shown as enjoying a digniﬁed old age. He is much the same as ever, still full of
good advice and old stories, and has only a single serious regret, that he has lost
his eldest son.
— The Trojan War —
460

From among the other leading warriors, DIOMEDES in particular deserves to be
singled out. Of Aetolian descent as the son of Tydeus, Polyneikes’ old comrade
during the Theban War (see p. 418), he had married a daughter of Adrastos, king
of Argos, and had inherited the kingdom of his father-in-law (see p. 333 for the
circumstances). He was therefore a powerful ruler of comparable rank to Agamem-
non, and led a large force of troops to Troy from Argos, Tiryns and the eastern
Argolid, with Sthenelos and Euryalos (see p. 334) as his lieutenants.136 He is promi-
nent throughout the Iliad, both for his valour and also, especially from the tenth
book onward, for his frank and judicious advice to Agamemnon. Like his father
before him, he is particularly favoured by Athena, who inspires him to dominate
the ﬁghting in the ﬁfth book of the epic, and even to confront deities. Although
he is shot in the shoulder by Pandaros, he kills him soon afterwards and then knocks
Aineias to the ground by striking him on the hip with a stone; and when Aphrodite
comes to the aid of Aineias (who is her son), he stabs her in the wrist with his
spear, causing her to ﬂee up to Olympos to seek a cure for the pain.137 Shortly after-
wards, when he attacks Aineias again, who is now protected by Apollo, the god
pushes him back three times and ﬁnally warns him not to measure himself against
the immortal gods.138 He subsequently wounds Ares in the belly all the same, with
some help from Athena, causing him to scream as loudly as nine or ten thousand
men and ﬂee up to Olympos for relief (see p. 168).139 Although Diomedes is
undoubtedly a hero of the highest rank, he is nevertheless a rather colourless ﬁgure
who lacks the individual character of an Achilles, Aias or Odysseus. He returned
home safely to Argos after the fall of Troy. In the post-epic tradition, however, he
was greeted with fresh trouble at home, for his wife had deserted him for another
man at the incitement of Aphrodite, and he was driven into exile in southern Italy
(see further on pp. 483 and 487).
Pindar states that Athena turned Diomedes into an immortal god; and according to the rele-
vant scholia, the poet Ibycus said the same, adding that he married Hermione and lived
with the Dioskouroi during his new existence. As was remarked above, Diomedes’ father
Tydeus had been a favourite of Athena, and she had intended to confer immortality on him
until she was deterred at the last moment (see p. 320 for the circumstances); and according
to Pherecydes, Tydeus prayed before dying that she should confer this beneﬁt on his son
instead.140 He was worshipped as a god in some places in southern Italy, notably Metapontum
and Thurii.141 His shield could be seen in the temple of Athena in Argos, and the people
of that city also liked to believe that he had deposited the Palladion with them142 (although
this particular relic was claimed by many other places, including Sparta and Rome).
THE COURSE OF THE WAR AND THE 
SACK OF TROY
The earlier years of the war
For the ﬁrst nine years of the war, the Trojans avoided direct contact with the
enemy, preferring to shelter behind their city walls in the hope that the Greeks
would eventually become exhausted by the siege. This calculation was not altogether

unsound, since the invaders often ran short of food and became demoralized by the
stalemate; according to the Cypria, indeed, they might have sailed home at one point
if Achilles had not restrained them.143 To raise the spirits of the troops and to
deprive the Trojans of supplies and support, the Greeks conducted raids against
settlements in the area and also against islands and cities further down the coast,
ranging as far south as Clazomenae and Colophon in some accounts.144 Although
Priam’s stronghold itself, heavily garrisoned as it was and defended by a consider-
able force of Trojan and allied troops, was impregnable to the rudimentary
siege-operations of the period, the Greek campaign of attrition started to wear down
the king’s resources and made it impossible for him to replenish them by trade.
Achilles took the lead in the Greek raids, and also rustled the cattle of Aineias
on Mt Ida145 and caught two sons of Priam outside the city walls. He captured
LYKAON as he was cutting ﬁg-wood for chariot-rails in his father’s orchard at
night, but spared his life on that occasion, choosing instead to sell him into slavery
on Lemnos, where he was purchased by a son of Jason (apparently Euneos; see 
p. 384 for the circumstances of his birth). He was eventually ransomed, however,
and spent eleven days with his friends before entering battle on the twelfth (for we
are now in the period covered by the Iliad, after direct hostilities had resumed); and
when he had the misfortune to encounter Achilles for a second time, he was slaugh-
tered without mercy, plead though he might.146 In what is perhaps the most famous
episode from the early years of the war, Achilles ambushed another son of Priam,
TROILOS, when he ventured out of the city with his sister Polyxena to fetch water
from a fountain-house. As can be seen in vase-paintings of the incident, Troilos was
very young, hardly more than a child. Although his death is mentioned by Priam
in the Iliad,147 no details are offered there or in any other pre-Hellenistic source,
and we have to rely on visual images to gain an idea of how the story would have
been told in the earliest tradition. On the François vase, which can be dated to
about 570 BC, Achilles can be seen pursuing the beardless Troilos as he tries to
escape on his horse, and a woman, almost certainly Polyxena as in other images of
the kind, is shown running away ahead of them. Or on other vases, Achilles drags
Troilos from his horse by his hair, or kills him at an altar. In a later version of this
myth, as ﬁrst recorded by Lycophron, Achilles conceived a passion for Troilos and
pursued him with amorous intent, causing him to take sanctuary in the shrine of
Thymbraian Apollo. On ﬁnding that he could neither win the youth over nor
persuade him to leave the shrine, Achilles lost his temper and decapitated him at
the altar.148 Other reports from the later tradition explain his murder of the help-
less youth by saying that a prophecy had declared that Troy would be impregnable
if he survived to the age of twenty, or that his death was one of the preconditions
for the fall of the city.149 As a ﬁction of medieval origin, the story of his romance
with Cressida lies beyond the scope of the present work.150
The events of the Iliad
The events narrated in the Iliad are set in the tenth and ﬁnal year of the war. By
contrast to the other epics in the Trojan cycle, which were composed somewhat later
(even if most of their content would probably have been familiar to Homer), the
— The Trojan War —
462

Iliad has a very limited time-scale, and the bulk of the poem is devoted to four
crucial days in the ﬁghting. It is announced at the beginning of the poem that its
theme will be the anger of Achilles, as provoked by a quarrel between him and the
leader of the expedition, Agamemnon, who offended his pride by depriving him of
his concubine and valued war-prize, BRISEIS. Agamemnon had been awarded a
similar war-prize, a captive woman called CHRYSEIS, but her father Chryses, who
was a priest of Apollo, had come to the Greek camp to request her ransom; and
when Agamemnon had sent him away under threat of violence, he had prayed for
vengeance to Apollo, who had proceeded to shoot arrows into the Greek camp to
cause a plague. When the seer Kalchas had explained the cause of the disease, stating
that it could be brought to an end only if Chryseis were returned to her father
without demand of a ransom, Agamemnon had reluctantly agreed to surrender her;
but he had insisted on being compensated for his loss, and had reacted to some crit-
ical comments from Achilles by telling him to hand over Briseis for that purpose.
Now Achilles was greatly attached to her, and would have regarded this as an unac-
ceptable slight to his honour in any case. So he withdrew his allegiance from
Agamemnon and stayed away from the ﬁghting, taking his Myrmidon followers and
friend Patroklos with him.151 When deprived in this way of their foremost cham-
pion, the Greeks at last became vulnerable to Trojan attack; and although they
managed to hold their ground for a time while Diomedes was dominating the ﬁeld,
they were soon driven back to their camp by the shore, and were obliged to fortify
it with a ditch and a wall.152 The Trojans were then able to camp out on the plain
for the ﬁrst time since the Greek landing, their watch-ﬁres shining out like count-
less stars on a clear windless night.153
At the urging of Nestor and the other leaders, Agamemnon now agreed to seek
a reconciliation with Achilles, and sent Phoinix, Odysseus and the Telamonian Aias
to him as envoys to promise him the return of Briseis and valuable compensation
besides, including marriage to a daughter of Agamemnon and seven cities as her

dowry if the war should be brought to a successful conclusion. Each of the envoys
pressed him to accept these terms, Odysseus speaking ﬁrst and then old Phoinix,
who was able to appeal to him in more personal terms because he had known him
since his childhood, having acted as his tutor for a period. He failed to sway the
embittered Achilles, however, and the last speaker, Aias, was not much more success-
ful, even though his inarticulate appeal proved to be more effective than the eloquent
speeches of his companions. Achilles would promise no more than to reconsider his
position if the enemy should break through to the Greek camp and begin to set
ﬁre to the ships. He deﬁnitely put himself in the wrong by rejecting these princely
overtures; and there is thus a certain poetic justice in the heavy misfortune that
befell him afterwards when he lost his closest friend.154
On the following day, the Greeks conducted a successful counter-attack with
Agamemnon at the forefront, almost driving the Trojans back into their city; but
the Greek fortunes turned as Agamemnon, Diomedes and Odysseus were succes-
sively wounded; and when Hektor then returned to the ﬁghting (for Zeus had warned
him to stay away as long as Agamemnon was in the ﬁeld), the tide of the battle
was soon reversed and the Greeks were driven back towards their ships.155 Attacking
the Greek wall with several columns at once, Hektor broached the gate with a huge
stone and led the Trojans through to the ships in the face of determined opposi-
tion from Aias.156 When they were almost in a position to set ﬁre to the ships, and
had actually kindled the stern of one of them, Achilles yielded to the pleas of his
favourite retainer PATROKLOS, who had witnessed the disaster, and allowed him
to borrow his armour and enter battle at the head of the Myrmidons. Supposing
that they were under attack from Achilles himself, the Trojans retreated in disorder,
suffering many losses as Patroklos pursued them almost up to the city walls. By
taking the pursuit this far, he was disobeying the orders of Achilles, who had told
him to come back safely after driving the enemy from the ships; and he was killed
under the walls owing to the intervention of Apollo, who knocked his helmet and
armour from his body, leaving him dazed and exposed. Euphorbos, son of Panthoos,
took advantage of the situation to wound him in the back with his spear, and Hektor
ﬁnished him off with a spear-thrust to the belly.157
During the ensuing struggle for the body of Patroklos, Menelaos killed Euphorbos,
but was pressed back by the Trojans under the leadership of Hektor, who then
stripped Achilles’ armour from the corpse; the Greeks ﬁnally managed to recover
the corpse, however, and carried it back toward the ships with the Trojans in close
pursuit. On hearing of his friend’s death, Achilles lamented so bitterly that his
mother Thetis rose up from the sea with her sister-Nereids to investigate. He told
her that he was determined to avenge the death of Patroklos by killing Hektor,
even though he was warned by her that he would be fated to meet his own death
soon afterwards. After she left to fetch him a new set of armour from Hephaistos,
he took some immediate action on the advice of the divine messenger Iris, by
advancing to the trench that protected the camp and giving three mighty shouts
to cast fear into the Trojans. On hearing him, they fell back in alarm, giving the
Greeks an opportunity to remove the corpse of Patroklos from the ﬁeld.158 After
receiving his new armour from Thetis early on the following morning, Achilles
summoned an assembly to settle his differences with Agamemnon. He formally
— The Trojan War —
464

renounced his anger, while Agamemnon offered a rather grudging apology and
offered to pay due compensation.
After returning to battle, Achilles soon routed the Trojans, slaughtering many of
them with great brutality and angering the river-god Skamandros by choking his
waters with corpses (see p. 42). He might even have forced his way into the city if
Apollo had not intervened, ﬁrst by inciting Agenor to make a stand and then by
luring Achilles away in the guise of Agenor (see p. 454). All the Trojan warriors
were able to escape back into the city as a consequence, leaving Hektor alone to
confront Achilles outside the city walls. On seeing Achilles advancing toward him
like a war-god, Hektor lost his nerve and took to ﬂight; but after he had been
pursued three times around the walls, Athena appeared to him in the guise of his
brother Deiphobos to trick him into making a stand. He was fatally wounded in
the ensuing duel with a spear-wound to the neck. Although he pleaded with Achilles
to allow his body to be ransomed to his parents for an honourable burial, Achilles
threaded leather thongs through his ankles after his death, attached the corpse to
his chariot, and dragged it past the city in full sight of the Trojans and then down
to the Greek camp.159 After the funeral of Patroklos and the splendid funeral-games
that followed,160 Achilles continued to brood over Patroklos’ death and to mistreat
Hektor’s corpse for eleven days, until the gods ﬁnally intervened. Thetis was
dispatched to her son to order him to accept a ransom for Hektor’s body, while Iris
visited Priam to order him to bring a ransom to Achilles. So Priam made a secret
visit to the Greek camp at night under the guidance of Hermes, and appealed as a
suppliant to Achilles, who was at last moved to pity and joined with the old man
in lamenting the sorrows of the war. Achilles sent him away with his son’s body
on the following morning, and the poem ends with Hektor’s funeral.161
Three foreign allies of the Trojans: Rhesos, Penthesileia 
and Memnon
The Greeks were never entirely able to sever the communications between the
Trojans and their numerous allies in Thrace and Asia. These allies can be divided
into two main groups, those who are listed in the catalogue of Trojan forces at the
end of the second book of the Iliad162 (most of whom were apparently present from
the early years of the war), and the handful of allies of more exotic character who
arrived in the last stages of the war. Few signiﬁcant heroes are to be found among
the allies of the ﬁrst group; only Sarpedon and Glaukos, from Lycia in the south-
western corner of Asia Minor (see pp. 349–50), are of any real importance. Sarpedon
was the most prominent victim of Patroklos; after his death, Zeus ordered Hypnos
and Thanatos (Sleep and Death) to carry his body home to Lycia (see p. 30). The
ﬁrst of the more exotic allies was the Thracian king Rhesos, whose arrival and speedy
death are described in the Iliad; the adventures of the others – the Amazon Pen-
thesileia, the Ethiopian Memnon, and Eurypylos, son of Telephos – were recounted
in the next two epics in the Trojan cycle, the Aithiopis and the Little Iliad. These
latter ﬁgures were warriors of the highest stature who were capable of presenting a
genuine threat to the Greeks. They might have remained as familiar as Hektor if
we still possessed the early epics that commemorated their exploits; a late epic

— The Trojan War —

account of the last stages of the war can be found in the Posthomerica of Quintus of
Smyrna, a poem composed in the fourth century AD.163
By calling RHESOS a son of the Thracian king Eioneus, Homer differs from later
authors, who generally state that he was borne to the Thracian river-god Strymon by
one or other of the Muses.164 In the Homeric account, he arrived at Troy with some
Thracian followers on the night before the Trojan attack on the Greek ships, and
camped some distance away from the main Greek force. His horses were whiter than
snow and swifter than the wind, his chariot was fashioned from gold and silver, and
his magniﬁcent golden armour seemed more suitable for a god than a mortal. During
his ﬁrst night at Troy, which was fated to be his last, Odysseus and Diomedes
happened to creep out as scouts to check on what the enemy were doing; and they
ran across Dolon, a none too heroic Trojan who had set out on a comparable mission.
Dolon was dressed in a wolf’s skin, and had undertaken the mission after Hektor had
promised to give him the chariot and divine horses of Achilles. Overcome with terror,
he soon informed his captors about the dispositions of the Trojans and about their
new ally in particular; but it brought him no beneﬁt since Diomedes cut off his 
head all the same. As a result of this stroke of fortune, the two Greeks were able to
catch the Thracians in their sleep. Diomedes put Rhesos and twelve of his companions
to the sword while Odysseus seized the snow-white horses.165 Later sources cite
prophecies to justify this nocturnal slaughter. According to the Rhesos, a surviving
play on the episode which is dubiously ascribed to Euripides, Athena had revealed
that no Greek would be able to withstand Rhesos if he should live through the night;
or in another account, an oracle had revealed that Troy would be impregnable if
Rhesos’ horses grazed on the plain or drank from the Skamandros.166 In a version
ascribed to Pindar, Hera and Athena advised the night-raid after Rhesos had fought
against the Greeks for a day, inﬂicting great damage on them.167
When the fortunes of the Trojans were at a low ebb after the death of Hektor, a
force of Amazons arrived at Troy under the leadership of PENTHESILEIA, who was
a daughter of the war-god Ares by Otrere, queen of the Amazons. She had come to
seek puriﬁcation from Priam after accidentally killing a relative, or else to seek glory
in battle since it was a law of the Amazons that they must do so if they were to
be allowed to consort with men.168 She fought bravely, killing many of the Greeks,
including Machaon, son of Asklepios, until she was ﬁnally killed in her turn by
Achilles, who admired her prowess and mourned for her after her death. Her legend
was recounted in the Aithiopis, the next epic in the Trojan cycle after the Iliad, as
was the legend of Memnon, king of the Ethiopians.169 Although this epic would
presumably have been very different in tone from the Iliad, allowing freer rein to
the fantastical, the Homeric epic does refer to the Amazons on two occasions, as
former adversaries of Bellerophon (see p. 434) and of Priam (who had helped to
defeat them in his younger days when they had invaded neighbouring Phrygia).170
Achilles’ sympathy with the dead Amazon was greeted with scorn by the brutish
THERSITES, who made fun of him, saying that he had fallen in love with her. He
also mutilated her corpse in some accounts, by gouging out one or both of her eyes
with the point of his spear. Achilles lost his temper and killed him with a blow to
the face; and since the slaying caused dissension in the Greek camp, he sailed away
to Lesbos afterwards to be puriﬁed. The rites were performed by Odysseus after
— The Trojan War —
466

Achilles had ﬁrst offered sacriﬁces to Apollo, Artemis and Leto. This puriﬁcation
from the Aithiopis is the ﬁrst to be attested in Greek literature (for there is no
mention of this procedure in the Homeric epics).171
We ﬁrst encountered Thersites as a member of the Aetolian royal family who joined together
with his brothers, the sons of Agrios, to depose and maltreat Oineus, the king of Calydon,
their aged uncle; unlike most of his brothers, he escaped the retribution that he richly
deserved (see p. 419). In the Iliad, however, he is presented as a man of low birth, a foul-
tongued troublemaker who likes to abuse his betters and is the ugliest of all the men who
went to Troy. When he reviles the kings in his usual manner at the great assembly that is
convened after the withdrawal of Achilles, he is soon silenced by Odysseus, who exposes him
to general ridicule by beating him on the back and shoulders with his golden sceptre.172
Although the surviving summary of the Aithiopis says nothing about his origins, it is unlikely
that he was a mere commoner (let alone the uncouth ﬁgure portrayed in the Iliad) if his killing
provoked serious discord among the other Greeks; it may even be the case that Diomedes (who
was a grandson of Oineus and thus a kinsman of Thersites) already took the lead in objecting
to Achilles’ action as in the late epic of Quintus of Smyrna.173 Since Homer describes him as
being lame and generally misshapen, a tale was invented in later times to account for his
condition; for it was claimed that while he was participating in the hunt for the Calydonian
boar, he deserted his position in terror, to the great anger of Meleagros, the leader of the hunt,
who responded by throwing (or chasing) him over a cliff.174

Soon after the death of Penthesileia, MEMNON, son of Eos (Dawn) and Tithonos,
arrived at Troy with a force of Ethiopians. Although his people, the Aithiopes or
‘Burnt-faces’, came to be identiﬁed with the black Africans who lived in the lands
to the south of Egypt, they were originally a purely mythical people who lived near
the sunrise at the edges of the earth; and Memnon’s kingdom was usually located
in the east accordingly, whether in a mythical region beyond the known world or
in Syria or Persia. It was often said that he came from Susa, the old administrative
capital of Persia.175 Some later authors, writing when the Ethiopians had come to
be associated primarily with Africa, suggest that Memnon had led his Ethiopians
out of their original homeland in Africa to win a kingdom in Asia.176 Memnon was
the last and perhaps the most formidable of the opponents of Achilles, whom he
resembled in some notable respects, for he too was a son of a goddess who owned
divine armour that had been fashioned by Hephaistos. After killing many adver-
saries in battle, he speared Antilochos, son of Nestor, who sacriﬁced his own life to
rescue his father; for Nestor’s chariot had become immobilized after one of his horses
had been struck by an arrow shot by Paris, and he had appealed to his son to save
him from Memnon, who was plying his spear nearby. Now Antilochos was a close
friend of Achilles, indeed his very closest since the death of Patroklos; and just as
the great hero had avenged the death of Patroklos, he now set out to avenge the
death of Antilochos by killing Memnon. After Memnon was duly slain, his divine
mother appealed to Zeus to grant him immortality.177
According to local tradition, Memnon was buried in the Troad beside a stream called the
Asopos; in Quintus’ late epic, the dawn breezes are said to have joined together at the
bidding of Eos to carry his corpse to that spot.178 A legend reminiscent of that of the birds
of Diomedes (see p. 487) related that his Ethiopian comrades were transformed into some
remarkable birds, the Memnonides, who commemorated their master’s death on its anniver-
sary each year by ﬁghting a battle above his tomb.179 Or in Ovid’s version of the tale (which
is the earliest to survive although there is reason to suppose that the legend itself is quite
old), Zeus caused the birds to spring from the ashes on Memnon’s tomb in response to the
pleas of Eos, who begged him to soothe her distress by granting some exceptional honour
to her dead son.180 A late tradition suggests that the morning dew is formed from the tears
that Eos continues to shed for Memnon. These tales conﬂict with the earliest account in the
Aithiopis in which Zeus granted him immortality at his mother’s request.181
The death of Achilles and suicide of Aias
After killing Memnon, Achilles pursued the Trojans back across the plain and might
have forced his way into the city if he had not been shot in the ankle by Paris, or
by Apollo, or by both together. A late tradition suggested that he was invulnerable
except at the ankle (see p. 457). During the struggle that ensued for his body and
divine armour, Aias managed to hoist the corpse onto his shoulders, and then carried
it back to the Greek ships while Odysseus fought off the Trojans from behind.182
The Odyssey provides an account of his magniﬁcent funeral, reporting that he was
mourned for seventeen days and nights by his comrades and by Thetis too, along
with her Nereid sisters from beneath the sea and the nine Muses, who led the dirges.
After his body was consumed by the ﬂames of his funeral-pyre, his comrades gathered
— The Trojan War —
468

his remains and mixed them with those of Patroklos in a golden urn that had been
fashioned by Hephaistos; and they raised a huge burial-mound over their remains
and those of Antilochos, so that it was visible as a landmark from far out at sea.183
In the Homeric view, Achilles departed to the Underworld in the usual way,
where he would subsequently be encountered by Odysseus as a king among the
shades. In the Aithiopis, however, Thetis snatched him away from his funeral-pyre
and conveyed him to Leuke (the White Island), a posthumous home for favoured
heroes and heroines on the earth’s surface (much like Elysion, see p. 116);184 and
in the subsequent tradition, it was generally accepted that he was granted immor-
tality, either on Leuke (which came to be identiﬁed with an island in the Black Sea)
or in Elysion. He was often said to have contracted a posthumous marriage, usually
with Medeia or Helen, but sometimes with Iphigeneia or Polyxena.185
After the funeral of Achilles, splendid games were held in his honour, and his divine
arms and armour were offered as a prize to the Greek warrior who was adjudged to be
the bravest. According to the Odyssey, Thetis set up the contest, and it was judged 
by Athena and ‘the sons of the Trojans’ (i.e. the Trojan captives), who caused great 
anger to the Telamonian Aias by passing him over in favour of Odysseus.186 Or in the
curious version attested for the Little Iliad, a non-Homeric epic in the Trojan cycle,
some men were sent out to eavesdrop under the walls of Troy in accordance with a
suggestion from Nestor, and they heard two girls arguing about the relative merits of
Aias and Odysseus; when one asserted that Aias was the braver because he had carried
Achilles’ body from the battleﬁeld while Odysseus had been unwilling to do so, the
other retorted (at the inspiration of Athena, who specially favoured Odysseus) that
even a woman could carry such a load once it was on her shoulders, but she would not
have the nerve to ﬁght off the enemy (as Odysseus had done while he was covering

Aias’ retreat).187 In some later accounts, the Greek warriors decided the issue them-
selves through a ballot.188 By whatever process, Odysseus was selected to receive the
prize of honour, to the anger and astonishment of Aias, who was unable to believe
even for a moment that Odysseus might be the better man. To judge by the surviv-
ing literature, indeed, Aias really deserved to win the contest if sheer steadfastness and
courage were to be the criterion. In connection with his meeting with Aias in the
Underworld, where he saw him standing apart from all the other ghosts, still con-
sumed with anger at his defeat, Odysseus remarks in the Odyssey that he came to wish
that he had never won, and concedes that Aias was unsurpassed in his martial prowess
by any of the Greeks apart from Achilles himself.189
Aias committed suicide soon after he met with this humiliation in the contest for
the arms. Although the Homeric epics have nothing deﬁnite to say about his death,
except that it followed from his defeat,190 the surviving summary of the Little Iliad
states that he went mad after losing the contest, and destroyed the livestock of his
comrades and then killed himself. For the earliest full account of these events, we have
to rely on Sophocles’ Aias (although Pindar already notes that Aias killed himself by
falling on his sword in the dead of night). According to Sophocles, Aias had planned
— The Trojan War —
470

to avenge his ill-deserved defeat by attacking the Greek leaders while they were asleep
at night, but Athena frustrated his intent by sending him mad, and he therefore
killed their cattle and sheep instead. When he recovered his wits and discovered what
he had done, he was so ashamed that he resolved to commit suicide, ignoring the
pleas of his concubine Tekmessa.191 As the artistic evidence makes clear, it was agreed
from an early period that he ﬁxed his sword into the earth and fell on it; a tradition
suggested that he was vulnerable only at the point where the sword transﬁxed him,
at his chest or collar-bone, see p. 457. In the Little Iliad, Agamemnon refused him a
proper heroic funeral by cremation, ordering that he should be interred in a cofﬁn
instead;192 or in Sophocles’ version, Menelaos and Agamemnon proposed that his
corpse should be left in the open as prey for scavengers until Odysseus persuaded
Agamemnon to allow his burial.193 As his child by Tekmessa, Aias left a son called
Eurysakes (Broad Shield, so named after the towering shield of his father, see p. 456),
who now fell under the care of Aias’ half-brother Teukros.194
Preconditions for the fall of Troy; Philoktetes shoots Paris,
Neoptolemos kills Eurypylos, and Odysseus steals the Palladion
During the next stage of the conﬂict, the Greeks took three important steps to
advance the prospect of ﬁnal victory. They fetched their long-abandoned comrade
Philoktetes, who proceeded to kill Paris with the bow of Herakles; they fetched
Achilles’ young son Neoptolemos, who would make a crucial contribution to the
subsequent ﬁghting, helping to ﬁll the gap that had been left by the death of his
father; and Odysseus stole into Troy to steal its protective talisman, the Palladion
(an ancient image of Athena, see p. 523). These measures were revealed by a prophecy
(or prophecies) as actions that needed to be taken as preconditions for the fall of
the city. In the early epic account in the Little Iliad, Odysseus mounted an ambush
to capture HELENOS, a son of Priam who was a gifted seer; and Helenos revealed,
doubtless under pressure, that Philoktetes should be fetched from Lemnos (where
he had been marooned on account of a wound sustained during the outward journey,
see p. 449). After being healed of his wound by Machaon, son of Asklepios,
Philoktetes engaged in single combat with Paris and shot him dead. Menelaos, who
had ample reason to hate him, mutilated his corpse, but it was eventually recov-
ered by the Trojans for burial. The Greeks then took the two further actions
mentioned above, of fetching Neoptolemos and seizing the Palladion, quite possibly
as further measures that were advised by the captured Helenos (although nothing
is explicitly stated on the matter in the surviving testimonies in the Little Iliad).195
Apollodorus offers a rather different account of these events, in which Helenos
remained within the city until after the death of Paris, and it was the Greek seer
Kalchas who advised that Philoktetes should be fetched. This led to the death of
Paris as in the Little Iliad, and Helenos then competed with his brother Deiphobos
for the hand of Helen. Helenos was so aggrieved when she was awarded to his
brother that he left the city to live on Mt Ida; and it was at this stage that Odysseus
captured him, on the advice of Kalchas. Helenos now revealed further measures that
should be taken if Troy was to fall, namely that they should fetch Neoptolemos,
seize the Palladion and send for the bones of Pelops.196

— The Trojan War —
471

The latter condition for the fall of Troy is ﬁrst mentioned by Lycophron in the Hellenistic
period; the bones were said to have been buried at Letrina, near Olympia in Elis.197 It is
not clear why their presence should have affected the fate of Troy (although the Asiatic
origin of Pelops, see p. 502, may have something to do with the matter). According to a
tale recorded by Pausanias, a shoulder-bone alone was fetched, and it was subsequently lost
during the return voyage when the ship that was carrying it was wrecked in a great storm
off Euboea (evidently that sent by Athena, see p. 485). Many years later, a ﬁsherman from
the Euboean city of Eretrea caught the bone in his nets, and was so amazed by its size that
he travelled to Delphi to consult the oracle about it. Eleian envoys happened to be there at
the time, seeking a cure for a plague; and they were advised to restore the shoulder-bone
to its proper home, while the ﬁsherman was advised to hand it over to them. The Eleians
rewarded its ﬁnder (who was named Damarmenos) by appointing him and his descendants
to be the guardians of the bone.198
When Neoptolemos arrived in the Troad after being fetched by Odysseus from his
birthplace of Scyros (see p. 458), he took the lead in defeating the last major ally of
the Trojans, EURYPYLOS, son of Telephos. It is ﬁtting that his opponent in the last
heroic duel of the war should be the son of a hero who had tangled with his father
Achilles when the Greeks had ﬁrst set foot on Asian soil (see p. 446). According to
the early mythographer Acusilaus, who may have drawn this detail from the Little
Iliad, Eurypylos had been held back in his native Mysia by his mother Astyoche until
Priam had bribed her to change her mind by sending her a wonderful golden vine.199
It is reported elsewhere that this marvel had been fashioned by Hephaistos, and 
had been presented to one of Priam’s predecessors – either Tros or Laomedon – by
Zeus as compensation for the abduction of Ganymedes (see p. 522).200 Although 
the Odyssey mentions in passing that Eurypylos and his comrades met their death ‘on
account of a woman’s gifts’,201 we cannot be sure that Homer had the same story 
in mind. Some mythographers explained that Priam persuaded Eurypylos to come by
promising him one of his daughters as a wife.202 After arriving with a force of troops
from Mysia, which lay in an adjoining region of Asia Minor, he fought valiantly,
killing many Greeks, including Machaon, son of Asklepios, and the Boeotian leader
Peneleos (see p. 328); but he proved to be no match for Neoptolemos, who demon-
strated his heroic prowess by cutting him down in battle.203
After the death of Eurypylos, Odysseus entered Troy surreptitiously to steal the
city’s protective talisman. In the early epic account in the Little Iliad, he made two
secret incursions, ﬁrst entering the city in beggar’s disguise to spy out the ground,
and then returning with Diomedes to steal the Palladion. Although he was seen
and recognized by Helen during his ﬁrst incursion, she did not betray him but
engaged in a treacherous conversation instead, discussing plans for the taking of the
city; it would seem that she had become discontented with her predicament at
Troy.204 This encounter is already mentioned in the Iliad, in which Helen herself
tells Telemachos how she had recognized his father in the city, and had taken him
home and bathed him. After she had sworn not to betray him, he had revealed all
that the Greeks were intending. He had put many Trojans to the sword before
leaving, causing the women of the city to lament, but Helen had rejoiced in her
heart, for her thoughts had turned to her homeland and she now regretted that
Aphrodite had beguiled her into abandoning her husband and child.205 In
— The Trojan War —
472

Apollodorus’ account, Odysseus is said to have made only a single incursion. After
creeping up to the city by night with Diomedes, he disguised himself as a beggar
and made his way in while his comrade waited outside. Although he was recog-
nized by Helen, she helped in the theft of the Palladion, and he then took it back
to the Greek ships with the help of Diomedes.206 Some claimed that Odysseus and
Diomedes stole into the city through a sewer;207 and there is artistic evidence for
a version in which they seized the statue jointly.
In a version which portrays Odysseus in a very poor light, Diomedes climbed into Troy to
seize the Palladion, and Odysseus tried to kill him during the return journey to steal the
statue and the glory for himself; but as he was raising his sword to strike, Diomedes was
alerted by a glint of moonlight from the blade (or by the shadow of the blade), and forced
Odysseus to walk in front of him for the rest of the way. This story was cited in explana-
tion of the proverbial expression ‘Diomedeian compulsion’ (Diome¯deios ananke¯), a phrase which
is said to have originated in the Little Iliad. Although some such incident was presumably
described in the epic, the circumstances must have been rather different since the Palladion
had been stolen from Troy by Odysseus rather than Diomedes, in accordance with what
would become the standard account in the subsequent tradition.208
The stratagem of the Wooden Horse; the ruse of Sinon and 
fate of Laokoon
Finding that the city still seemed as impregnable as ever in spite of these various
measures, the Greeks adopted a new approach by attempting a ruse rather than
relying on the open use of force as hitherto. For at the suggestion of Athena (or of
that most ingenious of mortals Odysseus), they constructed a huge wooden horse with
a hollow interior to serve as a hiding-place for a concealed force of troops. A cleverly
disguised trap-door was set in its side to enable them to enter and leave. Epeios, son
of Panopeus, a hero from Phocis (see pp. 465–6), built it with the assistance of
Athena, using timber from the forests of Mt Ida. When the Horse was completed, a
picked band of troops was stationed inside under the command of Odysseus, and the
rest of the Greeks set ﬁre to their camp and sailed out to sea as if they had decided
to abandon the siege. Estimates of the number of the troops in the Horse vary from
twelve to ﬁfty or a hundred. They were intended to act as an advance guard who
would open the city gates to the main force if the Trojans dragged the Horse into the
city. The Greek ﬂeet was waiting off the coast at Tenedos in the mean time, watching
out for the ﬁre-signal that would call the ships back.209
On the morning after the Greeks had put their plan into effect, the Trojans saw
the Wooden Horse standing all alone on the deserted plain and went out to inves-
tigate. In the earliest account in the Odyssey, they dragged it into the city and then
argued about the best course of action, some proposing that they should break it
open, others that they should haul it to the top of a cliff and throw it over, and
others again that they should leave it where it was as an offering to the gods. They
ﬁnally sealed their own fate by deciding to adopt the latter course.210 It is reported
elsewhere that the Greeks encouraged the Trojans to regard the Horse as a sacred
object by marking it with an inscription which stated that it was a thank-offering
to Athena for their safe return.211 The story of the Wooden Horse was apparently

recounted in much the same way in two other epics in the Trojan cycle, the Little
Iliad and the Sack of Troy; in the former poem, the Trojans demolished part of the
city wall to allow for the entry of the huge object.212 Homer adds a peculiar detail
to the story, stating that Helen walked around the Horse calling out to the men
inside in perfect imitation of the voices of their wives; but although Menelaos and
Diomedes were tempted to respond, they were restrained by Odysseus, who also
placed his hand over the mouth of a certain Antiklos (who is otherwise unknown)
to prevent him from speaking aloud. Such is the strange tale recounted in the Odyssey
by Menelaos, who accounts for his wife’s caprice by saying that it must have been
inspired by some god who favoured the Trojans.213
When compared to these early accounts of the stratagem of the Horse, the versions
offered in the Aeneid and late Greek epic are signiﬁcantly different in two main
respects. In the ﬁrst place, the Trojans are far more suspicious of the Horse and
therefore argue about what they should do with it while it is still in its original
position; and second, the Greeks appreciate that the Trojans will be suspicious and
therefore arrange for SINON, a cousin of Odysseus, to be captured by them in
circumstances that will enable him to convince them that the Horse presents no
danger and should be taken into the city. Sinon already appears in early epic, but
only as the man who is left behind to light the beacon-signal to recall the Greek
ﬂeet at the appropriate moment. Instead of hiding himself, however, in these later
accounts, he ensures that he is found by the Trojans, and then sets out to win their
trust by leading them to believe that he is a deserter who has reason to hate his
fellow Greeks.
In Vergil’s narrative, the Trojans conduct a heated debate in front of the Horse
before Sinon appears on the scene, some arguing that they should haul it into the city,
while others urge that they should beware of any gift from the Greeks and should
therefore destroy it, or at least break it open to see whether anything is hidden inside.

The Wooden Horse. Drawing after an archaic vase.

Laokoon, a Trojan priest, takes the lead in advancing the latter view, and almost
proves his point by thrusting his spear into the side of the Horse, causing it to echo
within; but at that very moment, Sinon, who has been captured in accordance with
the Greek plan, is brought forward for questioning. He claims to have been on bad
terms with the other Greeks ever since he had vowed to avenge the unjust killing of
Palamedes (see p. 460), and alleges that Odysseus had plotted his destruction by
persuading the seer Kalchas to declare that he should be sacriﬁced to ensure the 
safe departure of the Greek ﬂeet; and as soon as the Trojans are convinced by his story
and are ready to believe that he hates his former comrades, they listen trustingly to
what he has to say about the Wooden Horse. He tells them that the Greeks built the
Horse on the advice of Kalchas to expiate for their sacrilege in having stolen Athena’s
cultic image, the Palladion; and if the Trojans should harm this sacred object, they
would be sure to suffer a terrible destruction, but they could expect a splendid destiny
on the other hand if they were to bring it into their city. So they resolve to do so,
and feel that their decision is conﬁrmed when Laokoon and his two sons are killed
shortly afterwards by two snakes which swim over from Tenedos; for they interpret
this as indicating that the gods are angry with him for having desecrated the sacred
object. When the Horse is inside the walls, the prophetess Kassandra adds her own
warnings, but to no effect since she is fated always to be disbelieved (see p. 154).
Sinon adopted hardier means to win the trust of the Trojans in the Greek epic of
Quintus of Smyrna, by keeping silent for a considerable time as they tortured him
and cut off his ears and nose, and so giving them cause to believe that they had forced
the truth out of him. Or in another late epic by Tryphiodorus, Sinon mutilates
himself to make his story seem more credible.214
Widely differing accounts are offered of the fate of LAOKOON and its signiﬁcance. In the
early epic version from the Sack of Troy, he met his death after the Trojans had brought the
Horse into their city. As they were feasting in the happy belief that the war had ended to their
advantage, two snakes appeared and destroyed Laokoon along with one of his two sons; and
Aineias and his followers regarded this as a portent and withdrew to Mt Ida outside the
city.215 The meaning of the sign is not hard to make out: the death of Laokoon indicates 
the impending fall of the city, while the death of his son (evidently the eldest although this
is not stated in the surviving summary) points to the destruction of Priam’s senior branch of
the ruling family. So by withdrawing, Aineias, as the main representative of the junior branch,
will survive to take over. In Vergil’s account by contrast, the snakes seem to act by divine 
will to ensure that Laokoon’s warnings about the Horse will be discounted; in Quintus’ epic,
in which the episode serves a similar function, it is explicitly stated that Athena sent the
snakes with this intent (after ﬁrst making Laokoon blind). Both of Laokoon’s sons are killed
in these accounts.216 According to Apollodorus, the snakes were sent by Apollo ‘as a sign’
when the Horse was already in the city; they swam over the sea from some neighbouring
islands and devoured the sons of Laokoon. This accords with a poorly attested version from
Sophocles in which the sons alone were killed (a matter of uncertain signiﬁcance). Since the
relevant section of Apollodorus’ text is preserved only in summary form, it is not clear what
Apollo was trying to indicate, or whether anyone took any action as a result; in Sophocles’
version, Aineias’ father interpreted the episode as a sign, and Aineias was therefore encour-
aged to leave the city before its fall, much as in early epic.217 The snakes were usually said to
have come from some islands of uncertain identity, the Kalydnai; Bacchylides already said as
much, adding rather unexpectedly that they turned into human form on their arrival.218

In versions of a wholly different kind ﬁrst recorded in Roman mythographical sources,
the snakes were sent by Apollo to punish Laokoon for behaving in a manner inappropriate
to a priest, whether by having intercourse with his wife in front of the divine images in the
precinct of Apollo, or by marrying and fathering children against the will of Apollo.219
Although Laokoon was primarily the priest of Thymbraian Apollo, some authors, including
Vergil and the Hellenistic poet Euphorion, state that he was chosen by lot to become the
priest of Poseidon at some stage (for the original priest had been stoned to death by the
Trojans for failing to offer the proper sacriﬁces to avert the Greek landing).220 For what it
is worth, Laokoon is described in late sources as a son of Aineias’ grandfather Kapys or of
the Trojan elder Antenor.221
The sack of Troy
In the depth of the night, while the Trojans were asleep after celebrating their
apparent victory, the Greeks put their plan into effect. Sinon lit a beacon-ﬁre in the
city (or on the tomb of Achilles by the shore) to recall the ﬂeet from Tenedos and
guide it on its way;222 and the warriors who had been waiting inside the Wooden
Horse opened the trap-door and slipped down to the ground on ladders or a rope.223
Or in Vergil’s account, which portrays the events of the night through Aineias’ eyes
and often departs from the early epic tradition, Helen recalled the ﬂeet by raising
a torch from the citadel; and as the ﬂeet was sailing over from Tenedos, a ﬁre-signal
was lit on the king’s ship as a cue to Sinon, who then removed some planks from
the Wooden Horse to release the warriors from their conﬁnement.224 Whatever the
exact course of the preceding events, the warriors from the Horse killed the sentries
and anyone who might have raised the alarm, and then opened the city gates to
admit the main force (if this was necessary, for in some accounts, as mentioned
above, the walls had already been breached by the Trojans to allow for the entry of
the Horse). All the Greek troops were now able to join together to slaughter the
unsuspecting Trojans.
No full early account has survived of the course of events on the night of the
sack, even if continuous narratives from a later period can be found in book 2 of
the Aeneid and book 13 of Quintus’ Posthomerica. We will concentrate on the fates
of the most prominent Trojans, as these would have been presented in the early epic
tradition in particular. Pausanias’ description of Polygnotos’ great mural of the sack
of Troy, which was painted in the mid-ﬁfth century BC, may be consulted for further
information on how prominent individuals from both sides would have fared on that
night in early accounts.225
In the standard account from the Sack of Troy in the epic cycle, Neoptolemos
forced his way into the palace and killed Priam with his lance as the king was
seeking sanctuary at the altar of Zeus Herkeios in the central courtyard.226 The Little
Iliad presented the episode somewhat differently, suggesting that Neoptolemos
dragged him away from the altar and killed him at the doorway of the palace.227
There are also later accounts in which the young hero decapitated him or hauled
him out of the city to slaughter him on the grave of Achilles;228 and in Vergil’s
portrayal, he killed a surviving son of his, Polites, in front of him before putting
him to the sword.229 Menelaos made for the house of Deiphobos to recover his
errant wife Helen. According to the Odyssey, he was accompanied by Odysseus, who
— The Trojan War —
476

became engaged in a desperate ﬁght there but won in the end with the help of
Athena; but our summary of the Sack of Troy makes no mention of Odysseus in this
connection, merely stating that Menelaos found Helen and took her back to the
ship after killing Deiphobos.230 In the Little Iliad, he had apparently planned to kill
her, but cast his sword away after catching a glimpse of naked breasts; or in another
version, the sight of her divine beauty deterred the Greek troops from stoning her
as they had planned, or from putting her to the sword.231 In the Aeneid, Aineias
saw her hiding in the temple of Hestia (Vesta in Latin form) and would have killed
her if his divine mother Aphrodite (Venus), who was also Helen’s protectress, had
not prevented him.232 Theseus’ mother Aithra, who had been obliged to attend
Helen as a maidservant (see p. 361), was discovered among the captives after the
sack by Demophon and Akamas, the two sons of Theseus, who were allowed to take
her away after Agamemnon had gained Helen’s consent (see also on p. 375).233
Andromache, the widow of Hektor, was seized by Neoptolemos along with her
infant son Astyanax. Some surviving lines from the Little Iliad describe how
Neoptolemos took her down to the Greek ships, but snatched the young Astyanax
from his nurse, and then grasped him by the feet and ﬂung him down from a tower.
In the Sack of Troy, by contrast, Odysseus caused his death by hurling him from
the city walls;234 or in some later accounts, the Greeks, with some encouragement
from Odysseus, resolved at a meeting after the fall of the city that Astyanax should
be put to death.235 Vase-painters often depict his murder in conjunction with that
of Priam. This was a rational if ruthless measure since it eliminated the only member
of the Trojan royal family who might be likely to seek revenge in the future.
Andromache was assigned to Neoptolemos after the sack and accompanied him to
Epirus as his concubine (see p. 489).
Hekabe, the wife of Priam, was seized and taken down to the ships, as were her
daughters; of these, only Kassandra has a notable story associated with her capture.

Figure 13.9
Return of Helen to Menelaos. Red-ﬁgure skyphos, Boston MFA 13. 186.

According to the Sack of Troy in the epic cycle, she claimed sanctuary by clinging
to a cultic image of Athena, but the lesser Aias dragged her away by force, pulling
the statue from its position as he did so. His fellow warriors were so appalled by
his behaviour that they would have stoned him if he had not taken refuge at the
altar of Athena, presumably in the very same temple where he had committed his
act of sacrilege.236 Athena exacted a terrible vengeance as we will see (pp. 482ff),
causing the death not only of Aias but of many of his comrades too as they were
sailing home to Greece; these events were described in the next epic in the Trojan
cycle, the Returns. Later authors heightened the story of Aias’ sacrilege by saying
that he raped Kassandra under the statue of the goddess. It is quite possible that
this was already stated by Alcaeus (born in the latter part of seventh century BC)
but the relevant verb is unfortunately missing from the papyrus.237 The evidence
from the visual arts would suggest in any case that the story was familiar by the
sixth century. The ﬁrst author to speak unequivocally of a rape is Lycophron, who
adds that the statue raised its eyes upward in disgust.238
Something must now be said about the main survivors among the Trojan men.
Of the sons of Priam, Helenos was already in the Greek camp, having betrayed
preconditions for the fall of Troy under a greater or lesser degree of compulsion (see
p. 471); he would accompany Neoptolemos to Epirus after the war (see p. 490). In
the post-epic tradition at least, Priam had sent his youngest son Polydoros abroad
in the hope of ensuring his safety, but to no effect since he was murdered by his
host (see below). Aineias, who belonged to another branch of the family, escaped
during the turmoil with his aged father Anchises on his back (see p. 585), if he
had not already withdrawn from the city shortly before (see p. 475). The Trojan
nobleman Antenor was spared along with his family because he had supported the
Greek ambassadors when they had proposed a peaceful settlement at the outbreak
of the war (see p. 454).
The fate of the Trojan women
After massacring the men of military age, as was the usual practice after the forcible
seizure of a city, the Greeks put Troy (or what remained of it) to the torch and
went down to their camp by the ships to share out the spoils. The story now focuses
on the sad fate of the captive women, in particular those who belonged to the imme-
diate family of Priam.239 Hekabe (Hecuba), the main wife of Priam, stands out
prominently in all versions of the Troy-saga as a majestic but most unhappy ﬁgure
who was fated to see her sons killed one after another, and her husband cut down
in the courtyard of his own palace. Nothing is known of how she fared after the
fall of the city in early epic; although it is commonly stated in the later tradition
that she was allotted to Odysseus, there is no indication of that in the Odyssey or in
the surviving testimonies on the Sack of Troy. She was usually said to have died soon
afterwards, and in most remarkable circumstances too, for she was transformed into
a dog by the shores of the Hellespont (or as she was being carried over its waters
in a ship), met a swift death thereafter, and was buried at Kynossema (Bitch’s 
Grave) near the entrance to the Hellespont on its European shore.240 In Euripides’
— The Trojan War —
478

Hecuba, which is the earliest securely datable source for the transformation, it is fore-
told that Hekabe will never reach Greece, for she will change into a ﬁery-eyed dog
on the ship that will carry her away, and then climb up its mast and fall to her
death in the sea, to be buried at Kynossema.241 It is clear from the allusive manner
in which Hekabe’s fate is described that this must already have been a familiar tale.
In subsequent accounts, Hekabe is said to have been transformed after leaping into
the sea in her anguish at the fate of her homeland,242 or as she was being stoned
by the Greeks in response to curses that she had uttered against them243 (or by the
Thracians because she had blinded their king Polymestor,244 see below). Some said
that she became a ghost-hound that disturbed the lands around the Hellespont with
its howling, or that she became the hound of Hekate.245 In some rationalized
accounts, by contrast, she was simply stoned like a dog without undergoing a trans-
formation.246 The early lyric poet Stesichorus offers an exceptional account of her
fate by stating that Apollo transferred her to Lycia after the war.247
In Euripides’ Hecuba, Odysseus is said to have taken Hekabe across the Hellespont to the
Thracian Chersonnese, where her attendants discovered the body of her young son POLY-
DOROS on the shore.248 This Polydoros, who was her last-born son, had been entrusted to
POLYMESTOR, king of Thrace, by Priam, who had also given Polymestor a quantity of gold
to ensure the continuance of his line if Troy should fall;249 so Hekabe realized that Polymestor
must have killed her son to steal the gold for himself. With the permission of Agamemnon,
she invited Polymestor and his sons to visit her, and induced them to enter her tent without
protection by promising to reveal where the ancestral treasures of Priam had been hidden; and
she then blinded Polymestor and murdered his sons with the assistance of her women.250 At
the end of the play, Polymestor discloses the above-mentioned prophecy about Hekabe’s fate,
and Agamemnon orders that their blinded king should be marooned on a desert island. Both
in this play and in his Trojan Women, Euripides paints a poignant picture of the aftermath of
the fall of Troy and of the predicament of the female captives.
The daughters of Priam and Hekabe met with varying fates. Their prophetic
daughter Kassandra, who had already suffered at the hands of the lesser Aias during
the night of the sack, was awarded to Agamemnon as a war-prize and subsequently
murdered in Argos by his wife Klytaimnestra (see p. 508).251 According to a story
that was already recounted in the Sack of Troy, Polyxena was slaughtered on the
grave of Achilles. Later sources explain that the ghost of Achilles demanded that
she should be offered to him as his share of the spoils (or as his bride in death),
and state that the sacriﬁce was performed by the hero’s son, Neoptolemos. Although
Sophocles’ play on the matter, the Polyxena, has been lost, a full surviving account
of this disturbing episode may be found in the ﬁrst part of Euripides’ Hecuba. The
idea that the sacriﬁce was a sort of forced marriage ﬁrst appears in the Hellenistic
period, in Lycophron. Seneca states more explicitly that Achilles wanted Polyxena
as his posthumous wife in the Elysian Fields.252
Revisionist mythographers have much to say about Polyxena. Philostratus suggests that she
accompanied Priam when he visited the Greek camp to seek the return of Hektor’s body,
and fell in love with Achilles at that time; and after his death, she stole out of the city and
stabbed herself on his grave so as to become his posthumous bride.253 Or in accounts from

Latin sources, Achilles saw her during a pause in the ﬁghting and incurred his own death
by seeking to marry her, for Paris and Deiphobos took advantage of the negotiations to
murder him in the shrine of Thymbraian Apollo just outside the city.254
Although it is not clear why the Cypria should have had anything to say about the matter,
it apparently offered an account of Polyxena’s fate that differed from that in the Sack of Troy,
stating that she was fatally wounded by Odysseus and Diomedes during the capture of the
city and was buried by Neoptolemos afterwards.255
According to a tale ﬁrst reported by Lycophron, another daughter of Priam, Laodike,
was swallowed up in a chasm in the earth near the tomb of her ancestor Ilos. Quintus
explains in his late epic that she prayed to the gods to meet with this fate so as to
be spared the indignity of enslavement.256 The Iliad refers to her as the most beau-
tiful of the daughters of Priam, and mentions that she was married to Helikaon,
son of Antenor. It is quite possible that her connection with the family of Antenor
saved her from enslavement in early epic, especially since Odysseus saved her husband
during the sack in the Little Iliad.257 For a Hellenistic love-story that claimed that
she had previously borne a son to Akamas, son of Theseus, see p. 376. In all but
the earliest traditions, Aineias was said to have been married to Kreousa, daughter
of Priam. Polygnotos portrayed her among the Trojan captives in his painting of
the sack,258 while subsequent literary accounts disagree on whether she escaped with
her husband or was left behind. In the best-known version in the Aeneid, Aineias
was distressed to ﬁnd that she had become separated from him as they were ﬂeeing
from the burning city, and went back to look for her; but her ghost appeared to
him to tell him that she had been held back by the Mother of the Gods, and that
it was the will of the gods that he should travel abroad without her.259 Or according
to Lycophron, the Greeks allowed him to depart and to select something to take
with him, and he chose to take his father and household gods rather than his wife,
children and property; or else he escaped during the sack with his wife and chil-
dren too.260

THE RETURNS OF THE 
GREEKS AND THE HISTORY 
OF THE PELOPIDS

THE RETURN JOURNEYS OF THE GREEKS
T
he stories of the return journeys (nostoi) of the Greeks were recounted in a special
epic in the Trojan cycle, the Nostoi or ‘Returns’. A central theme of this epic
was the wrath of Athena, which was provoked by an act of sacrilege committed at
her shrine by the lesser Aias during the sack of Troy (see pp. 477–8), and was
directed not only against him but also against the Greeks in general for having
failed to punish him. The goddess sowed discord in the Greek camp, causing
Agamemnon and Menelaos to quarrel and so return home separately with different
sections of the army; and she then sent a fearsome storm against Agamemnon’s
section of the ﬂeet. Some heroes were driven far off course, some were killed, while
a few avoided the perils of the sea altogether by travelling away by land. The varying
itineraries and fates of the returning Greeks will form the subject of the ﬁrst half
of the present chapter. Four heroes in particular have interesting stories associated
with their returns. Odysseus wandered far abroad into strange realms and distant
seas, as recounted in the second of the Homeric epics, while Neoptolemos, the son
of the dead Achilles, travelled overland on the advice of his divine grandmother and
settled in Epirus, on the north-western fringes of Greece, with Hektor’s widow as
his concubine and Helen’s daughter as his wife. Agamemnon for his part made a
safe sea-crossing but was murdered by his wife (or her lover) on arriving home in
Argos, while his brother Menelaos delayed for several years in Egypt after being
driven out far off course by a storm, and therefore did not set foot in the Peloponnese
until after Agamemnon’s murder had been avenged by his son Orestes. As it happens,
this cycle of intrafamilial conﬂict and vengeance was nothing exceptional in the
history of Agamemnon’s family, the Pelopids. Since the main myths of the Pelopids
fall equally on either side of the Trojan War, we will devote the second half of the
chapter to the bloody history of the family, tracing its earlier history before returning
to consider the murder of Agamemnon and all that followed from it.

CHAPTER FOURTEEN
481

Athena’s wrath at the sacrilege of the lesser Aias, and its
implications for the Greek returns
Of all the deeds that were committed by the Greeks during the sack of Troy, none
was considered more shameful than the lesser Aias’ act of sacrilege in seizing
Kassandra from her place of sanctuary in the temple of Athena, and even raping her
by the altar in some accounts. In the earliest recorded version, from the Sack of Troy
in the epic cycle, he dragged her away as she was trying to cling to the cultic image
of the goddess, and his fellow Greeks were so appalled by his behaviour that they
would have stoned him if he had not taken refuge at the altar of Athena (appar-
ently the one that he had violated!). The summary of this lost epic concludes with
the ominous statement that the goddess planned to bring disaster to the Greeks on
the high seas, presumably because they had failed to avenge the sacrilege.1 The
resulting theme of the wrath of Athena is already in evidence in Nestor’s account
of the Greek returns in the Odyssey, and it was central to the plot of the Returns as
has been noted. As it happens, neither the Odyssey nor the surviving testimonies on
the Returns make any explicit mention of the cause of the goddess’s anger, but it
can be assumed that Aias’ sacrilege was to blame, as was certainly indicated in the
Sack of Troy and commonly accepted in the subsequent tradition.
The returns of the Greeks were disrupted in a number of ways as a direct or indi-
rect result of the goddess’ rancour. Even before the Greek force was ready to depart,
she incited its two main leaders to quarrel over the best course of action, Agamemnon
arguing that they should delay their departure until they had taken measures to
appease the goddess, while his brother Menelaos urged that they should depart
immediately. The ﬂeet was divided as a consequence, for Menelaos and those who
shared his opinion, including Nestor and Diomedes, set off in advance of
Agamemnon and the rest of the army. When Agamemnon subsequently led the
others out to sea after offering sacriﬁces to Athena, he soon had reason to suppose
that the mind of the goddess had not yet been softened, for the ﬂeet was struck by
a violent storm in which the lesser Aias, who had caused the trouble in the ﬁrst
place, met a well-deserved death. Agamemnon escaped, however, and arrived home
safely, as did Nestor and Diomedes after setting off previously with Menelaos. Special
fates were reserved for Menelaos and Odysseus, whose returns were delayed for a
number of years as they wandered in foreign parts.
Thus far the Returns was in agreement with the Odyssey, but it went beyond the
earlier epic by offering an account of two overland journeys, the ﬁrst within Asia
Minor by the seer Kalchas and some companions, and the second by Neoptolemos,
who travelled by land to northern Greece with Helenos and others. The Odyssey
makes no mention of the former journey, and makes only a brief reference to the
travels of Neoptolemos, saying that he arrived back safely with the Myrmidons,
presumably after making a sea-crossing to his father’s land in Thessaly (although
this is not explicitly stated). His divine grandmother Thetis advised him to travel
overland in the Returns, evidently because she was aware that the ﬂeet would be
endangered as a result of Athena’s anger.2

Menelaos and Agamemnon quarrel at the incitation of Athena, 
and depart separately with different sections of the army
Since little is recorded of the Returns beyond a brief outline of its plot, we will
begin by examining in further detail what Nestor and Menelaos have to say about
the returns of the Greeks in the Odyssey, and then consider how the story of the
great storm was developed in the subsequent tradition. When Telemachos, the son
of Odysseus, visits Nestor and Menelaos in the Odyssey to seek news of his long-
absent father, they have much of interest to say about their own return voyages and
the fate of their comrades. Nestor tells him that Zeus had planned a dismal return
for the Greeks because not all of them had behaved wisely or righteously (presum-
ably during the sack of the city), and many of them had come to grief accordingly
through the wrath of Athena. The goddess had started the mischief by inciting
Agamemnon and Menelaos to quarrel immediately after the fall of Troy. The two
leaders summoned a meeting of the troops to put forward their opposing views,
Menelaos arguing that they should make an immediate departure, and Agamemnon
that they should delay until they had offered splendid sacriﬁces to Athena (little
realizing that she would not be appeased by them, for the mind of a god is not
turned in a moment). The meeting was an ill-ordered and ill-tempered affair, held
at sunset when the troops were befuddled with wine; and no common decision was
reached at it since neither brother was able to convince more than part of the audi-
ence. So Menelaos sailed away on the following morning with half of the Greek
force while the other troops remained behind with Agamemnon.3
Soon after their departure, Menelaos and those who had sailed with him stopped
off at the island of Tenedos to offer sacriﬁces for their safe return. Further dissen-
sion arose at this point, and some followed the lead of Odysseus by turning their
ships around and heading back towards Troy. Nothing more is revealed about the
progress of this group of ships until we learn from Odysseus’ own narrative later in
the epic that he was blown to Thrace with twelve ships (see p. 492). Nestor and
Diomedes headed for home in accordance with the original plan, initially sailing
south down the Asian coast; and they were closely followed by Menelaos, who caught
up with them at Lesbos. They then sailed directly across the Aegean to Euboea,
stopping off at its southern tip to offer sacriﬁces to Poseidon for their safe passage.
Diomedes arrived home safely in Argos on the fourth day of the voyage, while Nestor
continued on his way around the southern tip of the Peloponnese, beneﬁting from
favourable winds until he reached his city of Pylos on the west coast.4
Menelaos is driven to Egypt and remains in the area 
for eight years
Menelaos parted from the others soon after leaving Euboea, for his steersman Phrontis
suddenly died as the ﬂeet was approaching the southern tip of Attica, and he was
therefore obliged to call in at the coast to bury him. When he resumed the voyage,
he was struck by a violent storm off Cape Malea at the south-eastern corner of the
Peloponnese, and his squadron of ships was split into two. Although some of his
ships were wrecked on Crete, Menelaos himself was driven all the way to Egypt

with the fﬁve surviving ships, and remained in that region for eight years, amassing
quantities of treasure.5 As he recounts to Telemachos in the Odyssey, he had a curious
adventure when he ﬁnally decided to sail home to Sparta. As he was trying to set
out to sea, he was becalmed for twenty days at Pharos, a small island off the Nile
delta, until he and his men ran out of supplies and were reduced to catching ﬁsh,
the very last resort for a Greek warrior. In the end, however, the sea-nymph Eidothea
took pity on him and told him to lie in wait for her father Proteus, the old man
of the sea, who would be able to provide the advice that he needed. She guided
him and three of his companions to the cave in which Proteus used to take his
noon-tide siesta among his herds of seals; and she disguised them by wrapping them
in freshly cut seal-skins, placing a dab of ambrosia under their noses to counteract
the vile stench. They were thus able to catch Proteus by surprise, and they kept a
ﬁrm grip on him even though he tried to escape by constantly changing his shape,
turning ﬁrst into a lion and then into a snake, a leopard, a boar, and running water
and a towering tree. When ﬁnally compelled to speak, he revealed that Menelaos
and his followers had been held back because they had failed to offer the proper
sacriﬁces to Zeus and the other gods before setting out to sea, and recommended
that they should return to the Nile to rectify the omission. He was also able to tell
Menelaos about the fates of Agamemnon, Aias and Odysseus, as we will see shortly.
On receiving the offerings that were due to them, the gods granted a fair wind to
Menelaos to carry him swiftly home; and he arrived to learn that the murder of
Agamemnon had just been avenged by his son Orestes.6
Although we are told that Menelaos lingered in foreign parts for almost as long
as Odysseus, wandering through Cyprus and Phoenicia and visiting the Ethiopians
and Libyans and other peoples of strange speech, Homer has no speciﬁc adventures
to report for him until the time of his departure; these long years are essentially a
blank.7 The tale of his wanderings was evidently invented (quite possibly by Homer
himself) for a single purpose, to keep him out of the way until the cycle of vengeance
had been completed within his brother’s family; for it would otherwise have been
hard to explain why Menelaos himself should have failed to take any action over
the murder of his brother and the usurpation of the Mycenaean throne.
It hardly needs saying that Menelaos was accompanied on his travels by Helen, his newly
recovered wife. The Odyssey refers to various gifts that were received by her during her stay 
in Egypt, notably some wonder-working drugs and a silver work-basket that ran on wheels.8
As has been mentioned (see p. 445), there were unorthodox versions of her legend in which
she remained in Egypt during the war while a phantom of her accompanied Paris to Troy; 
in that case, Menelaos was reunited with the true Helen when he visited Egypt after the 
war, recovering her from Proteus, king of Egypt, or from his violent son and successor
Theoklymenos.9
According to a Hellenistic legend, the helmsman of Menelaos during the voyage to Egypt
was a certain KANOPOS (or Kanobos), who was appointed to this post after the death of
Phrontis (see above); he was the eponym of the city of the same name at the Kanopic mouth
of the Nile. While he was in Egypt, Theonoe, the daughter of the king, conceived an un-
requited passion for him; and when he died from a snake-bite at the mouth of the Nile as
he and his comrades were preparing to sail home, Menelaos and Helen had him buried at
— The returns of the Greeks —
484

the site of the city that bore his name.10 The name Kanopos was also conferred on a brilliant
star in the southern sky (alpha Carinae), which was not visible from the Greek mainland
but would rise above the horizon as ships sailed south to Egypt; there was apparently an
astral myth in which Kanopos was raised to the sky to become this star after his death.11
Agamemnon’s section of the ﬂeet is struck by a great storm; the
death of the lesser Aias; Nauplios the wrecker
Although Menelaos and Nestor could obviously have had no direct knowledge of
how Agamemnon’s section of the ﬂeet had fared at sea, Menelaos was able to report
the essentials to Telemachos because he had questioned Proteus about the matter.
The old man of the sea, who was something of a seer like other sea-gods of his
kind, had declared that only two of the Greek chieftains had perished since leaving
Troy, the lesser Aias out at sea and Agamemnon in his homeland; for Aias had been
shipwrecked and killed by Poseidon, and Agamemnon had been murdered as soon
as he had arrived in the Argolid. With regard to Aias, Proteus had explained that
Poseidon had driven him on to the Gyraian Rocks (of uncertain location, see below),
but had saved him from the sea afterwards; he would therefore have survived if he
had not foolishly boasted that he had escaped against the will of the gods, gravely
angering Poseidon, who had reached for his trident and had split the rock on which
he was standing, causing him to be thrown into the sea and drowned.12 As for
Agamemnon, he had escaped the dangers of the sea through the protection of Hera,
but had been murdered by his wife’s lover, Aigisthos, after setting foot on his native
soil.13 Proteus also revealed that Odysseus was still alive, even though he had lost
all his companions, and was detained for the present on the island of Kalypso (see
p. 497).14 Nestor for his part was able to inform Telemachos that he had heard
news of the safe returns of Neoptolemos, Philoktetes and Idomoneus (all of whom
had apparently sailed with Agamemnon).15
It is not clear from the Odyssey whether all the Greeks who had sailed off with
Agamemnon were imperilled by a great storm, as was certainly the case in the 
Returns. In the latter epic, the ghost of Achilles appeared to Agamemnon and the
others as they were sailing away from Troy, and tried to hold the ﬂeet back by fore-
telling what would befall them (evidently a storm that would be sent against them
as a result of the anger of Athena). The storm descended on them at the Kapherides
Rocks, causing the death of the lesser Aias. This bare outline is all that is recorded
in the surviving summary of the poem.16 The rocks were located at Cape Kaphareus
at the southern tip of Euboea (the long island that skirts the east coast of Central
Greece). According to subsequent sources, the seafarer Nauplios, who had been
embittered against the Greeks ever since his son Palamedes had been unjustly killed
at Troy (see pp. 459–60), took advantage of the storm to lure many ships to their
destruction. He achieved this by lighting beacon-ﬁres on the headland, causing the
sailors to steer towards them in the belief that they were being guided to a safe haven,
and so run ashore on the rocks. Cape Kaphareus was notorious as a hazard to ship-
ping in any case, as is witnessed in its later name of Xylophagos, ‘Eater of Timber’.17

to have referred to Nauplios’ activities as a wrecker, it is at least possible that he
already ﬁgured in that role in the Returns, since the epic is known to have referred 
to him in some context, and it located the storm at the appropriate place.18
The location of the Gyraian Rocks, where the lesser Aias is said to have met his
death in the Odyssey,19 was disputed in later tradition, for some authors placed them
at Cape Kaphareus in Euboea while others claimed that they lay further south in
one of the smaller islands, either Mykonos or Tenos. Later accounts of the progress
of the storm and destruction vary accordingly, since Aias would have been killed
in the course of the general disaster if he died off Euboea, but must have been killed
before or after the mass of the ﬂeet was most gravely imperilled if he died further
south among the smaller Aegean islands. Hyginus brings all the events together,
stating that the gods sent a storm against the Greeks at the Kapharean Rocks because
they had despoiled the shrines of the gods, and that Aias was struck dead there by
Athena in the course of the storm.20 Apollodorus recounts on the other hand that
Zeus sent the storm at the request of Athena while the ﬂeet was off Tenos in the
southern Aegean; and although Aias perished at that point after his ship was
destroyed by a thunderbolt, the rest of the ﬂeet was driven on towards Euboea,
where many ships were lured on to Cape Kaphareus by a false beacon kindled by
Nauplios.21 There were also versions that reversed this order of events by stating
that the storm struck the ﬂeet off Euboea, causing the usual destruction, while Aias
was killed somewhat later after being driven southward to the islands.22
Athena was often said to have hurled a thunderbolt at Aias or his ship, or at the Greek
ships in general, even though this was not a customary weapon of hers; she borrowed it for
the speciﬁc purpose from her father Zeus.23 According to Apollodorus, Aias escaped on to
a rock after his ship was shattered by the thunderbolt, but proceeded to boast about his
good fortune (much as in the Odyssey), saying that he had survived against the will of Athena.
Poseidon was so angered by his presumption that he split the rock with his trident, causing
him to be propelled into the sea and drowned; and his body was cast ashore on Mykonos,
where it was discovered and buried by Thetis.24 Or in a slightly different account, it was
washed ashore and buried by the goddess on the neighbouring island of Delos (which was
normally too holy for human burials).25 The malevolent activities of Nauplios ﬁgure in most
narratives; Hyginus even suggests that he killed the survivors who managed to swim to the
shore.26 Awkward though this subject may seem for a dramatist, Sophocles portrayed the
revenge of Nauplios in a lost play called Nauplios the Fire-Kindler (Nauplios Pyrkaios).
Even though many ships were supposed to have been wrecked as a result of the
storm and also (in the post-epic tradition at least) of the treachery of Nauplios, the
victims are anonymous almost without exception. The only hero of any signiﬁcance
to be named as having been killed off Euboea is Meges, son of Phyleus, a grandson
of Augeias who led the men of Doulichion and the Echinadian Islands to Troy. In
addition to Meges, who makes a few minor appearances in the Iliad, two lesser
victims are sometimes cited from among the leaders who are listed in the second
book of the epic, namely Gouneus from Epirus and Prothoos from Magnesia
(although they both settled in Libya in another account).27 It would seem that the
myth of the great storm was elaborated at a relatively late period when it was already
ﬁrmly established that most of the major heroes had arrived home safely.
— The returns of the Greeks —
486

In the early epic tradition, the returning heroes would doubtless have resumed their normal
lives after arriving home from the war; with the exception of Odysseus and Menelaos, indeed,
none of the chieftains were even said to have been driven far off course on the way. There
are nevertheless many aetiological legends of younger origin in which greater and lesser
heroes alike are said to have gone abroad to found new cities in distant parts, either because
they were blown off course while trying to sail home or because they met with trouble on
arriving home. Although any detailed consideration of mythology of this kind would take
us far out of our way, it may be worthwhile to consider by way of example how Diomedes
and Philoktetes, two notable heroes who are stated to have made a safe return in the Odyssey,28
came to end up in Italy in Hellenistic and later accounts.
To explain why Diomedes should have met with trouble when he arrived home in Argos,
some authors added an epilogue to the well-known story in the Iliad in which he is said to
have wounded Aphrodite in battle at Troy (see p. 461);29 for it was suggested that the goddess
of love exacted revenge on him by inciting his wife Aigialeia to commit adultery with other
men, and ﬁnally to desert him for Kometes, son of Sthenelos (a minor member of the Argive
royal family, see p. 334). The guilty couple tried to kill Diomedes on his return, much as in
the more ancient myth of Agamemnon and Klytaimnestra; but he escaped by taking sanc-
tuary at the altar of Athena (or Hera) and then ﬂeeing abroad to Italy.30 In another version of
the story, the embittered Nauplios sailed to Argos to turn Aigialeia against her husband. He
was sometimes said to have also incited the inﬁdelity of Klytaimnestra and to have persuaded
the wife of Idomeneus to take a lover; the surviving sources fail to explain how he set about
this delicate task.31
When Diomedes arrived in Apulia in south-east Italy, the local ruler Daunus (Daunos or
Daunios in Greek) offered him his daughter and a share of the kingdom if he would help him
in a war against the neighbouring Messapians (Calabrians).32 Various towns were said to have
been founded in the region by Diomedes thereafter, including Canusium, Sipontum and
Argyripa (Arpi, supposedly called Argos Hippion, i.e. Argos of the Horses, at the time of 
its founding).33 He offers some personal reﬂections on his past experiences in the Aeneid
when some Italian envoys visit him at Argyripa in the vain hope of enlisting his support
against Aeneas.34 The most memorable feature of his Italian legend is the lore associated with
the birds of Diomedes. The island of Diomedeia off the Apulian coast, where the hero was
supposedly buried, was said to be inhabited by some remarkable birds which were friendly to
Greek visitors but would attack any foreigner who set foot on the island; they tended the tomb
of Diomedes, furthermore, by sprinkling it with fresh water every day. Although it was 
agreed that these birds were the transformed companions of Diomedes (or the descendants of
them), divergent accounts were offered of the circumstances of their transformation. In a
Hellenistic version recorded by Antoninus (probably from Nicander), they were transformed
at the will of Zeus, who took pity on them after they were murdered by some Illyrians who
coveted their land. This would explain why they were so hostile to foreigners.35 Or in some
Latin accounts, the transformation was a punishment imposed by Aphrodite, either because
their leader had wounded her long ago or because some of them had abused her for having
persecuted him afterwards.36 Or else they were transformed, presumably by some god in 
pity, after they were shipwrecked on the island and Diomedes was treacherously killed there
by Aineias.37 Or they were transformed by Athena after Diomedes was treacherously killed by
Daunus or a son of his.38
The great archer Philoktetes also acquired an Italian legend. Although Sophocles still indi-
cates a happy return for him in the Philoktetes,39 which was ﬁrst performed in 409 BC, he is
said to have been diverted to lower Italy in subsequent sources, either because he was blown
off course during his return voyage or because he was greeted with a revolt when he arrived
home in southern Thessaly.40 He was credited with having founded four towns in his new

homeland in the toe of Italy, namely Petilia, Krimissa, Makalla and Chone,41 all of them thor-
oughly insigniﬁcant places (as is characteristic of the foundations that were ascribed to Greek
heroes in the Italian west, see p. 580). Now that his wanderings were over and done with, he
raised a temple to Apollo Aleios (the Wanderer) at Krimissa and hung his great bow in it as
a dedication to the god; or in other accounts, he dedicated his bow in the sanctuary of Apollo
at Thurii or at Makalla (from where it was later taken to Kroton).42 Other relics of the kind
could be seen in that part of the world; at the little town of Lageria, for instance, between
Thurii and Metapontum, visitors could see the tools that had been used by Epeios (its
supposed founder) when constructing the Wooden Horse.43 Another notable hero who was
transferred to the Italian west in the later tradition was Idomoneus, king of Crete; but the
tales that were invented to account for his exile (see p. 355) are more interesting than anything
that is recorded of his subsequent life.
The adventures of Kalchas and other Greeks who travelled 
overland within Asia Minor
We must now consider the adventures of some heroes who travelled away by land
after the fall of Troy. Two groups are mentioned as having done so in the Returns,
ﬁrstly the seer Kalchas and some companions who travelled south in Asia Minor,
and then Neoptolemos and his party who set off by land for north-western Greece.
KALCHAS and some of his comrades left their ships at Troy and made their way
to the city of Kolophon, about half-way down the coast, setting off just before the
departure of Agamemnon. According to our summary of the Returns, he was accom-
panied by Leonteus and Polypoites44 (who had been the leaders of the Lapiths during
the war, see p. 556); and some later sources add the names of Podaleirios, son of
Asklepios, and Amphilochos, son of Amphiaraos.45 It was said that they decided to
make this land journey either because their ships were no longer seaworthy or because
Kalchas could foretell by his own divinatory powers that danger awaited the ﬂeet
at sea.46 After arriving in Kolophon, Kalchas and his companions were entertained
by another celebrated seer, MOPSOS, who was a grandson of the great Theban seer
Teiresias (see p. 331). Before long, however, the two seers quarrelled over the art
of divination and challenged one another to a contest, a risky enterprise for Kalchas
because he had been warned by an oracle that he would die if he ever met a better
diviner than himself. In Apollodorus’ account of the story, Kalchas started the contest
by posing a question to Mopsos, who was asked to say how many ﬁgs were growing
on a ﬁg-tree nearby. He replied that there were ten thousand, or a bushel by volume
with a single ﬁg left over, which turned out to be correct; but when Mopsos then
asked Kalchas to tell him how many piglets a certain sow was carrying, Kalchas
replied incorrectly that there were eight, and Mopsos was able to correct him in
advance by foretelling that the sow would give birth to nine piglets, all of them
male, at the sixth hour on the following day. Kalchas was so distraught when this
turned out to be correct that he died or took his own life.47
This is apparently a composite version put together from two earlier accounts in which
Kalchas posed a single question to Mopsos; a similar pattern can be observed in the account
offered by the Hellenistic poet Lycophron. In a Hesiodic account, probably from the Melam-
podeia, Kalchas died after Mopsos was found to have given the correct answer to the question
— The returns of the Greeks —
488

of the ﬁgs;48 while in another early version ascribed to Pherecydes, Kalchas died after Mopsos
replied correctly to the question about the piglets (in this case by saying that the sow would
give birth to three piglets, one of them female).49
According to a wholly different account, a rivalry developed between Kalchas and Mopsos
over the possession of the oracle of Apollo at Klaros (near Kolophon, see p. 331), and matters
came to a head when Mopsos predicted defeat for Amphimachos, king of Lydia, in a forth-
coming war, while Kalchas urged the king on with a prediction of victory. When the king
was then defeated, Mopsos came to be honoured all the more highly and Kalchas committed
suicide.50 Proclus’ summary of the Returns states, rather surprisingly, that Teiresias died at
Kolophon and was buried there by Kalchas’ party (but Teiresias’ name may well have been
substituted for that of Kalchas by error).51
After the death of Kalchas, his companions dispersed in various directions. Polypoites
and Leonteus travelled eastward to settle in the land of the Medes, or else returned
to Troy and sailed home to Thessaly.52 Podaleirios visited the Delphic oracle to ask
where he should settle, and was advised to make his home in a place where he would
suffer no harm if the sky fell in; and he therefore settled at Syreon in the Carian
Chersonnese, a place that was encircled by tall mountains on every side.53 And ﬁnally,
AMPHILOCHOS, who was a seer like so many descendants of Melampous (see 
p. 429), joined together with Mopsos to found a joint oracle at Mallos in Cilicia, in
the south-eastern corner of Asia Minor. Although Amphilochos decided to sail home
after a time, the situation there proved unsatisfactory and he returned to Mallos a year
later to reclaim his original position; but he found that Mopsos was unwilling to
accept him back, and each caused the death of the other when they tried to settle 
the matter by single combat. They worked together happily enough during their
posthumous existence nonetheless, continuing to deliver prophecies at their joint
oracle, which was highly regarded in Hellenistic times.54 Another tradition suggested
that Amphilochos founded Amphilochian Argos after the Trojan War, a city on the
Ambracian Gulf in southern Epirus.55
Neoptolemos travels overland to Epirus with Helenos and 
Andromache; his marriage and early death
NEOPTOLEMOS, the young son of Achilles, was usually said to have avoided the
dangers of the sea-crossing. According to the Returns, he travelled overland on the
advice of his grandmother Thetis, crossing over to northern Greece by way of Thrace;
he encountered Odysseus in south-western Thrace in the course of his journey, at the
coastal town of Maroneia (see p. 489), and buried his father’s aged tutor Phoinix when
he died on the way. Instead of travelling to his father’s homeland in Thessaly (which
he had never seen because he had been reared on Skyros, the home-island of his
mother, see p. 458), he settled in the north-west in the land of the Molossians in
Epirus.56 Apollodorus adds two further details which may well have come from the
early epic tradition, stating that Neoptolemos sailed with Agamemnon’s section 
of the ﬂeet as far as Tenedos, but delayed on the island at the urging of Thetis when
the others resumed their voyage, and waited there for two days before continuing his
journey by the land-route; in this account, furthermore, as in most others, he was

accompanied by two notable Trojans, namely Andromache, the widow of Hektor,
who had been assigned to him during the division of the spoils, and the seer Helenos,
a son of Priam who had fallen out with his fellow Trojans (see p. 471).57 Although
most post-Homeric sources accept that he settled in Epirus, he is occasionally said to
have travelled part or all of the way by sea, either sailing across to Thessaly, where
he burned his ships on the advice of Thetis before proceeding overland to Epirus,58
or else wandering far off course to Epirus as he was attempting to sail to his birth-
place on Skyros.59
By defeating the local people in battle, Neoptolemos won a kingdom for himself
in Epirus, and settled there with Andromache as his concubine; she bore him a son,
Molossos, who later succeeded to the throne and gave his name to his subjects, the
Molossians.60 Although Neoptolemos also had a legitimate wife, Hermione, the
daughter of Menelaos and Helen, it was commonly agreed that she bore him no
children. According to the Odyssey, Menelaos had promised her to him at Troy, and
sent her to him in the city of the Myrmidons (i.e. Phthia, the home of Peleus and
Achilles in Thessaly) after returning from the war;61 but she was usually thought
to have lived with him in Epirus in the subsequent tradition. In many accounts
from the classical period onwards, she had already been given or promised to Orestes
while Menelaos was away at Troy, and conﬂict thus arose between Orestes and
Neoptolemos when the latter claimed his bride after the end of the war (see further
on pp. 514–5).
Neoptolemos’ grandfather Peleus was still alive at the end of the Trojan War. The Homeric
epics indicate that the aged king of Phthia was in a sadly vulnerable position while his only
son Achilles was away at Troy,62 and some later sources claim that Akastos or the sons of
Akastos expelled him from his kingdom after the death of Achilles. Akastos and his family
certainly had good reason to hate him since he had sacked their city of Iolkos (see p. 534 for
the circumstances). In one account, Peleus tried to ﬁnd his way to Neoptolemos after he was
expelled by Archandros and Architeles, the two sons of Akastos, but was driven by a storm
to the island of Kos, where he was sheltered by a certain Molos until his death.63 Our
summary of the Returns states without further explanation that Neoptolemos was acknow-
ledged by his grandfather after reaching the land of the Molossians; we should perhaps assume
that Peleus travelled there to seek his grandson after being expelled from his kingdom.
A late source, Dictys, provides an interesting narrative which may have originated in
tragedy, saying that Neoptolemos sailed over from Molossia to help his grandfather after
hearing of his expulsion, and found him hiding in a cave on the Sepiades, a group of islands
to the west of southern Thessaly. Neoptolemos ambushed and killed the sons of Akastos,
here named Menalippos and Pleisthenes, when they visited the islands on a hunting-trip;
and he then lured Akastos to the cave by disguising himself as a Trojan captive and telling
him that Neoptolemos was lying there unguarded. Thetis intervened, however, to prevent
Neoptolemos from killing Akastos; and after this narrow escape, Akastos agreed to surrender
all claim to the kingdom of Peleus. So Neoptolemos went off to reclaim it in the company
of his father and grandmother Thetis.64 It was not often suggested that Neoptolemos himself
came to rule in Phthia.65 In some accounts, as we will see (p. 534), Peleus killed Akastos
before the Trojan War while sacking his city of Iolkos.

Although varying accounts were offered of the precise course of events, it was
commonly agreed that Neoptolemos met a violent death at Delphi before many
years had passed. Three main versions of his death-story can be distinguished, stating
either that he was killed in a quarrel over the sacriﬁces, or that he provoked his
own death by demanding reparation from Apollo for the death of his father, or that
Orestes murdered him or arranged his murder because he was angry at having lost
Hermione to him.
(i) According to Pindar, Neoptolemos visited Delphi to dedicate some of the ﬁnest
of the Trojan spoils to Apollo, but became embroiled in a quarrel over the meat from
the sacriﬁces and met his death as a consequence. As the scholia explain, he objected
to the traditional practice by which the temple attendants kept most of the meat for
themselves.66 The Delphian who killed him was sometimes said to have been a certain
Machaireus (Knife-man), son of Daïtes (Divider or Apportioner), whose name refers
to the special knife or machaira that the priests would use to divide the meat. Such a
knife would have been well-ﬁtted to serve as a murder-weapon if a dispute over the
meat had turned violent; Pindar mentions that Neoptolemos was killed with a
machaira (and may perhaps have intended that his audience should recall the name of
the killer from this).67 In a somewhat different account from another poem, Pindar
states that Apollo had planned an early death for Neoptolemos because of the manner
in which he had killed Priam (i.e. at an altar of Zeus, see p. 476), and therefore slew
him in his sacred precinct while he was quarrelling with the temple attendants.68
According to Pherecydes, Neoptolemos visited Delphi to consult the oracle about his
childless marriage, but was moved to anger when he saw the Delphians removing
meat from the sanctuary and tried to take it away from them; although the surviving
quotation goes on to state that the hero killed himself with a machaira, the text is
surely corrupt, and we can safely assume that he would have been killed by a
Delphian as usual.69
(ii) Some accounts claim that Neoptolemos went to Delphi to seek reparation
from Apollo for having killed or helped to kill his father Achilles at Troy (see 
p. 468 for the circumstances). When he proceeded to plunder the temple or even
set ﬁre to it, he was killed by the temple attendants, or by Machaireus speciﬁcally,
or by Apollo himself.70
(iii) In other accounts, Orestes killed Neoptolemos at Delphi, or at least arranged
for him to be killed there because he was angry at having lost his wife Hermione
to him (see pp. 514–15 for the circumstances). This version ﬁrst appears in Euripides’
Andromache, and it is quite possible that Euripides was responsible for its invention;
it was probably not very old in any case.71 In this play, incidentally, Hermione had
not previously been married to Orestes although she had been promised to him; see
p. 515 for a summary of the plot and for other accounts.
Neoptolemos was honoured in hero-cult at his Delphian tomb, which could be seen
in the precinct of Apollo if one turned to the left after leaving the temple. Pindar
indicates that his death was divinely ordained because he was destined to watch over
the ceremonies at the shrine. He was supposed to have come to the assistance of the
Delphians when they were attacked by the Gauls in 279 BC.72

THE WANDERINGS OF ODYSSEUS AND 
HIS LATER LIFE
Odysseus wanders through distant seas for ten years
Odysseus was driven far off course and wandered the seas for ten years before ﬁnally
rejoining his wife Penelope in his native Ithaca; we will follow his adventures as
they are described in the Odyssey, marking each successive landfall. (i) According to
Nestor’s account of the Greek returns in the Odyssey, Odysseus initially set off with
Menelaos’ section of the ﬂeet, but parted with it as a result of unspeciﬁed disagree-
ments when it called in at the island of Tenedos nearby (see p. 483), and headed
back towards Troy with his followers.73 (ii) Odysseus mentions nothing of this in
his own narrative, merely stating that the wind bore him from Troy to Ismaros, a
town of the CICONIANS (Kikones) in south-western Thrace. At the outset, he had
twelve ships under his command. He launched a frankly piratical raid on Ismaros,
and captured the women of the city and quantities of treasure; but when his men
insisted on delaying to feast and drink, the Ciconians of the surrounding area gath-
ered to make a counter-attack, and expelled the Greeks, causing many losses.74
During the sack of the city, Odysseus protected MARON, son of Euanthos, the
local priest of Apollo, along with his wife and child; and Maron repaid him by
giving him some treasure and twelve jars of sweet wine,75 which would prove invalu-
able, as we will see shortly, when his own life came under threat from the Kyklops
Polyphemos. (iii) After leaving the land of the Ciconians, Odysseus and his followers
were driven southwards for two days and nights to Cape Malea at the south-eastern
tip of the Peloponnese; and as they were trying to sail round the cape to make for
Ithaca (off the west coast of mainland Greece), they were caught by the savage North
Wind and were driven across the sea for nine days and nights to the land of the
LOTOS-EATERS. As with all the places visited by Odysseus during his more distant
wanderings, their land is located in a purely mythical realm in Homer’s account,
even if later tradition placed it on the Libyan coast.76 When Odysseus sent some
of his men to investigate, the Lotos-eaters received them graciously and offered them
some of their lotos-fruit, which caused those who ate it to forget their homecoming
and friends and to desire nothing more than to sit there chewing the honey-sweet
fruit. On discovering what had happened to them, Odysseus dragged them back to
their ships by force and made a hasty departure.77
(iv) From there he sailed on to the land of the KYKLOPES, who were a race of
giants with a single eye in the middle of their forehead. Leaving the other ships
and their crews at an uninhabited island not far off the coast, he went exploring
with his own crew, entered the deserted cave of a Kyklops called POLYPHEMOS,
and gazed at the many crates of cheese and pens crowded with lambs and kids that
ﬁlled the cave. Against all the advice of his comrades, who urged him to steal some
provisions and hurry away, Odysseus insisted that they should wait until the owner
returned, for he was curious to see what he was like and hoped to receive gifts of
hospitality. After driving his ﬂocks into the cave, Polyphemos blocked up the
entrance with a huge rock; and on discovering the strangers, he demonstrated his
notion of hospitality by dashing out the brains of two of them and eating their ﬂesh
— The returns of the Greeks —
492

for his supper. In the morning, he breakfasted in the same way and then drove his
ﬂocks to pasture, pushing the rock back afterwards to leave the men imprisoned.
Odysseus now had time to devise a means of vengeance. To kill the giant as he
slept would achieve nothing, for he and his comrades would be unable to shift the
rock; so he sharpened a stake and hardened its end in the ﬁre to procure a weapon
for use against the Kyklops, and on that evening, when Polyphemos had supped on
two more of his men, gave him a draught of some very powerful wine that he had
received from Maron at Ismaros. Having made him very drunk by this means, he
and his men heated the end of the stake and used it to gouge out the single eye of
their jailer. Polyphemos cried out to his fellow Kyklopes, who lived on the heights
around, and they came rushing from every side to investigate. Odysseus had prepared
for this eventuality, however, by telling Polyphemos that his name was Nobody
(Outis); so when the Kyklopes asked him what the trouble was, and he replied from
inside that ‘Nobody’ was attacking him, they went away again, supposing that he
must simply be ill if nobody was causing him any harm. In the morning, when
Polyphemos opened the cave to let out his sheep and goats, Odysseus and his men
escaped with them, each of the men tied to the underside of a ram, and Odysseus
clinging to the belly of the largest ram of all.78 While sailing off in his ship,
Odysseus taunted the Kyklops in the heedlessness of his triumph, and revealed his
true name. Polyphemos responded by hurling two huge stones at the ship, which
narrowly escaped destruction, and then praying to his father Poseidon to take action
against the newly identiﬁed Odysseus. He prayed that Odysseus should never reach
home, or if he was fated to do so, that he should arrive home late after losing all
his comrades and ﬁnd trouble awaiting him in his house.79
(v) After his encounter with the Kyklopes, Odysseus made a happier landfall at
Aiolia, the island of AIOLOS, ruler of the winds, who entertained him and his men
without stint for a full month. Each of the six sons of Aiolos was married to one
of his six daughters, and all of them lived together at the palace with their father

and mother, feasting continually day after day. His kingdom is a purely mythical
place in the Odyssey, a ﬂoating island surrounded by cliffs of unyielding bronze; but
it came to be suggested in the later tradition that he lived on one of the Aeolian
(Lipari) Islands to the north of Sicily. He ﬁnally helped Odysseus on his way by
enclosing all but one of the winds in a leather bag and attaching it to his ship, so
that only the gentle west wind was left to blow him safely home. When Ithaca
came within sight and there seemed no further occasion for worry, Odysseus fell
asleep after his long exertions at the helm, and his men took advantage of this to
investigate the contents of the bag, supposing that it contained gifts of silver and
gold that he was intending to keep for himself; but as soon as they opened it up,
the winds rushed out and blew them straight back to their starting-point. Aiolos
turned Odysseus away without further help, saying that it would be wrong for him
to offer assistance to a man who was evidently hated by the gods.80
(vi) After six days on the high seas, the voyagers reached the land of the LAISTRY-
GONIANS (Laistrygones), a race of cannibal giants. When three of the crew were
sent ashore to investigate, they ran across the daughter of the king as she was
fetching water, and she took them to the palace; the queen, who was as large as a
mountain, summoned her husband Antiphates, who seized one of the men for his
supper while the others ﬂed to the ships. Alerted by the shouts of Antiphates, the
other Laistrygonians hurried to the cliffs around the harbour, sank the ships below
by hurling huge boulders at them, and then speared the crewmen like ﬁsh to provide
themselves with fresh meat. Odysseus and his crew alone survived because their ship
was moored outside the harbour entrance.81
(vii) Odysseus’ next port of call was the mythical island of Aiaie, the home of the
enchantress KIRKE (Circe), who was a daughter of Helios by the Okeanid Perse (or
Perseis) and the sister of Aietes.82 Observing a column of smoke arising from Kirke’s
house in the forested interior, Odysseus divided his forces into two and sent one
group to investigate under the command of his brother-in-law Eurylochos. On
arriving at the house in the forest, they encountered lions and wolves outside which
fawned on them, standing on their hind legs and wagging their tails rather than
attacking them as might be expected; for these were human beings whom Kirke
had transformed by means of her enchantments. Kirke seemed most friendly and
invited them to drink some barley-mixture, but it contained some drugs that trans-
formed them into pigs, although they retained their human intelligence. Eurylochos
had remained outside, however, suspecting a trap, and he rushed back to Odysseus
to report what had happened. As Odysseus was hurrying to the rescue, he ran across
Hermes, who gave him a herb called moly to serve as a counter-charm. He was thus
unaffected by Kirke’s drugs, and she was so dismayed when he proceeded to threaten
her with his sword that she proposed that they should settle their differences by
going to bed together. She then swore not to harm him and agreed to return his
comrades to their original form. In the later tradition, Kirke was said to have borne
children to Odysseus, namely Telegonos (see below), Latinos and Agrios.83 When
his comrades began to grow impatient after a year on the island, he asked Kirke to
allow them to continue on their way, and was alarmed to be told that he must ﬁrst
visit the Underworld to seek a prophecy from the ghost of Teiresias.84
— The returns of the Greeks —
494

(viii) In accordance with Kirke’s instructions, he sailed across the outer Ocean to a
land of gloom in the furthermost west, and arrived safely at the boundaries of Hades
(see p. 109). After pouring some blood into a trench to allow the shades to drink from
it to revive their wits, he was able to speak to many of them, including his mother
Antikleia, who had died (or perhaps killed herself) during his absence; she was 
able to tell him about the state of affairs at home and about the sorrows of his ageing
father Laertes.85 Teiresias prophesied that he would reach home in spite of the antag-
onism of Poseidon (who had been angered by the blinding of Polyphemos), but
warned that he would lose his comrades and ship if they harmed the cattle of Helios
on the way (see below); and he also told him that he could expect trouble at home,
since his halls were thronged with suitors who were courting his wife and wasting
his property. After killing the suitors, he should travel abroad to the mainland 
(so Teiresias advised), and proceed inland with an oar until he met people who knew
nothing of the sea and mistook the oar for a winnowing-fan. He should then ﬁx the
oar into the ground and make his peace with Poseidon by sacriﬁcing a ram, bull and
boar to him. In the end, after all his troubles, he could expect to meet a peaceful death
among his own people in his prosperous old age.86 Other aspects of Odysseus’ visit
to the Underworld are discussed in connection with the mythology of that realm in
Chapter 4.

Figure 14.2

(ix) After returning to Kirke’s island, Odysseus set off on his journey home, and
soon had to confront some fearsome perils, forearmed with advice from Kirke.87 He
had to ﬁnd his way past the SIRENS (Seirenes) ﬁrst of all, female daimones who
sang so enchantingly that passing sailors were lured to their island, where they
apparently wasted away because they could turn their attention to nothing other
than the sweet singing. Homer describes them as sitting in a meadow surrounded
by the mouldering bodies of their victims. Odysseus ordered his men to stop their
ears with wax, and had himself bound to the mast, giving strict orders that he
should be tied all the tighter if he tried to break loose; and he was thus able to
enjoy the song and yet live to tell the tale.88
Since nothing is stated about the outward appearance of the Sirens in the Odyssey, Homer
may have imagined them as being like human women in form. In the subsequent litera-
ture, however, and in the visual arts from the time of the earliest representations in the
sixth century BC, they are commonly pictured as Harpy-like creatures with the body of a
bird and head of a woman. There are generally three of them, though only two in the Odyssey,
and they are usually said to have been children of the river-god Acheloos by one or other
of the Muses.89
According to a tradition that ﬁrst appears in Apollonius’ Argonautica, they had once been
servants or companions of the young Persephone.90 Transformation myths were devised in
this connection to explain their peculiar form. Ovid states that they were originally human
in form, but prayed to be furnished with wings while they were searching for the abducted
Persephone, to enable them to extend their search over the seas also.91 Or in Hyginus’
version, this was apparently a punishment that was imposed on them by Demeter because
they had failed to come to the aid of Persephone.92 There was also a wholly different story
in which they were transformed by Aphrodite because they had scorned the joys of love.93
The Hellenistic poet Lycophron is the ﬁrst to report that they were fated to hurl them-
selves into the sea if anyone should survive after hearing their singing, as did Odysseus.94
Local traditions in western Italy claimed that their bodies were washed ashore on different
parts of the coast from Naples southwards.95 The Siren Parthenope, who was supposedly
washed ashore at Naples, had a most interesting cult there and an annual festival in which
she was honoured with torch-races.96
See p. 395 for the Argonauts’ encounter with the Sirens, which is set at an earlier period
in mythical history. There is also a strange story in which Hera persuaded them to engage
in a singing-contest with the Muses (see p. 207), who celebrated their victory by plucking
out the Sirens’ feathers to make crowns for themselves.97
Odysseus had learned from Kirke that he would have to choose between two possible
routes after passing the Sirens, for he could either face the hazard of the Planktai
(Wandering Rocks) or try to make a safe passage through the narrow straits between
the monstrous SKYLLA and the whirlpool CHARYBDIS; but since Kirke had
warned him that only a single ship, the Argo, had ever survived the Planktai, and
then only with the help of the Nereids (see p. 395), he was bound to select the
latter route.98 Preferring to lose a few of his men to Skylla than to face the risk of
having his ship sucked into the whirlpool crew and all, Odysseus steered closer to
Skylla than to Charybdis. The six-headed monster, who lived in a cave in the side
of a cliff, duly reached out to snatch away six men, but the rest of the crew survived
unscathed.99
— The returns of the Greeks —
496

In Homer’s description, Skylla had twelve legs and six long necks, each ending in a frightful
head with three rows of teeth; the lower part of her body was concealed inside her cave, but
she would reach out with her necks to seize dolphins or seals, or sailors from passing ships.100
Later tradition suggested that she lived in a cave in the Straits of Messina, the narrow channel
that separates Italy from Sicily, although rationalizers were eager to explain away this sailor’s
yarn by alleging that a whirlpool, rock or other natural danger of the area lay behind it.101
She is usually depicted in works of art with a woman’s upper body and head, and a lower
body formed from one or two ﬁsh-tails or dragon-tails, and often with the fore-parts of one
or more dogs springing from her hips. Late authors explain her monstrous form through
transformation stories. On learning that Poseidon had embarked on a love affair with Skylla
(here described as a daughter of Phorkys), his wife Amphitrite sprinkled magic herbs into
her bathing-place, causing her to be transformed from a beautiful nymph into a many-headed
monster.102 Or in Ovid’s version, the sea-god Glaukos fell in love with Skylla, and sought
the help of the enchantress Kirke when she failed to respond; but Kirke herself promptly
fell in love with Glaukos, and was so jealous when he reafﬁrmed his love for Skylla that she
transformed her into a monster by sprinkling her bathing-place with herbs and chanting
magical spells.103
(x) The voyagers arrived next at the island of THRINACIA (Thrinakie), where the
cattle and sheep of the sun-god Helios were pastured under the care of his daugh-
ters Phaethousa and Lampetie. Having received warnings on the matter from both
Teiresias and Kirke, Odysseus made his men swear that they would on no account
slaughter any of the god’s cattle or sheep; but when they ran short of food after
being held back on the island for a full month by adverse winds, they killed some
of the cattle without the knowledge of their leader, while he was in another part
of the island praying to the gods for help. Lampetie reported the theft to her father
Helios, who complained in his turn to Zeus; and Zeus struck Odysseus’ ship with
a thunderbolt as it was sailing away from the island, causing the entire crew to be
killed apart from Odysseus himself.104
(xi) While making his way to safety as best he could on a raft constructed from
the wreckage, Odysseus was almost sucked into Charybdis, but survived to be washed
ashore on the island of KALYPSO nine days afterwards.105 Kalypso, who is described
as a daughter of Atlas, was a minor goddess who lived all on her own on the island
of Ogygia. She was delighted by the handsome stranger and detained him on her
island as her lover for seven long years; but although she offered to make him
immortal and ageless, he yearned for his wife and his native land and grew ever
more sorrowful. Athena ﬁnally intervened with the gods on his behalf, prompting
Zeus to send Hermes to Kalypso to order his release. She consented, though with
a heavy heart, and helped him on his way by furnishing him with tools and mate-
rials to enable him to build a large boat.106
(xii) Odysseus sailed over the sea for nineteen days until he came within sight of
Scherie, the land of the PHAEACIANS (Phaiakes), on the eighteenth; but before
he could draw into the coast, his enemy Poseidon, who had been away feasting with
the Ethiopians, caught sight of his boat and realized that the gods must have acted
to help him. So the god set to work to reverse his good fortune, by raising a mighty
storm to wreck his boat (see further on p. 100). His plight was observed, however,
by the sea-goddess Leukothea (formerly Ino, see p. 421), who felt pity for him and

lent him her divine veil (kre¯demnon), telling him that he would be saved from drown-
ing if he tied it around his chest. After two days and nights in the water, he managed
to crawl ashore by the mouth of a river in Scherie, weakened and exhausted but
alive. As soon as he had dropped the veil back into the water to allow Leukothea
to recover it, he lay down under some bushes nearby and fell asleep.107
On the next morning, NAUSIKAA, the daughter of ALKINOOS, king of the
Phaeacians, came to the river-mouth with her maids to wash the clothes of the
household. Odysseus was awakened by them as they were playing a ball-game after-
wards, and emerged from the bushes to investigate, naked and salt-streaked, hastily
breaking off a leafy branch to hold in front of him. Nausikaa stood to face him as
all her maidens ﬂed, and responded sympathetically when he explained his troubles
and asked for help. After providing him with clothes and refreshment, she guided
him to the city and advised that he should appeal as a suppliant to her mother
ARETE, who was greatly honoured by the king and the people alike.108 The king
and queen welcomed him into their palace, and at a great banquet on the following
day, the whole company listened with hushed interest as Odysseus recounted the
story of his adventures; we learn most of what we know about his wanderings from
his own narrative on this occasion.109 After loading a ship with magniﬁcent gifts
and offering appropriate sacriﬁces, Alkinoos sent Odysseus on his way on the
following evening. As the magical ship sped through the sea on its overnight journey
to Ithaca, ﬂying faster than the swiftest of birds, Odysseus slept on a rug on the
deck; and he was still fast asleep when the sailors laid him ashore at the end of the
journey, placing his gifts under an olive-tree nearby. When he woke up to ﬁnd
himself alone on the shore, he did not appreciate that he was home after his long
years of wandering until he was assured of the fact by his protectress Athena.110
Poseidon had to content himself with turning the Phaeacian ship to stone on its
return, as a hint (which was duly taken) that the Phaeacians should never provide
passage to mortals in such a way in the future.111
Odysseus exacts vengeance on the suitors after arriving home in 
Ithaca, and is reunited with his wife Penelope
To protect Odysseus while he made preparations for his revenge against the suitors,
Athena altered his appearance to cause him to be mistaken for an old beggar, and
told him to take shelter with his faithful swineherd Eumaios as she travelled over
to the Peloponnese to summon his son Telemachos (who had been visiting Nestor
and Menelaos to seek news of him).112 Odysseus revealed his true identity to
Telemachos on his arrival, though not yet to Eumaios, and the three of them walked
to the palace on the following morning. Although the disguised king received a
touching welcome from his old hound Argos, the suitors mistook him for a beggar
as would be expected, and their leader, Antinoos, treated him with great brutality,
hurling a stool at him and setting up a ﬁght between him and the beggar Iros.
After the suitors had taken their ﬁll of food and drink in the evening, however,
they went to their homes for the night at the urging of Telemachos, giving him
and his father an opportunity to prepare for the forthcoming conﬂict by removing
all the arms and armour from the hall and locking them away in a store-room.113

By pretending that he was a brother of Idomeneus, king of Crete, and that he
had entertained Odysseus on his home island shortly after the war, the disguised
Odysseus won the sympathy of Penelope, who was now at her wit’s end. For she
had tried to put the suitors off by telling them that she would be unable to remarry
until she had woven a shroud in preparation for the death of her father-in-law Laertes,
and then extending the task by unravelling each day’s work during the following
night; but the stratagem had ﬁnally been betrayed by one of her maids, and she
had now reached the end of the work. She disclosed that she was intending to
announce on the next morning that she would marry the suitor who could string
her husband’s bow (a formidable weapon which would require immense strength to
draw), and then shoot an arrow through a row of double-headed axes.114 While the
suitors were attempting this feat on the next morning, Odysseus withdrew for a
while to reveal his identity to Eumaios and the cowherd Philoitios, and returned to
the hall with them as the contest was drawing to an unsuccessful conclusion. Now
that it had become clear that none of the suitors would be able to fulﬁl the demanded
terms, the disguised Odysseus asked, in an apparently ingenuous fashion, to be
allowed to try his hand. The objections of the suitors were brushed aside by Penelope,
who thought it shameful that a stranger should be treated with discourtesy, and
also by Telemachos, who was aware of his father’s plan.
Penelope left the hall at the stranger’s request before he set to work. He strung
the bow without difﬁculty, performed the prescribed feat, and then shot Antinoos,
the arrogant ringleader of the suitors, through the throat. The other suitors quaked
with fear when he now revealed his true identity; and in the furious struggle that
followed, he killed them one and all with the help of his son and his two faithful
servants, and also of Athena who intervened on occasion to deﬂect the spears of the

suitors.115 Odysseus and his helpers then completed the task by hanging twelve
disloyal servant-maids who had consorted with the suitors, and killing the goatherd
Melanthios, who had helped the suitors during the ﬁght by bringing arms from the
store-room.116 Eurykleia, an old servant-woman who had recognized the disguised
Odysseus from a scar, now awakened Penelope to tell her that her husband had
come back and had rid her of the suitors; and the reunited couple spent the night
together on their remarkable marriage-bed, which had been constructed by Odysseus
long before around the trunk of a living olive-tree.117 Odysseus made himself known
to his father Laertes on the next day, and the blood-feud that was initiated by the
dead suitors was swiftly brought to an end through the intervention of Athena.118
Posthomeric accounts of the later life of Odysseus
Odysseus is re-established in his kingdom under auspicious circumstances at the end
of the Odyssey, and we assume that he will live there happily ever afterwards, reunited
with his faithful wife; but his story was developed further in the last epic in the
Trojan cycle and in the subsequent tradition. The epic in question, the Telegonia,
which was named after Telegonos, a son who was borne to Odysseus by Kirke, was
an eccentric poem which took him abroad for further adventures and provided him
with an exotic death on his return. It will be remembered that when Odysseus met
Teiresias during his visit to the Underworld in the Odyssey, the seer instructed him
to visit the mainland after killing the suitors to offer sacriﬁces to Poseidon; although
this is plainly envisaged as a temporary visit in the Homeric account, the author of
the Telegonia took up the story and expanded it to introduce Odysseus into a long-
lasting foreign entanglement. For when he arrived in the land of the Thesprotians in
north-western Greece to offer the sacriﬁces, the queen of the Thesprotians, Kallidike,
urged him to stay and offered him the throne. So he remained and married her (appar-
ently forgetting Penelope!), and fathered a son Polypoites by her; and he defeated a
neighbouring people, the Brygoi, when they attacked the kingdom, even though they
gained an initial victory owing to the support of the war-god Ares.119
After the death of Kallidike, Odysseus transferred his Thesprotian kingdom to
Polypoites and returned to Ithaca. While he had been living with Kirke long before,
she had conceived a son, TELEGONOS, to him, who had been growing up on her
remote island in the mean time. On learning from his mother that he was a son of
Odysseus, Telegonos decided to sail off in search of him, and arrived on the coast
of Ithaca by sheer chance soon after his father had returned from Thesprotia. Having
no idea where he was, he proceeded to ravage the island (or simply to plunder some
cattle); and when Odysseus rushed to the defence of his kingdom and property,
Telegonos inﬂicted a fatal wound on him without realizing who he was.120 Telegonos
wielded a most unusual weapon, a spear tipped with the needle from a sting-ray,
which had been made for him by Hephaistos at the request of Kirke, using a stingray
that had been caught by the sea-god Phorkys.121 This account of the death of
Odysseus seems to have been inspired by some words of Teiresias in the Odyssey, in
which the seer predicts that death will come to him ex halos122 (which could mean
‘out of the sea’, although it evidently means ‘away from the sea’ in the original
context). When Telegonos discovered the identity of his victim, he was overcome
— The returns of the Greeks —
500

by grief and sailed back to Kirke’s island with his father’s corpse, also bringing
Penelope and Telemachos. The Telegonia descended into utter absurdity at this point
(if it had not done so already) by concluding with a pair of weddings in which
Telegonos married Penelope, his father’s widow, while Kirke married Telemachos,
the son of her former lover. We know from the surviving summary of the epic that
Kirke conferred immortality on Telegonos, Telemachos and Penelope; and according
to a further report that was probably also derived from the poem, she transferred
Telegonos and Penelope to the Isles of the Blessed.123
Many unorthodox accounts of the ﬁnal years and ultimate fate of Odysseus and Penelope are
recorded from the later tradition. For a representative sample, we may turn to three stories
cited by Apollodorus as variants after his summary of the events of the Telegonia. Odysseus
sent Penelope away to her father because she had been seduced by the chief suitor Antinoos,
and she bore Pan to Hermes in Arcadia on the way; or Odysseus killed her because she had
been seduced by Amphinomos (another of her suitors, who is presented in the Odyssey as
being more civilized and scrupulous than his fellows); or Odysseus was sentenced to exile
for having killed the suitors, and sought refuge at the court of Thoas in Aetolia (see pp.
419–20), where he married the king’s daughter and fathered a son by her.124 Tales of this
kind are really of little interest except as curiosities; it is surely better to leave Odysseus
and Penelope as Homer leaves them at the end of the Odyssey, living peacefully together in
Ithaca after a sufﬁciency of adventures and misadventures.
THE HISTORY OF THE PELOPIDS
While Agamemnon was away at Troy, his wife Klytaimnestra (Clytemnestra) took
his cousin Aigisthos as her lover, and the two of them joined together to contrive
the murder of the king on his return. As sons of Atreus and Thyestes respectively,
Agamemnon and Aigisthos belonged to two different branches of the Pelopid family,
which had been divided by mutual hatred ever since Atreus and Thyestes had ﬁrst
begun to compete by fair means or foul for the throne of Mycenae, which had been
under Inachid rule until that time. The Pelopids were latecomers not only to
Mycenae and the Argolid but even to the Peloponnese itself since Pelops, the father
of Thyestes and Atreus, had been the ﬁrst member of the family to establish himself
in Greece. For he had been born far away in Asia Minor, where his father Tantalos
had ruled over a corner of Lydia. Before considering Agamemnon’s return and the
death that awaited him in his homeland, we will trace the notoriously violent history
of his family from the very beginning.
Tantalos of Lydia and his children
Pelops, the founder of the Pelopid family in Greece, was the eponym of the
Peloponnese (the name of which is thus interpreted as meaning the island – i.e.
peninsula – of Pelops). He ruled at Pisa in the north-western Peloponnese while his
most important sons, Agamemnon and Menelaos, rose to power in Mycenae and
Sparta, which had previously been ruled by Inachid (see p. 243) and Atlantid lines
(see p. 524) respectively. If Pelopid rule in these centres was late established, it was
also relatively short-lasting, since the return of the Heraklids ﬁfty (or a hundred)

years after the Trojan War marked the end of the family’s power in the peninsula 
(see p. 290).
Although it may be conjectured that Pelops originated as the eponym of a
Peloponnesian people of related name, presumably the Pelopes,125 he was already
regarded as an immigrant from the east in the early archaic tradition, as a son of
TANTALOS, who ruled the lands around Mt Sipylos in Lydia. According to the
standard tradition as ﬁrst recorded by Euripides, Tantalos was a son of Zeus, and
his mother is reported to have been a certain Plouto (Wealth), which seems appro-
priate enough for a man who was proverbial for his riches.126 In addition to enjoying
exceptional worldly wealth, he beneﬁted from the special favour of the gods, who
allowed him to mix with them on familiar terms and share in their feasts; but as
we have already seen, his good fortune tempted him to presumption, and he was
condemned to everlasting torment for abusing his privileges. For the different
accounts of his crime, and the nature of his posthumous punishment, see pp. 117–18.
He had a daughter, Niobe, who married Amphion, king of Thebes, but returned
to her Asian homeland to die (see pp. 157 and 306), and two sons, the great Pelops
and his far less famous brother Broteas, who remained in Asia Minor.127
Tantalos was sometimes credited with a further son, Daskylos, who ruled over the Mariandyn-
ians in Bithynia on the north coast of Asia Minor. Lykos, the son and successor of Daskylos,
offered a friendly welcome to the Argonauts when they called in at his land during their
voyage to Colchis (see p. 389). According to Apollonius, he told them how Herakles had
visited his father while travelling through Asia to fetch the belt of the Amazon queen
Hippolyte, and had helped him to subdue some neighbouring peoples; or in another account,
Herakles performed such services for Lykos himself. Although Apollonius says nothing about
the origin of this ruling line, his ancient commentators report that Daskylos was classed as a
son of Tantalos in the writings of Herodorus and Nymphis (late ﬁfth century and third
century BC respectively), two authors from Herakleia Pontica, a Greek colony founded in that
area in the sixth century BC.128
In addition to the legends already considered in which Tantalos is said to have been
punished in the Underworld for a crime committed against the gods, a further tale of crime
and punishment is recorded for him that differs from all the others. One of the shrines of Zeus
on Crete was guarded by a golden dog, a wonderful automaton which had been fashioned by
Hephaistos; and this dog was once stolen by a certain Pandareos, son of Merops, a citizen of
Miletos in Asia Minor (or of the Cretan city of that name), who took it across to the Asian
mainland and entrusted it to Tantalos for safe-keeping. When Hermes came to seek it out at
the bidding of Zeus, Tantalos swore by Zeus and the other gods that he knew nothing of the
missing dog; but Hermes discovered it in his home nonetheless, and Zeus piled Mt Sipylos
on top of him to punish him for his perjury.129 As the author of the theft, Pandareos tried to
escape punishment by ﬂeeing to Athens and thence to Sicily, together with his wife
Harmothoe and his three unmarried daughters; but his ﬂight was observed by Zeus, who
killed him along with his wife and delivered his daughters to the Harpies.130 Or in another
version recorded in Antoninus’ anthology of transformation myths, Zeus punished Pandareos
by turning him to stone. Although it is stated here that Tantalos swore his false oath to
Pandareos when he arrived to reclaim the dog, one may suspect that this is simply an error,
especially since Zeus is said to have punished him for his perjury in the usual way. According
to this author, Rhea had originally stationed the dog to guard the she-goat that suckled the
infant Zeus at his sacred cave on Crete, and Zeus had later appointed it to be the guardian of
the cave.131
— The returns of the Greeks —
502

Very little is recorded of BROTEAS, son of Tantalos. An ancient image of the
Mother of the Gods on the side of Mt Sipylos (which still survives and was actu-
ally of Hittite origin) was identiﬁed in the local tradition as the work of Broteas.
Apollodorus’ account of his death is preserved only in a rather poor summary, which
states that he failed to honour Artemis and claimed that even ﬁre could not harm
him, and went mad as a consequence, presumably at the will of the goddess, and
hurled himself into a ﬁre. It is not known whether he lived long enough to succeed
to his father’s throne.132
In one of the various accounts of his crime, Tantalos is said to have killed his
other son, PELOPS, while he was still a boy, and to have served his ﬂesh as a meal
to the gods to test their omniscience. They recognized the true nature of the meal,
however, and soon pieced him together and brought him back to life again, achieving
this in some accounts by boiling his remains in a cauldron.133 Demeter alone ate
some of the unholy meal, consuming one of his shoulders while she was distracted
by her grief after the loss of her daughter Persephone; but she compensated him by
providing him with a new shoulder of ivory (or else the gods provided the shoulder,
or Hermes did so at the order of Zeus).134 He was now more beautiful than ever,
and grew up into such a handsome youth that Poseidon fell in love with him and
carried him off to Olympos for a while.135
Pelops wins a bride and kingdom in the Peloponnese
After he was brought down to earth again, his thoughts turned to marriage, and
he decided to seek the hand of HIPPODAMEIA, the daughter of OINOMAOS,
king of Pisa (in the region of Olympia in the western Peloponnese). He knew that
this would be a perilous enterprise because her father forced all her suitors to compete
with him in a chariot-race on the following terms. The challenger would take her
into his chariot and set off in advance of Oinomaos, who would delay until he had
sacriﬁced a lamb to Zeus; if he caught up with the suitor (as was likely because his
father Ares had provided him with a team of immortal horses), he would kill him
by thrusting a spear into his back; but if the suitor should happen to escape, he
could take Hippodameia as his wife. Twelve or more adventurers had died in this
way before the arrival of Pelops; but Pelops had an advantage over his predecessors
since he could call on the help of his divine admirer Poseidon, who gave him a
golden chariot drawn by winged horses (or else a winged chariot).136 Although this
would doubtless have sufﬁced to ensure his victory in the original story, an act of
treachery on the part of Oinomaos’ charioteer becomes the deciding factor in the
standard later tradition. Pelops corrupted this charioteer, MYRTILOS, son of
Hermes, by promising him a share of the kingdom or a night with Hippodameia;137
or else Hippodameia persuaded him to act on her behalf after falling in love with
her new suitor.138 Myrtilos sabotaged his master’s chariot by failing to insert the
linchpins into the wheel-axles (or by replacing the linchpins with waxen dummies),
causing the king to be thrown to the ground and killed when he set off in pursuit
of Pelops.139 As so often in stories of this kind, Myrtilos gained no advantage from
his treachery, for Pelops killed him in his turn soon afterwards, either to save himself
from having to pay the promised reward,140 or because Myrtilos tried to rape or

merely kiss Hippodameia, or because she falsely accused him of trying to do so.141
Some said that Oinomaos had cursed Myrtilos for his perﬁdy before succumbing to
his wounds, praying that he should perish at the hand of Pelops. By pushing him
out of his chariot as he was driving it through the sky, Pelops caused him to plunge
to his death in the sea below, in the area of the south-western Aegean that was
known as the Myrtoan Sea ever afterwards. While falling through the air, Myrtilos
cursed the house of his murderer, a curse that was destined to be fulﬁlled in ample
measure.142
It was generally agreed that the violent and brutal Oinomaos was a son of the war-god Ares;
in the local tradition, his mother was Harpina, daughter of Asopos, the eponym of a minor
town of that name near Olympia;143 but some authors, apparently following the Hesiodic
Catalogue, preferred to regard him as an Atlantid, identifying his mother as Sterope (or
Asterope), daughter of Atlas (see p. 519).144 The mythographers offered two explanations 
for his brutal treatment of his daughter’s suitors, some saying that he was in love with her
himself, and others that he had learned from an oracle that he was fated to die at the hand of
his son-in-law.145 In some accounts, he cut off the heads of the dead suitors and nailed them
to his house, or ﬁxed them to the pillars of the local temple of Ares or Poseidon.146 He had
another daughter, Alkippe, who bore Marpessa to Euenos (see p. 413), and a son, Leukippos,
who angered Apollo by courting Daphne (see p. 155). Pausanias may be consulted for the local
traditions that connected Oinomaos and Pelops with topographical features at Olympia.147
As a result of these events, Pelops won not only his favoured bride but her father’s
kingdom in addition. He married Hippodameia as soon as he had been puriﬁed by
Hephaistos. Since he was supposed to have given his name to the entire Peloponnese,
it was doubtless often assumed that he extended his power far beyond the bounds
of Pisa, as in the account of Apollodorus, renaming the peninsula after himself after
conquering much or all of it;148 but this idea cannot easily be reconciled with the
usual traditions regarding the early history of the other main regions of the
Peloponnese. If it is indeed the case that Pelops was originally the eponym of a
people called the Pelopes, these would presumably have been associated with a wider
area of the Peloponnese than the little territory of Pisa alone.
The children of Pelops and Hippodameia, and exile of 
Atreus and Thyestes
Plutarch once wrote that Pelops was the most powerful king in the Peloponnese
not so much by virtue of his possessions as of the number of his children, for he
married his daughters to men of standing and established many of his sons as rulers
of Peloponnesian cities.149 Pindar already credits him with six sons, and many more
are added to the list in later sources.150 Most are mere eponyms, however, without
any stories, and only four can be said to be of any real signiﬁcance in heroic legend,
namely Atreus and Thyestes,151 whose myths will be considered presently, and
Pittheus,152 who became the ruler of Troizen in the Argolid and contrived that his
daughter Aithra should become the mother of Theseus (see p. 341), and lastly
Alkathoos,153 who was a major ﬁgure in Megarian legend (see p. 567). To these
Kopreus, the herald of Eurystheus (see p. 257), might be added if he was indeed
— The returns of the Greeks —
504

a son of Pelops as some late sources suggest.154 Most of the other sons of Pelops
were brought into being to serve as the eponyms of various places in the Peloponnese;
for who could be a better father for eponyms of Peloponnesian cities than the 
man who gave his name to the peninsula itself? Amongst others, we ﬁnd Troizen
(who accompanied Pittheus to Troizen),155 Epidauros,156 Kleonymos (the eponym
of Kleonai in Argolid),157 Kynosuras, and Letreus158 (the eponym of Letrinai in
Elis). Pelops also had three daughters, Astydameia, Nikippe and Lysippe, who
married three sons of Perseus – Alkaios, Sthenelos and Elektryon respectively – in
the western Argolid,159 helping to prepare the way for the subsequent arrival of
Atreus and Thyestes.
In addition to his children by Hippodameia, Pelops had another son,
CHRYSIPPOS, who was either an illegitimate child by a local nymph or a son
whom he had fathered by a previous marriage.160 He favoured Chrysippos above his
other children, to such an extent that they came to imagine that he might bequeath
the throne to him. So with some encouragement from their mother, Atreus and
Thyestes eventually murdered him and threw his body down a well. Pelops came
to learn of their crime, however, and expelled them from his kingdom; and he
uttered a terrible curse against them, praying that they and their descendants should
perish in mutual strife. He also vented his fury on Hippodameia in some accounts,
causing her to kill herself or to ﬂee to Midea in the Argolid.161 For a conﬂicting
account of the death of Chrysippos, see p. 505.
In historical times, Pelops was honoured as a divine hero at his supposed burial-
place at Olympia. The magistrates used to offer an annual sacriﬁce of a black ram
at his heroic shrine, which was said to have been founded by Herakles.162 The
Pisaians and Eleians disputed the control of Olympia and of its great festival until
the district of Pisa (which was apparently ruled from a city of that name in early
times) was overrun by the Eleians, probably in the sixth century BC. The only other
mythical ruler to be recorded for it apart from Oinomaos and Pelops is its epony-
mous founder PISOS, a son of Perieres, who had settled there after leaving his father’s
kingdom of Messenia to the south.163
Atreus competes with Thyestes for the Mycenaean throne, 
and serves his children to him as a meal
After leaving the land of their birth, ATREUS and THYESTES settled in the
Argolid. Some mythographers explained that they came to that area because
Sthenelos, son of Perseus, invited them to rule Midea as his vassals after seizing
power at Mycenae (see p. 245), or because Sthenelos’ son Eurystheus entrusted
Mycenae to Atreus (who was a maternal uncle of his) when he set off to wage war
against the Heraklids (see p. 287).164 The two brothers later became embroiled in
a savage and mutually destructive power-struggle as a result of their father’s curse
(or that of Myrtilos, see above, or both curses). The trouble began when the
Mycenaeans received an oracle ordering them to choose a Pelopid as their ruler after
the death of Eurystheus, the last Inachid ruler, who was killed along with his sons
while he was trying to eliminate the Heraklids. For Atreus and Thyestes were equally
anxious to win the throne of this wealthy and powerful city, and the ensuing contest

degenerated into an unscrupulous and bloody feud.165 They could prove their claim
most effectively by demonstrating that a portent from the gods favoured one or the
other of them, and Atreus was convinced that he had the advantage because a
wonderful golden lamb had been born into his ﬂocks. Hermes had sent the lamb
in one account, knowing that it would become a cause of contention, because he
wanted to take vengeance on the family of Pelops for the murder of his son Myrtilos
(see p. 503).166 Or else it had been sent by Artemis after Atreus had made her a
vow undertaking to offer her in sacriﬁce the ﬁnest beast born in his ﬂocks; but the
golden lamb had been so beautiful that he had risked her anger by breaking his
vow, and had throttled it instead to put it (or strictly speaking, its ﬂeece) into a
chest.167 For whatever reason, the golden lamb proved to be no blessing for Atreus,
for his wife Aerope was seduced by Thyestes and secretly stole it to advance her
lover’s cause. When the Mycenaean succession was being discussed soon afterwards
at a meeting of the citizens, Thyestes proposed accordingly that the throne should
pass to the one who possessed the golden lamb, and Atreus willingly agreed to these
terms, supposing that he could produce the lamb; but it was his brother who stepped
forward with it and was acclaimed as king of Mycenae.168
This was not the end of the matter, however, since Thyestes had angered the gods
by his manipulation of the portent, and Zeus sent Hermes to Atreus to tell him
that his claim to the throne would be conﬁrmed by a far more impressive portent
than that of the lamb; for on a forthcoming day, the sun would reverse its usual
course by rising in the west and setting in the east (or reverse its course forever by
rising in the east for the ﬁrst time, instead of in the west as previously). So Atreus
persuaded his brother to promise that he would surrender the throne if this unpar-
alleled event should occur; or he simply announced that the portent of the lamb
would shortly be annulled by a far greater portent. In the face of this sign of divine
displeasure, Thyestes was obliged to abdicate in favour of Atreus, who banished him
from the land.169
When Atreus later discovered that his wife had committed adultery with his
brother and had stolen the lamb for him, he drowned her and lured Thyestes back
to Mycenae on the pretence of seeking a reconciliation. He then exacted a terrible
revenge on him by killing his sons, boiling their ﬂesh, and serving it up to him as
a meal. Thyestes ate it without hesitation since the heads, hands and feet had been
removed to disguise the true nature of the feast; but as soon as he had swallowed
it down, Atreus produced the severed extremities to show him what he had eaten,
and sent him into exile once again.170 Thyestes lost three sons as a result of his
brother’s action, Aglaos, Orchomenos and Kallileon (or Kaleos);171 or in some Latin
accounts, he lost two sons named Tantalos and Pleisthenes.172 It was sometimes
suggested that the sun reversed its course in horror at the cannibal meal rather than
as a portent during the dispute over the succession.173
Aigisthos kills Atreus to place his father Thyestes on the throne
At the outset of his second period of exile, Thyestes slept with his own daughter
PELOPIA, and fathered a new son by her, AIGISTHOS, who would ﬁnally avenge
him by killing Atreus, and so restore him to the Mycenaean throne. In one account,
— The returns of the Greeks —
506

he slept with his daughter knowingly on the advice of an oracle, which had told
him that she would bear him a son who would exact the vengeance that he desired;
or in another version, as recounted below, he raped her without recognizing her
while she was participating in nocturnal rites.174 Aeschylus’ Agamemnon offers a 
very different account of Aigisthos’ origin, stating that he was a legitimate child 
of Thyestes who escaped the fate of his brothers because he was still a baby in
swaddling-clothes at the time. He is described as the thirteenth child in the play
as we have it (but it is surely probable that there is a corruption in the text).175
Whatever the exact circumstances of his origin, he was destined to bring disaster
on the opposing branch of the family, ﬁrst by killing Atreus to put his father on
the throne, and subsequently (after Thyestes was displaced by Atreus’ son
Agamemnon) by seducing the wife of Agamemnon and conspiring in his death.
Hyginus offers an elaborate account of the events that led up to the death of Atreus, in what
is apparently a composite version based on tragic plots. After inadvertently eating his chil-
dren, Thyestes ﬂed to the court of Thesprotos (the eponym of the Thesprotians) in Epirus, and
then travelled on to Sicyon, where his daughter Pelopia was staying at the time. He happened
to arrive on a night on which sacriﬁces were being offered to Artemis, and hid himself in a
grove for fear of profaning the rites. The dancers were being led by Pelopia, who stained her
robes with blood from the sacriﬁces and went down to a stream to wash; and as she was doing
so, Thyestes jumped out of the bushes with his head veiled and raped her. Although neither
was aware of the other’s identity, Pelopia secured some evidence for the future by seizing her
assailant’s sword and hiding it away. Back in the Argolid, Mycenae was afﬂicted by barren-
ness as a result of the crime of Atreus, and the king was advised by an oracle to fetch his
brother back. Knowing that Thyestes had sought refuge with Thesprotos, Atreus travelled to
Epirus to seek him out, but found no sign of him because he had departed abroad to his grand-
father’s homeland in Asia Minor. Atreus did catch sight of Pelopia, however, at the court of
Thesprotos, and he asked to marry her in the belief that she was a daughter of the king. After
arriving at Mycenae, she gave birth to her incestuously conceived son, and exposed him; but
some shepherds suckled him at the teats of a goat (aiga in Greek, hence his name of Aigisthos)
until he was recovered at the order of Atreus, who brought him up as his own son. Some time
later, Agamemnon and Menelaos caught Thyestes at Delphi and brought him back to
Mycenae. Atreus threw him into prison and ordered Aigisthos (who was grown up by this
time) to kill him. Thyestes recognized Aigisthos’ sword as the one that had been seized from
him during the rape at Sicyon, and asked him where it had come from; and when the young
man replied that his mother had given it to him, Thyestes asked that she should be fetched.
She told him that she had seized it during the rape, and then picked it up as if to examine it
and plunged it into her breast (for she had evidently realized as a result of the preceding
conversation that the rapist had been her father). Pulling the blood-stained sword out of her
body, Aigisthos took it away and showed it to Atreus to make him believe that he had killed
Thyestes in accordance with his order; and when Atreus was subsequently offering a sacriﬁce
on the shore (presumably in thanksgiving for the death of his brother), Aigisthos took advan-
tage of this opportunity to kill him, and restored the throne to Thyestes.176
Agamemnon and Menelaos survive to expel Thyestes
Atreus left two young sons, AGAMEMNON and MENELAOS, who were smug-
gled abroad to neighbouring Sicyon by their nurse after their father’s murder. The

king of Sicyon sent them on to the court of Oineus in Calydon (presumably because
he thought that they would be safer if they were sent further away); and Tyndareos
encountered them there, evidently during the period of his Aetolian exile (see 
p. 525), and brought them back to the Peloponnese when he returned home to
Sparta. As soon as they were old enough, the two brothers travelled to Mycenae 
to recover their father’s kingdom. When Thyestes sought sanctuary at the altar of 
Hera, they allowed him to leave under safe conduct in return for an oath in which
he swore to settle on the island of Cythera (off the south-eastern tip of the
Peloponnese). Agamemnon took over the throne as the elder brother, and married
Klytaimnestra (Clytemnestra in Latin form), one of the daughters of Tyndareos.177
They had a single son, Orestes, and (in the usual tradition) three daughters,
Iphigeneia, Elektra and Chrysothemis. Menelaos, as we have seen (pp. 439ff), stayed
at Sparta with Tyndareos, marrying his putative daughter Helen and eventually
succeeding to the throne.
Agamemnon and Menelaos are sometimes described as sons of PLEISTHENES, son of Atreus,
rather than as sons of Atreus himself.178 It is stated in this connection that Atreus was
married to his niece Kleola or Kleolla, a daughter of Dias, son of Pelops, while Pleisthenes
was married to Aerope; or else the pattern is inverted and Atreus is said to have married
Aerope as usual while Pleisthenes married Kleola.179 This makes little difference since Pleis-
thenes is a shadowy ﬁgure who is said to have died prematurely, leaving his sons to be
reared by Atreus.180
Aerope was a daughter of Katreus, king of Crete; for the circumstances of her marriage
to Atreus (or Pleisthenes), see p. 355.
According to a passage in the Iliad, Agamemnon owned a sceptre of Hephaistos’ work-
manship which had been handed down within the family ever since Zeus had presented it
to Pelops; for Pelops had given it to his son Atreus, who had bequeathed it to his brother
Thyestes, who had left it to his nephew Agamemnon. This would suggest, in marked contrast
to later accounts, that power was transferred peacefully from one member of the family to
the next.181
Aigisthos and Klytaimnestra plot the death 
of Agamemnon
After Helen was abducted to Troy by Paris, Menelaos sought the help of his powerful
brother at Mycenae, and the two of them assembled a large force of allies to launch
an expedition against Troy, as recounted in the preceding chapter. Aigisthos set 
to work to avenge his father’s expulsion during their absence, by seducing
Agamemnon’s wife KLYTAIMNESTRA and seizing power at Mycenae; and since he
and Klytaimnestra could not allow the king to survive after he returned from the war,
Agamemnon’s fate was sealed. The events that led up to the death of Agamemnon
are described in the following manner in the Odyssey. Although Agamemnon had
ordered one of his servants (an aoidos, minstrel or bard) to watch over Klytaimnestra,
and the gods sent Hermes to Aigisthos to warn him not to court her or kill her
husband, Aigisthos marooned the minstrel on a desert island and soon persuaded
Klytaimnestra to yield to him, paying no heed to the bidding of the gods. He then
took her into his own house, in an unspeciﬁed corner of the Argolid, and assumed 
— The returns of the Greeks —
508

control of her husband’s kingdom.182 To ensure that he would not be caught by
surprise when Agamemnon ﬁnally returned, he posted a watchman by the shore 
and promised him a reward of two talents of gold for news of the king’s arrival; and
when Agamemnon landed in the Argolid a year afterwards, weeping for joy at his
supposed deliverance, the watchman rushed to inform his master. Picking out twenty
of his best men, Aigisthos prepared an ambush in his house, and then drove down to
the shore in his chariot to invite Agamemnon to a banquet. After the festivities, he
felled his unsuspecting guest like an ox at the corn-crib; and his followers then crept
out of their hiding-place to attack Agamemnon’s companions, and exchanged blows
with them until not a man was left alive from either party. As Agamemnon lay dying
on the ﬂoor, Klytaimnestra emerged to kill Kassandra, a captive whom he had
brought from Troy as a prize of war (see p. 479). Klytaimnestra would have been
obliged to keep out of sight until that time because she had no proper occasion to be
in the house of Aigisthos. There is no indication in Homer’s account that she had any
personal grievance against her husband; Aigisthos murdered Agamemnon out of
simple necessity to preserve his ill-gotten power, and Klytaimnestra connived in the
murder out of loyalty to her lover.183
In the later tradition from the classical period onwards, the Homeric account of
the murder of Agamemnon was largely eclipsed by the very different version that
was developed in Aeschylus’ Agamemnon, a great tragedy that gives an unexpected
depth to what was originally a simple tale of ambition, adultery and betrayal.
Klytaimnestra now becomes the dominant partner in the intrigue. It is she who
takes the precautions against Agamemnon’s return, appointing a look-out to watch
for a beacon-ﬁre announcing the fall of Troy; and she receives the returning conqueror
with deceptive enthusiasm at his own palace while Aigisthos remains out of sight.
After persuading Agamemnon to enter the palace over a path spread with purple
robes, and thus to commit an act of arrogance that is designed to provoke the gods,
she incapacitates him in his bath by throwing some clothing around him, and then
strikes him down with three blows (presumably sword-blows, although this is not
stated). The horror of the murder is in no way diminished by the fact that it takes
place off-stage, and that the audience learns of it from Agamemnon’s cries and from
Klytaimnestra’s exultant account when she reappears afterwards. Kassandra is also
killed by her, as in Homer’s version. Aigisthos ﬁnally emerges from his hiding-place
after the deeds have been committed and rejoices over the destruction of the house
of Atreus. Although Agamemnon must necessarily be killed if the usurper is to
maintain his position, just as in the earlier tradition, Klytaimnestra’s action is now
also motivated by revenge, for she has hated her husband ever since he ordered the
sacriﬁce of their daughter Iphigeneia before the war (see p. 447).184
Orestes avenges the murder of Agamemnon with the 
support of his sister Elektra
ORESTES, the only son of Agamemnon, who was still a child at the time of his
father’s murder, survived this moment of peril because he was smuggled away by
his nurse Arsinoe or Laodameia, or by his father’s herald Talthybios; or in other

versions, he was sent away by his sister Elektra, or had been sent away beforehand
by his mother.185 He was reared in exile by his maternal uncle Strophios, the king
of Krisa near Delphi (see p. 566), who brought him up with his own son Pylades.186
The two boys established a close friendship, and Pylades accompanied Orestes when
he ﬁnally returned to Mycenae to avenge his father’s murder. Our earliest source for
the latter story, the Odyssey, mentions that Orestes returned home as soon as he was
old enough, arriving eight years after Agamemnon’s death, and avenged his father
by killing Aigisthos in his turn; and since the epic also reports that Orestes ‘held
a funeral feast for the Argives over his hateful mother and the craven Aigisthos’,
we should probably assume that he killed Klytaimnestra too. The Hesiodic Catalogue
is the ﬁrst source to state explicitly that he committed matricide, by killing ‘his
overweening mother with the pitiless bronze’; and Stesichorus indicates at much the
same period that he was pursued by the Erinyes (Furies) for doing so.187
The tale of Orestes’ revenge takes the following form in the ﬁrst full account in
Aeschylus’ Libation-bearers (Choephoroi). After learning from Apollo at Delphi that he
must kill those who had been responsible for his father’s murder or else suffer griev-
ously himself, he made his way to Mycenae together with Pylades. While visiting
his father’s grave after his arrival to dedicate a lock of his hair, he encountered 
his sister Elektra, who arrived at the grave with a group of slave-women to pour
libations at the order of her mother. As Elektra explained to her brother, Klytaim-
nestra had been troubled by a sinister dream in which she had fancied that she gave
birth to a snake (evidently signifying Orestes) which bit her, drawing blood, when
she tried to suckle it, and she had therefore ordered that libations should be offered
in the hope of averting the portended danger. After approaching Agamemnon’s grave
with his sister to call on the aid of his father’s spirit, Orestes gained entrance to
the palace for Pylades and himself by pretending to Klytaimnestra (who naturally
failed to recognize him) that he was a stranger from Central Greece who had been
asked to report the death of Orestes. Once they were inside, Orestes killed Aigisthos,
who had been summoned to hear the news, and then turned his sword against
Klytaimnestra too, even though she tried to deter him by baring her breast and
begging him not to kill the mother who had suckled him.188
Sophocles and Euripides later wrote tragedies on the same theme in which Orestes’ sister plays
a fuller and more aggressive role. Sophocles’ Elektra portrays her as having been present when
Orestes’ childhood attendant (paidago¯gos) arrived at the palace to allege that Orestes had been
killed in a chariot-race, a false report at which she was as much dismayed as her mother 
was relieved. Now believing that her brother was no longer alive to avenge the murder of
Agamemnon, Elektra planned to kill Klytaimnestra and Aigisthos herself, but was unable to
persuade her more cautious sister Chrysothemis (who is rather like Ismene in the Antigone, see
p. 322) to assist her in the enterprise. Orestes and Pylades were already in Mycenae, however,
and they soon arrived at the palace, where Orestes made himself known to Elektra, who waited
outside to watch out for Aigisthos while her brother killed Klytaimnestra inside. When
Aigisthos appeared, Elektra lured him inside by telling him that he would be able to see the
body of Orestes, but the corpse that was revealed to him was that of Klytaimnestra, and 
he was killed in his turn by Orestes.189 In Euripides’ idiosyncratic play of the same title,
Aigisthos had forced Elektra to marry a poor farmer to make it impossible for any son of hers
to be able to claim the throne (although her husband, who was a man of ﬁne character, had
— The returns of the Greeks —
510

refused to consummate the marriage out of respect for her feelings). She had naturally become
embittered, and when Orestes arrived at the farm-house with his friend, she eagerly assisted
him in plotting the death of Aigisthos and Klytaimnestra; and in the case of the latter she
even played a direct part in the execution of the murder, exhorting her weaker-minded brother
when he hesitated, and putting her hand to the sword as he plunged it in. In this version,
Orestes committed the murders outside the palace where nobody would be available to protect
the victims, killing Aigisthos in the meadows while he was offering a sacriﬁce to the nymphs,
and then killing Klytaimnestra in the farm-house after she had been summoned there on the
pretence that Elektra had given birth to a son.190
Orestes is persecuted by the Erinyes
After killing his mother, Orestes was persecuted and driven mad by the Erinyes
(Furies), female spirits of vengeance who were especially ruthless in punishing
offences committed by one member of a family against another (see p. 38). This
was commonly agreed in the post-Homeric tradition at least, for there is no mention
of any such trouble in the Odyssey, which presents Orestes’ actions as exemplary and
concentrates on the killing of Aigisthos, never stating directly that he also killed
his mother. Athena urges Telemachos, the son of Odysseus, to take similar action
against the rapacious young men when have invaded the house of his absent father,
pointing to the fame that noble Orestes has won for killing his father’s murderer.191
Klytaimnestra is of interest to Homer primarily as a counter-example to Penelope,
the faithful wife of Odysseus; we should doubtless assume that Orestes, as the only
surviving male member of the household, would have been fully justiﬁed in taking
action against her. The earliest literary evidence for his persecution by the Erinyes
is contained in a report on a lost poem by Stesichorus, the Oresteia, in which Apollo
gave him a bow to defend himself against the Erinyes.192 They come to the fore in
the last two plays of Aeschylus’ Oresteia trilogy. At the end of the Libation-bearers,
soon after Orestes has killed his mother, he exclaims in horror that his mother’s
Erinyes have appeared to him, saying that they are hunting him down and that he
must now pass on;193 and they form the chorus of the ﬁnal play in the trilogy, the
Eumenides. At the beginning of that play, we ﬁnd that Orestes has ﬂed to Delphi
to seek the help of Apollo, who had ordered him to commit the murder in the ﬁrst
place. Apollo promises him his protection, but tells him to travel on to Athens and
submit himself to Athena.194 Stirred on by the ghost of Klytaimnestra, the Erinyes
follow him to Athens, where both they and Orestes agree to accept the justice of
Athena. The goddess decides the case shall be judged by a panel of twelve Athenian
citizens at the court of the Areiopagos,195 so setting a precedent for trial by jury.
Apollo himself appears as the advocate of Orestes; the Erinyes plead their own cause
with terrible eloquence; and when the votes of the jury are equally divided, Athena
as president of the court uses her casting-vote to acquit Orestes,196 so establishing
that an acquittal should be registered if the votes should ever be equal in the future
(as was the practice at Athens). To appease the Erinyes, Athena offers them a home
in her city of Athens, proposing that they should be worshipped henceforth at the
foot of the Acropolis under the new name of the Eumenides or ‘the Kindly
Goddesses’.197

The preceding tale was obviously invented at Athens, whether by Aeschylus himself or 
some earlier author; but there were also competing traditions in which Orestes was said to
have won deliverance from the Erinyes in various parts of the Peloponnese. According to a
quite early tale recorded by Pherecydes, he ﬂed to Oresthasion in south-eastern Arcadia, where
he sought sanctuary in the temple of Artemis, seating himself as a suppliant on the altar of
the goddess. When the Erinyes approached him for the kill, she drove them away accordingly,
and the city was renamed Oresteion in commemoration of the incident.198 Or in another
Arcadian legend set near the site of Megalopolis, the Erinyes manifested themselves in order
to drive him mad, appearing to him as wholly black; but when he bit off one of the ﬁngers
of his left hand in his frenzy, they suddenly seemed to turn white, and he regained sufﬁcient
composure to avert their wrath by burning sacriﬁces to them. The Erinyes had a local sanc-
tuary at Ale (Cure), the place where this was supposed to have happened.199 Or according to
the Troizenian tradition, Orestes was puriﬁed from the taint of matricide by nine men of
Troizen while seated on a sacred stone outside the temple of Artemis Lykeia; or he was cured
of his madness while sitting on a comparable stone near Gythion in Laconia.200 Or he turned
the pitiless Erinyes into the kindly Eumenides by sacriﬁcing a black sheep to them at the
Achaean town of Keryneia, which contained a sanctuary of the Erinyes that had supposedly
been founded by Orestes.201
According to some Hellenistic and later sources, Orestes was arraigned for murder by
mortal accusers and then tried in accordance with conventional procedure. In one such
version, Klytaimnestra and Aigisthos had left a child called Erigone, who prosecuted Orestes
at the Areiopagos, either on her own or in conjunction with her grandfather Tyndareos; and
she was so distressed by his subsequent acquittal that she hanged herself.202 Or else Orestes
was prosecuted at the same court by Perileos (or Perilaos), son of Ikarios, a cousin of
Klytaimnestra, since Tyndareos was no longer alive to institute proceedings;203 or Tyndareos
himself charged Orestes with murder at Mycenae, but the citizens allowed him to depart
into exile out of respect for his father.204
Orestes recovers his sister Iphigeneia from the land 
of the Taurians
According to a further tale which ﬁrst appears in Euripides’ Iphigeneia in Tauris,
Orestes discovered from Apollo at Delphi that he would not be fully delivered from
the Erinyes until he had fetched an ancient statue of Artemis from the land of the
Taurians (the Crimea).205 Although he was unaware of it as yet, his sister IPHI-
GENEIA was serving there as the priestess of Taurian Artemis; for the goddess had
spirited her away to the land of the Taurians when her father had brought her to
sacriﬁce at Aulis.206 As was described in the preceding chapter, Agamemnon
offended Artemis while the Greek army was making preparations for the voyage to
Troy at Aulis in Boeotia, and it was revealed by a seer that the goddess would
continue to hold the ﬂeet in port until Agamemnon made amends by bringing one
of his daughters to sacriﬁce (see further on p. 447). Three differing accounts were
offered of her fate after she was laid on the altar. In those accounts in which she
was said to have been killed or, at the opposite extreme, to have been rescued by
Artemis and rendered immortal, her earthly life came to an end at that point. In
this version from Euripides, however, she is said to have been rescued by Artemis
and transferred abroad as a mortal, and she can therefore re-enter the common history
of the Pelopids when she is recovered from her exile by her brother.
— The returns of the Greeks —
512

In the versions in which Iphigeneia is rescued, Artemis substitutes a deer (or some other ani-
mal) for her at the altar. She is already associated with the land of the Taurians in the earliest
surviving account from the Cypria, but as a goddess rather than priestess; although the sum-
mary of the epic offers no detail on the matter, merely stating that the goddess ‘transported
her to the Taurians and made her immortal’, she was presumably turned into the Taurian
maiden goddess who was equated with Artemis (and was served by Iphigeneia in Euripides’
account); Herodotus mentions at one point that the Taurian goddess was identiﬁed with
Iphigeneia.207 In another early account from the Hesiodic Catalogue (in which this daughter
of Agamemnon is called Iphimede), Artemis saved her by placing a phantom (eido¯lon) of her
on the altar, and rubbed her with ambrosia to make her immortal as Artemis Einodia (‘of the
wayside’); since Einodia was a title of Hekate, and the early lyric poet Stesichorus is said to
have stated that Iphigeneia was turned into that goddess, this may have meant that she became
Hekate, an infernal double of Artemis.208 In a Hellenistic account ascribed to Nicander,
Artemis is said to have rendered her immortal under the title of Orsilochia, which is reported
to have been a title of Artemis in the Tauric Chersonese. Nicander suggests that Artemis
substituted a bull (tauros) for her at the altar, and that she named the people of her new
homeland the Taurians (Tauroi in Greek) in commemoration of the fact.209
As priestess of Taurian Artemis, Iphigeneia was obliged to preside over the bloody
local rites in which any male foreigner who set foot in the land would be sacriﬁced
to the goddess. So when Orestes and his companion Pylades were captured soon
after their arrival, Thoas, the king of the Taurians, ordered that they should be
taken to Iphigeneia to be slaughtered in the customary manner. On learning that
the pair had come from Argos, Iphigeneia offered to release one of them if he would
take a message home; and when she explained who she was and asked that her
brother should be informed of her predicament, Orestes realized that she must be
his sister, whom he had considered to be dead. After sharing in the joy of their
reunion and exchanging news, Iphigeneia set to work to contrive their escape. She
told Thoas that the captives were polluted because they had killed their mother,
and said that they would have to be puriﬁed in the sea along with the statue (which
had been polluted by their presence) before they could be brought to sacriﬁce; and
she added that the king himself should remain in the temple during their absence
to purify it, and that the local people should be ordered to stay indoors to avoid
any danger of pollution. On arriving at the shore at the lonely spot where Orestes’
ship had been secretly moored, Iphigeneia told the guards to keep at a distance
while she performed the puriﬁcations, and was thus able to escape out to sea unhin-
dered with the prisoners and the statue. Athena manifests herself to Thoas at the
end of the play to order him to make no attempt at pursuit, and she reveals that
the fugitives will arrive safely in Attica, and that Orestes will dedicate the statue
at Halai while Iphigeneia will become the priestess of Artemis at Brauron.210 In
connection with the cult of Artemis Tauropolis at Halai, which was supposed to
have been founded by Orestes, the priest used to graze a man’s throat with a sword
in a rite imitative of the human sacriﬁce that had once been performed by Iphigeneia,
but would restrict himself to drawing a single drop of blood.211
According to Attic tradition, Iphigeneia served Artemis at Brauron, a town on
the east coast of Attica, until the end of her days, and was buried there after her
death (although other places, including Megara, also claimed to have her tomb). She

received cultic honours as a heroine at her Attic tomb, and it is reported that the
clothing of women who died in childbirth (a function that was of special concern
to her mistress Artemis) would be dedicated to her.212 The statue that had suppos-
edly been stolen from the land of the Taurians by herself and her brother could be
seen at Brauron in historical times; but as in the case of the Trojan Palladion, a
variety of places claimed to possess it. The Spartans alleged, for instance, that Orestes
had brought it to their city when he became king there, and identiﬁed it with their
ancient image of Artemis Orthia; or in an Italian version of the legend, Orestes was
said to have deposited it at Aricia in Latium.213
Hyginus records a tale in which Aigisthos is said to have had a son called ALETES, who
seized power at Mycenae during Orestes’ absence when a messenger falsely reported that he
and his companion had been sacriﬁced to Taurian Artemis. Elektra decided to travel to
Delphi to question the oracle about her brother’s fate, and happened to arrive there just as
Orestes and Iphigeneia were calling in after their escape from the land of the Taurians.
When the messenger who had previously brought the false message told Elektra that
Iphigeneia had killed her brother (as she might well have done as the priestess of Taurian
Artemis), she seized a ﬁrebrand from the altar and would have killed Iphigeneia if Orestes
himself had not intervened. After recognizing each other’s identity, Orestes and Elektra trav-
elled to Mycenae, where Orestes killed Aletes, and would also have killed Erigone, the other
child of Aigisthos and Klytaimnestra, if Artemis had not rescued her and installed her in
Attica as one of her priestesses.214
The marriage and death of Orestes, and the truncated reign 
of his son Teisamenos
By killing Aigisthos and recovering his paternal inheritance, Orestes gained control
of Mycenae and the section of the Argolid that was ruled from it; and according to
Pausanias’ account of the local history of the area, the rest of the Argolid fell under
his control also when Kylarabos, son of Sthenelos, who had become the sole ruler
of the other lands of the Argolid (see p. 335), died without leaving any children.
And he ﬁnally inherited Sparta, the other main Pelopid kingdom, when his uncle
Menelaos died without an heir.215
From the classical period onwards, it was generally accepted that Orestes married
HERMIONE, the only daughter of Helen and Menelaos, who bore him his son and
heir Teisamenos (i.e. Avenger, so named because Orestes had avenged the murder
of Agamemnon). It was accepted at the same time, however, that Hermione was
also married to Neoptolemos at some stage. According to the Odyssey, Menelaos
promised her to Neoptolemos at Troy, and fulﬁlled his promise after the war by
sending her away to him (see p. 490); it would seem that he was her only husband
in the original tradition.216 The earliest known source for her marriage to Orestes
is a lost play by Sophocles called the Hermione, which suggested that Menelaos had
promised her to Neoptolemos without realizing that his father-in-law Tyndareos
had given her to Orestes at Sparta during his absence. Menelaos took her away from
her husband after the war to deliver her to Neoptolemos in accordance with his
promise; but when Neoptolemos was killed at Delphi soon afterwards while trying
to exact reparation from Apollo for the death of his father (see p. 491), Hermione
— The returns of the Greeks —
514

was able to resume her marriage to Orestes, and bore him his son.217 In other
accounts, Neoptolemos asserted his claim to her by seizing her from Orestes, who
retaliated by ambushing him at Delphi or arranging for him to be murdered there
(see p. 491).
In Euripides’ Andromache, the only surviving play on the theme, we are told that Hermione
married Neoptolemos as her ﬁrst husband and went to live with him in his grandfather’s
kingdom in southern Thessaly. Because the marriage proved to be childless, she grew increas-
ingly jealous of her husband’s concubine Andromache, who had borne him a son (here
unnamed, usually Molossos, see p. 490), and even imagined that Andromache was using
magic to render her barren. So while Neoptolemos was absent on a trip to Delphi, she and
her father Menelaos (who had come from Sparta for that purpose) set out to kill Andromache
and her son, causing her to send her son away and take refuge at the shrine of Thetis; but
Menelaos gained hold of her son and prised her away from her place of sanctuary by threat-
ening to kill him. He and his daughter would then have killed Andromache and her son
alike if Peleus, the grandfather of Neoptolemos, had not made an opportune appearance and
rescued them. Menelaos then made a hasty departure, leaving Hermione to worry about the
reaction of Neoptolemos when he returned to hear of the plot. Orestes, who had been
betrothed to her previously, happened to call in at this time as he was travelling north to
consult the oracle at Dodona; and on learning of her predicament, he offered to take her
away with him, explaining that he had already taken measures to ensure that Neoptolemos
would be killed at Delphi. For he hated Neoptolemos for having taken Hermione as his
wife when he himself was betrothed to her. As might be gathered from this summary,
Hermione is not an appealing character in this play and her father is utterly contemptible.218
It is generally agreed in subsequent sources that Hermione bore no children to
Neoptolemos during their brief marriage. Orestes for his part was said to have fathered an
illegitimate son by his half-sister Erigone, namely Penthilos, who founded colonies on Lesbos
and the adjoining mainland, and was the mythical ancestor of the Lesbian noble family of
the Penthilidai.
Orestes lived to an advanced age, seventy or even ninety in some accounts, until he
ﬁnally died from a snake-bite at Oresteion in Arcadia.219 According to Pausanias,
the Delphic oracle had instructed him to leave Mycenae to settle in Arcadia when
it was under the rule of Aipytos, son of Hippothoon (see p. 549).220 Tradition
claimed that he was initially buried in or near Tegea in southern Arcadia, but was
later reburied at Sparta, where his bones could be seen in historical times.221
Herodotus tells how this reburial was supposed to have come about in the sixth century BC.
After repeatedly failing to conquer the city of Tegea, the Spartans sought the advice of the
Delphic oracle, which told them that they would be victorious if the bones of Orestes were
brought home to Sparta; and when they consulted the oracle once again after failing to ﬁnd
the bones, it declared that the bones were lying in a place where two winds blew under
strong constraint, and where blow was struck on blow and woe on woe. The meaning of
the oracle remained a mystery until a Spartan agent called Lichas happened to call in at a
smithy in Tegea while some iron was being hammered out. When the smith remarked to
him that he had discovered a huge cofﬁn, ten feet long, while digging a well in the court-
yard outside, Lichas reﬂected on the work that was being carried out in front of him, and
suddenly realized that the oracle must have been referring to a smithy, and that the remains
in the cofﬁn would therefore be those of Orestes. For the ‘winds’ mentioned in the oracle

were the blasts of air that issued from the bellows of the forge, and the ‘blows’ were those
of the hammer on the anvil, and the ‘woes’ were those that would be inﬂicted by the iron
that was being hammered out (evidently to make weapons of war). So Lichas arranged for
the bones to be transferred to Sparta, and Tegea fell under the sway of Sparta soon after-
wards just as the oracle had predicted.222
TEISAMENOS, the son of Orestes, was the last Pelopid to hold power at Argos
and Sparta. He reigned as his father’s successor until he was displaced by the
Heraklids (see p. 290), who either killed him in battle or forced him into exile by
defeating him in battle. In the latter case, he withdrew to Achaea in the northern
Peloponnese with his sons and followers, but was killed soon afterwards when he
became embroiled in a war with the rulers of the land; his followers were victorious,
however, and the land was ruled by his sons and descendants thereafter (see 
further on p. 407). According to Achaean tradition, he was buried at the Achaean
city of Helike until the Spartans took his bones home to Sparta at the order of the
Delphic oracle.223

THE ATLANTIDS, THE 
ASOPIDS AND THE ARCADIAN 
ROYAL FAMILY

T
hree major heroic families remain to be considered, the Atlantids, who were
descended from the seven daughters of Atlas, the Asopids, who were descended
from the many daughters of the Peloponnesian river-god Asopos, and ﬁnally the
Arcadian royal family. As in the case of the Pelopids, the ﬁrst two families are of
especial interest in relation to the origin and ancestral background of leading ﬁgures
in the Trojan War. The family of Helen at Sparta and the family of Priam and Paris
at Troy were brought together into the same genealogical system as two different
branches of the Atlantid family (along with the Pelopids indeed, through a female
line); and in the posthomeric tradition at least, the two greatest warriors in the
Greek expeditionary force, Achilles and Aias (Ajax), were bracketed together as
cousins of common Asopid descent. Both families were quite extensive, however,
and will be considered in their full extent. The daughters of Atlas are also of some
interest in their own right in their common nature as the Pleiades. The Arcadian
royal family, which was descended from Pelasgos, the earthborn ﬁrst man of that
mountainous region, was rather similar in character to the Athenian royal family in
so far as few of its members played any major role in heroic saga and it was primarily
associated with a distinctive body of local legend.
THE ATLANTIDS
Atlas and his seven daughters, the Pleiades
Atlas, a son of the Titan Iapetos (see p. 49), managed to father a sizeable family
even though he had to hold up the heavens; for his wife Pleione, daughter of
Okeanos, bore him seven notable daughters, who were of twofold signiﬁcance. Under
their collective name of the Pleiades, they were identiﬁed with the seven stars of
the splendid star-cluster of that name in the constellation of the Bull; and under
their individual names, they were of genealogical importance as the founders of the
various branches of one of the great families of heroic mythology, the family of 
the Atlantids. All but one of them bore children to major gods; and one, Maia,
even became the mother of an Olympian god. Although we will be concerned

CHAPTER FIFTEEN
517

primarily with the heroic lines that they founded through their various liaisons, we
will begin with the myths that were associated with them in their other nature as
star-maidens.
In ancient and modern folklore alike, stars gathered together in conspicuous
clusters are commonly identiﬁed either as maidens or as animals of one kind or
another. Both ideas came to be applied to the stars of the Pleiades in ancient times,
for the Greeks liked to believe that they were the daughters of Atlas (a notion
already attested in Hesiod’s Works and Days1), while the Romans called them the
Septentriones, that is to say the seven plough-oxen. The ancient Greek name for the
star-cluster came to be applied to the daughters of Atlas when they were identiﬁed
with the stars; and the traditional name of their mother, Pleione, was also secondary
to that of the star-cluster, for it was plainly devised to enable the name of the
Pleiades to be interpreted as a matronymic. The astral myths of the Pleiades fall
into two groups, some explaining how the daughters of Atlas (who are regarded as
a group of maidens in this connection) came to be transferred to the heavens, and
others explaining why one of the Pleiades shines less brightly than the others.
Since the constellation of Orion rises as the Pleiades set, Orion seems to pursue
them across the sky. It was explained accordingly that Orion had once encountered
them as they were passing through Boeotia (his original homeland, see p. 561) with
their mother Pleione, and had pursued them all in the hope of raping Pleione; but
when the chase had continued for ﬁve (or seven) years, Zeus took pity on the maidens
and transferred them to the heavens, where the pursuit is represented in the stars.2
Or in a somewhat different version, when Orion set out to rape the maidens them-
selves, causing them to pray to the gods for help, Zeus saved them by turning them
into doves (peleiades) and removing them to the stars.3
A wholly different story was devised to provide a joint explanation for the origin of the
Pleiades and of the Hyades, another star-cluster in Taurus made up of ﬁve stars that outline
the face of the Bull. It is suggested in this connection that the Pleiades were not the only
children of Atlas, but were members of a larger family along with ﬁve other sisters and a
brother called HYAS. When Hyas was killed by a lion (or snake, or boar) during a hunting-
trip in Libya, ﬁve of his sisters were so overwhelmed by their grief that they soon died of
a broken heart, arousing the pity of Zeus, who placed them in the sky as the Hyades; and
when the seven remaining sisters also died after a lapse of time, Zeus transferred them to
the same region of the sky as the Pleiades. The Hyades were named after their brother
because they had shown the greatest grief for him, and the other sisters were called the
Pleiades because there were more (pleious) of them.4
According to a another suggestion, as recorded in some stray verses from Aeschylus, Zeus
transferred the seven daughters of Atlas to the sky because he pitied them for the sorrow that
they felt for their father (who had to perform the painful duty of holding up the sky);5 or
according to the Hellenistic poetess Moiro, the Pleiades had been doves during their earthly
life, and had earned the gratitude of Zeus by bringing ambrosia to him from the streams of
Ocean when he was an infant.6 Stories like these could be made up almost at will.
Although tradition stated that there were seven stars in the Pleiades, this was a
merely conventional number since more stars can be distinguished and six are
brighter than all the rest. To explain why one of the seven stars should be less radiant,
— The Atlantids, Asopids and Arcadians —
518

it was suggested that the Pleiad Merope hides her light because she is ashamed at
having been the only sister to have married a mortal (i.e. Sisyphos, see below).7 Or
else another of the sisters, Elektra, was so distressed to behold the destruction of Troy
(which was ruled by descendants of hers, see below) that she covered her face and has
been barely visible ever since; or else she abandoned her sisters altogether to become
a comet, an idea inspired by the thought that the tail of a comet (i.e. long-haired star,
aste¯r kome¯te¯s) resembles the loosened hair of a woman in mourning.8
To pass on to the second aspect of the mythology of the daughters of Atlas, 
their genealogical function as founders of heroic families or mothers of notable chil-
dren, two of them were founders of major families whose histories have yet to be
traced, namely Elektra as the progenitor of the Trojan royal line, and Taygete as
the progenitor of the early Spartan royal line. Another sister, Alkyone, is also of
some signiﬁcance in heroic genealogy as the ancestor of some important ﬁgures in
Theban myth and also of the main Euboean royal line. We will start, however, 
with the other sisters who will require briefer consideration. Through Sterope
and Merope, two heroic families that have already been discussed, the Pelopids and
the Corinthian royal family, were provided with an Atlantid genealogy through the
female line; Maia was the mother of Hermes; and Kelaino had no child of any
signiﬁcance.9
Maia and her divine son, and the three lesser 
Atlantid families
(i) An exceptional destiny was reserved for MAIA, who became the mother of an
Olympian god. She lived a secluded life in a cave on Mt Kyllene in Arcadia, where
Zeus visited her secretly at night and fathered the god Hermes by her. Since Hermes
was a precocious infant who set off to steal the cattle of Apollo on the ﬁrst day of
his life and left home forever on the second, Maia had little opportunity to devote
any motherly care to him.10 According to her only other legend, Zeus asked her to
rear another Arcadian child of his, Arkas, after the premature death of his mother
Kallisto (see p. 541). Maia would doubtless have been something more than an
ordinary mortal in the earliest tradition; the Homeric Hymn to Hermes refers to her
as a nymph. The Odyssey mentions her as the mother of Hermes without saying
anything about her origin.11
(ii) If the highest destiny was reserved for Maia, the lowest was reserved for
MEROPE, who was the only sister to enter into a union with a mortal; for she
became the wife of Sisyphos, the founder of the early Corinthian royal line (see 
p. 430).12 She was the mother of Glaukos and grandmother of the great Bellerophon.
(iii) According to one tradition at least, STEROPE (or Asterope), bore Oinomaos,
king of Pisa, to the war-god Ares.13 As we have already seen (pp. 503–4), Oinomaos
was the father-in-law of Pelops, who established himself in the Peloponnese by
winning his daughter Hippodameia along with his kingdom in a deadly bridal-
contest. Through his children by Hippodameia, Pelops founded the important 
family of the Pelopids, which included Agamemnon and Menelaos among its
members. By classing Oinomaos as a son of Sterope, the framers of the Atlantid
genealogies drew the Pelopids into the same genealogical system as the Spartan and

Trojan royal families, the other families that played the leading role in the events
that led up to the Trojan War. Since the local tradition in Oinomaos’ native area
claimed that his mother was a local eponym called Harpina (see p. 504), Sterope
sometimes came to be described as his wife rather than as his mother.14 He was
said to have been a son of Ares in either case, as was appropriate for such a noto-
riously brutal man.
(iv) KELAINO aroused the desire of Poseidon and bore him an obscure son called
Lykos, of whom nothing is recorded beyond the fact that his father transferred him
to the Isles of the Blessed and rendered him immortal.15
Eurypylos, a primordial king of Cyrene in North Africa, was sometimes said to have been
a further product of this liaison.16 He was reigning at the time when Apollo brought the
nymph Kyrene to the area (see p. 152); and since he had promised to surrender the kingdom
to anyone who could kill a savage lion that was bringing terror to the land, he handed it
over to Kyrene after she achieved that feat.17 It may be remembered that Apollo had fallen
in love with her after seeing her wrestling with a lion in her native Thessaly. According to
Pindar, the Libyan god Triton assumed the form of Eurypylos when he manifested himself
to the Argonauts (see p. 396).18
(v) ALKYONE became a mistress of Poseidon like Kelaino and bore him twin sons
called Hyrieus and Hyperes. HYRIEUS was the eponymous founder of the city of
Hyria in eastern Boeotia. He married a nymph called Klonia and fathered two notable
sons by her, Lykos and Nykteus, who settled at Thebes and gained considerable inﬂu-
ence and power there as was described in Chapter 9 (see pp. 302ff); Antiope, the
daughter of Nykteus, was the mother of Zethos and Amphion, who ruled Thebes for
a period (see p. 305).19 According to a conﬂicting tradition that presents Hyrieus as
being childless and indeed wifeless, three visiting gods provided him with a son,
Orion, by most unconventional means (see p. 561). The mythical builders Trophonios
and Agamedes constructed a treasure-house for him at Hyria, and were caught out by
him when they tried to steal from it afterwards (see p. 559).
HYPERES, the other son (or other main son) of Alkyone, was the progenitor of 
the most important ruling family in Euboea. His daughter ARETHOUSA had inter-
course with Poseidon beside the Euripos, the narrow straits that separate Boeotia 
from the island of Euboea, and bore him a son ABAS, who was the eponymous ﬁrst
ruler of the Abantes of Euboea.20 These are mentioned in the Iliad as the people who
were commanded at Troy by Abas’ grandson Elephenor, a race of swift-running
warriors who wore their hair long and were always eager to rend the chest-armour 
of their adversaries with their ash-shafted spears.21 Abas was succeeded by his son
CHALKODON, who was said to have been killed in battle by Amphitryon when 
he led an army across to Boeotia to try to exact a tribute from the Thebans; his 
tomb could be seen at Teumessos in Boeotia, beside the road that led from Thebes 
to the shortest crossing to Euboea opposite Chalkis.22 According to the Iliad,
ELEPHENOR, the leader of the Euboeans at Troy, was killed in battle by Agenor, a
son of the Trojan nobleman Antenor.23 Before setting off to the war, he offered refuge
to Akamas and Demophon, the two sons of Theseus, after their father’s throne was
seized by Menestheus (see p. 361). Euboea was rarely of much signiﬁcance in heroic
— The Atlantids, Asopids and Arcadians —
520

myth. Io was said to have called in at the island during her wanderings as a cow (see
p. 231); Herakles fought his ﬁnal campaign there (see p. 283); and Nauplios lit false
beacons at the southern end of the island to lure many of the returning Greeks to
their destruction after the Trojan War (see p. 485).
Alkyone was sometimes credited with some lesser children in addition to Hyrieus and
Hyperes, namely Anthas, who is mentioned as the eponymous founder of Anthedon in
Boeotia and of Antheia in Achaea,24 and a daughter Aithousa, who bore Eleuther, the epony-
mous founder of Eleutherai, to Apollo.25
The history of the Trojan royal family
(vi) The Trojan royal family was descended from ELEKTRA through her son DAR-
DANOS. She bore him to Zeus along with another son, Iasion (or Eetion), on the
island of Samothrace in the north-eastern corner of the Aegean.26 When Iasion (or
Eetion) grew up, Zeus struck him with a thunderbolt for presuming to engage in a
love affair with the goddess Demeter, or for committing some act of sacrilege against
her (see further on p. 132). In his sorrow at his brother’s fate, Dardanos decided to
leave the island of his birth to settle on the mainland nearby. Since boats had not yet
been invented, he improvised a means of transport by setting out to sea on inﬂated
hides or a raft.27 An alternative tradition suggested that he had to take to the sea to
escape the great ﬂood.28 He drifted across to the closest point on the Asian coast, at
the Troad in the north-western corner of Asia Minor. The region was under the rule
of the native-born ﬁrst king of the land, TEUKROS, who offered a friendly welcome
to the newcomer, granting his daughter Bateia to him as a wife along with a share of
the kingdom. Teukros was a son of Skamandros, the god of the main river of the
Troad (see p. 42), who had fathered him by a nymph of Mt Ida.29
According to an alternative account which became popular in Hellenistic and later times,
Teukros was himself of Greek origin as an immigrant from Crete. In that case, he had crossed
over to Asia with his father Skamandros and some Cretan followers; and since an oracle had
advised them to settle where they were attacked during the night by ‘the earthborn’, they
settled in the Troad after discovering that mice had gnawed at their bow-strings and the
leather of their weapons as they were camping there overnight. Teukros had then named
the main river of the area after his father. This story provided an explanation for the origin
of the local cult of Apollo Smintheus (of the mice); the Iliad already mentions that the god
was honoured under that title at a shrine on Tenedos just of the coast of the Troad.30 There
was also an Athenian tradition that suggested that Teukros had emigrated from Attica.31
As regards the geography of the land, Troy (Troia in Greek) is properly the name of the
territory, while Ilion (Ilium in Latinized form) is the name of its main city; but the name
Troy may also be applied in a looser sense to the city, in both ancient and modern usage.
The Troad (Troas) is an alternative name for the region of Troy.
Since Teukros had no male children, Dardanos inherited the entire territory after
his death, and named it Dardania after himself. He founded a settlement on Mt
Ida, the mountain range to the east of the Trojan plain. Although the Iliad credits
him with only a single son, ERICHTHONIOS, later sources from the Hesiodic

Catalogue onwards often add a second son, Ilos (an insigniﬁcant doublet of the Ilos
who was the eponymous founder of Ilion, see below).32 After succeeding to the
throne, Erichthonios moved down from the hill-country to the Trojan plain, where
– so the Iliad tells us – he pastured three thousand mares in the marshlands and
became the wealthiest of mortals.33 He married Astyoche, a daughter of Simoeis
(the god of the second main river of the Troad), and fathered a single son by her,
TROS, the eponym of the land of Troy. Tros succeeded his father as king and
married Kallirhoe, daughter of Skamandros, who bore him three sons, Ilos, Assarakos
and Ganymedes.34
GANYMEDES spent little time in his native land since he was soon abducted
to Olympos on account of his beauty to serve as a cupbearer to Zeus and the other
gods. His fate is mentioned in the Iliad, which states that the gods snatched him
away to live in their company as the wine-pourer of Zeus because he was excep-
tionally beautiful, the most beautiful of all mortal men.35 Or according to another
early source, the Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite, Zeus caused him to be swept up to
heaven by a whirlwind, to the great distress of his father, who had no idea where
he had been taken. Zeus took pity on Tros, however, and not only sent Hermes to
tell him that Ganymedes would be living among the gods as an immortal, but
presented him with some divine horses to compensate him for his loss.36 These
horses later became a source of trouble, as was so often the case with divine gifts,
when Herakles sought to acquire them (see p. 275). Another tradition suggested
that Zeus presented a golden vine to Tros (or to his grandson Laomedon) as compen-
sation for Ganymedes (see p. 472).37
In what has come to be the most familiar account of the abduction, Zeus sent an
eagle (his special bird) to carry off Ganymedes, or else transformed himself into an
eagle for that purpose.38 This idea ﬁrst surfaces in Hellenistic times; in the earliest
artistic representations on red-ﬁgure vases, Zeus is shown performing the abduction
in his usual form. Although it is stated from the beginning that Ganymedes was
raised up to heaven because of his beauty, there is no indication that Zeus was
thought to have become his lover in the earliest tradition. From the classical period
onwards, however, it seems to have been commonly assumed that Zeus abducted
him or arranged his abduction with this end in view, as is ﬁrst indicated by Theognis
and Pindar.39 It may be noted in this connection that the word catamite (catamitus
in the original Latin) was derived from a Latin form of Ganymedes’ name.
ILOS, the eldest of the three sons of Tros, succeeded to the throne and founded
the city of Ilion (often loosely called Troy), which became the seat of rule of the
kings of Troy from that time forth. The remaining brother, ASSARAKOS, founded
the junior branch of the royal family, which was based outside the city on Mt Ida.
Kapys, the son of Assarakos, was the father of Anchises, who aroused the love of
Aphrodite and fathered the great Aineias by her (see p. 200).40
According to a story that was apparently modelled on the Theban foundation
legend, Ilos chose the site of his city by taking a cow as his guide. For he visited
neighbouring Phrygia at some point in his reign and won the wrestling contest in
some games that were held there by the king; and in addition to the ordinary prize
of ﬁfty youths and ﬁfty girls, the king gave him a dappled cow at the bidding of
— The Atlantids, Asopids and Arcadians —
522

an oracle, and told him to found a city wherever it ﬁrst lay down. So he followed
the cow until it sank to the ground on the hill of Phrygian Ate, an eminence on
the Trojan plain, and chose that as the site of his new city of Ilion.41 Or in a some-
what different version, Apollo granted an oracle to Ilos himself, telling him to found
the city where he saw one of his cattle fall to the ground as he was driving the herd
to neighbouring Mysia.42 After observing the appointed sign, he prayed to Zeus 
for conﬁrmation; and when he emerged from his tent on the following morning, he
found that a wooden efﬁgy (xoanon) of Pallas Athene had fallen from the sky during
the night and was lying on the ground outside.43 This statue, which was known as
the Palladion (i.e. efﬁgy of Pallas Athene; Palladium in Latin form), would serve 
as a protective talisman for Ilion; Ilos raised a magniﬁcent temple to Athena to
house it, where it remained until Odysseus stole it in the last stages of the Trojan
War to deprive the Trojans of its protective power (see p. 472). The tomb of Ilos
is mentioned in the Iliad as a landmark on the Trojan plain.44
Ilos and his wife Eurydike, daughter of Adrastos, had a single son LAOMEDON,
who succeeded to the throne.45 Laomedon had a large family of sons and daughters
of whom three alone need concern us, Tithonos, Priam and Hesione. Tithonos was
famous as the lover of the dawn-goddess Eos (see p. 47), and as the father of Memnon
(see p. 468); we will return to the other two in connection with the downfall of
their father. Laomedon was a powerful but heedlessly arrogant ruler who brought
disaster on himself and his people by two dishonourable acts of ingratitude, ﬁrst
toward Apollo and Poseidon and then toward Herakles. The two gods were once
obliged to serve him as labourers for a year as a penalty for having rebelled against
Zeus; or else they submitted themselves to him of their own accord to test whether
he was really as presumptuous as he was reputed to be. While they were with him,
they fortiﬁed Ilion with massive walls on the agreement that they would receive a
fee for their work; but when the work was completed, Laomedon not only refused
to pay them but treated them in a most insulting manner, threatening to sell them
into slavery and cut off their ears. To punish the king for his duplicity, Apollo sent
a plague while Poseidon sent a ﬂood and a fearsome sea-monster to prey on the
inhabitants of the land.46 The arrival of this monster set in course the train of events
that would lead Laomedon to commit his second act of ingratitude. The Trojans
learned from oracles that they would be delivered from the monster if the king
would expose his daughter HESIONE to it; so he fastened her to some rocks by
the sea-shore, where Herakles happened to catch sight of her as he was sailing past
Troy on his way to the land of the Amazons (or was sailing to Colchis with the
Argonauts). As has already been recounted, he promised to save Hesione in return
for the divine horses that had been presented to Tros as compensation for the loss
of Ganymedes; but when he tried to claim his reward after fulﬁlling the task,
Laomedon refused to hand over the horses (or tried to substitute mortal ones). So
he returned at a later date with a sizeable force of allies and sacked Ilion for the
ﬁrst time in its history, killing Laomedon and all his sons apart from the youngest,
PRIAM (see further on p. 276). He offered Hesione to Telamon, king of Salamis,
who had fought as his ally, and allowed her to choose whomever she wished from
among the captives. She released her only surviving brother, ransoming him with

her veil; he was originally called Podarkes, but was now given his familiar name of
Priam because she ‘purchased’ him in this way (as though his name were derived
from priamai, to buy).47 For a more detailed account of Herakles’ adventures at Troy,
see pp. 275–6.
Priam succeeded to the throne and continued to rule at Troy until the city was
burned down and he himself was killed at the end of the Trojan War; something
has already been said about him and his large family in connection with the culmi-
nating episode in the history of Troy (see especially pp. 451ff and 474ff). Owing
to Homer’s ﬁne portrait of him, in which he is presented as a noble and sympa-
thetic character, it is possible to imagine him as a living individual, in contrast to
his predecessors. He makes his most telling appearances in book 3 of the Iliad, as
he talks to Helen and the Trojan elders on the ramparts of the city, and in the ﬁnal
book, when he visits Achilles to seek the return of Hektor’s body.48
The early Spartan royal family
(vii) The Spartan royal family was descended from the Atlantid Taygete, who bore
LAKEDAIMON, the eponym of the Peloponnesian province of that name, to her
divine lover Zeus.49
The south-eastern province of the Peloponnese, which adjoined Arcadia and the Argolid to
the north and Messenia to the west, was known to the Greeks as Lakedaimo¯n, as was its main
city also. Sparta was an alternative name for the city, with poetic and patriotic overtones. The
name Sparta has also come to be applied in a looser sense to the territory as a whole. Laconia
(or Laconica, cf. ge¯ Lakonike¯ in Greek) was a Latin name for Lakedaimon.
Taygete was the eponym of Taygetos, the towering mountain range that divides
Laconia from Messenia. The only proper myth recorded for her, the tale recounted
in Chapter 8 in which she was said to have dedicated the Cerynitian hind to Artemis
after the goddess saved her from being raped by Zeus (see p. 260), does not accord
well with the usual tradition that makes her the founder of a royal line through a
son borne to Zeus. Her son LAKEDAIMON married Sparta, the eponym of the
main city of the land, who was a daughter of Eurotas, the eponym of the main river
of the land, and a granddaughter (or great-granddaughter) of Lelex, the earthborn
ﬁrst ruler of the land. Lakedaimon and Sparta had a daughter Eurydike, who became
the wife of Akrisios, king of Argos (see p. 238), and a son Amyklas, who was the
eponymous founder of Amyklai, an ancient town on the Eurotas about three miles
south-east of Sparta. Amyklas was succeeded by his son Kynortas or Kynortes (either
directly or after the death of an elder brother Argalos). Hyakinthos, the short-lived
Laconian favourite of Apollo (see p. 155), is the only early member of the family
to be of any real interest as a mythological ﬁgure; having originated in prehellenic
cult rather than in heroic mythology, he was inserted into the royal line as a son
of Amyklas, doubtless because Amyklai was his most important cultic centre.50
Kynortas was succeeded by his son Oibalos, another nonentity like himself; 
and with the sons of Oibalos, we at last enter the realm of major heroic myth.
Oibalos had three sons, his presumptive heir TYNDAREOS (whom we have already
— The Atlantids, Asopids and Arcadians —
524

encountered as the protector of the young Agamemnon and Menelaos, see p. 508,
and as the putative father of Helen, see p. 438), and Hippokoon and Ikarios.
HIPPOKOON, who was of illegitimate birth in some accounts, had a large family
of twelve or twenty sons, and seized the throne with their support, driving Tyndareos
into exile.51 In one version of the legend, he expelled Ikarios along with his brother,
and the two of them sought refuge at the court of Thestios (see p. 413) at Pleuron
in Aetolia. They repaid their host by assisting him in a border war and so helping
him to extend his power into neighbouring Acarnania (where Ikarios settled as a
local ruler according to one tradition).52 Or in another account, Ikarios helped
Hippokoon to expel Tyndareos and remained with him in Sparta afterwards; in that
case, Tyndareos lived closer to home during the period of his exile, seeking refuge
at Pellana in Laconia or with Aphareus, king of Messenia.53 Hippokoon and his sons
ﬁnally provoked their own downfall by angering Herakles, who mounted an expedi-
tion against Sparta and killed every one of them (see further on pp. 278–9).
Tyndareos was then recalled by the victorious hero; and Ikarios was usually said to
have lived with him at Sparta after he regained his rightful throne.
To start with the younger brother, IKARIOS married a nymph called Periboia
(or a woman otherwise named), who bore him various children of whom PEN-
ELOPE, the future wife of Odysseus, was by far the most important.54 It is no
surprise to discover that the most memorable myths of Ikarios should be connected
with Penelope and her marriage. In one account, as we have seen, Tyndareos inter-
ceded with Ikarios on Odysseus’ behalf in return for advice on how to avoid trouble
from Helen’s suitors (see p. 440); or else Odysseus’ father Laertes interceded on his
son’s behalf;55 but a more picturesque legend suggested that Ikarios arranged a
bridal-race for Penelope’s suitors in the streets of Sparta, hence the name of one
such street Aphetais (Leaving-Street), which was where the defeated suitors were left
behind by the victorious Odysseus.56 According to another local tale, which was put
forward to explain the origin of a statue of Aidos (Shame or Modesty personiﬁed)
on the road north from Sparta, Ikarios was distressed to think that his beloved
daughter would be living far away from him on Ithaca, and tried to pursuade
Odysseus to settle down in Laconia; and when Odysseus proved unwilling, he begged
Penelope to remain with him, even following after her in his chariot when she set
off for Ithaca with her husband. Odysseus ﬁnally lost patience and told Penelope
that she must either accompany him of her own free will or agree to return home
with her father. Hesitating to speak aloud, she covered her face with her veil, and
Ikarios divined her meaning and allowed her to pass on her way; and he commem-
orated the incident by raising a statue to Aidos at the spot.57
TYNDAREOS married LEDA, a daughter of his former host Thestios, and came
to preside over a mixed family consisting partly of his own children and partly of chil-
dren who were fathered by Zeus on his wife. Helen, as we have seen (p. 438), was
either one of Leda’s children by Zeus or else her adoptive child as the daughter of
Zeus and Nemesis. Leda also bore three legitimate daughters to her husband, namely
Klytaimnestra (Clytemnestra in Latin), who became the wife of Agamemnon, and
Timandra, who married Echemos (an Arcadian king who was best remembered for
having delayed the return of the Heraklids, see p. 288), and Phylonoe, of whom
nothing is recorded beyond the fact that she was rendered immortal by Artemis.58

There was disagreement about the origin of Kastor and Polydeukes (Pollux in
Latin), the two sons of Leda. The Odyssey suggests that both were children of Zeus,
while the Hesiodic Catalogue describes them as sons of Tyndareos;59 but according to
Pindar and the standard later tradition, they were of mixed paternity since Leda
conceived Kastor to Tyndareos and Polydeukes to Zeus on the same night.60
The twins were known as the Dioskouroi (Sons of Zeus, Dioscuri in Latin form)
irrespectively throughout antiquity.
According to a tale which can be traced back to Stesichorus, Tyndareos once offended
Aphrodite by forgetting her when he was offering sacriﬁces to all the gods, and she reacted
by causing his daughters (i.e. Klytaimnestra, Timandra and his putative daughter Helen) to
abandon their husbands for other men. So Helen eloped with Paris, Klytaimnestra embarked
on a love affair with Aigisthos with fatal effect for her husband (see p. 508), and Timandra
abandoned Echemos for Phyleus (presumably the son of Augeias of that name, see p. 261).61
When Helen grew up to become the most beautiful woman in Greece, she attracted
suitors from all parts of the Greek world. Through a process of selection that has
already been described (see p. 439), Tyndareos (or his sons, or Helen herself) chose
Menelaos, son of Atreus, as her husband. Menelaos, who was of Pelopid descent, had
no kingdom of his own, but beneﬁted from the support of his brother Agamemnon,
the rich and powerful king of Mycenae. He was already living in Sparta for reasons
explained on pp. 507–8, and now settled down at the court of Tyndareos with his
bride. When the early death of the Dioskouroi (who were killed before the Trojan
War, see below) deprived the king of his only male heirs, he adopted his son-in-law
Menelaos as his successor, and the crown passed out of the Atlantid line. The
kingdom remained under Pelopid rule for two generations thereafter, passing to
Menelaos’ nephew Orestes, who thus came to rule over Sparta as well as his native
Argolid (see p. 514), and thence to Teisamenos, son of Orestes. Teisamenos was
ﬁnally displaced by the Heraklids (see p. 516), who could lay claim to Sparta on the
ground that Herakles had placed Tyndareos on the throne as a result of his campaign
against Hippokoon. In one account, indeed, Herakles explicitly told Tyndareos that
the kingdom was to be held in trust for his descendants.
The Dioskouroi, and their conﬂict with the sons of Aphareus
From this branch of the Atlantid family, only the DIOSKOUROI remain to be
considered. Inseparable from the time of their birth, they grew up to become two of
the greatest heroes in Greece during the period immediately preceding the Trojan
War; but as the result of a quarrel with some Messenian cousins, they were killed
before they could ascend to the Spartan throne or ﬁght at Troy. Kastor was particu-
larly noted for his horsemanship and Polydeukes for his prowess as a boxer.62 Along
with most of the main heroes of their generation, they sailed with the Argonauts and
joined the hunt for the Calydonian boar; in the course of the former adventure,
Polydeukes applied his boxing skills to kill the murderous pugilist Amykos (see 
p. 386).63 A reference to Polydeukes in a partially preserved poem by Alcman
suggests that there was also an early tradition in which the Dioskouroi aided Herakles
— The Atlantids, Asopids and Arcadians —
526

in his campaign against Hippokoon.64 As well as appearing in a supporting role in
these joint adventures, the twins played a leading role in three legends of their 
own: they rescued the young Helen from Attica after she was abducted from Sparta
by Theseus (see p. 361), they abducted Hilaeira and Phoibe, two Messenian
princesses, and they became embroiled in a fatal conﬂict with Idas and Lynkeus, two
Messenian princes.
IDAS and LYNKEUS, known jointly as the Apharetidai, were the two sons of
Aphareus, who was ruling Messenia at this time in conjunction with his brother
Leukippos (see p. 422). In what was probably the earliest version of the story, they
quarrelled with the Dioskouroi as the result of a disagreement over some cattle.
According to the full account recorded by Apollodorus, the two sets of brothers had
joined together to rustle some cattle from Arcadia, and the trouble began when the
spoils were entrusted to Idas for division. For he cut a cow into four and proposed
that half of the spoils should go to the one who ate his portion ﬁrst, and the rest
to the one who ate his portion second; and he then devoured his own portion and
that of his brother too before anyone else had a chance. He claimed all of the cattle
as a result of this ruse and drove them away to Messenia with the help of his brother.
The Dioskouroi were unwilling to be deprived of their proper share through sharp
practice of this kind and hurried off in pursuit. On arriving in Messenia, they seized
all the cattle that had been stolen from Arcadia along with many others, and set
an ambush for Idas and Lynkeus; for the conclusion of the story, see below.65 Some
such tale was already recounted in the ﬁrst epic in the Trojan cycle, the Cypria. The
surviving summary is not very informative, however, merely stating that a ﬁght
broke out when the Dioskouroi were caught in the act as they were stealing some
cattle from Idas and Lynkeus.66 Pindar agrees that the quarrel arose over cattle, but
reports nothing further.67 Although it is quite possible that the early epic version
is preserved in Apollodorus’ fanciful tale of Idas’ deception and its aftermath, we
cannot be sure about the matter.
In another version of the story, the trouble arose because the Dioskouroi abducted
HILAEIRA and PHOIBE, the daughters of Leukippos, two Messenian princesses
who were betrothed to Idas and Lynkeus. Some accounts even suggest that the
Dioskouroi were invited to the wedding-feast when the sisters were due to marry
Idas and Lynkeus, and took advantage of the occasion to carry them off for them-
selves.68 Or in Theocritus’ account, Idas and Lynkeus pursued and confronted the
Dioskouroi after they had abducted their brides, and Lynkeus accused the twins of
having bribed Leukippos to hand over his daughters, even though they had been
promised to Idas and himself, by offering him gifts of cattle and mules.69 The story
varies to differing extents in other versions. There is a composite version, for instance,
in which Idas and Lynkeus reproached the Dioskouroi for not having paid a bride-
price to Leukippos for his daughters, and the twins then proceeded to remedy the
fault by driving off some cattle that belonged to the father of their accusers, so
provoking the fatal conﬂict between the two pairs of brothers.70
Although the surviving literary accounts are of Hellenistic and later origin, the story of the
abduction was clearly familiar by the sixth century BC, for it was depicted on the Amyklaian
throne71 and other works of art from that period; but even if the abduction itself ﬁgured in

early epic, it may not have carried the same implications in the early tradition, since we
cannot be sure that Idas (whose marriage to Marpessa is mentioned in the Iliad, see p. 153)
and his brother were originally thought to have been betrothed to the maidens. Polydeukes
took Phoibe as his wife and Kastor took Hilaeira; although some sources report a son for
each marriage, there is disagreement on their names and none are of any signiﬁcance.72 Under
their joint name of the Leukippides, Hilaeira and Phoibe were honoured as minor goddesses
at their sanctuary in Sparta, where they were served by virgin priestesses who were known
as Leukippides like themselves.73
Although the different accounts of the confrontation between the two sets of brothers
vary considerably in their details, it was commonly agreed that Kastor and the two
sons of Aphareus were killed and that Polydeukes was removed from the company
of mortals. Pindar and Apollodorus provide similar narratives which were probably
based on the early epic account in the Cypria. When the Dioskouroi tried to lay an
ambush for the sons of Aphareus in Messenia, they were foiled by the superhuman
eyesight of Lynkeus, who climbed the heights of Taygetos between Laconia and
Messenia to survey the entire Peloponnese. He ﬁnally observed that the twins were
hiding in Messenia inside a hollow oak-tree, apparently making use of his magical
vision to see through its trunk. This feature of the story (which is mentioned by
Pindar though not by Apollodorus) is already recorded in some surviving verses
from the Cypria. After rushing down to the tree with his brother, Idas inﬂicted a
fatal wound on Kastor, but the two brothers were then put to ﬂight by Polydeukes,
who pursued them to the burial-place of their father Aphareus. Although they tried
to repel him by uprooting their father’s gravestone and hurling it at his chest, he
contrived to press forward and killed Lynkeus with his spear; and Zeus then came
to his assistance by striking Idas with a thunderbolt.74
Polydeukes is regarded as a son of Zeus in this story while Kastor is a wholly
mortal son of Tyndareos. In Pindar’s account, Polydeukes returned to his fallen
brother to ﬁnd that he was on the point of death, and prayed to Zeus to be allowed
to die with him; but Zeus responded by offering him two choices, saying that he
could either enjoy full immortality on Olympos in accordance with his divine
parentage, or else share his immortality with his brother, so that each of them would
spend half of their time in the Underworld and the other half with the gods on
Olympos. Polydeukes chose the latter alternative without a moment’s hesitation. 
Or in Apollodorus’ narrative, in which Kastor had met an immediate death at the
hand of Idas, Polydeukes was brought to the ground by a stone that was hurled by
Lynkeus just before he was killed by him. Zeus carried Polydeukes up to heaven
after killing Idas with the thunderbolt, but he refused to accept immortality while
his brother Kastor lay dead. So Zeus allowed him to share his immortality with his
brother by arranging that both of them should live among the gods and among
mortals (i.e. in Hades) on alternate days. These events took place just before the
Greek forces assembled for the Trojan War; according to the Cypria, the Dioskouroi
entertained Paris when he ﬁrst arrived in Laconia, and became embroiled in this
conﬂict with Idas and Lynkeus shortly afterwards, around the time of Helen’s abduc-
tion.75 This would explain, of course, why they were unable to prevent Paris from
escaping with her.
— The Atlantids, Asopids and Arcadians —
528

Some authors alter the preceding pattern by suggesting that Kastor was killed by Lynkeus
rather than by Idas, or that Idas was killed by Polydeukes rather than by Zeus, but this 
makes little practical difference.76 In the version recorded by Hyginus, Idas and Lynkeus took
up their arms to try to recover the daughters of Leukippos after they were abducted by the
Dioskouroi. After Lynkeus was killed by Kastor in the ensuing ﬁght, Idas put all other
thoughts aside to attend to the burial of his brother; but this merely provided an occasion for
further confrontation since Kastor intervened to prevent him from raising a monument to
Lynkeus, saying that he had met with a thoroughly ignominious defeat. Idas was so angry that
he thrust his sword into Kastor’s thigh, inﬂicting a fatal wound; or in another version recorded
in the same source, he killed Kastor by pushing the monument over to crush him under it.
On hearing of Kastor’s fate, Polydeukes rushed to the site, killed Idas in single combat, and
then prayed that he should be allowed to share his own immortality with his brother.77 Or in
an exceptional account by Theocritus in which both of the Dioskouroi survive, Kastor
proposed that he and Lynkeus, as the two younger brothers, should settle the quarrel by single
combat so as to avoid unnecessary bloodshed. When Lynkeus lost two of his ﬁngers in the fray
and dropped his sword, he ran off towards his brother, who was lying by the tomb of
Aphareus; but Kastor sped after him and transﬁxed him with his sword. Idas leapt up in
response, seizing that memorial-stone from his father’s tomb, and would have hurled it at his
brother’s killer if Zeus had not prevented him by striking him dead with a thunderbolt. So
Kastor survived, as did Polydeukes, who had been no more than a spectator.78 For the other
major story associated with Idas, see pp. 153–4.
It was inevitably suggested in astral mythology that the Dioskouroi were raised to
the heavens to become the constellation of the Twins (Gemini); Zeus brought this
about because he wanted to commemorate their brotherly devotion.79 They were
honoured as gods, particularly in their native Sparta, and became increasingly
popular throughout the Greek world as protectors who could be appealed to in times
of danger, especially at sea. In the latter connection, they were sometimes identi-
ﬁed with the Kabeiroi or gods of Samothrace (see p. 220). They manifested
themselves in St Elmo’s ﬁre, an electrical discharge that plays around the masts of
ships during thunderstorms; as the early lyric poet Alcaeus expresses the matter,
they run up the mastheads shining bright from afar, bringing light to the 
black ship in the night of afﬂiction.80 The cult of the Dioskouroi was introduced
to Rome at a relatively early period; according to Roman tradition, a temple was
raised to them in the Forum in 484 BC in fulﬁlment of a vow that had been made
by Aulus Postumius at the battle of Lake Regillus. It was claimed, indeed, that the
Twins had appeared in person at the battle (c. 496), helping the Romans to victory
against the Latins by leading them in a cavalry charge.81 Kastor overshadowed his
brother for some reason at Rome, where the twins were quite often referred to as
the Castores.
THE ASOPIDS
The Asopid family was formed from the descendants of the Peloponnesian river-god
ASOPOS, whose waters ﬂowed to the sea on the northern coast of the peninsula to
the west of Corinth. Asopos and his wife Metope, a daughter of the river Ladon,
had many daughters who were abducted by Zeus and other gods to many different

parts of the Greek world, where they founded local lines through children borne to
their abductors or simply served as local eponyms. Although the family was quite
large overall, it is primarily of interest for the single branch of it that produced
Achilles and the greater Aias (Ajax). As the bravest and mightiest of the Greek
warriors at Troy, Achilles and Aias form a natural pair in much the same way as
Agamemnon and Menelaos; and it was doubtless for that reason that they came to
be classed as cousins, even though there is no suggestion in the Iliad that they were
related in any way, and it might be supposed in any case that they were originally
unrelated because they were connected with widely separate areas. When described
as cousins, they were said to have been grandsons of Aiakos, king of Aegina, and
great-grandsons of the Asopid Aigina, who was abducted to the island of that name
by Zeus. It was explained that their fathers Telamon and Peleus had been expelled
from Aegina for committing a murder within the family, and had settled in different
areas, Peleus in Thessaly in the north and Telamon at Salamis off the coast of Attica,
hence the widely separate birthplaces of Aias and Achilles. See Table 18. Formally
at least, the genealogy of Achilles remains consistent from the time of the Iliad,
which traces his ancestry to Peleus, Aiakos and Zeus;82 but it seems likely that
Peleus and Aiakos were originally of Thessalian birth, and that Aiakos was ﬁrst
transferred to Aegina when the common Asopid genealogy was devised for Aias and
Achilles. The myth of the abduction of Aigina, as developed in that connection,
then provided the model for numerous other stories in which daughters of Asopos
were said to have been carried abroad by one god or another. A sizeable family came
to be built up in this manner in the course of time, even if most of its added
members were arbitrarily invented eponyms of little general interest. We will
concentrate on Aigina’s branch of the family initially and primarily, before casting
a brief glance at the secondary branches.
Aigina, daughter of Asopos, and her son Aiakos
Zeus fell in love with AIGINA after seeing her by her father’s streams in the land
of Sicyon in the northern Peloponnese, and carried her off, taking her eastward past
Corinth and across the sea to an island in the Saronic Gulf between Argos and
Attica. On discovering that she had vanished, her father Asopos set off in search of
her, and visited Corinth ﬁrst to question its ruler, Sisyphos, who could see for miles
around from his towering citadel of Akrokorinthos. As it happened, the abduction
had indeed been observed by Sisyphos, who betrayed the secret to the river-god in
return for the creation of a spring on his acropolis. This turned out to be a dubious
bargain, however, since Zeus could hardly allow such an indiscretion to go unpun-
ished (see further on p. 431). Nor did Asopos gain any advantage from the
information, for when he tried to recover his daughter, Zeus hurled thunderbolts at
him to force him to return to his streams. As a consequence, so we are told, coals
could be collected from the Asopos from that time onward (although there is appar-
ently no sign of them nowadays).83
On arriving at Aegina, which had been known as Oinone or Oinopia until that
time, Zeus settled Aigina there as his mistress and renamed the island in her honour.
— The Atlantids, Asopids and Arcadians —
530

She bore him a single son, AIAKOS, who grew up to become the ﬁrst king of
Aegina.84 He had no one to rule over initially, either because the island had been
uninhabited before the arrival of his mother, or because Hera had caused the death
of the original population after learning that her husband had embarked on a love
affair with Aegina. In the latter case, the goddess achieved her aim by sending a
terrible plague or by sending a snake to poison the water-supplies.85 Aiakos prayed
to his father to send him some people to relieve his loneliness and provide him with
subjects to rule over, and Zeus granted his wish by transforming the local ants
(myrme¯kes) into human beings. This story was devised to account for the name and
origin of the Myrmidons, the Thessalian people who were ruled by his son Peleus
and commanded by Achilles at Troy; we are to understand that Peleus took some
of the Aiginetan ‘ant-people’ away with him when he departed into exile.86
Aiakos was a man of incomparable piety and righteousness. When the whole of
Greece was afﬂicted by a famine as a result of the murder of Stymphalos (see 
p. 549) or else of Androgeos (see p. 340), an oracle declared that Aiakos alone would
be capable of delivering the land from its barrenness if he were to offer prayers to
the gods (or to Zeus speciﬁcally) on behalf of all the Greeks.87 And whenever disputes
arose, Aiakos could be relied upon as a just arbitrator, as when he arbitrated between
Skeiron and Nisos over the Megarian succession (see p. 343).88 It was even claimed
that he arbitrated in disputes between the gods,89 even if no speciﬁc examples of
his activities in this regard have been preserved. His exceptional virtues were duly
acknowledged after his death when he was appointed to be one of the judges of the
dead or else the gate-keeper of Hades (see p. 122).90
Peleus and Telamon are exiled from Aegina for killing their 
half-brother Phokos
For all his high principles, Aiakos mismanaged his family affairs and became
estranged from his sons. He married Endeis, daughter of Cheiron (or Skeiron), who
bore him his two legitimate children, PELEUS and TELAMON; but he also fathered
a son out of wedlock by the Nereid Psamathe.91 On ﬁnding herself accosted by a
mortal, the sea-nymph tried to escape his embrace by turning herself into a seal
(pho¯ke¯), but he kept a ﬁrm hold on her and caused her to conceive a son, PHOKOS,
whom he reared as a member of his family.92 He was especially fond of Phokos and
showed him such favour that his wife and legitimate sons grew increasingly resentful,
until Peleus and Telamon eventually banded together to murder the intruder with
the encouragement of their mother. Although accounts differ on whether Peleus or
Telamon delivered the fatal blow or both did so jointly, it was generally agreed that
they conspired together to cause his death. According to the usual tradition, one or
the other killed Phokos by hurling a discus at his head while the three of them
were exercising together. Other versions of the legend in which they were said to
have killed him because they were jealous of his athletic prowess or simply by acci-
dent were plainly of secondary origin. Whatever the exact course of events, Aiakos
sent Peleus and Telamon into exile on hearing of the death of Phokos, and never
allowed them to set foot on Aegina again.93

As has been mentioned, Achilles states in the Iliad that he is the son of Peleus and grandson
of Aiakos, son of Zeus; but the Homeric epics are less informative about Aias, reporting
nothing about the descent of his father Telamon. It is never suggested in any way that
Achilles and Aias are related; and although the title of Aiakides (son or descendant of Aiakos)
is applied quite frequently to Achilles and Peleus,94 it is never applied to Aias or his half-
brother Teukros. There is thus every reason to suppose that Aias and Achilles and their
respective fathers had not yet been brought together into a common family. It is impossible
to tell exactly when the linkage was established. Pindar is the ﬁrst author to state explic-
itly that Telamon was a son of Aiakos (even if some surviving lines from an early epic, the
Alkmaionis, already imply that Telamon and Peleus were brothers by saying that they joined
together to murder Phokos).95 Although Homer mentions that Achilles’ grandfather Aiakos
was a son of Zeus like the Aiginetan of the later tradition, the mother of this Aiakos is left
unnamed; as was noted above, Peleus and Aiakos were probably regarded as being purely
Thessalian at this stage. If that is correct, the mother of Aiakos may possibly have been a
daughter of the Thessalian Asopos, which ﬂowed into the Malian Gulf in the very region
of Peleus’ kingdom.96
According to a local tradition at Aegina, Telamon once sailed back to the island in the
vain hope of persuading his father to allow him back, but Aiakos refused to allow him even
to set foot on the shore, and he was therefore obliged to pile up a mound in the sea so as
to speak from there (hence a feature of the local topography).97 Another local tradition, also
recorded by Pausanias, suggested that Aiakos had surrounded the island with reefs below
the waterline to protect it from its enemies98 (although one might have thought that he
would have asked his father to arrange such a matter). According to a legend recounted by
Pindar, Apollo and Poseidon summoned the help of Aiakos when they were building the
walls of Troy (see p. 523); for as a scholion explains, the city would surely have been impreg-
nable if its walls had been of wholly divine construction. After the walls were completed,
three snakes tried to leap on to the ramparts, but two of them fell back and died while only
one succeeded; and Apollo interpreted this omen by declaring that Troy would be seized at
Aiakos’ section of the wall. His descendants would play a part, furthermore, in its capture
on two occasions.99
Along with a Corinthian hero of the same name, Phokos was one of the eponyms of the
province of Phocis in Central Greece, which he was said to have visited for a period before
his death (see further on p. 565). According to Pindar and some later sources, Menoitios,
the father of Achilles’ friend Patroklos, was a son of Aigina by her second marriage to Aktor,
son of Myrmidon; the Hesiodic Catalogue is exceptional in suggesting that Menoitios was a
fourth son of Aiakos.100
Telamon becomes king of Salamis, and fathers Aias 
and Teukros
Telamon remained near his birthplace, settling on the island of Salamis not far to
the north, just off the coast of Attica. Salamis was then under the rule of another
Asopid called Kychreus, who was a son of Poseidon by Salamis, daughter of Asopos
(see p. 535), and was therefore related to Telamon; having no sons of his own, he
offered his daughter Glauke to his Aeginetan relation and adopted him as his heir.
Telamon duly succeeded his father-in-law but remarried at some stage, taking
Periboia (or Eriboia), a daughter of Alkathoos, king of Megara, as his new wife; and
it was by her that he fathered his only legitimate son, the mighty AIAS (or Ajax
in Latin).101
— The Atlantids, Asopids and Arcadians —
532

As Pindar relates, Herakles called in at Salamis to recruit Telamon for his
campaign against Troy, and prayed to his father Zeus to ask that his host should
be granted a brave and hardy son; and when Zeus sent an eagle as a sign of his
assent, Herakles told Telamon that he would father a son of such a character, and
that he should name him Aias after the eagle (aietos).102 As beﬁtted the father of
such a hero, Telamon was one of the greatest warriors of his own generation. He
sailed with the Argonauts, joined the hunt for the Calydonian boar103 and, in some
accounts at least, accompanied Herakles to the land of the Amazons (see p. 263);
but he was best remembered for having been the foremost ally of Herakles during
the ﬁrst sack of Troy (see further on p. 276). As a reward for his assistance on that
occasion, Herakles offered him Hesione, the daughter of Laomedon, the defeated
king, as a concubine; and she bore him another worthy son, TEUKROS, who accom-
panied Aias on the second and greatest of the Greek expeditions against Troy. After
performing valiant service at Troy, Aias committed suicide in the closing stages of
the war (see pp. 469ff for the circumstances), and Teukros was banished by Telamon
when he arrived home without him (see p. 577). Eurysakes, a son whom Aias had
fathered by his concubine Tekmessa at Troy, was thus destined to become the
successor of Telamon at Salamis .104 The Athenians claimed that he and his brother
Philaios ceded the island to Athens and settled in Attica.105
Peleus in Thessaly; his divine marriage and son Achilles
Peleus travelled much further from his original home than his brother, making his
way to Phthia in southern Thessaly, where he was puriﬁed by Eurytion (or Eurytos),
the ruler of the land. The Phthian ruling line had been founded by Eurytion’s grand-
father, Myrmidon, son of Zeus and Eurymedousa, who was the eponym of the local
people, the Myrmidons; Myrmidon had married Peisidike, one of the daughters of
Aiolos (see p. 410), who had borne him two sons including Aktor, the father of
Eurytion. An alternative tradition suggested that Peleus was received at Phthia by
Aktor himself. Since Eurytion had no male heir, he invited Peleus to settle in his
kingdom, offering him his daughter Antigone as a wife along with a third of the
land; Antigone bore him a single child, a daughter called Polydora.106 The Iliad
already refers to Polydora as a daughter of Peleus, mentioning that she married
Boros, son of Perieres, but bore a son Menesthios to a local river-god Spercheios;
this Menesthios later became one of Achilles’ lieutenants at Troy.107 The story of
Peleus’ marriage to Antigone and puriﬁcation by Eurytion probably goes back to
early epic since it was known to Pherecydes.108 Events followed much the same
course in the alternative version in which Peleus was received by Aktor, son of
Myrmidon; in that case, he married a daughter of Aktor who is named either as
Polymele or Eurydike.109
Along with other leading heroes of the age, Peleus and his host were invited to
Aetolia to take part in the hunt for the Calydonian boar; and as Peleus was aiming
a spear at the boar, he accidentally killed Eurytion instead, and was therefore obliged
to depart into exile once again. He sought refuge in a more northerly region 
of Thessaly, at Iolkos, where he was puriﬁed by Akastos, the son and successor of
Pelias.110 During his stay at the Iolkian court (or perhaps during an earlier visit,

since the games in question should properly have taken place before the boar-hunt),
he competed in the splendid funeral games that were held by Akastos after the
death of his father. Attic vase-painters liked to show Peleus wrestling with the 
great heroine Atalanta, contrasting his dark body with the paler body of his female
opponent. He was said to have been defeated by her. Or else he competed against
Hippalkimos, one of the many sons of Pelops, with greater success, or wrestled with
Jason.111
Matters took a turn for the worse when Astydameia (or Hippolyte), the wife of
Akastos, fell in love with Peleus and tried to lure him to a secret meeting; for she
was so angered by his refusal that she told her husband that he had tried to rape
or seduce her. As is usual in stories of this kind (see for instance p. 538), Akastos
believed her allegations but was unwilling to take action against a guest. So he
invited Peleus to join him on a hunting-trip on Mt Pelion with the intention of
exposing him to danger. Peleus met with excellent fortune in the chase itself,
defeating his companions in a hunting-contest by killing more beasts than they
could. They tried to cheat by stealing some of his prey, but he had taken the precau-
tion of cutting out the tongues of his victims and was able to expose the fraud by
producing them from his knapsack. When he fell asleep after his exertions, Akastos
abandoned him on the mountainside, removing his sword to leave him exposed
without defence to the Centaurs and savage beasts that roamed the slopes. His sword
was, incidentally, a divine weapon that had been made for him by Hephaistos;
Akastos hid it under a pile of dung. As Peleus was searching for it after he awoke,
he was seized by a band of Centaurs and would surely have been killed by them if
the noble Centaur Cheiron had not come to his rescue. Cheiron also helped him
further by recovering his sword.112 In another version of the legend, the gods so
admired Peleus’ virtue in resisting the advances of Astydameia that they sent him
the divine sword on this occasion, telling Hermes to take it to him to enable him
to ﬁght off the Centaurs (or simply wild beasts, the¯ria) who were threatening his
life.113 There was also a version in which Akastos told Peleus that he was intending
to abandon him, saying that this was an ordeal that would reveal whether or not
he was guilty of the rape.114
Peleus was sometimes said to have returned to Iolkos to exact revenge. According
to Pindar, he seized the city on his own without the aid of an army.115 Or in
Apollodorus’ account, which was probably based on that of Pherecydes, he raised
an army for the purpose at a later period, enlisting the aid of Jason and the
Dioskouroi; and after killing Astydameia, he dismembered her body and led the
army into the city through her remains.116 Some said that he killed Akastos too. A
version of this story was apparently recounted in the Hesiodic Catalogue, for a
surviving fragment reports that he brought quantities of Iolkian treasure to Phthia
(evidently after sacking the city).117 Or according to other accounts, Akastos and
his family remained in power in Iolkos, and he or his sons later harried or expelled
Peleus when the aged king was unable to defend himself after his son Achilles had
gone away to Troy (see further on p. 490).
During the next period of his life, Peleus returned to Phthia to take over the
kingdom of his dead father-in-law and married the goddess Thetis. This would
imply that his ﬁrst wife, Antigone, must have died at some stage; Apollodorus
— The Atlantids, Asopids and Arcadians —
534

explains this very neatly by saying that Astydameia had provoked her to commit
suicide as a further act of revenge against Peleus, by sending her a message claiming
that he was intending to put her aside to marry Akastos’ daughter Sterope.118
For the circumstances of Peleus’ marriage to Thetis and the brief and unhappy
course of their union, see pp. 52ff. In the usual account, she bore him a single son,
ACHILLES (properly Achilleus), before abandoning him to return to the company
of her sister-Nereids in the sea; for unlike Harmonia, the goddess who married
Kadmos at Thebes, she thought it an insufferable indignity to be yoked to a
mortal.119 In some accounts, however, Achilles was not the ﬁrst and only child of
the marriage, for she had borne previous children to Peleus but had caused their
deaths by trying to ﬁnd out whether they were immortal (see p. 55).120 After Peleus
was deserted by her, he entrusted the young Achilles to the care of his former bene-
factor, the Centaur Cheiron, who brought him up on Mt Pelion. The childhood and
education of Achilles have already been considered in connection with the Trojan
War (see pp. 456ff). Peleus lived to a great age; for some stories that were recounted
about his later life and ﬁnal fate, see p. 490.
Lesser Asopids
The rest of the Asopid family need not detain us for long. The next branch to be
added after that of Aigina was doubtless the branch associated with Salamis, the
only other island of any signiﬁcance in the Saronic Gulf. SALAMIS, daughter of
Asopos, was abducted to the island by Poseidon, where she bore him a son,
KYCHREUS, who became the island’s ﬁrst ruler. He won the throne – or merely
great glory – by killing an enormous snake that had been devastating the land.121
Or according to a conﬂicting tradition, he reared the snake, which was eventually
driven out by a certain Eurylochos and went to Eleusis on the mainland nearby,
where it became an attendant of Demeter.122 Kychreus was supposed to have
manifested himself to the Athenians at the battle of Salamis in the form of a snake
that appeared in their ships.123 As we have just seen, Kychreus welcomed the 
exiled Telamon to his island, giving him his daughter Glauke and accepting him
as his successor because he had no sons of his own. Pherecydes offered an account,
however, in which Telamon was the grandson of Kychreus, as the son of Glauke
and a certain Aktaios (probably to be distinguished from the father-in-law of
Kekrops);124 and this doubtless reﬂects the older tradition in which Telamon was
of native Salaminian origin.
Another island that came to be credited with an Asopid eponym was Corcyra
(Kerkyra, modern Corfu) in the Ionian Sea off north-western Greece. Corcyra
acquired its most important mythical associations at second hand because it came
to be identiﬁed with the Homeric island of the Phaeacians (Phaiakes), which was
visited by Odysseus (see p. 497) and was also introduced into Argonautic myth (see
p. 395). In the Odyssey, the Phaeacians are an exotic people who have close relations
with the gods, and their island of Scherie lies far beyond the everyday world in the
furthermost reaches of the sea, so far away that mortal visitors are virtually unknown.
In view of the nature of his land and people, Alkinoos, the king of the Phaeacians,
could hardly be provided with a conventional heroic genealogy in the Homeric

account. We are told in the Odyssey that he was a son of Nausithoos (Swift sailor),
who had led the Phaeacians to their distant land to save them from being plun-
dered by the Kyklopes,125 and he was married to Arete (Virtue), who was apparently
his sister in the original text of the poem.126 A passage which was probably added
after the time of Homer makes her his niece, explaining that Nausithoos was a son
of Poseidon by Periboia, the eldest daughter of Eurymedon, king of the Giants, and
Arete was the daughter of another son of Nausithoos, a certain Alexenor who was
shot down in his halls by Apollo while still newly married.127 This is, of course,
sheer fancy, on a level with Plato’s genealogies for the kings of Atlantis. Subse-
quently, however, when Alkinoos’ land came to be identiﬁed with a real place just
off the coast of Greece, he and his family were drawn into the heroic genealogies
as Asopids. According to the usual later tradition, KERKYRA, daughter of Asopos,
was abducted by Poseidon to the island that was named after her, where she bore
him a son, Phaiax, who gave his name to the Phaeacians (now identiﬁed as the
primordial inhabitants of Corcyra). Alkinoos is now described as a son of this Phaiax,
as is his wife Arete, who is his sister as in the original Homeric account.128 Although
Hellanicus is our earliest deﬁnite source for this Asopid line, it is quite possible
that it was already to be found in the Hesiodic Catalogue, for it is known that the
poem referred to the family relationships of Alkinoos (which it would hardly have
done if he had not been given a proper heroic genealogy).129 Since Corcyra was a
Corinthian colony, it is tempting to suppose that the myth of Kerkyra was devel-
oped at Corinth in imitation of the similar stories that were told about Aigina and
Salamis nearby. When composing his Argonautic epic, Apollonius seems to have
been troubled by the discrepancy between the Homeric and later genealogies of
Alkinoos, for he states that Nausithoos was Alkinoos’ predecessor as king of the
Phaeacians on Corcyra, while Kerkyra was abducted by Poseidon to Black Corcyra
instead, an insigniﬁcant island further up the Adriatic.130
Further Asopids were added as time progressed until Asopos came to be credited
with a large family of twelve or twenty daughters. Diodorus lists twelve, adding
the following to those already mentioned: Peirene, the eponym of the spring of that
name at Corinth, Kleone, the eponym of Kleonai in the Argolid, Thebe, the eponym
of Thebes (sometimes regarded as the wife of Amphion, see p. 306), Tanagra, the
eponym of Tanagra in Boeotia, Thespeia, the eponym of Thespiai to the west of
Thebes, Ornia, the eponym of Orneai in the Argolid, Chalkis, the eponym of the
Euboean city of that name, Asopis (otherwise unknown) and Sinope (see below).131
Another Asopid of note is Harpina, who was the mother of Oinomaos in the tradi-
tion of his native Elis (see p. 504).132
Of these, only Peirene and Sinope are of any real interest in their own right. PEIRENE
(who is also described as a daughter of the river-god Acheloos or of Oibalos, king of Sparta)
was loved by Poseidon and bore him two sons, Leches and Kenchrias, who were the eponyms
of Lecheia and Kenchreai, the two harbours of Corinth on the western and eastern shore of
the Isthmus respectively.133 According to a local tale recorded by Pausanias, which follows
a standard pattern and was doubtless of fairly late origin, Peirene wept so bitterly for
Kenchrias after he was killed by Artemis that she turned into the famous Corinthian spring
that bore her name.134 The remains of an impressive fountain-house can still be seen at the
site. As the eponym of the Greek colony of Sinope on the north coast of Asia Minor, SINOPE
— The Atlantids, Asopids and Arcadians —
536

was the Asopid who was carried furthest abroad. Zeus abducted her to the site of the future
city (a trading-port that is best remembered as the birthplace of Diogenes the Cynic) and
tried to win her over by promising to give her whatever she most desired; but she proved
to be too clever for him, for she told him that what she most desired was to remain a virgin.
She subsequently worked the same trick on Apollo and the local river-god Halys. Or in
another version, she was abducted to the area by Apollo, and bore him a son, Syros, who
gave his name to the Syrians who lived in the hinterland.135
The ﬁrst woman to be mentioned as a daughter of Asopos is Antiope, who is named as such
in the Odyssey;136 but as we have seen (see p. 303), she was given a wholly different genealogy
in the later tradition. She would surely have been a child of the Asopos that ﬂowed through
southern Boeotia rather than of the Peloponnesian Asopos, as would (strictly speaking) other
Boeotian eponyms like Thebe, Plataia (see p. 138) and Tanagra. The mythographers seem to
have been unconcerned about this distinction, however, since all the daughters of Asopos are
generally treated as sisters; this tendency is already apparent in the works of Pindar and
Bacchylides, who both describe Aigina (who was speciﬁcally connected with the Pelopon-
nesian Asopos) and the Boeotian eponym Thebe as daughters of the same father.137
THE ARCADIAN ROYAL FAMILY
Pelasgos, the earthborn ﬁrst king of Arcadia
In much the same way as the Athenians, the Arcadians cherished the partially
justiﬁed belief that they were an indigenous (or ‘autochthonous’) people who had
inhabited their land from the earliest times with little admixture from outside. They
liked to claim, indeed, that they were the most ancient inhabitants of Greece, a race
of ‘pre-Selenians’ who had lived in their rugged home in the heart of the Peloponnese
even before the moon (sele¯ne¯) ﬁrst rose into the sky.138 Their ancestral hero and ﬁrst
king was PELASGOS, who was born from the earth at the beginning of history, as
early as Deukalion or earlier still, and may even have been the ﬁrst man of all.
Although Pausanias is inclined to doubt that he was really the ﬁrst man in Arcadia
(for how could he have had anyone to rule over in that case?), he quotes some lines
from the early epic poet Asios which express the idea that he was the ancestor of the
human race: ‘the black earth brought forth god-like Pelasgos in the mountains with
their high-foliaged trees so that a mortal race might come to be’.139 He was the
eponym of the Pelasgians, the people who were supposed to have been the aboriginal
(i.e. prehellenic) inhabitants of Greece; in terms of Arcadian myth, he was said to have
given his name to the people of the land, who retained it until his great-grandson
Arkas renamed them as Arcadians after himself.140 Like Kekrops at Athens, he was
more a local Adam than a subject for legend, although he came to be credited with
various achievements as a culture-hero in the later tradition.
Pausanias records a rather artiﬁcial scheme in which Pelasgos is said to have introduced the
ﬁrst rudiments of civilization into Arcadia, leaving scope for his successors to improve on his
innovations and so raise the Arcadians to a fully human way of life. So Pelasgos ﬁrst invented
huts and sheepskin tunics to protect his people from the elements, leaving it for Lykaon and
Arkas to show them how to build towns and weave clothes from wool; and likewise, Pelasgos

taught the Arcadians to feed on acorns rather than leaves, grasses and roots which might turn
out to be poisonous, leaving it for Arkas to introduce bread and the cultivation of grain.141
Acorns remained a part of the diet of the Arcadians until a relatively late period, hence the
title of ‘acorn-eaters’ that was traditionally applied to them.
As has already been noted, the Argives tried to annex Pelasgos to their own royal line by
describing him as a son of Niobe, daughter of Phoroneus (see p. 230).142 The Pelasgos 
who received Demeter at Argos in early times (see p. 129) and was buried there in the sanc-
tuary of Pelasgian Demeter143 was either identiﬁed with this primordial Pelasgos or else
regarded as being of somewhat later birth as an early member of the Argive royal line (as a
son of Triopas or Agenor).144 In Aeschylus’ Suppliants, Argos is under the rule of Pelasgos, son
of Palaichthon, at the time of Danaos’ arrival. The earthborn Palaichthon (‘long in the land’,
i.e. ‘indigenous inhabitant’), whose name appears in no other source, seems to have been an
arbitrarily invented ﬁgure.145 A Pelasgos (or perhaps more than one) also appears in Thessalian
genealogies as the father of various local eponyms; since the area around Larissa in central
Thessaly was known as Pelasgiotis, it is no surprise that this Pelasgos should sometimes be
described as a son of the city-eponym Larissa, either by Poseidon or Haimon.146
Lykaon and his ﬁfty sons
Pelasgos married the mountain-nymph Kyllene (or the Okeanid Meliboia, or a
certain Deianeira), who bore him a single son, his heir and successor LYKAON.147
As might be inferred from his name, Lykaon was especially associated with Mt
Lykaion in south-western Arcadia. He was the mythical founder of the ancient cult
of Zeus Lykaios, which was celebrated in a dramatic setting on the highest peak of
the mountain; in front of the altar, which consisted of a mound of earth, there stood
two pillars with gilded eagles on top of them facing toward the rising sun. Lykaon
was also said to have founded Lykosura below, reputedly the oldest town in the
world, and the Lykaian Games, which were held in conjunction with the festival of
Lykaian Zeus and were reputed to be the oldest of their kind.148 The cult of Zeus
on the mountain, which was highly respected throughout Greece, was particularly
important in Arcadia itself because it provided a focus of unity for the people of
the land, who lived in widely scattered communities.
Lykaon fathered ﬁfty sons by many different women, and also a notable daughter,
Kallisto, who became the mother of the eponym of the land. As can be seen from
the catalogue of names preserved by Apollodorus, most of the sons of Lykaon were
eponyms of Arcadian towns.149 Since all of them (or all apart from one, who was
childless) died early at the hand of Zeus, none survived to found families of their
own, and all subsequent members of the Arcadian royal family were thus descended
from Kallisto through her son Arkas. The fall of the house of Lykaon was provoked
by a gruesome act of sacrilege, when the king or his sons attempted to feed human
ﬂesh to Zeus. Although Lykaon himself was almost certainly the original trans-
gressor, the crime is more commonly assigned to his sons, apparently because authors
of later ages found it hard to believe that the pious founder of the main cult of
Zeus in Arcadia could have been guilty of such an act. Apollodorus explains accord-
ingly that the sons of Lykaon exceeded all others in arrogance and impiety, and
demonstrated this to the full when Zeus visited them in the guise of a poor trav-
eller to test whether they were really as bad as their reputation suggested. They
— The Atlantids, Asopids and Arcadians —
538

invited him into the palace to enjoy their hospitality, but mixed the guts of a
slaughtered child into the meat from the sacriﬁces, and served this unholy mixture
to him as a meal. Appalled by their action (which was carried out at the instiga-
tion of the eldest brother Mainalos), Zeus overturned the table and struck them
dead with thunderbolts along with their father, sparing only the youngest brother,
Nyktimos, because Ge (Earth) interceded on his behalf.150
NYKTIMOS survived to inherit the throne in this version, and it is stated likewise in
Pausanias’ pseudo-historical account of the earliest developments in Arcadia that he was
Lykaon’s successor. It makes little difference, however, whether he became king or not, since
it was agreed that he had no children and was thus succeeded by Arkas. Pausanias explains
that Nyktimos took precedence over his brothers because he was the eldest (for there could
be no question of Zeus destroying the family in this rationalized narrative), while Apollodorus
states that he was the youngest of the brothers, as seems ﬁtting in the mythical context
since he could be said to have been spared because he was too young to take part in the
crime.151 If Zeus’ confrontation with the sons of Lykaon was placed in Trapezous in south-
western Arcadia (as in many accounts, including that of Apollodorus), it could be explained
that the town had come to be called by that name because Zeus had overturned the table
(trapeza) there.152 The gesture is a stock motif in stories of this kind, for it symbolizes the
breaking off of direct contact between gods and mortals. Apollodorus mentions that some
people explained the origin of the great ﬂood (see p. 403) by saying that it was occasioned
by the impieties of the sons of Lykaon.
It is suggested in another version that Zeus once visited Lykaon as a guest (for the
gods would sometimes mingle directly with mortals in the very earliest times), and
the sons of the king mixed human ﬂesh into the food to test whether or not he was
truly a god.153 They killed their youngest brother Nyktimos for the purpose in one
account.154 Mention should also be made of a partially rationalized version offered
by Nicolaus of Damascus (a historian who once served as tutor to the children of
Antony and Cleopatra). To ensure that his people would behave righteously, Lykaon
told them that Zeus visited the land regularly in disguise to test their ways; and
when the king offered up a sacriﬁce one day, claiming that he was expecting a visit
from the god, his sons killed a child and mixed his ﬂesh into the meat from the
sacriﬁces to test whether he was telling the truth (for Zeus would be sure to recog-
nize what they had done if he was really due to make a visit). A ﬁerce storm then
erupted with much lightning, apparently at the will of Zeus, and the murderers of
the child were killed without exception.155
In other accounts, Lykaon himself put Zeus to the test by serving him a meal
containing human ﬂesh while the god was visiting him as a guest. The king procured
the ﬂesh by killing his grandson Arkas (who was subsequently revived by the gods),
or his son Nyktimos, or a Molossian hostage. As it happens, this is the only version
to be credited to a pre-Hellenistic source, since it was recounted somewhere in the
Hesiodic corpus that Lykaon was so angered by Zeus’ seduction of his daughter
Kallisto (see below) that he cut up a child, apparently Arkas, and served his remains
to the god as a meal. It seems that Zeus responded by overturning the table and
transforming Lykaon into a wolf. Zeus punishes Lykaon in the same manner in the
well-known account in Ovid’s Metamorphoses, when the king serves human ﬂesh to
him to test his divinity; Ovid was bound to choose this version to accord with the

theme of the poem since it is the only one that involves a transformation.156
Pausanias was told in Arcadia that Lykaon was turned into a wolf (lykos) because he
sacriﬁced a human child on the altar of Zeus Lykaios; and the Arcadians linked this
story to a strange werewolf superstition that came to be associated with the cult of
Zeus Lykaios.157 For ever since the time of Lykaon, so it was said, one of the men
who participated in the annual sacriﬁce on Mt Lykaion would turn into a wolf after
tasting the sacriﬁcial meat, which was reputed to contain human ﬂesh. The wolf-
men who were thus created were not obliged to remain in that form forever, for
they would return to their original form after nine years if they abstained from
human ﬂesh in the mean time. If they tasted it even once, on the other hand, there
could be no possible escape for them.158 It is tempting to suppose that the local
legend about Lykaon’s child-sacriﬁce represents the original story from which all
subsequent variants took their start; but Pausanias collected the story at such a late
period (the second century AD) that we cannot be sure that it was genuinely ancient
rather than a product of antiquarian invention.
Kallisto and Arkas
KALLISTO, the daughter of Lykaon, left home to roam the mountains of Arcadia
as a virgin hunting-companion of Artemis; but she attracted the roving eye of Zeus,
who raped or seduced her, causing her to become pregnant with a male child, Arkas.
Although this proved disastrous to Kallisto herself, who was transformed into a bear
as a consequence, it at least ensured that Lykaon had an heir to succeed him after
losing his sons. Arkas ascended to the throne either immediately after the death of
his grandfather, or after the intervening reign of Nyktimos in accounts in which
that son of Lykaon escaped the fate of his brothers.
Kallisto would have had no connection with Lykaon in the earliest tradition. It seems likely
that she originated as a hypostasis of Artemis (who had a cult as Artemis Kalliste, ‘the most
beautiful’, in Arcadia), and then came to be regarded as one of the companion-nymphs of the
goddess. Hesiod is reported to have classed her as a nymph, presumably in the Catalogue (as
against the Astronomy, which apparently described her as a daughter of Lykaon).159 According
to Apollodorus, the early Corinthian epic poet Eumelos already called her a daughter of
Lykaon, while the epic poet Asios described her as a daughter of Nykteus, and Pherecydes as
a daughter of an obscure Arcadian called Keteus (probably to be regarded as a son of Lykaon
in this connection).160 By classifying her as a daughter of Lykaon, mythographers could
construct a uniﬁed family tree for the Arcadian royal family in which every line could be
traced back to Lykaon and Pelasgos (see Table 20; the details of the scheme can vary); but it
is obvious enough that the genealogies for Arkas’ branch of the family were of separate origin
from those associated with Lykaon, for the former relate to eastern Arcadia alone while the
sons of Lykaon served as eponyms for towns in every part of the land.
Although it was generally agreed that Kallisto was raped or seduced by Zeus while
she was a companion of Artemis, and that she was transformed into a bear (arktos)
thereafter and gave birth to her son Arkas while in that form, the story was recounted
in all manner of different versions. All of them can be assigned, however, to one of
two main categories.
— The Atlantids, Asopids and Arcadians —
540

(i) In the simpler versions of the story, Kallisto was transformed as a result of Hera’s
jealousy and was shot dead by Artemis while she was pregnant with Arkas. Some said
that Zeus turned her into a bear after raping her in the hope of confusing his jealous
wife, who had seen him pursuing Kallisto into a forest and tried to catch him in the
act; on ﬁnding a bear in the place of the girl whom she had expected, however, Hera
soon worked out what had happened, and provoked Artemis to shoot the bear by
pointing it out to her as prey while she was out hunting. After Kallisto was killed 
in this way, Zeus rescued her child, apparently by snatching him from her womb (as
Apollo did with Asklepios, see p. 149), and entrusted him to Maia, another Arcadian
mistress of his (see p. 161), to be reared in her cave on Mt Kyllene.161 Or in other
accounts, Hera turned Kallisto into a bear as a punishment after catching her with
Zeus, and Artemis then shot her in her bear-form, either knowingly as a favour to
Hera or unknowingly when she happened to run across the bear during a hunting-
trip. Zeus saw to the rescue of his son as usual; it is recorded in one such version that
he sent Hermes to recover the child from her body.162
(ii) In the more elaborate versions of her legend, Kallisto gave birth to her son
in the wilds after the full term of her pregnancy, and survived for long enough in
bear-form to be hunted by Arkas when he grew up. As an easily accessible example
of such a version, we may ﬁrst turn to Ovid’s narrative in the Metamorphoses. When
Zeus once happened to catch sight of Kallisto lying on her own in the grass, he
assumed the form of Artemis to approach her and then proceeded to rape her in
spite of her determined resistance. On a sultry day nine months afterwards, Artemis
invited her attendants to bathe with her after the hunt and noticed that Kallisto
was pregnant when she was obliged to undress. So the goddess expelled her from
her company, and she gave birth to her child shortly afterwards. Now Hera had
known all along that she had attracted the desire of Zeus, and the birth of the child
added a further sting to her resentment, provoking her to take action against the
girl at last by transforming her into a bear. Kallisto roamed the countryside in that
form for ﬁfteen years until her son ran across her one day while he was out hunting.
Having no reason to suspect that she was his mother, he would have transﬁxed her
with his hunting-spear if Zeus had not saved him from matricide by removing 
him and his mother to the heavens, to become the neighbouring constellations of
the Great Bear and Bootes (the Herdsman, also known in Greek as Arktophylax or
the Bear-guard).163
In accounts from the astronomical literature, Artemis herself is said to have worked
the transformation after noticing that Kallisto was pregnant, and she gave birth to
her child while in bear-form. Although there would presumably have been versions
which concluded in much the same way as Ovid’s, with her simply being hunted
by her son when he grew up, the surviving accounts are more complicated and
apparently rather garbled. We are told in one such account that the transformed
Kallisto was captured in the mountains by some goatherds, who handed her over
to Lykaon along with her child. Some time later, she happened to wander into the
precinct of Lykaian Zeus, which was forbidden ground to any mortal under pain of
death; and her son chased after her along with some other Arcadians and would
have killed her if Zeus, calling to mind their former relationship, had not snatched
them away and transferred them to the stars. Or in a slightly different account,

Zeus snatched them away when both of them came under threat from the Arcad-
ians.164 Certain features of this narrative seem distinctly odd. It would surely not
have been unlawful, for instance, for animals to stray on to the sacred precinct; and
while herdsmen regularly come to the rescue of abandoned infants in myth, the
capture of bears seems to lie outside their province. Although the question is too
complicated to be worth examining further here, there is good reason to suppose
that the story has become distorted, and the surviving accounts should therefore be
treated with some caution.
In a further version recorded in the astronomical literature, Lykaon slaughtered
Arkas while he was still young and served his ﬂesh to Zeus because he was angry
with the god for having seduced his daughter (or because he wanted to test whether
his visitor was really a god). Zeus was so appalled that he overturned the table and
transformed Lykaon into a wolf; and he then reassembled the dead child and
entrusted him to a herdsman to be reared in the country. When Arkas was some-
what older, he encountered his bear-mother while hunting in the woods and pursued
her without realizing who she was. He happened to chase her on to the precinct of
Lykaian Zeus, and Zeus removed the pair of them to the stars to save them from
the anger of the Arcadians.165
Amphion, an early Hellenistic comic poet, developed a humorous version of Kallisto’s story
in which Zeus assumed the form of Artemis to approach and seduce her. He deceived her
so thoroughly that when Artemis subsequently questioned her about her pregnancy, she
naively protested that the goddess herself was to blame. Artemis was thoroughly annoyed
by her reply, as is understandable, and transformed her into a bear. Amphion’s account of
the seduction appealed to Ovid, as we have seen; but in his narrative, Kallisto recognized
the nature of Zeus’ deception at the last moment, as one would expect, and resisted him as
best she could.166
After ascending to the throne, ARKAS gave his name to the land and also to his
people, who had been known as Pelasgians hitherto. In Pausanias’ account of the
earliest history of Arcadia, he is said to have improved on the innovations of Pelasgos
by showing his people how to weave cloth from wool and make bread from grain,
and so saving them from having to dress in sheepskins and feed on acorns as previ-
ously; he was able to instruct them in these matters because an obscure hero called
Adristos had taught him the art of spinning and Triptolemos (an Eleusinian asso-
ciate of Demeter, see p. 131) had instructed him in the cultivation of grain 
while spreading Demeter’s gift of corn.167 Whether by a local nymph called Erato
or Chrysopeleia (see p. 211) or by an ordinary human wife, Leaneira, daughter of
Amyklas, or Meganeira, daughter of Krokon, Arkas fathered two sons, Apheidas and
Elatos, and in some accounts a further son of lesser importance called Azan.168
Apheidas and his descendants at Tegea, including 
Auge and Ankaios
The kingdom was divided between the sons of Arkas after their father’s death,
Apheidas receiving the district of Tegea in the south-east, and Elatos the lands around
Mt Kyllene in the north-east. Both founded extensive lines. If Azan is included
— The Atlantids, Asopids and Arcadians —
542

among the brothers, he inherited the district of Azania in the north of the province
(but his line died out after one generation in any case, see p. 549).169 As might already
be inferred from the nature of this partition, the Arkasid genealogies and the associ-
ated family history do not cover the whole of Arcadia, but only the eastern regions 
of the province. It has been suggested accordingly that this genealogical system 
was not of native origin, but was devised in Argos, and thus presents a limited 
picture of Arcadia as viewed from its eastern neighbour. Although a scheme of inher-
itance was eventually devised in which descendants of Arkas from both main branches
of the family were presented as ruling the whole of Arcadia (or the greater part of it)
in ordered succession, the resulting pseudo-history is too artiﬁcial to be worth 
tracing here; Pausanias may be consulted on the matter. We will simply pick out
some of the more interesting heroes and heroines, most of them from Apheidas’
Tegean portion of the land. It is by no means surprising that Tegea should be more
prominent than any other Arcadian city in myth, since it was not only the most
important city in the province (until the foundation of Megalopolis in the fourth
century BC), but was also more exposed to the outside world than any other, lying as
it did in the south-eastern plain rather than in the mountains, and on the main route
between Argos and Sparta.
Apheidas, who has no myths of his own, had a single son, ALEOS, who succeeded
him as king of Tegea (or ﬁrst founded the city in the lands that he inherited). Aleos
founded the Tegean cult of Athena Alea170 and appointed his daughter AUGE to
serve as the virgin priestess of the goddess. While Herakles was returning from his
campaign against Hippokoon at Sparta (see p. 279), he passed through Tegea and
raped the princess without realizing who she was, causing her to become pregnant
with a son, TELEPHOS. After giving birth to her child, Auge tried to hide him
away in the precinct of Athena Alea; but the land was struck by a famine and plague
as a result of the sacrilege, and when oracles explained that the precinct had been
profaned, the king searched it and discovered the infant. He ordered that it should
be exposed on Mt Parthenion, and handed his daughter over to the seafarer Nauplios
to be sold in a foreign land. Nauplios treated her more generously, however, by
offering her in marriage to Teuthras, the wealthy king of Mysia in Asia Minor; and
fate also smiled on her son, for he was suckled by a doe in the wilds until some
shepherds came to his rescue. The mythographers could explain his name by a char-
acteristically tortured etymology, saying that he was called Telephos because he had
been suckled at the teat (the¯le¯) of a deer (elaphos). When he was grown up, he trav-
elled to Delphi to question the oracle about his birth, and was advised to cross over
to Mysia, where he was reunited with his mother. Having no children of his own,
Teuthras adopted Telephos as his son and heir, and he succeeded to the throne
shortly before the Trojan War.171 For the story of how he was wounded by Achilles
when the Greek army attacked his kingdom, see p. 446.
The legend of Auge is recorded in a number of different forms. In another account, Aleos
noticed that she had become pregnant, and refused to believe her when she told him that
she had been raped by Herakles. Imagining that the trouble had really arisen because she
had engaged in an illicit love affair, he handed her over to Nauplios, asking that she should
be taken out to sea to be drowned. She gave birth to her child on Mt Parthenion during

the journey to the coast and hid him away in some bushes. Nauplios took him to his home-
city, the port of Nauplia or Nauplion in the Argolid, where he passed her on to some Carian
travellers who were setting out for Asia Minor. Her story ended happily as a consequence,
for they entrusted her to Teuthras after arriving home in Asia. Her abandoned child was
suckled by a doe as usual until he was discovered by some herdsmen, who took him to their
master, a local ruler called Korythos. He was raised by Korythos and eventually rediscov-
ered his mother in the way described above.172 Or in a simpler version of the story, Auge
took him with her after giving birth to him on Mt Parthenion, and Nauplios sold the pair
of them to Teuthras, who took Auge as his wife and adopted her son.173
In yet another version, Aleos packed Auge and her son into a chest and launched it into
the sea after discovering that she had given birth to the child as a result of a secret love
affair with Herakles; but they were washed safely ashore in Asia Minor, where Auge became
the wife of Teuthras as usual.174 The earliest surviving account in a papyrus fragment from
the Hesiodic Catalogue follows an entirely different pattern, stating that Teuthras took Auge
into his palace and reared her as his daughter at the will of the gods, and that Herakles
seduced her in Asia as he was travelling to Troy to claim the horses of Laomedon. It is indi-
cated that Auge was of Arcadian birth as in the subsequent tradition.175
Aleos had two sons, Lykourgos and Kepheus, who were both said to have ruled at
Tegea at some stage.176 LYKOURGOS is mentioned in the Iliad for his feat in
having killed Areithoos the Mace-man (Korynetes, a title shared by an opponent of
Theseus, see p. 342), a formidable warrior who used to smash his way through the
enemy ranks with an iron mace. Relying on guile rather than brute force, Lykourgos
caught him on a narrow path where he had no room to swing his mace, and felled
him with a spear-thrust to the midriff.177 Lykourgos was the father of Ankaios and
grandfather of Atalanta, two Arcadians of valiant and distinctive character whose
adventures took them outside their native province.
ANKAIOS was a brawny hero who used to wear a bear-skin and wielded a double-
headed axe. He ﬁrst left Arcadia to sail with the Argonauts. According to Apollonius’
account, Kepheus and Amphidamas, the two younger brothers of Lykourgos, set off
to join the Argonauts but Lykourgos himself had to remain behind to look after
his ageing father Aleos and sent his son Ankaios instead. To explain why Ankaios
came to adopt his uncouth weapon and garb (which may be compared to the club
and lionskin of Herakles), Apollonius states that Aleos tried to keep him at home
also by hiding his arms and armour in the recesses of the palace, and he was there-
fore obliged to make use of the axe and bear-skin as the best available substitutes.178
On account of his massive strength, he was assigned to the same rowing-bench as
Herakles; and when a pair of oxen were due to be sacriﬁced to Apollo before the
start of the voyage, Ankaios felled one of them with a single blow of his axe while
Herakles felled the other with a blow of his club. Ankaios is otherwise mentioned
for the part that he played in the battle between the Argonauts and Bebrycians 
(see p. 386), in which he deployed his axe to good effect.179 He was best remem-
bered, however, for having met with a glorious death during a subsequent adventure,
the hunt for the Calydonian boar; for as the hunters were approaching the beast to
make the kill, it gored Ankaios in the thigh, inﬂicting a fatal wound on him (see
p. 416).180 There is good reason to suppose that this tale goes back to early epic;
in a scene from the hunt on the François Krater (c. 570 BC), Ankaios can be seen
— The Atlantids, Asopids and Arcadians —
544

lying beneath the boar as Meleagros and Peleus confront it with their spears. Ankaios
was reputed to have shown such bravery in continuing to stand up to the beast in
spite of his grievous wound that the Tegeans honoured him as one of their greatest
heroes. When the temple of Athena Alea was rebuilt in the fourth century BC, the
architect and sculptor Skopas portrayed the incident in a sculpture on the pediment,
which showed the wounded Ankaios being held up by his brother Epochos as his
axe dropped from his grasp.181
Ankaios left a son, AGAPENOR, who was king of Tegea at the time of the Trojan War.
The Iliad states that he led the men of Arcadia to Troy in sixty ships, which were provided
for them by Agamemnon because they had nothing to do with seafaring (as is natural for
inhabitants of a landlocked territory). According to the Hellenistic and later tradition,
Agapenor was driven off course to Cyprus while sailing home after the war, and decided to
make his home there, founding Paphos (i.e. the port of New Paphos) on the west coast.182
Before his departure to Troy, the sons of Alkmaion killed their father’s murderers at his
palace at Tegea (see p. 328).
The legend of Atalanta in Arcadia and Boeotia
Two separate provinces, Arcadia and Boeotia, claimed to have produced an
Amazonian heroine of the name of ATALANTA. The Arcadian Atalanta was
descended from Lykourgos through a further son of his, Iasos (or Iasios, or Iasion),
while the Boeotian Atalanta was a daughter of Schoineus, son of Athamas, the
eponym of the Boeotian town of Schoinos.183 It is difﬁcult to tell whether these
were originally separate ﬁgures, or whether alternative traditions came to be devel-
oped about a single Atalanta in the different regions. As far as can be judged from
the surviving evidence, the Atalanta who attended the Calydonian boar-hunt (see
p. 416) and was exposed at birth by her father (see below) was always regarded as
an Arcadian, while the legend of Atalanta’s bridal-races was primarily associated
with the Boeotian heroine of that name. So it is certainly possible that there were
two Atalantas of separate origin; but even if this was the case, the two came to be
confused or identiﬁed from quite an early period, and it will therefore be conve-
nient to treat the Arcadian and Boeotian as a single person, taking due note of any
regional distinctions.
When Atalanta was born in Arcadia, her father Iasos ordered that she should be
exposed in the wilds because he wanted male children alone. After she was abandoned
on Mt Parthenion, however, she was suckled by a she-wolf that had lost its cubs and
was eventually rescued by some passing hunters. They brought her up in the moun-
tains and she chose to remain there when she grew up, living a hardy life as a virgin
huntress with a cave for a home. When two drunken Centaurs called Rhoikos and
Hylaios once approached her cave at night with the intention of raping her, she was
alerted by the sight of their torches and shot them dead with two successive arrows.184
She demonstrated similar valour and skill when she subsequently ventured abroad,
showing that she could match herself against any male hero. Although Diodorus and
Apollodorus list her among the Argonauts,185 it is most unlikely that she would have
been included in their number in the early tradition. Apollonius explains that she

asked to join the expedition, but that Jason – who had met her in Arcadia and had
received a spear from her as a gift – was unwilling to take her because he feared that
other members of the crew might fall in love with her and quarrel.186 During 
the period between the voyage of the Argonauts and the hunt for the Calydonian 
boar, Atalanta travelled to Iolkos to compete in the funeral games for Pelias and
defeated Peleus in the wrestling (see p. 534).187 She played a prominent part in the
great boar-hunt, as has already been described, and it was agreed that she performed
her greatest heroic exploits on that occasion. She inﬂicted the ﬁrst wound on the boar
in the usual account, and Meleagros, the leader of the hunt, was so impressed by 
her bravery that he awarded her the prize of honour even though he killed the 
boar himself.188 She brought the spoils home with her, and the most durable of 
them, the huge tusks of the boar, could be seen in Tegea accordingly until they were
plundered by Augustus.189
When Atalanta’s father eventually insisted that she should settle down and marry,
she tried to escape marriage by forcing her suitors to compete with her in a race at
the risk of their lives. If she had been exposed at birth, as in her Arcadian legend,
it is of course hard to see how her parents could have had any occasion or motive
to put pressure on her to marry (even if Apollodorus cobbles an account together
by saying that she was reunited with her parents after her foreign adventures, and
that her father then urged her to marry190). It is likely that this legend of the bridal-
races was originally developed in connection with a Boeotian Atalanta who was
reared at home. The theme is ﬁrst attested in some fragments from the Hesiodic
Catalogue in which Schoineus, the Boeotian father of Atalanta, announces the condi-
tions of the contest to the assembled suitors.191 In contrast to the more usual pattern
in which the father of the bride competes against her suitors (as in the case of
Oinomaos and Hippodameia, see p. 503), Atalanta confronted her suitors in person
in order to rid herself of them. According to Apollodorus, she marked out a course
for a foot-race, knocking a stake into the ground half-way along it; and she told
her suitors to set off from that point, saying that she would chase after them 
from the starting-point fully armed. If she caught up with any suitor within the
limits of the course, he would pay with his life, for she would thrust her spear into
his back; but he would be able to claim her as his wife if he should reach the end
of the course ahead of her.192 After she had outrun and killed a number of her
suitors, a young man eventually escaped her with the beneﬁt of some aid from
Aphrodite. According to the Boeotian tradition, the successful suitor was HIPPO-
MENES, a son of Megareus, king of Onchestos (a city in southern Boeotia); or in
the Arcadian tradition, he was MEILANION (or Melanion), son of Amphidamas,
who was a cousin of Lykourgos and thus, a cousin of Atalanta.193
The successful suitor, whether Hippomenes or Meilanion, contrived his victory
by praying for the assistance of Aphrodite, who could be expected to sympathize
with him as the goddess of love. She provided him with some golden apples (or
three such apples speciﬁcally) and told him to throw them down one after another
during the race and so cause Atalanta to be left behind as she delayed to pick them
up.194 It was sometimes said that these apples came from the Hesperides like those
fetched by Herakles (see p. 269); or in Ovid’s account, the goddess brought them
from her sacred grove at Tamasus in Cyprus, which contained an apple tree with
— The Atlantids, Asopids and Arcadians —
546

golden leaves and branches.195 There are traces of an alternative tradition in which
Meilanion won the favour of Atalanta by helping her in various ways during her
hunting-trips.196
It was often said that Atalanta and her husband were transformed into lions soon
after their marriage. The story can be traced back to the fourth century BC but was
probably rather older. According to the earliest complete account in Ovid’s
Metamorphoses, Hippomenes angered Aphrodite by failing to thank her for having
provided him with the golden apples. So she incited the couple to make love in a
cave that was sacred to the Mother of the Gods (here identiﬁed with Cybele) while
they were travelling home; and the Mother punished them for the sacrilege by
turning them into lions. Or in another version which was probably of earlier origin,
the couple suffered this punishment because they desecrated a precinct of Zeus by
making love in it while they were out hunting.197 Some Latin sources add that they
were never able to make love again after their transformation because lions and
lionesses never mate with one another (for the bizarre idea had arisen that lions do
not mate among themselves but only with leopards).198 Parthenopaios (the Maiden-
born, one of the Seven against Thebes, see p. 317) was often said to have been
Atalanta’s son, whether by her husband Meilanion or by Meleagros or Ares.199
Kepheus and Echemos of Tegea
KEPHEUS, son of Aleos, the most signiﬁcant brother of Lykourgos, was also said to
have ruled at Tegea at some stage. Like his father before him, he was supposed 
to have founded one of the ancient sanctuaries of Athena in the city, in his case that
of Athena Polias (Guardian of the City). If that was the case, it is ﬁtting that the
goddess should have helped him to protect the city by giving him a lock of the
Gorgon’s hair which would render it impregnable;200 she can be seen presenting it to
him on Tegean coins. Since he had no fewer than twenty sons, Herakles sought his
help when he was setting out to confront Hippokoon, king of Sparta, who had twelve
or twenty sons of military age; Kepheus and his sons duly helped the hero to victory
(see p. 279), but at the expense of their own lives (or of the lives of all but three of
them).201 The story of the Gorgon’s hair is recorded in a second version in connec-
tion with this legend, for it is said that Kepheus was reluctant to leave his city un-
defended until Herakles provided a lock of the Gorgon’s hair as a protection; he had
received the lock from Athena in a bronze jar and now entrusted it to Kepheus’
daughter Sterope, telling her that any attacking army would be put to ﬂight if she
held it up from the city-walls three times, taking care to avert her own gaze.202
It would seem that the lock would cast terror into all who beheld it even if it would
not sufﬁce to turn them to stone as would the complete head of the Gorgon.
Another noteworthy hero in this branch of the family was ECHEMOS, son of
Aeropos, a later king of Tegea who was a grandson or great-grandson of Kepheus.
He was famous for having killed Hyllos, son of Herakles, in single combat at the
Isthmus of Corinth, and so having prevented the Heraklids from invading the
Peloponnese at their ﬁrst (or second) attempt; see further on p. 288. By virtue of
this great service that their king was supposed to have performed for the Pelopon-
nesians in legendary times, the Tegeans used to claim the privilege of holding one

of the wings whenever they served in Peloponnesian armies.203 According to Pindar,
Echemos had previously carried off a notable victory in the sporting ﬁeld by winning
the wrestling-contest at the ﬁrst Olympian Games.204 He married Timandra, a sister
of Klytaimnestra, who proved to be as faithless as the other daughters of Thestios
(see p. 526).205
The descendants of Elatos and Azan in northern Arcadia
We must now pass on to the other main branch of Arkas’ family, which was
descended from his son ELATOS (see p. 542). It was far less important than
Apheidas’ branch, at least from a panhellenic perspective, as is understandable since
Elatos inherited lands that were wilder and more isolated than those around Tegea,
in the craggy north-eastern corner of Arcadia around Mt Kyllene.206 This Elatos
should properly be distinguished from the Lapith chieftain of the same name who
was the father of Kaineus and Ischys (see p. 556), even if Ischys was sometimes
regarded as a son of his from Arcadia.207 He has no myths apart from a story that
claims that he ﬁnally wandered off to Central Greece to become the founder of
Elateia in Phocis.208 Of the various sons who were ascribed to him, two alone need
concern us, Aipytos, who makes some appearance in early literature, and Stymphalos,
who was the ancestor of all the main heroes in this line.
The tomb of AIPYTOS under Mt Kyllene is mentioned in the Iliad as an Arcadian
landmark.209 Pausanias approached the site with special interest because of its
Homeric associations, but was clearly disappointed by what he found, a mound of
no great size surrounded by a stone platform. He explains that Aipytos died from
a snake-bite while he was out hunting on Mt Sepia (Viper, apparently a shoulder
of Kyllene), and was buried there by his hunting-companions because they found
it impracticable to carry his body home.210 Pindar refers to him in connection with
the birth of IAMOS, the mythical ancestor of the Iamidai, a family of seers at
Olympia. After bearing a daughter Euadne to Poseidon, the Laconian nymph Pitane
(the eponym of a hamlet of the same name near Sparta) entrusted her to Aipytos to
be reared; and when Euadne grew up, she was seduced in her turn by Apollo and
conceived a son to him. Although she tried to conceal her pregnancy, her guardian
did not fail to observe it, and he hurried off to Delphi to seek the advice of the
oracle. Euadne gave birth to her child while Aipytos was away and exposed him in
the countryside, though with a heavy heart; but two snakes saved his life at the
will of the gods by feeding him on honey. Aipytos had discovered from the oracle
in the mean time that the child was a son of Apollo, and that he was destined to
be a great seer who would found an unfailing line of prophets. So his mother was
able to recover him, and she named him Iamos because he had been lying in a bed
of wild pansies (ia, evidently viola tricolor in this case since the poet indicates that
their ﬂowers were yellow and purple).211
According to Pindar, Aipytos reigned at Phaisane on the river Alpheios in south-
eastern Arcadia. After growing up in his household, Iamos stepped into the river
when he came of age and prayed to his grandfather Poseidon and father Apollo,
beseeching them to grant him the splendid destiny that had been foretold for him.
The voice of his father spoke out in response and guided him to Olympia, where the
— The Atlantids, Asopids and Arcadians —
548

god conferred the gift of prophecy on him. When Herakles subsequently founded the
Olympian games, Iamos delivered prophecies at the altar of Zeus, as did his descend-
ants, the Iamidai, in future times.212 The Iamidai exercised their art by reading signs
from the hides of the sacriﬁcial animals that were burnt at the altar.
STYMPHALOS, the second of these sons of Elatos, was the eponymous founder
of the city of Stymphalos below Mt Kyllene;213 the neighbouring Stymphalian Lake
was celebrated in myth as the site of one of the labours of Herakles, who cleared
away vast ﬂocks of birds that once infested its banks (see p. 260). During the reign
of Stymphalos, Pelops set out to conquer Arcadia, but pretended to make friends
with Stymphalos on ﬁnding that he was unable to defeat him, and then treacher-
ously murdered him and scattered his remains. The whole of Greece was afﬂicted
by a terrible famine as a result of this crime until the pious Aiakos interceded with
the gods through his prayers (see p. 531).214 In some accounts at least, Stymphalos
was the father of the mythical builder Agamedes (see p. 558). Two of his more
distant descendants are worthy of mention. AIPYTOS, son of Hippothoos, who ruled
in Arcadia after the Trojan War,215 met a remarkable death as the result of an act
of impiety. This occurred at Mantineia in eastern Arcadia where the great builders
Trophonios and Agamedes (see pp. 558ff) had raised a wooden temple to Poseidon,
and had spread a woollen thread across its entrance to indicate that no mortal was
allowed to set foot in it. Aipytos ignored the prohibition, however, and cut the
thread to enter the temple. As he was doing so, waves broke over his eyes to strike
him blind, and he dropped dead within a short time.216 KYPSELOS, the son and
successor of Aipytos, was ruling in Arcadia when the Heraklids and Dorians seized
control of the main kingdoms of the Peloponnese. On discovering that one of the
Heraklid leaders, Kresphontes, was still unmarried, Kypselos offered his daughter
Merope to him as a wife, rightly calculating that he could secure the independence
of his kingdom through the resulting marriage-alliance.217 Kresphontes became king
of Messenia and fathered several children by Merope, naming the youngest Aipytos
after his wife’s grandfather; and when he was subsequently murdered by a usurper,
Kypselos harboured Aipytos in Arcadia until he was old enough to avenge the
murder and recover his rightful throne (see further on p. 292)
AZAN, the eponym of the district of Azania in northern Arcadia, was sometimes
named as a third son of Arkas; his only son Kleitor, who left no heir, was the epony-
mous founder of Kleitor, the main city of Azania.218 When Azan went to Olenos
on the north coast of the Peloponnese to marry Hippolyte, the daughter of its ruler
Dexamenos, a Centaur called Eurytion tried to rape his bride (much as in the more
famous story of Hippodameia in Thessaly, see p. 555), but was killed by Herakles
who happened to be present as a guest.219 The games that were celebrated after
Azan’s death were said to have been the ﬁrst funeral-games ever to be held;220 for
a signiﬁcant incident that occurred during these games, see p. 412.

LEGENDS OF 
GREEK LANDS

E
very part of Greece had its local legends, as did the Greek islands too and the
Greek colonies overseas. Many of the most important of these have already been
considered, either in connection with the mythical history of major centres such as
Thebes and Athens or as we were tracing the tangled histories of the great families
of heroic mythology; but there remain many more, some relating to major ﬁgures
such as Orpheus and Orion who did not belong to any of the great families, and others
that never came to be of more than regional signiﬁcance, and others again that
happened to become famous beyond their regional bounds because they were taken
up by some notable poet or were especially attractive in themselves. The present
chapter will offer a selection of the more interesting of these remaining stories and
bodies of myth, particularly the older ones involving mythical ﬁgures of venerable
origin. We will approach them on a regional basis, starting at the northern fringes 
of the Greek world and then passing southwards through Thessaly and Central
Greece, before ﬁnally venturing overseas to the Aegean islands and further abroad.
Orpheus and Harpalyke, two notable Thracians
Although not strictly a part of Greece, Thrace was of some importance in Greek myth
as the home of a variety of gods and heroes who were mostly of a violent disposition;
the war-god Ares had his home there, as did Boreas, the wild North Wind, and such
heroes as Lykourgos, who persecuted the young Dionysos and his nurses (see p. 173),
and Diomedes, who fed his horses on human ﬂesh (see p. 262), and Tereus, who raped
his sister-in-law and cut out her tongue (see p. 368). Some Thracians were remem-
bered for something other than their brutality, however, such as Rhesos, a colourful
but short-lived ally of the Trojans (see p. 466), and the musician Thamyris (see 
p. 206), and the mythical singer ORPHEUS, who remains to be discussed.
It will not be necessary for us to devote any consideration to the wider and thornier
problems that arise in connection with this mysterious ﬁgure, who was the apoc-
ryphal author of theogonies (see p. 24) and other writings on religious matters, and
was thus associated with distinctive ‘Orphic’ teachings; for we are concerned with
him solely as a mythical hero who lived a generation before the Trojan War and
met an early death after trying to rescue his wife from the Underworld.
CHAPTER SIXTEEN
550

Orpheus was usually said to have been fathered by the Thracian king Oiagros on
one of the Muses, generally Kalliope.1 He was a devoted follower of Dionysos, as
beﬁtted a good Thracian, and adept in magic and all manner of wisdom (the later
the account the more varied his accomplishments); but he was above all a wonderful
singer and musician, so very wonderful that the birds and beasts, and even inani-
mate rocks and trees, would follow him in enchantment as he sang to his lyre, and
rivers would halt in their courses at the sound of his melodies. The power that he
exercised over animals is ﬁrst mentioned by Simonides, who states that birds would
hover overhead and ﬁshes leap clear out of the water in response to his music.2 His
instrument was the lyre (kithara or phorminx), Apollo’s chosen vehicle, and it was
sometimes said that Apollo himself gave him his lyre or taught him his musical
skills.3 While sailing with Jason and the Argonauts, he saved his comrades from
death by outsinging the Sirens (see p. 395).

Orpheus loved and married a dryad nymph called EURYDIKE, but their union
was brief because she soon died from a snake-bite. According to Vergil, this came
about when the rustic deity Aristaios tried to rape her and she trod on a poisonous
snake as she was ﬂeeing from him (see p. 153); or in Ovid’s version, the accident
occurred as she was roaming the meadows with her fellow nymphs shortly after her
wedding (which had been attended by sinister omens). Orpheus was grief-stricken
in any case, and resolved to make his way down into the Underworld in the hope
of recovering her. He turned his incomparable singing to good advantage during
this perilous enterprise, exploiting it to charm Kerberos into allowing him into the
world of the dead and then to soften the heart of grim Hades himself. The Roman
poets embroider on this theme at will, suggesting that the shades of the dead were
entranced by his singing, and that the great sinners who suffer torment below were
moved to pause from their futile labours, and that the eagle stopped pecking at the
liver of Tantalos, and that Ixion’s wheel stopped in its ﬂight, and that the pitiless
Furies wept for the ﬁrst time in their lives. It was perhaps because of the thrill of
his music that Hades and Persephone allowed him to lead his wife out of the land
of the dead, laying down only a single condition, that he should never look back
at her until he arrived in the world above. As they were approaching the light of
day, however, he was unable to restrain himself from looking back to check that
Eurydike was following him, and she disappeared at that instant and was lost to
him forever.4
Some version of this story was known to Euripides (and probably to Aeschylus too),5 but
we have to wait until the Roman period for any full account of it. Moschus, a bucolic poet
of the second century BC, is the ﬁrst author to mention that Orpheus’ wife was called
Eurydike; a somewhat earlier poet, Hermesianax, names her as Agriope instead, but this
name appears nowhere else.6 In view of the lack of early evidence, it is difﬁcult to tell
whether the story was very ancient; there is no sign of it in the visual arts until the Hellenistic
period (even if the death of Orpheus, which is not necessarily connected with the fate of
Eurydike, is shown on ﬁfth century vase-paintings). Orpheus was portrayed with his lyre in
Polygnotos’ great mural of the Underworld (second half of the ﬁfth century), but Eurydike
was apparently not included, and there is nothing to indicate that Orpheus was not a mere
shade like his neighbours.7
In his despondency at having lost all hope of recovering his wife, Orpheus with-
drew into an embittered solitude and shunned the company of women; or he even
came to hate the entire female sex. In the account of his death that has become
familiar through Ovid and Vergil, the women of Thrace took offence at his scorn
and attacked him when they caught sight of him one day while they were roaming
the hills as Bacchants; under the inﬂuence of their religious frenzy, they assaulted
him ever more violently and ﬁnally tore him to pieces.8 Or in a rather different
version, he provoked the women to this extreme action by redirecting his affections
from women to men, and so introducing homosexuality into the land for the ﬁrst
time. It is reported in this connection that he engaged in a love affair with Kalais,
one of the twin sons of Boreas (the North Wind, whose home lay in Thrace, see 
p. 48); since Kalais had sailed with Orpheus as an Argonaut and was a Thracian
like himself, he was an obvious candidate for this role.9
— Legends of Greek lands —
552

In some other accounts of the killing of Orpheus, the women of Thrace came to
resent him for reasons that were unconnected with his reaction to the loss of Eurydike,
either because he had refused to admit women into mystery cults that he had founded,
or because he had drawn their menfolk away from them through the enchantment of
his music.10 The earliest known account is one that is supposed to have been offered
in the lost Bassarids of Aeschylus (if it is indeed the case that the whole of the
following narrative was derived from that play). Our report states, rather mysteri-
ously, that Orpheus ceased to honour Dionysos after his visit to the Underworld
because of what he had seen there, and came to honour the sun-god Helios instead 
as the greatest of the gods, equating him with Apollo. He used to climb Pangaion, a
lofty mountain in southern Thrace, before sunrise every morning to ensure that he
would always be the ﬁrst to behold the object of his worship. Dionysos grew so angry
at his behaviour, however, that he caused his death by sending the Bassarids (i.e.
Maenads, Bacchants) against him.11 There are also exceptional accounts in which Zeus
struck him with a thunderbolt because he had been revealing divine secrets in the
mysteries that he had founded, or Aphrodite incited the women against him because
his mother Kalliope had judged that Adonis, a young favourite of the goddess, should
spend half the year away from her with Persephone (see p. 199).12
All kinds of details and additional stories attached themselves to this legend of the death
of Orpheus. Just as the whole of nature had been moved by Orpheus’ music during his life-
time, the whole of nature, animate and inanimate alike, sorrowed for him at his death; the
local nymphs wept for him, the trees shed their leaves, the rivers swelled with their own
tears, and even the ﬂinty rocks wept at his passing.13 The husbands of the Thracian women
were so angered by their murder of Orpheus that they inﬂicted pin-wounds on them as a
punishment and sign of infamy, so initiating the custom in Thrace by which all women
were tattooed.14 The head of Orpheus, which was ﬂung into the river Hebros, ﬂoated out
to sea and was eventually washed ashore on Lesbos, an island renowned for its lyric poets.15
His lyre was transferred to the heavens by the Muses, or by Zeus at the request of the Muses,
to become the constellation of the Lyre (Lyra); or else it drifted to Lesbos and was buried
on the shore with the head of Orpheus, or was dedicated in a temple of Apollo on the
island.16 In a story connected with the latter tradition, Neanthes, a son of the tyrant Pittakos,
was said to have stolen it from the temple to play on it by night, and to have paid by his
impiety by being torn apart by dogs.17
Another Thracian who is worthy of mention is the Amazonian heroine HARPA-
LYKE. Vergil, whose portrait of Camilla seems to have been partially inspired by
her legend, refers to her in the Aeneid as a Thracian who could outrun horses and
even the swift-ﬂowing Hebros (the greatest river in Thrace).18 She was the daughter
of a local ruler called Harpalykos, who suckled her at the teats of cows and mares
after the death of her mother, and later trained her in the arts of war in the hope
of making her his successor. While travelling home to Greece after the Trojan 
War, Neoptolemos, the son of Achilles, attacked the kingdom and inﬂicted a grave 
wound on Harpalykos in the course of the ﬁghting; but he was saved by his martial
daughter, who launched a counterattack and put the enemy to ﬂight. Or according 
to another tale of the kind, she raised a force to rescue her aged father after he

was seized by the Getai, a ﬁerce people of northern Thrace. In the end, however,
his plans for his daughter came to nothing, since he was killed by his subjects in
a revolt and Harpalyke withdrew to the woods in sorrow. She supported herself 
by cattle-raiding until some herdsmen attacked her in her woodland lair and 
killed her.19
The Lapiths and Centaurs of northern Thessaly
The great province of Thessaly in the north-east of the Greek mainland was excep-
tionally rich in myth. Many of the leading heroes and heroines of the southern half
of the province were of Deukalionid birth and have thus been considered in Chapters
11 and 12. The most important of the Thessalian cities under Deukalionid rule was
Iolkos at the head of the Gulf of Pagasai, the city from which Pelias sent Jason and
the Argonauts off on their quest. Peleus and Achilles, who were of different descent
as Asopids (see pp. 530ff), lived further to the south in Phthia. The only major
body of Thessalian myth that remains to be discussed is that associated with the
LAPITHS (Lapithai), a warlike people of northern Thessaly who were best remem-
bered for their conﬂict with the Centaurs.
It would be futile to attempt to construct a coherent history of the Lapith race;
although about seventy heroes and heroines are named as Lapiths in one source or
another, the individuals in question are clearly of disparate origin, and the Lapith
genealogies were never properly systematized by the Greek mythographers. We will
therefore concentrate on the families that produced the Lapiths who were most
important in myth, the two families that were descended from Ixion and Elatos.
IXION, whose own parentage was a matter of dispute, has already been mentioned
among the dead sinners who suffered everlasting torment in the afterlife (see p.
118). He started his career in appropriate fashion with a cynical murder. For when
he was seeking to marry Dia, daughter of Deioneus (or Eioneus), son of Magnes, he
promised her father that he would pay him a large bride-price in return for her
hand; but he laid a deadly trap for him when he invited him to fetch it after the
wedding. For he dug a large pit, ﬁlled it with blazing coals, and then covered it
over with a network of twigs and a sprinkling of earth to ensure that Deioneus
would fall into it and be burned to death. Since a crime of this heinous nature,
which came very close to murdering a blood-relative, had never been committed by
anyone before, Ixion could ﬁnd no one to purify him, man or god, until Zeus ﬁnally
took pity on him.20 Zeus not only puriﬁed him from his crime but also invited him
up to Olympos to share the life of the gods; and by way of gratitude, he set out to
seduce Hera, the wife of his benefactor. Hera complained to her husband, who tested
the truth of her accusation by fashioning a cloud-image of her and laying it in
Ixion’s bed. He proceeded to have intercourse with the cloud-Hera, causing it to
conceive a child, KENTAUROS, who would subsequently bring the race of Centaurs
into being by mating with wild mares on Mt Pelion. Zeus punished Ixion for his
treachery by tying him to a wheel and causing him to be whirled forever through
the sky above (or through the air of the Underworld in the later tradition). Some
authors describe this as a ﬂaming wheel, or claim that Ixion was bound to it by
— Legends of Greek lands —
554

coils of snakes; see also on p. 118.21 His hybrid descendants thrived, however, and
turned out to be as rough and impious as their progenitor. The Centaurs (Kentauroi,
a name of uncertain origin) were part man and part horse as everyone knows, being
pictured either as a complete man with the chest and hind-quarters of a horse
springing from the small of his back, or else as a horse with the torso of a man
springing from its body where its equine neck and head would otherwise be; the
former is the older representation.
Female Centaurs were a late invention; as in the case of semi-animal nature-spirits such Satyrs
and Tritons, it was imagined that Centaurs had nymphs as their wives and daughters.
Diodorus mentions an alternative genealogy for Kentauros, the father of the Centaurs, in
which he was a son of Stilbe,22 a daughter of the Thessalian river-god Peneios, who bore him
to Apollo along with Lapithes, the eponym of the Lapiths. Cheiron and Pholos were 
of nobler character than the other Centaurs and were thus said to be of higher birth, 
being respectively the son of Kronos and Philyra (see p. 73) and a son of Seilenos by a Melian
nymph.23
As the offspring of his marriage to Dia, Ixion fathered the great Lapith chieftain
PEIRITHOOS, whom we have already encountered as the ever-faithful companion
of Theseus (see p. 360). Or according to the Iliad, Zeus fathered him on the wife
of Ixion (here unnamed). The foreign adventures of Peirithoos have already been
described in connection with Theseus, including the incursion that he made into
the Underworld with his friend in the hope of winning Persephone as his bride. 
This ill-advised enterprise was usually said to have been his last, since Hades kept
him imprisoned forever in the world below. When he ﬁrst sought to marry, he
contented himself with a mortal bride, a certain HIPPODAMEIA (variously
described as a daughter of Boutes, Adrastos or Atrax;24 not to be confused with the
daughter of Oinomaos in any case). In addition to the most prominent Thessalians
and his Athenian friend, he invited the Centaurs to his wedding-feast, as was proper
since they were not only his neighbours but also his relations. They drank far too
much wine, however, in accordance with their unbridled nature, and began to molest
the female guests; or they even tried to rape the bride when she was brought into
the hall. Their outrageous behaviour provoked a furious struggle in which Peirithoos
and the Lapiths subdued them with the help of Theseus. Although this was the end
of the matter in one version of the story, it was commonly believed that the Centaurs
gathered their forces after this initial confrontation, and engaged in a full-scale war
with the Lapiths until they were defeated by them and expelled from Thessaly.
Theseus continued to ﬁght in support of the Lapiths; or in a rather different account
in which he had not attended the wedding, he travelled to Thessaly for the speciﬁc
purpose of helping in the war after it had commenced. The Centaurs sought a new
home in Arcadia, another wild mountainous region, where they remained until they
were foolish enough to provoke a ﬁght with Herakles (see p. 259).25
The legend of the conﬂict between the Lapiths and the Centaurs was a very ancient
story that was known to Homer. The aged Nestor remarks in the Iliad that the
mightiest warriors whom he had ever seen or ever expected to see were Peirithoos,
Dryas, Kaineus, Exadios and Polyphemos (all Lapiths) and their ally Theseus,

who had fought and destroyed the mighty beasts (phe¯res) of the mountains; and the
Odyssey reveals something about the origin of the hostilities, if the same episode is
envisaged, as seems probable. As the Centaur Eurytion was once being entertained
in the halls of Peirithoos, so the latter epic reports, he became drunk and mis-
behaved in some unspeciﬁed way toward his Lapith hosts, who dragged him outside
and cut off his ears and nostrils, hence the feud between Centaurs and men.26
Hippodameia apparently bore a single child alone to Peirithoos, his son and heir
POLYPOITES. The Iliad states that he was conceived (or possibly born, the Greek
is ambiguous) on the day on which Peirithoos took vengeance on the ‘shaggy beasts’
and drove them out of Pelion. Together with Leonteus, son of Koronos (see below),
Polypoites was joint leader of the Lapith contingent at Troy.27 Although both
survived the war, there was disagreement on whether they returned home afterwards
or remained in Asia, settling in the land of the Medes (see p. 489).
To pass on to the second of our Lapith families, ELATOS, a Lapith chieftain who
ruled at Larissa, fathered three children of far greater signiﬁcance than himself,
Polyphemos, Ischys and Kaineus.28 After helping to defeat the Centaurs, POLY-
PHEMOS joined the Argonauts, but was accidentally left behind in Mysia during the
outward journey while he was helping Herakles to search for his lost favourite Hylas
(see further on p. 385). He was the mythical founder of the city of Kios in that region.
According to Apollonius, he tried to rejoin the Argonauts after establishing the city,
but died on the way in the land of the Chalybes, toward the eastern end of the
northern coast of Asia Minor.29 His brother ISCHYS courted or married Koronis,

a Thessalian mistress of Apollo, while she was pregnant with a child by the god, and
so brought disaster on himself and his beloved (see further on p. 149).
The most remarkable of these children of Elatos was KAINEUS, who was origin-
ally born as a girl called KAINIS. While still quite young, Kainis was raped 
by Poseidon, who tried to make some sort of reparation by offering her the choice of
whatever she desired. To ensure that she could never be subjected to such treatment
again, she asked to be transformed into a man, and an invulnerable man besides. 
So Kainis became Kaineus, a warrior of rare strength who soon established himself as
a local chieftain.30 In the arrogance of his power, however, he became brutal and
impious. He ﬁxed his own spear into the earth in the market-place of his city 
and ordered his people to honour it as a god (a tale which may have been suggested
by some local aniconic cult); or in a slightly different version, he refused to offer
prayer or sacriﬁce to the gods but paid honour to his spear instead.31 Zeus was
appalled by his presumption and arranged for him to be killed during the war
between the Lapiths and the Centaurs. Since swords, spears and other piercing
weapons could inﬂict no harm on the invulnerable hero, the Centaurs hammered him
into the ground with tree-trunks or boulders, or both together. According to Ovid
alone, he now underwent a further and more thoroughgoing transformation, for a
yellow bird of a kind never seen before (a phoenix?) ﬂew up into the air at the place
where he had been buried under the earth.32
Kaineus left a son, KORONOS, who sailed with the Argonauts and was later
killed by Herakles while he was leading the Lapiths in a war against the Dorians
(see p. 282).33 Koronos’ son LEONTEUS has already been mentioned as the joint
commander of the Lapith forces at Troy. In some accounts, the member of the family
who joined the Argonauts was not Koronos himself but a son of his who was named
Kaineus after his grandfather.34
While we are in northern Greece, some mention should be made of the region of Epirus
(Epeiros, i.e. the Mainland) on the western coast. Great heroes such as Herakles (see p. 280)
and Alkmaion (see p. 327) occasionally ventured into it; and according to tales from post-
Homeric epics from the Trojan cycle, Neoptolemos settled there after the Trojan War (see 
p. 490) and Odysseus spent part of his later life there (see p. 500). The ancient oracle of Zeus
at Dodona, at which the will of the god was interpreted from the rustlings of a sacred oak and
other natural signs, lay in the mountainous centre of the province; it was said that a dove had
ﬂown from Thebes in Egypt long ago, and had settled on the oak and had spoken out in a
human voice to order the foundation of the oracle.35 Epirus had at least one memorable char-
acter of its own in the bogeyman ECHETOS, a mythical king of Epirus who was proverbial
for his brutality. In two passages in the Odyssey, Antinoos, the most prominent of Penelope’s
suitors, tries to force his will on the beggar Iros and the disguised Odysseus by threatening
to send them to Echetos ‘the bane of all mortals, who will cut off your nose and ears with the
pitiless bronze, and will rip off your genitals and give them raw as a meal to the dogs’. Later
sources record a single tale about him, namely that when he discovered that his daughter
Amphissa or Metope had been seduced by a certain Aichmodikos, he blinded her by thrusting
spikes of bronze into her eyes, and then threw her into a dungeon and forced her to mill grains
of bronze (as though to make ﬂour for bread, a futile task comparable to those inﬂicted on the
great sinners in Hades). In one account, he is said to have told her that she would recover 
her sight if she fulﬁlled the task.36

557

The Minyans of Orchomenos; the master-builders Trophonios 
and Agamedes
Boeotia, the province of Central Greece adjoining Attica to the north, ranked with
the Argolid as an important centre for early heroic myth. In the mythology of
Boeotia as in most of its history, Thebes was very much the dominant city, and
most of the main legends of the land have therefore been recounted in Chapter 9
in connection with the mythical history of that city. The city of Orchomenos in the
north-west, which controlled the fertile lowlands around the Copaic Lake, would
have been a place of comparable signiﬁcance in the Mycenaean period; it was prover-
bial for its wealth, which is compared to that of Egyptian Thebes in the Iliad.37 Its
star declined, however, and its mythical record is disappointingly thin. In the
Homeric epics and Greek tradition generally, it was regarded as the main home of
the Minyans, an ancient people who were also associated with Iolkos in Thessaly.
MINYAS, the eponym of the Minyans, was thought to have been an early ruler of
Orchomenos. It was naturally assumed that he must have been extremely rich, and
a Mycenaean beehive tomb in the city was identiﬁed as his treasure-house; Pausanias
brackets it with the walls of Tiryns (also of Mycenaean origin) as a Greek monu-
ment which bears comparison with the pyramids of Egypt.38 For the story of the
Minyades, three daughters of Minyas who scorned the rites of Dionysos when they
were ﬁrst introduced to Orchomenos, see p. 174. Minyas was credited with various
other children, including Orchomenos, the eponym of the city, and Elara, the mother
of the gigantic Tityos (see p. 147), and Klymene, the wife of Phylakos and maternal
grandmother of Jason.
The ﬁrst Orchomenian ruler to play a role of any signiﬁcance in mythical history
is ERGINOS, son of Klymenos, who imposed a tribute on the Thebans after his
father was killed by a man of that city; as has already been recounted, Herakles
freed the Thebans from this tribute in his ﬁrst campaign, leading them to victory
against the Minyans and killing Erginos (see p. 252).39 Some claimed that Herakles
greatly reduced the wealth and power of Orchomenos at that time, whether by
inﬂicting a crushing defeat on the Orchomenians and razing their city, or by redi-
recting the river Kephisos to ﬂood the plains to the east of the city, and so creating
or extending the great Copaic Lake which covered so much of northern Boeotia.40
An elaborate but highly artiﬁcial account of the dynastic history of Orchomenos,
up to the reign of Erginos and beyond, can be found in Pausanias.41
According to one tradition at least, TROPHONIOS and AGAMEDES, the famous
mythical builders and architects, were born at Orchomenos as sons of Erginos;42 and
it is certainly the case that they were primarily associated with Boeotia and Central
Greece (although various buildings in the Peloponnese came to be attributed to 
them, and Agamedes was of Arcadian birth in one account, see p. 549). Some of their
buildings were imaginary structures which were the mythical precursors of build-
ings of ordinary human workmanship on the same site, as was the case with their
wooden temple of Poseidon at Mantineia43 (see p. 549) or their stone temple of
Apollo at Delphi. The latter temple was said to have been the fourth of a series of
ﬁve, as the successor to a temple of bronze which had been built there by Hephaistos
(see p. 167) and the predecessor of the historical temple.44 Other buildings which 
— Legends of Greek lands —
558

were described as their work were Mycenaean structures whose original purpose had
long been forgotten, such as the ‘house of Amphitryon’ at Thebes or the ‘treasure-
house of Hyrieus’ at Hyria in eastern Boeotia.45 In one tradition, the two brothers
died together in the happiest of circumstances after building the above-mentioned
temple at Delphi; for when they prayed to Apollo for a reward, asking to be granted
whatever is best for man, the god indicated that this would come to them in three
(or seven) days, and on that day they were granted a sudden and painless death.46
Or in a less creditable tale, they came to a bad end when they tried to steal from
the treasure-house of Hyrieus. By leaving a stone loose during the construction of
the building, they had ensured that they would be able to creep into it afterwards
to plunder the treasures; but when the king noticed that his treasure was dimin-
ishing even though the locks and seals remained untouched, he laid a trap inside,
and Agamedes was snared in it. Fearing that his brother might be compelled to
name his accomplice, Trophonios cut off his head, leaving Hyrieus with an anony-
mous corpse.47 He then ﬂed, and was usually said to have been swallowed up by
the earth at Lebadeia in western Boeotia, where his celebrated oracle was located in
historical times.48
In another version of the treasure-house story, Agamedes was ensnared as he and his brother
were stealing from the treasure-house of Augeias at Elis. The snare had been set by the king
on the advice of the ingenious Daidalos. Trophonios ﬂed to Lebadeia as in the other version,
while Kerkyon, son of Agamedes, who had also participated in the crime, ﬂed to Athens
(see p. 344).49 Herodotus recounts a very similar story about two brothers who had been
stealing from the treasure-house of Rhampsinitos, king of Egypt.50
The story in which the builder-heroes were granted an easy death by Apollo may well
have been inspired by the well-known Argive legend of KLEOBIS and BITON, which told
of the death of two young men who were sons of a priestess of Hera at Argos. When they
were once planning to drive her to the festival of the goddess in an ox-cart, the oxen happened
to be late in returning from the ﬁelds; and since time was running short, the two brothers
harnessed themselves to the cart instead and dragged their mother for forty-ﬁve stades (over
ﬁve and a half miles) to the temple of Hera. Their mother was so proud of their action and
the acclaim that they won by it that she addressed a special prayer to Hera, asking that
they should be granted the greatest blessing that mortals can receive; and the goddess
rewarded them by granting them a peaceful death on that very day, as they were sleeping
after the sacriﬁces and feasting. Herodotus remarks encouragingly that this was a god-given
proof of how much better it is to be dead than alive; the captured Seilenos said much the
same to Midas when the king sought to beneﬁt from his wisdom (see p. 213).51
The oracle of Trophonios at Lebadeia was supposed to have been discovered in the
following way. When Boeotia had once suffered a drought for two years, the cities of
the land sent some ambassadors to Delphi to consult the oracle, which ordered them
to go to Lebadeia to seek a cure from Trophonios. Although they could ﬁnd no sign
of an oracle when they ﬁrst arrived there, the oldest of the envoys, a certain Saon,
caught sight of a swarm of bees and followed them until they disappeared into a cleft
in the earth. This proved to be the site of the oracle of Trophonios, and Saon was
instructed in its rites and procedures by the dead hero himself.52 Those who wanted
to consult Trophonios would descend on their own into a kiln-shaped chasm in the

earth, and lie down at the bottom, pushing their feet into a narrow opening between
the wall and the ﬂoor; they would then be drawn through the opening, as if caught
up by the current of a rushing river, and would be returned in the same way after
receiving a revelation from the hero. The experience was so terrifying that people who
visited Trophonios were said to be incapable of laughing for some time afterwards,
or even for the rest of their life according to popular lore.53
Phlegyas and the Phlegyans
Another remarkable ﬁgure who was associated with north-western Boeotia (and also
southern Thessaly in some accounts) was PHLEGYAS, the eponymous king of a
violent people, the Phlegyans (Phlegyai), who were notorious for having raided the
sanctuary of Apollo at Delphi. They were evidently a byword for bellicosity from
an early period, since the Iliad remarks that the war-god Ares and his son Phobos
(Fear) used to venture out of their Thracian homeland to join them in battle.54 Later
sources report that they lived as outlaws, preying on neighbouring peoples and
paying no regard to the gods.55 Their raid on Delphi was supposed to have been
the ultimate outrage that caused their downfall. According to Pausanias’ account of
the story, they were successful at the time, killing Philammon (see p. 435) and a
picked force of Argives who tried to defend the sacred place, but were punished for
their sacrilege afterwards by Apollo himself, who destroyed all but a few of them
by means of earthquakes, lightning-strokes and plague.56 In Latin sources, the attack
is turned into an individual enterprise by Phlegyas, who is said to have attempted
to burn Apollo’s temple to avenge the death of his daughter Koronis (an unfaithful
mistress of Apollo whose death had been ordered by the god, see p. 149). Apollo
shot him dead, however, and sent him down to Hades where he suffered due punish-
ment.57 According to the Aeneid, a rock hangs over him forever threatening to fall
down on him (a motif borrowed from the early mythology of Tantalos, see p. 117),
and he cries out through the infernal gloom, warning others to learn from his suffer-
ings by holding to justice and respecting the gods. He is regularly mentioned in
Roman literature thereafter as a sinner who was subjected to posthumous punish-
ment alongside Sisyphos, Tantalos and their like;58 although he is never mentioned
in this connection in surviving Greek sources, one may suspect that this fate was
ﬁrst assigned to him in Hellenistic literature.
Phlegyas is described as a son of Ares, either by Dotis, whose name associates her
with the Dotian Fields in Thessaly, or by Chryse, a member of the Orchomenian
royal family.59 As the former genealogy would indicate, Phlegyas was sometimes
regarded as a Thessalian, particularly in his role as the father of Koronis, the
Thessalian mother of Asklepios.60 Other reports make him the father of Ixion or a
brother of Gyrton,61 allying him to the Lapiths of Thessaly (none too appropriately,
for the Lapiths were a heroic people of very different character to the brigandly
Phlegyans). The legends of the Phlegyans tend to locate them in Central Greece,
however, in the area to the west of the Copaic Lake. The Homeric Hymn to Apollo
refers to them accordingly as an overbearing and impious people who lived in a
town set in a beautiful glade near the Kephisian (i.e. Copaic) Lake; the place in
question may be Phlegya, a town near Orchomenos of which Phlegyas could be
— Legends of Greek lands —
560

regarded as the eponym.62 In Pausanias’ late and artiﬁcial account of the Orcho-
menian succession, Phlegyas is ﬁtted into the royal line, though not without some
awkwardness;63 or in some accounts the Phlegyans are shifted further west to the
Phocian city of Daulis, evidently because of its proximity to Delphi.64 According
to Pherecydes, Zethos and Amphion fortiﬁed Thebes to protect it against the
Phlegyans, who seized it nonetheless after the death of the two brothers (see further
on p. 306).65 Apollodorus refers to a tradition in which Phlegyas was killed by
Lykos and Nykteus (in unstated circumstances, before the pair settled in Thebes 
see p. 302).66
The life and death of the great hunter Orion
ORION was primarily associated with eastern Boeotia, even if his most striking
stories are set in the Greek islands. He appears in the Homeric epics in two guises,
as a mighty hunter of long ago who continues his favourite activity during his
posthumous existence in the Underworld, and as the heavenly hunter who strides
through the sky above as the constellation Orion.67 As a ghost in Hades, he is
observed by Odysseus as he rounds up game in the ﬁelds of asphodel with a bronze
club in his hand; and as a ﬁgure in the sky, he is followed by his hunting-dog (in
the form of Sirius, the brightest star in the sky),68 and causes anxiety to the (Great)
Bear, who keeps a weather eye on him from her station by the northern pole of the
sky.69 Although of gigantic size, even bigger than the Aloadai (see p. 91), he is not
yet the uncouth being of the later tradition, for Homer describes him as the most
handsome of mortals; and we are told in the Odyssey that the ever-susceptible Eos
(Dawn) fell in love with him and carried him off, causing resentment among the
gods, who incited Artemis to shoot him.70 Though evidently a major hero in early
times, as is amply attested by these allusions in Homer and by the very fact that a
splendid constellation was named after him, it would appear that he came to seem
excessively crude and primitive as time progressed, for he was eclipsed by heroes
like Perseus and Herakles and sank into relative obscurity. As a consequence, the
picture that is presented of him in the surviving literature is both skewed and
incomplete; since the richest material is provided by astronomical sources, which
are concerned above all to explain how he came to be transferred to the sky, we
have many accounts of his death (generally of late origin) but little record of his
earlier life and Boeotian legends.
There are two conﬂicting accounts of his birth. According to Pherecydes and
Hesiod (in the Astronomy or possibly the Catalogue), he was fathered by Poseidon on
Euryale, a daughter of Minos,71 and was thus born in Crete (which was a favourite
location for stories of his death). Or in another account, which ﬁrst appears in
Hellenistic times, he was born from the earth in Boeotia in most extraordinary
circumstances. When Hyrieus, the eponymous founder of Hyria in eastern Boeotia
(see p. 520), was once entertaining Zeus, Poseidon and Hermes at his home, they
rewarded him for his gracious hospitality by allowing him to choose what he most
desired; and being childless and indeed unmarried, he asked to be granted a son.
So they emitted some semen (or else urinated) into the hide of an ox that he had
sacriﬁced to them, and ordered that it should be buried in the earth for ten (lunar)

months; and a child duly emerged from the ground at the end of that period. He
was called Ourion initially on account of his origin (the Greek verb ourein could
refer both to urination and the ejaculation of semen), but his name was later short-
ened to Orion for reasons of delicacy.72 Apollodorus presumably had this story in
mind when writing that Orion was earthborn.73 In the usual tradition, as we have
seen (p. 520), Hyrieus was said to have fathered sons of his own through a marriage
to a nymph. Orion seems to have been more closely associated with Tanagra than
with Hyria. His tomb could be seen in that town in south-eastern Boeotia, which
is mentioned accordingly as having been his home; indeed, a scholiast reports that
‘most people say that Orion was a Tanagran’.74 The Tanagran poetess Corinna
mentions him several times in the scanty remains of her verse, referring to him as
the lord of Boeotia, and Euphorion states that Hemera (Day, here to be identiﬁed
with Eos) took him from Tanagra when she carried him away.75 Although most of
the astral myths relating to his death are set in the Greek islands, the myth of his
pursuit of the daughters of Atlas (which explained how they came to be transferred
to the sky as the Pleiades, see p. 518) was set in Boeotia.76
Another Boeotian tale, which was recounted in a lost poem by Corinna, tells of two daugh-
ters of Orion, Metioche and Menippe, known as the Koronides. They were reared in Boeotia
after the death of their father and sacriﬁced their lives to save their homeland from a plague.
For when an oracle revealed that the infernal gods who had inﬂicted the plague would be
appeased if two maidens offered themselves up to them in sacriﬁce, the daughters of Orion
cried out three times to the gods below that they were offering themselves as willing victims
and cut their throats with the shuttles from their looms. Feeling pity for the two maidens,
Hades and Persephone caused their bodies to disappear and two comets to rise up into the
sky in place of them. They were honoured as the Koronides thereafter at Orchomenos, where
the young people would bring them expiatory offerings of honey each year.77
Orion married a woman called Side who also belongs to Boeotia; her name corres-
ponds to the Boeotian term for a pomegranate, and she was regarded as the eponym
of the Boeotian town of Sidai. She was consigned to the Underworld by Hera while
still quite young for having dared to claim that she rivalled the goddess in beauty.78
It may be relevant to the origin of this myth that the pomegranate had Underworld
associations, as we saw in connection with Persephone (see p. 128). After the prema-
ture death of Side, Orion crossed over to Chios to seek the hand of Merope, daughter
of Oinopion. This Oinopion (Wine-face) was a son of Dionysos and Ariadne who
had left Naxos, the island of his birth, to become the ruler of Chios, an island that
was renowned for the quality of its wine. It was said that the arts of viniculture
and wine-making were introduced to the island by Oinopion, who had learned them
from Dionysos himself; and the Chians liked to claim accordingly that they had
been the ﬁrst people in the world to make red wine.79 Although Orion tried to win
the favour of his prospective father-in-law by clearing the island of wild beasts,
Oinopion was reluctant to give his daughter to such an uncouth being and constantly
deferred the wedding. Orion grew increasingly impatient and ﬁnally broke into
Merope’s room one night while he was drunk and raped her. On learning of this
outrage, Oinopion blinded him as he was lying asleep afterwards, and cast him out
on the shore (or drove him out of the island).
— Legends of Greek lands —
562

Unable to know where he was heading or indeed where he should try to go, Orion
wandered helplessly around the Aegean; he could roam without restriction because
he was gifted with the power of being able to walk over the sea (or at least wade
through it), a power that he had doubtless acquired from his father Poseidon. He
eventually happened to ﬁnd himself on the island of Lemnos, where Hephaistos had
his forge; and the divine blacksmith took pity on him and offered him his assist-
ant, Kedalion, as a guide. So Orion hoisted Kedalion on to his shoulders and headed
east towards the sunrise in accordance with Kedalion’s directions, until he was able
to ﬁnd a cure for his blindness by turning his face towards the rays of the rising
sun. Or else he was healed by the sun-god Helios himself. Although he hurried
back to Chios to exact revenge for his blinding, Oinopion escaped him by hiding
in an underground chamber which had been prepared for him by his people (or by
Hephaistos at the order of Poseidon).80
The conﬂicting tales about Orion’s death are generally set on one or other of the
Greek islands. This is already the case in the Homeric account mentioned above, in
which Artemis shot him on Ortygia (often identiﬁed with Delos in later sources)
after Eos had abducted him to that island. Artemis took this action because the
gods disapproved of love affairs between goddesses and mortal men; or in a later
variation, she killed Orion on Delos for trying to rape Oupis, one of the Hyperborean
maidens who brought offerings to the island after the birth of Apollo and Artemis
(see p. 190).81 Or in a version which ﬁrst appears in Callimachus, Orion incurred
this fate by attempting to court or rape Artemis herself.82 A wholly different story

in which Orion was killed by a giant scorpion is most generally favoured in the
astronomical literature of the Hellenistic and Roman periods. As with the myth of
his pursuit of the Pleiades, this is a true astral myth that was directly inspired by
a feature of the night sky, for the constellation of the Scorpion rises as Orion sets
and therefore seems to pursue Orion through the heavens. In the standard version
derived from Eratosthenes, Orion once boasted that he would kill every beast on
the earth as he was hunting on Crete with Artemis and Leto, causing such anger
to Gaia (Earth) that she sent forth a huge scorpion to cause his death. At the request
of his divine hunting-companions, Zeus transferred him to the heavens, placing the
scorpion in an adjoining region of the sky.83
In Aratus’ version (which is described by him as an old story), Orion angered Artemis by
laying hands on her robe as he was clearing Chios of its wild beasts, and she responded 
by causing the neighbouring hills to break open and the scorpion to emerge for the attack.84
Or in a later variant, he angered Artemis by disparaging her hunting-skills, provoking her
to ask Gaia to send the scorpion against him;85 or in the very odd version in Ovid’s Fasti,
Gaia sent the scorpion against Leto for some unstated reason, and Orion was killed by it
when he stepped in its path to protect the goddess.86
Istros, a pupil of Callimachus, devised a deliberately perverse account in which Artemis
– who was a resolute virgin in her normal mythology – fell in love with Orion and agreed
to marry him. Her brother Apollo was thoroughly dismayed, but she paid no heed to his
objections; so one day, when he saw the head of Orion bobbing in the waves as he was
swimming far out at sea, he bet his sister that she would be unable to hit the distant speck
with one of her arrows. Since she valued nothing more highly than her reputation as an
archer, she rose to the challenge and shot an arrow straight through Orion’s head without
realizing what it was. When his body was subsequently washed ashore, she was grief-stricken
and transferred her dead suitor to the stars.87
Three lesser provinces: Locris, Doris and Phocis
The province of Locris in Central Greece fell into two separate parts, Eastern (or
Opuntian) Locris, which lay on the Euboean Straits to the north of Boeotia and
Phocis, and Western or Ozolian Locris, which lay to the south-west on the
Corinthian Gulf and was separated from the other Locris by the province of Phocis.
In the very earliest times, Opous, the main city of Eastern Locris, was the home of
Deukalion and Pyrrha, who settled there after the great ﬂood (see p. 403); and it
later fell under the rule of LOKROS, son of Physkos, a descendant of Deukalion in
the third or fourth generation. This Lokros was said to have given his name to both
Eastern and Western Locris under the following circumstances. As the king of the
Leleges, the descendants of the people who had sprung up from the stones that were
ﬂung by Deukalion and Pyrrha (see p. 403), Lokros ruled initially at Opous (which
had yet to acquire its name), and named his people the Locrians after himself. During
the period of his rule, Zeus abducted Protogeneia, a daughter of Opous, king of the
Epeians in Elis, from her home in the Peloponnese and slept with her on Mt Mainalos
in Arcadia, causing her to conceive a son. Knowing that Lokros was wifeless and
childless, Zeus arranged for her to marry him afterwards, and Lokros adopted her
son at birth, naming him Opous after his grandfather. The king was delighted with
— Legends of Greek lands —
564

the child and gave him a city and people to govern when he grew up; and the main
city of the land was named Opous in his honour.88
To account for the name and origin of Western or Ozolian Locris, it was explained
that Lokros eventually quarrelled with his adoptive son, and decided to transfer the
throne to him and found a new Locris elsewhere. When he consulted the Delphic
oracle about the enterprise, he was advised to establish his seat of rule at the place
where he was bitten by a wooden dog; and as he was continuing west through
Central Greece from Delphi, he pricked his foot on a dog-rose in the lands to the
west of Mt Parnassos, and recognized that he should settle there in accordance with
the words of the oracle.89 The most notable hero of the Locrians was Aias, son of
Oileus, who commanded the Locrian contingent at Troy (see p. 456 etc.); known
as the lesser or Locrian Aias to distinguish him from his greater namesake, Aias,
son of Telamon, he was said to have been born at Naryx, a coastal city of Western
Locris, as a descendant of Lokros in the sixth generation.90
Various tales were offered to explain why the Western Locrians were called Ozolians. Accord-
ing to one, a bitch once gave birth to a piece of wood instead of a puppy while the land
was under the rule of a certain Orestheus, son of Deukalion; and when Orestheus planted
this piece of wood into the ground, a vine grew up from it, and the people of the area were
named Ozolians after the shoots (ozoi) of this precious plant. This account of the origin of
the vine is already recounted by Hecataeus, though without the present aetiology; Hecataeus
states that Orestheus founded his kingdom in Aetolia (see p. 414).91 The name Ozolioi is in
fact suggestive of smelliness; Strabo points to the sulphur-springs of the area.92 Or if a myth
is desired in this connection, some explained that the Centaur Nessos escaped to this area
after he was fatally wounded by Herakles (see p. 281), and when he died there, his corpse
rotted away unburied, imparting an unpleasant smell to the air which has never disappeared,
hence the name of the Ozolians. Or according to another suggestion, the autochthonous ﬁrst
inhabitants of the land wore uncured hides as a protection against the cold and therefore
acquired an unpleasant smell.93
The province of Phocis to the west of Boeotia was of little signiﬁcance in myth
except as the region that harboured Delphi. It had two eponyms, both named
PHOKOS, the one a grandson of Sisyphos from Corinth and the other a son of
Aiakos from Aegina.94 The Corinthian was said to have arrived in the province ﬁrst,
and to have settled at Tithorea in the north with Antiope as his wife (see further
on p. 305).95 Schedios and Epistrophos, who are mentioned in the Iliad as the leaders
of the Phocian contingent at Troy,96 were descended from this Phokos. The son of
Aiakos arrived from Aegina a generation later and lived in Phocis for a while before
he returned home to be murdered by his half-brothers (see p. 532). He married
Asterodeia (or Asteria, or Asteropeia), a daughter of the Aiolid Deion (see p. 435),
who was ruler of part of Phocis at least at that time. She bore him twin sons,
KRISOS and PANOPEUS, who quarrelled even while they were still in their
mother’s womb (just like Proitos and Akrisios in Argos).97 They were the epony-
mous founders of Krisa and Panopea, two towns on opposite sides of Phocis to the
south of Tithorea; it was explained that their father had lived in this southern part
of the land and had given his name to it, while the other Phokos, who had settled
further north, had given his name to the northern part of the land.98 Krisos was

the father of STROPHIOS, who became a brother-in-law of Agamemnon by marry-
ing his sister Anaxibia.99 After the murder of Agamemnon, Strophios provided
refuge to his son Orestes at Krisa, bringing him up together with his own son
Pylades; and since the two boys became close friends, Pylades accompanied Orestes
when he returned to the Peloponnese to avenge his father’s murder (see pp. 510–11).
Pylades married Orestes’ sister Elektra, who bore two sons of no particular note,
Strophios and Medon (or Medeon). Panopeus, the other son of the Aiginetan Phokos,
was the father of EPEIOS,100 who fought at Troy but was more skilled as a craftsman
than a warrior, and helped his comrades to victory by building the Wooden Horse
(see p. 473).
Phocis was fringed on part of its western border by the little province of Doris,
which was thought to have been the ancestral home of the Dorians. It was also asso-
ciated with another people, the Dryopians (Dryopes), who were said to have lived
there until Herakles drove them out (see p. 281), so leaving the land free for the
Dorians, who had previously lived further north in Thessaly.101 This at least was
the story that had developed by the classical period to reconcile the conﬂicting
accounts of the early history of the area (see p. 282). The Dorians were later supposed
to have entered the Peloponnese as allies of the Heraklids (see p. 287), abandoning
their home in Central Greece.
The local legends of Megara
The legends of Megara, Attica’s neighbour to the west at the head of the Isthmus
of Corinth, are rarely of more than local signiﬁcance, even if the city became involved
in Minos’ war against Athens (see p. 340) and one of its subsequent rulers, Alkathoos,
is a ﬁgure of some interest. The ﬁrst ruler of the city was supposed to have been a
certain KAR, who was a son of Phoroneus, the ﬁrst king of Argos; he was the
eponym of the Megarian acropolis, which was known as Karia. Rather than accept
that their city had been named after Megareus, a man of foreign origin (see below),
the Megarians preferred to argue that it had acquired its name at the very begin-
ning when Kar had founded the Megaron (hall, i.e. temple) of Demeter on the
acropolis.102
According to the local tradition as reported by Pausanias, Megara was ruled by descendants
of Kar for twelve generations until the throne was seized by a newcomer from Egypt, Lelex,
son of Poseidon and Libye, who gave his name to his subjects; since the name in question,
Leleges, was a vague term that was applied to the aboriginal inhabitants of various parts of
Greece, it is no surprise that primordial rulers or heroes called Lelex should recorded for a
number of places, including Sparta (see p. 524). Lelex was succeeded by his son Kleson and
then his grandson Pylas, who offered refuge to Pandion II, king of Athens, during his exile
(see p. 374). When Pylas subsequently killed his uncle Bias, he transferred the throne to
Pandion, who had married his daughter Pylia, and departed into exile in the Peloponnese,
where he was said to have founded sandy Pylos, Nestor’s city in Messenia, and also the city
of the same name in Elis. Pandion died in Megara, where his heroic shrine could be seen
in historical times, and was succeeded by his son Nisos, who remained in Megara when
Aigeus and the other sons of Pandion returned to Athens to recover their father’s kingdom
(see p. 374).103
— Legends of Greek lands —
566

As described in Chapter 10, Minos was supposed to have attacked Megara while it
was under the rule of Nisos, son of Pandion. According to the tradition that was
accepted elsewhere in Greece, the city fell to Minos as the result of an act of treachery
by the king’s daughter Skylla (see p. 340); and it was further accepted that
MEGAREUS, a son of Poseidon from Onchestos in Boeotia, had arrived to ﬁght as
an ally of Nisos, but was killed in battle and buried in the city, which came to be
known as Megara from that time onward (instead of Nisa as previously).104 Pausanias
reports, however, that the Megarians themselves refused to countenance any of this.
As already mentioned, they claimed that Megara had already been known as such long
before the arrival of Megareus; and they were unwilling even to discuss the idea that
their city had suffered a humiliating defeat during the reign of Nisos. They disagreed
accordingly about Megareus, claiming that he had settled in Megara as a subject of
Nisos after marrying his daughter Iphinoe, and that he had later succeeded to the
throne, apparently after his father-in-law had died a natural death.105
Even though Megareus married the king’s daughter and became the ruler of the
land in the local tradition, his life ended in tragedy because his elder son, Timalkos,
was killed by Theseus when he accompanied the Dioskouroi into Attica to recover
Helen (see p. 361; Theseus was generally said to have been absent at the time), and
his younger son, Euippos, fell victim to the savage lion of Kithairon.106 This lion
was killed by Herakles in the usual tradition (see p. 251), but the Megarians linked
its death to the fate of this prince of theirs, saying that Megareus had offered his
daughter Euaichme and the succession to anyone who could kill the lion that had
caused the death of his son. On hearing that this valuable reward was on offer,
ALKATHOOS, a son of Pelops who had been banished from his homeland because
he had been involved in the murder of Chrysippos (see p. 505), killed the lion and
cut off its tongue as evidence; and when he arrived in Megara to ﬁnd that others
were also claiming to have killed the lion, he was thus able to win the throne for
himself by producing the tongue from his knapsack.107
Alkathoos was said to have established the Megarian temple of Apollo Graios and
Artemis Agrotera in gratitude for his success in the lion-hunt, and also to have
fortiﬁed the western acropolis, which was named after him. Apollo assisted him in
the latter enterprise, laying his lyre (kithara) on a particular stone while he was
doing so; and for that reason, the stone made a sound like the twang of a lyre-string
if anyone tossed a pebble at it in later times.108 Alkathoos lost his sons before his
own death as had Megareus before him, for his elder son, Ischepolis, was killed by
the Calydonian boar, and his other son, Kallipolis, perished in the most tragic of
circumstances when he arrived in Megara with the news. For Alkathoos happened
to be offering a sacriﬁce to Apollo and Kallipolis scattered the ﬁre-wood from the
altar in his haste, causing his father to believe that he had committed a sacrilege;
and in his anger, Alkathoos struck him a fatal blow on the head with a log from
the altar before he could speak.109 The heroic shrine of Alkathoos, which was later
used as a state archive, could be seen at the foot of the western acropolis.110
The myths of Corinth, Megara’s neighbour to the north, have already been
discussed in connection with its Deukalionid ruling family (see p. 430). Within the
Peloponnese to the west of Corinth lay the city of Sicyon, which had been founded
from Argos. Two of its mythical rulers make signiﬁcant appearances in heroic myth,

ﬁrstly Epopeus, who provoked an attack from Thebes by harbouring and marrying
the fugitive Antiope (see p. 303), and secondly Polybos, who reared Oedipus as his
adoptive son a generation or so later (see p. 308), and offered a home to Adrastos when
he was exiled from Argos (see p. 332). Pausanias provides a complicated and artiﬁcial
account of the Sicyonian succession from the time of the city’s foundation.111
Three romantic legends from Patrai
There is little left to report of the old heroic legends of the Peloponnese, which
have been examined in connection with the Inachids, Deukalionids and Atlantids.
While we are in this area, however, it would be a shame to pass over some romantic
legends that were collected by Pausanias at Patrai on the northern coast.
Not far from Patrai, near the mouth of the river Selemnos, there was once a town
called Argyra (although it was no more than a ruin by Pausanias’ time). According
to local legend, a handsome shepherd boy called SELEMNOS had once lived in that
area, and had attracted the love of a sea-nymph called ARGYRA, who used to
emerge from the sea to consort with him; but she ceased to visit him when his
beauty began to fade, and he died of a broken heart. Aphrodite, as the goddess who
presided over love, took pity on him and transformed him into the river Selemnos;
and when he continued to yearn for Argyra even in his new form, she granted him
the additional favour of causing him to forget his love. Ever afterwards, so it was
claimed, the river would confer the same favour on anyone who bathed in it, causing
men and women alike to forget their passions. Pausanias, who rarely makes any
personal observations, feels impelled to remark that if this is really the case, the
waters of the Selemnos are of greater worth than a large amount of money.112
At Patrai itself, there was a sanctuary of Artemis Triklaria at which human sacri-
ﬁces were said to have been offered in early times. According to the temple legend,
a maiden called KOMAITHO had once served as a priestess in the temple long
before the Trojan War, and had fallen in love with a young man called MELA-
NIPPOS; but their parents had refused to allow them to marry, and they had
consummated their passion in secret, making love inside the temple on more than
one occasion. In her anger at the sacrilege, Artemis afﬂicted the land with famine
and disease; and when the local people sought the advice of the Delphic oracle, they
were told not only that the guilty couple should be offered in sacriﬁce to Artemis,
but also that the most attractive youth and maiden in the area should be offered
up to her likewise in each successive year. The oracle indicated that the Patraians
would be relieved of this painful duty when a foreign king arrived in their land
with a foreign deity, an event that ﬁnally occurred in the following circumstances
just after the Trojan War. During the division of the spoils after the sack of Troy,
EURYPYLOS, son of Euaimon, a Thessalian ruler, was given a most precious object,
a chest containing a statue of Dionysos which had been fashioned by Hephaistos;
this statue had been passed down in the Trojan royal family ever since it had been
presented to the ﬁrst king, Dardanos, by his father Zeus. Since Kassandra had put
a curse on any Greek who found the statue, Eurypylos was driven mad when he
opened the chest to look at it. He was sufﬁciently lucid at times, however, to be
able to consult the Delphic oracle, which told him to settle in a land where he
— Legends of Greek lands —
568

found a people offering a strange sacriﬁce and to install the chest there for worship.
When his ship was then blown to the northern coast of the Peloponnese in the
region of Patrai, he stepped ashore there and saw a maiden and youth being led to
the altar of Artemis for that year’s sacriﬁce. He realized at once that this must be
the sacriﬁce that the oracle had meant; and on seeing this foreign king in their land,
the Patraians recalled the oracle that they had received long before and checked
whether he had a god inside the chest, as was indeed the case. So Eurypylos was
delivered from his madness and the people of Patrai from their human sacriﬁces. In
historical times, they offered sacriﬁce to Eurypylos every year in connection with
their festival of Dionysos.113
Patrai was a place of no great importance until Augustus planted a colony there
after defeating Marcus Antonius. Among some plunder from Aetolia that was
deposited at the city by the emperor, there was an ancient statue of Dionysos from
Calydon which thus came to be housed in the Patraian temple of Calydonian
Dionysos; the following tale, which is set in its place of origin on the mainland oppo-
site, was recounted in connection with it. A Calydonian priest of Dionysos called
KORESOS had fallen in love with a maiden called KALLIRHOE, but the more 
he pressed himself on her the less she liked him. Finding that all his pleas and
promises made no impression on her, he prayed to the cultic image (apparently for
vengeance rather than assistance), and Dionysos responded by afﬂicting the
Calydonians with a madness that caused many of them to die insane. When they
sought the advice of the oracle of Zeus at Dodona, they were told that Dionysos 
was to blame, and that his anger would not be allayed until Koresos had sacriﬁced 
a human victim to him, either Kallirhoe or someone who volunteered to take her
place. As Kallirhoe was being brought to the altar, Koresos found that his love for
her outweighed his meaner feelings of resentment, and sacriﬁced himself to the god
in place of her as a willing substitute. On seeing him lying dead at her feet, Kallirhoe
felt pity for him and remorse at the way that she had treated him, and killed herself
in her turn, cutting her throat by a local spring that was known by her name 
ever afterwards.114
Anios of Delos and his wonder-working daughters; Akontios 
and Kydippe; Kyparissos
We must now travel further abroad to consider some of the more interesting myths
of the Greek islands. At the time of the Trojan War, the holy island of Delos was
home to a picturesque family consisting of the priest-king ANIOS and his three
daughters, Oino, Spermo and Elais, who could draw wine (oinos), grain (cf. sperma, 
a seed) and olive-oil (elaion) from the ground at will. These remarkable maidens were
known collectively as the OINOTROPHOI (Wine-growers).115 Anios was a son 
of Apollo, who had seduced his mother RHOIO (Pomegranate-woman), daughter of
Staphylos (Grape-cluster-man, a son of Dionysos) in the land of her birth on the
Carian coast of Asia Minor. Her father refused to believe her when she told him that
a god had made her pregnant, and locked her up in a chest and set her adrift in the
sea (a familiar motif in Greek myth, as we have seen with Danae and Auge). She was
washed ashore on Delos, where she gave birth to her child and placed him on Apollo’s

altar, praying to the god to save him if he recognized him as his son. Anios was duly
reared and befriended by his divine father, who instructed him in the arts of divina-
tion.116 It was said that his mother named him Anios because of all the distress (ania)
that she had suffered on his account.117 In another version of her story, she was
washed ashore on Euboea (where she subsequently married a certain Zarex), and her
son was transferred to Delos after his birth by Apollo.118
Anios grew up to become a celebrated seer and priest of Apollo, and ruled over
the holy island. He married a certain Dorippe and fathered the above-mentioned
daughters, who acquired their special powers through the grace of Dionysos.119
A variety of tales are recorded in which the Greek army is said to have sought (or
been offered) the services of the Oinotrophoi just before the Trojan War or after its
outbreak. In one account, the Greek force called in at Delos on its way to Troy;
and since Anios was aware that the gods had revealed that Troy would remain uncon-
quered for ten years, he vainly attempted to persuade the Greeks to remain with
him for the following nine years, promising that his daughters would be able the
furnish them with the necessary provisions. This story may already have appeared
in the Cypria.120 Or when the Greeks ran short of food during the long siege of
Troy, Agamemnon sent Palamedes to Delos to fetch the Oinotrophoi; or in a version
attributed to Simonides, Menelaos and Odysseus sailed to Delos at some stage with
many followers for that purpose.121 Ovid offers an account in which Agamemnon
seized the Oinotrophoi, here four in number, by force of arms, and ordered them
to feed the Greek ﬂeet; but they all escaped, two of them ﬂeeing to Euboea and the
others to Andros, which was ruled by a son of Anios. When the Greeks sailed to
Andros and forced the king to surrender the latter pair, they prayed for help to
Dionysos, who transformed them into snow-white doves.122 Only in some late Latin
accounts are the Oinotrophoi said to have came to Aulis (where the army ﬁrst assem-
bled) to provide the Greeks with provisions for their voyage and campaign.123 Ovid
and Vergil both say that Aeneas and his followers called in at Delos on their way
to Italy, and received a friendly welcome from Anios (see p. 588).124
The legend of Anios and his wonder-working daughters is so quaint as to suggest
that it may have been of popular origin; from Keos, to the south-east of the tip of
Attica, comes a pretty romance which is more of a literary product, at least in the
form in which it has come down to us. AKONTIOS, a young Kean from a
respectable but relatively poor family, fell in love with a higher-born Naxian (or
Athenian) named KYDIPPE when he happened to meet her at a festival on Delos.
After following her to the temple of Artemis, he threw an apple in front of her
inscribed with the words, ‘I swear by Artemis to marry none but Akontios’. Kydippe
picked it up (apples were a very common love-gift but it seems that she did not
realize this) and innocently read the message, speaking the words aloud as readers
commonly did in ancient times. By so doing, she bound herself to Akontios by a
solemn oath. When her father subsequently tried to marry her to the man of his
choice, she suffered a mysterious illness and he was obliged to postpone the marriage;
and after being forced to do so on two further occasions, he sought the advice of
the Delphic oracle, which revealed that Artemis was making his daughter ill to
prevent her from breaking her oath. So he agreed that she should marry Akontios,
whose scheme was thus brought to fulﬁlment.125
— Legends of Greek lands —
570

Keos is also the location of the story of KYPARISSOS, at least in the best-known
account of it by Ovid. Kyparissos was a young favourite of Apollo who was turned
into a cypress-tree in the following circumstances. A tame stag lived on the island
in his time, a splendid beast which was sacred to the nymphs and wholly without
fear; and although it was friendly to everyone, Kyparissos was especially fond of it
and used to lead it to new pastures and refreshing springs, and would wreathe its
horns with garlands and even ride on its back, guiding it with scarlet reins. One
day, however, while it was resting under the shade of some trees in the midday
heat, Kyparissos happened to throw his hunting-spear in that direction and acci-
dentally killed it. In the intensity of his grief, he resolved to join it in death, even
though Apollo urged him to show a proper sense of proportion. As he was wasting
away in his sorrow, he prayed to the gods to be allowed to mourn forever, and was
transformed into a cypress, a tree associated with mourning and graveyards.126 In
another account, Kyparissos was a young Cretan who ﬂed from his homeland to
escape the advances of Apollo (or Zephyros), and was transformed into a cypress-
tree on Mt Kasion in Syria. This version of his story, which was presumably of
Hellenistic origin, seems to have been modelled on the famous legend of Apollo
and Daphne (see p. 155), which is also set in Syria in one version.127
The legendary history of Thera; Merops of Kos; 
Ankaios of Samos
Stony Seriphos further to the south was famous in myth for its association with
Perseus (see pp. 239ff); and on the southern bounds of the archipelago lay Anaphe,
which was revealed to the night-bound Argonauts by Apollo (see p. 397), and Thera,
which grew from a clod of earth which was thrown into the sea by the Argonaut
Euphemos (see p. 397). The myths of this latter island will merit further attention.
Thera (also known as Santorini in modern times) is formed from the remains of an
ancient volcano which exploded in a massive eruption in about 1400 BC. Cyrene, the
most important Greek colony in Africa, was founded from it in the middle of the
seventh century BC. According to legend, Kadmos visited it during his fruitless
search for Europa (see p. 295), and installed some of his Phoenician followers on the
island as settlers under the leadership of a kinsman of his, a certain Membliaros.128
It was said that the island was known as Kalliste (the Most Beautiful) in these early
times. It continued to be ruled by descendants of Membliaros until THERAS, son of
Autesion, who was a descendant of Kadmos, arrived there eight generations later and
claimed the throne by virtue of his descent. His father Autesion had been heir to 
the throne at Thebes, but had left the city to accompany the Heraklids to the
Peloponnese, and Theras spent much of his earlier life in Sparta as a consequence (see
p. 329). His sister Argeia married Aristodemos, one of the Heraklid leaders, and bore
him twin sons, Prokles and Eurysthenes, who became the ﬁrst Heraklid kings of
Sparta (see p. 290 for the circumstances); and since they were infants when the
kingdom was allocated to them, Theras ruled on their behalf as regent until they
came of age. After enjoying this taste of power, he was reluctant to live in Sparta as
a subordinate when the twins took over the throne, and therefore decided to sail away

to claim Kalliste as a kingdom of his own. The inhabitants readily accepted him as
their ruler, and he renamed the island after himself.129
Theras was accompanied to his new home by some Dorian followers from Sparta
(for Thera had a Dorian population in classical times) and also some descendants of
the Argonauts. It will be remembered that the island was supposed to have grown
from a clod of earth that the Argonaut Euphemos had received from the god of
Lake Tritonis in Libya (see p. 396). Euphemos had thrown the clod into the sea at
the proper site in response to a prophetic dream, which had revealed that the new
island would provide a home for his descendants;130 and this was duly brought to
pass in the time of Theras as a result of the following circumstances. When the
Argonauts had called in at Lemnos during their outward journey, many of them
had fathered children by the women of the island, who had previously slaughtered
their menfolk (see p. 384); and the descendants of these children were later expelled
from Lemnos and settled in Laconia, where they married local women. They behaved
with such arrogance, however, that their hosts turned against them, and some of
them, including descendants of Euphemos, were therefore happy to sail away with
Theras when he invited them to accompany him. This was a signiﬁcant feature of
the legend because it enabled a link to be established between the origins of Thera
and the founding of Cyrene from the island in historical times; for it was claimed
that Battos, who led a party of Theraeans and Cretans to found this important colony
in North Africa, was a remote descendant (supposedly in the seventeenth genera-
tion) of the Euphemos who had received the marvellous clod of earth from Triton
in North Africa.131 A circle was thus completed, and the establishment of the colony
in Africa was legitimized in mythical terms. Cyrene was ruled by descendants of
Battos until the middle of the ﬁfth century BC; it was supposed to have been named
after a Thessalian nymph who had been abducted to its site in early times by Apollo
(see p. 152). It may be noted that this account of the mythical history of Thera is
marred by a serious chronological inconsistency, since Kadmos could not possibly
have visited it if it was ﬁrst formed in the time of the Argonauts, who must have
lived several generations later by any reckoning.
The most important heroic myths of Rhodes, the island of the Sun (see p. 43),
have been covered already in connection with the Cretan royal family (see p. 354)
and the Heraklids (see p. 293). The island of Cos, further up the coast of Asia
Minor, was visited by Herakles while he was sailing home after his attack on Troy
(see p. 276). It was ruled in the very earliest times by an earthborn king called
MEROPS, who was ﬁnally transformed into an eagle. In the version from the astro-
nomical literature, this came about after his much-loved wife, the nymph Echemeia
(or Ethemeia), offended Artemis by ceasing to honour her and was shot dead by her.
Merops missed her so greatly that he wanted to kill himself, but Hera (presumably
as the goddess who presided over married love) took pity on him and transferred
him to the heavens. Before doing so, she turned him into an eagle, thinking that
he would continue to grieve for his wife if he retained his human form and memory,
and he is therefore represented in the sky as the constellation of the Eagle (Aquila).132
In another version, the goddess Rhea, who had formerly been received by Merops
as a guest, took pity on him in the same circumstances and transformed him into
an eagle, here an earthly eagle which became the special bird of Zeus.133 Since
— Legends of Greek lands —
572

Merops lived at the beginning of history, there is nothing surprising in the notion
that he should have mixed with the gods on familiar terms (as did Lykaon, for
instance, or Tantalos in Asia Minor nearby). It is reasonable to assume that this was
the earlier version of the story, before it was altered to provide a constellation myth.
Merops was the eponym of the Meropes, the primordial inhabitants of the island;
it is said that the island was named Meropia until Merops renamed it after his
daughter Kos.134 There was an early epic entitled the Meropis, but nothing is known
of its contents.
The island of Samos further up the coast had a memorable hero in ANKAIOS,
who not only sailed with the Argonauts like his Arcadian namesake (see p. 383),
but was also killed by a boar just like him. A son of Zeus or Poseidon by Astypalaia
(the eponym of an island of the same name to the west of Cos), Ankaios ruled over
the Leleges, the aboriginal inhabitants of Samos. He was skilled in the arts of seaman-
ship, as beﬁts an islander, and volunteered to become the steersman of the Argo after
the original helmsman, Tiphys, died on the outward journey (see p. 389). When he
arrived home from his adventures, he turned his attention to agriculture and planted
many vines, but was warned by a seer that he would meet his death before he could
drink from their fruit. Since all seemed well with him when the crop was ripe, he
pressed some grapes and summoned the seer to rebuke him for his incompetence.
‘I’m still alive’, he said, ‘and the fruit is ripe, and I’m just about to drink; look,
you can see the wine in the cup’. In no way disconcerted, the seer replied, ‘There’s
many a slip between the cup and the lip’; and at that very moment, a man ran up
to warn Ankaios that a wild boar was ravaging his vineyard. So he put the cup aside
to confront the beast, and was killed by it before he could raise the cup to his
lips.135 Hence the famous proverb, which was transmitted into English through the
Latin version in Erasmus’ anthology of ancient adages.
Kinyras, Pygmalion and the legends of Cyprus
Cyprus attracted settlers from Greece and the Levant alike from the late Bronze Age
onwards, and was thus signiﬁcant as a point of contact between Greek and Near
Eastern culture. It was a principal centre for the cult of Aphrodite, hence the
goddess’s title of the Cyprian (Kypris or Kypria). The most notable Cypriot in Greek
heroic legend was KINYRAS, the mythical founder of the cult of Aphrodite–Astarte
at Paphos on the west coast of the island (where the goddess was supposed to have
come ashore after she was born among the waves). He originated as the eponym and
mythical ancestor of the clan of priests who presided over this cult, the Kinyridai,
whose name was derived from a Semitic expression meaning ‘sons of the lyre’. He is
ﬁrst mentioned in the Iliad, which reports that he sent a magniﬁcent breastplate to
Agamemnon as a gift of friendship after learning that the Greeks were mounting an
expedition against Troy; this was an exotic piece of metal-work of Near Eastern
design, ornamented with ten bands of dark blue enamel (kyanos) and twelve of gold
and twenty of tin, and with enamelled snakes reaching up to the neck, three on each
side.136 Later authors elaborate on this Homeric story by suggesting that the Greeks
tried to enlist Kinyras as an ally. According to Apollodorus, Menelaos visited him on
Cyprus for that purpose in the company of Odysseus and the herald Talthybios, and

met with apparent success, for Kinyras not only presented the breastplate as a gift for
Agamemnon but promised to send a large force of troops in ﬁfty ships; but when the
time came for him to fulﬁl his oath, he did so in a purely formal manner alone by
sending a single proper ship out to sea with forty-nine ships of clay, crewed with men
of clay, which soon foundered in the waves.137 Or in another account, Palamedes was
sent to enlist the aid of Kinyras, but secretly advised him to have nothing to do with
the war; so although Palamedes announced on his return that Kinyras would send a
hundred ships, none ever appeared.138
There was no settled tradition on the birth and origin of Kinyras. He was born
on Cyprus in some accounts, usually as a son of Paphos, the eponym of the Cypriot
city of that name; or else he was born in Cilicia, the province of Asia Minor facing
Cyprus to the north, as a son of Sandakos (a descendant of Kephalos and Eos), and
emigrated to Cyprus with a group of followers to found the city of Paphos.139 He
married a certain Kenchreis, who bore him a notable daughter, Myrrha (or Smyrna);
for the story of how Myrrha deceived her father into sleeping with her and conceived
Adonis to him, see p. 198.140 Or else he married Metharme, daughter of Pygmalion,
and fathered Adonis by her as a legitimate child along with various other chil-
dren.141 Kinyras killed himself in one account after discovering that he had slept
with his own daughter; or else he reigned in prosperity to an extraordinary age; or
he was put to death by Apollo after being defeated by him in a musical contest.142
In connection with the latter story, it was said that his daughters threw themselves into the
sea in sorrow at his death and were turned into halcyons (a mythical bird, see p. 410).143
According to another tale, which presumably refers to the temple-prostitution that was prac-
tised in connection with the cult of Aphrodite-Astarte, Aphrodite forced them to sleep with
strangers as a punishment after they had offended her in some unspeciﬁed manner.144 Ovid
records a comparable tale in which some Cypriot women called the Propoitides denied the
divinity of Aphrodite, so angering her that she caused them to become the ﬁrst women to
lose their good name by prostituting themselves in public.145
Another Cypriot tale mentioned by Ovid is that of the Kerastai (Cerastae in Latin form)
or Horned Men, a race of men with horns on their foreheads who caused distress to the
tender-hearted Aphrodite by offering human sacriﬁces to Zeus. She even thought of aban-
doning her Cypriot shrines, but the sight of their horns inspired her with a better idea and
she settled the matter in another way by transforming them into bulls.146 Ovid also makes
a passing allusion to the daughters of Kinyras, remarking that they were transformed into
the steps of a temple (though without explaining why).147
Few stories from Greek myth are more familiar than that of PYGMALION, the
king of Cyprus who fell in love with a statue of his own creation. Having long
remained a bachelor because of the dubious morals of the women around him,
Pygmalion carved an ivory image of a woman of perfect beauty and conceived an
ever-deepening passion for it. He kissed and embraced it, presented gifts to it as
though it were alive, and adorned it with robes and ﬁne jewellery, and laid it out
on a couch strewn with purple cloth; and when the day arrived for the feast of
Aphrodite, he offered rich sacriﬁces to the goddess and prayed to be granted a wife
like the ivory maiden, not quite daring to say that the statue itself was the object
of his desire. But the goddess divined his hidden thoughts and brought the statue
— Legends of Greek lands —
574

to life. Such is the story recounted by Ovid, who adds that Pygmalion fathered
Paphos, the mother of Kinyras, by his newly created wife; although the woman has
come to be known as Galatea, no ancient author ascribes any name to her. There is
also some record of an earlier Greek version in which Pygmalion fell in love with
an ivory image of Aphrodite, here not of his own creation, and treated it much as
if it were alive, taking it to bed and embracing it. To this extent at least, the story
resembles that in which Laodameia consorted with a statue of her dead husband (see
p. 450); there is no suggestion in the surviving sources that Aphrodite brought the
statue to life in this account.148
It was perhaps inevitable that Salamis, the principal Greek city on Cyprus, should
have been assigned a mythical founder from the island of that name off the coast

of Attica. It was explained that Teukros, the illegitimate son of Telamon, king of
Salamis (see p. 276), was banished by his father when he returned from the Trojan
War without his half-brother Aias (who had committed suicide, see p. 471). His
position as a king on Cyprus is ﬁrst mentioned by Pindar, and the reason for his
exile is ﬁrst indicated in Euripides’ Helen, in which Teukros himself makes an appear-
ance and tells how he was banished by his father, and then settled on Cyprus on
the advice of an oracle from Apollo.149 Later sources add nothing essential to this
story, although some mythographers explained that Telamon had particular cause
for anger because Teukros failed to bring the ashes of Aias and arrived without his
son and concubine (who had sailed on another ship).150 According to Vergil, Teukros
established himself on Cyprus with the aid of Belos, the father of Dido.151 He
married one of the daughters of Kinyras, or else a granddaughter of his, Eune,
daughter of Kypros; the Teukridai, the traditional rulers of Cypriot Salamis, claimed
to be his descendants.152 Other notable Greeks who were said to have travelled to
Cyprus after the Trojan War were Agapenor, king of Arcadia (see p. 545), and
Akamas, son of Theseus (see p. 375).
Three love-stories from Asia Minor and beyond
HERO and LEANDROS (or Leander in Latin) were two ill-starred lovers who lived
on either side of the narrow straits of the Hellespont (Dardanelles). Leandros, who
lived at Abydos on the Asian shore, fell in love with Hero, a young priestess of
Aphrodite, after meeting her at a festival of the goddess in her home-town of Sestos
on the opposite shore. He used to swim across the straits at night to visit her in
secret, guided on his way by a lamp that she shone from her tower by the shore;
but one night, when he rashly attempted to make the crossing even though a ﬁerce
storm was blowing, Hero’s guiding ﬂame was extinguished by the wind, and he
soon lost his bearings and was swept to his death by the dangerous current. When
Hero looked down from her tower on the following morning and saw his corpse at
the water’s edge, she hurled herself down so as to be united with him in death.
This legend, which was apparently of Hellenistic origin, ﬁrst appears in Vergil and
Ovid and is recounted in full in an epyllion (miniature epic) by Musaeus, probably
dating to the ﬁfth century AD. It has remained popular ever since; the Elizabethan
rendering by Marlowe and Chapman is ﬁner than any version that has survived from
the ancient world.153
The legend of PHILEMON and BAUCIS, which is also set in Asia Minor and
was apparently based on Phrygian traditions, is a love-story too in its very different
way. As Zeus and Hermes were once travelling through Phrygia in human disguise
and looking for somewhere to rest, they were turned away from countless homes
until Philemon and Baucis, a poor and aged peasant couple, welcomed them into
their lowly cottage. As the pair were providing their guests with such food and
drink as their means allowed, they noticed that the mixing-bowl that they were
using for the wine ﬁlled itself of its own accord as often as it was drained, and
inferred from this that their visitors must be gods. Although they were then eager
to kill their only goose in honour of their divine guests, the two gods prevented

them and told them that they were planning to punish the people all around, but
that the old pair would escape if they climbed to the top of the mountain that rose
up behind their cottage. On reaching the top, the couple looked back and saw that
the gods had ﬂooded the countryside below to punish the local people for their
hard-heartedness, leaving only their own cottage unaffected. As they watched in
amazement, their cottage was then transformed into a splendid temple with a ﬂoor
and columns of marble and a roof of gold. When the gods promised to grant them
whatever they most desired, they asked to serve as their priest and priestess in the
newly created temple, and to die at the same instant so that neither would be left
alone. After a long and happy old age, they died together as they had asked, and
were transformed into two trees, an oak and a lime, which grew from a single
trunk.154 Goethe was greatly struck by this story and adapted it to his own purposes
in the ﬁnal book of his Faust.
The ill-starred lovers PYRAMOS and THISBE appear in two legends of a very
different nature. The less familiar story connects them with a river and a spring,
the river Pyramos, which ﬂowed to the sea in Cilicia in the south-eastern corner of
Asia Minor, and the spring of Thisbe, which issued into the sea nearby (or perhaps
into the mouth of the river itself). Long ago, so it was said, there had been two
lovers called Pyramos and Thisbe whose passion had ended in tragedy, for Thisbe
had committed suicide after becoming pregnant and Pyramos had followed her
example after learning of her fate; but the gods had taken pity on them and had
transformed them into the above-mentioned river and spring, to enable them to
associate intimately in their new form by mingling their waters (just as Alpheios
was supposed to mingle his waters with those of Arethousa, see p. 42).155
Ovid’s Babylonian love-tragedy of Pyramos and Thisbe, which is acted out by
Peter Quince and his company in a Midsummer Night’s Dream, follows quite another
course. Although the names of the lovers must have been transferred from one story
to the other, it is not certain which was the older (even if one may suspect that the
preceding story was). Ovid’s hero and heroine lived further to the east in any case,
having grown up in adjoining houses in Babylon. When their youthful passion
turned to love and they sought to marry, their parents ordered them to stop asso-
ciating with one another, and they were reduced to communicating through a chink
in the wall that separated their two houses. They ﬁnally arranged to steal away at
night to meet outside the city by the tomb of a certain Ninus, where they could
lie beneath a mulberry-tree that stood beside a cool spring. Thisbe arrived ﬁrst but
was soon scared away when a lioness came down to the spring to quench its thirst
after a kill. The veil that she had been wearing to conceal her features slipped from
her shoulders as she ﬂed; and the lion caught sight of it on the ground and ripped
it to pieces with its blood-stained jaws. When Pyramos arrived and saw the bloodied
fabric lying there with the lion’s footprints all around, he naturally assumed that
his beloved had been devoured and killed himself with his sword. Thisbe returned
as soon as she dared for fear of disappointing her lover, but found him dead on the
ground and killed herself in her turn. After Pyramos had stabbed himself and pulled
the sword from his wound, a stream of blood had gushed out to spatter the fruit
on the mulberry-tree above and to sink into its roots, causing the fruit (which had
— Legends of Greek lands —
578

formerly been white) to turn red; and in response to Thisbe’s dying prayer, the gods
ordained that the ripe fruit of the mulberry should always be a mournful red in
commemoration of the lovers’ fate.156
Strange folk in far places
Strange distorted and monstrous folk were reputed to live at the fringes of the
known world. The elder Pliny (ﬁrst century AD) provides a useful catalogue of these
monstrous races,157 which later found their way into medieval lore; the majority of
them, and certainly the most imaginative, had been introduced into the Greek tradi-
tion by Ctesias and authors of the Hellenistic period who compiled fanciful accounts
of the marvels of the east. Ctesias of Cnidos worked as a physician at the Persian
court at the end of the ﬁfth century BC and wrote a book called the Indika on his
return, which was full of tall tales and helped to establish the enduring notion that
India was a land of wonders. Among the folk who were described in the book were
the Dogheads (Kynokephaloi, or Cynocephali in Latin form), people with dog’s heads
who lived in the mountains of India and communicated by barking rather than
through articulate speech; and the Shadefeet (Skiapodes), who could hop along quite
briskly on their single leg when necessity demanded, but preferred to spend their
time lying on their backs using their single large foot as a parasol; and another race
of people had ears that reached down to their shoulders, and were born with white
hair that turned dark with age. These latter folk reappear in exaggerated form in
the medieval tradition as the Panotii (All-ears), people whose ears were so large that
they could use them as blankets.
If monstrous races such as these were of comparatively late invention, others of a
less extreme nature, the Pygmies and Arimaspians, can be traced back to the archaic
era. The diminutive PYGMIES (Pygmaioi) lived somewhere in Africa. Their small
stature is indicated in their name, which refers to a Greek unit of measurement,
the pygme¯ (ﬁst), corresponding to the distance between a man’s elbow and knuckles.
They are ﬁrst mentioned in a simile in the Iliad, in which the cries of advancing
Trojan warriors are compared to those uttered by cranes as they set off to escape
the winter ‘and ﬂy with much clamour to the Ocean’s streams, bringing death and
slaughter to the Pygmy men’.158 Whether this idea of battles between the cranes
and Pygmies (who would have been of much the same size) was drawn from current
folklore or was simply a passing fancy of Homer’s, it certainly became a central and
enduring feature of Pygmy lore. In vase-paintings and other images from the sixth
century BC onwards, the Pygmies are often shown ﬁghting against the cranes with
clubs, lances and other weapons, or riding against them on goats or rams. They are
usually portrayed in a comical manner as plump little ﬁgures with outsized geni-
tals. A transformation myth was devised in Hellenistic times to account for the feud
between the Pygmies and the cranes. It was explained that there had once been a
Pygmy woman called Oinoe (or Gerana) who had failed to honour Artemis and Hera
and had therefore been turned into a crane by way of punishment; and when she
had then irritated the Pygmies by ﬂuttering around their town in search of her
much-missed infant son Mopsos, they had taken up their clubs to drive her out,
hence the state of war that has existed between the cranes and Pygmies ever since.159

Most authors from Herodotus onwards regarded the Pygmies as an African people;160
whether reports about the real people who have come to be known by that name
ever reached the Greeks by way of Egypt is now impossible to tell. In the only
other myth recorded for them, the Pygmies make a none too serious entry into
heroic mythology as adversaries of Herakles, who tangled with them as he was trav-
elling through North Africa on his way to the Hesperides. When he sank into an
exhausted sleep after his wrestling-match with Antaios (see p. 270), the Pygmies
tried to tie him down, much as the Lilliputians did with Gulliver but with less
success, for Herakles released himself with no great difﬁculty and bundled the little
men into his lionskin to take them home to Greece as a curiosity.161
The one-eyed ARIMASPIANS lived on the opposite side of the world in the far
north. They too engaged in regular hostilities with some animal neighbours, in this
case the fabulous GRIFFINS (grypes), monsters of Near Eastern design with the body
of a lion and the head and wings of an eagle. The trouble arose because the
Arimaspians were constantly trying to steal from large hoards of gold which were
jealously guarded by the Grifﬁns. This story was related in an early hexameter poem,
the Arimaspea, probably dating to the seventh century BC, which told how its reputed
author, Aristeas of Proconnesos, was supposed to have travelled to the far north
while possessed by Apollo. He eventually found himself among the Issedones, who
lived quite close to the Hyperboreans (a mythical people who lived at the northern
edges of the earth, see p. 148); and it was from these Issedones that he learned
about the Arimaspians and Grifﬁns, who inhabited the stretch of land that lay
between his hosts and the Hyperboreans. Although Herodotus reports the story
(along with many other ethnographic curiosities), he is inclined to believe that the
Arimaspians really had two eyes just like everyone else.162
Some foundation-myths from the Italian west
Although there were many foundation-myths that ascribed the founding of cities in
southern Italy and Sicily to heroes from Greek legend, most are of little general
interest, partly because they are late and arbitrary and are rarely accompanied by
memorable stories, and partly because most of them relate to insigniﬁcant places.
Since the Greeks who lived in the main colonies of the west were well aware that
their cities had been founded from speciﬁc regions of the motherland in historical
times, it is understandable that foundation-myths for this area should be concerned
with obscure places (often not even Greek) or with the mythical prehistory of Greek
or Hellenized cities from the time before the Greeks truly arrived.
Most of the foundations in the ﬁrst category are credited to heroes of the Trojan War who
were said (in the later tradition at least) to have wandered west for various reasons after their
return, as in the case of Idomoneus (see p. 355) and Diomedes and Philoktetes (see p. 487).
As we have seen, Diomedes was said to have founded a number of towns in Apulia, a part
of Italy that contained no Greek colonies at all, even if it had come to be extensively
Hellenized by the period at which these myths were devised. For an example of a story from
the second category, relating to the mythical prehistory of Greek colonies, we may turn to
Croton, a prosperous city in toe of Italy (which was colonized by Achaeans from the
Peloponnese at the end of the eighth century BC).

As Herakles was travelling through Italy with the cattle of Geryon after his excursion to
Sicily (see p. 265), he arrived at the site of the future city of Croton, where he was entertained
by the local ruler, Kroton, son of Phaiax (a brother of Alkinoos from Phaeacia); but during
the time of his visit, a certain Lakinios (or Lakinos) tried to steal some of his cattle, provoking
a confrontation in which Herakles accidentally killed his host. By way of atonement, he built
a tomb for him and offered him a splendid funeral, foretelling that a famous city would be
founded there long afterwards under Kroton’s name.163 An almost identical tale was told of
Epizephyrean Locri (founded from Locris at much the same period) further down the coast,
where the hero was said to have killed the city’s eponym, Lokros, son of Phaiax, while trying
to prevent an adventurer, Latinos, from stealing his cattle; in this case, Herakles himself was
said to have ordered the founding of the colony at a later period after he had become a god
on Olympos, indicating his will through an oracle.164 Myths of a rather different kind ascribed
a Greek (or Trojan) pedigree to the original inhabitants of cities or areas that were later settled
by Greeks or came under Greek inﬂuence. According to a relatively early story of this kind,
as attested by Herodotus, the Iapygians and Messapians of Apulia were descended from
Cretans who had been driven ashore there after travelling to Sicily to avenge the death of
Minos (who was supposed to have been murdered in Sicily, see p. 349).165 Far more inter-
esting, however, are the legends that tell of the early history of Segesta (Egesta or Aigesta in
Greek), an important Hellenized city of non-Greek origin in north-western Sicily.
When Aeneas called in at Sicily on his return from Carthage, he was supposed to have
left some of his Trojan followers behind to found the city under the leadership of its eponym,
AIGESTES (or Acestes in Latin), a son of the local river-god Krimisos. The story is told by
Vergil in the ﬁfth book of the Aeneid; in one account, some Greeks who had accompanied
Philoktetes to the west participated in its foundation.166 Aigestes had offered a friendly
welcome to Aeneas because he was himself the son of a Trojan mother, who had arrived in
Sicily in the following circumstances. When Poseidon had sent a sea-monster against Troy
during the reign of Laomedon (see p. 523), an oracle from Apollo had ordered that maidens
of noble birth should be exposed to it, prompting many Trojan noblemen to send their
daughters abroad; among them was a certain Hippotes or Hippostratos, who sent his daughter
Egesta (or Segesta) to Sicily, where the river-god Krimisos had intercourse with her in the
form of a bear or a dog and so caused her to conceive Aigestes.167 Or in a somewhat different
version, a certain Phoinodamas urged his fellow Trojans to expose Laomedon’s daughter
Hesione to the monster, so angering the king that he delivered the three daughters of
Phoinodamas to some sailors, telling them to expose the girls on Sicily as prey to wild
beasts; but they were saved through the will of Aphrodite, and Krimisos fathered Aigestes
by one of them by having intercourse with her in the form of a dog.168
To pass forward to historical times, a memorable and romantic story was recounted
in connection with the founding of Tarentum (or Taras under its Greek name), a
Greek colony on the heel of Italy which was founded at the end of the eighth century
BC by some emigrants from Sparta known as the Partheniai. According to the present
story, the Partheniai were led by a Spartan called PHALANTHOS, who received
an oracle at Delphi before his departure telling him that he would win a land and
city for himself when rain fell on him from a clear sky. Although he met with some
success in battle after his arrival in Italy, he failed to capture any city or territory
and grew increasingly despondent, suspecting that the god at Delphi had set an
impossible condition for his success. One day, however, as he was lying with his
head in his wife’s lap to enable her to pick the lice from his hair, he felt her tears
pattering down on him as she wept at the failure of his hopes; and since her name

was Aithra (which means Clear Sky in Greek), he suddenly realized that her tears
must be the ‘rain’ that the oracle had referred to. So he returned to battle with
renewed conﬁdence, to such effect that he captured Tarentum from its native inhab-
itants on the very next night and founded a Greek city there.169
Arion and the dolphin; two ghost-stories from Greek 
colonies in Italy
Many of the Greek cities of Italy and Sicily grew wealthy and were able to support a
ﬂourishing cultural life. Among the artists and writers who sought to beneﬁt from
their patronage was ARION of Methymna, a lyric poet of the seventh century BC,
who was born on Lesbos but spent most of his life at the court of Periandros
(Periander), the ruthless but cultivated tyrant of Corinth. At one time, so the story
goes, Arion made a tour of Sicily and Italy, amassing a considerable proﬁt from his
recitations, until he ﬁnally set off for Greece in a Corinthian ship that was sailing out
of Tarentum. When it reached the open sea, he came to realize that the sailors were
plotting to throw him overboard in order to steal his money. After vainly urging
them to accept his money in return for his life, he asked them to permit him to give
a last recital on the deck in his magniﬁcent singing-robes, saying that he would then
take his own life by leaping into the sea. As soon as he fell into the water, however,
he was rescued by a dolphin which had been attracted by the sound of his music; and
it took him on its back and carried him to Greece, putting him ashore at Cape
Tainaron at the southern tip of the Peloponnese. He hurried back to Corinth and told
the whole story to Periandros, who was reluctant to believe him until he could inter-
rogate the crew of the ship. When they claimed on their arrival that they had left
Arion safe and sound at Tarentum, the poet suddenly revealed himself wearing the
robes that he had donned for his farewell recital. Their lies were thus exposed in a
most dramatic fashion, and Periandros sentenced them to death.170
Such is the standard version of the story as recounted by Herodotus. Later authors adapted it
to explain the origin of the constellation of the Dolphin (Delphinus), saying that Apollo, the
divine patron of poets, rewarded the dolphin for its rescue of Arion by transferring it to the
stars.171 Visitors to Tainaron could see a bronze statue of a man on a dolphin that had suppos-
edly been dedicated by Arion.172 Ancient writers have much to say about dolphins, which
were known to be friendly to human beings and were reputed to be fond of music. Some
dolphin stories were legendary like that of Arion or a tale recorded for Enalos, one of the
legendary ﬁrst colonists of Lesbos (the Penthilidai, p. 515); after a girl whom he loved was
hurled into the sea in obedience to an oracle, Enalos tried to kill himself by throwing himself
into the sea after her, but he and his beloved were both rescued by dolphins that carried them
to the shore.173 Other stories were based on fact, as in the case of Pliny’s sad tale of the dolphin
of Hippo Diarrhytus (an African coastal town not far from Carthage) which proved too
friendly for its own good. For by allowing people to stroke it and feed it, and even to ride on
its back, it attracted so many visitors to the town that the citizens, who were obliged to enter-
tain visitors of high rank who came to see it, ﬁnally killed it because they could no longer
afford the expense.174
Our last two legends are in effect ghost-stories, for both tell how people from the
historical era were supposed to have come into contact, violent and otherwise, with
— Legends of Greek lands —
582

dead ﬁgures from the mythical past; the stories are connected with cities on either
side of the toe of Italy, one with Epizephyrean Locri on the east coast and the other
with Temesa on the west.
Believing that their colony had been founded from Naryx in Eastern Locris, the
birthplace of the Locrian Aias, a violent hero of the Trojan War (see p. 456), the men
of Epizephyrean Locri used to leave an empty space in their battle-line in the hope
that their ancestral hero would come to their assistance. One day (so the story goes),
as they were ﬁghting against an army from Croton, a Crotoniate called AUTOLEON
(or Leonymos) tried to rush through the empty space to attack the enemy line from
the rear, but was severely wounded in the thigh (or chest) by the long-dead Aias.
When the festering wound failed to heal, he consulted an oracle (or the Delphic oracle
speciﬁcally), which advised him to seek a cure from Aias himself on Leuke (the White
Island), an island in the Black Sea which was the posthumous home of Achilles and
other great heroes of the Trojan War (see p. 116). On arriving at the island, he offered
sacriﬁce to these inhabitants and above all to Aias, who duly healed him of his wound.
Now Helen was living there too, as the posthumous consort of Achilles, and she took
advantage of Autoleon’s visit to ask him to take a message to the poet Stesichorus,
who lived in Sicily no great distance from Autoleon’s home-town. For she had blinded
Stesichorus for insulting her in one of his poems, and she now wanted him to know
that he would recover his sight if he composed a recantation. It was as a consequence
of this message, so the story claims, that Stesichorus wrote his famous Palinode, or
poem of recantation, in which he asserted that the Helen who had eloped with Paris
was a mere phantom rather than the heroine herself (see further on p. 445). By virtue
of this connection, it can be inferred that these events must have taken place in the
ﬁrst half of the sixth century BC.175
The little town of Temesa, which was founded from Croton, was troubled during
much of its earlier history by an aggressive ghost, the so-called HERO OF TEMESA.
The problem began when Odysseus and his followers called in at the town in the
course of their wanderings, and one of them, a certain Polites (who is mentioned
in the Odyssey as a victim of Kirke’s enchantments) got drunk and raped a local girl;
for the inhabitants responded by stoning him to death, and his angry spirit subjected
them to a reign of terror by way of revenge, committing murders and attacking old
and young alike. Although the Temesians were initially inclined to abandon their
town and leave Italy altogether, the Delphic oracle advised them to appease their
tormentor by honouring him as a hero, and building him a shrine and presenting
the most beautiful of their maidens to him each year as a bride in death. This proved
effective, and the latter custom was maintained (so the story claims) until a famous
boxer called Euthymos (a historical ﬁgure who won an Olympian victory in the ﬁfth
century BC) happened to visit Temesa when the Hero of Temesa was just about to
receive one of his brides. Feeling pity for her at ﬁrst, and then falling in love with
her, he offered to save her if she would marry him afterwards. So he lay in wait at
the shrine in place of her, and when the Hero arrived for his victim, gave him such
a drubbing that he ﬂed the land and plunged beneath the waves, never to return.
Or in another account, Euthymos fought with the Hero because he had been exacting
a tribute from the local people, and forced him to repay all the money with interest.
The shrine of Polites could still be seen at Temesa in Roman times.176

AENEAS, ROMULUS 
AND THE ORIGINS 
OF ROME

M
any of the legends of early Rome were modelled more or less directly on older
stories from Greece, and the same is also true of the relatively few original
myths that came to be developed about the Roman gods (mainly by Ovid in the
surviving literature); but even if the associated bodies of legend were partly of a
hybrid nature as a consequence, they belong to the Roman tradition rather than the
Greek and must be interpreted in relation to Roman concerns, and therefore lie
beyond the scope of a survey of Greek myth. Of rather greater relevance to our
concerns, perhaps, are Roman aetiological tales that added a Roman extension to
Greek myth by bringing Greek heroes in person to Rome or Latium. We have had
occasion to refer to the remarkable appendix to the legend of Hippolytos, son of
Theseus, in which he was said to have been transferred to Latium after his death
and revival to become a cultic associate of Diana, the local equivalent of his patron
goddess Artemis, at her sacred grove at Aricia (see p. 359). To explain another
feature of the grove, it was also suggested that Orestes deposited the statue of
Taurian Artemis there after stealing it from its original home with help of his sister
Iphigeneia (see p. 514). Herakles, who was honoured in Roman cult as Hercules,
might be very naturally imagined as having visited the site of Rome as he was trav-
elling through Italy with the cattle of Geryon. Roman authors took advantage of
this possibility to propose not only that his most ancient cult had come to be
founded there as a consequence, but also that he had modiﬁed certain native rites
involving human sacriﬁce (so providing an explanation, for instance, for a ritual
practice in which straw puppets were cast into the Tiber from a Roman bridge). As
we saw in connection with the former story, the site of the future city was said to
have been ruled at this time by a Greek, Evander (see p. 266), who had left his
native city of Pallantion in Arcadia to settle on the Palatine hill. By far the most
important legend of this kind, however, and one that cannot possibly be passed over
without a proper examination, is that in which AINEIAS, a Trojan hero from Greek
myth, was said to have travelled to Latium after the fall of Troy and to have come
to be connected, however distantly, with the origins of Rome itself.
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
584

Greek legends that associated Aineias with the founding 
of Rome, and their chronological implausibility
Aineias was the leading member of the junior branch of the Trojan royal family at
the time of the great war between Greece and Troy (see p. 453); he had been borne
to Anchises, a great-grandson of Tros, by the goddess Aphrodite (see pp. 200–1 for
the circumstances of his conception). In his original Greek legend, he was marked
out from other male members of the royal family not so much by his personal qual-
ities as by the fact that he was destined to survive; for someone needed to be available
to rule the Trojans after the fall of Troy and the destruction of Priam’s senior branch
of the family. In one of the battle-scenes in the Iliad, the great god Poseidon, who
is normally no friend of the Trojans, rescues Aineias from danger for that very reason,
stating that it is ordained that he shall survive so that the race of Dardanos (the
founder of the Trojan royal line) shall not perish in its entirety;1 and the same
conclusion can be drawn from an episode in the Sack of Troy, a lost epic in the
Trojan cycle, in which Aineias and his followers withdraw from Troy before its fall
in response to a portent (see p. 475).2 In the Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite, which tells
how Aphrodite came to bear Aineias to Anchises (see p. 200), the goddess proph-
esies correspondingly to Anchises that his son and descendants will reign among
the Trojans.3 In the usual tradition from the classical period onwards, Aineias was
still in Troy on the night of the sack, as in Vergil’s account in the Aeneid, but
escaped through the carnage with his aged father on his back, taking the household
gods with him. Authors from Xenophon onwards report that the Greeks allowed
him safe passage because they so admired his piety in trying to save his father and
household gods.4 This Greek tradition about his conduct on that fateful night
provided the basis for the Roman characterization of the just and dutiful Aeneas.
If Aineias survived the war, he was available to be transferred abroad as the myth-
ical tradition evolved. Largely to explain the origin of local cults or dedications, or
of place-names that seemed to have some connection with Aineias, it came to be
suggested that he had settled in neighbouring Thrace or in a variety of places in
Greece itself. The stories that presently concern us, however, are those that take
him further abroad to Italy, and connect him in one way or another with the
founding of Rome.
Much as one would like to be able to trace how the Italian legend of Aineias ﬁrst
developed in the Greek tradition, the surviving evidence is so inadequate that this
is hardly possible. Inscriptions on the Tabula Iliaca Capitolina, an Italian limestone
relief dating from about 15 BC, seem to suggest that Stesichorus, a Greek-Sicilian
poet of the sixth century BC, already presented Aineias as sailing off to Hesperia
(i.e. the Italian West);5 but it has been convincingly argued on a variety of grounds
that we cannot rely on this monument for reliable information on what Stesichorus
may have said about Aineias. It has been observed, furthermore, that if Stesi-
chorus had really presented Aineias as sailing to Italy, Dionysius of Halicarnassus,
who was well acquainted with his work, could hardly have failed to mention it in
his detailed survey of Aineias’s Italian legend. Dionysius is our source for the next
earliest report, for he cites the mythographer Hellanicus (ﬁfth century BC) as having
written that Aineias sailed to Italy with Odysseus and became the founder of Rome;

he named it after one of the Trojan women who had accompanied him, a certain
Rhome, who had grown weary of their long wanderings and had brought them to
an end in Latium by inciting the other women to set ﬁre to the Trojan ships.6 Once
again, alas, there is ample reason to doubt the reliability of the attribution, both
on internal grounds and because Dionysius also ascribes a conﬂicting story to
Hellanicus in which Aineias settles closer to home at Pallene on the northern shores
of the Aegean.7
Whatever the true origin of the story above in which Aineias founded Rome and
named it after Rhome, it is characteristic of the facile pseudo-legends that were
invented by Greek authors to account for the origin of Rome (as of other foreign
cities). Some thirty stories of the kind are recorded from the Hellenistic and early
Roman period, not all involving Aineias. To Greeks who were versed in the
legendary lore of their own land, it seemed self-evident that just as Corinth was
named after Korinthos, or Chaironeia after Chairon, or Cyrene after a nymph called
Kyrene, so Rome must have been named after someone called Rhome or Rhomos
or the like.8 As the next stage in the process, it was necessary that some kind of
pedigree or origin should be ascribed to the chosen eponym, and that appropriate
circumstances should be imagined for the founding of the city that was supposedly
named after that person. For a far-off place like Rome, no detail was required in
the latter connection, and certainly none that demanded any knowledge of the local
traditions and topography. In foundation-stories of this nature in which Rhome is
selected as the eponym, she is usually linked to Aineias in one way or another,
whether as a companion of his as above, or as his wife, or as the wife or daughter
of his son Askanios. In that case, the city could be said to have been founded by
Aineias or Askanios and named in her honour.9 There are also accounts, however,
in which she has nothing to do with Aineias, being described, for instance, as a
captive who had been brought from Troy by Greek warriors, or as a daughter of
Euandros (an Arcadian hero who was supposed to have established himself on the
site of Rome).10 Similar considerations apply to the male eponym Rhomos, who
may either be connected with Aineias as a son or grandson of his or else be given
an entirely different pedigree, as a son of Odysseus and Kirke, for instance, or of
Emathion.11 When Rhomos is the eponym, he founds the city himself.
It would be pointless to attempt to trace all the permutations. A certain Romanos, son of
Odysseus and Kirke, is also mentioned as the eponymous founder, as is Romis, tyrant of the
Latins, who drove the Etruscans from the area to found the new city.12 As the latter example
would indicate, the founder or eponym may be given a native pedigree. There are versions,
for example, in which Rhome and Rhomos are described as children of Italos, the eponym of
Italy, or the city is said to have been of Etruscan foundation.13 Or else it was founded by some
Pelasgians (aboriginals) who named it Rome in commemoration of their military strength
(rho¯me¯, a purely Greek etymology).14 But that is quite enough of this nonsense.
Most of these Greek accounts of the founding of Rome are either anonymous or are ascribed
to obscure writers who are hard to date. If it is accepted that the account ascribed to
Hellanicus is of doubtful origin, the earliest datable version is one that is recorded for the
minor historian Callias, who would have been writing around 300 BC (see p. 602).
— Aeneas, Romulus and the origins of Rome —
586

Although the Romans came to accept that Aineias and his Trojans had some connec-
tion with the origins of their city, the idea that it was actually founded by Aineias
(or an immediate descendant or associate of his) was a purely Greek idea which
never seems to have been taken very seriously at Rome itself. In the surviving Roman
literature, no author apart from the historian Sallust ever refers to Aineias as
founder.15 It has been argued, to be sure, that the Romans did regard him as their
founder in early times, adopting him as such under Etruscan inﬂuence before putting
him aside for Romulus, but this is a hazardous speculation in the absence of any
deﬁnite evidence from the city itself, whether literary or archaeological. The Romans
developed a foundation myth of their own in any case, in which the founding was
ascribed to Romulus, a Latin prince from Alba Longa. It is generally believed nowa-
days that this was a legend of indigenous origin and respectable antiquity, perhaps
dating back to the sixth century BC; and it is known for certain that the story was
well-established by the end of the fourth century (see p. 602). In contrast to the
Greek stories mentioned above, which would never have been more than rudimen-
tary, this Roman legend was rich in content and grew ever more so, making extensive
reference to the local topography and traditions, and embracing many local aeti-
ologies. It overshadowed all other stories of the kind, leaving them as no more than
historical curiosities; for not only was it bound to impose itself at the expense of
arbitrarily invented foreign stories, but chronological researches showed ever more
clearly that Rome could not possibly have been founded by Aineias or a near contem-
porary of his as most Greek stories suggested.
On any rational chronology, Rome must have been founded considerably later
than the period immediately following the fall of Troy (i.e. the closing stages of
the era of legend in Greece). The historian Timaeus (died c. 260 BC), a Greek-
Sicilian who had a good knowledge of the local traditions in Italy, dated the founding
of Rome to 814 BC, while Roman antiquaries during the following two centuries
came to favour a somewhat later date, ﬁnally accepting Varro’s estimate of 754/3
BC as canonic. By any calculation, the heroes of Trojan legend must have lived in
a remoter antiquity than this. According to the most widely accepted chronology,
as developed by Eratosthenes of Alexandria in the third century BC, Troy fell in
1184 BC (towards the end of the Mycenaean period in our reckoning, which seems
appropriate enough). If a connection was to be established between Aineias and the
founding of Rome, this meant that there was a gap of at least four centuries to be
ﬁlled between the time of his arrival in Italy and the actual foundation of the city.
In what came to be accepted as the standard Roman account, the founder Romulus
(who would originally have had no connection whatever with Aineias or Troy) was
considered to be a fairly distant descendant of Aineias who founded Rome many
generations after his Trojan forebear had emigrated to that area. After arriving in
Latium, the territory on the east coast of Italy in which Rome would later be located,
Aineias (or Aeneas in Latin) established himself there with his Trojan followers after
some initial conﬂict with the native Italians. Not far from the coast near the site
of his ﬁrst landing, he founded the city of Lavinium as his new home and centre
of rule. His son and successor Askanios (or Ascanius in Latin) did not remain at
Lavinium, however, but ventured further inland to found Alba Longa, about twelve
miles south-east of the site of Rome. Descendants of Aeneas ruled Alba for some

twelve generations thereafter until Romulus was born into the family under perilous
circumstances while his father was temporarily excluded from his rightful throne.
Romulus survived nonetheless to found the city of Rome, peopling it initially with
settlers from Alba.
Aeneas’ travels and arrival in Latium as described by Vergil
The Roman legend of Aeneas may be approached most conveniently through the
Aeneid, which tells how he wandered to the west after the destruction of Troy and
established himself in Latium. We may call him Aeneas henceforth in accordance
with Latin usage, and follow the same procedure when referring to other ﬁgures
from Greek legend who appear in the story.
After the fall of Troy, Aeneas and other Trojan survivors constructed a ﬂeet of
ships and sailed off to seek a new home. Although Aeneas initially wanted to settle
nearby on the southern coast of Thrace, Polydorus, a son of Priam who had been
treacherously murdered there (see p. 479), spoke up from his grave to warn him to
forsake that savage land. So he sailed southward, calling in next at the holy island
of Delos, where he received a friendly welcome from the priest-king Anius (see 
p. 569). When Aeneas entered the temple of Apollo to pray for guidance, a super-
natural voice ordered him and his followers to seek out the land of their ancestors,
declaring that his descendants were destined to rule the world from it. On being
reminded by his father Anchises that Troy had originally been settled from Crete
by Teucer (Teukros, see p. 521), he led his fellow Trojans to that island and
proceeded to found a city there, but the newcomers were soon afﬂicted by a famine
and a plague. The signiﬁcance of this was revealed when the family gods of Aeneas
appeared to him in a dream one night and told him that Delian Apollo had not
intended him to settle in Crete but rather in Italy, for that had been the original
homeland of his ancestor Dardanus, the founder of the Trojan royal line. Although
Dardanus was supposed to have crossed over from Samothrace in the Greek tradi-
tion (see p. 521), Vergil is referring to an Etrusco-Roman story in which he was
presented as having come from Corythus in Etruria (apparently Tarquinii, though
often identiﬁed with Cortona).16
As the Trojans were sailing west from Crete, they were caught by a storm and
driven in a north-westerly direction around the Peloponnese to the little islands of
the Strophades, where they were confronted by the Harpies, ﬁerce bird-like crea-
tures with women’s faces (see p. 57), who pillaged and fouled their food much as
in the legend of Phineus (see p. 386). When these pests were ﬁnally driven off, their
leader, Celaeno, cast fear into the Trojans by telling them that Apollo had revealed
that hunger would drive them to ‘eat their tables’ before they would be able to
found their Italian city. The meaning of these enigmatic words will become apparent
shortly.17 The wanderers called in next at Epirus in north-western Greece, where
they found that Helenus, a son of Priam, was now ruling the kingdom that had
been established there by Neoptolemus (see further on pp. 489–90), and was married
to Hector’s widow Andromache. He had assuaged his nostalgia for his homeland 
by building an imitation of the Trojan citadel and by naming features of the land-
scape after corresponding features at Troy. Through his powers as a seer, he was
— Aeneas, Romulus and the origins of Rome —
588

able to advise Aeneas about his forthcoming journey, telling him above all that he
should found his new city where he saw a huge white sow lying on the ground
suckling thirty piglets. While making his way to that place, which would be located
somewhere on the far coast of Italy, he should visit the Sibyl of Cumae, who would
be able to reveal more about the ordeals that awaited him in Italy.18
Aeneas and his followers then sailed around the foot of Italy and the southern
shores of Sicily, narrowly avoiding the whirlpool Charybdis and observing
Polyphemus and other Cyclopes from afar (for it was supposed in the later tradi-
tion that the Homeric Kyklopes had lived in Sicily). When the voyagers arrived at
Drepanum on the western corner of Sicily, they received a hospitable reception from
a local ruler called Acestes, who was of Trojan descent through his mother (see p.
581). The aged Anchises died soon afterwards and was buried there.19 Aeneas set
sail for western Italy in the following year, but the goddess Juno (the Roman equiv-
alent of Hera), who had long hated the Trojans, persuaded Aeolus, the ruler of the
winds, to unleash a violent storm in the hope of wrecking the ﬂeet; but though
some of the ships were destroyed, Neptune calmed the storm, and Aeneas made for
the nearest shore with the seven surviving vessels, making a safe landfall on the
African coast near Carthage. The newly established city was ruled by its founder,
Dido, a Phoenician princess from Tyre, who welcomed the seafarers to her city and
fell desperately in love with Aeneas at the incitation of Venus. On ﬁnding himself
alone with her when the two of them entered the same cave to escape a thunder-
storm while out hunting, he embarked on a love affair with her; but after he had
tarried with her for some months, Jupiter sent Mercury (the Roman equivalent of
Hermes) to him to recall him to his appointed task. He responded to the call of
duty and prepared to set off, ignoring the pleas of Dido, who killed herself with
his sword after his departure.20
After arriving back in Sicily, Aeneas held funeral games in honour of his father
on the anniversary of his death. The Trojan women, who had grown tired of their
endless wanderings, set ﬁre to the ships at the incitation of Juno while the games
were under way; but Aeneas prayed for the assistance of Jupiter, who sent a rain-
storm to douse the ﬂames, and all but four of the ships were saved. Leaving his
older and weaker followers behind to found the city of Acesta (i.e. Segesta) under
the leadership of Acestes, Aeneas now set out for Italy once again.21 In accordance
with the advice that he had received from Helenus, he called in ﬁrst at Cumae, just
to the north of the Bay of Naples, where the Cumaean Sibyl delivered prophecies
to him about his future adventures in Latium; and in response to his urgent request,
she agreed to guide him down to the Underworld for a reunion with his dead father.
His journey through the different regions of the Underworld has already been
described (see pp. 123ff). At the end of it, his father was able to encourage him by
offering him a preview of the glorious destiny of his family and of Rome.22 After
he escaped back into the upper world, he and his followers sailed up the coast to
the mouth of the Tiber and landed in Latium. As they were eating an improvised
meal in the open air nearby, seated on the grass and using ﬂat cakes of bread as
platters, they felt so hungry that they ﬁnished off by eating the platters themselves,
causing the son of Aeneas to joke that they were even devouring their tables; and
on hearing his words, Aeneas suddenly realized that the Harpy’s prophecy had been

fulﬁlled and that they had therefore discovered their new homeland. And before
long, he found the sow and thirty piglets that had been foretold by Helenus as indi-
cating the site of his new home-city of Lavinium.23
Since Latinus, the aged king of Latium, had been advised by an oracle to marry
his daughter Lavinia to a foreigner, he welcomed the envoys of Aeneas and let them
know that he was willing to accept him as a friend and quite possibly as his son-
in-law also. Before matters could be taken any further, however, Juno intervened
once again by sending the Fury Allecto to the area to stir up trouble against the
Trojans. Allecto inspired a ﬁerce hatred for them in Amata, the wife of Latinus, and
likewise in Turnus, prince of the Rutulians, who had been the favoured suitor of
Lavinia up until that time; and when the Fury then incited Ascanius, the son of
Aeneas, to shoot a pet stag that belonged to the royal family, open warfare ensued.
Aeneas found himself confronted by a confederation of the Latins, the Rutulians,
and the followers of Mezentius, a tyrannous Etruscan ruler who had been exiled
from his native city of Caere.24 He acquired some allies of his own, however,
including Tarchon, an Etruscan king who had learned from a diviner that he would
defeat his enemy Mezentius if he took a foreigner as his leader, and Evander, the
ruler of the present inhabitants of the site of Rome. Since Evander was too old to
ﬁght on his own account, he provided a force of cavalry under the command of his
son Pallas. Latinus stood apart from the conﬂict. After ﬁerce ﬁghting and various
shifts of fortune, Aeneas defeated his opponents, sealing his victory by killing Turnus
in single combat (the culminating episode that marks the end of the Aeneid). He
then proceeded to marry Latinus’ daughter after making peace on terms that were
very favourable to the conquered Latins, who were to retain their names and customs
but to accept the gods and sacred rites that Aeneas had brought to their land.
Latinus, the eponym of Latium and the Latins, is a fairly ancient ﬁgure who is ﬁrst mentioned
at the end of Hesiod’s Theogony (in a section of the poem that was probably added in the 
sixth century BC); he is there described as a son of Odysseus and Kirke ‘who ruled over 
the famous Tyrrhenians (i.e. Etruscans) very far off in a nook of the holy islands’.25 The
author’s knowledge of the geography of the west was evidently very deﬁcient. Latinus was 
also described as a son of Telemachos and Kirke26 or else given a native pedigree as a son of
Faunus, a rustic godling who was equated with the Greek Pan; according to the Aeneid,
Latinus fathered him by a Laurentine water-nymph called Marica.27 A further tradition
suggested that Hercules fathered him by the wife or daughter of Faunus (presumably meaning
Fauna in either case).28
Since the story of Aeneas’ conﬂict with the Italians had no foundation either in history
or in any old tradition, different authors could remodel it to suit themselves, and the role
of Latinus varies accordingly. In Cato’s version, Latinus granted a friendly reception to the
Trojans, allocating land to them and offering his daughter Lavinia to Aeneas; but when 
the Trojans subsequently broke faith with him by raiding the Latin territories, Latinus made
war on them, forming an alliance for that purpose with Turnus, lord of the Rutulians, who
bore a grudge against Aeneas for having married Lavinia; and Latinus and Turnus were both
killed in the ensuing conﬂict.29 Or in Dionysius’ account, Latinus was ﬁghting a war against
the Rutulians at the time of the Trojans’ arrival but broke it off to march against the
foreigners. On the night before he was due to engage them in battle, however, both he and
Aeneas were visited in their sleep by gods who instructed them to reach a peaceful settle-
ment. So Latinus granted territory to the Trojans, who now became his allies and helped
— Aeneas, Romulus and the origins of Rome —
590

him to defeat the Rutulians.30 Vergil departs from the earlier tradition by presenting Latinus
as an old man who takes no part in the ﬁghting.
Although the Aeneid ends with Aeneas’s victory over his Italian foes, the destiny
that lies in wait for him and his descendants is not merely presupposed but is expli-
citly foretold within the poem. It is indicated that he will found his city of Lavinium
in accordance with the sign foretold for him by Helenus; and shortly before he
discovers the sow and thirty piglets, the god of the river Tiber explains to him that
the sign means that his son Ascanius will found Alba thirty years after the founding
of Lavinium.31 While Aeneas is making his visit to the Underworld, furthermore,
his dead father Anchises offers him a vision of the future of his family and of Rome
by telling him of the destinies that await various souls who are due to be reborn
into earthly bodies.32 Anchises points ﬁrst to Silvius, the posthumous son of Aeneas
who will found the line of kings that will rule in Alba Longa;33 and he then iden-
tiﬁes a few of these kings by name before pointing to Romulus as the divinely
fathered member of the family who will found Rome itself.34 The pageant continues
with the legendary kings of Rome and a selection of its foremost men down to
Julius Caesar and Augustus; as we will see, the Julians claimed to be descended
from Aeneas.
Aeneas’ city of Lavinium, and his death and apotheosis
Lavinium was an old Latin city that lay near the coast about seventeen miles south
of Rome, at the site of the modern Pratica di Mare; Aeneas was said to have named
it after his second wife Lavinia. Although the city’s Trojan legend was presumably
quite ancient, nothing is known for certain about its time of origin. The Greek-
Sicilian historian Timaeus, who visited Lavinium in the ﬁrst half of the third century
BC to investigate its antiquities, provides the earliest deﬁnite evidence for Aeneas’
connection with the town. It had become accepted by that time that Aeneas had
not only founded the city itself but had deposited his household gods there to found
its ‘Trojan’ cult of the Penates; Timaeus was shown the earthenware pots in which
he was supposed to have transported them from Troy.35 Knowledge of him must
have reached the area considerably earlier, whether by way of Etruria, where he was
well known by the end of the sixth century BC, or of the Greek colonies in the
south; but archaeological investigations have failed to provide any unequivocal early
evidence for his presence in Lavinium. After ﬁrst stepping ashore in Latium, Aeneas
and his followers were said to have camped at a place called Troia, which lay a few
miles down the coast between Lavinium and Ardea.36 If the place had acquired its
name before the legend of Aeneas had become established in the area, as is certainly
possible from a linguistic point of view, its presence may have suggested or at least
encouraged the idea that Aeneas had settled in the vicinity.
In the Aeneid, as we have seen, Aeneas was told by the seer Helenus that he should
found his city at the place where he found a large white sow with thirty young. 
Or in the accounts offered by Dionysius and Diodorus,37 which seem to reﬂect the
inﬂuence of Greek tales of animal-guides (as in the Theban foundation legend, see

p. 295), Aeneas was advised by an oracle that a four-footed animal would lead him
to the site of his city; and when a pregnant white sow escaped as he was bringing
it to sacriﬁce after his landing and then ﬂed to a certain hill where it gave birth to
thirty young, he called the oracle to mind and resolved to found his city there. In
what was perhaps the earliest form of the myth, the thirty piglets symbolized the
thirty cities that would subsequently form the Latin League;38 but the number was
more commonly thought to have a chronological signiﬁcance. In the version ascribed
to the Roman historian Fabius Pictor (writing in about 200 BC or slightly earlier),
Aeneas received a vision in his sleep that ordered him to delay the founding of his
city for thirty years in accordance with the number of the piglets.39 Or in the Aeneid,
the god of the Tiber appeared to him in his sleep on the night before he saw the
portent, and explained that it indicated that he should found Lavinium at that site
while his son Ascanius should found Alba thirty years later.40 In that case, it could
be said that Alba was named after the white (alba) sow.41 Whether or not the story
of the sow originated as a genuine local legend, it certainly came to be accepted at
Lavinium as a highly valued feature of the city’s foundation legend. The antiquarian
Varro, writing in the ﬁrst century BC, reports that there were not only statues of
the sow and its young in the town but that the corpse of the sow itself could be
seen there, pickled in brine.42
The grave and shrine of Aeneas could be seen near Lavinium beside a local stream,
the Numicus or Numicius. He was honoured there as a minor deity under the name
of Aeneas Indiges, having displaced the former occupant of the shrine, who had
been called Pater Indiges or the like. According to Dionysius, there was a mound
of no great size surrounded by a handsome and neatly ordered grove of trees, and
the shrine was marked with the following inscription: ‘to the father and god of the
locality, who presides over the waters of the river Numicius’.43 It was said that
Aeneas had disappeared into the waters of the stream, evidently because his shrine
was set on its bank; or in rationalistic accounts, it could be explained that he had
simply been carried away by the stream after being killed in battle beside it. A
fourth-century BC shrine set in a tumulus near Lavinium has sometimes been iden-
tiﬁed with the shrine of Aeneas, but this is highly questionable, especially since the
excavated site is not situated near a stream. Although Aeneas was not honoured as
a hero or god in Roman cult, the Augustan poets tell of his apotheosis. In the
Aeneid, Jupiter announces to his mother Venus (the Roman goddess equated with
Aphrodite) that he is destined to be raised up to the heavens as a god; and in Ovid’s
Metamorphoses, Venus prepares for his apotheosis by asking the god of the Numicius
to wash every mortal element out of his corpse.44
There were long-established cultic connections between Rome and Lavinium. In
accordance with a practice which may well have been inaugurated when the Romans
ﬁrst gained control over Lavinium, a party of senior magistrates and priests would
travel from Rome each year to perform various traditional rites in the town, above
all to offer sacriﬁces to Vesta and the Penates.45 Vesta was the goddess of the hearth,
the Italian equivalent of Hestia (see p. 139), while the Penates were deities who
had originated as guardian-spirits of the store-room (penus). They and the goddess
were honoured both in domestic cult as protectors of the household in accordance
— Aeneas, Romulus and the origins of Rome —
592

with their original nature, and in public cult as deities of wider importance who
watched over the city and state. Now the Romans believed that their state Penates,
the Penates publici, had come from Lavinium, and that they could be identiﬁed with
the Trojan gods who had been established there by Aeneas. There may have been
a measure of truth in this, to the extent that the state cult of the Penates may have
been introduced from Lavinium or at least reorganized in connection with the
Lavinian cult.
Ascanius, son of Aeneas, and the founding of Alba Longa
The founding of Alba Longa marks the next stage in the legend. In contrast to
Lavinium, Alba had once been a powerful place, and it was believed that Rome and
various other Latin cities had been founded from it. Since Roman tradition stated
accordingly that the founder Romulus was of Alban descent, any linkage with Aeneas
and the Trojans had to be established by way of Alba, by making Romulus and 
his Alban forebears descendants of Aeneas. Through the harmonization of Greek,
Roman and Lavinate traditions, the canonic pattern was thus established in 
which Aeneas founded Lavinium while his son ASCANIUS founded Alba and his
descendant Romulus founded Rome. It is not necessary to assume that Alba Longa
(which was destroyed by the Romans at quite an early period) ever had a Trojan
legend of its own in the same way as Lavinium. If Alban families at Rome such as
the Julii and Cloelii claimed Trojan descent, it is surely more probable that this
was a late development inspired by antiquarian lore than an ancient claim rooted
in Alban tradition.
Ascanius (as Askanios was known in Latin) was taken over from the Greek tradi-
tion. Although Homer makes no mention of him or indeed of any son of Aineias
(referring only to an Askanios who was a Bithynian ally of the Trojans46), it is
reasonable to assume that he was named in early epic as Aineias’ heir. Aineias
certainly had such an heir in the early tradition since the Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite
presents the goddess as telling Anchises that his son (i.e. Aineias) and descendants
will rule among the Trojans;47 and Askanios is the name that is invariably given
to this son of Aineias from the classical period onwards. When it came to be imag-
ined that Aineias had settled abroad after the fall of Troy rather than staying to
rule in the Troad, Askanios was naturally said to have accompanied him, and he
was thus available to become the founder of Alba in Italian legend. In the usual
tradition, as would be expected, Aeneas was said to have fathered Askanios by his
Trojan wife, who was originally known as Eurydike, but later as Kreousa (or Creusa
in Latin, as in the Aeneid).
Various explanations were put forward to account for Ascanius’ action in leaving
Lavinium to found a new city. In the version favoured by Vergil and Dionysius, he
founded Alba thirty years after the founding of Lavinium because his father had
received a prophecy revealing that the portent of the sow and piglets indicated that
he should do so.48 Or according to another tradition, he decided to leave Lavinium
when trouble arose between him and his father’s Italian widow. For Lavinia, who
was pregnant at the time of her husband’s death, ﬂed into the woods for fear of her

stepson’s jealousy, and gave birth to her child there, who was known as Silvius (‘he
of the woods’) as a consequence; and since Ascanius met with hostility from the
people of Lavinium as a result of the queen’s plight, he invited her back to take
over the throne and went off to found a new city of his own.49
Livy records a divergent account in which Ascanius was born in Italy as Aeneas’ son by
Lavinia and Silvius was a son of Ascanius. In this version, Ascanius was too young to take
power at the time of his father’s death, and Lavinia ruled on his behalf as regent until 
he came of age; and when he eventually departed to found the new settlement at Alba, he
restored Lavinium to the capable charge of his mother.50 To understand the likely origin of
this unorthodox version, it is necessary to consider a further aspect of Ascanius’ Italian legend.
Julius Caesar belonged to the gens Julia, a family of Alban origin, as did Augustus through
his mother’s line and by adoption; and this family claimed descent from Ascanius by equating
him with Iulus, the legendary founder of their line. It was explained in this connection that
Ascanius had been called Ilus (i.e. man of Ilion or Troy) during his Trojan years, and that
this alternative name of his was altered slightly to Iulus in his new homeland. Now if Aeneas
fathered Ascanius by his Italian wife rather than by his ﬁrst wife at Troy, Ascanius could
not be identiﬁed with Iulus in this way; so it would seem that this was an anti-Julian version
that was developed to exclude the identiﬁcation.
Since Ascanius might have been expected to take his household gods with him, a
story was devised to explain why the ‘Trojan’ cult of the Penates remained in
Lavinium. Although Ascanius ordered that a special temple should be constructed
for them at Alba and proceeded to install them there, they ﬂed back to their previous
home of their own accord during the night; for it was discovered on the following
morning that they had disappeared (even though the doors of the temple had been
kept shut, and its walls and roof remained intact), and it was soon reported from
Lavinium that they were standing once again on their original pedestals. After they
ran back to their original home for a second time, they were allowed to remain
there, and six hundred men were sent back with their families to attend to their
cult.51 There is otherwise nothing to report about the founding of Alba or indeed
about Ascanius’ reign as a whole.
The Albam dynasty of the Silvii
Even if Ascanius was the founder of Alba Longa, he was not the founder of its ruling
dynasty since the throne passed to his half-brother SILVIUS after his death.52 Such
an account may have been preferred because Silvius was born to an Italian mother,
and the Alban kings and latterly Romulus could be regarded as being equally of
Latin and Trojan origin if he had been the founder of the line. It was explained
that he succeeded to the throne because Ascanius had no children of his own; or
else Ascanius did have a son called Iulus (or Iulius) who tried to claim the throne
after his death, but the Albans elected Silvius instead, preferring to appoint Iulus
to priestly authority.53
From the time of Silvius onwards, the throne passed peacefully from father to son
until Numitor, the grandfather of Romulus, was forcibly excluded by his younger
— Aeneas, Romulus and the origins of Rome —
594

brother, and the sequence of events that would lead to the founding of Rome was
thus set in train. For reasons already indicated, most antiquarians came to believe
that more than four centuries must have elapsed between the arrival of Aeneas and
the founding of Rome, and a long line of Alban kings was therefore fabricated to
ﬁll the gap. Although the surviving catalogues differ from one another to some
extent, all agree that Romulus was separated from Aeneas by some ﬁfteen genera-
tions. Nothing is known for certain about the source of the original king-list, but
it is reasonable to assume that it was compiled around the third century BC rather
than much earlier or later. In Livy’s account, the following kings are said to have
ruled after Silvius: Aeneas Silvius, Latinus Silvius, Alba, Atys, Capys, Capetus,
Tiberinus, Agrippa, Romulus Silvius, Aventinus, and Proca, the father of Numitor.54
Such a list could hardly be anything other than highly artiﬁcial, and it will be
apparent at ﬁrst sight that most of these names were either recycled from elsewhere
in the tradition, as in the case of the ﬁrst two, or else invented as eponyms of
suitable places or geographical features, as in the case of Alba and Tiberinus.
The other main lists are provided by Diodorus (7.5.10–11), Ovid (Metamorphoses 14.610–21,
Fasti 42–52) and Dionysius of Halicarnassus (1.71.3). Aeneas Silvius, Latinus Silvius
and Romulus Silvius are shadows of their more famous namesakes. It is reported that
Romulus Silvius provoked the anger of Jupiter by imitating his thunder and lightning, 
and was struck dead by a thunderbolt;55 but this is simply a reworking of the Greek myth of
Salmoneus (see p. 422). His house was supposed to have been submerged below the Alban
Lake, where its remains could be seen in historical times. The names of Atys and Capys were
also recycled from the earlier tradition. Atys shares his name (which is related to that of the
Phrygian god Attis) with several members of the early Lydian royal family mentioned by
Herodotus.56 The Epitus who takes the place of Atys in some lists has a name of Homeric
origin, derived from a passage in the Iliad which states that a certain Epytos was the herald
of Aineias’ father.57 The name of Capys is based on that of Kapys, son of Assarakos, the grand-
father of Aineias, who is also mention in the Iliad.58 In an Italian context, his name is sugges-
tive of Capua; the Aeneid states accordingly that it was founded by a Capys who accompanied
Aeneas from Troy, while another account suggests that it was founded by Rhomos who named
it after Aeneas’ grandfather.59 It is harder to say why Capys’ successor should have been called
Capetus; the only Kapetos recorded in Greek mythology is thoroughly obscure, appearing in
a list of the suitors of Hippodameia who were killed by her father Oinomaos.60 Agrippa
would have been classed as an Alban king long before the time of Augustus’ famous minister
M. Vipsanius Agrippa; his name was presumably suggested by that of a legendary ﬁgure 
from the earlier history of Rome, Menenius Agrippa, who was supposed to have played a
prominent part in the events that led to the appointment of the ﬁrst tribune of the plebeians.61
Alba was obviously named after the city while Tiberinus was invented to serve as the eponym
of the Tiber; a facile story explains that the river was known as the Albula until it was
renamed in honour of Tiberinus after he was drowned while leading an army across it (or was
swept away by it after being killed in battle beside it).62 Aventinus was the eponym of the
Aventine hill at Rome. As the father of Numitor and Amulius, Proca would presumably have
appeared in the Roman foundation-myth before the invention of the dynasty of the Silvii. His
name, which can be related to the Latin word procer, means chieftain or prince.

The birth, exposure and earlier life of Romulus and Remus
PROCA, king of Alba, who reigned some twelve generations after the city was
founded by Ascanius, had two sons of contrasting nature, the noble-minded
NUMITOR and the vicious AMULIUS. Although Numitor should have succeeded
to the throne as the elder brother, Amulius drove him out and then murdered his
sons to reinforce his position.63 He also seized the daughter of Numitor, who was
known either as RHEA SILVIA or as ILIA, and forced her to become a Vestal Virgin,
ostensibly as an honour but in reality to prevent her from marrying and bearing chil-
dren who might present a danger to him. His precautions proved ineffective,
however, in the face of divine intervention. It was a duty of the priestesses of Vesta,
at Alba as at Rome, to fetch pure spring-water for use in the cult of the goddess; and
while the daughter of Numitor was visiting the grove of Mars (the god of war) for
this purpose one day, the god caught her by surprise and raped her, causing her to
conceive twin sons, ROMULUS and REMUS.64 Her uncle responded to this unwel-
come development with his customary ruthlessness, ordering that she should be
imprisoned or killed after the birth of her children65 and that the new-born infants
should be hurled into the Tiber. His plans were destined to be foiled once again,
however, because the river happened to be in ﬂood at the time. In one version of the
story, the king’s servants set the children aﬂoat in a basket or other small vessel, but
the overbrimming waters cast them safely ashore under the Palatine hill at the site of
Rome.66 Or fearing to approach the raging waters, the men left the basket on the
ground near the river-bank, and it was subsequently washed away by the rising waters
and carried gently downstream to the site of Rome.67 Or the men simply deposited
the children at the edge of the ﬂood-waters at the site of Rome itself.68 By whatever
course of events, the twins ended up at a point on the river-bank that was marked by
an ancient tree, the Ruminalis ﬁg-tree (ﬁcus Ruminalis).
Having supposedly stood at the site since before the city’s foundation, the Ruminalis ﬁg-
tree could still be seen in the age of Augustus, although it was apparently in poor shape
by then. It was associated with a minor goddess called Rumina. According to the Roman
antiquarians, her name was derived from the word ruma or rumis, a Latin term for the female
breast, and she was a deity who presided over the suckling of children. If that is the case,
it is understandable that milk-offerings should have been made to her, and that her tree
should have been a ﬁg-tree, which could be connected with breast-feeding and fertility on
account of its milky sap. Although it has been questioned whether the tree originally had
anything to do with Rumina, and indeed whether the traditional explanation of her name
and nature is correct, we can assume that the tree was introduced into the legend of the
twins (who were supposed to have been suckled beneath it) because it was regarded as being
connected with suckling. Since the name of the tree bears some resemblance to that of
Romulus, some ancient authors, including Livy, claimed that it had been named after him,
having originally been known as the ﬁcus Romularis. There was another such tree at the
Comitium (assembly-place) adjoining the Forum.
A she-wolf heard the abandoned infants crying as it was coming down to the river
to drink, and suckled them until they were discovered and rescued by their own
kind.69 Wolves were specially associated with Mars, the father of the twins; and
some authors stressed this connection by adding that a woodpecker, the bird of
— Aeneas, Romulus and the origins of Rome —
596

Mars, tended them also by bringing them food in its beak.70 The fact that the
Ruminalis ﬁg-tree was located near the grotto of the Lupercal, which had a name
suggestive of wolves (lupi), may have inﬂuenced the development of this part of the
legend.
Although exposed infants are regularly suckled by animals in Greek legend, there is no
record in early legend of any hero being suckled by a she-wolf. According to a Hellenistic
tale ascribed to Nicander (second century BC), Miletos, the founder of the Ionian city of that
name, was tended by wolves at the will of his father Apollo after he was exposed by his
mother of Crete. Since the legend of Miletos followed other patterns in the previous tradi-
tion (see pp. 350–1), it seems altogether likely that this version involving the wolves was
invented by Nicander himself, perhaps with the Roman legend in mind.71 The only other
Greek tale of the kind is presented as a Greek parallel for the legend of Romulus and Remus
in the pseudo-Plutarchean Greek and Roman Parallel Stories. An Arcadian nymph called
Phylonome once bore twin sons to Ares (the Greek equivalent of Mars) and exposed them
in the river Erymanthos for fear of her father’s anger; but they were cast ashore safely on
the river-bank and suckled by a she-wolf until they were rescued by the shepherd Tyliphos,
who reared them as his own children under the names Lykastos and Parrhasios; and in due
time they established themselves as the rulers of Arcadia. Ascribed to an evidently ﬁctitious
author, Zopyros of Byzantium, this is not really a parallel at all, but an apocryphal myth
that was fabricated by the author on the basis of the Roman story.72
The twins were eventually discovered by FAUSTULUS, the chief herdsman of
Amulius, who took them home and entrusted them to the care of his wife ACCA
LARENTIA. Or else some local shepherds stumbled across them and passed them
on to Faustulus.73 The name of the charitable Faustulus is derived from the Latin
word faustus, meaning lucky or auspicious; he was a bringer of good fortune. The
twins were reared by him and his wife in rural isolation, and supported themselves
by their own labours when they grew up, working with the local herdsmen and
building huts for themselves as shelter. A thatched hut that was supposedly of their
construction, the casa Romuli or ‘hut of Romulus’, could be seen on the Palatine hill
in historical times near the steps of Cacus; and there was another hut of the kind
on the Capitoline hill.74 As beﬁtted youths of royal descent, the twins showed them-
selves to be more enterprising than their fellow herdsmen, and became their
acknowledged leaders; it was said that they helped them to ﬁght back against cattle-
rustlers, or acted rather in the manner of Robin Hood, plundering from the local
brigands and sharing the proceeds with their rustic friends. One may suspect that
they would have engaged in cattle-rustling on their own account in the earliest
tradition.75
The twins ﬁnally discovered their true identity after Remus happened to be deliv-
ered into the hands of their exiled grandfather Numitor. They and their friends
lived on the Palatine hill, while the herdsmen of Numitor pastured their cattle on
the neighbouring Aventine; and the two different groups were constantly quarrelling
over grazing-rights and other matters. One day, after the feud had turned violent,
the herdsmen of Numitor captured Remus in an ambush while his brother 
and friends were attending a sacriﬁce (or taking part in the disorderly festival of
the Lupercalia), and hauled him in front of their master on a charge of cattle-theft.

Or else they took him to Amulius, who handed him over to his brother for judge-
ment. On hearing of Remus’ plight, Faustulus told Romulus all that he knew or
had guessed about the origin of the two brothers and their royal birth; and forti-
ﬁed by this knowledge, Romulus hurried off to Numitor to intercede on his brother’s
behalf. Numitor had already inferred from Remus’ noble appearance and conduct
that he might be something more than an ordinary herdsman, and had therefore
been making enquiries of his own. So when Romulus arrived, he ordered the release
of Remus (if he had not already done so) and acknowledged the young men as his
grandsons. The three of them then conspired together to avenge the wrongs that
had been inﬂicted on them by Amulius. With the help of their rustic friends, who
stole into Alba by separate routes beforehand, Romulus and Remus caught Amulius
by surprise in the palace and killed him; and Numitor summoned a meeting of the
citizens to reveal the crimes of the usurper and reclaim his rightful throne. Different
accounts of the story vary considerably in their details; Livy offers a version, for
instance, in which Remus was delivered to Numitor under false charges by some
local brigands who had been robbed by him and his brother; and the recognition-
scene in which Numitor becomes acquainted with his grandchildren was sometimes
greatly elaborated under the inﬂuence of comparable scenes from Greek tragedy. But
the general pattern is always much the same.76
The twins set off to found Rome; the contest of the auguries, 
and the death of Remus
Instead of remaining in Alba under their grandfather’s rule, Romulus and Remus
decided to found a city of their own by the Tiber in the area where they had been
washed ashore and had passed their happy earlier years. Numitor approved of their
plan (or even suggested it in one account) and assigned followers and land to them
for their new colony.77 The twins soon quarrelled, however, either about the site of
the city since Romulus wanted to establish it on the Palatine while Remus favoured
the Aventine, or else about the throne since each of them wanted to become 
its ruler and give his name to it, as Rome or Remora. They agreed to refer their
dispute to the arbitration of the gods by seeking an omen from bird-ﬂights, a
favourite form of divination in ancient Italy. So Romulus took the Palatine hill 
as his viewing-station while Remus went off to the Aventine a short way to the
south. Although it was commonly agreed that Romulus claimed victory after
observing a ﬂight of twelve vultures (one of the most important augural birds), the
course of the story varies in its different versions. In the earliest surviving account
from some lines of verse quoted from Ennius, Remus apparently saw no birds at all
(even if the passage breaks off too early for this to be entirely certain).78 In other
accounts, Remus saw six vultures before Romulus saw his twelve, and the signiﬁ-
cance of the omens was thus more disputable since they could be interpreted as
favouring Romulus on grounds of number or Remus on grounds of priority.
According to Livy, a ﬁght broke out between the supporters of each brother and
Remus was killed in the fray.79 It was more generally believed, however, that
Romulus was adjudged the victor and Remus met his death slightly later in other
circumstances.
— Aeneas, Romulus and the origins of Rome —
598

To mark out the bounds (pomerium) of the new city, Romulus yoked a bull and
cow together and ploughed a furrow around the base of the Palatine hill; and after
sacriﬁcing the plough-cattle and other victims, he set his followers to work to raise
a defensive wall along the line of the furrow and to build the city itself. While the
wall was in the course of construction, Remus, who was still aggrieved at having
been defeated in the contest over the auguries, mocked his brother by jumping 
over the half-completed ramparts and so committing a deliberately inauspicious 
act. Or else he did so with a more positive intent, to show the inadequacy of the
fortiﬁcations. Romulus was furious in any case and killed him in a ﬁt of anger,
cursing anyone who should dare to cross over the walls in the future to suffer a
comparable fate.80
There are two surviving myths from the Greek tradition that bear some resemblance to the
Roman story. An obscure Boeotian ruler called Poimandros, who was the eponymous founder
of Poimandria (near Tanagra or perhaps to be identiﬁed with it), was said to have killed his
son Ephippos for jumping over a defensive ditch that he had set around his city.81 Or in 
a somewhat different version, he killed his son (here named as Leukippos) with a stone by
accident when aiming at a builder who had disparaged the ditch and jumped over it.82 In the
other story of the kind, of which the barest outline is preserved, Oineus was said to have killed
his son Toxeus for ‘jumping over the ditch’ at his city of Calydon (see p. 413).83 These legends
– or the ﬁrst at least since so little is known of the second – seem to carry the same moral as
that of Remus, namely that anyone who violates the defensive circle commits an ill-omened
act that deserves drastic punishment, irrespective of ties of kinship. Anyone who crossed 
over the Roman walls in historical times was in fact liable to a death penalty. It should also
be remembered in this connection that the Romans and Etruscans (unlike the Greeks)
regarded city-walls as sacred. There is no reason to suppose that the legend of the death of
Remus was modelled on stories from Greece; it was known to Ennius and was probably a
central feature of the foundation legend from early times. Romulus’ act of fratricide, justiﬁed
though it may have been from a certain point of view, evidently came to be felt as something
of an embarrassment, since many accounts stress that he felt grave remorse afterwards or even
absolved him from the murder altogether. In Ovid’s version in the Fasti, for instance, a certain
Celer who took the lead during the building work was charged by Romulus to kill anyone
who dared to jump over the walls; and when Remus, who had not heard of his brother’s order,
cast scorn on them and jumped over them to prove their inadequacy, Celer struck him dead
with a shovel.84
How Romulus acquired people for his new city; his conﬂict 
with the Sabines, and death and apotheosis
Being now the sole and undisputed sovereign of the little community, Romulus set
out to procure more citizens by opening a sanctuary or asylum (from Greek asylon
– the name and institution alike are Greek, with no close equivalent in Italy) on
the Capitoline hill, in the dip between its two summits; and landless men and
outcasts, and runaway slaves and criminals, duly ﬂocked to it from the lands all
around.85 The future of the city was not yet assured, however, since women were
also required but the neighbouring peoples rejected all proposals of intermarriage,
partly because they feared that Rome might grow too powerful, and partly because
of the dubious origins of many of its citizens. So Romulus resorted to trickery.

He invited men from the surrounding territories, particularly the Sabines, to attend
the Roman festival of the Consualia with their wives and children, announcing 
that there would be splendid sacriﬁces and public games and shows; and in response
to a prearranged signal, the young men of Rome rushed into the crowd during 
the festivities and carried off all the unmarried girls. The episode has come to be
known as the rape (i.e. abduction) of the Sabine women. After the other visitors
had ﬂed, Romulus tried to reassure the captives, promising them that they would
be treated with proper respect if they were married to Roman citizens; and they
eventually became reconciled to their lot. Some authors agree with Livy in stating
that thirty girls were seized, while others suggest that there were many more, over
ﬁve hundred.86
Even if the abducted maidens came to accept their fate, their relations were less
philosophical and roused their cities to war. Although the smaller states were easily
defeated, the Sabines, under their king TITUS TATIUS, presented more of a threat.
They marched against Rome and seized the Capitol as a result of the treachery of
TARPEIA, the daughter of the citadel’s commander, who opened the gates to them
in secret because she coveted their gold armbands. In return for her help, they had
promised to give her ‘what they were wearing on their left arms’; but they fulﬁlled
their promise in a wholly different manner from what she had been expecting, by
crushing her to death under their shields (for they also carried those on their left
arms).87 As in similar Greek stories of ﬁlial treachery (see pp. 247 and 340), the
Sabines were so shocked by Tarpeia’s behaviour (even though they had beneﬁted
from it) that they preferred to kill her rather than to reward her for it. After this
initial success, the Sabines were able to use the Capitol as a base to attack the main
Roman force on the Palatine. The opposing armies clashed on low ground between
the two hills, on the site of the Forum, then a marshy and undrained strip of land.
A hard-fought battle ensued in which the Romans ﬁnally began to win the upper
hand; but as the two armies were preparing for the ﬁnal confrontation, the abducted
women, many of them mothers by this time and carrying their infants in their arms,
rushed in between the Romans and Sabines and appealed to them to make peace,
protesting that they would rather die than lose their husbands on the one hand or
their fathers on the other. This appeal had the desired effect, and the two leaders
stepped forward to make terms. They not only agreed to a truce but also resolved
that their two peoples should be united into a single nation under their joint rule.
Romulus remained on the Palatine with the original settlers while Titus Tatius and
his Sabines settled on the Capitol and Quirinal.88 This completes the cycle of legend
that began with Romulus’ establishment of the asylum; as a consequence of the war,
Rome acquired further citizens, and the arrival of the Sabines serves to account for
a strong Sabine element in the population. The ensuing period of dual kingship in
which Titus Tatius was supposed to have ruled alongside Romulus could serve as
a precedent for the dual consulship of the republican era.
This shadowy colleague of Romulus, who never found his way into the canonic list of the
Roman kings, was probably a ﬁgure of relatively late invention. He was said to have given
his name to one of the three early Roman tribes, the Titii or Titienses, and to have founded
— Aeneas, Romulus and the origins of Rome —
600

one of the minor priestly colleges at Rome, the Sodales Titii, whose function is unknown.
Before many years had passed, he provoked his own death through an act of injustice, leaving
Romulus to rule on his own once again. For when some ambassadors from Lavinium were
once subjected to an assault at Rome, and their fellow townsmen demanded compensation,
Titus Tatius refused to pay it because the men who had perpetrated the violence were rela-
tions of his; and when he subsequently visited Lavinium to perform an annual sacriﬁce (see
p. 592), the townsmen rioted and murdered him.89
Putting aside a mass of other material, pseudo-historical and aetiological, we may
conclude with the story of Romulus’ death. As he was reviewing his troops one day
on the Campus Martius (Field of Mars) just outside the city, a violent thunderstorm
broke out and he was enveloped in a cloud so thick that he was completely hidden
from view; and when the storm cleared, he was nowhere to be seen, and no trace
of him could ever be found. As the Romans were arguing about the meaning of
this mysterious event, a certain Julius Proculus, a farmer of Alba Longa, came to
the Forum to report that the gloriﬁed Romulus had appeared to him and had told
him that he had become the god Quirinus, and that Rome was destined to become
the capital of the world.90 After having once been one of the highest gods at Rome,
as is indicated by the fact that his ﬂamen (special priest) ranked with those of Iuppiter
and Mars as one of the ﬂamines maiores, Quirinus seems to have suffered something
of an eclipse; Romulus was presumably identiﬁed with him because he was a god
with martial associations who was thought to bear some resemblance to Mars (what-
ever his original nature). If the historians were happy to allow the exact nature of
Romulus’ departure to remain a mystery, a poet such as Ovid could describe how
his father Mars had descended from heaven in his blood-stained chariot to sweep
him away to his new home among the gods.91 Since this story of the founder’s
apotheosis was clearly Greek-inspired, and there is no evidence of an early cult of
Romulus at Rome, it is doubtless a relatively late feature of the foundation legend,
originating in the second or third century BC.
Rationalistic accounts are also recorded in which Romulus is said to have been secretly assas-
sinated. In one such version, the patricians conspired against him because they considered that
he was no longer ruling like a king but was exercising his power in an arbitrary and tyran-
nical fashion. So they joined together to murder him in the Senate-house, and then cut his
body into small pieces and carried them away under their clothing to bury them in secret.92
The earliest evidence for such a story is provided by an anecdote from Plutarch which would
suggest that it was familiar by 67 BC; for during the controversy over the Lex Gabinia of that
year, which granted exceptional powers to Pompey, one of the consuls is supposed to have
cried out that Pompey would meet with the same fate as Romulus if he set out to imitate
him.93 In another story of the same kind, some newly enrolled citizens who had a grievance
against Romulus took advantage of the above-mentioned storm on the Campus Martius to do
away with him while he was hidden from view.94
An important matter that remains to be considered is the question of the origin of
the legend of Romulus and Remus. Was this a genuine product of the Roman imag-
ination, perhaps even originating in folklore? And is it possible to draw any
conclusion about its time of origin? The tale of exposure and wondrous deliverance

of the twins certainly follows a pattern that is very familiar in Greek myth, in which
a hero is conceived to a god by an unmarried girl who is isolated from ordinary
family life in some way, and is exposed at birth but saved by the attentions of an
animal, which suckles the child until he is discovered by a shepherd or herdsman;
the countryman then rears him in pastoral seclusion until he emerges to fulﬁl some
exceptional destiny. Twins ﬁgure, moreover, in some Greek myths of this kind, such
as that of Pelias and Neleus (see p. 380). If the story of the exposure and rescue of
Romulus and Remus was not of native origin, it would surely have been no difﬁ-
cult matter for some Greek or Roman author to invent it through imitation of
famous Greek stories such as these; and precisely because the parallels are so striking,
and for a variety of other reasons too, most classical scholars were once inclined to
believe that it was a literary fabrication of relatively late origin. Tales of the expo-
sure and rescue of royal children, however, are by no means conﬁned to Greek myth,
but accord with a widespread pattern which is attested in the traditions of other
Indo-European peoples and far beyond. So there is nothing inherently implausible
in the notion that the Romulus-legend may have been developed at Rome inde-
pendently of Greek inﬂuence, perhaps even as a folk-tale. Partly as the result of the
admission of a wider range of comparative evidence, but above all as the result of
a reassessment of relevant aspects of the Greek and Roman tradition, there has been
a marked shift in the consensus in recent decades, and most authorities are now
inclined to accept that the legend of Romulus and Remus was a fairly ancient story
of indigenous origin.
Although there is no positive evidence to show exactly when the legend of the
exposure of Romulus and Remus was ﬁrst developed, we can at least be sure that
it was familiar at Rome by the end of the fourth century BC. Livy reports that two
Roman magistrates (curule aediles), Cnaeus Ogulnius and Quintus Ogulnius, raised
a statue of the wolf and twins near the Ruminalis ﬁg-tree in 296 BC, paying for it
with ﬁnes that they had collected from usurers;95 and some thirty years later, prob-
ably in 266 BC, this group of the wolf and twins was shown on the earliest silver
coinage minted at Rome. This would suggest that the story was not only well-
established by this period, but had acquired an accepted status at Rome as the stan-
dard foundation-legend. Since the minor historian Callias, who worked at the court
of Agathocles of Syracuse (died 289 BC), is the earliest datable Greek author known
to have referred to Romulus in connection with the founding of Rome,96 the evidence
from Greek literature takes us no further back. If it is indeed the case that the
legend of Romulus and Remus was of native invention, it is reasonable to assume
nonetheless that the basic story was quite old, perhaps dating back to the early sixth
century BC.

he forthcoming references are intended above all to indicate the main ancient
sources for mythical narratives and mythological information in the preceding
text; references to secondary sources have been kept to a minimum. Except in the
case of myths that are recorded in very few accounts or only a single account, the
references to ancient accounts of mythical narratives are not exhaustive; although
more sources, especially from the Latin literature, could often have been cited, it
can be more confusing than helpful to pile up references to obscure, repetitive or
misleading accounts from the later record. Special attention is paid to the pre-
Hellenistic tradition, and a special effort has been made to include accounts that
are easily accessible in English translation (even if this is not possible in every case).
For readers who wish to seek more detailed information on early sources, Timothy
Gantz’s Early Greek Myth (see the Bibliographical Note) can be recommended; and
in the footnotes to his Loeb edition of Apollodorus’ Library (Harvard, ﬁrst published
in 1921), Sir James Frazer provides useful lists of references to sources of every
period for most important myths.
Conventional abbreviations are generally used for authors and their works. For
Greek authors, these usually accord with those listed at the front of the Greek lexicon
of Liddell and Scott; but longer forms have sometimes been used to make them
more immediately intelligible to the general reader, and the names of works of liter-
ature are sometimes cited in English translation for the same reason. Some of the

THE RISE OF ZEUS AND REVOLTS AGAINST HIS RULE
1
Aphrodite can only be regarded as one of the younger Olympian deities if she was the
daughter of Zeus and Dione; if she was born from the sea-foam that surrounded the sev-
ered genitals of Ouranos, as in Hesiod’s account (see p. 67), she was born at an earlier
period than any other Olympian deity (not that it makes any practical difference).

91
Although Apollodorus’ language is somewhat ambiguous, we should surely understand
that Polydektes refuses to take the contribution from Perseus, rather than that he fails
to get it; this is made absolutely clear by Pherecydes, who was probably Apollodorus’
source at this point. Pherecydes also indicates that each guest was expected to
contribute a single horse; Apollodorus’ reference to ‘horses’ in connection with Perseus
is probably an error.

This can be no more than a theory, however, since there is no surviving record of a
people of that name. 
126

as is agreed in subsequent sources from Hes. fr. 183 onwards; on Broteas, see n.132.

BIBLIOGRAPHICAL 
NOTE

T
hree good dictionaries of classical mythology are currently available in English.
The oldest is that of Pierre Grimal, which was ﬁrst published in Paris in 1951;
it has been issued in two English editions, as The Dictionary of Classical Mythology
(Blackwell, Oxford, 1986, a full translation with references to ancient sources) and
as The Penguin Dictionary of Classical Mythology (1991, abridged with some alter-
ations, without references). It is useful and generally reliable, if perhaps somewhat
dull. An edition of Edward Tripp’s Meridian Handbook of Classical Mythology has
recently been published in Britain as Collins Dictionary of Classical Mythology (2002).
It concentrates for the most part on myths from the more accessible sources and
main ancient anthologies, but is broader in its range of reference than the other two
dictionaries in some other respects, for it includes entries on peoples, places and
authors. Readers who have no special knowledge of the ancient world may ﬁnd it
particularly helpful for that reason. Jenny March’s Cassell Dictionary of Classical
Mythology (London, 1998) is scholarly and accessible, a model of its kind; it is both
enjoyable to dip into and useful as work of reference. Various other dictionaries have
been published. William Smith’s Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography (3 vols,
London, 1844) is an old war-horse that deserves an honourable mention; and Richard
Stoneman’s little dictionary, Greek Mythology (London, 1991) departs from the
common pattern by including entries on post-classical legend and folklore. We must
next turn to two authors who have produced well-known surveys of Greek myth in
two volumes. Carl Kerényi’s Gods of the Greeks (London, 1951) and Heroes of the Greek
(London, 1974) are works of strong individual character founded on an exhaustive
knowledge of the ancient sources. Robert Graves’s Penguin guide, The Greek Myths
(ﬁrst published in 1955), makes attractive reading and conveys much solid infor-
mation, but should be approached with extreme caution nonetheless. Although
Graves was certainly well acquainted with the relevant ancient sources, he tended
to run together material of diverse origin and value when constructing his summaries
of the various bodies of myth, and the resulting narratives are by no means free of
eccentric errors and arbitrary fancies. As for the explanatory notes, they are either
the greatest single contribution that has ever been made to the interpretation of
Greek myth or else a farrago of cranky nonsense; I fear that it would be impossible
to ﬁnd any classical scholar who would agree with the former diagnosis.

To proceed to works of a more academic character, Timothy Gantz’s Early Greek
Myth: A Guide to the Literary and Artistic Sources (Baltimore and London, one volume
in cloth, 1993, two volumes in paperback, 1996) can be recommended unreservedly
as a comprehensive guide to the early mythical tradition; anyone who wants to trace
the early development of Greek myths in the original sources will ﬁnd it invalu-
able. Although it concentrates on archaic myth in particular, as the title would
suggest, it takes due account of the standard later tradition as reported by authors
such as Apollodorus and Hyginus; the artistic record is primarily referred to in so
far as it provides the earliest evidence for myths or for speciﬁc variants or motifs.
Full and detailed information on the ancient artistic representations of myths and
ﬁgures from myth can be found in the magniﬁcent volumes of the Lexicon
Iconographicum Mythologiae Classicae (1981 onward). The various publications of Karl
Schefold (some of which have been translated into English, see below) can also be
very helpful in this regard. The other main reference works on Greek myth are
German works of long standing. An exhaustive analysis of the entire corpus of Greek
heroic mythology is provided by Carl Robert in Die griechische Heldensage (3 vols,
Berlin, 1920–6; = Griechische Mythologie 2, and originally undertaken as a revision
of the work of that title by Ludwig Preller). Alas, it has no index. The most compre-
hensive articles on individual ﬁgures from Greek mythology are to be found in two
German encyclopaedias, Roscher’s Lexicon, which is devoted exclusively to classical
mythology, and the great Realencyclopädie, which is a general encyclopaedia of clas-
sical civilization. The former (W.H. Roscher (ed.), Ausführliches Lexikon der griechischen
und römischen Mythologie) was published in six volumes with four supplements at
Leipzig from 1884 to 1937. The articles tended to get longer and more detailed as
the work progressed. Although the interpretations (especially in the earlier volumes)
often appeal to outdated theories of nature-symbolism, the articles provide very
useful and often very thorough surveys of the mythological traditions associated with
major and minor ﬁgures from classical myth and legend. The corresponding arti-
cles in the eighty volumes of ‘Pauly–Wissowa’ (Paulys Realencyclopädie der classischen
Altertumswissenschaft, Stuttgart, 1894–1963) naturally show some variation in their
comprehensiveness and quality, but this is generally one of the richest resources
available to the mythologist. The abridged version, Der Kleine Pauly, edited in ﬁve
volumes by W. Sontheimer and K. Ziegler (Stuttgart, 1964), can also be very helpful,
especially in hunting references.
There is no end to the number of books that have been written on Greek myth-
ology. As two introductory work of rather different kinds, I would recommend Fritz
Graf, Greek Mythology: An Introduction (Baltimore, 1993) and G.S. Kirk The Nature
of Greek Myth (Penguin, Harmondsworth, 1974). I have otherwise picked out a small
selection of books in the hope of providing proﬁtable suggestions for further reading,
especially to those who have no special knowledge of the ﬁeld.

INDEXES

The names of characters from Greek myth are almost always given in their original Greek
form. Although the Latinized forms may be more familiar to many readers, no confusion need
arise if the following distinctions are kept in mind:
• The Greek consonant kappa (representing a k or hard c) is transliterated as a k rather than
as a c as in Latin usage. ‘Kyklopes’ and ‘Kanake’ will thus be found rather than ‘Cyclopes’
and ‘Canace’.
• The Greek diphthongs ai and oi (pronounced as in ‘aisle’ and ‘coin’) are not transliterated
into ae and oe as in Latin usage. ‘Aithra’ and ‘Oineus’ will thus be found rather than ‘Aethra’
and ‘Oeneus’. 
• The Greek diphthongs – or strictly speaking, digraphs – ei and ou (pronounced roughly as
in ‘feint’ and ‘boule’ in classical Attic) are not transliterated into long i and u as in Latin
usage. ‘Teiresias’ will thus be found rather than ‘Tiresias’, and ‘Boutes’ rather than ‘Butes’. 
• The ﬁnal –os often found in men’s names, e.g. Kadmos and Anios, is not represented as –us
as in Latin usage.
For everyday purposes and in ordinary conversation, it is neither customary nor desirable
for English speakers to attempt to pronounce Greek names exactly as they would have been
pronounced in classical Athens. If a semi-Anglicized pronunciation is adopted, Greek names
can easily be pronounced without grave distortion if a few basic rules are observed.
Consonants: The Greek consonant chi is transliterated as ch; it represents an aspirated 
k (much as can be heard in the English word ‘cat’ when it is emphatically enunciated). In
Greek names, it may be pronounced as a k, as when we speak of Achilles. It should certainly
not be pronounced as in ‘chess’. The Greek g (gamma) is properly a hard g as in ‘game’. 
Vowels: There are no mute vowels in Greek words. In particular, a ﬁnal -e and the e in
ﬁnal –es should always be sounded as a long e, as when we speak of Aphrodite and Socrates.
In Greek, ae, oe and oo (as found, for instance, in the names of Pasiphae, Kallirhoe and
Acheloos) are never diphthongs, and each vowel should be sounded separately. In names, ai
will usually be a diphthong; as such (e.g. in the names of Aigyptos and Andraimon), it may
be pronounced as in ‘high’. The diphthong eu may be pronounced as in ‘euphony’, and au
as in ‘how’; the pronunciations of other diphthongs are indicated just above in the notes on
Greek and Latin forms.
