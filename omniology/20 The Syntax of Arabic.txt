The Syntax of Arabic
Recent research on the syntax of Arabic has produced valuable literature on the
major syntactic phenomena found in the language. This guide to Arabic syntax
provides an overview of the major syntactic constructions in Arabic that have
featured in recent linguistic debates, and discusses the analyses provided for them
in the literature. A broad variety of topics is covered, including argument structure,
negation, tense, agreement phenomena, and resumption. The discussion of each
topic sums up the key research results and provides new points of departure
for further research. The book also contrasts Standard Arabic with other Arabic
varieties spoken in the Arab world. An engaging guide to Arabic syntax, this
book will be invaluable to graduate students interested in Arabic grammar, as
well as syntactic theorists and typologists.

Responding to the increasing interest in comparative syntax, the goal of the
Cambridge Syntax Guides is to make available to all linguists major ﬁndings,
both descriptive and theoretical, which have emerged from the study of particular
languages. The series is not committed to working in any particular framework,
but rather seeks to make language-speciﬁc research available to theoreticians and
practitioners of all persuasions.
Written by leading ﬁgures in the ﬁeld, these guides will each include an
overview of the grammatical structures of the language concerned. For the
descriptivist, the books will provide an accessible introduction to the methods
and results of the theoretical literature; for the theoretician, they will show how
constructions that have achieved theoretical notoriety ﬁt into the structure of
the language as a whole; for everyone, they will promote cross-theoretical and
cross-linguistic comparison with respect to a well-deﬁned body of data.

Issues in the syntax of Arabic
1.1
The Arabic language(s)
Arabic belongs to the Semitic branch of the Afro-Asiatic (Hamito-
Semitic) family of languages, which includes languages like Aramaic, Ethiopian,
South Arabian, Syriac, and Hebrew. A number of the languages in this group are
spoken in the Middle East, the Arabian Peninsula, and Africa. It has been docu-
mented that Arabic spread with the Islamic conquests from the Arabian Peninsula
and within a few decades, it spread over a wide territory across North Africa
and the Middle East. Arabic is now spoken by more than 200 million speakers
excluding bilingual speakers (Gordon 2005).
Although there is a debate about the history of Arabic (including that of the
Standard variety and the spoken dialects) Arabic displays some of the typical
characteristics of Semitic languages: root-pattern morphology, broken plurals in
nouns, emphatic and glottalized consonants, and a verbal system with preﬁx and
sufﬁx conjugation.
1.1.1
The development of Arabic
Classical Arabic evolved from the standardization of the language of
the Qur’an and poetry. This standardization became necessary at the time when
Arabic became the language of an empire, with the Islamic expansion starting in
the seventh century. In addition to Classical Arabic, there were regional spo-
ken Arabic varieties. It is a matter of intense debate what the nature of the
historical relation between Classical Arabic and the spoken dialects is (Owens
2007).
Modern Standard Arabic emerged in the nineteenth century at a time when
Arabic was gaining the status of ofﬁcial language in the Arab world, and coinciding
with the emergence of Arab nationalism (see Suleiman (2003) and references
therein). The process of modernization of the language started in the early twentieth
century with Arab academies playing a crucial role in “preserving” the Arabic
1

2
Issues in the Syntax of Arabic
language from dialectal and foreign inﬂuence, and adapting it to the needs of
modern times. Unsurprisingly, in spite of the unifying work of those academies,
one can still observe regional variations in Modern Standard Arabic.
1.1.2
The Modern Arabic dialects and Modern Standard Arabic
The linguistic space of the Arabic-speaking world, which spans a large
geographical area from the Persian Gulf in Asia to the Atlantic Ocean in North West
Africa, is shared by several language varieties, which include Modern Standard
Arabic, and a number of Arabic vernaculars that remain mainly as spoken dialects.
Those dialects differ from one another, with mutual intelligibility decreasing
as the geographical distance between them increases. The main geographical
linguistic groupings are the Maghreb (mainly North Africa), Egypt, the Levant,
and the Gulf.1 Modern Standard Arabic and the spoken dialects of Arabic exist
in a diglossic situation (Ferguson 1959): the Arabic vernaculars are what people
acquire at home, and thus, they are the native languages of the people in the
Arab world. Modern Standard Arabic is the language for writing and for formal
speaking and is only acquired at school. Thus, not all speakers of Arabic have equal
command of the Standard dialect and their colloquial dialect. Language choice in
the Arab world is not only determined by the factors that inﬂuence the functional
distribution of the various Arabic varieties; it also has a political association, since
Modern Standard Arabic has become a symbol of the unity of the Arab world
(Suleiman 2003).
1.2
General characteristics of the syntax of Arabic
In this brief introduction to the sociology of Arabic we highlighted the
complex relationships that exist between Modern Standard Arabic and the various
Arabic vernaculars. This complexity can also be found in the variation observed
between the grammars of the different Arabic varieties. In this book, we focus
mainly on the description of grammatical structures in Standard Arabic, Moroccan
Arabic, and Lebanese Arabic. However, to illustrate the range of variation that
exists, we also use data from Egyptian Arabic, Palestinian Arabic, and the Gulf
varieties.
1 There are also Arabic-speaking minorities in Sub-Saharan Africa (particularly Cameroon,
Chad, and Nigeria) and Asia (Afghanistan, Turkey, and Uzbekistan) (see Versteegh 1997:
chapter 13).

1.2 General characteristics of the syntax of Arabic
3
In the sections that follow, we introduce the key empirical generalizations that
characterize the syntax of the various Arabic dialects under consideration, and
which we develop in the present book, taking into consideration previous work in
the area.2
1.2.1
The syntax of the A-domain
1.2.1.1
Clause structure
There are a number of issues that arise in the context of Arabic clauses.
The ﬁrst issue concerns the structure of the clause, particularly the categories, such
as tense and negation, that occupy the space between the complementizers and
the lexical predicates – the so-called A-domain. For example, it has traditionally
been claimed that Arabic verbs carry aspectual or temporal morphology which
is realized through verbal templates and agreement morphology. Thus, in the
present tense, the verb in Standard Arabic may display a speciﬁc vocalic melody
and discontinuous agreement (1a) while in the past tense it may display a different
vocalic melody and sufﬁxal agreement (1b).
(1)
a. ya-ktub-na
3-write-fp
‘They are writing.’
b. katab-na
wrote-3fp
‘They wrote.’
The question we ask is whether tense (or aspect) is realized through the vocalic
melodies or as part of the agreement morphology. To provide an adequate answer
to this problem we must go beyond Standard Arabic to see how the dialects
realize tense, and what role, if any, vocalic melodies play. The data that will be
presented and discussed in chapter 2 suggest that tense in Arabic may not be
realized through vocalic melodies or as part of the agreement morphology. This
in turn raises the question of whether there is an abstract tense element/projection
in the Arabic clause. Evidence from Case, temporal adverbs, and tensed negatives
provide syntactic support for such a projection.
A related question that arises in the context of simple clauses concerns the
structure of the so-called verbless sentences and whether they contain a null VP
constituent (2).
2 In this book we will deal only with the sentential syntax of Modern Standard Arabic and
other Arabic varieties. Thus, we do not include a discussion of the Construct State and
the syntax of DPs.

4

(2)
ʔal-kitaab-u
ˇzadiid-un
the-book-Nom new-Nom
‘The book is new.’
In (2) there is no verbal copula and no element carrying tense. It has been
debated in the literature whether a sentence such as (2) has the same structure
as ﬁnite sentences with verbal predicates or whether it is a small clause. Again
evidence based on Case – the Case assigned to adjectival and nominal predicates in
Standard Arabic – argues for a full clause structure, but without a VP projection.
This implies that a tense projection may not require the projection of a VP, a
conclusion that is not consistent with most analyses that suggest that the presence
of tense requires the presence of a verb (as its extended projection or feature
checker).
1.2.1.2
Subjects and subject positions
A second issue concerns the status of the subject in Arabic varieties.
Arabic subjects can occur in different positions: before the verb as in (3), and after
the verb as in (4). This variability has led to debates about the underlying and
surface positions of the subject and whether in some word order patterns (such as
SVO) the so-called subject can indeed be characterized as such.
(3)

‘Ahmed met Mona.’
Chapter 3 takes up the discussion of subject positions in various Arabic varieties
in detail. Contra proposals that have argued that the postverbal subject is in the
speciﬁer of the VP projection, we will discuss data that suggest that it is outside

1.2 General characteristics of the syntax of Arabic
5
the VP. With regard to the preverbal subject, we will review the arguments which
state that it behaves as a topic (see also chapter 8 of this book).
1.2.1.3
Agreement and agreement asymmetries
Standard Arabic is well known for its agreement asymmetries whereby
the subject partially agrees with the verb under the VS order (5a) but fully agrees
with it under the SV order (5b).
(5)
a. ʔakal-at l-muʕallimaat-u
ate-3fs
the-teacher.fp-Nom
‘The teachers ate.’
b. l-muʕallimaat-u
ʔakal-na
the-teacher.fp-Nom ate-3fp
‘The teachers ate.’
The third issue we take up is the analysis of the agreement phenomena in
Arabic. Various syntactic alternatives have been explored in the literature, but
are shown to have fallen short of accounting for the full range of data. We will
explore alternative ways of deriving the asymmetry from the interface of syntax
and morpho-phonology.
Another intriguing agreement asymmetry concerns ﬁrst conjunct agreement in
coordination structures whereby the verb agrees with the ﬁrst conjunct in the VS
order but must agree with the full conjunct in the SV order. Moreover, number
sensitive items seem to force full conjunct agreement in the VS order. The full
set of facts will be discussed, as well as possible analyses, including a biclausal
account for close conjunct agreement.
1.2.1.4
The syntax of sentential negation
The fourth issue we discuss within the Arabic simple clause is sentential
negation, which presents a complex problem in Arabic syntax. In Standard Arabic,
there are ﬁve main negative particles that realize sentential negation. Two of these
particles, lam and lan, also carry temporal information (6).
(6)
a. T-Tullaab-u
lam
ya-drus-uu
Standard Arabic
the-students-Nom Neg.past 3-study-mp
‘The students did not study.’
b. T-Tullab-u
lan
ya-drus-uu
the-students-Nom Neg.fut 3-study-mp
‘The students will not study.’
laa, by contrast, occurs only in imperatives and present tense sentences with
verbal predicates.

a. T-Tullab-u

ya-drus–uu-n
Standard Arabic
the-students-Nom Neg 3-study-mp-ind
‘The students do not study.’
b. laa
ta-drus
Neg 2-study
‘Do not study!’
Another negative particle, laysa, occurs only in present tense sentences, accom-
panying verbal predicates as well as non-verbal predicates. However, unlike the
other negatives, it carries agreement morphology.
(8)
laysat
ﬁi l-bayt-i
Neg.3fs in the-house-Gen
‘She is not in the house.’
The fact that negation can carry temporal information and agreement morphol-
ogy argues for its head status and also, possibly, for locating it between the tense
projection and the verbal projection.
On the other hand, in the spoken dialects, there are usually only two forms
of negation whose distribution is also restricted by the tense of the clause and
the category of the predicate. Though the spoken dialects and Standard Arabic
differ in their negative particle inventories, the underlying syntax turns out to be
similar in that the conditions that regulate the distribution of sentential negation
in Standard Arabic also regulate its distribution in the spoken dialects. The main
difference is that in Standard Arabic the negatives can carry temporal information
but they cannot do so in the spoken dialects.
Another important aspect of sentential negation concerns the dependencies
it enters into with negative polarity items and negative quantiﬁers. The NPI
¯hədd in Moroccan Arabic in (9) is restricted to the post-negative position. But
another NPI, ¯hətta+NP, can occur in both the pre-negative and post-negative
positions (10).
(9)
a. ma-ˇza
¯hədd
Neg-came.3ms one
‘No one came.’
b. *¯hədd ma-ˇza

(10)
a. ma-ˇza
¯hətta wa¯həd
Neg-came.3ms even one
‘No one came.’

1.2 General characteristics of the syntax of Arabic

b. ¯hətta wa¯həd ma-ˇza

Neg-came.3ms
‘No one came.’
Word order, and more intriguingly, the category type of the negative polarity items
are critical to the distribution of those elements.
1.2.2
The syntax of the A′-domain: unbounded dependencies in Arabic
The various Arabic varieties under consideration make use of several
strategies for forming unbounded dependencies between a sentence or clause
peripheral element and a sentence internal position. In parallel with the canonical
unbounded dependency between a peripheral element and a gap in a sentence
internal position, certain constructions exhibit a phenomenon called resumption,
where the sentence internal position to which the peripheral element is related
is occupied by an overtly realized anaphoric element, called a resumptive.3 Most
3 It is generally pronouns that serve as resumptive elements (see McCloskey 2002, 2005);
although, it has been observed that certain noun phrases, like epithets, can also occur as
resumptives, as illustrated in the Lebanese Arabic example in (i) (see McCloskey 1990;
Shlonsky 1992; Aoun and Choueiri 2000; Aoun, Choueiri, and Hornstein 2001):
(i)
¯hkii-na
maʕ l-bint
lli
ʔaal-o
ʔənno ha-l-mʕattara ¯ha-təSʔut
talked-1p with the-girl that said-3p that
this-the-poor
Fut.-fail.3fs
‘We spoke with the girl whom they said that this poor one will fail.’
In addition, there is variability among the Arabic dialects as to whether they allow
strong pronouns as resumptive elements. Whereas in Moroccan Arabic strong pronouns
are excluded from the contexts of resumption, Lebanese Arabic strong pronouns are not.
Ouhalla (2001) provides relevant examples from Moroccan Arabic to illustrate this point
((iia–b) correspond to Ouhalla’s (21a–b)).
(ii)
a. ˇsmen
Talib
nsiti
ﬁn
tlaqiti-h
(*huwwa)
which student forgot-2s where met-2s-him (HIM)
‘Which student have you forgotten where you met?’
b. ˇsmen
Talib
saferti
qblma yTerdu-h
(*huwwa)
which student traveled-2s before expelled-3p-him (HIM)
‘Which student did you travel before they expelled?’
The sentences in (ii) contrast with their equivalents in Lebanese Arabic, where the
sentence initial wh-phrase can bind the strong resumptive pronoun (iii).
(iii)
a. ʔayya tilmiiz
nsiit-e
ween
ltaʔay-te ﬁ-i
huwwe

seefar-te
ʔablma yiˇs¯haT-u
-u
huwwe
which student traveled-2fs before
expelled-3p him (HIM)
‘Which student did you travel before they expelled?’
In all Arabic dialects, weak pronouns can be used productively as resumptive elements,
and in this book we discuss only weak pronouns as resumptive elements.

8
Issues in the Syntax of Arabic
Arabic dialects make productive use of the resumptive strategy, in parallel with
the gap strategy.
One of the main questions that can be raised in that regard is: why do languages
make use of more than one strategy to construct unbounded dependencies? In
order to answer such a question, one needs to understand the properties of the
gap strategy and those of the resumptive strategy and how the gap strategy and
the resumptive strategy are related cross-linguistically and within a given Arabic
variety.
1.2.2.1
Wh-interrogatives
Wh-interrogatives display the richest repertoire of strategies in forming
unbounded dependencies. Thus, the various Arabic varieties make use of up to
four different strategies in forming wh-questions: the gap strategy, the resumptive
strategy, the Class II resumptive strategy, and the wh-in-situ strategy. Whereas in
the gap strategy the variable position corresponds to an empty position inside the
sentence, in both the resumptive strategy and the Class II resumptive strategy, it is
occupied by a pronominal element. The in situ strategy involves a wh-constituent
in the variable position inside the sentence.
Lebanese Arabic, for instance, makes use of all four strategies, as exempliﬁed
in (11):
(11)
a. ʔayya mmasil ˇsəft
Ø b-l-maTʕam?
Gap Strategy
which actor
saw.2ms
in-the-restaurant
‘Which actor did you see in the restaurant?’
b. ʔayya mmasil ˇsəft-o
b-l-maTʕam?
Resumptive Strategy
which actor
saw.2ms-him in-the-restaurant
‘Which actor did you see in the restaurant?’
c. miin (ya)lli ˇsəft-o
b-l-maTʕam?
Class II Resumptive
who that

Strategy
‘Who is it that you saw in the restaurant?’
d. ˇsəft
ʔayya mmasil b-l-maTʕam?
In-situ Strategy
saw.2ms which actor
in-the-restaurant
‘Which actor did you see in the restaurant?’
The wh-in-situ strategy is not available in Standard Arabic; the gap strategy
doesn’t seem to be available in Egyptian Arabic. However, each of the Arabic
varieties under consideration seems to make use of at least two different strategies
in forming its wh-interrogatives.

The different strategies impose different restrictions on (i) the type of wh-phrase
that can be involved, and (ii) the distribution of the “variable” position within the
sentence. The gap in wh-interrogatives can occur in simplex and complex sen-
tences, but it is prohibited inside islands. The pronoun, whether in resumptive
wh-interrogatives or Class II resumptive interrogatives, can occur in all con-
texts, including islands. Wh-in-situ elements can occur in simplex and complex
sentences.4
There has been much discussion on the relation between the availability of a
given strategy for forming wh-interrogatives and the nature of the wh-constituent
involved. Thus it has been argued that, whereas all wh-constituents may be related
to a gap in a wh-question, only a subset of those can be related to a pronominal in
a resumptive wh-question. In Lebanese Arabic, this is illustrated in Table 1.1.
We will argue that the notions of referentiality/d-linking, however under-
stood, are inadequate to characterize the set of wh-constituents which can form
unbounded dependencies with a pronominal element. This is further complicated
by the fact that within Lebanese Arabic, the same wh-constituent, namely ˇsu
‘what,’ is prohibited in resumptive wh-interrogatives, but not in Class II resump-
tive wh-interrogatives.
The nature of the wh-constituent which occurs in the in situ strategy varies across
the Arabic dialects. Whereas in Egyptian Arabic all wh-constituents may occur in
situ, in Lebanese Arabic only a subset of those can occur in situ. The subset of wh-
constituents which occur in situ in Lebanese Arabic does not coincide with that of
those which occur in resumptive wh-interrogatives. Thus, kam NP ‘how many NP,’
which cannot occur in a resumptive wh-question (12a), can occur in situ (12b).

In chapter 6, we will examine various analyses which attempt to characterize, in
general terms, the subset of wh-constituents which occur in situ, but will conclude
that none of them account for the facts across the various Arabic varieties.
1.2.2.2
Restrictive relatives
The resumptive strategy is the default strategy for forming restrictive rela-
tive clauses in the various Arabic dialects. The investigation of those constructions
in chapter 7 leads us to uncover further generalizations in the syntax of resump-
tion. First, we show that a difference needs to be made between deﬁnite relatives
and indeﬁnite relatives. Deﬁnite relatives always occur with the complementizer
allaði, the only complementizer available for relative clauses in Standard Arabic
(13a); indeﬁnite relatives on the other hand cannot occur with a complementizer
(13b).
(13)
a. Daaʕa
l-kitaabu *(allaði) ˇstaraytu-hu
l-baari¯hata
be-lost.3ms the-book that

‘The book that I bought yesterday is lost.’
b. ʔufattiˇsu ʕana kitaabin (*allaði) ʔaDaʕtu-hu l-yawma
look.1s
for
book
that
lost.1s-it
the-day
‘I am looking for a book that I lost today.’
When the gap strategy is available in forming relative clauses (e.g. in Standard
Arabic), it is only available for deﬁnite relatives and not for indeﬁnite relatives.
While non-referential NPs can be the antecedent in a deﬁnite relative, they cannot
head an indeﬁnite relative.
Second, a thorough investigation of the distribution of resumptive pronouns in
deﬁnite relatives shows that, unlike what is generally argued for Arabic, resumption
is selectively sensitive to islands. Thus, a resumptive pronoun related to a non-
referential NP cannot occur inside an island, as illustrated in the Lebanese Arabic
sentences in (14).

This selective sensitivity to islands shows that resumption cannot be said to be
a unitary phenomenon within a given Arabic variety.
1.2.2.3
The syntax of the left periphery
The examination of focus fronting constructions, which use the gap strat-
egy in forming unbounded dependencies, and clitic-left dislocation constructions,
which make use of resumption in their unbounded dependencies, further conﬁrms
two generalizations:
(15)
a. Gap constructions do not impose restrictions on the nature of their
antecedents.
b. The set of possible antecedents of a resumptive pronominal is not
constrained by referentiality/d-linking.
While chapter 8 examines further differences between the syntax of focus
fronting and clitic-left dislocation, chapter 9 focuses on the interaction between
the gap strategy and the resumptive strategy, as exempliﬁed in sentences which
involve both focus fronting and clitic-left dislocation. We observe that whereas
in a given sentence there can be multiple clitic-left dislocated elements, there can
be only one (fronted) focused constituent. Another important observation is that,
while some Arabic varieties impose an ordering requirement on focused elements
and clitic-left dislocated elements, other varieties don’t.
We will conclude that clitic-left dislocated noun phrases need to be distinguished
from preverbal subjects, as well as broad subjects (Doron and Heycock 1999; and
Alexopoulou, Doron, and Heycock 2004). In light of all these generalizations we
argue that the “Split CP” hypothesis (Rizzi 1997) provides a plausible account for
the syntax of the left periphery in Arabic.

Clause structure in Arabic
2.1
Introduction
One of the distinguishing features of the Principles and Parameters frame-
work is the fundamental assumption that syntactic conﬁgurations expressing hier-
archical relations between heads and their surrounding constituents are key to
capturing generalizations involving Case assignment, agreement relations, argu-
ment selection, polarity licensing, restrictions on displacement, and perhaps word
order and other properties. However, there is no consensus as to how to account for
the variation that clauses display cross-linguistically or even within the same lan-
guage. Under some approaches, languages differ as to whether a particular element
heads a syntactic projection in the syntax. This issue has been extensively debated
in the context of categories such as agreement (Pollock 1989; Ouhalla 1991; Ben-
mamoun 1992a; Iatridou 1990; Chomsky 1995; Cinque 1999). The same question
arises in the context of tense and VP. For example, in some languages there is
neither an overt tense marker nor a copula in the present tense, leading some
approaches to claim that there is neither a TP (Tense Phrase) nor a VP projection
in such constructions, which in turn implies that the TP and VP projections may
not be universal. Arabic dialects are good testing grounds for this debate. They
display a temporal system that is not easy to characterize morphologically and
they do not have a verbal copula in the present tense.1 In this chapter, we provide
crucial data for this debate and argue that the most warranted conclusion is that
Arabic has a TP projection in all the main tenses, i.e. past, present, and future,
but no VP projection in present tense verbless constructions. We then discuss the
implications of this conclusion. The chapter starts with a brief overview of the CP
(Complementizer Phrase) layer and then turns to a more detailed discussion of
the TP layer and its interaction with the verb. The syntax of the so-called verbless
sentences is dealt with at the end of the chapter.
1 Except in generic sentences where an overt copula is possible. See Moutaouakil (1987)
and Benmamoun (2000).

2.2
The CP layer
There are two broad classes of complementizers in Arabic: complemen-
tizers that occur in the context of ﬁnite clauses (1) and complementizers that occur
in the context of non-ﬁnite clauses (2).2

c. rafaD
ʔənno yi-drus
Lebanese Arabic

‘He refused to study.’
In Standard Arabic, ʔanna heads ﬁnite clauses and ʔan introduces non-ﬁnite ones.3
Moroccan Arabic, like Standard Arabic, has two different complementizers intro-
ducing ﬁnite and non-ﬁnite clauses, bəlli and baˇs respectively. Lebanese Arabic
has only one complementizer, ʔənno, which may occur in both types of clauses. In
contrast with Standard Arabic, which requires the complementizer ʔan to occur in
non-ﬁnite complement clauses, Moroccan Arabic non-ﬁnite complement clauses
are not always headed by the complementizer baˇs (3–5). In Lebanese Arabic, there
are generally no complementizers in such contexts, but ʔənno can occur (6).
2 We gloss the complementizers that occur in the context of non-ﬁnite clauses as Comp.
Notice that when we use the term “non-ﬁnite” we mean that the sentence does not have
an independent temporal interpretation. There is a widespread assumption that there are
no inﬁnitives in Arabic (see below).
3 In line with Mohammad (2000), we characterize ʔan as a complementizer.

An important difference between Standard Arabic and the modern Arabic dialects
is that in the former the complementizer that takes ﬁnite clause complements
assigns Accusative Case to the embedded “subject” as is evident from the
Accusative Case marker on l-walad ‘the child’ in (7a) and the accusative clitic -hu
attached to the complementizer in (7b).4
4 See chapter 3 for a more detailed discussion of the syntactic status of “subjects” in Arabic
and their syntactic distribution.

b. ʔaʕtaqidu ʔanna-hu ya-lʕabu
believe.1s that-him 3-play
‘I believe that he is playing.’
The modern dialects have lost overt Case marking and we therefore cannot
test whether the embedded preverbal lexical “subject” is assigned Case by the
complementizer. However, the dialects do have accusative and genitive clitics.
Interestingly, in Moroccan Arabic the embedded “subject” cannot be realized as a
clitic on the complementizer (8), but it can be in Lebanese Arabic (9).

The fact that the complementizer assigns Case to the adjacent noun phrase raises
an important question about the status of the so-called embedded “subject” with
respect to Case Theory.5 If the preverbal NP that is assigned Case by the com-
plementizer is indeed a subject then, under standard assumptions, it is assigned
Case by T. This results in the subject NP being assigned Case by two different
heads, the complementizer (head of CP) and the tense (head of TP/IP). It is not
clear however that the NP assigned Case by the complementizer is a subject and
is overtly located in [Spec, TP]. It is plausible that it is located in an A′-projection
between CP and TP, binding a resumptive pronoun in a lower projection in the
A-domain of the clause, perhaps either TP or VP. This might provide a solution for
the problem of double Case marking but this option is only viable for the contexts
5 The main principle of Case Theory within the Principles and Parameters approach is
the requirement – the so-called Case Filter – that NPs in argument positions must be
assigned case (Chomsky 1981). Accusative Case is usually assigned by verbs while
Nominative Case is assigned by tense or agreement under some versions of Case Theory.
Nominative and Accusative Cases are considered structural. Cases assigned by nouns and
some prepositions are considered inherent (Chomsky 1986), though this is a matter of
debate within Semitic and Arabic syntax (Fassi Fehri 1993; Siloni 1997). The status of
abstract Case within the Minimalist Program is not clear. (Structural) Case is a non-
interpretable feature in the sense of Chomsky (1995), yet it is not clear what its syntactic
role is. See Pesetsky and Torrego (2007) for a possible approach.

Clause structure in Arabic
where the verbal head inﬂects for the full set of agreement features required to
identify the putative null resumptive pronoun subject. It is a problematic solution
for the so-called verbless sentences such as (10), where there is no overt verbal
head that could be said to carry the agreement features to identify the putative null
subject pronoun.
(10)
a. ʔaʕtaqidu ʔanna l-walad-a
ﬁi l-bayt-i
Standard Arabic
believe.1s that
the-child-Acc in the-house-Gen
‘I believe that the child is in the house.’
b. ta-n-Dən
bəlli l-wəld
f-d-dar
Moroccan Arabic
Asp-1-believe that the-child in-the-house
‘I believe that the child is in the house.’
c. biʕtiʔid
ʔənno l-bənt
b-l-beet
Lebanese Arabic
believe.1s that
the-girl in-the-house
‘I believe that the girl is in the house.’
In (10) the embedded NP following the complementizer is assigned Accusative
Case as shown by the Accusative Case marker in (10a).6 However, the PP predi-
cate does not carry the necessary agreement features to identify a null pronominal.
Hence the subject in those sentences cannot be a null pronoun. The most plau-
sible conclusion is that the embedded accusative NP is in the subject position,
which again raises questions with respect to double Case marking. One possibility
discussed in Mohammad (2000) is to assume that heads are endowed with Case
features which they must discharge. Then, in (10), both T and C discharge their
Case feature onto the NP subject. The Case feature that is overtly realized is the
one assigned by the highest head; in (10), this head is C. If, on the other hand,
the subject remains lower than the predicate and another NP occupies the position
between the predicate and the complementizer, the subject gets Nominative Case
from T and the other NP gets Accusative Case from C, as shown by sentence (11)
from Mohammad (2000:108).7
6 In the absence of an overt lexical NP in Lebanese Arabic, an accusative clitic appears on
the complementizer, as illustrated in (i):
(i)
biʕtiʔid
ʔənn-a
b-l-beet
believe.1s that-3fs.Acc in-the-house
‘I believe that she is at home.’
7 If the idea that an NP can receive more than one Case is correct, then Case assignment
by the complementizer needs to be constrained by locality, otherwise we would need
to ﬁnd a way to prevent a lower subject from getting Accusative Case from a higher
complementizer.

2.2 The CP layer
17
(11)
qultu
ʔinna-hu waSala
l-ʔawlaad-u
said.1s that-it
arrived.3ms the-children-Nom
‘I said that the boys arrived.’
In (11) the accusative expletive -hu is cliticized onto the complementizer ʔinna
and the lexical subject l-ʔawlaad-u following the verb is in the nominative form.
Thus, (11) clearly demonstrates that there are two structural Cases available in the
functional domain delimited by TP and CP.8
As for the embedded non-ﬁnite clauses, one important observation to make
about them is that they do not allow subject-to-subject raising (12).
(12)
Standard Arabic
a. ya-ˇzibu ʔan ya-drusa
l-ʔawlaad-u
3-must that 3-study.subj the-boys-Nom
‘The boys must study.’
b. *l-ʔawlaad-u
ya-ˇzibuuna ʔan ya-drusuu
the-boys-Nom 3-must.mp that 3-study.mp
As illustrated by the unacceptability of (12b), raising of the embedded subject
in (12a) to the higher clause is blocked. On the basis of these facts Moham-
mad (2000) concludes that there is no subject-to-subject raising in Standard
Arabic.9 Mohammad attributes this generalization to the absence of inﬁni-
tives in Arabic. That is, the embedded clauses in sentences such as (12a) can
license the subject, which is assigned Nominative Case. This amounts to say-
ing that, in Arabic, the non-ﬁnite TP is able to assign Case to a subject. The
Case assignment abilities attributed to non-ﬁnite TPs in Arabic may be related
to the fact that the verbs in these contexts are fully inﬂected for agreement
features.
In brief, the ability to assign Case is one of the signiﬁcant properties of the
complementizers that take ﬁnite clause complements in Arabic, with important
implications for the status of the preverbal NP and Case assignment in the grammar.
Complementizers of non-ﬁnite clauses head sentences that can license a lexical
subject and hence do not allow subject-to-subject raising.
8 The Cases are structural, rather than inherent, under the assumption that inherent Case is
restricted to elements that receive a thematic role from the Case assigner. This is not the
case in (11).
9 We have slightly modiﬁed the transcription used by Mohammad to be consistent with the
transcription used in this book.

18
Clause structure in Arabic
2.3
Tense in Arabic
As can be observed in many languages, the subject of ﬁnite clauses in
Arabic takes Nominative Case. In Standard Arabic, this Case is realized overtly
on the noun by the sufﬁx -u:
(13)
daxala
l-walad-u
Standard Arabic
entered.3ms the-child-Nom
‘The child came.’
In the modern dialects, where overt Case marking on lexical NPs has disappeared,
the Nominative Case on the subject of ﬁnite clauses is only seen when pronouns are
used. In Lebanese Arabic, for instance, only the independent form of the pronoun
can be used in subject position (14).
(14)
huwwe b-l-beet
Lebanese Arabic
he
in-the-house
‘He is in the house.’
These independent pronouns cannot be used in non-subject positions, as illustrated
by the unacceptability of (15).
(15)
*ˇsəft
huwwe
saw.1s he
‘I saw him.’
The standard assumption within the Principles and Parameters framework is
that Nominative Case is intimately related to the presence of a tense head. Tense
heads a projection located between CP and VP, and Nominative Case is assigned
in that projection.
2.3.1
Projecting tense in Arabic
Under those assumptions, we are led to posit a tense projection in Arabic,
where the subject in (14) is assigned Case. There is also independent evidence for
such a projection. First, expletive subjects, which are assumed not to be generated
within the thematic shell (VP), but are rather required by the EPP, a property of the
tense head, are possible in Arabic, as illustrated in (16) from Standard Arabic.10
10 It is not clear what the EPP property really is. The proposals vary between the EPP being
the requirement for a subject (Chomsky 1981), the requirement to check the nominal
categorical feature [+D] of T (Chomsky 1995), or just the requirement that a category
be in [Spec, T] (or C for that matter; Chomsky 2000).

(16)
hunaaka walad-un ya-drusu ﬁi l-bayt-i
Standard Arabic
there
boy-Nom 3-study
in the-house-Gen
‘A boy is studying in the house.’
Second, as we will discuss in greater detail in chapter 5, in Standard Arabic,
tense is realized on the sentential negative particle rather than on the verb. Thus,
in (17a) past tense is realized on the sentential negative lam and in (17b) future
tense is realized on the sentential negative lan.
(17)
a. lam
ta-ktub
Neg.past 3f-write
‘She didn’t write.’
b. lan
ta-ktuba
Neg.fut 3f-write
‘She won’t write.’
These facts can be straightforwardly captured if tense occupies its own projection
in the Arabic clause structure.

The host for tense is the closest possible host. Given the representation in (18),
in the context of sentential negation, the closest host is the negative head. In the
absence of sentential negation, the closest host is the verb. However, this analysis
relies crucially on the notion that tense is projected separately from the verb,
heading its own projection (Benmamoun 1992a).
2.3.2
The morphology of tense
As in other Semitic languages, verbs in Arabic dialects display two
morphological patterns, the so-called perfective and imperfective forms. By way
of illustration, we present these two forms in Lebanese Arabic, Moroccan Arabic,
and Standard Arabic. As can be observed from the lists below, the dialects differ

from each other with respect to the richness and degrees of syncretism in their
paradigm.

Starting with the perfective paradigm, this form occurs almost exclusively in

There are at least two possible approaches to analyze the perfective form of the
verb in Arabic. On one hand, one could advance the view that the sufﬁx on the
verb in the perfective realizes both tense and agreement.11 On the other hand, one
could argue that the sufﬁx on the verb in the perfective realizes only agreement
and that the verb in Arabic does not inﬂect for tense.
Under the analysis that the sufﬁx in the perfective paradigm realizes past tense
(in addition to agreement), the prediction is that the sufﬁx should only occur
in the context of the past tense. However, this prediction is not borne out. The
sufﬁx occurs on negative laysa in (23) and aspectual particles such as laazaala
in sentences with present tense interpretation (24), as Benmamoun (1992a, 2000)
shows.

11 There is also the view that the Arabic verbs encode aspect but not tense, leading to the
characterization of Arabic as an aspectual language. As we will show below, the verbs
in Arabic carry neither tense nor aspect.
12 The aspectual particle consists of the negative laa and the verb zaal.

The presence of the same sufﬁx in the perfective paradigm in the context of the
present tense clearly demonstrates that this sufﬁx is not a realization of the past
tense. The most reasonable characterization is that the sufﬁx carries agreement
only.
Note also the fact that the negative and aspectual particles inﬂect as in the verbal
perfective paradigm militates against the view that the vocalic melody on the verb
carries tense or aspect (McCarthy 1979). The vocalic melody of the root zwl of
the aspectual particle laazaala in (24) is identical to the vocalic melody of the
so-called hollow roots in Standard Arabic, i.e. roots with a medial glide. This is
illustrated in (26) with the root nwm ‘sleep,’ where the correspondences between
the forms can be clearly observed.

Moreover, as pointed out in Benmamoun (2000), Moroccan Arabic does not
have a distinct vowel melody that one could associate with a particular grammatical
tense or aspect. The only stem vowel available in Moroccan Arabic is the schwa
/ə/, a vowel that occurs as a stem vowel (after the ﬁrst root consonant) in a wide

range of contexts: past tense (27a), present tense (27b), and on nouns (27c) and
adjectives (27d).

‘He played.’
b. ta-yə-lʕəb

c. nmər

In short, the past tense in Arabic is expressed neither by the overt afﬁxes of the
perfective form, which seems to carry agreement only, nor by the vocalic melody
on the verb. Rather, it seems to be an abstract morpheme located in tense which
can be hosted by negation or by the verb, as we will discuss below.
The conclusion that the perfective form of the verb does not morpho-
phonologically encode past tense can be extended to the imperfective form as
well.13 This form, too, seems to carry neither tense nor aspect. This conclusion
is actually easier to establish for the imperfective, a form which occurs in such a
wide variety of aspectual and temporal contexts that it is impossible to attribute a
particular temporal or aspectual interpretation to it. For example, the imperfective
occurs in the context of tensed negative sentences, as illustrated in (17), repeated
here as (28).

a. lam
ta-ktub
Neg.past 3f-write
‘She didn’t

b. lan

The fact that the tense interpretation, past in (28a) and future in (28b), comes
from the negative particle shows that the imperfective verb does not carry tense.
The imperfective is also the form of the verb that occurs in the context of modals
13 The imperfective paradigm in Standard Arabic displays a number of so-called moods (the
indicative, subjunctive, and jussive). The issue is not directly relevant for this discussion,
but see Benmamoun (2000) for a critical overview.

The fact that the imperfective occurs in different temporal contexts shows clearly
that this form does not encode any tense, particularly not the present tense (Bahloul
1994; Ouhalla 1993); the present tense interpretation in (33) is just one context
where the imperfective can occur. Thus, on a par with the past tense, the present
tense seems to be a null abstract morpheme.14 In short, tense in Arabic seems to
be an abstract morpheme generated in T and the afﬁxes observed on the verbs in
Arabic are reﬂexes of agreement features.
We can come to a similar conclusion with respect to aspect in Arabic. This
conclusion is easy to establish in the modern Arabic dialects, which have their
own aspectual markers that may attach to the imperfective form of the verb. Thus,
in Moroccan Arabic (34a) and Lebanese Arabic (34b) the progressive aspect is
realized by the proclitic particles ta- and ʕam respectively.15,16
(34)

b. ʕam yiʔra

The main difference to be noted between the perfective and imperfective forms
of the verb in Arabic concerns how agreement is realized. In the perfective,
14 Future tense in Arabic is realized by independent particles or proclitics.
15 Standard Arabic does not have overt particles or clitics on the verb to express progressive
or habitual aspect. The bare imperfective form of the verb is used in those contexts.
16 Moroccan Arabic has another particle, ka-, that alternates with ta- in some dialects or
even within the same dialect.

2.3 Tense in Arabic
27
all agreement features are realized by a sufﬁx on the verb. In the imperfective,
agreement is realized discontinuously, with the preﬁx carrying mainly person and
the sufﬁx mainly number, a fact that will turn out to be signiﬁcant when we try to
analyze the relation between tense and the verb in the present and past tenses.
2.3.3
The syntax of tense
Starting with the observed interaction between tense and negation, we
hinted that the fact that past tense in Standard Arabic occurs on the negative
particle can easily be explained by generating negation between TP and VP ((18)
is repeated below as (35)).

If the negative projection is absent, the verb can raise and merge with tense. On
the other hand, if negation is present, verb movement across it would violate
Relativized Minimality (Rizzi 1990) or the Head Movement Constraint of Travis
(1984).17 The fact that the past tense is realized on negation suggests that the
abstract tense head needs lexical support, hence the inﬂected negative.
With respect to negation in the context of the present tense, we ﬁrst notice that
there is no negative form dedicated to the present tense. The negative that occurs
in this context, laa, occurs also as constituent negation (36a), and on negative
quantiﬁers (36b).
17 The main idea behind Relativized Minimality is that licensing relations across c-
commanding elements of the same type are not allowed. Thus, an NP cannot license a
reﬂexive across another c-commanding NP; a wh-phrase, particularly if it is extracted
from a subject or adjunct position, cannot license its trace across another intervening
wh-phrase that c-commands its trace; a head, such as a verb, cannot license its trace
across another head. The latter is essentially a recapitulation of the Head Movement
Constraint of Travis (1984) which bans movement of a head across another intervening
head.

b. laa ʔa¯had

The fact that there is no present tense form of negation may be explained if the
present tense head in T does not need to be lexically supported and therefore does
not force verb movement or merger with negation. Thus, though both the past and
present tenses are abstract heads of T, only the former requires lexical support.
2.4
Verb displacement in Arabic
Independent evidence is available for the conclusion that, while the
abstract past tense head requires lexical support in Arabic, the present tense head,
also an abstract head, does not. There are a number of intriguing facts in Arabic,
discussed in Benmamoun (2000), which seem to be consistent with the analysis
that the past tense forces verb movement while the present tense head does not.
First, let us return to the agreement morpheme paradigms in the imperfective
and perfective. Recall that agreement in the perfective is exclusively realized by
sufﬁxes but in the imperfective the person feature is realized by a preﬁx and the
number feature by a sufﬁx. It is assumed within historical studies of Semitic lan-
guages such as Arabic that the person morpheme evolved out of a pronoun (Gray
1934). The number morpheme, on the other hand, may be a marker of agreement
and concord. Conﬁning our attention to the person morpheme, let us assume that
the subject in Arabic may remain in a position lower than tense. If the past tense
must attract the verb, we predict the pronominal subject to follow the verb in T, as
illustrated in (37).

In the conﬁguration in (37) the only form of cliticization that the pronoun can
undergo is encliticization. Thus, the obligatory movement of the verb in the past
tense accounts for the fact that the person agreement morpheme is a sufﬁx in the
so-called perfective paradigm.
On the other hand, if the verb in the present tense does not need to move to T,
the verb should be able to remain lower than the subject, providing the latter with
only one cliticization option, namely procliticization. Thus, what we get is person
preﬁxation in the so-called imperfective paradigm.

Another intriguing piece of evidence comes from idiomatic expressions or so-
called God wishes discussed in Ferguson (1983) and Bahloul (1994). Consider
the following idiomatic expressions from Moroccan Arabic.
(39)
a. ra¯hm-u
llah
bless.past.3ms-him God
‘May God bless him.’
b. llah y-rə¯hm-u
God 3-blessed-him
‘May God bless him.’
Notice that the past tense form of the idiom displays the VS order but the present
tense form displays the SV order. This can be explained if in the past tense the verb
must move to T, a position higher than the subject, yielding the VS pattern. On
the other hand, in the present tense the verb does not need to move to T, resulting
in the SV pattern.
In addition to the diachronic arguments given above, we ﬁnd evidence for the
syntactic asymmetry between verbs in past tense sentences and verbs in present
tense sentences in the modern Arabic dialects as well.
In Egyptian Arabic, the past tense verb must merge with sentential negation
(40) but it does not have to do so in the present tense (41). Merger with negation

30

is indicated by the fact that the verb is sandwiched between the two discontinuous
parts of the sentential negation ma, and -ˇs, which do not have to be separated, as
shown in (41b).

The facts in (40–41) (from Jelinek 1981:41) can be accounted for as follows. To
avoid a violation of minimality, the verb in the modern dialects of Arabic moves
to T in the past tense, by going through the negative head (Benmamoun 1992a),
hence merger with negation. By contrast, in the present tense, tense does not force
verb movement, hence merger with negation does not obtain and maˇs appears
preceding the verb (42).18
It is highly plausible that the future tense projects a TP node above the VP,
because future tense is realized either by a morphologically independent marker
((43a) and (44)) or by a proclitic (43b).
18 If the verb moves in the present tense, it is most probably due to some property of
negation. This property forces movement in Moroccan Arabic and Lebanese Arabic
where merger with negation is obligatory, but not in Egyptian Arabic, as illustrated in
(41).

b. ra¯h yi-drus

In Standard Arabic, given that future tense can be realized on the negative we
are led to argue that there is a future tense feature generated in T, which is realized
as sawfa or its clitic variant sa-.19 In the context of negation, the negative merges
with T and the complex is realized morphologically as lan. In the other modern
dialects, it is not clear that there is a future tense marker in T. Let us consider the
Moroccan Arabic and Lebanese Arabic “future” markers γ adi, in (44a), and ra¯h,
in (44b). Moroccan Arabic γ adi is a participle form of the root of motiond, which
means ‘go.’ Lebanese Arabic ra¯h is the perfective form of the root of motion rw¯h,
which also means ‘go.’ These forms can be used as the main predicate of motion
as illustrated in (45).

That the predicate of motion in Moroccan Arabic (45a) is the same as the marker
of “future” tense is supported by the fact that unlike the future markers sawfa and
sa- in Standard Arabic, γadi, when used in future tense contexts, may carry the
19 The fact that the imperfective form of the verb is used in the context of future tense may
indicate that the verb does not actually need to move to T. The cliticization of sa- on the
verb in Standard Arabic may not necessarily require movement of the latter.

same inﬂections, such as the feminine marker in (46b) and the plural marker in
(47b), as it does when it is used as a motion verb ((46a) and (47a)).

they
going.p to-the-house
‘They are going home.’
b. huma γady-n yə-qra-w
they

‘They will study.’
Though the agreement inﬂection on γ adi is optional when used to mark future
tense, the fact that in future tense contexts it may inﬂect like a regular participle
suggests that the sentences containing γ adi are interpreted as future tense but
syntactically they are present tense sentences with γ adi heading a VP projection
below TP (and negation). In other words, syntactically, the sentence in (44) is a
prospective present tense sentence in the sense of Comrie (1976).
If this analyis is on the right track we predict that in dialects where the verb in the
present tense does not move past the tense head, the “future” tense marker should
occur below sentential negation. This prediction is borne out as the following
Egyptian Arabic example from Brustad (2000:285) illustrates.20
(48)
miˇs ¯ha-yi-bʔa
¯hilw
ʕalayya
Egyptian Arabic
Neg will-3-become pretty on-me
‘It won’t look good on me.’
The “future” tense verb in Egyptian Arabic behaves exactly on a par with the verbs
in the present tense, which do not move to T. Thus, past tense in Arabic can be said
to project a TP node headed by an abstract past tense feature. Similarly, the present
tense projects a TP node headed by an abstract present tense feature. However, the
two tenses are radically different. The past tense triggers verb movement to T while
20 We modiﬁed the transcription and the gloss slightly to be consistent with the conventions
used in this book.

2.5 Motivating verb movement to tense
33
the present tense does not. Diachronically, this explains the contrast between the
perfective verb and the imperfective verb with respect to the afﬁxation of the person
agreement morphology and word order in idiomatic expressions. Synchronically,
the verb in the past tense merges with negation because it must move to T through
the negative projection located between TP and VP. In the present tense, the verb
does not need to move to tense (but it can move to negation), yielding the possible
lack of merger of negation and tense in Egyptian Arabic in the present tense.
2.5
Motivating verb movement to tense
Given the analysis under which the verb undergoes movement in past
tense sentences but does not have to move in present tense sentences, the question
that can be raised at this point is about the property of the past tense that forces
movement.
One long-held view is that processes that derive complex words from simple
lexical items in the syntax, such as verb merger with tense and other functional cat-
egories, verb or noun incorporation, and perhaps also cliticization, are all driven by
the need to provide morphological hosts for phonologically deﬁcient elements.21
The problem is that, since both the past tense and present tense are abstract mor-
phemes, it is not obvious how phonological dependency can distinguish between
the two.
Recent developments within the Minimalist Program, particularly Chomsky
(1995), provide a possible solution that doesn’t depend on phonological deﬁciency.
According to Chomsky (1995), tense is speciﬁed for the categorical features [+D]
(for nominal) and [+V] (for verbal). In English and French, for example, this
accounts for the dependency between tense and the subject (EPP), on one hand,
and tense and the verb, on the other. The dependency between tense and the subject
explains subject movement to TP, and the dependency between tense and the verb
explains V movement to T.
This analysis may be a viable alternative to account for the contrast between the
past tense and the present tense in Arabic. Thus, suppose that in Arabic present
tense is speciﬁed for the [+D] feature only while the past tense is speciﬁed for
both the [+D] and [+V] features, as illustrated in (49) and (50) respectively:22
21 The idea is that a phonologically dependent element must have a lexical host to be realized
in the morphology. This idea has driven analyses of head movement and cliticization but
has also been questioned given its reliance on an essentially phonological condition to
drive a presumably syntactic process.
22 Though under Chomsky’s (1995) analysis, the categorical feature speciﬁcations are
presumably assumed to be universal, there is no reason why that should be the case.

Restricting our attention to the verbal feature, since the past tense is speciﬁed
for this feature, it follows within Chomsky’s minimalist approach, that [+V] will
attract the verb, which moves to T as a result. The present tense, by contrast, is
not speciﬁed for [+V] and therefore no dependency is established between T and
the verb. This accurately captures the various facts that suggest that the verb must
move to T in the past tense but not in the present tense. Moreover, it explains why
there is no verbal copula in the present tense but there must be one in the past.
The copula is needed in order for the past tense to establish a dependency with the
verb.
Interestingly, grounding the dependency between the verb and the past in
a verbal feature captures one fact that a phonologically based analysis can-
not capture, namely that the verbal copula must be present even when tense is
hosted by negation (51). This fact, pointed out by Moutaouakil (1987), clearly
shows that the presence of the verbal copula is not required to realize the past
tense, since it is the negative particle in Standard Arabic that realizes it, as in
(51b).

2.6 The syntax of verbless sentences
35
Thus, the dependency between tense and the verb does not seem to be grounded
morpho-phonologically. Rather, the distribution of the verbal copula suggests that
the dependency is grounded in a requirement that past tense be paired with a verbal
element.
2.6
The syntax of verbless sentences
As has already been observed, Arabic is a language (family) that allows
sentences to have verbless predicates. An independent sentence in the present tense
in Arabic may have only a subject and a non-verbal predicate.23 The predicate can
be a noun phrase, an adjective phrase, or a prepositional phrase, as illustrated by
the sentences in (52) from Moroccan Arabic, the sentences in (53) from Standard
Arabic, and (54) from Lebanese Arabic.

Despite the richness of the literature on this topic, there is still no consen-
sus on the clause structure of the sentences such as the ones we have in (52–
54). The debate generally centers around the issue of whether they are full
clauses with the same set of functional and lexical categories as the copu-
lar constructions containing verbal copulas in the past tense (55a–57a), or the
future tense (55b–57b), or whether they are small clauses consisting of a pro-
jection of the main predicates with no verbal or functional projections above
it.

We will show that neither approach is entirely correct. Let us start with the
analysis that the sentences in (55–57) contain a verbal copula that is null, i.e. the
equivalent of kan ‘was’ in present tense sentences.

The representation in (58) preserves the assumption that clauses have a universal
schema consisting of a TP layer that dominates a VP layer. It is also consistent with
the idea that TP (and CP) may be an extended projection of the VP (Grimshaw
1991). However, there is no evidence that there is a verbal element in the sentences
where no verbal copula appears, in (55–57). There are several arguments based
on Case assignment, selection, and minimality effects, which are problematic for
the null verbal copula analysis.
As is well known, the overt copulas in Standard Arabic assign Accusative Case
to the nominal and adjectival predicate(s), as illustrated in (59) and (60).

38
Clause structure in Arabic
In (59–60) the verbal copula kaana/yakuunu ‘be’ assigns Accusative Case to
the predicate muʕallim ‘teacher,’ which, in each sentence, carries the Accusative
Case marker -a(n). By contrast, in the present tense sentence in (61), the pred-
icate is not marked for Accusative Case but for Nominative Case. The latter
Case is usually the default Case in Arabic carried by elements that are not struc-
turally Case marked, such as (clitic-)left dislocated noun phrases, and nouns in
isolation.
(61)
a. r-raˇzul-u
muʕallim-un
the-man-Nom teacher-Nom
‘The man is a teacher.’
b. *r-raˇzul-u
muʕallim-an
the-man-Nom teacher-Acc
If the sentence in (61a) has a verbal copula, it is not clear why it cannot
assign Accusative Case, yielding the opposite acceptability judgments. It is also
important to point out that the Case on the predicate does not depend on the
tense of the clause; there are in fact present tense sentences involving nega-
tive heads (62) and aspectual heads (63) that can assign Accusative Case to the
predicate.
(62)
Standard Arabic
a. laysa r-raˇzul-u

Turning to selection, it is probably a cross-linguistic fact that modal heads select
verbal complements. In Arabic dialects, this is clearly the case, as the following
sentences from various Arabic dialects show.
(64)
a. yə-qdər yə-mˇsi

‘He may/can go.’

d. leezəm

If the present tense verbless sentences in (52–54) do contain a null copula, they
should, all else being equal, allow for the occurrence of a modal head. This
prediction does not obtain, as shown by the ungrammaticality of the examples in
(65) and (66).

The only conclusion that can be drawn from the above examples is that there
is no null copula. In fact, if we insert the imperfective form of the copula in the
sentences in (65) and (66), they become acceptable.

Recall that the imperfective form of the verb is the form that occurs in the
present tense in Arabic dialects, thus the observed contrast between (65–66) and
(67–68) casts serious doubt on the null copula analysis of present tense verbless
sentences. Therefore, the question that remains is why the imperfective form of
the copula cannot occur in the sentences in (55–57).
Let us turn next to minimality. Here, too, there is no evidence for a null verbal
copula. Simplifying somewhat, minimality effects arise when an element moves
or establishes a dependency across another element of the same category (level).
We can appeal to minimality effects to explain why the adjective in (69a) cannot
merge with negation (69b). The reason is that the merger of the adjective with
negation must take place across the verbal copula. The movement would violate
minimality because the copula is a closer head to negation.
(69)
Moroccan Arabic
a. ʕomar ma-kan-ˇs
mRiD
Omar Neg-was.3ms-Neg ill
‘Omar was not ill.’
b. *ʕomar ma-mRiD-ˇs kan
Omar
Neg-ill-Neg was.3ms
However, in Moroccan Arabic the adjective can optionally merge with negation
as long as no other element intervenes, i.e., as long as the movement does not
violate minimality. Thus (69b) becomes acceptable in the absence of the copula
kan ‘was,’ as illustrated in (70b).
(70)
a. ʕomar ma-ˇsi
mRiD
Omar Neg-Neg ill
‘Omar is not ill.’
b. ʕomar ma-mRiD-ˇs
Omar Neg-ill-Neg
‘Omar is not ill.’
However, under the approach that assumes the existence of a null copula in
verbless sentences, the movement of the adjective to merge with negation to

42
Clause structure in Arabic
derive (70b) would still violate minimality. We expect (70b) to be on a par with
(69b). This is contrary to fact. The reasonable conclusion then is that there is no
null copula in present tense verbless sentences.
In short, the sentences in (55–57) do not display a null copula and consequently
do not have a VP. The question then is whether such sentences are just small
clauses containing the minimal structure that is the result of the merger of the
predicate and its subject or whether they contain additional functional structure,
particularly the category T.
It was argued here that there is a tense projection in sentences with verbal
predicates. Present tense sentences lack verb movement to tense, and as such they
contrast with past tense sentences. This idea provides a straightforward analysis
for the distribution of the copula: there is a copula in the past tense sentences
because tense attracts the verb and if there is no verb in the sentence, one must be
inserted, hence the obligatory presence of the verbal copula in past tense sentences.
In the present tense sentences, however, tense does not attract the verb, hence there
is no need for a verbal copula in present tense sentences.24
One may argue that the sentences in (55–57) consist of the lexical layer only,
with a default present tense interpretation. That is, one could argue for the absence
of all functional structure above the lexical layer. However, there are reasons not
to accept this proposal. The so-called verbless sentences display the syntax of full
tensed clauses.
It can be shown that verbless sentences pattern with ﬁnite clauses with respect
to the licensing of negative polarity items (NPIs) in Moroccan Arabic. Embedded
verbless sentences with no overt complementizer are islands for NPI licensing
(71a). In this respect, they pattern with embedded verbless sentences headed by
an overt complementizer (71b).
(71)

b. *ma-tanDən
bəlli ¯hətta wa¯həd f-d-dar
Neg-believe.1s that

Thus, embedded verbless sentences behave like ﬁnite clauses rather than embedded
non-ﬁnite clauses, which allow for licensing of an embedded NPI by the negative
in the higher clause, as illustrated in (72).

24 The future may have a modal feature that requires a verbal copula.

2.6 The syntax of verbless sentences
43
This parallelism between verbless sentences and ﬁnite clauses with respect to NPI
licensing supports the analysis that verbless sentences have a full clause structure
with the relevant projections that deﬁne the locality domain for long-distance
dependencies, namely ﬁnite T and perhaps even C.
Another argument for projecting a TP in verbless sentences comes from Case
assignment. The subject of verbless sentences appears in the Nominative Case in
Standard Arabic (73), which is arguably a Case assigned to subjects by tense.
(73)
a. ʕaliy-un muʕallim-un
Ali-Nom teacher-Nom
‘Ali is a teacher.’
b. al-Vurfat-u
kabiirat-un
the-room-Nom big-Nom
‘The room is big.’
c. l-kitaab-u
ʕalaa l-maktab-i
the-book-Nom on
the-desk-Gen
‘The book is on the desk.’
It is clear that the Nominative Case on the subject in (73) is structural and not
the default nominative that appears on elements that are (clitic-)left dislocated.25
Therefore, the subject in those sentences must have structural Case, which can
only come from tense in those contexts. Moreover, the fact that an exple-
tive can occur in verbless sentences (74) demonstrates that such sentences
contain functional categories. This is so because expletives are not required
and are not licensed by lexical categories but rather by functional categories,
particularly T.
(74)
hunaaka Taalib-un
ﬁi l-bayt-i
Standard Arabic
there
student-Nom in the-house-Gen
‘There is a student in the house.’
Movement of the subject across negation also argues, albeit indirectly, for a
functional projection headed by tense to dominate the lexical predicate in verbless
sentences. Consider the contrast between the sentences in (75) and those in (76)
from Moroccan Arabic.
25 Left dislocation in Arabic is generally accompanied by resumption (see chapter 8).
That is, the dislocated phrase is generally related to a pronominal element within
the sentence. Since the predicates in the sentences in (73) do not show full agree-
ment that would identify/license a null pronominal, and in the absence of a related
pronoun, the left peripheral NP in those sentences cannot be considered a dislocated
element.

not
Omar teacher
b. *maˇsi d-dar
kbira
not
the-house big
c. *maˇsi lə-ktab
fuq l-məktəb
not
the-book on the-desk
The main difference between those paradigms is that in (75) the subject precedes
sentential negation while it follows it in (76). One plausible reason for this dif-
ference is that the subject must move to TP to satisfy some property of T, such
as the EPP.26 On the other hand, if there are no functional categories in verbless
sentences it is not clear why the movement of the subject is forced and why the
sentences in (76) are all unacceptable.27
26 The EPP (Extended Projection Principle), in its original incarnation (see Chomsky 1981),
refers to the requirement that sentences must have subjects, which can be fulﬁlled by
base-generation (of NPs or expletives) or movement of NPs (as in passives and subject-
to-subject raising constructions) (see also footnote 10). Recently, it has been argued
that this movement of the subject may not be necessary when there is a verb in the
sentence inﬂected for agreement. It is plausible that agreement on the verb can fulﬁll
the EPP, thus obviating the movement of the verb (Alexiadou and Anagnostopoulou
1999; Benmamoun 2000). Within recent versions of the Minimalist Program, the EPP
essentially reduces to a requirement that an overt expression be in the speciﬁer position
of a phrase with the appropriate EPP feature (Chomsky 2004).
27 Other facts are consistent with the analysis that argues for a TP in the clause structure of
verbless sentences in Arabic. For instance, verbless sentences allow temporal adverbs,
as illustrated in (i) from Moroccan Arabic:
(i)
ʕomar f-d-dar
daba
Omar at-the-home now
‘Omar is at home now.’
If temporal adverbs must be syntactically anchored by tense, then there must be a tense
projection in verbless sentences. See Mughazy (2004) for a detailed discussion about

2.7 Conclusion

In sum, we conclude that there are strong reasons to support the structure of
verbless sentences given in (77) (see Jelinek 1981).28

Conclusion
In this chapter, we discussed two core functional categories in the Arabic
clause. Starting with the complementizer layer, we isolated two types of com-
plementizers, a complementizer that occurs in the context of ﬁnite complement
clauses and a complementizer that occurs in the context of non-ﬁnite complement
clauses. With respect to the former, one intriguing property that has important syn-
tactic implications concerns its ability to assign (Accusative) Case to the embedded
subject. This fact raises important questions about the status of the embedded pre-
verbal “subject” and its Case properties. We then discussed tense in various Arabic
dialects, with a special focus on the syntactic differences between the past tense
and the present tense. After establishing that both tenses are not realized morpho-
logically but are rather abstract features that head syntactic (TP) projections, we
provided arguments to show that the two tenses are very different syntactically.
The past tense seems to require movement of the verb to tense while the present
tense does not. This property seems to explain different empirical generalizations
regarding the position of the person agreement morpheme in the verbal paradigm,
word order in idiomatic expressions, the ability to merge with sentential negation,
and the presence or absence of the copula in the context of non-verbal predicates.
Finally, we discussed verbless sentences, which are constructions that do not dis-
play a copula in the present tense. We have shown that they project a TP but
no VP.

The syntax of subjects
3.1
Introduction
One of the most controversial issues in Arabic syntax concerns the posi-
tion of the subject. As far as we know, in all dialects the subject can occur: before
the verb and the object, displaying as such the Subject Verb Object (SVO) sequence
(1); between the verb and the object, displaying the familiar Verb Subject Object
(VSO) sequence (2); or after the verb and the object, displaying the Verb Object
Subject (VOS) sequence (3).

On the other hand, the orders illustrated in (4–6) are not allowed in many Arabic
dialects. Mohammad (2000) has shown this on the basis of the data from Palestinian
Arabic reproduced here. The same facts can be shown to obtain in Moroccan Arabic
and Lebanese Arabic.

In (4) the object precedes the V-S sequence while in (5) it precedes the S-V
sequence. In(6), theobject occurs betweenthesubject andtheverb. All theseorders
are not acceptable in Moroccan Arabic, Lebanese Arabic and, as Mohammad
(2000) also shows, Palestinian Arabic.
However, the OVS, OSV, and SOV orders are possible if the object is resumed
by a pronominal clitic on the verb, which initially suggests that the object (and

48
The syntax of subjects
in the SOV order the subject) is not within the A-domain but is rather in the
A′-domain of the clause, as a (clitic-)left dislocated NP.1

1 The OVS, OSV, and SOV orders illustrated in (4–6) also become acceptable if the object
is contrastively focused. In such contexts, the object receives focal stress and is not related
to a pronominal clitic on the verb. However, it can be said that in those constructions,
as in clitic-left dislocation constructions, the object is not in the A-domain but in the
A′-domain of the main clause. We discuss (clitic-)left dislocation and focus constructions
in full detail in chapters 8 and 9.

3.2 Subject position(s)
49
In this chapter, we limit our attention to the syntactic distribution of subjects,
and in particular to the SVO and VSO orders, which have received most of the
attention in the relevant literature.
3.2
Subject position(s)
Given the number of positions that the subject can occupy in a sentence,
the question that arises is whether all those positions are genuine subject positions.
Genuine subject positions are designated as such in the sense that they are reserved
for the subject within the A-domain of a clause.
3.2.1
Two subject positions
There is a general consensus within the Principles and Parameters frame-
work that there are at least two positions within the clause that genuine subjects
occupy (Koopman and Sportiche 1991; McCloskey 1996, 1997). One position is
reserved for thematic subjects (those that can receive a thematic role from the
predicate) and is within the thematic shell. For verbal predicates, the thematic
shell can be identiﬁed with the VP, and the corresponding structure is illustrated
in (10).2
(10)
VP

The other position that may host the subject is the speciﬁer of TP, the functional
projection that dominates the VP.

2 There are variations on this proposal. For some, the subject is actually within a predicate
phrase or a functional category that dominates the VP.

50
The syntax of subjects
Three competing proposals have been put forth to account for the distribution
of subjects in Arabic. According to one proposal, the subject in the VSO order
is within the thematic shell (i.e. the VP) while the Spec of TP is left empty or
potentially occupied by a null expletive.
(12)
Spec 
 TP
 T

In this respect Arabic would be unlike other languages such as English or
French, where it is claimed that the subject must overtly move from the Spec of
VP to the Spec of TP (Koopman and Sportiche 1991). By contrast, the subject in
the SVO order is in the Spec of TP and is related to a trace in the Spec of VP.3

Thus, unlike in languages like English or French, movement of the subject in
Arabic from the speciﬁer of VP to the speciﬁer of TP seems optional. But, as far
as the status of the preverbal subject is concerned, there is no difference between
Arabic and English/French. In all cases, the element occupying the speciﬁer of
TP is a genuine subject that occupies an A-position and displays the properties of
subjects with respect to agreement, case, and binding.
3.2.2
One subject position
A second proposal that has been advanced to account for the distribution
of subjects in Arabic claims that the only genuine overt subject occurs in the VSO
3 The crucial assumption here is that the subject must be merged within the thematic shell
so that it can receive its thematic role.

3.2 Subject position(s)
51
order and that it is located in the Spec of VP. The preverbal subject is thus not
within the A-domain, but rather a topic or a clitic-left dislocated element that
relates to or binds a resumptive pronominal clitic within the A-domain of the
clause, as illustrated in (14).4
(14)

According to this proposal, Arabic and English or French are radically different
as far as the syntax of subjects is concerned. In Arabic, the genuine subject is a
(possibly null) pronoun that is merged in the Spec of VP and related to a lexical
NP in the Spec of TP (or possibly a higher projection).
Another variation on the proposal that Arabic has one subject position is the
claim that the subject in both the VSO and SVO orders is outside the VP domain.
In the VSO order the subject is (at least) in the speciﬁer of TP with the verb in a
higher projection below CP (XP in (15)).

4 Under such an analysis, whether the preverbal subject is located in the speciﬁer of TP or
the speciﬁer of a functional projection dominating TP, that position is characterized as
an A′-position.

52
The syntax of subjects
In the SVO order both the verb and the subject could be in TP or in a higher
projection or the subject could be in a higher projection and the verb in TP. This
analysis avails itself of additional functional projections below CP that can host
the verb and the subject. What is signiﬁcant about this analysis is that it assumes
that there is one genuine subject position in the A-domain, [Spec, TP], which is
always ﬁlled by the overt subject. Thus, the difference between Arabic on one
hand, and English or French on the other, is that the verb as well as the subject in
Arabic may undergo further movement beyond TP.
There are expectedly other possible analyses that could be explored but the ones
brieﬂy mentioned here are representative of the current debate on the syntax of
subjects and the verb in Arabic and other languages. Regardless of the diversity of
the analyses, the main issues at stake remain the same, namely whether language
variation has to do with the syntax of subjects, verbs, or both, and how many
positions are available to the external argument.
3.3
Clausal structure and the status of the VP
Before going into the arguments presented for the analyses outlined
above, we discuss and dismiss one option that has also been advanced for the
syntax of VP in Arabic, namely the ﬂat structure, whereby the verb, subject, and
object are all sisters and immediate daughters of TP.5
(16)
TP 
T 
V NP
NP
subject
object 
This is a traditional analysis for Arabic (Bakir 1980). The critical claim here is that
there is no VP constituent in Arabic. This in turn implies that there should be no
processes or constructions that refer to the VP constituent. Moreover, this analysis
predicts that both the subject and the object are in a symmetric relation, which
should have implications for the syntactic relations that are sensitive to symmetry
in the structural relations between arguments.
3.3.1
Idioms
With respect to the VP constituent, Mohammad (2000) has argued that
the fact that the verb and the object can form an idiomatic expression, as in the
Palestinian Arabic sentence in (17), supports the claim that there is a VP.
5 In the text and in (16) we use TP and CP anachronistically but for the purpose of
uniformity. This analysis is more appropriately cast in terms of S and S′.

3.3 Clausal structure and the status of the VP

(17)
ʔe¯hmad Dayyaʕ ʕagl-u
Palestinian Arabic
Ahmed lost.3ms mind-his
‘Ahmad went crazy.’
Another piece of evidence that supports Mohammad’s argument comes from other
Arabic dialects, namely Moroccan Arabic and Lebanese Arabic. On a par with
English, where the semantic interpretation of the subject seems to depend on both
the verb and its complement (Marantz 1984), in the Moroccan sentences in (18)
we see that the semantic interpretation of the subject varies greatly depending on
how the verb and its complement are interpreted.
(18)

‘Mona hit Sami.’
b. mona Darabit ha-l-¯hseeb

‘Mona was prepared.’
In the Moroccan Arabic examples in (18a) and (18d) and their Lebanese Arabic
equivalents in (19), the asymmetry between subjects and objects is apparent: the
semantic interpretation of the subject in those sentences becomes clear only after

54
The syntax of subjects
the object is interpreted with respect to the verb. This is what accounts for the
difference in interpretation between (18a) and (19a) on one hand, and (18d) and
(19b), on the other.
3.3.2
VP coordination
In addition to idiomatic expressions, there are other arguments for a VP
constituent in Arabic. For example, in Lebanese Arabic as well as in Moroccan
Arabic, VPs can be conjoined, as illustrated in (20).
(20)
a. Lebanese Arabic
keen
ʕomar ʕam yiʔra
l-kteeb
w
y¯harrik T-Tabxa
was.3ms Omar Asp. reading the-book and stirring the-cooking
‘Omar was reading the book and stirring the cooking.’
b. Moroccan Arabic
kan
ʕomar tayqra
lə-ktab
w
yTəyyəb lə-ʕˇsa
was.3ms Omar reading the-book and cooking the-dinner
‘Omar was reading the book and cooking dinner.’
In (20), there is a coordination of two constituents each containing both the verb
and the object, excluding the subject. That this is indeed a coordination of VPs and
not TPs is evident from the fact that both VPs are under the scope of the aspectual
particle that is cliticized to the verb of the ﬁrst conjunct. This indicates that the
verb together with the object can form a constituent excluding the subject.
In short, the facts based on idioms and coordination clearly show that there is a
VP constituent in Arabic, by showing the asymmetry between subjects and objects
in their relation to the verb.
3.3.3
Wh-asymmetries
Mohammad (2000) also shows that, on a par with languages where there
is clear evidence for an asymmetric relation between the subject and the object
with respect to extractability, similar asymmetries seem to obtain in Arabic. For
example, it is easier to extract an object than to extract a subject which is reﬂected
by the form of the embedded complementizer. This generalization can be illustrated
for both Standard Arabic (21) and Palestinian Arabic (22).6
6 See also Kenstowicz (1989) for preverbal and postverbal asymmetries with respect to the
extraction of the subject in two Arabic dialects of Jordan.

c. ʔanu
bent gaal
ʔe¯hmad ʔenn-ha ˇsafat
ʕali
which girl said.3ms Ahmed that-she saw.3fs Ali
‘Which girl did Ahmed say that she saw Ali?’
In (21a) and (22a) the wh-phrase min/man ‘who’ is moved from the object posi-
tion of the embedded clause. The embedded complementizer shows up in its
default form as ʔennu in Palestinian Arabic and ʔanna in Standard Arabic. By
contrast, in (21b) and (22b) the wh-phrase ʔanu bent/ʔayyu bintin ‘which girl’
is extracted from the embedded subject position. The sentences are, however,
unacceptable.7 The sentences improve if the embedded complementizer is fol-
lowed by an accusative clitic that resumes the wh-phrase in the matrix CP (21c)
and (22c). The contrast observed then is that the extraction of the object does not
force the resumption strategy but the extraction of the subject does. This asym-
metry parallels more familiar asymmetries about the extraction of subject and
objects in English and other languages. For example, in English it is easier to
extract an object across the complementizer that (23a) than a subject (23b).
(23)
a. Who do you think that Mary met?
b. *Who do you think that met Mary?
The standard account in the Principles and Parameters theory attributes the
contrast between the extraction of the object in (23a) and the extraction of the
7 The equivalent of (21b) and (22b) in Lebanese Arabic is acceptable.

56
The syntax of subjects
subject in (23b) to the ability of the verb to govern the object in (23a) and the
absence of such government in (23b). Given that government is deﬁned in terms
of c-command or M-command, it is clear that such relation obtains between the
verb and objects, which are within the VP, but not with the subject, which is
in the speciﬁer of TP. In short, the asymmetry between subjects and objects with
respect to their extractability is conﬁgurational in that it is sensitive to the structural
relation between the relevant argument and the verb.
Under the assumption that subject and object asymmetries are to be captured in
conﬁgurational terms, assuming the conﬁguration in (16) where both the subject
and the object are governed by the verb, the prediction is that, all else being equal,
there should be no contrast between extraction of subjects and objects, contrary
to what the facts in (21–22) show.
3.3.4
Binding asymmetries
Similar contrasts obtain in contexts of anaphor binding (Mohammad
2000). The assumption in the Principles and Parameters framework is that the
antecedent and the anaphor it binds must stand in an asymmetric relation, which,
in conﬁgurational terms, is stated in terms of c-command.
(24)
a. The student praised herself
b. *Herself praised the student
The unacceptability of (24b) is accounted for by the assumption that the antecedent
contained within the VP projection does not c-command the anaphor in the spec-
iﬁer of TP. By contrast, in (24a) the asymmetric c-command relation obtains.
Putting the irrelevant details aside, it can be said that the object and the subject
in (24a) are in an asymmetric relation, with the subject c-commanding the object.
This follows from the assumption that in addition to the major sentence constituent
TP, there is also a constituent containing the verb and the object, namely the VP.
With respect to anaphors in Arabic the facts can be easily tested in Standard
Arabic where Case is realized morphologically on the noun and where the verb
and the subject agree.8
(25)
Standard Arabic
a. mada¯ha
T-Taalib-u
nafs-a-hu
praised.3ms the-student-Nom self.f-Acc-his
‘The student praised himself.’
8 The anaphor nafs ‘self’ in Standard Arabic is feminine.

3.4 The status of preverbal subjects
57
b. *mada¯hat
nafs-u-hu
T-Taalib-a
praised.3fs self.f-Nom-his the-student-Acc
As illustrated in (25), the only context where binding between the subject and the
object can properly obtain is when the antecedent is in the subject position and
the anaphor is in the object position (25a).9 These facts can be straightforwardly
accounted for if the subject in Arabic is in an asymmetric relation with the object,
contrary to what is given in the conﬁguration in (16).
Summing up, there is strong evidence for a structure where the subject and
object are in an asymmetric relation and therefore for a VP constituent in Arabic.
The issue that we will deal with next concerns the position of the subject in the
clause structure.
3.4
The status of preverbal subjects
Several arguments have been advanced to argue that the preverbal subject
is not a genuine subject but rather a dislocated NP related to/binding a (resumptive)
pronominal. One argument is based on agreement asymmetries in Standard Arabic.
Another is based on the distribution of non-speciﬁc indeﬁnite subjects. We will
take up these arguments in turn and examine the evidence provided for them.
3.4.1
Agreement asymmetries and the position of the subject
In Standard Arabic, the verb and the subject agree, as shown in (26):
(26)
ʔakala
l-muʕallim-u
Standard Arabic
ate.3ms the-teacher.ms-Nom
‘The teacher ate.’
(27)
l-muʕallim-u
ʔakala
Standard Arabic
the-teacher.ms-Nom ate.3ms
‘The teacher ate.’
In (26) and (27) the same form of the verb is used regardless of whether the subject
is preverbal or postverbal, which at ﬁrst blush suggests that the verb always fully
9 The Moroccan Arabic equivalent of (25b) is also ungrammatical.
(i)
*məd¯hat
rasha
l-bənt
praised.3fs herself the-student.fs

58
The syntax of subjects
agrees with the subject in Standard Arabic. However, the situation becomes more
complex when we include plural subjects.
(28)
l-muʕallimuun
ʔakal-uu
Standard Arabic
the-teacher.mp.Nom ate-3mp
‘The teachers ate.’
(29)
*l-muʕallimuun
ʔakala
Standard Arabic
the-teacher.mp.Nom ate.3ms
As the examples in (28) and (29) illustrate, there is an agreement asymmetry
that is sensitive to the relative ordering of the subject and the verb in Standard
Arabic. When the subject precedes the verb, agreement is in number, person, and
gender. When the subject follows the verb, agreement is in person and gender
only. In particular, there is no morphological realization of number agreement.
This asymmetry becomes even more striking when we consider the morphology
of the imperfective, which differs from the perfective verb in being realized via
both preﬁxation and sufﬁxation, as the paradigms in (30a–b) show.

As is clear from the paradigm in (30b), agreement on the imperfective is realized
discontinuously. In most forms, the preﬁx carries person in addition to gender and
the sufﬁx carries number in addition to gender. What is striking is that when the
subject follows the verb the sufﬁx is absent, as shown in (31), but it is obligatorily
present if the subject precedes the verb (32).10
(31)
a. ta-drusu T-Taalibaat-u

‘The students study.’
b. ya-drusu T-Tullaab-u

‘The students study.’
b. T-Tullaab-u
ya-drus-uun
The-students.mp-Nom 3-study-mp
‘The students study.’
Arabic is also a null-subject language (family). Hence, in Standard Arabic and the
other dialects, the subject does not have to be overt:
(33)
a. ya-drus-uun
3-study-mp
‘They study.’
b. ya-drus-na
3-study-fp
‘They study.’
10 Note in (32a) that when the sufﬁx carries gender the preﬁx tends not to do so (see Noyer
1992).

60
The syntax of subjects
However, a null subject is only available in the context of full agreement. In the
context of partial agreement, i.e. when the number marker is absent, null plural
subjects are not possible. Hence the only viable interpretation in (34) is that where
the pronominal is singular.
(34)
a. ya-drusu
3-study
‘He studies.’
*‘They study.’
b. ta-drusu
3f-study
‘She studies.’
*‘They study.’
Building on the facts that there is an agreement asymmetry and that only full
agreement can license null pronominal subjects, it has been argued that the only
genuine agreement in Arabic is partial agreement and that full agreement indicates
the presence of a pronominal subject. This in turn implies that the preverbal subject
that co-occurs with agreement cannot be a subject, otherwise there would be two
subjects in the sentence, the lexical subject and the pronominal subject.
This analysis is problematic whether one assumes only one subject position in
the sentence (e.g. [Spec, TP]) or two subject positions ([Spec, VP] and [Spec,
TP]). Under the former assumption there is only one subject position available
and therefore either the preverbal NP or the pronominal related to it cannot be a
genuine subject. Since dislocated NPs in Arabic occur in the left periphery and can
bind resumptive pronouns, by analogy the preverbal subject can be treated as a left
dislocated element. Under the second assumption, positing two genuine subject
positions, one in [Spec, TP] and one in [Spec, VP], is equally problematic, and for
various reasons. First, there is only one thematic role for the external argument, yet
there are now two such arguments. Second, getting around the Thematic Criterion
problem by coindexing two subjects and assigning the thematic role to the chain
(Chomsky 1986) would yield a Principle B violation since the pronominal in
[Spec, VP] would be locally A-bound by the argument in [Spec, TP].11 Third, we
have to ensure that both subjects are Case licensed, which is problematic as well
because tense can usually Case license one subject only.
11 Principle B of the Binding Theory (Chomsky 1981) regulates the distribution of pro-
nouns. It mandates that they be free (unbound) in their local domain (governing category),
which usually coincides with the sentence or noun phrase particularly when the latter
has a subject.

3.4 The status of preverbal subjects
61
However, it is not sufﬁcient to deny the status of a genuine subject to the
preverbal NP on the basis of the agreement asymmetries. There are cases where
full agreement can be observed, though it is difﬁcult to argue that the NP is
clitic-left dislocated. Such a situation arises in the context of auxiliary verbs:
(35)
a. kaanat
T-Taalibaat-u
ya-drus-na
be.past.3fs the-students.fp-Nom 3-study-fp
‘The students were studying.’
b. T-Taalibaat-u
kunna
ya-drus-na
the-students.fp-Nom be.past.3fp 3-study-fp
‘The students were studying.’
Under standard analyses both the auxiliary verb and the main verb are in the
same clause. Thus, the NP between the auxiliary verb and the main verb in (35a)
must be a subject rather than a clitic-left dislocated NP (see chapter 8 for further
discussion on clitic-left dislocation in Arabic). Yet the verb that follows it carries
full agreement and the verb that precedes it carries partial agreement, as the
contrast between (35) and (36) illustrates.
(36)
a. *kunna
T-Taalibaat-u
ya-drus-na
be.past.3fp the-student.fp-Nom 3-study-fp
‘The students were studying.’
b. *T-Taalibaat-u
kaanat
ya-drus-na
the-student.fp-Nom be.past-3fs 3-study-fp
‘The students were studying.’
In addition, if the subject is not lexical both the auxiliary verb and the main verb
must have full agreement, as illustrated in (37).
(37)
a. kunna
ya-drus-na
be.past.3fp 3-study-fp
‘They were studying.’
b. *kaanat
ya-drus-na
be.past.3fs 3-study-fp
If (37a) is given a monoclausal analysis and if full agreement indicates the
presence of null pronouns as arguments of the verb, then we are forced to
posit two arguments for the sentence in (37a), which leads into the problems
mentioned earlier with the Thematic Criterion, Binding Principle B, and Case
assignment.

62
The syntax of subjects
In sum, full agreement does not seem to provide conclusive evidence against
treating the preverbal NP as a genuine subject.
3.4.2
Indeﬁnite subjects
While deﬁnite NP subjects in most Arabic dialects, including Standard
Arabic, can occur in both preverbal and postverbal position, indeﬁnite subjects
have a more restricted distribution. As is the case in other languages, indeﬁnite
NP subjects in Arabic are not allowed in the preverbal position. This seems to
be the case in Standard Arabic (Ayoub 1981), as well as other Arabic dialects
like Palestinian Arabic (Mohammad 2000), Moroccan Arabic, and Lebanese
Arabic.
(38)

b. *walad ʔəˇza

3.4 The status of preverbal subjects
63
In some Arabic dialects, a modiﬁed indeﬁnite NP subject seems to be allowed
in the preverbal position, as shown by the acceptability of the following sentences
from Palestinian Arabic (Mohammad 2000).
(42)
a. walad Tawiil ʔadˇza
boy
tall
came.past.3ms
‘A tall boy came.’
b. zalame dactoor ʔadˇza
man
doctor
came.past.3ms
‘A man (who is) a physician came.’
Similarly, if the indeﬁnite NP subject in Palestinian Arabic is in the Construct
State, it can occur in the preverbal position.
(43)
ʔiben dactoor ʔadˇza
son
doctor
came.past.3ms
‘A son of a doctor came.’
Those facts seem to indicate that the more speciﬁc the subject is the more
freedom it has to occur in either the preverbal or postverbal position. It is not
clear what to make of these data as far as the status of the preverbal position
is concerned. Clearly, not all the “speciﬁc” indeﬁnites function as topics in the
sentences above, and therefore it cannot be said that the preverbal position is a
topic position rather than a subject position. Moreover, there are NPs that do not
seem to be speciﬁc and can still occur in the preverbal position. This is the case
with negative polarity items (NPIs) in the various Arabic dialects. Benmamoun
(1996) discusses the contrast between two types of negative polarity subjects in
Moroccan Arabic: NPs headed by the particle ¯hətta and the bare NPI ¯hədd.12
(44)
a. ma-ˇza
¯hətta wa¯həd
Neg-came.past.3ms even one
‘No one came.’
b. ma-ˇza
¯hədd
Neg-came.past.3ms no one
‘No one came.’
Interestingly, only NPIs headed by ¯hətta can occur in the preverbal position (45a);
NPIs headed by ¯hədd are restricted to the postverbal position.
12 We leave open the question of whether it is accurate to characterize both elements as
NPIs. It may turn out that one is an NPI and the other is a negative quantiﬁer. For the
present purposes, the main relevant characterization is that they are both indeﬁnite.

64
The syntax of subjects
(45)
a. ¯hətta wa¯həd ma-ˇza
even one
Neg-came.past.3ms
‘No one came.’
b. *¯hədd ma-ˇza
no one Neg-came.past.3ms
Benmamoun (1996) argues that the reason why (45a) is grammatical is because the
NPI ¯hətta is a presuppositional particle which can occur in the preverbal position.
Moreover, NPIs headed by ¯hətta can be clitic-left dislocated, as evidenced by the
presence of the pronominal clitic within the sentence in (46).
(46)
¯hətta ktab ma-qrit-u
even book Neg-read.past.3ms-it
‘I didn’t read any book.’
These data indicate that the preverbal position has a more restricted distribution
than the postverbal subject position. However, it does not seem to always function
as a clitic-left dislocated element either, which casts doubt on the analysis of the
preverbal subject as a dislocated element.
3.4.3
Broad vs. narrow subjects
The question that can be raised at this point is whether the preverbal
NP can still accurately be called a subject. Doron and Heycock (1999) provide a
compromise answer to this question. They argue that many languages, including
Arabic, have multiple subjects or NPs in the Nominative Case (hence pattern with
subjects) that bind resumptive pronouns. This is illustrated by the sentences in
(47) from Standard Arabic:
(47)
a. hind-un
yuqaabilu-ha
T-Tullaab-u
Hind-Nom meet.3ms-her the-students-Nom
‘The students are meeting Hind.’
Literally: ‘Hind, the students are meeting her.’
b. ʔal-bayt-u
ʔalwaan-u-hu
zaahiyat-un
the-house-Nom colors-Nom-its bright-Nom
‘The house has bright colors.’
Literally: ‘The house, its colors are bright.’
Doron and Heycock argue that the preverbal NP in (47a) and the two nominative
noun phrases that precede the predicate adjective in (47b) are subjects rather

3.4 The status of preverbal subjects
65
than dislocated noun phrases, with the whole clause, which may also contain a
subject, as predicate. They further distinguish between broad subjects and narrow
subjects. In (47a) hindun is a broad subject while ʔalwaan-u-hu ‘its colors’ in
(47b) is a narrow subject. Narrow subjects can precede or follow the predicate
but broad subjects always precede the predicate. In fact, broad subjects precede
narrow subjects when those occur before the predicate. One argument Doron and
Heycock provide for treating some NPs as broad subjects is based on the so-called
exceptional Case marking. In Arabic, the so-called broad subject can be marked
with Accusative Case by a matrix verb, which is presumably not allowed for
genuine left dislocated NPs.

zaahiyat-un
thought-1s the-house-Acc colors-Nom-its bright-Nom
‘I believe the house to be of bright colors.’
Moreover, the broad subject can follow the auxiliary verb kaan, as illustrated
in (49).
(49)
kaana
l-bayt-u
ʔalwaan-u-hu
zaahiyat-un
was.3ms the-house-Nom colors-its-Nom bright-Nom
‘The house was of bright colors.’
It is partly for these reasons that Doron and Heycock stress that elements like l-
bayt-a ‘the house’ in (48) and l-baytu ‘the house’ in (49) are subjects. Syntactically,
the broad subject occupies the same position as the narrow subject occurring before
the predicate, namely [Spec, TP].13 The crucial difference between narrow and
broad subjects is that the latter are directly merged (base-generated) in [Spec, TP]
while narrow subjects move to [Spec, TP] to derive the SV order.14 However, as
we will discuss in the next section, even the status of the postverbal subject is not
clear.15
13 Thus Doron and Heycock cast their analysis in a theory that allows multiple speciﬁers
to be projected for a given head.
14 Doron and Heycock assume that postverbal narrow subjects occur in [Spec, VP] and
that partial agreement in the VS order is weak while full agreement is strong and thus
forces subject movement from the VP to TP.
15 It is not clear how the broad subject, if indeed a subject, gets its Case given that it is
base-generated in its surface position, namely Spec TP. The only solution would be to
allow tense or whatever functional element involved in Nominative Case assignment
to enter into more than one Case relation. This is not a straightforward assumption,
however.

3.5
The status of postverbal subjects
The idea that the thematic subject is generated in [Spec, VP] has provided
a straightforward way to derive the VSO order in Standard Arabic and the modern
dialects (Koopman and Sportiche 1991). According to Mohammad (1989, 2000),
Benmamoun (1992a), and Fassi Fehri (1993), if we assume that the subject in (50)
is in [Spec, VP], the VSO order can be derived by moving the verb to T, leaving
the subject in its base position as illustrated in (51):
(50)
naama
T-Tiﬂu
Standard Arabic
slept.3ms the-child
‘The child slept.’
(51)
IP
Spec 
 I
VP
I
naamai
Spec 
V 
T-Tiflu 
V
ti 
'
'
This seems to be an improvement over an analysis that takes the VSO order to
involve verb movement to C, since the complementizer can co-occur with the VSO
order, as shown in the following sentences:
(52)
a. tanDənn bəlli ˇza
ʕomar
Moroccan Arabic
think.1s that came.3ms Omar
‘I think that Omar came.’
b. biftikir
ʔənno ʔiˇza
saami
Lebanese Arabic
think.1s that
came.3ms Sami
‘I think that Sami came.’
However, there are reasons to maintain that the postverbal subject is not within
the VP. Two pieces of evidence can be adduced to support the analysis that the
VSO order does not necessarily entail that the subject is in the Spec of VP.16
16 This is a weaker stance than saying that the postverbal subject is always outside the
lexical projection.

3.5 The status of postverbal subjects
67
3.5.1
Copular sentences in Moroccan Arabic
The ﬁrst argument comes from the distribution of sentential negation
in the context of copular constructions. Sentential negation in Moroccan Arabic
consists of two morphemes, the pro-clitic ma and the enclitic ˇs. If they attach to a
verb, ma occurs as a preﬁx and ˇs as a sufﬁx (53):
(53)
ʕomar ma-qra-ˇs
lə-ktab
Omar Neg-read.3ms-Neg the-book
‘Omar did not read the book.’
In Benmamoun (1992a), ma is posited as head of the negative projection located
between TP and VP while ˇs is analyzed as an adjunct to the VP, which accounts
for the distribution of the negative elements with respect to the verbal head. Verb
movement to T in Moroccan Arabic proceeds through the negative projection.
(54)
T 
TP 
T 
Spec 
NegP 
 Neg

'
In copular sentences with present tense interpretation, the so-called verbless sen-
tences, ma merges with ˇs:
(55)
a. ʕomar ma-ˇsi
f-d-dar
Omar Neg-Neg in-the-house
‘Omar is not in the house.’
b. ʕomar ma-ˇsi
kaddab
Omar Neg-Neg liar
‘Omar is not a liar.’
c. ʕomar ma-ˇsi
mriD
Omar Neg-Neg sick
‘Omar is not sick.’
This merger is not possible when there is a verb in the sentence:

68
The syntax of subjects
(56)
a. *ʕomar ma-ˇsi
qra
lə-ktab
Omar
Neg-Neg read.3ms the-book
b. *ʕomar qra
ma-ˇsi
lə-ktab
Omar
read.3ms Neg-Neg the-book
Example (56a) is ruled out because obligatory verb movement to T has not taken
place. On the other hand, (56b) is ill-formed because the movement of the verb
to T violates Relativized Minimality or the Head Movement Constraint (HMC):
on its way to T, V has “skipped” the negative head. By contrast, in (55) the two
negative elements merge since there is no verb in the sentence and therefore no
head that would occur between them.17
With this brief background in mind, let us consider the distribution of the
sentential subject. In sentences with a verbal head, the subject can either follow
or precede the verb:
(57)
a. ʕomar ma-qra-ˇs
lə-ktab
Omar Neg-read.3ms-Neg the-book
‘Omar did not read the book.’
b. ma-qra-ˇs
ʕomar lə-ktab
Neg-read.3ms-Neg Omar the-book
‘Omar did not read the book.’
Example (57a) follows straightforwardly if the subject is in [Spec, TP] and the
verb, together with sentential negation, is in T. Turning to (57b), if the verb is in T
then the natural assumption is that the subject must be in [Spec, VP], which is the
analysis that has been provided for these constructions.18 However, this analysis
of the VSO order makes one prediction, namely that in copular constructions
where there is no overt verbal head (such as in (55)), the subject can either precede
or follow sentential negation. This prediction is not borne out. The subject must
always precede sentential negation:
(58)
a. ʕomar ma-ˇsi
mriD
Omar Neg-Neg sick
‘Omar is not sick.’
b. *ma-ˇsi
ʕomar mriD
Neg-Neg Omar sick
17 In chapter 5 we discuss the syntax of sentential negation in greater detail, so we will
conﬁne our attention in this section to the aspects of the constructions that are relevant
to the issue of the syntactic position of the postverbal subject.
18 This raises the thorny issue of “optional” movement which we will put aside.

3.5 The status of postverbal subjects
69
Consider the derivation of (58a). The underlying representation is as in (59):
(59)
TP 
Spec 
T
T
NegP
Neg
ma
 
AP  
 
AP 
Spec 
A 
omar
'
The NP ʕomar is generated in [Spec, AP] where it gets its thematic role. Assuming
that movement to [Spec, TP] is optional, the subject can remain in [Spec, AP].
Since there is no head movement, ma merges with ˇs. However, this analysis
wrongly predicts (58b) to be well-formed, given that the movement of the subject
to [Spec, TP] does not take place. This problem disappears if we give up the
assumption that the VSO order always implies that the subject is in the speciﬁer
of the lexical projection where it gets its thematic role. Suppose that the subject
must move to [Spec, TP] overtly. In standard minimalist analyses, this is due to the
EPP. Then, (58b) is ruled out because the subject has not moved overtly to [Spec,
TP]. If this is correct, the VSO order would still involve overt subject movement to
[Spec, TP] with additional overt verb movement beyond TP (Aoun, Benmamoun,
and Sportiche 1994).19 This conclusion gains further support from word order in
the context of existential constructions discussed in the next section.
3.5.2
Existential constructions
The second piece of evidence that the VSO order does not always entail
that the subject is in the speciﬁer of the lexical projection where it is assigned a
semantic role comes from existential constructions in Standard Arabic.
19 This means that it is not the movement of the subject that is optional but rather that of
the verb. It is not clear what forces this movement. It is plausible that verb movement
to the projection above IP is always obligatory. What is optional is the movement of the
subject to the Spec of that projection.

70
The syntax of subjects
As in English, the Arabic existential construction involves the locative pro-form
hunaaka ‘there’ and an indeﬁnite NP marked with Nominative Case, as illustrated
in (60):
(60)
hunaaka Taalib-un
ﬁi l-¯hadiiqati
there
student-Nom in the-garden
‘There is a student in the garden.’
Most analyses of the equivalent construction in English assume that the indeﬁnite
NP is in the speciﬁer of the lexical projection, i.e. PP in (60), and the expletive is
in [Spec, TP]:20
(61)
TP 
Spec 
 T
hunaaka  T
 
 
PP       
DP 
 
P  
Taalibun 
P
DP
 
fii 
l- adiiqati 
'
'
Now consider the sentence in (60) with an overt auxiliary:
(62)
kaana
hunaaka Taalib-un
ﬁi l-¯hadiiqati
was.3ms there
student-Nom in the-garden
‘There was a student in the garden.’
In (62) the expletive follows the auxiliary verb. That sentence receives a straight-
forward analysis if we assume that the expletive is in [Spec, TP] and the lexical
NP is in [Spec, PP]. This shows clearly that the VSO order does not entail that the
subject is within the thematic projection. It does, however, show that in the VSO
order the verb is in a position higher than TP, a projection we neutrally call FP in
(63):
20 We will ignore the important problem of how the indeﬁnite subject checks its case
features. Obviously if the thematic subject is in [Spec, PP], obligatory movement to
[Spec, TP] must be due to the EPP, a requirement that is satisﬁed by the expletive.

However, FP is not the familiar CP projection because the sentence in (62) can
be embedded under a complementizer, as illustrated in (64):
(64)

hunaaka Taalib-un
ﬁi l-¯hadiiqati
heard.1s that-it
was.3ms there
student-Nom in the-garden
‘I heard that there was a student in the garden.’
While it is not clear at this point what the nature of FP is, the word order facts
from existential constructions lead to the reasonable conclusion that the postverbal
subject is not necessarily in the speciﬁer of the projection of the thematic predi-
cate. Since the expletive can also occur in the postverbal position, the postverbal
subject position must be within a functional projection above the lexical thematic
projection.
The conclusion that emerges from the above discussion is that the postverbal
subject position is not within the lexical projection of the main predicate but rather
in a functional projection that can be identiﬁed as TP. This leaves us with a puzzle:
if the postverbal subject is likely to be in [Spec, TP], then what explains the SV
order?
3.6
Conclusion
There is a consensus that the so-called postverbal subject is a genuine
subject in Arabic dialects. It is not clear, however, whether it is overtly within
the projection of the thematic predicate or whether it is within the functional

72
The syntax of subjects
projection of tense, i.e. TP. The fact that expletive subjects can occur in the
postverbal position seems to support the latter view. With respect to the so-called
preverbal subject, there is no consensus as to whether it should be treated as a
subject. The fact that it is restricted semantically to deﬁnite and modiﬁed indeﬁnite
NPs and that they co-occur with full agreement seems to support the view that
they are left dislocated or topicalized elements that bind resumptive pronouns.
However, there are also arguments that indicate that this is not the case because
they do not, according to Doron and Heycock (1999), always display properties of
clitic-left dislocated NPs (see also chapter 8). The issue remains unresolved partly
because the notion of subject itself is not conceptually well deﬁned given that the
traditional conﬁgurational notion of subject has become increasingly vague due to
the assumptions that more than one position in the sentence can host the element
usually labeled as subject.

Sentential agreement

Introduction
Arabic dialects have a rich system of subject–verb agreement.1 A verb
may agree with the subject in person, number, and gender. Standard Arabic (1)
has the richest subject agreement paradigms. Thus, unlike in the modern dialects,
the verb may display dual agreement in addition to singular and plural agreement.
The modern dialects paradigms also differ from each other. Some, like Moroccan
Arabic (2), do not display gender distinctions in the second person singular forms,
while others, like Lebanese Arabic (3), display such distinctions.

The agreement paradigms in (1–3) occur on the so-called perfective verb. As
mentioned in chapters 1 and 2, in the perfective, subject agreement is realized as a
sufﬁx on the verb. In the imperfective, by contrast, the realization of agreement is
radically different. It is realized by both preﬁxes and sufﬁxes, as illustrated from
Standard Arabic (4), Moroccan Arabic (5), and Lebanese Arabic (6).

In addition to the status of the subject in the SVO order no other issue has seen
as much extensive debate as the issue of subject–verb agreement. Some of the
main issues that have dominated the debate have revolved around the agreement
asymmetry that Standard Arabic displays, which in turn relates to the issues of
the status of the agreement morpheme, the structural conditions on agreement,
and the status of the so-called preverbal subject. Another issue that gained a lot of
attention in the last decade or so concerns another agreement asymmetry, namely
the phenomenon of ﬁrst conjunct agreement. We will start with the agreement
asymmetry in Standard Arabic and then turn to ﬁrst conjunct agreement. We will
also brieﬂy discuss agreement in the context of existential constructions at the end
of the chapter.
4.2
Subject–verb agreement asymmetry in Standard Arabic
As is well known there is an agreement asymmetry in Standard Arabic
that is sensitive to word order: in the VS order, with the subject following the verb,

76
Sentential agreement
agreement between the verb and the subject is in gender, and perhaps person,
only.2
(7)
Standard Arabic
a. ʔakala
l-muʕallim-uun
ate.3ms the-teacher-mp.Nom
‘The teachers ate.’
b. *ʔakal-uu l-muʕallim-uun
ate-3mp
the-teacher-mp.Nom
On the other hand, in the SV order, with the subject preceding the verb, the verb
fully agrees with the subject, as shown by the presence of number in addition to
gender, and perhaps person.
(8)
Standard Arabic
a. l-muʕallim-uun
ʔakal-uu
the-teacher-mp.Nom ate-3mp
‘The teachers ate.’
b. *l-muʕallim-uun
ʔakala
the-teacher-mp-Nom ate.3ms
There are at least three possible candidates for what is responsible for the agree-
ment asymmetry in Standard Arabic: (i) in the VSO order there is a null expletive
subject that is forcing agreement with the verb, hence there is actually no agree-
ment asymmetry; (ii) full agreement on the verb is an incorporated pronominal,
hence there is no agreement asymmetry because there is no subject–verb agree-
ment, particularly in number; (iii) there is always full agreement between the verb
and the subject but agreement features may be spelled-out/realized differently (in
the post-syntactic morphological component which is referred to in the Principles
and Parameters framework as PF), by a morpheme or by merger with the lexical
subject. We will take up these analyses in order.
4.2.1
Expletive subject and poor agreement
Suppose that we assume that the structure of sentences such as (7a) is
as in (9), with the subject in a lower projection, say the VP (Fassi Fehri 1993;
Mohammad 2000).
2 There is no consensus as to whether there is agreement in person in addition to gender
under the VS order; see Fassi Fehri (1993) and Mohammad (2000) for discussion.

The verb raises from the VP to T while the subject remains lower. The Spec of
TP is occupied by an expletive subject, which is null in (7a) but can be overt as in
(10a, b) from Mohammad (2000:92–93).3
(10)
a. ʔa-huwa musta¯hiil-un

ʔan nattaﬁq-a
yawm-an
claimed.1s that-he/it impossible-Nom that agree.1p-subj day-Acc
‘I claimed that it is impossible for us to ever agree.’
Note that the expletive is nominative, huwa ‘he/it’ in (10a), but accusative, -hu
in (10b). This is as expected given that it is preceded by the complementizer
ʔanna, which assigns Accusative Case to the NP that follows it (see chapter 2).
Mohammad (2000) takes sentences such as (10b) as strong evidence for locating
the expletive subject in Spec TP. Putting aside the issue of what forces the presence
of the expletive in such contexts, the question is whether the expletive enters into
an agreement relation with the verb which in turn could help account for the
agreement asymmetry.
The main challenge for this account is partial agreement. It is not clear how
in (7a) the verb agrees with the subject in gender if agreement is indeed with an
expletive. The only alternative would be to ﬁnd a way to allow number agreement
with the putative expletive and gender (and probably person) agreement with the
lexical postverbal subject. One option is that partial agreement does not reﬂect a
syntactically grounded agreement relation but may be accidental. Ouhalla (1994a)
attributes it to the fact that the subject is linearly adjacent to the verb at PF. This
3 See also Fassi Fehri (1993) for detailed discussion of the expletive in Arabic.

78
Sentential agreement
last option should not be automatically discounted, but it needs to explain why
this cannot also be the case when the subject precedes the verb.
4.2.2
Full agreement as an incorporated pronoun
It is tempting to take the complementary distribution between full agree-
ment and the postverbal subject to indicate that full agreement is a realization of
a pronominal that gets incorporated into the verb (Fassi Fehri 1993, 2000). This
analysis explains why a postverbal subject cannot co-occur with full agreement.
Under this analysis, full agreement, which is an incorporated subject pronoun,
and the postverbal lexical subject compete for the same syntactic position and the
semantic role associated with it.
There are at least three sets of facts that challenge the incorporation account.
The ﬁrst set of facts comes from preverbal lexical subjects, which co-occur with
full agreement on the verb (8a). Under the incorporation account of full agree-
ment, the preverbal NP cannot be a subject but rather a left dislocated element
with the full agreement morpheme playing the role of the resumptive pronoun.
This is a reasonable alternative that has been adopted by a number of students
of Arabic (see chapter 3). However, there are contexts where it is not clear
that the preverbal NP can be analyzed as a left dislocated element. These are
cases where the subject is located between the main verb and an auxiliary verb
(11a).
(11)
a. kaanat
T-Taalibaat-u
ya-drus-na
be.past.3fs the-student.fp-Nom 3-study-fp
‘The students were studying.’
b. T-Taalibaat-u
kunna
ya-drus-na
the-student.fp-Nom be.past.3fp 3-study-fp
‘The students were studying.’
As illustrated in (11a) the NP T-Taalibaat-u ‘the students’ precedes the main verb
ya-drus-na ‘study’ and follows the auxiliary verb kaanat ‘was.’ The lexical verb is
in the plural and the auxiliary is in the singular. The position of the NP T-Taalibaat-
u ‘the students’ is not a position that has generally been associated with left
dislocated elements (see chapter 8). It is rather a position that has been associated
with regular NP subjects. Moreover, the fact that the auxiliary verb displays partial
agreement clearly indicates that the NP T-Taalibaat-u ‘the students’ is a subject
with respect to that verb. However, the main verb ya-drus-na ‘study’ displays
full agreement, which under the incorporation account means that the subject is
actually an incorporated pronominal. Thus, we end up with two subjects in the

4.2 Subject–verb agreement asymmetry in Standard Arabic
79
same sentence, exactly the situation that the incorporation account is set up to rule
out.
The second set of facts comes from wh-movement contexts, particularly rela-
tive clauses. In Standard Arabic, a relativized object can leave a gap within the
sentence:
(12)
ʔiˇstaraytu l-kitaaba llaδii katabta
bought.1s the-book that
wrote.2ms
‘I bought the book that you wrote.’
Interestingly, when the subject is relativized, full agreement on the verb is oblig-
atory, as illustrated in (13).
(13)
raʔaytu l-kuttaaba
llaδiina zaar-uu
l-ˇzaamiʕata
saw.1s the-authors who.mp visited-3mp the-university
‘I saw the authors who visited the university.’
Under the incorporation account, the full agreement on the verb within the relative
clause indicates the presence of a pronominal subject. This in turn implies that
relativization of the subject obligatorily deploys the resumptive pronoun strategy.
However, it is not clear why this should be the case only in the context of subject
relativization, particularly if the relativized object, as seen in (12) is extracted from
the postverbal position, which is also the canonical position of the subject under
the incorporation account. Postverbal positions are usually considered privileged
positions as launching sites for displacement. Barring an independent explanation
for why the putative resumptive strategy is only obligatory in the context of subject
relativization, the facts in (13) remain a challenge for the incorporation account
of full agreement.
The third set of facts that challenge the incorporation account of full agreement
comes from the nature of the subject agreement morpheme. As shown above, in
the perfective all the features of subject agreement are realized by a sufﬁx on
the verb. However, in the context of the imperfective verb, agreement is realized
discontinuously, with person as preﬁx and number as sufﬁx. It is not at all clear
how this situation could be handled under an incorporation account since in most
such cases all the features are spelled-out by one continuous phonological unit,
since this is how pronouns are usually realized. In the present context, we would
need to ﬁnd a way to split the incorporated pronoun so that one part is realized as
a preﬁx and one part as a sufﬁx. While this is not implausible, and such analyses
have been proposed, the question is whether such a complex analysis is warranted.
In addition to the empirical problems raised against the incorporation account of
full agreement, there is also a conceptual problem that arises. Under this account,
there are two agreement paradigms in Arabic. One agreement paradigm realizes

80
Sentential agreement
partial agreement and another agreement paradigm realizes a full incorporated
pronoun. Now, consider agreement in the context of a singular subject in both the
VS and SV order.

Notice that in both the perfective and imperfective verbs, the agreement mor-
pheme is the same in both VS and SV order. According to the incorporation
account, agreement is a pronominal in SV but a genuine agreement morpheme
in VS since there is already a subject in the postverbal position. Under such an
account, the fact that the two paradigms are identical is accidental.
4.2.3
Syntactic analyses of agreement asymmetry
There have been various syntactic approaches to account for the asym-
metry in the context of subject–verb agreement in Standard Arabic. Though the

4.2 Subject–verb agreement asymmetry in Standard Arabic
81
approaches differ from each other, their main assumption is that the asymmetry
can be explained in syntactic terms. We will discuss two approaches and their
challenges. The ﬁrst approach, ﬁrst proposed in Benmamoun (1992a, b) and also
explored by Bahloul and Harbert (1993), tries to capitalize on the surface conﬁg-
urational relation between the verb and the subject in the VS and SV orders.
Let’s start with the VS order. Assuming the conﬁguration in (16) for that order,
notice that the verb governs the subject in [Spec, VP].

Turning to the SV order and assuming the conﬁguration in (17), the verb and
the subject in TP are both in a Spec-Head relation.

Given the conﬁgurations in (16) and (17), the agreement asymmetry seems to be
sensitive to the conﬁgurational relation between the verb and the subject: the verb
is in a government relation with the subject in (16) and in a Spec-Head relation

82
Sentential agreement
with the subject in (17). Partial agreement seems to obtain under government and
full agreement under Spec-Head agreement.
However, this account has its shortcomings. Notice that the verb and the subject
are underlyingly in a Spec-Head relation (within the VP, as indicated in (16))
before verb movement occurs. Moreover, we saw in chapter 2 that in the VS order
the subject may not actually be in the VP but in a higher projection, probably TP.
Therefore, the subject and the verb are in a Spec-Head conﬁguration at several
points in the derivation regardless of the ﬁnal surface order (Aoun, Benmamoun
and Sportiche 1994). They are also in a government relation. Consequently, one
would expect either partial or full agreement throughout. Conceptually, this analy-
sis is suspect because it needs to rely on a disjunction using two separate conﬁgura-
tions, the Spec-Head conﬁguration, which is generally grounded in the X′-schema,
and the government conﬁguration which is not so grounded.
The second syntactic approach to asymmetric agreement overcomes this con-
ceptual problem by assuming that only one conﬁguration is relevant to agreement,
namely the Spec-Head conﬁguration. This relation can obtain overtly or covertly
(in the component that deals with the interface between form and meaning, which
is referred to in the Principles and Parameters framework as Logical Form or LF).
If it obtains overtly, as it does in the SV order, full agreement takes place and is
realized overtly. On the other hand, if the Spec-Head relation obtains covertly, for
example due to covert raising of the subject, only partial agreement takes place.
One version of such an analysis is provided by van Gelderen (1996). She suggests
a syntactic solution to account for the difference between number and gender.
She makes a number of assumptions that are crucial to her analysis. First, she
assumes, following earlier work of Mohammad (1989), that there is an expletive
subject in the VSO order that could possibly be null. Second, the expletive is
speciﬁed for number but crucially not gender. Third, she assumes that number is a
verbal feature that is strong and gender is a verbal feature that is weak. Fourth, she
follows the earlier minimalist assumptions of Chomsky (1995), by maintaining
that weak features do not require overt movement but strong features do. Fifth,
the verb is also speciﬁed for nominal [+N] features that are always strong and
hence require overt verb movement. Given these ﬁve assumptions, van Gelderen
explains the presence of gender agreement under the VS order as follows: the
verb always moves, presumably to T, where the (null) expletive is located. The
verbal number feature is strong and the expletive checks it ﬁrst before the putative
LF movement of the subject takes place. With respect to gender, van Gelderen
claims that since the feature is weak it does not need to be checked overtly but
rather covertly, subsequent to the LF movement of the subject. By the end of the
derivation, the verb has been through two agreement relations, with the expletive
subject (number agreement) and the lexical subject (gender agreement).

4.2 Subject–verb agreement asymmetry in Standard Arabic
83
Notice, however, that under this analysis a weak feature, such as gender, does
not need to be overtly checked to be spelled-out in the morphology. This may
not be a serious problem but it comes at a cost, namely that the subject does
raise covertly, an assumption that does not seem to be independently motivated.
In addition, it is not at all obvious why gender agreement on the verb, a non-
interpretable feature in the sense of Chomsky (1995), should be present at LF and
relevant to LF computations. Moreover, van Gelderen’s analysis relies crucially
on the assumption that the lexical subject remains within the VP, which conﬂicts
with recent analyses that show that the subject is higher than VP in a position
where it can itself play a role in number agreement overtly (see chapter 3).
In short, all the accounts discussed so far fall short of accounting for all the
agreement facts in Arabic while remaining empirically and conceptually consis-
tent. In the next section we will look at the latest alternative, where the main
argument is that the asymmetry is inherently morphological rather than syntactic.
4.2.4
Morphological analysis of the agreement asymmetry
Rather than maintaining the core assumption that the asymmetry is fun-
damentally syntactic, Benmamoun (2000) argues that the asymmetry is morpho-
logical and is due to how the number feature is spelled-out in the morphology.
This analysis builds on the analysis of Aoun, Benmamoun and Sportiche (1994).
Those authors argue that there is only one agreement relation, the Spec-Head rela-
tion, between the verb and the subject, which obtains overtly. However, due to the
placement of the verb higher than the subject (due to movement perhaps), the verb
may lose its number feature. Benmamoun (2000) argues that the reason why the
number morpheme does not surface in the VS order is because, in the morphology,
the verb and the postverbal subject form a prosodic unit, which in turn makes the
lexical subject an exponent of the number feature on the verb. Consequently, the
presence of the number afﬁx becomes redundant. The merger between the verb
and the subject to form a prosodic unit obtains, post-syntactically, in the compo-
nent that spells-out the terminal elements of the syntactic phrase marker and their
features.
Benmamoun (2000) provides several arguments for this analysis. First, it
explains the agreement situation that arises in the context where the subject is
located between the auxiliary verb and the main verb: since the subject merges
with the auxiliary verb to form a prosodic unit, the prediction is that it is this
verb that will not display the number morpheme. The main verb, by contrast, will.
Second, since the absence of number is contingent on merger with a postverbal
lexical subject, the analysis makes the correct prediction that in the context of
relativization, and whenever the postverbal subject is empty, the verb will display

84
Sentential agreement
the number afﬁx. Third, this analysis makes the VS order parallel to the Construct
State in the context of noun phrases, where the argument for a prosodic merger
between the Construct State members is better grounded.4
However, despite the fact that it does avoid the pitfalls of the purely syntactic
accounts, the morphological analysis has its shortcomings. First, it must stipulate
that the merger between the subject and the verb can only obtain in the VS order.
This issue is discussed in Ackema and Neeleman (2003) and Benmamoun and
Lorimor (2006) and seems to be part of a general tendency, particularly in head
initial languages, but at this point it remains a stipulation. Second, unlike the
Construct State, where the members cannot be so easily separated, the verb and
the subject can be separated by NP objects and other constituents, as illustrated
in (18).
(18)
kataba
r-risaalat-a
l-ʔawlaad-u
wrote.3ms the-letter-Acc the-children
‘The children wrote the letter.’
A possible account for such facts is that both the subject and the object form a
prosodic unit with the verb. This is not implausible but additional work needs to
be done to determine whether they do form such a unit (see footnote 4).
Third, as is well known, in the modern Arabic dialects full agreement obtains
regardless of word order.

4 Benmamoun (2003) provides a historical explanation for the parallelism between sen-
tences and Construct State noun phrases and for its correlation with the absence of number
on the verb and (in-)deﬁniteness marker on all but the last members of the Construct State.
He then argues the VS order has gradually lost its Construct State status, leading up to the
situation in the modern dialects where agreement is full regardless of word order. Under
such a scenario the asymmetry in Standard Arabic survives from a stage where the verb
and the postverbal subject were strictly adjacent.

85
b. l-wleed
neem-o

All the above analyses, whether syntactic or morphological, need to make
additional assumptions to deal with agreement in the modern dialects. Under
the morphological account, the claim is straightforward, namely that there is no
merger between the verb and the subject. But that raises the question of whether
there is independent evidence for such merger and why such merger is absent in
all the modern dialects.
4.3
First conjunct agreement in the Modern Arabic dialects
Another intriguing agreement phenomenon that has been prominently
debated is the phenomenon of ﬁrst conjunct agreement (FCA). FCA, illustrated
in (21a) and (22a), from Moroccan Arabic and Lebanese Arabic respectively,
involves a coordinated subject whose lefthand member agrees with the verb. Full
agreement with the postverbal coordinated subject is also an option, as illustrated
in (21d) and (22d). On the other hand, a preverbal coordinated subject does not
display FCA, as shown in (21c) and (22c) (in contrast with (21b) and (22b)
respectively)

The main topic of contention has been whether FCA agreement, which arises
under the VS order, is due to a biclausal structure of the conjunction or to some
syntactic property that allows the verb to target the lefthand member of a conjoined
NP. Aoun, Benmamoun and Sportiche (1994, 1999), and Aoun and Benmamoun
(1999) take up this issue in detail and argue for a biclausal analysis. The main
evidence comes from the fact that FCA is not compatible with verbs that require
plural subjects, as illustrated in (24–29).

Similar facts obtain in the context of particles that require a plural subject within
the same clause. These particles can be quantiﬁers (30–33) that modify the verb
or the subject, or reciprocals (34–35) and reﬂexives (36), which require a local
binder within the same clausal domain.

Finally, control structures (37–38) also resist FCA. This is also because oblig-
atory control requires an anaphoric-like relation between the controller and the
controlled. In particular, split antecedents are usually not allowed, a situation that
would arise under the biclausal analysis of FCA.

All the above facts are compatible with a clausal coordination account of FCA,
i.e. each NP is the subject of its own clause while the second clausal conjunct
contains a gapped verb.5
4.4
First conjunct agreement in Standard Arabic
At ﬁrst blush, the facts from Standard Arabic present direct counter-
arguments to the biclausal analysis of FCA in the modern Arabic dialects. It
appears that, unlike in the other dialects of Arabic, in Standard Arabic, FCA can
occur in the context of predicates and elements that require a plural subject in the

analysis.

conjoined subject, yet the verb is singular.

Harbert and Bahloul (2002:58–60) consider these facts challenging for the
biclausal analysis of FCA. The main argument is that, in Standard Arabic, FCA can
obtain in situations where a monoclausal/phrasal coordination analysis is forced,
as in the data in (39–41). However, notice that Standard Arabic, as opposed to the
modern Arabic dialects, displays partial agreement in the context of postverbal
plural subjects. This in turn implies that what appears as FCA may in fact be a
manifestation of partial agreement.
However, there are facts that remain difﬁcult to reconcile with the biclausal
analysis of FCA. In Standard Arabic it appears that there are cases of genuine
FCA. Harbert and Bahloul (2002:59) provide the example in (42), where the verb
agrees with the ﬁrst subject pronoun on the right. The latter is in turn conjoined
with an NP and both bind a reciprocal.
(42)
tu¯hibbu hiya wa ʔaxuu-haa baʕDahumaa

‘She and her brother love each other.’
In (42), the lefthand subject pronoun is feminine singular, thus agreeing clearly
with the verb. The status of the sentence in (42) is not clear. Such sentences,
however, may not provide a fatal challenge to the biclausal account of FCA.
Gender agreement does behave differently from number in Arabic. After all, it
is the agreement that may be preserved under the VS order. It may turn out that

92
Sentential agreement
gender agreement with the ﬁrst conjunct is due to the morphological merger that
takes place between the subject and the verb and is more sensitive to the linear
relation with the postverbal subject (Ouhalla 1994a). This hypothesis is plausible,
given that in the Arabic dialects studied by Aoun, Benmamoun and Sportiche
(1994), which do not have the option of merging the subject and the verb in the
morphology, the equivalent of the sentence in (42) is ungrammatical.

Clearly more research is warranted on the distribution of the agreement features
in Arabic. An in-depth analysis of the contrast between number and gender may
help shed light on whether a biclausal analysis can be maintained for FCA.6
4.5
Impersonal agreement
The agreement asymmetries we have discussed so far mostly involve full
or partial agreement between the verb and the subject. One type of agreement that
has not received adequate attention is impersonal agreement. This is the type of
agreement that arises in the context of existential constructions where the indeﬁnite
lexical subject co-occurs with an expletive. In this section, we will rely exclusively
on the data and analyses discussed by Halila (1992) and Hoyt (2002).7
Hoyt deals with Rural Palestinian Arabic (RPA), where he discovered that
existential constructions display an alternation between full agreement with the
lexical subject or no (impersonal) agreement. The sentences in (45) from Hoyt
(2002:111) clearly illustrate this alternation.
(45)

6 See Soltan (2007) for a minimalist analysis of FCA.
7 See also Eid (1993) and Mohammad (1999b) for further discussion of the syntax of
inﬂected prepositions and existential constructions.

4.5 Impersonal agreement
93
In (45a) the auxiliary verb alternates between no agreement (baKa) or full agree-
ment (baKu). That this alternation is clearly one of presence vs. absence of agree-
ment is conﬁrmed by (45b). In (45b) the lexical subject is feminine, yet the
auxiliary participle alternates between feminine agreement and the default third
person masculine form. In other words, unlike the agreement asymmetry rela-
tive to word order that is attested in Standard Arabic, where gender agreement
may obtain under both alternations, in existential constructions in RPA, no partial
agreement with the lexical subject is attested. Rather, the subject either fully agrees
or doesn’t agree with the verb or participle.
Halila (1992:301–302) provides similar facts from Tunisian Arabic. In sentences
containing the expletive particle famma, the auxiliary verb can optionally agree
with the lexical subject.8

Notice that in (46a) the main lexical subject is feminine singular while the auxiliary
verb carries (default) masculine singular agreement. Similarly, in (46b) the main
lexical subject is plural while the auxiliary verb again carries (default) masculine
singular agreement. By contrast, in (47) the auxiliary verb fully agrees with the
lexical subject. The auxiliary verb in (47a) carries feminine singular agreement
and thus agrees with the feminine singular lexical subject and in (47b) it carries
plural agreement and therefore agrees with the plural lexical subject.
Hoyt advances strong arguments to show that the alternation in question is
sensitive to the scope of the indeﬁnite lexical subject. He provides the sentences
in (48) to illustrate this interplay between agreement and scope.

In (48a) the universal quantiﬁer takes scope over the existential quantiﬁer. By
contrast, in (48b) the existential quantiﬁer takes scope over the universal quan-
tiﬁer. The latter interpretation strongly correlates with full agreement on the
verb.
Hoyt discusses further instances of the alternation between full agreement
and impersonal agreement. The alternation in general seems to be semantically
grounded. Hoyt provides a syntactic account for the agreement alternation. The
essence of the analysis is that the indeﬁnite lexical subject may be an NP without a
determiner or a DP with a determiner. The critical assumption that Hoyt makes is
that Case is a property of the determiner (the DP layer of the nominal phrase). His
main idea is that a nominal phrase endowed with a non-interpretable feature such
as Case is forced to enter into agreement relations resulting in full agreement in the
existential predicate. Nominal phrases that do not have the DP layer and therefore
lack Case do not enter into such relations, which in turn results in impersonal
agreement.
This analysis raises a number of questions. First, it is not at all evident that in the
context of impersonal agreement, the indeﬁnite lexical subject is not structurally
Case marked. It is plausible that it is Case marked but with partitive lexical Case.
However, the data provided by Hoyt do not provide any support one way or the
other. Second, the two nominal projections, the putative NP and DP, are overtly
identical and the question is whether there is any independent motivation for the
claim that there is an additional functional projection, namely DP, in one but not
the other.
These problems notwithstanding, the agreement alternation in existential con-
texts adds another layer of complexity to the overall problem of subject agreement
in Arabic. It is clearly different from the well-known Standard Arabic agreement
asymmetry. It is not sensitive to word order and the asymmetry at hand seems
to involve absence vs. presence of agreement rather than partial vs. full agree-
ment. This in turn suggests that a uniﬁed account may not be possible or even
desirable. The two different asymmetries and alternations may require separate
accounts.

Conclusion
Subject–verb agreement in Standard Arabic and the spoken modern
dialects provide a rich array of agreement facts. The fact that in the imperfec-
tive paradigm person and number features occur on opposite sides of the verb
(as preﬁxes and sufﬁxes respectively) raises questions about whether they con-
stitute a discontinuous morpheme or whether they are separate and independent
morphemes. This is an important question for both morphology and syntax. With
regard to the agreement asymmetries in Standard Arabic, we have provided argu-
ments to support a non-syntactic morpho-phonological account whose main import
is that the number feature in the VS order is present syntactically but spelled-out by
the merged subject in PF. This option is not available to the modern dialects where
the verb and the subject tend to fully agree regardless of the relative order of the
verb and the subject. A question that remains is whether this difference between
the two main Arabic varieties can be reduced to some independent property or
parameter. Another related asymmetry we discussed arises in the context of coor-
dinated subjects where only in the VS order may the verb agree with the closest
(left hand) conjunct. The approach we discussed argues for a clausal coordination
account for close conjunct agreement on the basis of the distribution of number
sensitive items. If it turns out that the clausal analysis for ﬁrst conjunct agreement
is not warranted, a question then would arise as to whether the agreement asym-
metry that Standard Arabic displays in the context of simple plural subjects and
the agreement asymmetry that the spoken modern dialects display in the context
of coordinated subjects can receive a uniﬁed analysis. It is not clear to us that
such uniﬁed analysis is warranted, but the fact that both asymmetries arise in the
same context (VS) is, to put it mildly, intriguing. One could add to this puzzle
the agreement asymmetry that arises in the context of indeﬁnite subjects in some
Arabic dialects.9 In short, agreement in Arabic varieties is a rich testing ground
for issues related to morphology and syntax and the relation between them and
also for issues related to language variation and change.

reader is referred to Hallman (2000).

The syntax of sentential negation
5.1
Introduction
Modern Standard Arabic and the modern Arabic dialects have different
realizations of sentential negation, where the negative markers vary as to whether
they are hosted by a head and whether they carry tense and agreement. In all
dialects, however, the agreement paradigm of negative imperatives is richer than
the agreement paradigm of positive imperatives. The negative markers also interact
in intriguing ways with negative polarity items. We will take up each issue in order.
5.2
Sentential negation in the modern Arabic dialects
In most modern Arabic dialects, there may be at least two possible forms
of sentential negation, depending on whether the negative is hosted by the verb
or whether it is realized independently, a fact that will become signiﬁcant as we
proceed.
In Moroccan Arabic (1a), sentential negation, when it attaches to the verb,
is realized by the “discontinuous” negative ma-ˇs. In Lebanese Arabic (1b), the
negative enclitic ˇs is optional.

b. l-walad ma-ʔara-(ˇs)

‘The boy didn’t read the book.’
In other dialects such as Syrian Arabic (2a; Cowell 1964:3831) and Kuwaiti (2b;
Brustad 2000:285) only ma is used.

In the context of some verbal predicates and non-verbal predicates, sentential
negation may be realized differently. In Moroccan Arabic (3a), the negative pro-
clitic ma and the negative enclitic ˇs are realized as one single non-discontinuous
element. In Egyptian Arabic (3b, Brustad 2000:283) and Lebanese Arabic, there
is also a non-discontinuous element mi-ˇs (3c). In yet other dialects, such as Syrian
(3d, Cowell 1964:386), the negative muu is used (3d).

Brustad (2000) provides a detailed discussion of the two different negative forms
and their syntactic and pragmatic properties in different dialects representing the
different regions of the Arabic-speaking world. She provides the table given in
(4), which gives the range of variation between dialects (see Brustad 2000:282).
Brustad refers to the negative that is used in the context of non-verbal predicates
and some verbal predicates as predicate negation, which she contrasts with what
she calls verbal negation, which is used in the context of verbal predicates.

The syntax of sentential negation
We will discuss a possible syntactic account for the bifurcation in the table above,
but ﬁrst we need to settle the issues of the syntactic status of sentential nega-
tion (as head, speciﬁer, or adverbial) and whether it is generated directly on its
host, when it has one, rather than merging with its host in the syntax (or even
post-syntax).
5.2.1
The syntactic representation and derivation of
sentential negation
There are good reasons to treat the negative ma as the head of its own
syntactic projection. First, ma and its variant ma-ˇs can host subject clitics, which
is a property of heads. This situation obtains in various dialects as shown by the
paradigms below from Moroccan (Caubet 1996:3), Egyptian (Eid 1991:50), and
Kuwaiti (Brustad 2000:296).

Second, in some dialects, the negative element carries agreement, again a property
of heads, as illustrated in (6) from a Gulf dialect (Matar 1976).
(6)
haadhi mi zoojti
this
not wife-my
‘This is not my wife.’
Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the negative is a head element.
The next issue is whether the negative element heads its own syntactic pro-
jection. For the independent (Brustad’s predicate) negation, if it is a head, then
it most likely heads its own syntactic projection. For the dependent (Brustad’s
verbal) negation, there are arguments from recent analyses of sentential negation
in various languages that it also heads its own projection (see e.g. Ouhalla 1991;
Benmamoun 1992a, 2000; Shlonsky 1997). By allowing the negative to host its
own syntactic projection, we won’t have to posit two types of negatives. Suppose

5.2 Sentential negation in the modern Arabic dialects
99
that the difference between verbal and predicate negation has to do with whether
negation has merged with a host. Notice that the element that always merges
with negation is the verb in past tense sentences. As far as we know there are no
dialects of Arabic where this is not the case. How can this be explained? Recall
from chapter 2 that in past tense sentences in Arabic dialects the verb must move
to tense. Now, if we generate sentential negation between TP and VP (7), the fact
that in the past tense only the verbal negation form is allowed follows.
(7)

The verb must move to tense but because of minimality it cannot cross over the
negative head. The only way to circumvent minimality is for the verb to move to
negation, merge with it and then move to tense, as illustrated in (8).

Let us turn now to the so-called predicate negation. Here the negative is inde-
pendent in that it is not supported phonologically by another head. Elaborate data
on both negatives is given in Brustad (2000). The contexts where this negative
occurs in these sources are given below.2

With respect to (9) and (10), where the negative occurs in the context of adjectives,
participles and the imperfective verb, the syntactic analysis captures the facts. In
those sentences, the main predicate, be it an adjective, participle, or a verb, does
not need to raise to T, there is no need to merge with negation.3 Optional merger
with negation may have to do with focus and scope (see Brustad 2000).4
3 Brustad glosses (9b) as a past tense sentence. Actually, it would be more accurate to
gloss it as a present perfect sentence. See Mughazy (2004) for an insightful analysis of
the so-called present perfect in Egyptian Arabic.
4 This situation obtains with a wide range of non-verbal predicates in Moroccan. In (i–v)
we give a more exhaustive list of contexts where merger is optional.

The potentially problematic cases are in (11), where predicate negation is used
in the context of a past tense sentence. However, a closer look at the facts reveals
that they are actually not problematic. Notice that in all dialects, the sentences in
(11) are yes-no questions. While we cannot make judgments about the Egyptian
and Syrian sentences, as far as the Moroccan sentence is concerned, it has the
interpretation of isn’t it the case that you were in the house, with the part of the
statement you were in the house embedded within an interrogative sentence that
consists of the negative only because expletive subjects are null in Arabic and so is
the present tense. In addition, there is no verbal copula in the present tense, which
basically leads to a sentence whose only overt element is the negative. Therefore, a
more accurate analysis of, certainly (11b), and most probably (11a,c), is as in (13).

The past tense sentence is embedded within the matrix present tense negative
sentence. Within the past tense sentence the verb must move to tense. The matrix
negative sentence is a present tense sentence and since there is nothing that merges
or that must merge with negation the independent form of negation (i.e. the
predicate negation) is used.
This analysis immediately predicts that we should be able to get sentential
negation in the embedded clauses, which in turn must merge with the verb since
the sentence is in the past tense. This prediction is correct. Consider the example
in (14):
(14)
maˇsi ma-kunti-ˇs
f
d-daar?
Moroccan Arabic
Neg Neg-be.past.2sf-Neg in the-house
‘Isn’t it the case that you were not in the house?’
By positing two sentences in (14), with a main clause and a subordinate clause,
we accommodate two sentential negatives, one in the higher clause and one in the
lower clause. The negative in the lower clause must merge with the verb because
of the past tense of the sentence.

103
Moreover, since the embedded sentence is in the past tense (and not in the present
tense as the matrix sentence), we predict the merger between the verb and negation.
That is, we expect only verbal negation but not predicate negation, in the sense of
Brustad. This prediction is also correct.

In short, it is safe to conclude that the distribution of the two negative forms can
receive a syntactic analysis relying on the interaction between the tense, negation,
and the predicate. The apparent problematic cases involving the use of the verbal
negative in the context of the past tense can be explained after a careful analysis
of the cases in question that reveals that they are complex sentences where the
negative and the verb are located in independent clauses. Therefore, a simpler
analysis would be to posit one single negative and spell it out as the so-called
verbal negation when it merges with a head and a predicate negation when it does
not merge with a head. Below we will show that the same analysis can be extended
to Standard Arabic. However, before doing that we need to discuss one issue that
arises if we consider the two surface negatives as the realization/spell-out of the
same negative.
5.2.2
The status of the two negative morphemes ma and ˇs
Recall that in some dialects, such as Egyptian and Moroccan, when
negation merges with the predicate (be it verbal or nominal), ma is realized as
enclitic and ˇs as proclitic. The issue is to explain how the merged predicate ends
up between the two elements of sentential negation. There are various possibilities
but we will consider only two here. The ﬁrst analysis that has been suggested is
that ma is the head of negation and ˇs is its speciﬁer, as illustrated in (17).

104
The syntax of sentential negation
This analysis, which echoes similar analyses of Standard French where negation
is realized by two elements that can sandwich the verb (Pollock 1989; Ouhalla
1990; Moritz and Valois 1994), derives the proclitic nature of ma by generating it
in the head position and allowing the verb to merge with it. The enclitic nature of
ˇs, on the other hand, is derived simply by cliticizing it onto the complex verb+ma
in T, as illustrated in (18).

One major attractive feature of this analysis is that by generating both ma and
ˇs in NegP, the problem of the absence of a double negative reading that would
have arisen if they were generated in different negative projections is avoided.
There is no double negation because there is only negative projection. However,
there are problems with the conﬁguration in (17) and the analysis that is based
on it.
First, notice that in the conﬁguration in (17), the head of negation ma follows
its speciﬁer. Therefore, if nothing happens, i.e. if no head merges with ma and
takes it higher, it is not clear how the two negatives are not spelled-out with ma as
proclitic and ˇs as enclitic. That is, it is not clear why we do not get the opposite
order, whereby ˇs precedes ma. Moreover, as shown above, not all predicates
obligatorily merge with negation.
(19)
huwa maˇsi hna
he
Neg here
‘He is not here.’
In fact some of them, such as PPs and complex NP predicates, do not allow
the extraction of the head and the stranding of the rest of the phrase (21), or the
movement of the whole phrase to merge with ma (22) ((21–22) contrast with (20)).

Of course, we can force the head of negation to move, probably in order to take
scope over tense (as in Laka 1990). However, this solution would not extend to
constituent negation, where clearly no movement of ma takes place to get the right
order.
(23)
ma-ˇsi
kull
wəld hna
Neg-Neg every boy

‘Not every boy is here.’
In constituent negation, as in (23), the two negative particles occur in a ﬁxed order
with ma preceding ˇs(i).
Second, Watson (1993) provides examples where the negative maaˇsi is used in
negative answers to questions (p. 226) and in elliptical contexts (p. 121).
(24)
a. zawˇziˇs

The three contexts in (23–25) challenge the idea that ˇs is in the speciﬁer of a
projection headed by ma.

106

Benmamoun (2000) provides an alternative account whereby both ma and ˇs
occupy the head position of negation, as illustrated in (26).

This analysis may not be elegant, but by treating both ma and ˇs effectively as
heads of NegP it allows for the variation we see in the realization of sentential
negation across Arabic dialects, which is consistent with the historical evolution
of sentential negation. As we mentioned above, in some dialects only ma is used
while in other dialects both ma and ˇs are used. Interestingly, there are other dialects
that use ˇs only. Abu-Haidar (1979:110) discusses this possibility in the Lebanese
dialect of Baskinta (27a) and Palva (1972:42) reports the same phenomenon in a
Jordanian dialect (27b):
(27)
a. bi-t-¯hib-ˇs
ˇsiʁl
il-bayt
Asp-3f-likes-Neg work the-house
‘She does not like housework.’
b. bədd-i-ˇs
want-my-Neg
‘I don’t want.’
This shows that ˇs can realize sentential negation on its own. Putting it in the head
position of negation allows it to fulﬁll that function.
ma is undoubtedly related to the Standard Arabic negative maa that we will
discuss below. ˇs, on the other hand, evolved from the word ˇsayʔ, which means
‘thing’ (Ouhalla 2002).5 Compared to ma, ˇs seems to have evolved relatively lately
to reinforce the negative ma, very much on a par with the situation in Romance
5 While maintaining that -ˇs(i) is probably generated in the Spec of the negative headed by
ma, Ouhalla (2002), based on the distribution of this element in other contexts (mainly
wh-phrases and existential quantiﬁers), argues for an insightful analysis whereby -ˇs(i) is
a variable.

5.2 Sentential negation in the modern Arabic dialects
107
(Zanuttini 1997). Therefore, it is reasonable to expect an element that has evolved
to reinforce another element to be generated with it, i.e. in the same position,
namely the head of NegP. We should point out that this is tentative and further
investigation of the history of sentential negation in Arabic (and other grammatical
markers) is critically needed.
5.2.3
A negative copula?
As pointed out above, negation seems to be able to merge with a nomi-
native pronominal subject. As can be seen from the table in (28), the independent
nominative pronoun is nearly completely identical to the pronoun incorporated
into negation.

As is typical of such situations, at least two possibilities suggest themselves.6
On the one hand, the incorporated pronoun could be treated as a realization of
agreement features on negation that agrees with a subject, possibly null. On the
other hand, the incorporated pronoun could be analyzed as a genuine pronominal
subject generated in the canonical subject position, Spec of the projection where
it gets its semantic role, and incorporated into negation by a syntactic or post-
syntactic morphological process.
The proposal that the incorporated “pronoun” is a realization of agreement is
not far-fetched because there are instances where negation clearly agrees with a
subject. We saw one case above from a Gulf dialect. Standard Arabic offers a
more dramatic example where the negative laysa displays the full array of subject
agreement features displayed by verbs.
6 The same issue arises in the context of accusative and genitive clitics, and, for some, even
subject agreement, in Arabic. The issue is whether the clitics, and subject agreement,
are incorporated pronouns generated in argument position or genuine agreement afﬁxes
(licensing a null pronoun under analyses that posit such an element).

108

(29)

‘We are not in the house.’
However, there are reasons not to accept the agreement account and opt rather
for the incorporation account. First, unlike genuine cases of subject agreement in
Moroccan Arabic, where a verb can fully agree with a postverbal subject (30),7
in the case of negation, a post-negative subject is not allowed. In other words, the
negative-plus-pronoun complex is in complementary distribution with a lexical
subject (31).8

(31)
*ma-huwa-ˇs l-wəld

The ungrammaticality of (31) follows under the incorporation account since the
pronoun would compete with the lexical subject for the subject position.
Second, if this were a case of agreement we would expect it to be able to
co-occur with a verb, such as the past tense verb, but this prediction is not borne
out.
(32)
*ma-huwa-ˇs qra
Neg-he-Neg read.3ms
The negative-plus-pronoun variant seems to be found mostly in copular construc-
tions. Since Arabic dialects allow the subject to agree with more than one head
(such as an auxiliary or aspectual verb and the main verb), it is not clear why the
negative that agrees with the subject should be restricted only to copular construc-
tions. While it would require some additional assumptions to preempt movement
of the pronominal subject in the context of a verbal predicate, in the context of past
tense sentences this follows easily from the need of the verb to move to T. If the
subject moves to Neg, the verb would then need to cross over negation, in violation
of minimality. With respect to imperfective verbs the situation is somewhat more
complicated. In Moroccan Arabic, we saw in chapter 2 that the verb obligatorily
merges with negation. It would be interesting to see what the situation is like in
dialects where the imperfective verb does not need to merge with negation. All
7 See chapter 4 for a detailed discussion of subject–verb agreement.
8 (31) seems to improve with a pause between negation and the lexical “subject,” in which
case the latter could be treated as an appositive.

5.2 Sentential negation in the modern Arabic dialects

else being equal, both options should exist, i.e. either the verb or the pronoun
could merge with negation.
Therefore, we can maintain the assumption that there is only one negative
element that can be realized in different forms depending on merger with the verb
and the subject or no merger at all.
There is a potentially more difﬁcult challenge for the incorporation account.
In some dialects, the incorporated pronoun is in the Accusative Case rather than
Nominative. This is attested in Hassaniya (Iaach 1996:168) and in Lebanese
Arabic.

As far as Lebanese Arabic is concerned, recall that the complementizer also
assigns Accusative Case to the embedded “subject,” as evidenced by the fact that
the subject is realized as an accusative clitic on the complementizer (see chapter 2).
Therefore, it is not far-fetched to assume that negation can also assign Accusative
Case to the subject that merges with it. We have already seen a case of the negative
laysa assigning Accusative Case to the predicate.
Moreover, in Moroccan Arabic the negative ʕəmmər ‘never’ assigns Genitive
or Accusative Case to the embedded subject:
(35)
a. ʕəmmər-i ma-tlaqit-u
never-my Neg-met.1s-him
‘I never met him.’
b. ʕəmmər-ni ma-tlaqit-u
never-me
Neg-met.1s-him
‘I never met him.’

110
The syntax of sentential negation
Therefore, it is plausible that the negative assigns Accusative Case to the
pronominal subject that merges with it in Lebanese Arabic, in which case the
incorporation account can be maintained.
5.3
Sentential negation in Standard Arabic
Standard Arabic has at least ﬁve distinct negative particles (Moutaouakil
1993). The negative particle laa occurs in sentences with verbal predicates with
present tense interpretation (36).
(36)
a. T-Tullaab-u
ya-drus-uu-n
the-students
3-study-mp-ind
‘The students study.’
b. T-Tullab-u
laa
ya-drus–uu-n
the-students Neg 3-study-mp-ind
‘The students do not study.’
The tensed variants of laa are lam and lan. The former, lam, occurs in past
tense sentences (37) and the latter, lan, is used in future tense sentences (38).
Notice that in the non-negative form the verb is in the perfective form in the past
tense.
(37)
a. T-Tullaab-u

b. T-Tullaab-u

the-students Neg.fut 3-study-mp
‘The students will not study.’
b. T-Tullabu
sa-ya-drus-uun
the-students fut-3-study-mp
‘The students will study.’
In addition to these three negative particles, Standard Arabic has another variant
of laa, laysa, that occurs in the context of non-verbal predicates (39a–c) and
also in present tense sentences containing verbal predicates (39d) (Moutaouakil
1993:85–86; Fassi Fehri 1993:173).9

laysa is also notable for the fact that it carries subject agreement and assigns
Accusative Case to the predicate, as is clear from the examples in (39a,b). In
(39a), for example, the negative carries third person feminine agreement and
assigns Accusative Case to the predicate adjective.
The ﬁfth negative is maa, which is undoubtedly related to the negative that
occurs in the modern Arabic dialects. This negative occurs in a variety of contexts,
as illustrated by the following examples from Moutaouakil (1993:80–81):
(40)
a. maa saafarat
hindun
Neg traveled.past.3fs Hind
‘Hind did not travel/go on a trip.’
b. maa yu-saaﬁru ʕamrun ʔilla

‘Amr travels only during the summer.’

d. maa hindun ¯haziinatun
Neg Hind
sad
‘Hind is not sad.’
e. maa xaalidun ﬁi l-bayti
Neg Khalid
in the-house’
‘Khalid is not in the house.’
In (40a) maa negates a past tense sentence. In (40b) it negates an habitual present
tense sentence. In (40c–e) it negates a verbless sentence with a nominal, adjectival,
and PP predicate respectively.

112
The syntax of sentential negation
To sum up, there are ﬁve different negatives in Modern Standard Arabic, a
situation that appears to differ radically from the one that obtains in the modern
dialects. In the latter, there are at most three surface realizations of sentential nega-
tion (if we include the negative that incorporates the subject pronouns). However,
we suggested above that it might be possible to posit one single negative form
and syntactically derive the distribution of the three surface forms. Can the same
approach be used to analyze negation in Standard Arabic, which displays even
more surface forms than the modern dialects?
5.3.1
laa and its tensed variants
Let us start with laa and its tensed variants lam and lan. laa occurs in the
present tense and we showed in chapter 2 that the present tense is not morpho-
phonologically realized in all Arabic dialects. Since laa occurs in the present tense
it is the only one among the trio of laa, lam, and lan that does not carry tense. This
assumption has ample support but we will just list three contexts. First, unlike
the truly tensed negatives lam and lan, laa is used as a constituent negative, as
illustrated by (41) from Moutaouakil (1993:86).
(41)
laa
raˇzula ﬁi d-dari
Neg man
in the-house
‘No man is in the house.’
Second, it is the only negative used to negate imperative sentences (42), which are
not tensed (Ouhalla 1993).
(42)
laa
ta-bkii
Neg 2-cry
‘Do not cry.’
Third, it is the only negative that is used as the particle for denial in discourse (43).
(43)
laa, lam
ʔa-ktub
no, Neg.past 1s-write
‘No, I didn’t write.’ [as an answer to a question]
Turning to the tensed variants of laa, namely lam and lan, the analysis is rather
straightforward. Suppose that laa heads a negation between TP and VP, as argued
in Benmamoun (1992a, 2000) and Ouhalla (1993), as illustrated in (44).

Since past tense and future tense features are located in T, the closest head to T
is the negative. The negative is able to support tense in Standard Arabic, which
in turn obviates the need for verb movement. If T contains past tense features,
the negative is spelled-out as lam. On the other hand, if tense contains future
tense features it is spelled-out as lan. If negation stays in situ and does not merge
with any functional element, it is spelled-out as the default tenseless negative
laa.
Notice that given minimality the verb cannot move to tense across the negative
head to yield the ungrammatical forms in (45).

The syntax of sentential negation
In this respect, the main difference between Standard Arabic and the modern
dialects has to do with whether negation can carry tense. In Standard Arabic this
possibility is available, resulting in different surface realizations of negation but
the same verb form, namely the imperfective form. On the other hand, in the
modern dialects negation is not a possible host for tense, which in turn forces
verb movement through negation in the contexts of the tense that forces such
movement, namely the past tense.10
5.3.2
laysa
Let us now turn to laysa. This negative has traditionally been analyzed as
a verb. The main reason is because it carries the same subject agreement inﬂection
as verbs. In (47) the full agreement paradigm of laysa is given.11

The agreement paradigm on laysa is the paradigm that is usually found on
perfective verbs, which are mainly restricted to the past tense.12 However, this by
10 Recall, however, that the verb must be adjacent to the tensed negative, which suggests
that morphological support is not the only motivation for the dependency between tense
and the verb. See chapter 2 for a brief discussion and Benmamoun (2000) for a more
detailed exploration of the dependency between these two elements.
11 Ouhalla (1993:278) suggests that laysa is composed of three elements: the negative laa,
a verbal copula s, and agreement.
12 The perfective form is also found in conditionals; see Wright (1889) and Wise (1975).

5.3 Sentential negation in Standard Arabic
115
itself does not settle the issue of the categorical status of laysa since it is very
plausible that diachronically the reason that agreement morphology is exclusively
sufﬁxal is because in the present tense where tense does not need a verb, the
subject may remain lower, opening up the option of a pronominal subject clitic
encliticizing onto the negative.13 Thus, the derivation of the sufﬁxal agreement
morphology on laysa in (48) could be represented as in (49).
(48)

That the sufﬁx can follow the negative laysa is attested synchronically, as is evident
from the sentence in (50) from Moutaouakil (1993:85).

laysa

Therefore, the agreement on laysa may be just a historical relic of a cliticization
process. This should not be surprising since the negative laa can carry tense, and
also the modern Arabic dialects negative can incorporate subjects as discussed
above.
The main problem with the analysis that laysa is a verb is the fact that present
tense sentences with non-verbal predicates do not have VPs, presumably because
the present tense does not need to interact with a verb, as was discussed in
chapter 2. Thus, if we were to posit a VP in the context of laysa, that would be the
13 The other option is that the negative moves higher than the subject, which in turn yields
an encliticization conﬁguration.

116
The syntax of sentential negation
only context where there is a VP in copular constructions.14 The most reasonable
assumption would be not to treat laysa as a verb but rather just as a variant of laa
that is peculiar in that it can carry agreement.15
To sum up the discussion so far, we have discussed the distribution of laa, lam,
lan, and laysa. We have explored the possibility that they are all realizations of
a negative generated in a negative projection located between TP and VP. The
two tensed negatives, lam and lan, carry tense because they move to T, preempt-
ing the movement of the verb in the process. laa and laysa do not carry tense,
but the latter is a variant of laa that can carry agreement. laa is the simplest
default negative that carries neither tense nor agreement. This leaves us with the
negative maa, which is clearly different from laa and its variants, at least phono-
logically. The question is whether the differences go deeper in that they involve
the semantics and syntax of the negative maa. We take up this issue in the next
section.
5.3.3
The negative maa
As pointed out above, maa can occur in the context of both past (51a)
and present tense sentences with verbal predicates (51b).
(51)
a. maa saafarat
hindun
Neg traveled.past.3fs Hind
‘Hind did not travel/go on a trip.’
b. maa yu-saaﬁru ʕamrun ʔilla
ﬁi S-Sayﬁ
Neg 3-travel
Amr
except in the-summer
‘Amr travels only during the summer.’
In addition, maa can negate the subject (52a–c).
(52)
a. maa mu¯hammad-un
kaatib-un
Neg Mohammad-Nom writer-Nom
‘Mohammad is not a writer.’
14 A verbal copula can occur in generic present tense sentences. Benmamoun (2000) argues
that there is a modal in those contexts that requires a verbal element.
15 The reason why the other variants of laa, namely lam and lan, do not carry agreement is
maybe because they need to be adjacent to the verb, which already carries agreement. A
restriction not to realize agreement twice on a morphological complex may be at play.
See Benmamoun (2000) for a discussion of such an analysis.

b. maa hind-un

Neg Hind-Nom sad-Nom
‘Hind is not sad.’
c. maa xaalid-un
ﬁi l-bayt-i
Neg Khalid-Nom in the-house-Gen
‘Khalid is not in the house.’
Equally crucial is the fact that maa can negate a preposed object NP (53a) and
a preposed instrumental PP (53b), as illustrated by the examples in (53) from
Moutaouakil (1993:81).
(53)
a. maa bakr-an

xaalid-un
bakr-an
Neg with-the-knife-Gen wounded.3ms Khalid-Nom Bakr-Acc
‘It is not with the knife that Khalid wounded Bakr.’
To account for the facts that maa occurs in both present and past tense sentences
without blocking verb movement to T in the latter, and that it can attach to the
subject, Benmamoun (2000) proposed that while maa patterns with laa in being
located in a negative projection between TP and the predicate, it occupies the
speciﬁer position of negation rather than the head. The conﬁguration proposed
by Benmamoun (2000:108) and the analysis of (52a) are given in (54) and (55)
respectively.

The main idea is that the subject moves through [Spec, NegP], where it picks up
the negative maa.
This analysis maintains that negation has one ﬁxed position in the Arabic
clause. The differences between the negatives are then reduced to their structural
position and their ability or inability to host inﬂection, such as agreement and
tense.
However, this analysis does not actually account for all the facts listed above.
To allow the negative to occur on the verb in the past tense, we must have the
latter move from the head position of VP to the Spec of NegP and then to the head
position of T, a pattern of movement that is theoretically problematic (it violates
structure preservation) and is not independently motivated.
Ouhalla (1993) advances an alternative analysis that captures all the syntactic
properties of maa mentioned above. Ouhalla starts off with the observation that
maa not only negates the constituent it takes scope over but also contrastively
focuses it (see also Moutaouakil 1993). Thus, the interpretation of (53a) is that it
is not Bakr who was wounded with the knife but someone else. Similarly, in (53b)
the interpretation is that it is not the knife that was the instrument of wounding
but some other instrument. The examples in (53) illustrate cases of contrastive
focus that impact one constituent, the object NP and instrumental PP respectively.
Negative contrastive focus can also impact a whole proposition. As Ouhalla puts it,
“negative contrastive focus is used to assert the falsity of a given prevailing piece
of information, which can be encoded in a whole proposition (sentence) . . . or in
just a constituent of the sentence.”
Ouhalla advances more arguments to show that maa patterns with afﬁrmative
focus elements that occupy the left periphery of the clause in Standard Arabic. In
particular, he draws a parallelism between maa and the focus/emphasis particles

Based on these facts, among others, Ouhalla argues that unlike laa and its variants,

the head position of a focus projection located above TP/IP. The representation
that Ouhalla (1993:288) suggests is given in (58).

From its position in the head F of FP, maa can enter into dependency relations
with elements that undergo negative contrastive focus. The relation can obtain
at a distance and does not have to involve the displacement, which is the case
with negative contrastive focus that impacts the whole proposition or a constituent
within the sentence, as in (59), which Ouhalla uses to illustrate constituent focus
at a distance.

for an analysis of how the dependencies between focus markers and the elements that
are focused are captured.
17 FM stands for focus marker. Ouhalla (1993:279) uses capitals to indicate focus.

120
The syntax of sentential negation
With respect to cases where the constituent that is contrastively focused (52–53)
is fronted and attaches to maa, Ouhalla suggests that in this situation FP is not
overtly ﬁlled. Rather, the negative maa is generated within the phrase headed by
the focused constituent inside the clause and the whole phrase moves to the Spec
of FP.

Ouhalla successfully captures the similarities between maa and focus markers.
His analysis also avoids the problem of why maa does not block verb movement.
Under his analysis, this simply follows from the fact that maa is not in the
path of verb movement to tense, since it is either generated in a higher head,
FP, or within a phrase. In fact, under Ouhalla’s account, maa does not head a
negative projection but only provides/spells-out the negative feature of the focus
head.
5.4
Person agreement and positive imperatives versus
negative imperatives
In all Arabic dialects, there is a major difference between negative imper-
atives and positive imperatives. The difference has to do with person agreement.
In positive imperatives, person agreement is not realized while in negative imper-
atives it must be realized, as illustrated by the paradigms in (61a), (61b), and (61c)
from Standard Arabic, Lebanese Arabic, and Moroccan Arabic respectively.

122
The syntax of sentential negation
In Standard Arabic, which marks mood morphologically, both positive and
negative imperatives belong to the jussive paradigm. The jussive paradigm is
characterized by the absence of the vowel and nasal ending that is found in
indicative forms (Wright 1889).19
The only distinction between positive and negative imperatives seems to be
in person agreement. The question then is: why is person obligatorily absent in
positive imperatives and obligatorily present in negative imperatives? There are
no clear answers to this question, which hasn’t been dealt with extensively in the
literature. For Benmamoun (2000), the reason for the difference is that negation
has a nominal feature that needs to be paired with a nominal element. Since
there is no nominal element in imperative sentences (there being no subject),
person agreement, which is nominal in nature, is inserted to satisfy the nominal
requirement of negation. Another possible analysis that could be promising is
that on a par with other languages where different verbal paradigms are used
in negative imperatives, the difference could be to do with some requirement of
negation, for example, that it be licensed by a temporal head, which in turn comes
with its complete set of agreement features. Clearly, this is an area that requires
further exploration and where comparative research can be particularly valuable.
Finally, another notable fact about imperatives is that they require the negative
laa in Standard Arabic (62) and merger with negation in the Modern dialects, as
illustrated in the Moroccan Arabic sentences in (63).20

5.5 Negative polarity items in Moroccan Arabic

Those facts follow if there is a projection higher than negation to which the verb
must move.21
5.5
Negative polarity items in Moroccan Arabic
Moroccan Arabic NPIs present a mixed picture. One class of NPIs cannot
precede sentential negation, as shown by the ungrammaticality of (64d).22
(64)
a. ma-ˇza
¯hədd
Neg-came.3ms one
‘No one came.’
b. ma-ˇsəft
¯hədd
Neg-saw.1s one
‘I didn’t see anyone.’
c. ma-tlaqit
¯hədd
Neg-met.1s one
‘I didn’t meet with anyone.’
d. *¯hədd ma-ˇza
one
Neg-came.3ms
The NPI ¯hədd seems to require the negative licenser to c-command it.
However, another class of NPIs can precede the sentential negative. We can
distinguish two major types of such NPIs. Nominal NPIs and what we will refer
to as head NPIs, following Benmamoun (2006). Let us start with nominal NPIs.
Consider the sentences in (65).
(65)
a. ma-qrit
¯hətta ktab
Neg-read.1s even book
‘I didn’t read any book.’
b. ma-ˇza
¯hətta wa¯həd
Neg-came.3ms even one
‘No one came.’
c. ¯hətta wa¯həd ma-ˇza
even one
Neg-came.3ms
‘No one came.’
21 Benmamoun (2000) posits a projection headed by an imperative feature, following
various analyses that have proposed similar projections for other languages.
22 Moroccan Arabic NPIs are in complementary distribution with ˇs. This is not the case in
all dialects (see Benmamoun 1997, 2000). See Ouhalla (2002) for a possible analysis.

124
The syntax of sentential negation
The NPI containing ¯hətta can both follow (65a,b) and precede (65d) sentential
negation. Benmamoun (1997) takes such cases as evidence that the Spec-Head
conﬁguration whereby the NPI in the speciﬁer of a projection containing the nega-
tive licenser should also be added to c-command as a licensing conﬁguration. One
strong argument for Spec-Head conﬁguration as another licensing structure comes
from left dislocated NPIs binding resumptive pronouns (Benmamoun 1997:281):
(66)
a. ¯hətta ktab ma-qrat-u
səlwa
even book Neg-read-it Salwa
‘Salwa didn’t read any book.’
b. *¯hətta ktab səlwa ma-qrat-u
even
book Salwa Neg-read-it
*‘Any book, Salwa did not read it.’
If it turns out that in Moroccan Arabic left dislocated elements are not derived
by movement but rather base-generated in their surface position, then the Spec-
Head conﬁguration is the only way to license the NPI in (66a). Notice that if the
subject intervenes between the NPI and the negative licenser the sentence becomes
ill-formed (66b). However, allowing the Spec-Head conﬁguration as a licensing
option raises the question of why the same conﬁguration is not available to the
Moroccan Arabic NPI in (64d).
This problem is taken up in Benmamoun (1996) where, building on the well-
known generalization that Arabic dialects do not allow non-speciﬁc indeﬁnites in
the preverbal subject position (see chapter 3), he argues that the reason the NPI
containing ¯hətta can occur in the preverbal negative position is because ¯hətta is a
focus and presupposition particle. This usage of ¯hətta is illustrated in (67).
(67)
a. ¯hətta nadia ˇzat
even Nadia came.3fs
‘Even Nadia came.’
b. ¯hətta nadia
tlaqit-ha
lbarə¯h
even Nadia, met.1s-her yesterday
‘Even Nadia, I met her yesterday.’
The main idea then is that the NPI containing ¯hətta can occur in the preverbal
pre-negative position thanks to the focus particle it contains. The focus particle
allows it to be fronted to left peripheral positions where focused elements can
occur (Ouhalla 1997).
In short, the distribution of Moroccan Arabic NPIs reduces to their lexical
properties. In Moroccan Arabic, one type of NPI contains a focus particle which

5.6 Conclusion
125
allows it to occur in positions not usually reserved for the other type, namely the
NPI ¯hədd.
We turn now to the other class of Moroccan Arabic NPIs that have a different
distribution from nominal NPIs. Consider the sentences in (68).
(68)
a. nadia ʕəmmər-ha ma-ˇzat
Nadia never-her
Neg-came
‘Nadia never came.’
b. ʕomar baqi ma-ˇza
Omar yet
Neg-came
‘Omar hasn’t come yet.’
The NPIs in (68) are clearly not in Spec-Head conﬁguration with negation nor are
they in its c-command domain. They are not in Spec-Head relation because they
are heads displaying all properties of heads, such as the ability to agree (69a) and
to host clitics (69b).
(69)
a. nadia baq-a ma-ˇzat
Nadia yet.fs Neg-came.3fs
‘Nadia hasn’t come yet.’
b. nadia ʕəmmər-ha ma-ˇzat
Nadia never-her
Neg-came
‘Nadia never came.’
Benmamoun (2006) capitalizes on the head status of the NPIs in (69) to argue
that because the NPIs are heads they can be licensed by virtue of the fact that
they merge with their complement, which contains the negative clause. Therefore,
the only licensing condition they are subject to is c-command. Admittedly, this is
highly tentative and would require a more exhaustive analysis of NPIs in Arabic
dialects and their distribution.
5.6
Conclusion
In this chapter, we discussed the syntax of sentential negation in the spo-
ken Arabic dialects and Standard Arabic. The main difference between the two
main varieties relates to the fact that Standard Arabic has two negative markers,
namely lam and lan, which occur in the context of past and future tenses respec-
tively. We showed that positing a negative projection between TP and VP accounts
for this fact. The verb cannot raise to tense across negation because of minimality.

126
The syntax of sentential negation
Negation, in turn, can host tense in Standard Arabic while it cannot do so in the
spoken dialects. In those dialects the same negative is used regardless of tense.
However, the negative in question merges with the verb, which circumvents rel-
ativized minimality. By contrast, in the so-called verbless sentences the negative
heads in the two main varieties of Arabic display similar syntactic distributions.
We also discussed the distribution of negative sensitive items such as negative
polarity items and negative quantiﬁers in Moroccan Arabic. These elements con-
sist of two types, phrases and heads. The phrases, in turn, can be divided into
one class that is restricted to the post-negative position and another class that
freely occurs in the pre- and post-negative positions. The analysis we discussed
requires both Spec-Head and c-command as conﬁgurational restrictions on the
distribution of these elements. C-command seems to be also a condition on the
licensing of head NPIs. The status of the latter elements is a topic that requires
further investigation.

Modes of wh-interrogation

Introduction
One of the deﬁning features of human language is displacement (from
the “here” and “now”). In syntax, displacement is observed when some elements
of sentence structure appear in positions different from those where they are inter-
preted. Typically, this is the case of wh-phrases in questions. One important goal
of syntactic analysis is to adequately capture and explain long-distance dependen-
cies between elements displaced to the periphery, e.g. wh-phrases, and the position
within the sentence to which they are related, and which can be occupied either by
a gap or by a pronominal resumptive element. An active area of research within
this domain is the variation between the resumption strategy and the gap strategy.1
Some of the questions that are raised in that regard are the following:
(1)
a. Are the grammars of the languages that use resumption instead of
the more conventional gap strategy different? How so?
b. What is the nature of the resumptive element?
c. Is the resumption strategy a uniform strategy having the same
properties cross-linguistically?
d. Is the relation between a displaced element and its corresponding
resumptive similar to the relation between a displaced element and
its corresponding gap?
The various Arabic dialects provide a good empirical base for tackling these
questions. The resumption strategy is used productively in those dialects alongside
the gap strategy, allowing one to study the difference between these strategies
within the same given language, as well as across the various Arabic dialects.

Modes of wh-interrogation
In this chapter, we analyze and discuss the different strategies available in Arabic
for forming wh-interrogatives. Because several strategies are available within a
given dialect, we are able to examine the syntactic and interpretive differences
between them. This will lead to the conclusion that chains involving gaps are
different from resumptive chains, that is, the relation between a fronted wh-phrase
and its corresponding gap is different in several respects from the relation between
a fronted wh-phrase and its corresponding resumptive element. The chapter starts
with a brief overview of wh-words and wh-interrogative forming strategies in
Arabic and then goes on to discuss the gap strategy in comparison with the
resumptive strategy. We then turn to two other strategies available in Arabic for
forming questions and discuss their similarities and differences with the gap and
resumptive strategies. To conclude, we provide the new generalizations that the
study of Arabic wh-questions contributes to the study of wh-question formation
and long-distance dependencies in general.
6.2
Wh-words and wh-interrogatives in Arabic
Four strategies are available to form wh-interrogatives in Arabic: three
of them involve a fronted wh-constituent and the fourth is an in-situ strategy. The
sentences in (2), from Lebanese Arabic, illustrate these four strategies.
(2)
a. ʔayya mmasil ˇsəft
Ø b-l-maTʕam?
Gap Strategy
which actor
saw.2ms
in-the-restaurant
‘Which actor did you see in the restaurant?’
b. ʔayya mmasil ˇsəft-o
b-l-maTʕam?
Resumptive Strategy
which actor
saw.2ms-him in-the-restaurant
‘Which actor did you see in the restaurant?’
c. miin (ya)lli ˇsəft-o
b-l-maTʕam?
Class II Resumptive
who that
saw.2ms-him in-the-restaurant
Strategy
‘Who is it that you saw in the restaurant?’
d. ˇsəft
ʔayya mmasil b-l-maTʕam?
In-situ Strategy
saw.2ms which actor
in-the-restaurant
‘Which actor did you see in the restaurant?’
In (2a), the wh-constituent appears on the left edge of a clause and is related to a
gap in the variable position, the sentence internal position of the wh-constituent
(the gap strategy). In (2b), the wh-constituent appearing on the left edge of the

6.2 Wh-words and wh-interrogatives in Arabic
129
clause is related to a resumptive pronominal element in the sentence internal posi-
tion corresponding to the wh-constituent (the resumptive strategy). Example (2c)
is a variation on the resumptive strategy whereby the clause initial wh-constituent,
which is related to a resumptive pronominal element in the sentence internal
position corresponding to the wh-constituent, immediately precedes the (deﬁ-
nite) relative clause complementizer (ya)lli ‘that’ (Class II resumptive strategy).
Finally, in (2d), the wh-constituent appears in a sentence internal position, which
corresponds to the variable position in (2a).
On the other hand, wh-words in Arabic can be divided into two classes: nominal
wh-words and adverbial wh-words.2 The following tables list the wh-words in use
in three different Arabic dialects.
(3)
Wh-words in Lebanese Arabic

a. miin
‘who’
e. ween

b. ˇsu

f. ʔeemta

c. ʔayya ‘which’
g. kiif
‘how’
d. kam
‘how many’
h. lee(ˇs)/laˇsu ‘why’
i. ʔaddee(ˇs) ‘how much’
2 Wahba (1984) categorizes the various wh-words in Egyptian Arabic into two groups:
nominal wh-words (i) and non-nominal wh-words (ii). Her classiﬁcation can easily carry
over to all wh-words in Arabic.
(i)
Nominal wh-phrases: miin ‘who,’ ʔeh ‘what,’ ʔanhi NP ‘which NP’
(ii)
Non-nominal wh-phrases: a. Prepositional phrases: maʕa miin ‘with whom,’
min ʔimta ‘how long,’
ʕala feen ‘where to’
b. Adverbial wh-phrases: feen ‘where,’ ʔimta
‘when,’ ʔizzay ‘how,’
leeh ‘why’
It is not clear which criteria are used to classify the wh-words as they are in Wahba
(1984). For instance, why is a wh-word like ʔimta ‘when’ classiﬁed as non-nominal,
when it can clearly occur as the complement of a preposition, as illustrated in min ʔimta
‘how long,’ a position typically reserved for nominal elements. Similarly, in Lebanese
Arabic, ween ‘where’ and ʔeemta ‘when’ can be classiﬁed as nominal since they can
occur as complements of prepositions, as illustrated in (iii):
(iii)
a. ¯hadd-ween seekniin?
near-where live.p
‘Near where do you/they/we live?’
b. la-ʔeemta beeʔyiin
to-when
staying.p
‘Until when are you/they/we staying?’

All the strategies illustrated in (2) are in use in various Arabic dialects; however,
not all the Arabic dialects make use of all four strategies. Lebanese Arabic seems to
have all four available and will therefore be used here to illustrate the various gen-
eralizations regarding wh-interrogatives. Modern Standard Arabic does not make
use of the in-situ strategy, which is the default strategy for Egyptian Arabic. When
a language makes use of more than one strategy for forming wh-interrogatives,
the question is to characterize the differences between those strategies, in terms
of their syntactic and interpretive properties. This is the task we set for ourselves
in this chapter.
6.3
The gap strategy and the resumptive strategy
In dialects that make use of both the gap strategy and the resumptive
strategy, one can detect a contrast between wh-words that can be related to a gap
inside a wh-interrogative and those that can be related to a resumptive element
inside a wh-interrogative. Wh-words in Arabic can thus be divided into two classes
with respect to the possibility of being resumed by a pronominal: whereas all wh-
words in Arabic can be used in wh-questions involving gaps, there are restrictions
on which wh-elements can appear in wh-questions involving resumptives.
The sentences in (6) and (7) illustrate the gap strategy in Lebanese Arabic and
Modern Standard Arabic respectively:3
3 Arabic does not allow preposition stranding, therefore, when a wh-word occurs within
a prepositional phrase, the whole PP is pied-piped to the sentence initial position, as
indicated in (i):

Whereas all wh-words in Standard Arabic and in Lebanese Arabic can be related
to a gap inside the sentence, as illustrated in (6) and (7), only miin/man ‘who’ and
ʔayy(a) NP ‘which NP’ can be related to a resumptive element inside a simple
sentence. This fact is illustrated in (8).
(8)
a. miin/ʔayya mariiD zeerit-o
naadia?
who/which patient visited.3fs-him Nadia
‘Who/which patient did Nadia visit?’
b. man/ʔayya mariiDin zaarat-hu
naadia?
Who/which patient
visited.3fs-him Nadia
‘Who/which patient did Nadia visit?’
The resumptive element which occurs within the sentence is equivalent to the weak
pronominal element that appears in non-subject argument positions in Arabic.

6.3 The gap strategy and the resumptive strategy
133
In those positions, the pronominal element cliticizes onto the lexical head that
precedes it, be it a V, N, or P, as illustrated in (9–12) for Lebanese Arabic and
(13–16) for Standard Arabic.

The resumptive element related to miin/man ‘who’ is always third person mascu-
line and singular, whereas the features of the resumptive element related to ʔayy(a)
NP ‘which NP’ vary with those of the NP complement of ʔayy(a) ‘which,’ as illus-
trated in (17).
(17)

‘Which patients did Nada visit?’
b. ʔayya marDaa zaarat-hum

‘Which patients did Nada visit?’
Other nominal wh-words like ˇsu/maaðaa ‘what,’ ʔaddee(ˇs) ‘how much,’ and
kam ‘how many’ are excluded from wh-questions involving resumptives, as evi-
denced by the unacceptability of the sentences in (18) from Lebanese Arabic and
(19) from Standard Arabic.
(18)

‘How many books did the students read?’

136
Modes of wh-interrogation
In particular, (18a) and (19a), which involve the wh-word ˇsu/maaðaa ‘what,’
contrast minimally with those in (20), which involve ʔayy(a) NP ‘which NP.’
With the resumptive element occurring in the variable position, the sentences in
(20) are acceptable.
(20)
a. ʔayya Sa¯hn Talabit-o
laila b-l-maTʕam?
which dish ordered.3fs-it Laila in-the-restaurant
‘Which dish did Laila order at the restaurant?’
b. ʔayya kitaabin ʔiˇstarat-hu
laila min al-maktabati?
which book
bought.3fs-it Laila from the-bookstore
‘Which book did Laila buy from the bookstore?’
All adverbial wh-words are excluded from resumptive wh-questions. This can
be clearly seen in contexts where the construction involving an adverbial wh-
word has a counterpart with ʔayya NP ‘which NP.’ The following sentences from
Lebanese Arabic illustrate this point.
(21)
a. ʔayya maTʕam rə¯htuu-l-o?
which restaurant went.2p-to-it
‘Which restaurant did you go to?’
b. *ween rə¯htuu-l-o?
where went.2p-to-it
‘Where did you go to?’
(22)
a. ʔayya nhaar xləSto
ﬁ-i
ˇs-ˇsəʁəl?
which day
ﬁnished.2p in-it the-work
‘Which day did you ﬁnish the work?’
b. *ʔeemta xləSto
ﬁ-i
ˇs-ˇsəʁəl?
when
ﬁnished.2p in-it the-work
‘When did you ﬁnish the work?’
When ween ‘where’ and ʔeemta ‘when’ are respectively replaced by ʔayya
maTʕam ‘which restaurant’ and ʔayya nhaar ‘which day,’ the use of a resumptive
element inside the sentence becomes perfectly acceptable.7
7 The contrast between ʔeemta ‘when’ and ʔayya nhaar ‘which day’ with respect to
their ability to occur in resumptive wh-interrogatives might be taken as an indication
that ʔeemta ‘when’ (and ween ‘where’) are non-nominal. Since resumptive elements in
Arabic only correspond to NPs, this would explain why these elements cannot be related
to resumptives in those languages. However, this explanation cannot extend to ˇsu ‘what,’
which is clearly a nominal wh-word, and is in contradiction with the fact that wh-words
like ʔeemta ‘when’ and ween ‘where’ can occur as complements of prepositions (see
footnote 2).

The pronominal clitics occur as resumptive elements in non-subject positions. In
subject positions, however, there is generally no pronoun in the variable position,
as evidenced by the following sentences from Lebanese Arabic (23) and Standard
Arabic (24) respectively:
(23)
a. ʔayya wleed
ʔəlto
ʔənno/-un rəb¯ho
l-ˇzeeyze
which children said.2p that/-they won.3p the-prize
‘Which children did you say that (they) won the prize?’
b. miin ʔəlto
ʔənn-o rəbi¯h
l-ˇzeeyze
who said.2p that/-he won.3ms the-prize
‘Who did you say that (he) won the prize?’
(24)
a. ʔayy-u
fataat-in ʕalim-tum ʔanna-*(ha) qad rabi¯hat
which-Nom girl-Gen learned-2p that-*(she)
prt. won.3fs
l-ˇzaaʔizata
the-prize-Acc
‘Which girl did you learn that she has won the prize?’
b. man ʕalim-tum ʔanna-*(hu) qad rabi¯ha
l-ˇzaaʔizata
who learned-2p that-*(he)
prt. won.3ms the-prize-Acc
‘Who did you learn that he has won the prize?’
Instead, we either ﬁnd the accusative clitic on the complementizer, as illustrated by
the examples from Lebanese Arabic and Standard Arabic in (23–24), or alterna-
tively, as in Lebanese Arabic, there is no pronominal element marking the variable
site. However, as can be noted in the Lebanese Arabic examples as well as in
the Standard Arabic examples, the verb in all cases bears the agreement features
that identify the wh-phrases as a subject. In fact, in verbless contexts, extraction
from subject positions without a resumptive clitic on the complementizer is not
acceptable:
(25)
a. ʔayya wleed
ʔəlto
ʔənn- *o/un b-l-beet
which children said.2p that-they
in-the-house
‘Which children did you say that they were at home?’
b. ʔayyu
ʔawlad-in
qult-um ʔanna- *Ø/hum ﬁ-l-bayt-i
which.Nom children-Gen said.2p that-they
in-the-house-Gen
‘Which children did you say that they were at home?’
In traditional analyses of subject–object asymmetries within the Principles and
Parameters approach, the required resumptive clitic on the complementizer in (25)
is due to a prohibition against having the complementizer be followed by a trace;
a typical that-t effect.

138
Modes of wh-interrogation
Brieﬂy, the gap and resumptive strategies in wh-question formation alternate
for miin/man ‘who’ and ʔayya NP ‘which NP’ when they are in non-subject posi-
tions. The gap strategy is the only strategy available for adverbial wh-words as
well as nominal ˇsu ‘what,’ kam NP ‘how many NP,’ and ʔadeeˇs ‘how much.’ The
resumptive strategy seems to be the only one available for questioning subjects
in Standard Arabic and Lebanese Arabic, an observation that can be attributed
to a that-t effect. This is evidenced in the sentences in (25). There is one note-
worthy difference between Lebanese Arabic and Standard Arabic, illustrated in
the contrast between (23) and (24), which might indicate that that-t effects are
stronger in Standard Arabic than they are in Lebanese Arabic: Standard Arabic,
unlike Lebanese Arabic, requires the resumptive clitic on the complementizer
even though the verbs in (23) and (24) bear agreement features that identify
the null resumptive pronominal. This difference between Standard Arabic and
Lebanese Arabic can be reduced to a difference between the two complementizers
ʔanna and ʔinno: the Standard Arabic complementizer ʔanna requires the spec-
iﬁer of the projection below it to be overtly realized. Thus, even in declarative
sentences, where no extraction takes place, ʔanna must be followed by a clitic
agreeing in person, gender, and number with the subject (26a) (see also chapter 2),
but this requirement seems to be waived if a PP is preposed to a preverbal
position (27).
(26)
a. samiʕtu ʔanna-*(hu) naˇza¯ha
Standard Arabic

‘I heard that he passed.’
b. smiʕt

‘I heard that she passed.’
(27)
samiʕtu ʔanna ﬁ-l-bayt-i
walad-un
Standard Arabic
heard.1s that
in-the-house-Gen child-Nom
‘I heard that in the house, there is a child.’
As indicated by the acceptability of (26b) from Lebanese Arabic, the com-
plementizer ʔinno does not require a pronominal clitic to follow it. Thus, the
difference between (23) and (24) is attributed to the fact that the speciﬁer of
the projection immediately dominated by ʔanna in Standard Arabic cannot be
empty, that is, it can be neither a trace of movement nor an empty pronominal
element.
The table below summarizes the facts that we are trying to generalize over.

6.3.1
Resumptive wh-interrogatives and d-linking
In the previous section, we surveyed the distribution of gaps and resump-
tives in wh-interrogatives and noted that there are constraints imposed on that
distribution. One constraint that we have touched upon and which we take up now
in detail is related to the nature of the A′-antecedent: we have already observed
that whereas all wh-words can be related to gaps, only ʔayy(a) NP ‘which NP’ and
miin/man ‘who’ are able to occur in resumptive wh-interrogatives. More specif-
ically, even nominal wh-words like ˇsu ‘what,’ or wh-phrases like kam NP ‘how
many NP,’ cannot be resumed by a clitic.
The parallel behavior of adverbial wh-phrases, like kiif ‘how’ and lee(ˇs) ‘why,’
and measure phrases, like kam NP ‘how many NP’ and ʔaddee(ˇs) ‘how much,’
with respect to wh-extraction is not surprising. This observation has been made
cross-linguistically (see Aoun 1986; Cinque 1990; Rizzi 1990). Thus, it is observed
that measure phrases in English, like adjunct wh-words, cannot be extracted from
a wh-island. The paradigm in (29–32) provides evidence for this generalization.
(29)
a. ?Which problem do you wonder how to solve it?
b. *How do you wonder which problem to solve it?
Examples (29a–b) are an illustration of the classic argument-adjunct asymme-
try: Whereas object extraction from a wh-island is marginally acceptable (29a),
extraction of an adverbial wh-phrase from a wh-island gives rise to strong unac-
ceptability in English. The same asymmetry is found in the context of selected
measure phrases, like 200lbs in (30b).
(30)
a. John weighed apples.
b. John weighed 200lbs.
(31)
?What did John wonder how to weigh?
(32)
What did John weigh?
An ambiguous verb like weigh can be agentive, taking a direct object complement,
as in (30a), or stative, selecting a measure phrase complement, as in (30b). Whereas
both types of complements can be questioned, as evidenced in the ambiguity
of (32), when what is extracted from a wh-island, as illustrated in (31), only

140
Modes of wh-interrogation
the agentive meaning survives and a question like (31) can only be felicitously
answered with “apples” and not with “200lbs.”
It is not clear, however, what brings adjuncts and measure phrases together with
ˇsu ‘what’ in not allowing resumption.8
One difference one can point out between ˇsu ‘what’ and ʔayya NP ‘which NP’
has been captured by the notion of membership in a presupposed set (see Kuroda
1968). In a discourse context, as in (33), where the speaker presents the hearer
with a choice between two books, the follow-up question must be one that involves
ʔayya NP ‘which NP,’ as indicated by the contrast between (34a) and (34b).
(33)
S: ﬁi

‘What do you want to read ﬁrst?’
b. ʔayya kteeb baddak
təʔra
b-l-ʔawwal?
which book want.2ms read.2ms in-the-ﬁrst
‘Which book do you want to read ﬁrst?’
ˇsu ‘what’ is unable to pick up a discourse referent as antecedent and therefore
(34a) is infelicitous in the context of the discourse in (33).
Thus, ˇsu ‘what’ cannot refer to a member of a presupposed set, whereas ʔayya
NP ‘which NP’ does. The notion of membership in a presupposed set is what
underlies the concept of referential noun phrase, developed in Cinque (1990) and
which is itself related to the notion of d-linking (Pesetsky 1987). Cinque (1990)
understands referential noun phrases to be noun phrases that are associated with a
presupposition of existence. A characteristic property of referential noun phrases
is that they can easily enter into coreference relations with pronouns in discourse:
(35)
a. ʔarrit
l-mʕallme
l-kteeb

ʔana
read.caus.3fs the-teacher.fs the-book to-the-students and I
kameen ʔriit-o
too
read-it
‘The teacher made the students read the book. And I too read it.’
8 The contrast between ˇsu/maaðaa ‘what’ and ʔayy(a) NP ‘which NP’ is reminiscent of
what can be observed in English long extraction (Kroch 1989):
(i)
a.? What were you wondering how to ﬁx e?
b. Which car were you wondering how to ﬁx e?
Whereas the extraction of what out of a wh-island is relatively unacceptable, the extraction
of a which-phrase is perfectly acceptable, as indicated in the contrast between (ia) and
(ib) above.

¯habbu-u
Neg. know.1s, but the-teacher.fs said.3fs that

‘I don’t know, but the teacher said that they didn’t like it.’
A deﬁnite noun phrase, an indeﬁnite noun phrase interpreted referentially, and
a which phrase can all be coreferent with a pronoun in discourse. Given this
deﬁnition, ˇsu ‘what’ is not a referential noun phrase, because it cannot enter into
coreference relations with a pronoun, as illustrated in (36).
(36)
*a: ˇsu

‘What did the students read?’

ʔənno ma
¯habbu-u
Neg. know.1s, but the-teacher.fs said.3fs that
Neg. like.3p-it
‘I don’t know, but the teacher said that they didn’t like it.’
A second and related difference between ˇsu ‘what’ and ʔayya NP ‘which NP’
is that, unlike ʔayya NP ‘which NP,’ ˇsu ‘what’ cannot participate in partitive
expressions:
(37)
a. *ˇsu
mn ha-l-kətub
what of
this-the-books
b. ʔayya waa¯had/kteeb mn ha-l-kətub
which one/book
of
this-the-books
‘Which one of these books.’
Partitivity is closely related to referentiality as deﬁned in Cinque (1990), as it
clearly signals membership in a presupposed set. Thus, an initial generalization
can be put forth to account for which wh-words can be related to resumptive
elements:
(38)
wh-phrases related to resumptive elements must be referential.

142
Modes of wh-interrogation
Despite the fact that the notion of referentiality characterizes accurately the
difference between ˇsu ‘what,’ ween ‘where,’ ʔeemta ‘when,’ and ʔayya NP ‘which
NP,’ it does not carry over to kam NP ‘how many NP.’
The possibility of a referential interpretation for kam NP ‘how many NP’ phrases
is documented in the literature (see among others, Heycock (1995), Fox (1999),
and references therein) and is clear in that those phrases, like ʔayya NP ‘which
NP’ phrases, can pick out a discourse referent (39):9
(39)
a. ﬁi
¯hakiim ʔalb, ¯hakiim sneen, ¯hakiim məʕde, ¯hakiim
in-it doctor heart doctor teeth
doctor stomach doctor
nəfseene.

‘There is a cardiologist, a dentist, an internal medicine specialist, and
a psychiatrist.’
b. kam
¯hakiim/waa¯had baddak
tˇsuuf?
how many doctor/one
want.2ms see.2ms
How many doctors/ones do you want to see?’
9 The referential reading of kam NP ‘how many NP’ can be identiﬁed with what the
literature has termed the presuppositional reading. Heycock (1995) clearly shows that
questions involving kam NP ‘how many NP’ are ambiguous between two readings: a
presuppositional reading and an amount reading. This ambiguity shows up when the
wh-phrase kam NP ‘how many NP’ co-occurs with other scope sensitive elements in the
sentence, as explained in Fox (1999). Consider the following sentence:
(i)
kam
Təbbax badda
tˇsaØØil
Nada b-l-maTʕam?
how many cook
want.3fs employ.3fs Nada in-the-restaurant
‘How many cooks does Nada want to hire for the restaurant?’
To distinguish between the two readings, Fox (1999) suggests interpreting the question
given the scenario in (ii). In such a context, the two different readings of (i) give rise to
two different answers.
(ii)
S1
Nada is opening a new restaurant in a few weeks and she wants to hire three
cooks to man the kitchen. After a long day of interviews she decides that she
wants to hire two of the cooks she has interviewed, leaving the task to hire the
third one for later.
The reading where kam Təbbax ‘how many cooks’ takes its scope below the verb badda
‘she wants’ – the non-referential reading – corresponds to the answer “three” in S1.
Under the interpretation where kam Təbbax ‘how many cooks’ takes its scope higher
than the verb badda ‘she wants’ – the referential reading – the answer to the question in
(i) is “two.” This reading corresponds to a presuppositional interpretation of the wh-noun
phrase. That is, what is being asked is how many of the cooks (that she has interviewed)
Nada wants to hire for the restaurant.

6.3 The gap strategy and the resumptive strategy
143
In the context of the discourse presented in (39a), when the addressee hears
the question in (39b), he or she is expected to respond by picking out a num-
ber of doctors from those listed by the speaker in the discourse in (39a), as
evidenced by the ability to use the pronominal form waa¯had ‘one.’ Thus, kam
NP ‘how many NP’ in (39b) is able to pick up its referent from the preceding
discourse.
Similarly, kam NP ‘how many NP’ can participate in partitive constructions
(40):
(40)
kam
kteeb mn hal-kətub
ʔriito?
how many book of
this-the-books read.2p
‘How many of these books did you read?’
Interestingly however, kam NP ‘how many NP’ phrases, unlike ʔayya NP ‘which
NP’ phrases, cannot be related to resumptive elements in wh-questions, as was
observed earlier. Thus, while all wh-phrases which can be related to resumptives
must be referential, i.e. miin ‘who’ and ʔayya NP ‘which NP,’ not all referential wh-
phrases can be related to a resumptive element. Thus, the notion of referentiality
is not sufﬁcient to pick out all the wh-phrases that participate in wh-questions
involving resumptives.10
6.3.2
The syntax of wh-constituents
The question can be raised now as to what ˇsu/maaðaa ‘what’ and kam
NP ‘how many NP’ have in common that distinguishes them from both ʔayy(a)
NP ‘which NP’ and miin/man ‘who.’ The proposal we would like to put forth is
summarized in (41).
(41)
a. Wh-phrases can be decomposed into two parts: (i) a wh-element,
which bears the question feature, and (ii) a noun phrase, which can
either be a full DP, or not.
b. Only those wh-phrases which are composed of a wh-element
co-occuring with a full DP can be related to a resumptive element.
Under this proposal, ʔayya NP ‘which NP’ and miin ‘who’ have the representation
in (42), whereas ˇsu ‘what’ and kam NP ‘how many NP’ have the representation
in (43).
10 We take up this issue again in chapters 7 and 8, where this generalization will be revised in
light of the distribution of resumption in restrictive relatives and in clitic-left dislocation
constructions.

144
Modes of wh-interrogation
(42)
miin/man/  ayy(a) 
Wh                
DP
(43)
Wh             NP 
Independent evidence suggests that this proposal is on the right track to dis-
tinguish between ʔayya ‘which’ and kam ‘how many.’ ʔayya ‘which’ can be
separated from the following noun phrase by a numerical element, whereas kam
‘how many’ cannot (44). This indicates that the complement of ʔayya ‘which’ is
more complex than that of kam ‘how many.’
(44)
a. ʔayya (tleet) wleed ʔiˇzo?
which (three) boys
came
‘Which three boys came?’
b. *kam
(tleet) wleed ʔiˇzo?
how many (three) boys
came
‘How many three boys came?’
In fact, the complement of kam ‘how many’ cannot be plural, as indicated by
the unacceptability of (44b), even when it doesn’t involve the numerical tleet(e)
‘three.’ The complement of kam can only be a singular count noun, indicating
that it is structurally simpler than the complement of ʔayya (44a), which can
be a quantiﬁed noun phrase or a plural noun phrase. Thus the generalization is
that:
(45)
Resumptive elements correspond to the full DP complement of wh.
6.3.3
Long-distance wh-dependencies and island sensitivity
Sentence initial wh-phrases can be related to a gap or a resumptive
element – when the latter is available – across clause boundaries. Sentences (46–
50) from Lebanese Arabic illustrate this generalization.
(46)

how much said.2p that

‘How much did you say you paid for the car to ﬁx it?’
As observed in (48–50), adverbial wh-phrases like ween ‘where’ and ʔeemta
‘when’ can be related to a gap across clause boundaries. These have been termed
referential adjuncts in the relevant literature, due to the fact that, in some languages,
there are pronouns that correspond to these wh-words. Thus, in English, then
and there correspond to when and where respectively. However, non-referential
adjunct wh-phrases like kiif ‘how’ or lee(ˇs)/laˇsu ‘why’ cannot be related to a gap
across clause boundaries, as evidenced by the unacceptability of the sentences
in (51).

In both (51a) and (51b) the sentence initial wh-word cannot be interpreted with
respect to the embedded verb. It is that interpretation that is starred in those
sentences.
As has been known since Ross (1967), wh-questions which involve gaps,
unlike those involving resumptive elements, obey island conditions. Thus,
we have a systematic contrast between wh-words related to gaps and
wh-words related to resumptives, when the gap or the resumptive occurs
inside an island. We have chosen to illustrate this observation in Lebanese
Arabic, using relative clause islands (52), wh-islands (53), and adjunct
clauses (54).

Whereas a wh-element in sentence initial position can be related to a resumptive
element inside a relative clause (52b), a wh-island (53b), or an adjunct clause (54b),
it cannot be related to a gap inside any of those islands.
6.3.4
Summary
This section has shed light on two systematic differences between gapped
wh-interrogatives and resumptive wh-interrogatives in Arabic: (1) the occurrence
of a resumptive pronominal inside a wh-interrogative is restricted to those con-
structions involving a wh-word that consists of a wh-feature with a full DP comple-
ment; (2) resumptive wh-interrogatives, but not gapped wh-interrogatives, violate
various island conditions. This fact has been taken as evidence that resumptive wh-
interrogatives, unlike gapped wh-interrogatives are not generated by movement
of the wh-phrase to the clause initial position. Thus resumptive wh-interrogatives
and gapped wh-interrogatives have been given the respective representations in
(55a) and (55b) to account for this difference.

Class II resumptive interrogatives
In addition to the conventional resumptive strategy for forming wh-
interrogatives, which requires the presence of a pronominal clitic in the variable
position to which the sentence initial wh-phrase is related, various Arabic dialects
make use of another resumptive strategy in forming wh-questions, which Shlon-
sky (2002) terms Class II interrogatives. The following sentences from Palestinian
Arabic (56a), Egyptian Arabic (56b), and Standard Arabic (56c) illustrate the
Class II resumptive strategy:11
11 Unless otherwise indicated, the Palestinian Arabic examples are from Shlonsky (2002)
and the Egyptian Arabic sentences are from Wahba (1984).

‘Who did you see in the restaurant?’
The two types of resumptive interrogative constructions share several properties.
First, both strategies can express an unbounded dependency between the wh-
element and the resumptive pronominal, as illustrated in (59) from Lebanese
Arabic, and (60) from Palestinian Arabic.

‘Which letter did Mona say that Mary thought that Faatme sent to

6.4 Class II resumptive interrogatives

Second, in both strategies questioning into an island is fully acceptable. This
observation is illustrated using relative clause islands (61–62), but can be extended
to wh-islands and adjunct clauses.12

binət ʔilli ˇsufti
l-ʔasad ʔilli ʔakal-ha?

‘Which girl did you see the lion that ate her?’
However, resumptive wh-interrogatives and Class II interrogatives differ in
important respects. The obvious and most noticeable difference between the two
strategies is the presence of the relativizer yalli/ʔilli/ʔallaði ‘that’ in Class II
interrogatives.
Another difference between the two types of wh-questions is the fact that ˇsu/ʔeh
‘what’ can participate in a Class II interrogative but cannot appear in a resumptive
wh-interrogative, as illustrated in the contrast in (63) in Lebanese Arabic:
(63)
a. *ˇsu
Talabət-o
laila b-l-maTʕam?
what ordered.3fs-it Laila in-the-restaurant
‘What did Laila order in the restaurant?’
12 Wahba (1984c) notes that in Class II interrogatives in Egyptian Arabic, the sentence
initial wh-word cannot be related to a resumptive clitic inside an island, as illustrated
in (i):
(i)
a. *ʔanhi kitaab illi
mona teʕraf
miin illi
saraʔ-uh?
which book
that Mona know.3fs who that stole.3ms-it
‘Which book does Mona know who stole it?’
b. *miin illi
mona teʕraf
feen
huwwa raa¯h?
who
that Mona know.3sf where he
went.3ms
‘Who does Mona know where he went?’
That is, in Egyptian Arabic, Class II interrogatives seem to behave like conventional gap
wh-interrogatives with respect to island sensitivity. It is interesting to note here that in
Egyptian Arabic, unlike in other Arabic dialects, wh-interrogatives with gaps are not a
default strategy (see also the discussion at the end of this section and in section 6.5).

b. ˇsu
yalli Talabət-o
laila b-l-maTʕam?
what that ordered.3fs-it Laila in-the-restaurant
‘What is it that Laila ordered in the restaurant?’
In addition, it can be noted that whereas miin/man ‘who’ induces default mascu-
line singular agreement features on the resumptive element that is directly related
to it, in Class II interrogatives, it can be related to a resumptive pronominal with
full number and gender agreement features, as illustrated in (64) from Lebanese
Arabic.
(64)
a. miin ʕazamu-u/*a/*un
ʕa-l-¯haﬂe?
who invited.3p-him/*her/*them to-the-party
‘Who did they invite to the party?’
b. miin yalli ʕazamu-u/a/un
ʕa-l-¯haﬂe?
Who that invited.3p-him/her/them to-the-party
‘Who is it that they invited to the party?’
Shlonsky (2002) notes a similar contrast in Moroccan Arabic, when questioning
a subject:
(65)
a. ˇskun mˇsa?
who left.3ms
‘Who left?’
b. *ˇskun mˇsat/mˇsaw?
who
left.3fs/3p
‘Who left?’
c. ˇskun lli
mˇsa/
mˇsat/
mˇsaw?
Who that left.3ms/ left.3fs/ left.3p
‘Who left?’
Thus, in a conventional gapped wh-interrogative, questioning the subject entails
that the verb appears with third person masculine singular (default) agreement
in Arabic; this is not the case in a Class II interrogative, as illustrated in
(65c).
The differences outlined above seem to suggest that the wh-word in Class
II interrogatives is not directly related to the resumptive pronominal inside the
sentence. That is, the resumptive element does not occupy the variable position
corresponding to the sentence initial wh-word. Shlonsky (2002) claims that, in
their structure, Class II interrogatives parallel identiﬁcational sentences where the
subject is wh-fronted, as can be seen by comparing (66a) and (66b), in Lebanese
Arabic.

6.4 Class II resumptive interrogatives
151
(66)
a. ˇsu
(huwwe) l-ʔakl
l-yom?

‘What is on the menu today?’
b. ˇsu
(huwwe) lli
ra¯h
teeklu-u l-yom?
what (he)
that fut.
eat.2p-it the-day
‘What is it that you are going to eat today?’
In both Class II interrogatives and identiﬁcational sentences, the “pronominal
copula” (Doron 1983) can appear, separating the subject from the predicate. In
such cases, the clause introduced by the complementizer (ya)lli ‘that’ (66b) is
analyzed as a free relative, like the ones in (67).13
(67)
a. salma bit¯hibb
lli
ra¯h teeklu-u l-yom
Lebanese Arabic
Salma likes.3fs that fut. eat.2p-it the-day
‘Salma likes what you will eat today.’
b. l-jnuud
Darabu ʔilli ¯habasu-u
Palestinian Arabic
the-army hit.3p
that arrested.3p-him
‘The army beat up the one they arrested.’
Shlonsky’s (2002) analysis of Class II interrogatives thus accounts for all the dif-
ferences that can be observed between those constructions and wh-interrogatives
involving resumption, namely, the presence of the relativizer in Class II inter-
rogatives, the acceptability of the Arabic equivalent of ‘what’ in those construc-
tions, and the agreement facts with miin/man/ˇskun ‘who.’ The clause headed by
lli/yalli/ʔilli ‘that’ is analyzed by Shlonsky (2002) as a predicate taking a null
pronominal as subject and Class II interrogatives are given the structure in (68).14
13 In addition to the agreement facts observed with Class II resumptive interrogatives
involving miin ‘who,’ the separability of the wh-word from the relativizer lli provides
evidence that the wh-word in those constructions is not the head of the relative construc-
tion. In fact, in restrictive relatives, the head cannot be separated from the relativizer by
a pronoun, as illustrated in the contrast between (ia) and (ib):
(i)
a. *ˇsift
l-walad
huwwe lli
xazzaʔ
l-kteeb
saw.1s the-child he
that tore.3ms the-book
‘I saw the child that tore up the book.’
b. miin huwwe lli
xazzaʔ
l-kteeb?
who he
that tore.3ms the-book
‘Who is it that tore up the book?’
14 See chapter 7 for a different analysis of the relativizer lli/yalli/ʔilli ‘that.’ Here we are
following Shlonsky (2002), where the relativizer is analyzed as a complementizer and
this aspect of the analysis does not affect the main points we are trying to make about
Class II interrogatives.

It is the null pronominal element pro in [Spec, DP] that agrees with the null
operator in [Spec, CP] and with the resumptive element inside the IP. This null
pronominal can sometimes be overtly realized as a strong pronoun, as seen
in (69).
(69)
a. miin hiyye lli

‘Who did the lion bite yesterday?’
b. miin hi
ʔilli l-ʔasad ʔakal-ha
mbaari¯h?
Palestinian Arabic
who she that the-lion ate.3ms-her yesterday
‘Who did the lion eat yesterday?’
Thus, it seems that resumptive wh-interrogatives and Class II interrogatives
are the result of different derivations. They share only a dependency between a
wh-word and a resumptive pronominal, but the two constructions differ greatly
in how the relation is established between the wh-word and the resumptive. In
wh-interrogatives, the resumptive element is directly bound by the wh-word, as
a variable is by its corresponding operator. In Class II interrogatives, the relation
between the wh-word and the resumptive pronominal is mediated by two pred-
ication relations: the ﬁrst between the null pronominal head of the free relative
and the relative CP headed by the relativizer and the second between the two DPs
forming the identiﬁcational sentence.
Cross-linguistic examination of the two types of resumptive wh-interrogatives
provides independent evidence for a separation between the two constructions. In
fact Egyptian Arabic uses Class II interrogatives as a common strategy for question
formation. All nominal wh-words can enter into this construction in Egyptian
Arabic, with the properties discussed earlier in the section (see, however, footnote
12). However, Egyptian Arabic does not make use of the conventional resumptive

6.5 wh-in-situ
153
strategy in forming wh-interrogatives. This is illustrated in the following contrasts
provided in Wahba (1984):
(70)
a. miin illi mona ˇsaaﬁt-uh?
who that Mona saw.3fs-him
‘Who did Mona see?’
b. *miin mona ˇsaaﬁt-uh?
who
Mona saw.3fs-him
‘Who did Mona see?’
(71)
a. ʔanhi walad illi mona ˇsaaﬁt-uh?
which boy
that Mona saw.3fs-him
‘Which boy did Mona see?’
b. *ʔanhi walad mona ˇsaaﬁt-uh?
which boy
Mona saw.3fs-him
‘Which boy did Mona see?’
The facts in (70) and (71) further conﬁrm that the two resumptive strategies must
be independently available in Universal Grammar.
The analysis defended by Shlonsky (2002) makes predictions regarding long
extraction in Class II interrogatives that are borne out. In such contexts, extraction
of the wh-phrase from an island is prohibited, as the unacceptability of (72a) in
Palestinian Arabic and (72b) in Lebanese Arabic indicates.
(72)
a. *miin ma
ʕrift-ˇs
weenta (hi)
ʔilli l-ʔasad ʔakal-ha
who
Neg know.2ms-Neg when
(she) that the-lion ate.3ms-her
‘Who didn’t you know when the lion ate?’
b. *miin ma
ʕrəfət
ʔeemta (hiyye) lli
l-ʔasad ʔakal-a
who
Neg know.2ms when
(she)
that the-lion ate.3ms-her
‘Who didn’t you know when the lion ate?’
Whereas in Class II interrogatives the wh-phrase cannot be extracted from inside
a wh-island, we have already observed that, in conventional resumptive wh-
interrogatives, the sentence initial wh-phrase can be related to a resumptive element
embedded within an island.
6.5
wh-in-situ
Having discussed the three strategies of wh-question formation that
involve sentence initial wh-words, we now turn to the fourth strategy: the in-situ
strategy. In-situ wh-questions have the wh-word occur in the position where we

154
Modes of wh-interrogation
would normally see a non-wh lexical noun phrase. The following sentences from
Lebanese Arabic and Egyptian Arabic (Wahba 1984) illustrate this observation:
(73)
Lebanese Arabic
a. ¯hkiito
maʕ miin l-yom?
talked.2p with who the-day
‘You talked with whom today?’
b. ¯hkiito
maʕ saami l-yom

‘You talked with Sami today.’
(74)

b. xabbarto ha-l-walad

‘How many kilometers is the distance between Beirut and Tripoli?’
b. btibʕud

‘Beirut is a hundred kilometers away from Tripoli.’
(76)

‘What did Mona forget to write?’
b. mona nisit

‘Mona forgot to write the letter.’
6.5.1
The distribution of wh-words in situ
In some dialects of Arabic, there are restrictions on which wh-words
participate in in-situ wh-questions. Furthermore, the restrictions vary from one
dialect to another. In Lebanese Arabic, there is a major division between nominal
and adverbial wh-phrases: adverbial wh-phrases generally cannot stay in situ. In

6.5 wh-in-situ
155
fact, they can marginally appear in situ in simplex clauses (77), but only referential
adverbial wh-phrases can appear in embedded contexts (78).
(77)
a.? ra¯h tnaymu-u
ween?
fut sleep.2p-him where
‘Where are you going to put him to sleep?’
b.? fall
lee?
left.3ms why
‘Why did he leave?’
c.? Salla¯hti-i
kiif?
ﬁxed.2fs-it how
‘How did you ﬁx it?’
(78)
a. ftakarto
ʔənno ra¯h ynaymu-u
ween?
thought.2p that
fut sleep.3p-him where
‘Where did you think they were going to put him to sleep?’
b. *ftakarto
ʔənno fall
lee?
thought.2p that

‘Why did you think he left?’
c. *ftakaro
ʔənno Salla¯hti-i
kiif?
thought.3p that
ﬁxed.2fs-it how
‘How did they think you ﬁxed it?’
As can be seen in (78b–c), the non-referential adverbial wh-words kiif ‘how’ and
lee(ˇs) ‘why’ cannot appear in situ in embedded contexts. Unlike adverbial wh-
phrases, nominal wh-phrases like miin ‘who,’ ʔayya NP ‘which NP,’ kam NP ‘how
many NP,’ and ʔaddee(ˇs) ‘how much’ can be found in situ in embedded contexts
in Lebanese Arabic (79).
(79)
a. ftakaro
ʔənno ¯hkiito
maʕ miin l-yom?
thought.3p that
talked.2p with who the-day
‘They thought that you talked with whom today?’
b. ftakaro

d. btiʕtiʔdo ʔənno dafaʕ
ʔaddee(ˇs) ¯haʔʔ s-siyyaara?
think.2p that
paid.3ms how much price the-car
‘How much do you think he paid for the car?’
However, ˇsu ‘what’ cannot be found in situ, neither in simplex contexts (80a) nor
in embedded contexts (80b).
(80)
a. *ˇstriito
ˇsu
mn-l-ma¯hall?
bought.2p what from-the-store
‘You bought what from the store?’
b. *byiftikro ʔənno ˇstriito
ˇsu
mn-l-ma¯hall?
think.3p
that
bought.2p what from-the-store
‘They think that you bought what from the store?’
It is interesting to note here that the set of wh-phrases that can occur in situ
does not match the set of wh-phrases that can be related to resumptive elements:
it contains it. The set of wh-phrases that occur in situ consists of the nominal
wh-phrases: miin ‘who,’ ʔayya NP ‘which NP,’ kam NP ‘how many NP,’ and
ʔaddee(ˇs) ‘how much.’ The set of wh-words that can be directly related to a
resumptive pronominal excludes the measure wh-phrases kam NP ‘how many NP’
and ʔadde(ˇs) ‘how much.’
Putting ˇsu ‘what’ on the side, we can observe a parallelism between wh-
extraction and wh-in-situ: the contrast observed between non-referential adverbial
wh-words and referential adverbial wh-words with respect to long-distance extrac-
tion is found again in in-situ contexts. What distinguishes in-situ wh-interrogatives
from gapped wh-interrogaives in Lebanese Arabic is that the former cannot appear
in a discourse out of the blue. Thus consider the minimally contrasting sentences
in (81):
(81)
a. ʔe, miin ˇsəfto
l-yom?
yes who saw.2p the-day
‘So, who did you see today?’
b. ʔe, ˇsəfto
miin l-yom?
yes saw.2p who the-day
‘So, who did you see today?’
Whereas (81a) can be uttered as a conversation opening, (81b) cannot be uttered in
such a context. Example (81b) presupposes the existence of a previous discourse
in which the speaker has an indication that his or her addressees met some people
on the day in question. Example (81b) is a question about the identity of those
people. Therefore one can say that (81b) presupposes the truth of the assertion
A = ‘you saw someone today.’

6.5 wh-in-situ
157
Finally, the wh-in-situ strategy does not have the same properties in all Arabic
dialects. We have already observed that Egyptian Arabic uses the in-situ strategy
as a default strategy for question formation. Furthermore, Egyptian Arabic puts no
restrictions on which wh-words can appear in situ. Thus, unlike Lebanese Arabic,
Egyptian Arabic allows its adverbial wh-words to appear in situ in simplex (82),
as well as complex wh-interrogatives (83).15
(82)

kull
yom?

‘Where does Sami go every day?’
b. saami ¯hayruu¯h

‘Where does Zeinab think Sami went?’
b. zeinab fakra
saami ra¯h
ʔimta?
Zeinab thinking.fs Sami went.3ms when
‘When does Zeinab think Sami left?’
15 The data in (82–83), obtained from our informant, seem to contradict the data in Wahba
(1984), where it is claimed that wh-in-situ phrases cannot occur in tensed subordinate
clauses (i).
(i)
a. Fariid ¯hawil

Fariid tried.3ms do.3ms what
‘What did Fariid try to do?’
b. *Fariid iftakar
inn mona ishtarit/bitishtiri/¯hatishtiri ʔeh?
Fariid
thought.3ms that Mona bought/buys/will buy
what
‘What did Fariid think that Mona bought/buys/will buy?’
However, all the data Wahba (1984) uses to illustrate this point include the use of inn
‘that,’ the declarative complementizer, which might itself block extraction.

d. tiftikri
byitbuxu l-muluxiya
ʔizzay?
think.2fs cook.3p the-mulukhiya how
‘How do you think they cook the mulukhiya?’
In addition, in Egyptian Arabic ʔeh ‘what’ (the equivalent of Lebanese Arabic ˇsu)
is allowed to appear in situ, in simplex (84a) and complex (84b) wh-questions:
(84)
a. saami ¯hayiˇstiri
ʔeh?
Sami buy.fut.3ms what
‘What will Sami buy?’
b. tiftikri
saami ¯hayiˇstiri
ʔeh?
think.2fs Sami buy.fut.3ms what
‘What do you think Sami will buy?’
A crucial difference between Egyptian Arabic and Lebanese Arabic in-situ
wh-interrogatives is that those constructions in Egyptian Arabic do not carry a
presuppositional meaning and can be uttered out of the blue, as the following
greeting illustrates:
(85)
ʕamla
ʔeh?
doing.fs what?
‘How are you doing?’
In effect, Egyptian Arabic does not seem to make extensive use of the gapped
wh-interrogatives as a default strategy. While Wahba (1984) reports of several
instances of wh-questions involving gaps (86) (generally involving an adverbial
wh-word), some native speakers of Egyptian Arabic point out that these sentences
sound like translations from Standard Arabic.
(86)

6.5.2
Summary and analysis
In this section we have tried to answer the following two basic questions
about wh-in-situ interrogatives: (a) which wh-words can remain in situ in Ara-
bic? and (b) what is the distribution of wh-in-situ elements in those languages?
The answers to those questions vary across the various dialects of Arabic. Thus,

6.5 wh-in-situ
159
Standard Arabic does not allow wh-words to remain in situ (except in very
restricted contexts16), whereas Egyptian Arabic allows all its wh-words to remain
in situ in all contexts. In Lebanese Arabic, the picture looks a bit more compli-
cated. All nominal wh-words can remain in situ, except for ˇsu ‘what.’ Adverbial
wh-words are split along the “referentiality” dimension: what is referred to as
referential adverbial wh-words can remain in situ in simplex as well as com-
plex sentences, whereas non-referential adverbial wh-words are only marginally
acceptable in simplex sentences. We have noted that this distinction between non-
referential and referential adverbial wh-words is also relevant in the context of the
long-distance extraction of wh-words.17
Aoun and Li (1993a) propose and argue for an analysis that provides an answer
to the ﬁrst question regarding the nature of the wh-words that may occur in situ.
They suggest that wh-words can be classiﬁed as either operators or variables. The
former need to undergo movement in the syntax, and this is the case in English;
the latter can remain in situ, which is the case in Chinese. The authors further note
that in Chinese, wh-words can also function as variables in non-question contexts,
as illustrated in (87).
(87)
a. Ta gen shei
shuohua ma?
he with whom speak
Q
‘Did he speak with someone?’
b. Shenme ta dou yao.
what
he all
want
‘He wants everything.’
c. Ta bu xihuan shenme
he not like
what
‘He does not like anything.’
16 One such context is the scholastic context where a teacher is eliciting answers from
pupils, as illustrated below:
(i)
yaqraʔu
l-walad-u
maaðaa?
reads.3ms the-boy-Nom what
‘What does the boy read?’
17 The distinction made between referential and non-referential adverbial wh-words was
said to hold in English since when and where have non-wh pronominal counterparts
in then and there respectively. Interestingly, however, in Lebanese Arabic, where the
same contrast holds between referential and non-referential adverbial wh-words, it is
ween ‘where,’ leeˇs/laˇsu ‘why,’ and kiif ‘how’ that have corresponding non-wh pronouns:
hon/honik ‘here/there’ and heek ‘like this/for that reason.’ Thus, although we continue
to use the terms “referential” and “non-referential,” we cannot say that we subscribe to
the analysis that underlies it.

160
Modes of wh-interrogation
In (87a), the wh-word has an existential reading induced by the yes-no question
context, in (87b) it has a universal reading induced by the presence of dou, a
quantiﬁcational particle, and in (87c) it has a negative polarity reading. The wh-
words in (87) are basically indeﬁnite noun phrases bound to an operator. This is
not the case for English wh-words, which cannot occur in any of the contexts in
(87).
Ouhalla (1996) points out an empirical and a conceptual drawback in Aoun and
Li’s analysis of wh-in-situ. First, Iraqi Arabic – and we might add other dialects
of Arabic (like Egyptian Arabic and Lebanese Arabic) – allows its wh-words to
occur in situ, even though, as in English, none of them can function as variables
in the contexts in (87). Thus, wh-words need not be used as indeﬁnite NPs in
order for them to occur in in-situ contexts. On a more conceptual level, Ouhalla
points out that the ability an NP has to be a bound variable has no relation to its
inherent properties. That is, almost all NP types, ranging from anaphors in (88a)
to demonstrative NPs (88d), can function as bound variables.
(88)
a. Who loves himself?
b. Who thinks he is a genius?
c. Which boy’s mother thinks the bastard is a genius?
d. Every professor thinks that that professor deserves a raise.
Ouhalla (1996) proposes an alternative analysis which can be outlined as follows:
(89)
a. There are two types of wh-words: the bare type and the compound
type. The compound type shows overt phi-features.
b. Bare wh-words are long distance A′-anaphors whereas compound
wh-pronouns are local A′-anaphors.
The assumption in (89a) describes the difference between English or Chinese
wh-words on one hand, and those in Iraqi Arabic on the other. Thus, in Iraqi
Arabic one observes the occurrence of an overt pronominal element on wh-words
such as ˇsen-o ‘what’ and men-o ‘who.’ Those are termed compound wh-words.
In English, this pronominal element is assumed to be covert, as who and what
do not show overt phi-features. They are therefore termed bare wh-words. The
assumption in (89b) accounts for the distribution of wh-words in situ and for some
observed cross-linguistic differences. Thus, in Chinese, where the wh-words do
not bear overt phi-features, wh-words in situ appear inside tensed clauses and

The bare wh-word in Chinese can be bound by a [+wh] complementizer across a

Given either one of the two analyses outlined above, it remains difﬁcult to explain
the range of facts we observe in the other dialects of Arabic. In fact, in Ouhalla’s
analysis, the fact that some languages (like Standard Arabic) do not allow any
of their wh-words to remain in situ remains unexplained. Under Aoun and Li’s
assumption that wh-elements in situ need to occur as variables in contexts like
(87) that are different from wh-questions, the contrast between Lebanese Arabic
and Standard Arabic remains unexplained: in both languages the wh-words cannot
occur in the contexts in (87), yet Lebanese Arabic makes use of wh-in-situ, but
Standard Arabic doesn’t. In Egyptian Arabic, where wh-words also do not occur
as variables in the contexts in (87), the wh-in-situ strategy is the default strategy
for forming questions. It is clear at this point that more work needs to be done in
order to be able to give a general answer to the questions we put forth at the outset
of this summary.
6.6
Conclusion
In this chapter we have examined the properties of A′-dependencies in
wh-interrogatives. Starting from the observation that the various Arabic dialects
make use of four different strategies to form wh-interrogatives, we investigated
the characteristics of those strategies, with respect to island sensitivity and the
nature of the wh-constituent that they involve.
A major distinction between gapped wh-interrogatives and the other three types
of questions is that there are no restrictions on the type of wh-constituent that can
occur in a gapped wh-interrogative. In addition, whereas gapped wh-interrogatives
are sensitive to islands, resumptive wh-interrogatives are not. We also observed that

162
Modes of wh-interrogation
the sets of wh-constituents that enter into resumptive interrogatives and Class II
resumptive interrogatives are not the same. Thus, whereas ˇsu ‘what’ (in Lebanese
Arabic, and its equivalents in other modern varieties of Arabic) is prohibited
in resumptive interrogatives, it is allowed to occur in Class II resumptive inter-
rogatives. We discussed possible accounts for the restriction on the type of wh-
constituent that can be related to a resumptive and concluded that referentiality
(however deﬁned) does not present an adequate answer: amount (quantiﬁed) wh-
words cannot be related to resumptives in wh-questions, although they can have
a referential reading. Finally, the wh-in-situ strategy varies across the Arabic
dialects, not only in its availability, but also in terms of the nature of the wh-word
that can occur in situ. In Egyptian Arabic, the in-situ strategy is the default strategy
for forming questions and all wh-words can occur in situ. In Lebanese Arabic, on
the other hand, that is not the case. The set of wh-words that can occur in situ in
Lebanese Arabic does not coincide with the set of wh-words that can be related to
a resumptive pronoun.

Restrictive relatives

Introduction
In the previous chapter, we focused on the different strategies for form-
ing wh-interrogatives in Arabic and on their different syntactic and interpretive
properties. We discussed the properties of long-distance dependencies between
sentence initial wh-words and their corresponding positions within the sentence.
We observed that the relationship between a wh-word and its corresponding gap
within the sentence is sensitive to islands, whereas this wasn’t the case for the
relationship between a wh-word and its corresponding resumptive element. Fur-
thermore, we observed that the resumptive strategy puts restrictions on the nature
of the wh-antecedent, such that only wh-words that correspond to a DP can
be related to a resumptive element. It is also the case that all wh-words that
can be related to a resumptive element are referential, in the sense deﬁned by
Cinque (1990).
This chapter focuses on restrictive relative constructions in Arabic. In restrictive
relative clause formation, it is the resumptive strategy that is the default strategy.
Although gaps can be found in restrictive relatives in Arabic, their distribution is
restricted in various dialects. This allows us to investigate further the properties
of resumption. It will turn out that there are contexts where resumption shares
characteristics of gap constructions in being sensitive to island conditions, and
that referentiality does not adequately constrain the set of possible antecedents of
a resumptive pronoun. In addition, the chapter introduces a new classiﬁcation of
restrictive relatives in terms of the deﬁniteness of the antecedent (relativized head)
that plays a signiﬁcant role in the syntax of those constructions.
7.2
Two types of relative clauses
Restrictive relative clauses in Arabic fall into two categories: restrictive
relatives with a deﬁnite relativized DP (deﬁnite relatives) and restrictive relatives
with an indeﬁnite relativized DP (indeﬁnite relatives).
163

164
Restrictive relatives
Deﬁnite relatives always occur with the complementizer allaði:
(1)
a. Daaʕa
l-kitaabu *(allaði) ˇstaraytu-hu l-baari¯hata
lost.3ms the-book that
bought.1s-it yesterday
‘The book that I bought yesterday is lost.’
b. Turida
l-waladu *(allaði) mazzaqa l-kitaaba
expelled.3ms the-child that
tore.3ms the-book
‘The boy that tore up the book was expelled.’
Indeﬁnite relatives on the other hand cannot occur with allaði; as a matter of
fact, indeﬁnite relatives have no complementizer:
(2)
a. ʔufattiˇsu ʕan kitaabin (*allaði) ʔaDaʕtu-hu l-yawma
look.1s
for book
that
lost.1s-it
the-day
‘I am looking for a book that I lost today.’
b. Taradat

expelled.3fs the-teacher.fs girl
that
hit.3fs
student
in
S-Safﬁ
the-class
‘The teacher expelled a girl that hit a student in the class.’
The complementizer allaði is speciﬁc to relative constructions. As observed in
chapter 2, sentential complements in Arabic are introduced by ʔanna or ʔan, as
illustrated below:
(3)
ʕaadat
l-bintu allati/*ʔan(na) Øaabat
ʕan
returned.3fs the-girl that
was-absent.3fs from
S-Safﬁ
l-bari¯hata
the-class yesterday
‘The girl that was absent from class yesterday returned.’
(4)
a. qaalat
l-muʕallimatu ʔanna/*allati l-binta Øaaʔibatun
said.3fs the-teacher.fs that
the-girl absent.fs
‘The teacher said that the girl was absent.’
b. turiidu
l-muʕallimatu ʔan/*allati tufassira
darsa t-taariixi
want.3fs the-teacher.fs that
explain.3fs lesson the-history
‘The teacher wants to explain the history lesson.’

7.2 Two types of relative clauses
165
This state of affairs is found across the Arabic dialects.1 What uniﬁes the two types
of relatives is that they are both generally formed with the resumptive strategy: in
constructions with deﬁnite relatives and indeﬁnite relatives, the relativized DP is
generally related to a resumptive element that occurs within the relative clause.
In non-subject positions,2 the resumptive element is always realized as a clitic (or
weak pronoun) (1a) and (2a). Arabic being a null-subject language, it comes as no
surprise that there is no overt pronominal in (1b) and (2b) marking the relativized
site in subject position (see also chapter 3). As we have observed in the case of
wh-interrogatives, the agreement morpheme on the verb may be taken to identify
the null pronominal element that serves as a resumptive pronoun in the cases of
relativization from subject position.
1 Ouhalla (2004) capitalizes on this difference between relative clauses and sentential
complements and argues for two types of relative clauses: the CP-type, found in English
and Hebrew, which uses the same complementizer in sentential complements and rel-
ative clauses, and the DP-type, found in Semitic, where the relativizer, a nominal
element akin to the deﬁnite determiner, is different from the sentential complement
complementizer.
2 These non-subject positions include complements of verbs as well as complements of
prepositions (i) or nouns (ii).
(i)
a. wajadtu kitaaban ʔaxbarat-ni ʕan-hu laila
Standard Arabic
found.1s book
told.3fs-me about-it Laila
ﬁ-l-ʕilliyati
in-the-attic
‘I found a book that Laila told me about in the attic.’
b. ˇstarayt

Lebanese Arabic

‘I bought the book that you talked about yesterday.’
(ii)
a. ˇstarayt

yalli btaʕrfe

Lebanese Arabic

‘I bought the book that you know its author.’

taʕrifu
ʔibnu-hu laila
Standard Arabic
met.1p
on
director.ms know.3fs son-his
Laila
‘We met a director that Laila knows his son.’
We will illustrate our generalizations using constructions with accusative resump-
tive clitics. However, these generalizations hold true of resumptive clitics which are
complements of prepositions and nouns as well.

Restrictive relatives
7.3
The gap strategy in restrictive relatives
The various Arabic dialects differ in whether they allow gaps in restrictive
relatives. In Modern Standard Arabic, gaps are allowed in object positions of
deﬁnite relatives:
(5)
a. al-kitaabu allaði sayaˇstari
saami mawˇzudun ﬁ-l-maktabati
the-book
that
buy.fut.3ms Sami exist.ms
in-the-bookstore
‘The book that Sami will buy is found at the bookstore.’
b. raʔaytu l-law¯hata
allati qulta
ʔanna-ka
sataˇstari
saw.1s the-painting that
said.2ms that-you.ms buy.fut.2ms
‘I saw the painting that you said that you will buy.’
Interestingly, Standard Arabic as well as the other dialects of Arabic that allow
gaps in restrictive relatives make exclusive use of resumption in indeﬁnite relatives.
Thus, the sentence in (5b) contrasts with the one in (6).
(6)
raʔaytu law¯hatan qulta
ʔanna-ka
sataˇstari-*(ha)
saw.1s painting said.2ms that-you.ms buy.fut.2ms-*(it)
‘I saw a painting that you said that you will buy.’
In some Arabic dialects, such as Lebanese Arabic, gaps are only allowed in
the subject position of existential constructions,3 or in adjunct positions (Choueiri
2002). Thus, consider the following sentences:
(7)
a. (kəll) l-kətub
lli
keen ﬁi
ʕa-T-Taawle Saaro
(all)
the-books that was
in-it on-the-table become.3p
ʕa-r-raff
hallaʔ
on-the-shelf now
‘(All) the books that there were on the table are now on the shelf.’
3 Carlson (1977) refers to those types of constructions with the name amount relatives
(AR). However, as Grosu and Landmann (1998) point out, those relative clauses that
involve relativization of the subject of existential constructions do not always have an
amount reading (i).
(i)
I took with me every book that there was on the table.
The sentence in (i) does not mean that the speaker took as many books (from the library)
as there were books (on the kitchen table). In the Lebanese Arabic sentences given in the
text, an amount reading does not adequately describe the interpretation of the sentences
either. Those sentences imply an identity of substance (the actual objects) as well as an
identity of amounts. We will therefore abandon the term amount relative in the text.

7.3 The gap strategy in restrictive relatives
167
b. ˇzammaʕt
(kəll) l-kətub
lli
ʕam tʔuulo ʔənno keen
collected.1s (all)
the-books that Asp. say.2p that
was
ﬁi
ʕa-T-Taawle
in-it on-the-table
‘I collected (all) the books that you are saying that there were on the
table.’
First, it must be noted that neither the particle ﬁi (lit. ‘in it’) nor the PP predicate
‘on the table’ bear the necessary agreement features to identify a null subject
pronoun (see chapter 3). We can then say that the relativized site in (7) clearly
corresponds to a gap.4
Similarly, adjunct relatives expressing time provide further evidence that gaps
are indeed involved in relativization in Lebanese Arabic.5
4 This conclusion is further conﬁrmed by the fact that whereas a strong pronoun may
optionally appear in the context of pro-drop, as illustrated in (i), it cannot appear in the
sentences involving relativization of the subject of an existential construction (ii):
(i)
ˇzamʕiyyit
S-Saliib

hdiyye la-l-¯hakiime
lli

S-Sa¯haaﬁyye ʔənno (hiyye) seeʕadit
l-ˇzar¯ha
said.3p the-reporters that
(she)
helped.3fs the-wounded
‘The organization of the Red Cross presented a gift to the doctor that the
reporters said that (she) helped the wounded.’
(ii)
a. (kəll) l-kətub
lli
ʕam tʔuulo ʔənno keen ﬁi
(all)
the-books that Asp. say.2p that
was in-it
(*hənne) ʕa-T-Taawle leezim yin¯haTTo ʕa-r-raff
(*them)

on-the-shelf
‘(All) the books that you are saying that there were (them) on the table
should be put on the shelf.’
b. ˇzammaʕt
(kəll) l-kətub
lli
ʕam tʔuulo ʔənno keen ﬁi
collected.1s (all)
the-books that Asp. say.2p that
was in-it
(*hənne) ʕa-T-Taawle
(*them)
on-the-table
‘I collected (all) the books that you are saying that there were (them) on the
table.’
The subject position of existential constructions triggers deﬁniteness effects and since
personal pronouns are deﬁnite, the unacceptability of the sentences in (ii) with a resump-
tive strong pronoun is not surprising.
5 Larson (1985) observes, for English, that the headed relative clauses that have a trace in
an adjunct position instead of a stranded preposition or a relative adverb are those whose
head belongs to the class of bare-NP adverbs, NPs that can function adverbially without
an accompanying preposition. This generalization also accounts for the difference that can

bitballiˇs
l-musiiʔa
fut. arrive.1p to-the-party hour that begin.3fs the-music
‘We will arrive at the party the time that the music begins.’
In addition to cases like (8), a gap can occur in an embedded clause within the
relative clause (9).
(9)

‘We will come to the party at the time that you are convinced that the
music should begin.’
In (9a), the time adjunct seeʕa(-t) ‘hour’ can easily modiﬁy the higher verb btiftikro
‘you think’ inside the relative clause: under that reading, the time of arrival to the
party coincides with the time the hearers think the music will begin, and not the
time when the music will actually begin. The latter interpretation – which implies
that the adjunct modiﬁes the lower verb bitballiˇs ‘begins’ – is only available
in the absence of the complementizer ʔənno ‘that.’ When the embedding verb
does not allow complementizer deletion, as in (9b) btiʔtinʕo ‘you are convinced,’
the reading that is readily available is the one where the adjunct modiﬁes the
higher verb: the time of arrival to the party coincides with the time the hearers
are convinced that the music should start. This is what the double question marks
indicate in (9b).
be noted between relativized time adverbs and relativized manner adverbs in Lebanese
Arabic. Only the former can occur as bare NPs:
(i)
a. wəSlo
(bi-) seeʕət-(h)a
arrived.3p (in-) hour-this
‘They arrived at this hour.’
b. wəSlo
(ʕa-) s-seeʕa
ʕaˇsra
arrived.3p (on-) the-hour ten
‘They arrived at ten.’

7.4 Gapped relatives and island sensitivity
169
Thus, the distribution of gaps in deﬁnite restrictive relatives in Arabic is
restricted: although the gap strategy is not the default strategy for forming restric-
tive relatives in Arabic, some dialects of Arabic do make use of gaps in those
constructions. In Standard Arabic, the gap strategy alternates with the resumptive
strategy in direct object positions. In Lebanese Arabic, for instance, the gap strat-
egy is the only strategy available for relativization from adjunct positions and the
subject position of existential constructions.
7.4
Gapped relatives and island sensitivity
Like other A′-constructions involving gaps, gapped relatives in Arabic
show island sensitivity. Thus, in Standard Arabic, a gap cannot occur in object
position if the relativized site is within an adjunct clause (10), a relative clause
(11), or a wh-island (12).

Similarly, in Lebanese Arabic, a gap that corresponds to the subject of an existential

In time adjunct relatives, the distribution of the gap is sensitive to islands as
well, as can be seen in the Lebanese Arabic examples in (14).

7.4 Gapped relatives and island sensitivity
171
The sentences in (14), which illustrate the relativization of the time adjunct
seeʕa ‘hour’ from various island contexts, are acceptable only under the reading
where the adjunct modiﬁes the higher verb inside the relative. The reading that
forces the time adjunct to be construed with the verb inside the relative clause
island is unavailable. This shows that time adjunct relatives are indeed sensitive
to islands.
If sensitivity to islands is taken as an indication for movement in syntax (Chom-
sky 1977), then we can say that gapped restrictive relatives in Arabic, like wh-
interrogatives involving gaps, are generated by movement in the syntax. That
is, the relationship between the gap and its antecedent in the relative clause
is a relation created by movement.6 Thus the representation of restrictive rel-
atives below corresponds to that of wh-interrogatives involving gaps given in
chapter 6:
(15)
relativized NPi . . . . . . . . . tracei
In the representation in (15), it appears that the relationship between the relativized
noun phrase and the trace within the sentence is direct. That is, the trace of
movement in (15) is that of the relativized noun phrase itself. This representation
thus corresponds to what has been called the “raising” analysis of restrictive
relatives. The “raising” analysis has been advocated by several researchers in the
ﬁeld and more recently by Kayne (1994), and it has been discussed in the context of
Semitic restrictive relatives in Choueiri (2002) and Ouhalla (2004). An alternative
analysis for restrictive relatives is the one argued for in Chomsky (1977), which
involves the movement of a null operator coindexed with the relativized noun
phrase, as illustrated in (16).
(16)
Relativized NPi -Opi . . . . . . tracei
In (16), the relation between the relativized noun phrase and the trace is mediated
by a predication relation, which results in the coindexation of the relativized
noun phrase and the null operator Op. The data discussed so far conform to both
representations in (15–16).
Having discussed the distribution of gaps within restrictive relatives in Arabic,
we now turn to the discussion of the default strategy for forming restrictive relatives
in Arabic: the resumptive strategy.
6 The relationship between the gap and resumptive strategies and movement is further
elaborated on in chapter 9. See also Shlonsky (1992) for a discussion of movement and
resumption in the context of restrictive relatives in Hebrew and Arabic.

Descriptively, a weak resumptive element may appear inside Arabic
restrictive relatives in all positions except subject positions and adjunct posi-
tions. Illustrative examples of restrictive relatives with weak resumptive pronouns

In the sentences in (17–20), the relativization site is occupied by a pronominal
element that resumes the relative clause head noun. This pronominal element is
the same one that resumes wh-words like miin/man ‘who’ and ʔayy(a) NP ‘which
NP’ in wh-interrogatives (see chapter 6). In the next sections we investigate the
properties of resumption in restrictive relatives in Arabic. We ﬁrst show that, in
those constructions, resumption presents a behavior different from that in wh-
interrogatives: in certain given contexts, resumption displays island sensitivity.
We then go on to discuss the properties of the relativized noun phrase, which is
related to the resumptive element.
7.6
Island sensitivity in restrictive relatives with weak
resumptive pronouns
The contrast between resumptive A′-constructions and gapped A′-
constructions with respect to island sensitivity is well known in the litera-
ture. We have already observed this contrast in wh-interrogatives. Whereas wh-
interrogatives involving gaps are sensitive to islands, wh-interrogatives involving
resumption are not. In this section we show that resumption is not a unitary phe-
nomenon with respect to island sensitivity and that some resumptive restrictive
relatives in Arabic are indeed sensitive to islands.
7.6.1
The absence of island sensitivity with weak resumptive pronouns
In general, weak resumptive elements can occur inside islands in restric-
tive relatives in Arabic, whether deﬁnite or indeﬁnite. This observation has been
made in the literature dealing with the subject (see, for example, Demirdache

It cannot be said, however, that resumptive restrictive relatives in Arabic are
not sensitive to islands. In what follows, we present evidence to show that

7.6 Island sensitivity in restrictive relatives with weak resumptive pronouns
175
deﬁnite relatives generated with a resumptive element are indeed sensitive to
islands.7
7.6.2
Abstract noun relativization and island sensitivity
The ﬁrst piece of evidence to show that resumptive restrictive relatives
are sensitive to islands comes from the relativization of abstract nouns like sərʕa
‘speed,’ ˇsaˇzeeʕa ‘courage,’ nazeeha ‘integrity,’ narvaze ‘nervousness,’ and Tiibit
ʔalb ‘kindness’: when they are used as manner adverbials in Lebanese Arabic,
these abstract nouns are introduced by an obligatory preposition, as illustrated in
(24):

7 This observation is a new one for the various Arabic dialects where it has been observed
that resumption always alleviates island violations (see, for example, Aoun and Choueiri
1996; Demirdache 1991).
8 The preposition bi ‘with’ which introduces the abstract NPs in (24) is realized as ﬁ(y)
with a weak pronominal element.

In (25), all the prepositional phrases inside the relative, which contain the resump-
tive element, modify a verb, expressing manner. The resumptive element can be
related to the relative clause external head across sentence boundaries. Again, the
absence of these resumptive elements yields unacceptable sentences, as indicated

7.6 Island sensitivity in restrictive relatives with weak resumptive pronouns
177
Interestingly, however, the resumptive elements corresponding to the manner
adverbs cannot be related to the relative clause external head across island bound-
aries. When the abstract noun is relativized from a position inside an adjunct
clause, a wh-clause, or a relative clause, the resulting sentences are unacceptable,
although a resumptive element appears in the relativized site (27–29).

The data concerning the relativization of abstract nouns like sərʕa ‘speed,’ˇsaˇzeeʕa
‘courage,’ nazeeha ‘integrity,’ narvaze ‘nervousness,’ and Tiibit ʔalb ‘kindness’
provide the ﬁrst indication that the presence of resumptive elements in (Lebanese)
Arabic deﬁnite relatives may not always coincide with the absence of island
sensitivity.
7.6.3
The relativization of idiomatic NP chunks
Another piece of evidence that shows that resumptive constructions in
Lebanese Arabic are selectively sensitive to islands comes from the relativization
of idiomatic NP chunks.9
The expression equivalent to take a nap in English is ʔaχad ʁaTTa in Lebanese
Arabic. That this expression is an idiomatic expression can be seen from the fact
that the noun ʁaTTa, which is a nominalization from the verb ʁaTT ‘to sleep,’ has
no independent meaning in Lebanese Arabic.
(30)
a. *l-ʁaTTa baʕd D-Duhr
bitﬁid
the-nap
after the-noon help.3fs
‘The nap in the afternoon helps.’
b. n-nawme baʕd D-Duhr
bitﬁid
the-sleep after the-noon help.3fs
‘The nap in the afternoon helps.’
(31)
*waSaf-l-e
l-¯hakiim
ʁaTTa baʕd D-Duhr
prescribe.3ms-to-me the-doctor nap
after the-noon
‘The doctor prescribed a nap in the afternoon.’
As shown by the unacceptability of (30a) and (31), the noun ʁaTTa cannot take
on the meaning ‘nap’ when it occurs by itself. In fact it has no meaning at all and
9 There is no systematic study of the behavior of idiomatic NP chunks in relativization
in Arabic. However, the discussion of the example in the text is sufﬁcient to make the
point about the absence of uniformity in the behavior of resumptive constructions with
respect to island constraints.

180
Restrictive relatives
the sentences are totally unacceptable. This interpretation of ʁaTTa as ‘nap’ is
contextualized and conditioned by the presence of the light verb ʔaχad ‘to take’
in (32):10
(32)
saami ʔaχad
ʁaTTa baʕd l-ʁada
Sami took.3ms nap
after the-lunch
‘Sami took a nap after lunch.’
Interestingly, the idiomatic NP chunk ʁaTTa cannot be pronominalized:
(33)
a. *saami ʔaχad
ʁaTTa baʕd l-ʁada
bas laila ma
Sami
took.3ms nap
after the-lunch but Laila Neg
ʔaχadit wə¯hde/-a
took.3fs one/-it
‘Sami took a nap after lunch but Laila didn’t take one/it.’
The unacceptability of (33) indicates that the idiomatic meaning ‘take a nap’
is not available when the NP ʁaTTa is replaced by a(n) (indeﬁnite) pronoun:
the contextualized occurrence of one instance of the idiomatic NP chunk ʁaTTa
with which the (indeﬁnite) pronoun can be anaphoric is not enough to salvage the
sentence. Brieﬂy put, ʁaTTa cannot enter into coreference relations with pronouns,
whether indeﬁnite like wə¯hde ‘one’ or not, like the pronominal clitic -a.
However, the NP ʁaTTa can be relativized, and in such a case, a resumptive
element is required in the relativization site:
(34)
a. l-ʁaTTa yalli ʔaχad-*(a)
saami baʕd l-ʁada
feedit-o
the-nap that took.3ms-her Sami after the-lunch helped.3fs-him
‘The nap that Sami took after lunch helped him.’
b. l-ʁaTTa yalli waSaf-l-e
l-¯hakiim
ʔənno
the-nap that prescribed.3ms-to-me the-doctor that
ʔeeχəd-*(a) baʕd l-ʁada
feedit-ne
take.1-it
after the-lunch helped.3fs-me
‘The nap that the doctor prescribed to me to take it after lunch
helped me.’
10 The idiomatic meaning ‘to take a nap’ appears also (and only) in the expression ʁaTT
ʁaTTa where the idiomatic NP chunk appears in the context of a cognate verb. The
generalizations concerning ʔaχad ʁaTTa in the text apply to the idiomatic expression
ʁaTT ʁaTTa.

7.6 Island sensitivity in restrictive relatives with weak resumptive pronouns
181
In both (34a) and (34b), the relativized idiomatic NP chunk is obligatorily related
to a weak resumptive pronominal, which appears attached to the verb. As we saw
in cases of relativization of abstract nouns functioning as manner adjuncts, the
relativization of the idiomatic NP chunk ʁaTTa is sensitive to islands, even in the
presence of resumptive elements in the relativization site:
(35)
a. Adjunct clause
*l-ʁaTTa yalli narvazit zeina laʔanno ʔaχad-a
saami
the-nap
that upset.3fs Zeina because took.3ms-her Sami
ʔabl
l-ʁada
feedit-o
before the-lunch helped.3fs-him
‘The nap that Zeina was upset because Sami took after lunch helped
him.’
b. Wh-clause
*l-ʁaTTa yalli badda
taʕrif
zeina ʔəza
ʔaχad-a
the-nap
that want.3fs know.3fs Zeina whether took.3ms-her
saami ʔabl
l-ʁada
feedit-o
Sami before the-lunch helped.3fs-him
‘The nap that Zeina wants to know whether Sami took before
lunch helped him.’
c. Relative clause
*l-ʁaTTa yalli btaʕrif
zeina S-Sabe lli
ʔaχad-a
ʔabl
the-nap
that know.3fs Zeina the-boy that took.3ms-her before
l-ʁada
feedit-o
the-lunch helped.3fs-him
‘The nap that Zeina knows the boy that took before lunch helped
him.’
Thus, when the idiomatic NP chunk ʁaTTa is related to a resumptive element
within an adjunct clause, a wh-clause, or a relative clause, the result is unaccept-
able. The relativization of idiom chunk NPs provides us then with an additional
context where the presence of a weak resumptive element does not coincide with
the absence of island sensitivity.
The facts from (Lebanese) Arabic discussed in this section indicate that, for
cases of relativization of certain adjuncts and idiomatic NP chunks, resump-
tion obeys island conditions, such as the wh-clause constraint, the complex NP
constraint, and the adjunct clause constraint. Therefore, one can conclude that
resumption in restrictive relatives appears to be selectively sensitive to islands.
This depends on the nature of the relativized head.

182
Restrictive relatives
A remark is in order here about the parallelism between adjuncts and idiomatic
NP chunks, which has been discussed in the literature by Rizzi (1990).11 In addition
to the parallelism detected in the context of relativization, extraction of idiomatic
NP chunks from wh-islands is on a par with the extraction of adjuncts; it is strongly
disallowed:
(36)
a. ??Who do you wonder whether we believe we can help t?
b. *How do you wonder whether we believe we can help Bill t?
(37)
Lebanese Arabic
a. ?? ʔayya miˇskle
baddak
taʕrif
[kiif [ra¯h n¯hill t t ] ] ?
which
problem want.2ms know.2ms [how [fut.solve.1p t t ] ]
‘Which problem do you want to know how we will solve?’
b. *kiif baddak
taʕrif
[ʔayya miˇskle
[ra¯h n¯hill t t ] ]?
how want.2ms know.2ms [which problem [fut.solve.1p t t ] ]
‘How do you want to know which problem we will solve?’
What manner adjuncts and idiomatic NP chunks have in common is that they are
non-referential noun phrases. We have already observed that idiomatic NP chunks
cannot be coreferent with pronouns in discourse (the relevant example is repeated
in (38)):
(38)
*saami
ʔaχad
ʁaTTa baʕd l-ʁada
bas laila ma
Sami
took.3ms nap
after the-lunch but Laila Neg
ʔaχadit wə¯hde/-a
took.3fs one/-it
‘Sami took a nap after lunch but Laila didn’t take one/it.’
11 Additional evidence that idiomatic NP chunks in Lebanese Arabic differ from selected
arguments comes from the fact that a typical object of the verbs ʔaχad ‘take,’ ʔakal
‘ate,’ or taʕma ‘fed’ can be questioned using the wh-words ˇsu ‘what’ or ʔayya NP
‘which NP,’ as illustrated in (ia):
(i)
a. ˇsu/
ʔayya bluze ʔaχadte
what/ which shirt
took.2fs
‘What/Which shirt did you take?’
b. kam
ʁaTTa ʔaχadte l-yom
how.many nap
take.2fs the-day
‘How many naps did you take today?’
When the verb ʔaχad ‘take,’ which enters into the idiomatic expression ʔaχad ʁaTTa
‘take a nap,’ occurs with the wh-word ˇsu ‘what,’ the idiomatic meaning is not available
any more. The only possible way to question the idiomatic NP chunk in that expression
is by using kam ‘how much/many,’ as illustrated in (ib).

7.6 Island sensitivity in restrictive relatives with weak resumptive pronouns
183
The same generalization holds for the manner adjuncts discussed in section 7.6.2.
Thus, whereas the ﬁrst part of the sentence in (39) is totally acceptable in isolation,
the whole discourse, with the relevant interpretation of the pronoun in the second
sentence, is unacceptable:
nazeeha
‘integrity’
sərʕa
‘speed’

‘Sami works with integrity/speed/nervousness/courage/kindness.
And all the workers work with it too.’
The generalization here is that only referential NPs, which can corefer with
pronouns in discourse, can be resumed by a weak pronoun in island contexts.
As we have discussed in chapter 6, in Cinque (1990), referentiality is equated
with the ability to refer to a speciﬁc member of a pre-established set, and therefore,
recalls Pesetsky’s (1987) notion of d-linking. Cinque (1990) further points out
that referential NPs can enter into coreference relations and can undergo long
wh-movement. In this section, we have observed that only referential relativized
NPs can be resumed by a weak pronominal element occurring inside different
island contexts. That is, in the context of restrictive relatives, island contexts seem
to impose the referential reading on the antecedent of a resumptive element, while
non-island contexts don’t.
Kroch (1989), in a discussion of amount quantiﬁcation in the context of wh-
interrogatives, arrives at a similar conclusion. A question like (40a) is associ-
ated with two different presuppositions, one corresponding to the non-referential
reading of the wh-interrogative (40b), and the other to the referential reading
(40c).
(40)
a. How many books did the editor publish this year?
b. There is an amount of books such that the editor published that
amount this year.
c. There is a set of books such that the editor published that set this year.
However, in the context of long wh-movement, the only presupposition associ-
ated with the wh-interrogative is the one that corresponds to the referential reading,
as illustrated in (41).

184
Restrictive relatives
(41)
a. How many books did Bill ask whether the company was interested in
publishing?
b. There was a set of books for which Bill asked whether the company
was interested in publishing them.
Kroch claims that the reason why the presupposition that corresponds to the non-
referential reading is absent in the context of long wh-movement is pragmatic:
that is, while it is well-formed, it is odd and renders the question unusable in most
contexts. Thus a wh-interrogative which can plausibly have only a non-referential
reading is unacceptable.
(42)
a. *How much money was John wondering whether to pay?
b. There was a sum of money about which John was wondering
whether to pay it.
The presupposition in (42b) is odd because it states that there is a uniquely
identiﬁed sum of money and that John was wondering whether to pay that sum.
As we have seen in chapter 6, in Lebanese Arabic wh-interrogatives, the
resumptive element cannot have a non-referential antecedent wh-word. In restric-
tive relatives, however, this requirement seems to be relaxed a little: a resump-
tive pronominal can have a non-referential antecedent as long as the resumptive
pronominal does not occur within an island. In restrictive relatives, several types
of islands seem to impose the referential reading on the antecedent of a resump-
tive pronominal. The analysis argued for by Kroch (1989) cannot be extended
to account for all those cases and it is therefore still unclear why islands force
a referential reading on the antecedent of a resumptive pronominal (see section
7.7.2 for further elaboration).
7.7
Indeﬁnite relatives, idiom chunks, and abstract
noun relativization
We have already observed the distinction between indeﬁnite and deﬁnite
relatives in Arabic. It has already been noted that indeﬁnite relatives do not make
use of a relativizer and, in dialects that make use of the gap strategy in relativization,
indeﬁnite relatives make exclusive use of the resumptive strategy. Now we turn to
another distinction between the two types of relatives having to do with the nature
of the relativized noun phrase.

7.7 Indeﬁnite relatives, idiom chunks, and abstract noun relativization
185
7.7.1
Resumption in indeﬁnite relatives and the nature
of the antecedent
Interestingly, the relativization of abstract nouns used as manner adjuncts
and idiom chunks cannot result in an indeﬁnite relative. Thus, the sentences in
(43) contrast with the sentences in (44), and (45) contrasts with the sentence in
(46).

As seen in (44a–b), when the relativized head is an abstract noun interpreted as a
manner adverbial, it cannot be related to a resumptive element inside the sentence.
Similarly, an idiomatic chunk appearing as the head of an indeﬁnite relative yields
unacceptable sentences.

Thus, indeﬁnite relatives, which we have already observed use only the resump-
tive strategy, also force the relativized head to be referential. Hence the relativized
head of an indeﬁnite relative can be neither an abstract adjunct noun phrase nor
an idiomatic chunk, since those can only have a non-referential reading.
7.7.2
Restrictive relatives and movement
A question can be put forth at this point as to what indeﬁnite relatives
and island contexts have in common that they impose a referential reading on the
antecedent of a resumptive pronominal. An answer that is discussed in Choueiri
(2002) relates this observation to movement in the context of resumption within
restrictive relatives.12 Choueiri (2002) argues that the derivation of deﬁnite rela-
tives differs greatly from that of indeﬁnite relatives and that only the former involve
movement. Building on work by Aoun and Choueiri (1996), Choueiri’s (2002)
proposal is that deﬁnite relatives have two possible representations available to
them, given in (47a) and (47b), whereas only one representation, given in (48) is
available to indeﬁnite relatives. Deﬁnite relatives, as indicated in (47) can either
be generated by movement (47a) or they can be base-generated (47b); Indeﬁnite
relatives can only be base-generated (48).

The referential reading is associated with the representation that involves
a pronoun (pro) in the variable site. Since indeﬁnite relatives have only that

187
representation, it is no surprise that they allow only the referential reading. The
representation in (47b) is the only one available in island contexts and therefore
those contexts will allow only the referential reading in deﬁnite relatives as well.
The representation in (47a) is derived by movement, and there the relativized noun
phrase is associated with a trace. This is the only representation available for the
relativization of adjuncts and idiomatic chunks as well as the subject of existential
constructions. Given the relations between movement and island sensitivity, it
comes as no surprise that the latter category of relatives is sensitive to islands.
In chapter 9, we investigate further the relationship between resumption
and movement in Arabic. However a few more words need to be said about
the discussion in the literature dealing with Semitic languages on the relation
between resumption and movement in relativization. There, it is mainly argued
that resumption stands in opposition to movement and that resumption involves
base-generation. This is the position held in Shlonsky (1992), where it is fur-
ther argued that resumption is a last resort strategy that languages make use
of when (wh-)movement fails. Demirdache (1991) argues for a different posi-
tion, where resumptive restrictive relatives do involve movement, albeit covert
movement.
Based on the observation that resumption in Semitic is not sensitive to islands,
Demirdache (1991) argues that resumptive relatives in Arabic represent a case of
“relativization in situ,” parallel to what is observed in wh-in-situ constructions.
That is, the resumptive element in restrictive relatives is an operator that occurs in
the variable position in syntax, but is later moved for interpretation, in LF. If island
sensitivity constrains only overt movement, then the absence of island sensitivity
in restrictive relatives is also accounted for. In a comparative study of Hebrew and
Palestinian Arabic restrictive relatives, Shlonsky (1992) follows another approach
to resumption, assuming that resumptive constructions are base-generated and do
not involve movement at all. The assumption is supported by the distribution of
resumption in Hebrew restrictive relatives, where it can generally be said that
resumptive pronouns are available, when movement (gaps) is disallowed.13 In
Palestinian Arabic, however, as in all Arabic dialects, the resumptive strategy is
the default strategy even when relativizing from positions like the direct object
positions, which readily allow movement in wh-questions, for instance. In order
to account for the Palestinian Arabic data under the assumption that resumption is
a last resort strategy available when movement is not, Shlonsky (1992) suggests
that illi, the Palestinian Arabic relativizer, marks its speciﬁer as an A-position.
13 However, in Hebrew, gaps alternate with resumptive pronouns in direct object and
embedded subject positions. Shlonsky (1992) provides an analysis for those facts as
well.

188
Restrictive relatives
Thus, movement to the speciﬁer position of illi is a type of A-movement and is
therefore very local. Only the subject closest to illi (the highest subject) can move
to its speciﬁer, otherwise, movement from any other position will be blocked by
the highest subject; a case of minimality. This analysis can easily carry over to
other dialects of Arabic that use an equivalent relativizer to illi, and it correctly
predicts that the only gap that is allowed in Palestinian Arabic is in the highest
subject position.
We will observe in chapter 9 that the relationship between resumption and
movement is more complex than is argued in Shlonsky (1992) and Demirdache
(1991). However, it is already clear that both analyses cannot account for the
observed facts in Lebanese Arabic, where it can be argued that resumptive restric-
tive relatives involve overt movement in the contexts of idiomatic chunks and
adjunct relativization, which show island sensitivity.
7.8
Conclusion
In this chapter we have examined in detail the distribution of weak
resumptive pronominal elements in restrictive relatives in various Arabic dialects.
We ﬁrst noted that resumption is the default strategy for forming restrictive relatives
in the various dialects of Arabic, although the gap strategy is still available to some
and in some contexts.
Based on the facts observed, we came to three major conclusions. First, restric-
tive relatives in Arabic need to be separated into two categories: deﬁnite relatives
and indeﬁnite relatives. Deﬁnite relatives are introduced by a relativizer, whereas
indeﬁnite relatives are not. The relativized noun phrase in deﬁnite relatives is deﬁ-
nite, while it is indeﬁnite in indeﬁnite relatives. More importantly, it is only deﬁnite
relatives that allow the gap strategy; indeﬁnite relatives always involve resumption.
Deﬁnite relatives allow the relativized noun phrase to be non-referential, while
this is not the case for indeﬁnite relatives.
Second, the gap strategy in restrictive relatives, as in wh-interrogatives, shows
island sensitivity. However, we have observed that the resumptive strategy in
restrictive relatives is also sensitive to islands when the antecedent of the resump-
tive element is a non-referential noun phrase. If island sensitivity is related to
movement, this observation indicates that resumptive restrictive relatives can also
be generated by movement.
Third, the relationship between resumption and referentiality is not as straight-
forward as has been noted in the literature. That is, it is not the case that resumptive
pronominal elements can have only referential antecedents. We have seen that this

7.8 Conclusion
189
constraint is imposed on the antecedent of a resumptive element in restrictive
relatives only when this element occurs inside an island.
An issue that we have not tackled in this chapter is that of the structure of
restrictive relatives in Arabic. This issue is a problematic one and is still under
debate in the literature dealing with the topic of relativization (see among others
Kayne 1994; Bianchi 1999; Borsely 1997; and Ouhalla 2004 for Semitic).14
14 Ouhalla (2004) proposes, based on data from Semitic, a new typology for restrictive
relatives: DP vs. CP relatives. CP relatives use the sentential complementizer to introduce
relatives, as we can observe in Hebrew, for instance:
(i)
a. ha-yeled ˇse
rina ohevet oto
the-boy
that Rina loves
him
‘The boy that Rina loves.’
b. amarti le-david ˇse
oto rina ohevet
said.I
to-David that him Rina loves
‘I said to David that Rina loves him.’
It can easily be observed that the same element that introduces the restrictive relative
in the sentence in (ia) functions also as a complementizer in (ib). This is not the case in
the various dialects of Arabic, as observed at the outset of this chapter. In Arabic, the
relativizer is akin to a deﬁnite determiner (see Fassi Fehri 1982; Aoun and Choueiri 1996;
Choueiri 2002). Apart from the morphological similarity between the deﬁnite determiner
(a)l- in Arabic and the relativizer lli/illi/yalli/ (a)l-laði, its presence in deﬁnite relatives
and its absence in indeﬁnite relatives recalls the presence of the deﬁnite determiner in
deﬁnite noun phrases and its absence in indeﬁnite noun phrases, as illustrated in (ii).
(ii)
a. l-kteeb
l-binne
the-book the-brown
‘The brown book.’
b. kteeb binne
book brown
‘A brown book.’
This difference in the categorical identity of the relative clauses together with the
assumption that in Semitic noun phrases N moves to D drive the representation that
Ouhalla gives for Semitic relatives, where the relative clause is generated as a left
speciﬁer of N and the relativized noun phrase is a head generated in N later moving to
D. It is not clear whether this analysis is the one to be adopted for all deﬁnite relatives,
even those that involve a non-referential relativized noun phrase. In such cases, it is
not clear how the island sensitivity can be captured, since Ouhalla’s analysis does not
involve movement of the relativized NP. We leave this issue open for future discussions.

Clitic-left dislocation and focus

8.1
Introduction
It has become clear by now that the relationship between referentiality
and resumption is more complex than has been observed in the literature. It is
not the case, for instance, that the antecedent of a resumptive element must be
referential. This was an important conclusion arrived at in the investigation of
restrictive relatives in Arabic (see chapter 7). In this chapter, which examines
two different A′-constructions – clitic-left dislocation and focus fronting – we
will see a conﬁrmation for that conclusion in the context of clitic-left dislocation.
By comparing and contrasting the properties of clitic-left dislocation and focus
fronting, we also begin the investigation of the syntax of the left periphery in
Arabic.
The chapter starts with an investigation of clitic-left dislocation. We focus
on the distribution of clitic-left dislocated elements with respect to other ele-
ments of the left periphery, notably wh-elements. We then investigate the rela-
tionship between clitic-left dislocated elements and the resumptive pronomi-
nal they are related to within the sentence. The second part of the chapter
deals with focus fronting. Here we also examine the distribution of the focus
fronted elements with respect to other elements in the left periphery, notably
wh-elements and clitic-left dislocated elements. We then turn to the relationship
between focus fronted elements and the gap to which they are related inside
the sentence. Finally, we examine various analyses of focus fronting that try to
account for the differences between those constructions and clitic-left disloca-
tion, as well as for the parallelisms observed between focus fronting and gapped
wh-interrogatives.

Clitic-left dislocation in Arabic
8.2.1
The distribution of clitic-left dislocated NPs
Clitic-left dislocation (henceforth CLLD) is characterized by the presence
of a lexical noun phrase in the left peripheral domain of a clause and a weak
pronominal element related to it, inside the clause. Typical examples of this
construction in Arabic are given in (1).
(1)
a. naadia ˇseef-a
saami mbeeri¯h
Lebanese Arabic
Nadia saw.3ms-her Sami yesterday
‘Nadia, Sami saw her yesterday.’
b. at-tilmiiðat-u
raʔaa-ha
saami l-baari¯ha
Standard
the-student.fs-Nom saw.3ms-her Sami the-yesterday
Arabic
‘The student, Sami saw her yesterday.’
In Standard Arabic, the dislocated noun phrase typically appears with Nomi-
native Case marking, as shown in (1b). In Lebanese Arabic, the CLLDed noun
phrase in matrix contexts can be found either before elements of the complemen-
tizer phrase (2a) or after them (2b).
(2)
a. naadia ˇsu
ʔaalət-la
l-mʕallme?
Nadia what told.3fs-her.Dat the-teacher.fs
‘Nadia, what did the teacher tell her?’
b. ˇsu
naadia ʔaalət-la
l-mʕallme?
what Nadia told.3fs-her.Dat the-teacher.fs
‘What Nadia did the teacher tell her?’
In Standard Arabic, the only possible position for the dislocated phrase is preceding
the elements of the complementizer phrase (3–4).
(3)
a. naadia mataa raʔaa-ha
saami?
Nadia when saw.3ms-her Sami
‘Nadia, when did Sami see her?’
b. *mata naadia raʔaa-ha
saami?
when Nadia saw.3ms-her Sami
‘Nadia, when did Sami see her?’
(4)
a. zayd-un
hal qaabalta-hu?
Zayd-Nom Q
met.2ms-him
‘Zayd, did you meet him?’

192
Clitic-left dislocation and focus constructions
b. *hal zayd-un
qaabalta-hu?
Q
Zayd-Nom met.2ms-him
‘Zayd, did you meet him?’
In embedded contexts, however, the dislocated noun phrase in Lebanese Arabic
can only occur after the complementizer, as the contrast between (5a) and (5b)
shows.
(5)
a. fakkart
ʔənno naadia ˇseef-a
kariim mbeeri¯h
thought.1s that
Nadia saw.3ms-her Karim yesterday
‘I thought that Nadia, Karim saw her yesterday.’
b. *fakkart
naadia ʔənno ˇseef-a
kariim mbeeri¯h
thought.1s Nadia that
saw.3ms-her Karim yesterday
In embedded contexts in Standard Arabic, the dislocated NP can also appear
after the complementizer. In such cases, however, the dislocated NP is assigned
Accusative Case by the complementizer, as can be seen in (6).1

zaʕamtu
ʔanna r-risaalat-a

kataba-ha

the-letter-Acc the-boy-Nom wrote.3ms-it
‘I claimed that the letter, the boy wrote it.’
8.2.2
Clitic-left dislocation and left dislocation
Cinque (1977, 1990) distinguishes between clitic-left dislocation and left
dislocation (LD), a construction also called hanging topic. LD, as Cinque deﬁnes
it, is a root clause phenomenon and only one LDed phrase is allowed per sentence.
As observed in section 8.2.1, CLLD can occur in many embedded contexts. In
addition to (5a) and (6), the facts from Lebanese Arabic in (7) illustrate this
observation.
1 As seen in chapter 2, the ﬁnite clause complementizer in Standard Arabic assigns
Accusative Case to the NP that obligatorily follows it. Further evidence that the com-
plementizer ʔanna assigns Accusative Case to the adjacent NP comes from the fact that
if the dislocated NP does not immediately follow the complementizer, it appears with
Nominative Case marking, as illustrated in (i):
(i)
zaʕamtu
ʔanna al-walad-a
r-risaalat-u

‘The only person that Zeina, we introduced her to him turned out not

Furthermore, there can be more than one clitic-left dislocated NP in a given
clause (8a) or sentence (8b):
(8)
a. kariim zeina ʕarrafnee-ha
ʕal-ee
Karim Zeina introduced.1p-her to-him
‘Karim, Zeina, we introduced her to him.’
b. kariim ma

‘Karim, we told him that Zeina, Sami saw her yesterday.’
This situation is impossible in LD contexts, as illustrated by topicalization in
English (9).
(9)
*Mary, John, she likes him.
Cinque adds that CLLD is characterized by the fact that any phrase can be
CLLDed. In Arabic, however, only noun phrases can be clitic-left dislocated, as
there are no clitics that correspond to another type of phrase.2
2 Cinque also mentions that in CLLD in Italian there is obligatory connectivity between
the dislocated phrase and the IP internal position, with respect to Binding Theory, for
instance, as illustrated in (ia) for Principles A and B:

194
Clitic-left dislocation and focus constructions
8.2.3
The nature of the CLLDed element
In addition to the restriction of CLLDed elements to noun phrases in
Arabic, there are additional constraints imposed on the nature of those elements.
Thus, CLLDed noun phrases cannot be indeﬁnite, as the contrast between (10)
and (11) shows:
(10)
a. *qaSiidat-un ʔallafa-ha
ʕomar
Standard Arabic
poem-Nom
wrote.3ms-it Omar
‘A poem, Omar wrote it.’
b. *ʔaSiide ʔallaf-a
ʕomar
Lebanese Arabic

‘A poem, Omar wrote it.’
(11)
a. al-qaSiidat-u

‘The poem, Omar wrote it.’
b. l-ʔaSiide ʔallaf-a
ʕomar
Lebanese Arabic
the-poem wrote.3ms-it Omar
‘The poem, Omar wrote it.’
Therefore, it comes as no surprise that names (as illustrated in (8) and elsewhere)
and demonstrative noun phrases (12), as well as strong pronouns (13), which are
also deﬁnite, may be clitic-left dislocated.
(12)

In (ib), coreference between Nadia and the subject of the main clause is possible. The
possibility of having the coreference reading indicates that (ib) does not violate Principle
C, which prohibits names to be bound. This indicates that in Lebanese Arabic connectivity
for Binding Theory in CLLD constructions is not obligatory. For further discussion on
this issue see chapter 9.

In addition to deﬁnite noun phrases, some quantiﬁed phrases can be CLLDed:
universally quantiﬁed phrases like kəll NP ‘every/each NP,’ as well as ʕiddit NP
‘many/several NP’ and ʔaØlabiyyit NP ‘most NP’ from Lebanese Arabic, can all
occur as clitic-left dislocated elements.

In light of those facts, one is hard pressed to answer the question as to what
brings together deﬁnite NPs with such quantiﬁers as kəll ‘every/each,’ ʕəddit
‘several/many,’ and ʔaØlabiyyit ‘most,’ While it is clear that the deﬁnite arti-
cle, the universal quantiﬁer, and ʔaØlabiyyit ‘most’ are strong determiners
(Milsark 1977) in that they cannot occur in the subject position of there-existential
constructions (17), ʕəddit NP ‘several/many NP,’ like indeﬁnite noun phrases, can

8.2 Clitic-left dislocation in Arabic
197
Thus, it is not the strength of the determiner that determines whether a noun phrase
can be CLLDed or not.
To complicate the picture further, it can be observed that NPIs like wala NP ‘no
NP’ in Lebanese Arabic can also be CLLDed (19).3
(19)
wala siyyara ʔaalo
ʔənno ˇzeebuw-a
min almaania
Lebanese

Arabic
‘No car, they said that they brought it from Germany.’
In contrast with wala NP ‘no NP,’ bare negative noun phrases like ma ¯hada or
maˇsi cannot be clitic-left dislocated:
(20)
a. *ma ¯hada ˇseeﬁt-o
zeina ʕam bizaʕbir
no

‘No one, Zeina saw him cheating.’
b. *maˇsi
ˇzeebit-o
lina min d-dikkeen
nothing brought.3ms-it Lina from the-store
‘Nothing, Lina brought it from the store.’
We have already observed (see chapters 6 and 7) that the relationship between
referentiality and resumption is a complex one. In wh-interrogatives, all wh-
words that can occur directly related to a resumptive pronominal are referential
(although the reverse is not true). In restrictive relatives however, referentiality
only constrains the relativized noun phrase that is related to a resumptive element
within an island. In the context of CLLD as well, we see that referentiality does
not adequately delimit the set of noun phrases that can be CLLDed. Recall that
referentiality, understood as in Cinque (1990), is relevant for binding relations
in the following way: only referential noun phrases can enter into coreference
relations. We can clearly observe that some NP types, which can be CLLDed,
cannot enter into coreference relations with a pronoun. On one hand, the universal
quantiﬁer kəll ‘every/each,’ when used with a singular NP cannot enter into
coreference relations (21a) and neither does the negative noun phrases wala NP
‘no NP’ (21b).4
3 The Lebanese Arabic wala NP ‘no NP’ is clearly negative and can only be used in negative
contexts. The equivalent in Standard Arabic, the NPI ʔayyu NP, is not inherently negative,
since it can also function as a wh-phrase (see chapter 6) and it cannot be CLLDed. For
the purposes of the present discussion, we will abstract away from the issue of whether
wala NP ‘no NP’ is to be classiﬁed as a negative quantiﬁer phrase rather than an NPI.
4 ma ¯hada ‘no one’ and maˇsi ‘nothing,’ which cannot be CLLDed, do not enter into
coreference relations with pronouns, as can be seen in (i):

5 Recall, from chapter 6, that kam NP ‘(how) many NP,’ which can also function as a wh-
phrase, cannot be related to a resumptive element in a wh-interrogative. We have shown
there as well that kam NP ‘(how) many NP’ has a referential reading as a wh-phrase.

8.2 Clitic-left dislocation in Arabic
199
It is interesting to note as well that the set of NPs that can be CLLDed is more
restricted than the set of NPs that can occur as preverbal subjects. Thus, while
indeﬁnite NPs and kam NP ‘few NP’ cannot occur as preverbal subjects, ma ¯hada
and maˇsi can (23):6
(24)
a. *kam walad rikib/rikbo
b-l-baS

‘Few children rode the bus.’

c. ma ¯hada ʔiˇza

d. maˇsi

The table in (25) summarizes the facts discussed so far in section 8.2.3:

The major conclusions that we can draw from those facts are: (a) a conﬁrmation

Clitic-left dislocation and focus constructions
notion of referentiality (or d-linking) is not a deﬁning characteristic of CLLDed
NPs. We have suggested in chapter 6 that the wh-words which can be directly
related to a resumptive pronominal element are those that form a DP. Applying
this proposal in the context of CLLD, it would entail that ma ¯hada ‘no one’ and
maˇsi ‘nothing,’ as well as bare indeﬁnite noun phrases, are not DPs. More work
needs to be done in this area to arrive at a proper deﬁnition of the nature of elements
that can be related to resumptive pronominals.
8.2.4
The distribution of pronominal clitics inside CLLD
constructions
The pronominal clitic related to the CLLDed element can be a direct
object clitic, a dative clitic, or a genitive clitic. Direct object clitics are attached to
the verb, as illustrated in (26) and (27a); dative clitics are also attached to the verb
(27b).
(26)

b. fakkart
ʔənno ʕomar ¯həkyət-lo

thought.1s that
Omar told.3fs-him Zeina story
‘I thought that Omar, Zeina told him a story.’
The clitic can also be a genitive clitic attached to a preposition or an adnominal
clitic attached to the head noun. This is illustrated in the Lebanese Arabic examples
in (28a) and (28b) respectively.
(28)
a. sməʕt

b. sməʕte

kteeb-o

‘You heard that Omar, we read his book.’
The relation between the left peripheral NP and the pronominal clitic can violate
island conditions in Arabic. We exemplify this observation in Lebanese Arabic
using the adjunct clause condition (29), the complex NP island condition (30), and
the wh-island condition (31).

As those examples clearly illustrate, CLLD constructions in Arabic consis-
tently violate island conditions. These data are consistent with what we have seen
in chapter 6 with resumptive wh-interrogatives. Here as well, this generalization
can lead to the conclusion that CLLD constructions in Arabic are generated with-
out any movement. That is, it can be argued that the peripheral noun phrase in
those constructions is base-generated in its surface position and coindexed with a
pronominal clitic occupying an argument position inside the sentence (see, among
others, Ouhalla 1994b).
8.3
Focus constructions in Arabic
CLLD in Arabic can be distinguished from another construction involving
a left peripheral phrase, but a gap instead of a pronominal element within the
sentence; that is the focus fronting construction.
Focus constructions have not been discussed by many students of Arabic syntax,
generally because their study sits at the edge of syntax and pragmatics, and tradi-
tionally focus has been dealt with in the context of rhetoric rather than grammar.7
Here, we will examine the syntax of focus constructions in Arabic, contrasting
them especially with CLLD.
7 Among the major analyses of focus constructions in Arabic, we can count Bakir (1980),
Moutaouakil (1989), Ouhalla (1994b), and Shlonsky (2000). Our discussion in this section
relies mainly on Ouhalla (1994b) and Shlonsky (2000).

202
Clitic-left dislocation and focus constructions
Focus constructions in Arabic need not involve fronting. Thus, a phrase can be
focused in situ (32), or displaced to a left peripheral position in the sentence (33).
(32)
a. ˇsariba
zayd-un
ˇsay-an
Standard Arabic
drank.3ms Zayd-Nom tea-Acc
‘Zayd drank TEA.’
b. ˇsərib
zayd ˇsay
Lebanese Arabic
drank.3ms Zayd tea
‘Zayd drank TEA.’
(33)
a. ˇsay-an ˇsariba
zayd-un
Standard Arabic
tea-Acc drank.3ms Zayd-Nom
‘It was tea that Zayd drank.’
b. ˇsay ˇsərib
zayd
Lebanese Arabic
tea drank.3ms Zayd
‘It was tea that Zayd drank.’
It is argued that the two types of focus constructions are not equivalent in discourse
(Moutaouakil 1989): whereas in-situ focus phrases can function as new informa-
tion focus, fronted focus phrases can only be understood contrastively, that is, in
contrast with pre-existing information, which they deny (Ouhalla 1994b). Thus,
only the sentences in (32) represent felicitous answers to the questions in (34).
(34)
a. maaðaa ˇsariba
zayd-un?
Standard Arabic
what
drank.3ms Zayd-Nom
‘What did Zayd drink?’
b. ˇsu
ˇsərib
zayd?
Lebanese Arabic
what drank.3ms Zayd
‘What did Zayd drink?’
As Ouhalla (1994b) further points out, the contrastive focus reading can be
shown by the use of a negative continuation for the sentences in (33), as illustrated
in (35).
(35)
a. ˇsay-an ˇsariba
zayd-un
laa ʕaSiir-an
Standard Arabic

‘It was tea that Zayd drank, not juice.’
b. ˇsay ˇsərib

Lebanese Arabic
tea drank.3ms Zayd not milk
‘It was tea that Zayd drank, not milk.’

8.3 Focus constructions in Arabic
203
In the remainder of this chapter, our discussion will address the properties of
fronted focus phrases. How they differ from CLLDed phrases and how they
interact with them provide clues as to the mapping of the left periphery in
Arabic.
8.3.1
The distribution of fronted focused phrases
As observed earlier, focus fronting is characterized by the presence of a
phrase in the left peripheral domain of a clause, which is related to a gap inside
the clause. Typical examples of this construction in Arabic are given in (36).
(36)
a. naadia ˇseef
saami
Lebanese Arabic
Nadia saw.3ms Sami
‘Nadia, Sami saw.’
b. al-kitaab-a
waˇzada
mu¯hammad-un
Standard Arabic
the-book-Acc found.3ms Muhammad-Nom
‘The book, Muhammad found.’
When the sentence initial focused phrase is a direct object, it appears with
Accusative Case marking in Standard Arabic, as seen in (36b) above. That is,
the case marking on the fronted focus phrase matches that of the corresponding
gap.
In embedded contexts, focus phrases, like CLLDed noun phrases, must follow
the complementizer (37–38).8
(37)
a. ʔaðunnu ʔanna ﬁbaØdaad-a
¯haSala
l-ʔittifaaq-u
think.1s that
in Baghdad-Acc happened.3ms the-agreement-Nom
‘I think that in Baghdad, the agreement took place.’
8 Shlonsky (2000) notes the unacceptability of the sentence in (ib), which contrasts with
(ia):
(i)
a. zaʕamtu
ʔanna r-risaalat-a
kataba-ha
l-walad-u
claimed.1s that
the-letter-Acc wrote.3ms-it the-boy-Nom
‘I claimed that the letter, the boy wrote it.’
b. *zaʕamtu
ʔanna r-risaalat-a
kataba
l-walad-u
claimed.1s that
the-letter-Acc wrote.3ms the-boy-Nom
‘I claimed that the letter, the boy wrote.’
Obviously, this observation is contradicted by the data provided in the text.

204
Clitic-left dislocation and focus constructions
b. ðanantu
ʔanna kitaab-an qaraʔat zaynab-u
(Ouhalla
believe.1s that
book-Acc read.3fs Zaynab-Nom
1994b: 70)
‘I believe that, a book, Zaynab read.’
(38)
a. biftikir
ʔənno bi-ˇs-ˇseem
ra¯h tleeʔe
ʔimm-ak
ˇsaraaˇsif
think.1s that
in-the-Damascus fut. ﬁnd.3fs mother-you sheets
‘I think that in Damascus, your mother will ﬁnd sheets.’
b. biftikir
ʔənno kariim ʕarraﬁt
zeina ʕa-l-mʕallme
think.1s that
Karim introduced.3fs Zeina to-the-teacher.fs
‘I think that Karim, Zeina introduced to the teacher.’
It is impossible to check whether, in matrix contexts, the focus phrase precedes
or follows elements in the complementizer phrase, since focused elements are
incompatible with questions, as illustrated in (39) for Standard Arabic and (40)
for Lebanese Arabic.
(39)
a. *ʔayna saalim-an qaabala xaalid-un
where
Salim-Acc met.3ms xaalid-Nom
b. *saalim-an ʔayna qaabala xaalid-un
Salim-Acc where met.3ms xaalid-Nom
(40)
a. *ween saalim ˇseeﬁt
zeina
where Salim saw.3fs Zeina
b. *saalim ween ˇseeﬁt
zeina
Salim
where saw.3fs Zeina
However, in Standard Arabic, focused phrases must follow CLLDed NPs in matrix
contexts (41), as observed in Bakir (1980).
(41)
a. faaTimat-u
l-wardat-a
ʔaʕTaa-ha
saalim-un
Fatima-Nom the-rose-Acc gave.3ms-her Salim-Nom
‘Fatima, the rose Salim gave her.’
b. *l-wardat-a
faaTimat-u
ʔaʕTaa-ha
saalim-un
the-rose-Acc Fatima-Nom gave.3ms-her Salim-Nom
‘Fatima, the rose Salim gave her.’
In Lebanese Arabic, focus phrases can either precede or follow CLLDed noun
phrases (42).
(42)
a. ʕa kariim zeina ʕarrafnee-ha
to Karim Zeina introduced.1p-her
‘It is to Karim that we introduced Zeina.’

8.3 Focus constructions in Arabic
205
b. zeina ʕa kariim ʕarrafnee-ha
Zeina to Karim introduced.1p-her
‘It is to Karim that we introduced Zeina.’
The facts in (41)–(42) obtain whether the focus phrase is found in matrix or
embedded contexts. The requirement that focus phrases follow CLLDed NPs in
Standard Arabic could be tied to another fact that obtains in the language: focus
fronting in Standard Arabic triggers obligatory subject–verb inversion (Ouhalla
1994b) (43). The fact that this generalization does not hold in Lebanese Arabic
comes as no surprise (44).
(43)
a. *kitaab-an zaynab-u
ʔiˇstarat
book-Acc
Zaynab-Nom bought.3fs
b. kitaab-an ʔiˇstarat
zaynab-u
book-Acc
bought.3fs Zaynab-Nom
‘It is a book that Zaynab bought.’
(44)
a. kteeb zaynab ˇstarit
book
Zaynab bought.3fs
‘It is a book that Zaynab bought.’
b. kteeb ˇstarit
zaynab
book
bought.3fs Zaynab
‘It is a book that Zaynab bought.’
We can thus draw a parallel between focus fronting and wh-interrogatives, since
wh-questions in Standard Arabic require subject–verb inversion (45), but they do
not do so in Lebanese Arabic (46).
(45)
a. *maaðaa zaynab-u
ʔiˇstarat
what
Zaynab-Nom bought.3fs
b. maaðaa ʔiˇstarat
zaynab-u
what
bought.3fs Zaynab-Nom
‘What did Zaynab buy?’
(46)
a. ʔayya kteeb zaynab ˇstarit
which book Zaynab bought.3fs
‘Which book did Zaynab buy?’
b. ʔayya kteeb ˇstarit
zaynab
which book bought.3fs Zaynab
‘Which book did Zaynab buy?’

206
Clitic-left dislocation and focus constructions
Finally, in line with wh-interrogatives and in contrast with CLLD, the number
of focused phrases in a given clause is limited to one. Thus, the unacceptability
of (47) parallels that of (48), which involves multiple wh-fronting.9 However, the
sentences in (47) contrast with (49a) and (8a) (repeated below as (49b)).
(47)
a. *nahaar-an zaynab-a
zaara
zayd-un
Standard Arabic
day-Acc
Zaynab-Acc visited.3ms Zayd-Nom
‘It was by day that Zayd visited Zaynab.’
b. *bi-n-nhaar zaynab zaar

‘It was in the day that Zayd visited Zaynab.’
(48)
a. *man man zaara?
Standard Arabic
who

‘Who visited whom?’
b. *min min zaar?
Lebanese Arabic

‘Who visited whom?’
(49)

b. kariim zeina ʕarrafnee-ha
ʕal-ee
Lebanese Arabic
Karim Zeina introduced.1p-her to-him
‘Karim, Zeina, we introduced her to him.’
In section 8.4, we present and discuss Ouhalla’s (1994b) analysis of focus con-
structions, which tries to account for the parallelism between focus fronting con-
structions and wh-interrogatives and explains the relative ordering of focused and
CLLDed elements.
8.3.2
The nature of the fronted focus phrases
A clear contrast can be observed between the nature of the fronted focus
phrases and that of CLLD NPs: whereas CLLDed NPs cannot be indeﬁnite, as
9 Note that Arabic allows multiple wh-questions as illustrated below:
(i)
a. man zaara
man
Standard Arabic
who visited.3ms who
‘Who visited whom?’
b. min zaar
min
Lebanese Arabic
who visited.3ms who
‘Who visited whom?’

8.3 Focus constructions in Arabic
207
observed in section 8.2.2, fronted focus NPs can, as illustrated in (50), from both
Standard Arabic and Lebanese Arabic.
(50)
a. qaSiidat-un ʔallafa
ʕomar
Standard Arabic
poem-Nom wrote.3ms Omar
‘A poem, Omar wrote.’
b. ʔaSiide ʔallaf
ʕomar
Lebanese Arabic
poem
wrote.3ms Omar
‘A poem, Omar wrote.’
Similar facts obtain with kam NP ‘few NP,’ which cannot be CLLDed, but can be
fronted as a focus phrase.10
(51)
a. *kam siyyara ˇzeebuw-a/un
min almaania
few
car
brought.3p-it/them from Germany
‘Few cars, they brought them from Germany.’
b. kam siyyara ˇzeebo
min almaania miˇs ktiir
few car
brought.3p from Germany not lot
‘It is few cars that they brought from Germany not a lot.’
In addition, since no pronominal clitic is involved, focus fronting is not reduced
to NPs, but can affect PPs and VPs, as well as APs (52–54).
(52)
a. baʕd l-ʁada
rə¯hna
tmaˇsˇsayna
Lebanese Arabic
after the-lunch went.1p walk.1p
‘After lunch, we went walking.’
b. ʕinda-ka
yanamu
zayd-un
Standard Arabic
at-you.ms sleep.3ms Zayd-Nom
‘Zayd sleeps at your house.’
10 It comes as no surprise that ma ¯hada ‘no one’ and maˇsi ‘nothing’ cannot occur as focus
fronted phrases:
(i)
a. *ma ¯hada zaynab ʕazamit
no
one
Zaynab invited.3fs
‘It is no one that Zaynab invited.’
b. *maˇsi
zaynab ʔakalit
nothing Zaynab ate.3fs
‘It is nothing that Zaynab ate.’
If in those constructions, the non-focused material is part of the assertion, then a sentence
like (ia), for instance, would be asserting that Zaynab invited someone and then asserting
that it was no one, hence the intuition that by uttering (ia) one would be uttering a
contradiction.

8.3.3
Focus fronting and island sensitivity
Another contrast that we can observe between focus fronting construc-
tions and CLLD is that focus fronting, unlike CLLD, displays island effects: a left
peripheral focused phrase in Lebanese Arabic may not be related to a gap within
an adjunct clause (55), a complex NP (56), or a wh-island (57).
(55)
Adjunct clause
*sməʕt
ʔənno naadia rə¯hte
mən duun ma
tˇsuufe
heard.1s that
Nadia left.2fs without
Comp see.2fs
‘I heard that Nadia, you left without seeing.’
(56)
Complex NP island
*sməʕt ʔənno ha-l-kteeb
¯hkiite
maʕ z-zalame yalli katab
heard.1s that

‘I heard that this book, you talked with the man that wrote.’
(57)
Wh-island
*sməʕt
ʔənno naadia byaʕrfo ʔayya walad ˇseef
heard.1s that
Nadia know.3p which boy
saw.3ms
‘I heard that Nadia, they know which boy saw.’
The paradigm above shows that, unlike CLLD, focus fronting is sensitive to
islands. This observation places focus fronting on a par with other A′-constructions
involving gaps, like wh-interrogatives, for instance (see chapter 6).
8.4
Analyses of focus fronting and CLLD in Arabic
Summing up what needs to be accounted for with respect to CLLD and
focus fronting in Arabic, we have the following generalizations:

8.4 Analyses of focus fronting and CLLD in Arabic
209
(58)
a. Focus phrases, when fronted, are related to gaps inside the sentence,
while CLLDed phrases are related to a pronominal clitic.
b. Focus constructions are sensitive to island constraints, while CLLD
constructions are not.
c. There can be only one focused phrase in a given clause, while there
are no such limitations on the number of CLLDed elements in a
given clause.
d. A fronted focus phrase bears the case marking of its corresponding
gap, whereas a CLLDed phrase generally bears Nominative Case.
e. Focus fronting, unlike CLLD, triggers subject–verb inversion in
Standard Arabic.
f. In Standard Arabic, focus phrases must follow CLLDed elements.
This does not extend, however, to some of the other modern dialects
of Arabic, like Lebanese Arabic, for instance.
Furthermore, Ouhalla draws a parallel between focus fronting and wh-questions
based on the generalizations in (58a), (58d), and (58e). It can also be noted that
wh-interrogatives as well as focus fronting constructions are sensitive to islands
(58b). In addition, the ﬁrst three of the generalizations in (58) apply across the
dialects of Arabic; however, there is dialectal variation with respect to the last
three generalizations.
Based on the parallelism between wh-questions and focus fronting, Ouhalla
argues for a movement analysis of focus fronting. The contrasts between focus
fronting constructions and CLLD constructions are accounted for by a base-
generation analysis for CLLD. Ouhalla (1994b) assumes that focus fronting con-
structions involve the generation of a designated projection between CP and TP –
he calls it FP, for focus phrase – which hosts elements marked for focus. This
projection is headed by an abstract head F, bearing the [+F] feature, which on a
par with the [+Q(uestion)] feature on C, needs to be identiﬁed. The identiﬁcation
of the [+F] feature is done either by moving a phrase bearing the [+F] feature to
the speciﬁer position of FP or by merging a head bearing the [+F] feature with the
head of FP, a process that Ouhalla refers to as morphological identiﬁcation. Thus,
sentences like those in (33), repeated below as (59), would have the following
derivation:
(59)
a. ˇsay-an ˇsariba
zayd-un
Standard Arabic
tea-Acc drank.3ms Zayd-Nom
‘It was tea that Zayd drank.’
b. ˇsay ˇsərib
zayd
Lebanese Arabic
tea drank.3ms Zayd
‘It was tea that Zayd drank.’

210
Clitic-left dislocation and focus constructions
If FP is projected, then the phrase ˇsay-an/ˇsay ‘tea,’ generated in the canonical
object position bearing the [+F] feature, moves to [Spec, FP] for identiﬁcation of
the [+F] feature on F. If FP is not projected, there would be no reason to move,
and hence the focus marked element remains in situ, as illustrated in (32), repeated
below as (60).
(60)
a. ˇsariba
zayd-un
ˇsay-an
Standard Arabic
drank.3ms Zayd-Nom tea-Acc
‘Zayd drank TEA.’
b. ˇsərib
zayd ˇsay
Lebanese Arabic
drank.3ms Zayd tea
‘Zayd drank TEA.’
Standard Arabic, according to Ouhalla, has a set of muʔakkidaat, particles that can
be analyzed as focus markers (FM). When one of these particles is merged with
the head of FP, the result is that the focus phrase remains in situ and movement is
again prohibited in those constructions (61).
(61)
laqad ˇsariba
zayd-un
ˇsay-an
FM
drank.3ms Zayd-Nom tea-Acc
‘Zayd DID drink tea.’
Ouhalla (1994b), citing Moutaouakil (1989), further points out that sentences
involving focus markers like laqad in (61) “convey information which contra-
dicts the information possessed by the addressee, and, therefore, are instances
of contrastive focus” (p. 75). In such contexts as well, a parallel can be drawn
between focus fronting and question formation in Arabic: Standard Arabic pos-
sesses question particles that morphologically identify the sentence as a yes-no
question without disturbing the canonical word order of the sentence, as illustrated
in (62).
(62)
hal raʔat
mona zayd-an?
QM saw.3fs Mona Zayd-Acc
‘Did Mona see Zayd?’
Under a movement analysis of focus fronting, the presence of a gap, the sensi-
tivity to island constraints, and the case properties of the fronted focus phrase are
readily accounted for. The analysis of focus fronting along the lines of Ouhalla
(1994b) also explains the restriction on the number of focus phrases in a given
clause. Since focus fronting is triggered by the identiﬁcation of the [+F] feature in
FP, once this feature is identiﬁed, the motivation behind the movement disappears
and hence further movement is prohibited (Procrastinate; Chomsky 1995).

8.4 Analyses of focus fronting and CLLD in Arabic
211
Shlonsky (2000:331) offers a different analysis to account for the number
restriction on focus phrases in Arabic. He bases his analysis on the prohibition
in (63).
(63)
A focus cannot be embedded under another focus.
Shlonsky’s (2000) account is put forth to explain the incompatibility observed
between questions and focus fronting ((39) and (40) are repeated below as (64)
and (65)).

If question formation is a speciﬁc instance of focalization, then the constraint
in (63) accounts for the data in (64–65). However, as Ouhalla (1994b) points out,
the constraint in (63) is too strong and would rule out sentences like those in (66),
where a focus phrase clearly co-occurs with a question in an embedded clause.

‘We want to know to whom it was that Karim was introduced.’
Thus it can be observed that the incompatibility of questions with focus and the
uniqueness restriction on focus phrases holds at the level of the clause and not the
whole sentence. Ouhalla’s (1994b) account of those restrictions relies on Tsimpli’s
(1990 and 1995) analysis of Modern Greek. The analysis relies on the assumption
that root clauses lack a CP, and the category C is claimed to be a selected category.
Thus, in root clauses FP is the highest functional projection, and focus phrases as
well as wh-elements move to its speciﬁer position. The incompatibility between

212
Clitic-left dislocation and focus constructions
wh-questions and focus fronting then reduces to the fact that both wh-elements
and fronted focus phrases target the same position, namely [Spec, FP].
The contrasts observed between focus fronting and CLLD are argued to be
the result of the difference in how focus fronting constructions and CLLD con-
structions are derived. Whereas focus fronting involves movement to a speciﬁer
position, CLLD, according to Ouhalla, involves base-generation of the CLLDed
phrase in a position adjoined to the highest functional projection in the clause
and related to a pronominal clitic in the sentence.11 This base-generation analysis
of CLLD readily accounts for the case properties of CLLDed elements and for
the absence of island effects in those constructions. Furthermore, the uniqueness
requirement does not apply in the context of CLLD since those constructions do
not involve a designated position in the tree structure. Since base-generation and
adjunction are free, the number of CLLDed elements does not have to be limited
to one. Ouhalla’s analysis also accounts for the relative ordering of fronted focus
elements and CLLDed elements. Since the latter are adjoined to FP, and fronted
focus phrases land in [Spec, FP], it follows that CLLDed elements will always
precede fronted focus phrases.
Shlonsky (2000) further proposes a constraint that accounts for subject–verb
inversion in fronted focus constructions. Following Bakir (1980), he claims that
the verb in focus constructions needs to be adjacent to the element bearing the
focus feature. Hence, the verb in those constructions must move to F, in order to
be adjacent to the fronted focus phrase in [Spec, FP]. This adjacency requirement
explains why wh-questions trigger subject–verb inversion as well, if wh-questions
are taken to be a subclass of focus constructions. It is, however, interesting to
note that this analysis applies only to Standard Arabic, where the adjacency
requirement is observed, and not to Lebanese Arabic, where fronted focus phrases
can be separated from the verb and where there is no relative ordering between
CLLDed elements and fronted focus phrases.
Whereas Ouhalla’s (1994b) analysis of focus fronting captures the generaliza-
tions concerning those constructions, his analysis of CLLD constructions faces
problems in accounting for the dialectal variations observed with respect to those
constructions. First, it rules out the possibility of having the fronted focus phrase
precede the CLLDed material, a case we have observed in Lebanese Arabic, and
more importantly, it presents CLLD constructions as a uniﬁed class by claiming
11 Ouhalla uses the term topic to refer to what we have been calling CLLD, but for
consistency we will continue to refer to topics as CLLDed elements. Furthermore, it
would be more accurate to refer to the adjunction site of the topic/CLLDed element as
FP since it has been observed that, in embedded clauses, the topic/CLLDed element
follows the complementizer and hence clearly does not adjoin to the highest functional
projection of the clause, which would be CP, in those cases.

that all those constructions are base-generated. We will see in chapter 9 that CLLD
constructions, although involving resumption, can be generated by movement, and
therefore Ouhalla’s (1994b) analysis for those constructions is not sufﬁcient to
account for the range of data we can observe in the various dialects of Arabic.
8.5
Conclusion
In this chapter we have examined two A′-constructions in Arabic: CLLD
and focus fronting. By comparing and contrasting their properties, we were able to
conclude ﬁrst that focus fronting constructions share many properties with gapped
wh-interrogatives: both construction types involve a gap within the sentence,
which is related to a phrase in the left periphery. Both are triggered by the need
to identify a feature – [+F] – generated on the head of a functional projection –
FP – located between CP and TP. Following Ouhalla (1994b), we suggested that
the sentence initial phrase in both types of constructions targets the same position,
[Spec, FP], which explains why focus fronted phrases and fronted wh-phrases do
not co-occur in simple sentences. Furthermore, both focus fronting constructions
and wh-interrogatives are sensitive to islands.
CLLD, unlike focus fronting, involves resumption. Whereas only one phrase
can be fronted as a focus phrase, more than one phrase can be CLLDed in a given
sentence. Like resumptive wh-interrogatives, CLLD shows no island sensitivity,
and the notion of referentiality does not adequately constrain the set of noun
phrases that can be CLLDed. We have also observed that, in some dialects of
Arabic (for instance, Standard Arabic), there are requirements imposed on the
relative ordering of CLLDed and focus fronted phrases. This requirement is absent
in other dialects of Arabic (for instance, Lebanese Arabic). In chapter 9, we further
investigate this requirement and evaluate the various analyses that have been put
forth to account for it.

The syntax of the Arabic left periphery
9.1
Introduction
In the previous chapter we examined brieﬂy the interaction between
CLLD and focus fronting in Arabic. The following generalization was uncovered:
(1)
Interaction between CLLD and focus fronting
In Standard Arabic, focus phrases must follow CLLDed elements. This
does not extend however to some of the other modern dialects of
Arabic, like Lebanese Arabic, for instance.
In Ouhalla (1994b), the relative ordering between fronted focus phrases and
CLLDed phrases in Standard Arabic was attributed to the positions that each
type of phrase occupies in the tree structure: while fronted focus phrases tar-
get [Spec, FP], CLLDed phrases are base-generated adjoined to FP. It was also
noted that while Ouhalla’s analysis accounted for the facts of Standard Arabic,
it couldn’t be extended to Lebanese Arabic, where the restriction on the rela-
tive ordering between fronted focus elements and CLLDed elements does not
apply.
In this chapter, we take a closer look at the ordering of focused and CLLDed
elements in the left periphery of the Arabic sentence. In order to provide a more
adequate analysis for the relative ordering of these elements in the A′-domain, we
need to expand the data paradigms to include more complex sentences. Following
Shlonsky (2000) and Rizzi (1997), we propose a “split-CP” analysis of the left
periphery where both focused elements and CLLDed elements have designated
positions: fronted focused elements target [Spec, FP], as in Ouhalla (1994b),
whereas CLLDed elements target [Spec, TopP], the speciﬁer of topic phrases,
which are projected at several points in the structure. We also show that in order
to account for the observed cross-dialectal difference between Standard Arabic
and Lebanese Arabic, we have to appeal to the derivational history of the sentence
(Aoun and Benmamoun 1998).

Revisiting focus fronting and CLLD
The contrast between Standard Arabic and Lebanese Arabic with respect
to the relative ordering of fronted focus phrases and CLLDed phrases was illus-
trated in chapter 8 ((41) and (42) from chapter 8 are repeated below).

b. zeina ʕa kariim ʕarrafnee-ha

‘It is to Karim that we introduced Zeina.’
It is clear that Ouhalla’s (1994b) adjunction analysis of CLLD does not ade-
quately account for the ordering possibilities between CLLDed elements and focus
elements in Lebanese Arabic, since it predicts the ordering in Standard Arabic to
be the only one available.
Interestingly, Shlonsky (2000), following Rizzi (1997), proposes a cartography
of the left periphery that can easily accommodate the Lebanese Arabic data. Thus,
according to Shlonsky (2000), the traditional CP projection may be better viewed
as several distinct heads, ordered as in (4).
(4)
ForceP > TopP > FP > TopP > FinP
ForceP is the projection where the (illocutionary) force of the sentence is marked.
That is, the head of ForceP marks the sentence as an assertion, a question, etc.
FinP stands for TP; it is where the tense features are projected. As can be further
noted, the focus phrase (FP) is sandwiched between two topic phrases (TopP),
which are the projections that typically host CLLDed elements. Thus, a sentence
structure that adheres to the ordering in (4) will have available two potential sites
for CLLDed elements, for instance. In the Lebanese Arabic sentences in (3), it
can be said that while (3a) instantiates a representation where TopP precedes FP,

216
The syntax of the Arabic left periphery
(3b) instantiates a representation where the CLLDed NP occupies the speciﬁer
position of the lower TopP.
In light of the contrast in (2), this account immediately raises the question of
why the lower TopP cannot be instantiated in Standard Arabic. Shlonsky’s (2000)
answer to that question is given in the form of a constraint that states that focus
phrases need to be adjacent to the verb (see also Bakir 1980). This adjacency
requirement also accounts for subject–verb inversion in Standard Arabic wh-
questions under the assumption that those constructions are a subclass of focus
constructions. What we can add here in order to make Shlonsky’s analysis ﬁt with
the Lebanese Arabic data in (3) is that this adjacency requirement is not at work in
Lebanese Arabic. This would be consistent with what we observe in wh-questions
in Lebanese Arabic, where subject–verb inversion is not required (5).

‘When did Karim see Mona?’
b. ʔeemta ˇseef

‘When did Karim see Mona?’
However, a closer look at the interaction between CLLD and focus fronting in
Lebanese Arabic shows that the story does not end with the adjacency requirement.
More speciﬁcally, Aoun and Benmamoun (1998) show that, despite the absence of
an adjacency requirement between a fronted focus phrase and the verb in Lebanese
Arabic, there are still contexts where a focused phrase cannot precede a CLLDed
phrase. That is, the data in (2) and (3) cannot be accounted for by appealing to this
adjacency requirement.
It turns out that, in Lebanese Arabic, focus fronting across a CLLDed NP is
possible only if the CLLDed NP is not separated from its corresponding clitic by
an island (6–7).

The constructions in (6–7) signiﬁcantly contrast with ones in which the focused
phrase is fronted across a CLLDed NP related to a clitic within a complex NP
island (8), an adjunct clause (9), or a wh-island (10).1

1 Although the link between the fronted focus phrase and its trace, and the one between
the CLLDed element and its corresponding clitic, cross paths in (10), the unacceptability
of those sentences cannot be attributed to a prohibition against crossing given that in the
sentences in (8–9), the links between the fronted elements and their corresponding gap
or resumptive clitic do not cross.

Summing up, fronted focus phrases do not display a uniform behavior with
respect to their interaction with CLLDed NPs. Focus fronting across a CLLDed
NP related to a clitic within an island is consistently ruled out (11b). On the
other hand, focus movement across a CLLDed NP that is not separated from its
corresponding clitic by an island is possible (11a).

It can also be pointed out that the contrast observed in (6–10) obtains regardless
of whether the CLLDed NP and the focused phrase occur within the same clause
or in separate clauses.
In contrast with focus fronting, CLLD across another CLLD phrase, a focused
phrase, or a wh-phrase is acceptable, as illustrated in the sentences in (12).

This is also true if the lower CLLDed phrase or the wh-phrase are related to a
resumptive element inside an island (13).

What we have seen here shows that the facts about the interaction between
focus fronting and CLLD in Lebanese Arabic are more complicated that they ﬁrst
appear to be: CLLDed elements can co-occur with focused phrases, only if the
CLLDed element precedes the focus, or, in case the focused phrase precedes the
CLLDed element, the latter must be related to a resumptive outside an island.
9.3
A minimality account
To account for the complex interaction observed between focus fronting
and CLLD in Lebanese Arabic, Aoun and Benmamoun (1998) cast their analysis
within Chomsky’s Minimalist Program and, relying on the availability of move-
ment in CLLD constructions, they offer an account of the interaction between
focus fronting and CLLD in terms of minimality (Rizzi 1990; Chomsky 1995).
9.3.1
Two representations for CLLD constructions
Aoun and Benmamoun (1998) point out that CLLD constructions that do
not involve islands could actually correspond to two different representations: one
where the clitic is coindexed with a lexical NP that can later undergo movement
(15a), and another where the clitic is coindexed with a null pronominal that is
related to a base-generated CLLDed NP (15b). This latter conﬁguration gives rise
to standard resumptive constructions where a preposed NP binds a pronominal
clitic within an island (16).

Aoun and Benmamoun argue that (15a) is a representation that must be added
to the inventory of representations available to resumptive constructions. This
representation patterns with the standard gap strategy (17), in that they both
involve movement to the left periphery.
(17)
Constructions with the gap strategy
XPi . . . ti . . .
The representation in (17) is available to standard A′-constructions involving
gaps. Representation (15a) differs from (17) only in that the moved element in
the former is coindexed with a pronominal element, the clitic. This distinction
is attributed to the presence of a Cl(itic) P(rojection) in (15a) but not in (17)
(Sportiche 1998:244–307). A lexical NP generated in the speciﬁer position of ClP
may not remain there. Borrowing Sportiche’s analysis of clitic constructions in
Romance, Aoun and Benmamoun attribute this generalization to a generalized
Doubly Filled Speciﬁer/Head Filter that applies at the level of ClP. In that case,
the lexical NP has to vacate this speciﬁer position, leaving a gap.
To argue for the existence of (15a) as a representation for resumptive con-
structions, Aoun and Benmamoun make use of reconstruction. Assuming that
reconstruction is a property of chains generated by movement (Hornstein 1984;
Barss 1986; Chomsky 1993), they show that it applies in CLLD constructions that
can be given the representation in (15a). Furthermore, as expected, CLLDed NPs
related to a clitic within an island – which have the representation in (15b) – don’t
display reconstruction effects.
9.3.2
Reconstruction effects in CLLD
CLLD constructions are shown to display reconstruction effects in the
context of pronominal binding. Aoun and Benmamoun provide the following
contrast to illustrate this point:2
(18)
a. təlmiiz-[a]i ˇs-ˇsiTaan
btaʕrfo
ʔənno [kəll mʕallme]i
student-her the-naughty know.2p that
every teacher
ʔaaSaSət-o
punished.3fs-him
‘Her naughty student, you know that every teacher punished him.’
2 The same facts illustrated in (18b) using an adjunct clause can be shown using other types
of islands, like wh-islands or complex NP islands.

9.3 A minimality account
221
b. *təlmiiz-[a]i ˇs-ˇsiTaan
fallayto ʔabl
ma
[kəll mʕallme]i
student-her
the-naughty left.2p
before Comp. every teacher
tʔaaSəs-o
punish.3fs-him
‘Her naughty student, you left before every teacher punished him.’
In (18a), the quantiﬁer phrase (QP) kəll mʕallme ‘every teacher’ can bind the
pronoun within the CLLDed NP təlmiiza ˇs-ˇsiTaan ‘her naughty student.’ Assuming
that bound pronouns must be c-commanded at LF by the operators that bind them
(Chomsky 1976; Higginbotham 1980; Hornstein and Weinberg 1990), the relevant
reading in (18a) then follows from the reconstruction of the CLLDed NP containing
the bound pronoun below the subject QP. As expected, the pronoun in (18b) cannot
be interpreted as bound by the QP within the adjunct clause. This is because the
CLLDed NP containing the pronoun to be bound is related to a clitic within an
island. Since extraction from islands is not possible, the CLLDed NP in (18b) does
not reconstruct under the QP since reconstruction is a property of chains created
by movement.
Thus, CLLD constructions do not behave uniformly with respect to reconstruc-
tion: CLLDed elements that are not separated from their corresponding clitics by
an island reconstruct; the others do not. Aoun and Benmamoun (1998) account for
this observation by linking it to the presence of movement in constructions that
display reconstruction and its absence from those that don’t.
9.3.3
Interception in Lebanese Arabic
The facts about the interaction between CLLD constructions and focus
movement indicate that when CLLDed elements are separated from their corre-
sponding clitic by an island, focus fronting across those elements is unacceptable
in Lebanese Arabic (19).
(19)
a. . . . (Focus-NP/PP)i . . . CLLDed-NPj . . . V+Cliticj . . . ti . . .
b. *. . . (Focus-NP/PP)i . . . CLLDed-NPj . . . [Island . . . cliticj . . . ] . . . ti
Aoun and Benmamoun link the contrast observed in (19) to the fact that CLLD
constructions do not form a natural class with respect to the availability of move-
ment ((15a) and (15b) are repeated here).
(20)
a. CLLDed-NPj . . . ti-X+clitic . . .
b. CLLDed-NPj . . . proi-X+clitic . . .
Thus, Aoun and Benmamoun analyze the difference between the two types of
CLLDed elements in their relation to focus fronting in terms of interception.
Speciﬁcally,

222
The syntax of the Arabic left periphery
(21)
a. A moved CLLDed NP (20a) reconstructs and therefore does not
intercept focus fronting (19a).
b. A base-generated CLLDed NP (20b) cannot reconstruct and
therefore intercepts focus fronting (19b).
Brieﬂy, Aoun and Benmamoun’s analysis takes the derivational history of a CLLD
construction to be the key element for explaining the interaction between CLLDed
and focus fronted phrases.
To illustrate how their analysis works, consider the ill-formed sentence in (22).
(22)
*nəkte sməʕt
ʔənno naadia xabbaro S-Sabe yalli byaʕrəf-a
joke
heard.2ms that
Nadia told.3p
the-boy that know.3ms-her
‘A joke, you heard that Nadia, they told the boy that knows her.’
In (22) focus fronting has applied across a CLLDed NP related to a clitic within a
complex NP island, as given in the representation in (23).
(23)
*[Focus-NP/PP]i . . . CLLDed-NPj . . . V . . . [Island . . .
proj-V+Clitic] . . . ti
In this context the CLLDed element is base-generated in its surface position. No
reconstruction of the CLLDed element can take place; hence, focus movement is
intercepted.
On the other hand, the well-formed sentences in (24) have the representation
in (25).
(24)
a. nəkte naadia xabbaruw-a
joke
Nadia told.3p-her
‘A joke, Nadia they told her.’
b. ʕan
l-masra¯hiyye naadia ¯hkitii-la

Nadia told.2p-her.Dat.
‘About the play, Nadia, you told her.’
(25)
[Focus-NP/PP]i . . . CLLDed-NPj . . . tj-V+Clitic . . . ti
In this representation, the CLLDed NP, derived by movement, binds a trace. At LF,
the CLLDed NP is reconstructed, and thus will not intercept the focused phrase.
The alternative representation (26), in which the CLLDed NP is base-generated
and binds a pronominal, is ill-formed: since it is not derived by movement, the
CLLDed NP cannot reconstruct, and focus movement will be intercepted.
(26)
*[Focus-NP/PP]i . . . CLLDed-NPj . . . proj-V+Clitic . . . ti
Two assumptions underlie Aoun and Benmamoun’s discussion of the interaction
between CLLD and focus fronting: (a) the surface position of the CLLDed element

9.3 A minimality account
223
is an A′-position. Therefore, if the CLLDed element does not reconstruct, it can
intercept another A′-element, namely a focused phrase; the interception of focus
fronting by CLLD is the result of a minimality effect (see Rizzi 1990; Chomsky
1993, 1994; Aoun and Li 1993a, b). (b) The position to which the CLLDed
element reconstructs is an A-position. In that case, focus fronting is not intercepted;
minimality therefore does not apply.
9.3.4
Interception and binding
Aoun and Benmamoun provide further support for their analysis of the
interaction between CLLD and focus fronting in terms of interception by exam-
ining pronominal binding in those contexts. Consider the following paradigm
illustrating the well-known generalization that CLLD extends the binding possi-
bilities of a given sentence (see Zubizarreta 1992 and 1998, among others).3
(27)
a. ʕaTit
S-Sabe yalli naadia htammit ﬁ-i

‘She gave the boy that Nadia took care of pants.’

ʕaTit-o
ˇsirweel
the-boy that Nadia
cared.3fs in-him gave.3fs-him pants
‘The boy that Nadia took care of him, she gave him pants.’
In (27a), the NP Nadia contained within the direct object in its canonical postverbal
position cannot be coreferential with the pronominal subject of the main verb
3 The facts in (27b) seem to go against what has been observed in Italian by Cinque (1990)
(see also footnote 2, in chapter 8). Recall that in Italian CLLD constructions, there is
obligatory connectivity between the CLLDed element and the IP internal position with
respect to Binding Theory, as illustrated in (i).
(i)
A *lei/se stessa Maria non ci
pensa
of her/herself
Maria not there thinks
‘Of herself, Maria does not think.’
In light of Aoun and Benmamoun’s proposal, it is possible to deal with the facts illustrated
in (i) by claiming that only movement is available in the generation of Italian CLLD. This
option is supported by the fact that CLLD constructions in Italian seem to be sensitive to
islands (Cinque 1990):
(ii)
*[A casa]i lo
abbiamo incontrato [PP prima che ci andasse]
Home
him have.1p met
before that there went-he
‘At home, we met him before he went there.’
Alternatively, if we were to say that base-generation is also available for CLLD construc-
tions in Italian, then the reported connectivity facts would have to be dealt with without
appealing to movement.

The syntax of the Arabic left periphery
ʕaTit ‘she gave.’ Given the hierarchical relation between subjects and objects, this
observation can be attributed to a violation of Principle C: the pronominal subject
c-commands the name Nadia and hence they cannot corefer. In (27b), which
involves a preposed CLLDed object however, the coreferential reading is possible.
This is taken to indicate that the CLLDed NP in (27b) does not reconstruct. Based
on the observation that CLLDed elements that do not reconstruct intercept focus
movement, it is expected that in contexts similar to (27), tension will arise between
reconstruction and binding.
(28)

‘Pants, the boy that Nadia took care of him, she gave him.’
Example (28) is unacceptable under the reading where Nadia is coreferential with
the main clause pronominal subject, but acceptable otherwise. Aoun and Ben-
mamoun consider two possibilities for (28): either the CLLDed NP reconstructs
or it does not. If it reconstructs, the focused phrase is not intercepted; however, a
binding violation occurs if Nadia and the pronominal subject are coreferential. On
the other hand, if the CLLDed NP does not reconstruct, Nadia and the pronom-
inal subject can corefer, but the focused phrase is intercepted. The facts in (27)
and (28) are consistent with Aoun and Benmamoun’s analysis and hence provide
added conﬁrmation for it.
9.4
Interaction between focus fronting and CLLD in Standard Arabic
Recall that in Standard Arabic, unlike Lebanese Arabic, focus fronting
across a CLLDed element is always unacceptable. We have seen that in Lebanese
Arabic the unacceptability of such sentences is related to the derivational history
of the sentence and whether the CLLDed element is generated by movement or
not. More precisely, when the CLLDed element is base-generated, moving a focus
phrase across it is prohibited. This analysis may be extended to account for the
facts observed in Standard Arabic on the assumption that, unlike in Lebanese
Arabic, CLLD in Standard Arabic is always base-generated. In that case, CLLD
constructions in Standard Arabic will correspond only to the representation where
the CLLDed element is related to a pronominal clitic inside the sentence (29).
(29)
CLLD constructions in Standard Arabic

Under such an analysis, it is expected that CLLD in Standard Arabic will always
intercept focus fronting; and that is what we have observed. Therefore, even if the
lower topic projection – the one dominated by the focus phrase – were available

9.5 Interception: a constraint on the well-formedness of movement chains?
225
in Standard Arabic, a CLLDed element base-generated in its speciﬁer position
would intercept a fronted focus phrase.
9.5
Interception: a constraint on the well-formedness of
movement chains?
Returning to Lebanese Arabic, the relevant generalizations Aoun and
Benmamoun (1998) try to account for with respect to the interaction between
CLLDed phrases and fronted focus phrases are expressed in (30).
(30)
a. CLLDed NPs derived by movement display reconstruction effects.
b. CLLDed NPs derived by movement do not intercept wh-extraction
or focus movement.
These generalizations were accounted for as follows. A CLLDed element that has
been fronted from the speciﬁer of the clitic projection appears to be (re)located at
LF in the position of its trace within the clitic projection, which can be considered
an A-position. As a result of reconstruction, at LF there no longer is an A′-
element that could intercept the fronting of wh-elements or focused elements.
This account crucially assumes that the minimality constraint is a condition on LF
representations rather than derivations. Otherwise, A′-extraction across a CLLDed
NP would always violate minimality.
By examining the interaction between CLLD and resumptive wh-interrogatives,
Aoun and Benmamoun further show that minimality is a constraint on chains
resulting from movement. It has already been observed (see chapter 6) that wh-
phrases related to resumptive clitics do not obey island constraints, as illustrated
in (31).

‘Which boy did you go before you saw him?’
Interestingly, in (32) where the wh-element is related to a resumptive clitic and
the CLLDed NP is related to a clitic within an island, interception does not apply.

226
The syntax of the Arabic left periphery
That is, even though the CLLD occupies the topic position below the focus phrase
where the wh-phrase is located, the sentence in (32) is perfectly acceptable. Given
the representations available for constructions involving pronominal clitics, the
resumptive element related to the wh-phrase can be taken to indicate the presence
of a pronominal in the corresponding clitic projection, and hence the absence of
movement in the generation of the sentence in (32). Thus the representation of
(32) is as shown in (33).
(33)
wh-NPi . . . CLLDed-NPj . . . [CNP . . . proi-V+Clitic ] . . .
proi-V+Clitic . . .
It follows then that, since the CLLDed element does not intercept the relation
between the wh-phrase and its corresponding clitic, interception applies only to
movement chains. This analysis is conﬁrmed by examining reconstruction in the
following wh-questions.
(34)

The schema in (35) represents the sentences given in (34).
(35)
[wh-NP . . . pronouni]k . . . CLLDed-NPj . . . tj/proj-V+Clitic . . .

In (34a) the bound reading of the pronoun contained within the fronted wh-phrase is
available; according to Aoun and Benmamoun’s analysis, this is a reconstruction
effect. For the bound reading to obtain, the wh-phrase must reconstruct to a
position c-commanded by the QP inside the sentence. Thus the wh-phrase must
be generated by movement. The relationship between the wh-phrase and its trace
is not intercepted by the CLLDed element, since at LF the latter is reconstructed
to the A-position – that is, the speciﬁer position of the clitic to which it is related.

9.6 Interception: a constraint on derivations?
227
In the case that CLLDed element is base-generated in its surface A′-position and
cannot reconstruct, it will intercept the relation between the fronted wh-phrase
and its trace. In that case, the relation between the wh-phrase and its trace will be
intercepted. This is what (34b) illustrates: in (34b) the bound reading that results
from reconstruction is not available.
9.6
Interception: a constraint on derivations?
Aoun and Benmamoun’s account of the interaction between CLLD and
focus fronting leads to the expectation that CLLDed NPs generated by movement
should not be intercepted. The reason is that these moved CLLDed NPs reconstruct.
This expectation is not borne out: it can be shown that CLLD is not immune to
interception. That is, moving a CLLDed NP across another CLLDed NP, or for
that matter across a wh-phrase or a fronted focus phrase, is consistently ill-formed,
as schematized in (36) and illustrated in the Lebanese Arabic sentences in (37).4

4 The representations in (36) differ systematically from those in (14) in that they clearly
involve movement of the CLLDed NP.

228
The syntax of the Arabic left periphery
In these sentences, the QP subject kəll mʕallme ‘every teacher’ in the embedded
clause cannot bind the pronoun contained within the CLLDed NP Saa¯həbta ‘her
friend’: binding the pronoun requires reconstruction of the CLLDed NP, in order
for c-command to obtain between the QP subject and the pronoun. Since only
elements derived by movement can undergo reconstruction, it follows that the
CLLDed NP must have been extracted across the embedded CLLDed NP, the
wh-phrase, or the fronted focus phrase. The unavailability of a bound reading
in (37a–c) indicates that CLLDed elements that are moved are intercepted. This
conclusion is further conﬁrmed by the fact that, in the absence of an intervening
A′-element, the bound reading of the pronoun contained within the CLLDed NP
is available (38).

Aoun and Benmamoun argue that the facts in this section would not come as a
surprise if minimality is understood as a constraint on syntactic derivations rather
than a constraint on LF representations.
In brief, an analysis that considers minimality to be a constraint on LF represen-
tations will not account for the fact that a CLLDed element cannot move across
another CLLDed element, a wh-element, or a focus phrase. On the other hand, an
analysis that considers minimality to be a constraint on derivations will account for
the fact that a moved CLLDed element is intercepted by an intervening CLLDed
element, a wh-element, or a focus phrase. However, with the derivational account
of minimality we lose the explanation for why a CLLDed NP does not always
intercept focus fronting in Lebanese Arabic. Therefore, under the assumption that
the interception effects observed so far in the interaction between CLLD and focus
are to be accounted for as minimality violations, the conclusion is that minimality,
whether construed as a constraint on derivations or on LF representations, cannot
account for all the generalizations.
Underlying the discussion so far has been the assumption that movement in
CLLD constructions is on a par with movement in wh-interrogatives and focus
fronting. Aoun and Benmamoun call into question this assumption, suggesting that
CLLD movement is a post-spell-out operation taking place in the PF component of
the grammar. Assuming that extraction of a CLLDed element is a PF operation, the
issue of why such a PF operation does not intercept the extraction of a wh-element
or a focus phrase does not arise. Pre-spell-out, the CLLDed element is still in ClP,

9.7 Broad subject constructions revisited
229
an A-position, and therefore not in a position that can intercept the movement
of a wh-element or a moved phrase. On the other hand, a CLLDed element that
binds a pronominal is generated in a dislocated A′-position and intercepts both
wh-extraction and focus movement.5
This proposal also accounts for the “reconstruction” effects that CLLD con-
structions display. In a generative model that considers that PF operations do not
feed LF operations, the movement of a CLLDed element in the PF component will
have no LF import. That is, in the LF component, the PF fronted CLLDed element
is located in ClP; hence the “reconstruction” effects. On the other hand, a CLLDed
element directly generated in the dislocated A′-position binds a pronominal and
will not display “reconstruction.”
In addition, since fronted CLLDed elements are intercepted by other CLLDed
elements, wh-elements, and fronted focus phrases, it is possible to assume that they
are intercepted by elements in an A′-position and that minimality constrains PF-
movement as well as movement in syntax proper. Within a minimalist framework,
this result can be obtained if minimality is considered to be part of the formulation
of the operation Move: minimality applies whenever Move applies, as argued in
Chomsky (1995).6
9.7
Broad subject constructions revisited
So far we have seen that the left periphery in Arabic comprises at least
three projections hierarchically ordered such that a topic phrase which hosts
CLLDed elements dominates a focus phrase, which hosts fronted focus phrases
(and wh-phrases) and which, in turn, dominates another topic phrase. Both topic
phrases seem to be available for CLLD in Lebanese Arabic, except when the
CLLD element is related to a resumptive clitic in an island and a focus phrase
is fronted to [Spec, FP]. In such contexts, the CLLDed element, if located in the
lower TopP, intercepts the focus phrase. In Standard Arabic, where CLLDed ele-
ments are always base-generated, the speciﬁer of the lower topic phrase cannot be
ﬁlled in the context of focus fronting. That is because a base-generated CLLDed
element will always intercept focus fronting.
5 Assuming that CLLD movement takes place in the PF component of grammar means that
this type of movement has no LF import. It differs from other syntactic movement oper-
ations which result in operator-variable chains, like quantiﬁer raising or wh-movement.
The latter affect scope possibilities in the sentence, which CLLD movement does not
seem to affect.
6 The various island effects that constrain this PF movement are to be incorporated in the
formulation of Move as well (see Chomsky 1995).

230
The syntax of the Arabic left periphery
Alexopoulou, Doron, and Heycock (2004) question the existence of two types
of CLLD constructions: a type that involves movement and displays reconstruction
effects and another type that doesn’t. Instead, they argue for the existence of a
construction with a left peripheral XP related to a pronominal clitic within the
construction that is different from clitic-left dislocation. Those constructions are
called broad subject (BS) constructions (Doron and Heycock 1999).7 Typical
examples of those in Arabic are given in (39–40).
(39)
Standard Arabic
a. al-baytu
alwaanu-hu
zaahiyatun
the-house.Nom colors.Nom-it bright.Nom
‘The house, its colors are bright.’
b. hind-un

alween-o feeʔʕa
the-house colors-it bright
‘The house, its colors are bright.’
b. hind ˇsaʕr-a
Tawiil
Hind hair-her long
‘Hind, her hair is long.’
Thus, broad subjects share with CLLDed NPs the relationship to a clitic inside
the sentence.8
We have observed that Doron and Heycock (1999) present different criteria to
show the parallelism between BSs and canonical subjects, such as the possibility
of embedding both BSs and canonical subjects under the auxiliary kaan (41) (see
also chapter 3).
(41)

taquudu s-sayyaarat-a

‘Zaynab was driving the car.’
7 We discuss broad subject constructions in chapter 3 of this book.
8 However, broad subjects differ from CLLDed NPs in that they are neutral with respect
to information structure. That is, they can be interpreted either as topics or as foci.
Alexopoulou, Doron, and Heycock (2004) take CLLDed NPs to be consistent only
with the discourse function topic and thus incompatible with focal stress and a focus
interpretation.

9.7.1
Broad subjects and CLLD
Taking Romance CLLD as a test case for CLLD, Alexopoulou, Doron,
and Heycock (2004) argue for a distinction between broad subjects and CLLDed
NPs based on the following criteria. First, whereas downward entailing QPs such
as nessuno ‘no one’ or nessun uomo ‘no man’ in Italian cannot occur as CLLDed
elements, their Lebanese equivalents can appear as broad subjects. Thus, the Italian
sentences in (42) contrast with the Lebanese Arabic sentences in (43).
(42)
a. *Nessuno lo
ho
visto
no one
him have.1s seen
‘No one, I have seen him.’
b. *Nessun uomo lo
ho

‘No man, I have seen him.’

‘No child, his hair is long.’
b. ma ¯hada ˇsaʕr-o
Tawiil

‘No one, his hair is long.’
Alexopoulou, Doron, and Heycock thus argue that the fact that downward entailing
QPs such as ma ¯hada ‘no one’ can appear in contexts like (43b) is a clear indication
that such constructions are not CLLD constructions (see also chapter 8).
A second contrast that Alexopoulou, Doron, and Heycock observe between
BS constructions and CLLD is with respect to island violations. Whereas CLLD
constructions cannot violate island constraints in Romance (Cinque 1990), BS
constructions can.9 The examples cited in Alexopoulou, Doron, and Heycock
(2004) are the following:
(44)
a. *A Carlo, ti
parler`o
solo delle
persone che gli
To Carlo you (I) will talk only of-the people
that to-him

appeal
‘To Carlo, I will talk to you only about the people who appeal to him.’
9 Cinque (1990) has used this observation to distinguish between CLLD and left-dislocation
(LD).

b. *A casa, lo

‘Home, we met him before he went there.’
BS constructions on the other hand clearly violate island constraints, as observed
in (45).

ʔəza
ˇsaʕr-a
Tawiil
want-2p know.2p which girl asked.3p whether hair-her long
‘You want to know which girl they asked if her hair was long.’
Alexopoulou, Doron, and Heycock conclude that a distinction needs to be made
between CLLD constructions and BS constructions. BS constructions are parallel
to canonical subject–predicate constructions in that the BS is generated in an A-
position, without movement, related to a pronominal element inside the sentence.
Hence, BS constructions can freely violate island conditions. CLLDed NPs on the
other hand are generated by movement of the CLLDed NP to its surface position by
A′-movement. Hence, like other A′-movement constructions CLLD constructions
obey island constraints.
Revisiting Aoun and Benmamoun (1998), Alexopoulou, Doron, and Hey-
cock suggest that the two types of CLLD found in Lebanese Arabic are bet-
ter understood if one takes CLLD constructions that do not involve movement
to be instances of BS constructions. Applied to Standard Arabic, this analysis
implies that Standard Arabic has BS constructions but no CLLD constructions.
Then, only those CLLD constructions identiﬁed by Aoun and Benmamoun as
unambiguously involving movement are considered as CLLD constructions by
Alexopoulou, Doron, and Heycock. Thus, sentences involving a fronted negative
quantiﬁer phrase binding a pronominal clitic, as illustrated in (46), would be clear
instances of a BS construction since those quantiﬁer phrases cannot participate in
CLLD.

‘No one, they know whether they released him.’
Given the distinction that Alexopoulou, Doron, and Heycock make between BSs
and CLLDed elements, it comes as no surprise that only those constructions that
are classiﬁed as CLLD constructions display reconstruction effects, as illustrated
in (47).

According to Alexopoulou, Doron, and Heycock, the contrast between (47a) and
(47b) is attributed to the fact that, in (47a), the left peripheral noun phrase is a
CLLDed element generated by movement, whereas in (47b), the left peripheral
element is a BS base-generated in its surface position and hence is not subject to
reconstruction.
9.7.2
Broad subjects and interception
Alexopoulou, Doron, and Heycock note the contrast between extraction
out of a BS construction and extraction out of a CLLD construction as illustrated
in (48a) and (48b) respectively.
(48)
a. *nəkte/ˇsu naadia xabbaro S-Sabe yalli byaʕrif-a

‘A joke/what, Nadia, (did) they told (tell) the boy that knows her.’

naadia smeʕte
ʔənno xabbaruw-a
joke/what Nadia
heard.2fs that
told.3p-her
‘A joke/what, Nadia (did) you heard (hear) that they told her.’
This observation, Alexopoulou, Doron, and Heycock attribute to the fact that BSs,
unlike CLLD constructions, create islands for extraction. Thus, (48a) parallels
(49).
(49)
*addeeˇs feet¯ha l-fəstaan ʔalween-o
how
light.p the-dress colors-its
‘How light are the colors of the dress?’
In (49), as in (48a), a wh-phrase/focus phrase has been extracted out of the predicate
of a BS construction, which is unacceptable. Example (48b) is ambiguous in that

234
The syntax of the Arabic left periphery
it can be given two representations: the left peripheral NP following the focus/wh-
element can be analyzed as either a BS or a CLLDed NP. In the latter case
it wouldn’t create an island for extraction and hence movement of the focused
element or the wh-element past the CLLDed NP is legitimate.
Conﬁrmation for this analysis comes from the fact that if one substitutes a
downward entailing QP for the CLLDed NP in (48b), the sentence becomes
unacceptable, as illustrated in (50).
(50)
*nəkte/ˇsu wala wa¯had smeʕte
ʔənno xabbaru-u
joke/what no
one
heard.2fs that
told.3p-him
‘A joke/what, no one (did) you heard (hear) that they told him.’
The unacceptability of (50) is expected under Alexopoulou, Doron, and Heycock’s
analysis since they assume that downward entailing QPs give rise to BS construc-
tions, but not to CLLD constructions. Hence, when they occur in the left periphery
related to a pronominal clitic within the sentence, they block extraction and will
constitute islands for movement.
Alexopoulou, Doron and Heycock’s claim is that in Aoun and Benmamoun’s
(1998) analysis, data like (50) are not expected since nothing prevents the down-
ward entailing QP from being analyzed as a CLLDed element generated by PF-
movement, and hence the expectation is that, at LF, it is found in its original
A-position where it would not intercept the relation between the wh-element or
the focus phrase and its trace.10
It must be noted however, that in Alexopoulou, Doron, and Heycock’s analysis
of BS constructions, Aoun and Benmamoun’s account for the relation between
CLLD and focus in terms of interception cannot be maintained. The reason for
this is that, like canonical subjects, BSs are in fact considered to be generated in
A-positions and are therefore not expected to interfere in the relationship between
an A′-element and its trace. Consequently, the reason why BS constructions, but
not CLLD, create islands for extraction is not discussed by Alexopoulou, Doron,
and Heycock.
There is also doubt that one should group, under one explanation, sentences like
(48a) and sentences like (49). Two reasons militate against such a conclusion. First,
there are ways to extract from a BS construction without yielding an unacceptable
sentence. Thus, observe the contrast between (51a) and (51b):
10 It could be said however that QPs need to form an operator variable chain, relevant for
interpretation at LF and therefore, that negative QPs like wala wa¯had ‘no one’ in (50)
will have to be preposed in the syntax proper, in which case they will intercept focus
fronting.

9.8 Conclusion

(51)
a. *addeeˇs feet¯ha l-fəstaan ʔalween-o

b. ?addeeˇs l-fəstaan feet¯ha ʔalween-o
how

‘How light are the colors of the dress?’
Thus, a BS construction does not seem totally immune to extraction since the
wh-word itself can be extracted, leaving the adjective behind. However, sentences
involving a CLLDed NP related to a pronominal clitic inside an island always
intercepts A′-movement, as was shown earlier.
Furthermore, having noted that BS constructions can occur embedded under
kaan ‘was,’ it can easily be checked that a left peripheral NP related to a pronominal
clitic within an island cannot occur in such contexts (52).

joke.’
In sum, data like (43b) and (49) indicate that there is a case for assuming
the existence of BS constructions alongside CLLD constructions. However, the
argument cannot be made that constructions with left peripheral NPs related to a
clitic within an island are in fact BS constructions rather than CLLD generated
without movement, since the latter lack deﬁning properties of BS constructions.
More research needs to be done in order to identify the position that BSs occupy
in the left periphery.

Conclusion
This chapter was mainly concerned with the interaction of elements
in the left periphery of the Arabic sentence. Starting from the observation that in
Standard Arabic CLLDed elements must precede focus fronted elements, we refute
the analysis that attributes this to the position that each of those elements occupy
in the sentence structure. By examining similar facts in Lebanese Arabic, we show
that the universal “split CP” structure argued for by Rizzi (1997) is also available
in Arabic. However, the explanation for the ordering restrictions between CLLDed

236
The syntax of the Arabic left periphery
and focus elements is shown to be the result of the derivational history of these
elements: whereas focus phrases are fronted by movement, CLLD elements can
be either derived by PF-movement, or they can be base-generated in their surface
position. In the latter case, they intercept focus movement. By contrasting CLLD
constructions with BS constructions, we concluded that, whereas BS constructions
need to be added to the inventory of “resumptive” constructions in Arabic, they
don’t coincide with the set of CLLD constructions that are base-generated, as
claimed in Alexopoulou, Doron, and Heycock (2004).
