Introduction
W
elcome to Cloud Computing For Dummies. You can’t read a technology 
journal or blog — or even your local newspaper — without coming 
upon a reference to cloud computing. While there’s been a lot of debate 
about what cloud computing is and where it’s headed, no one has doubts 
that it is real. 
In fact, we think that cloud computing, in all of its forms, is transforming the 
computing landscape. It will change the way we deploy technology and how 
we think about the economics of computing. We hope this book provides a 
perspective on cloud computing and starts your journey of exploration. 
Cloud computing is more than a service sitting in some remote data center. 
It’s a set of approaches that can help organizations quickly, effectively 
add and subtract resources in almost real time. Unlike other approaches, 
the cloud is as much about the business model as it is about technology. 
Companies clearly understand that technology is at the heart of how they 
operate their businesses. Business executives have long been frustrated 
with the complexities of getting their computing needs met quickly and cost 
effectively. In a sense, cloud computing has started to become mainstream 
because these business executives have forced the issue into the forefront. 
Cloud computing isn’t a quick fix. It requires a lot of thought: Which 
approach is most appropriate for your company? For example, companies 
have to decide if they want to use public (external) cloud services or if they 
want to have private clouds behind their firewalls. How should you architect 
your internal environment to support the cloud? 
The cloud environment itself requires a strong foundation of best practices in 
software development, software architecture, and service management foun­
dations. This strong foundation is especially important because most organi­
zations combine public and private cloud services. You want to be informed 
before you start your search. We think this book will give you the context to 
make informed decisions.

Cloud Computing For Dummies 
About This Book
Cloud computing is a big new area and requires that a lot of people get famil­
iar with it in a fairly short period of time. That’s why we wrote this book. 
Some people may want to get deeper into the technological details, while 
others may care only about the business implications.
We recommend that you read the first five chapters, regardless of how 
deeply you want to wander into the cloud. These chapters give you context 
about the cloud and what’s behind the concept. If you want to begin under­
standing the economics and the available approaches to the cloud, you 
should read the later chapters. 
You can read from cover to cover, but if you’re not that kind of person, but 
we’ve tried to adhere to the For Dummies style of keeping chapters self-con­
tained so you can go straight to the topics that interest you most. Wherever 
you start, we wish you well.
Foolish Assumptions
Try as we might to be all things to all people, when it came to writing this 
book, we had to pick who we thought would be most interested in Cloud 
Computing For Dummies. Here’s who we think you are:
	
✓	You’re smart. You’re no dummy, yet the topic of service oriented 
architecture gives you an uneasy feeling; you can’t quite get your head 
around it, and if you’re pressed for a definition, you might try to change 
the subject.
	
✓	You’re a businessperson who wants little or nothing to do with tech­
nology, but you live in the 21st century and find that you can’t escape 
it. Everybody’s saying, “It’s all about moving to the cloud,” so you think 
that you better find out what they’re talking about.
	
✓	You’re an IT person who knows a heck of a lot about technology, but 
who is new to this cloud stuff. Everybody says it’s something different. 
Once and for all, you want the whole picture.
Whoever you are, welcome. We’re here to help.
How This Book Is Organized
We divide our book into six parts for easy consumption. Feel free to skip 
about.

 Introduction
Part I: Introducing Cloud Computing
In this part, we explain the fundamentals of cloud computing from a business 
and technology perspective. We also introduce you to the major concepts and 
components so you can hold your own in any meaningful cloud conversation.
Part II: Understanding the Nature 
of the Cloud
Part II is for more technically oriented people. In this section, we dive deeper 
into the actual foundational elements of the cloud. 
Part III: Examining the Cloud Elements
What types of clouds are there and how do they work? This part delves into 
areas critical to your cloud plans. 
Part IV: Managing the Cloud
The rubber meets the road right here. A cloud computing environment can’t 
work if it isn’t well managed. This section gives you plenty to think about in 
this critical area. 
Part V: Planning for the Cloud
When you understand what the cloud is all about, you can start planning. 
You need to think about the financial implications of clouds as well as the 
steps that get you going.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
If you’re new to the For Dummies treasure trove, you’re no doubt unfamil­
iar with “The Part of Tens.” In “The Part of Tens,” Wiley editors torture For 
Dummies authors into creating useful bits of information easily accessible in 
lists containing ten (or more) elucidating elements. We started these chap­
ters kicking and screaming but are ultimately very glad they’re here. We think 
you’ll be glad, too.

Where to Go from Here
We’ve created an overview of cloud computing and introduce you to all of its 
significant components. Many of these chapters could be expanded into full-
length books of their own. Cloud computing and the entire distributed tech­
nology landscape is a big focus for us at Hurwitz & Associates, and we invite 
you to visit our site and read our blogs and insights at www.hurwitz.com.

Part I
Introducing Cloud 
Computing

In this part . . .
T
he phrase cloud computing implies something, but 
exactly what is it? In this part, we introduce the con­
cept and provide a simple graphic that describes the lay­
ers of cloud computing. We also examine the value that 
the cloud can bring to your organization and look at some 
of the associated business issues. 

Chapter 1
Grasping the Fundamentals 
In This Chapter
▶	Doing your computing on the cloud
▶	Seeing what the cloud’s made of 
▶	Comparing the cloud to tradition
▶	Driving your business
I
n a dynamic economic environment, your company’s survival may depend 
on your ability to focus on core business and adapt quickly. Yesterday’s 
profitable business model can’t be counted on to translate into future growth 
and profits. As your business adapts to changing government and industry 
regulations, evaluates new business partnerships, and anticipates competi­
tive threats, IT needs to help the business find new ways to respond.
At the same time, plans for change must often be made in the context of lim­
ited resources for finances, people, technology, and power. In this chapter, 
we introduce you to cloud computing — what it is and how it helps compa­
nies rethink how they deploy technology. 
	
While there are a lot of technical considerations, keep in mind the funda­
mental truth: Cloud computing is a business and economic model. Is cloud 
computing a replacement for the traditional data center? The answer is com­
plicated. In some cases, yes; in some cases, no. 
Are we suggesting that the traditional data center goes away to be replaced 
with a cloud? Not necessarily. Sometimes the traditional data center is the 
best fit. However, for business agility and economic reasons, the cloud is 
becoming an increasingly important option for companies. We see cloud 
computing as the foundation for the industrialization of computing. Yes, it is 
that important. 

8
Part I: Introducing Cloud Computing 
Considering Perspectives
In this book, we look at cloud computing from three perspectives: the strat­
egy from both the customer and the provider’s point of view, business and 
economic considerations, and the technical underpinnings. We also examine 
how companies are using the cloud to control IT expenditures as they pre­
pare to move to a service-centric world. 
	
Many players make up the world of cloud computing:
	
✓	The vendors providing applications and enabling technology, infrastruc­
ture, hardware, and integration
	
✓	The partners of these vendors that are creating cloud services offerings 
and providing support services to customers 
 	
✓	The business leaders themselves who are either using or evaluating 
various types of cloud computing offerings
This book addresses each of these audiences because they’re all a fundamen­
tal part of this fabric of the future of computing. 
Computing on the Cloud
What is cloud computing? Cloud computing is the next stage in evolution 
of the Internet. The cloud in cloud computing provides the means through 
which everything — from computing power to computing infrastructure, 
applications, business processes to personal collaboration — can be deliv­
ered to you as a service wherever and whenever you need. 
	
Cloud computing is offered in different forms: 
	
✓	Public clouds 
	
✓	Private clouds 
	
✓	Hybrid clouds, which combine both public and private 
In general the cloud — similar to its namesake of the cumulus type — is fluid 
and can easily expand and contract. This elasticity means that users can 
request additional resources on demand and just as easily deprovision (or 
release) those resources when they’re no longer needed. This elasticity is 
one of the main reasons individual, business, and IT users are moving to the 
cloud. 
In the traditional data center it has always been possible to add and release 
resources. However, this process couldn’t be done in an automated or self-
service manner. 

9
 Chapter 1: Grasping the Fundamentals
This evolution to cloud computing — already underway — can completely 
change the way companies use technology to service customers, partners, 
and suppliers. Some businesses already have IT resources almost entirely 
in the cloud. They feel that the cloud model provides a more efficient, cost-
effective IT service delivery. 
	
This doesn’t mean that all applications, services, and processes will necessar­
ily be moved to the cloud. Many businesses are much more cautious and are 
taking a hard look at their most strategic business processes and intellectual 
property to determine which computing assets need to remain under internal 
company control and which computing assets could be moved to the cloud.
Defining the Cloud
	
The cloud itself is a set of hardware, networks, storage, services, and inter­
faces that enable the delivery of computing as a service. Cloud services include 
the delivery of software, infrastructure, and storage over the Internet (either 
as separate components or a complete platform) based on user demand. 
The world of the cloud has lots of participants:
	
✓	The end user doesn’t really have to know anything about the underly­
ing technology. In small businesses, for example, the cloud provider 
becomes the de facto data center. In larger organizations, the IT organi­
zation oversees the inner workings of both internal resources and exter­
nal cloud resources. 
	
✓	Business management needs to take responsibility for overall gover­
nance of data or services living in a cloud. Cloud service providers must 
provide a predictable and guaranteed service level and security to all 
their constituents. 
	
✓	The cloud service provider is responsible for IT assets and maintenance. 
	
Therefore, we have written this book to include the concerns of all the players 
in the evolving cloud ecosystem.
Cloud services must enable multi-tenancy — different companies sharing the 
same underlying resources. This topic is discussed further in Chapter 12.
	
Companies are finding some important new value in cloud services. The cloud 
can eliminate many of the complex constraints from the traditional computing 
environment, including space, time, power, and cost. 
Cloud services like social networks (such as Facebook or LinkedIn) and 
collaboration tools (like video conferencing, document management, and 
webinars) are changing the way people in businesses access, deliver, and 

10
Part I: Introducing Cloud Computing 
understand information. Cloud computing infrastructures make it easier for 
companies to treat their computing systems as a pool of resources rather 
than a set of independent environments that each has to be managed.
	
Overall, the cloud embodies the following four basic characteristics:
	
✓	Elasticity and the ability to scale up and down
	
✓	Self-service provisioning and automatic deprovisioning
	
✓	Application programming interfaces (APIs)
	
✓	Billing and metering of service usage in a pay-as-you-go model
Each of these characteristics is described in more detail in the following sections.
Elasticity and scalability
The service provider can’t anticipate how customers will use the service. 
One customer might use the service three times a year during peak selling 
seasons, whereas another might use it as a primary development platform for 
all of its applications. 
	
Therefore, the service needs to be available all the time (7 days a week, 24 
hours a day) and it has to be designed to scale upward for high periods of 
demand and downward for lighter ones. Scalability also means that an appli­
cation can scale when additional users are added and when the application 
requirements change. 
This ability to scale is achieved by providing elasticity. Think about the 
rubber band and its properties. If you’re holding together a dozen pens with 
a rubber band, you probably have to fold it in half. However, if you’re trying 
to keep 100 pens together, you will have to stretch that rubber band. Why 
can a single rubber band accomplish both tasks? Simply, it is elastic and so is 
the cloud. 
In Chapter 2, we give you some concrete examples of how providers are 
using this characteristic.
Self-service provisioning
Customers can easily get cloud services without going through a lengthy 
process. The customer simply requests an amount of computing, storage, 
software, process, or other resources from the service provider. Chapter 7 
explains this process in detail. 

11
 Chapter 1: Grasping the Fundamentals
Contrast this on-demand response with the process at a typical data center. 
When a department is about to implement a new application, it has to submit 
a request to the data center for additional computing hardware, software, 
services, or process resources. The data center gets similar requests from 
departments across the company and must sort through all requests and 
evaluate the availability of existing resources versus the need to purchase 
new hardware. After new hardware is purchased, the data center staff has 
to configure the data center for the new application. These internal procure­
ment processes can take a long time, depending on company policies.
	
Of course, nothing is as simple as it might appear. While the on-demand 
provisioning capabilities of cloud services eliminates many time delays, an 
organization still needs to do its homework. These services aren’t free; needs 
and requirements must be determined before capability is automatically pro­
visioned.
Application programming 
interfaces (APIs)
Cloud services need to have standardized APIs. These interfaces provide the 
instructions on how two application or data sources can communicate with 
each other.
A standardized interface lets the customer more easily link a cloud ser­
vice, such as a customer relationship management system with a financial 
accounts management system, without having to resort to custom program­
ming. For more information on standards see Chapter 14. 
Billing and metering of services
Yes, there is no free lunch. A cloud environment needs a built-in service that 
bills customers. And, of course, to calculate that bill, usage has to be metered 
(tracked). Even free cloud services (such as Google’s Gmail or Zoho’s 
Internet-based office applications) are metered.
	
In addition to these characteristics, cloud computing must have two overarch­
ing requirements to be effective: 
	
✓	A comprehensive approach to service management 
	
✓	A well-defined process for security management

12
Part I: Introducing Cloud Computing 
Performance monitoring and measuring
A cloud service provider must include a service management environment. 
A service management environment is an integrated approach for managing 
your physical environments and IT systems. This environment must be able 
to maintain the required service level for that organization. 
In other words, service management has to monitor and optimize the service 
or sets of services. Service management has to consider key issues, such as 
performance of the overall system, including security and performance. For 
example, an organization using an internal or external email cloud service 
would require 99.999 percent uptime with maximum security. The organiza­
tion would expect the cloud provider to prove that it has met its obligations. 
Many cloud service providers give customers a dashboard — a visualization 
of key service metrics — so they can monitor the level of service they’re 
getting from their provider. Also, many customers use their own monitoring 
tools to determine whether their service level requirements are being met.
Security
Many customers must take a leap of faith to trust that the cloud service is 
safe. Turning over critical data or application infrastructure to a cloud-based 
service provider requires making sure that the information can’t be acciden­
tally accessed by another company (or maliciously accessed by a hacker). 
Many companies have compliance requirements for securing both inter­
nal and external information. Without the right level of security, you might 
not be able to use a provider’s offerings. For more details on security, see 
Chapter 15.
Comparing Cloud Providers with 
Traditional IT Service Providers
Traditional IT service providers operate the hardware, software, networks, 
and storage for its clients. While the customer pays the licensing fees for 
the software, the IT service provider manages the overall environment. The 
service provider operates the infrastructure in its own facilities. With the 
traditional IT service provider, the customer signs a long-term contract that 
specifies mutually agreed-upon service levels. These IT providers typically 
customize an environment to meet the needs of one customer.

13
 Chapter 1: Grasping the Fundamentals
In the cloud model, the service provider might still operate the infrastructure 
in its own facilities (except in the case of a private cloud, which we discuss 
in Chapter 9). However, the infrastructure might be virtualized across the 
globe, meaning that you may not know where your computing resources, 
applications, or even data actually reside. (We talk more about virtualization 
in Chapter 17.) Additionally, these service providers are designing their infra­
structure for scale, meaning that there isn’t necessarily a lot of customization 
going on. (We talk more about the scale issue in Chapter 13.)
Addressing Problems
There is an inherent conflict between what the business requires and what 
data center management can reasonably provide. Business management 
wants optimal performance, flawless implementation, and 100 percent 
uptime. The business leadership wants new capability to be available imme­
diately, frequent changes to applications, and more accessibility to quality 
data in real time — but their organizations have limited budgets.
Getting on board with cloud computing
Although opinions differ about how quickly 
technology will migrate to the cloud, without 
doubt the interest level is high. Lots of busi­
ness folks are asking questions about the 
cloud approach when they hear about the data 
center efficiencies achieved by companies like 
Amazon (www.amazon.com) and Google 
(www.google.com).
For example, a smart CEO was under a lot of 
pressure to improve profitability by cutting 
capital expenditures. One day he read an arti­
cle about the economic advantages of cloud 
computing in a business journal and began to 
wonder, “Hey, if Amazon can offer computing on 
demand, why can’t our own IT department act 
like that?” The CEO paid a visit to the CIO and 
asked that very question. The CIO wasn’t quite 
sure how to answer his boss. His only reply was 
that things are more complicated than that. The 
CIO pointed out issues related to data security 
and privacy. In addition, there are applications 
running in the data center that are one-of-a-kind 
and not easily handled. At the same time, he rec­
ognized that the department needed to provide 
better service to internal customers. The CIO did 
agree that there were other areas of IT that might 
be appropriate for the cloud model. For example, 
areas such as testing, software development, 
storage, and email were good candidates for 
cloud computing.

14
Part I: Introducing Cloud Computing 
	
Over time, it became easier for IT to add hardware to the data center rather 
than to focus on making the data center itself more effective. And this plan 
worked. By pouring more resources into the data center, IT ensured that criti­
cal applications wouldn’t run out of resources. At the same time, these compa­
nies built or bought software to meet business needs. The applications that 
were built internally were often large and complex. They had been modified 
repeatedly to satisfy changes without regard to their underlying architecture. 
Between managing a vast array of expanding hardware resources combined with 
managing huge and unwieldy business software, IT management found itself 
under extraordinary pressure to become much more effective and efficient.
This tug of war between the needs of the business and the data center con­
straints has caused friction over the past few decades. Clearly, need and 
money must be balanced. To meet these challenges, there have been sig­
nificant technology advancements including virtualization (see Chapter 17), 
service-oriented architecture (see Chapter 19), and service management (see 
Chapter 20). Each of these areas is intended to provide more modularity, flex­
ibility, and better performance for IT. 
While these technology enablers have helped companies to become more 
efficient and cost effective, it isn’t enough. Companies are still plagued with 
massive inefficiencies. The promise of the cloud is to enable companies to 
improve their ability to leverage what they’ve bought and make use of exter­
nal resources designed to be used on demand.
	
We don’t want to give you the idea that everything will be perfect when you 
get yourself a cloud. The world, unfortunately, is more complicated than 
that. For example, complex, brittle applications won’t all be successful if they 
are just thrown up on the cloud. Virtualization adds performance implica­
tions. And many of these applications lack an architecture to achieve scale. 
A database-bound application will remain database bound, regardless of the 
additional compute resources beneath it.
Discovering the Business Drivers 
for Consuming Cloud Services
In the beginning of this chapter, we name reasons companies are thinking 
about cloud services and some of the pressures coming from management. 
Clearly, business management is under a lot of pressure to reduce costs 
while providing a sophisticated level of service to internal and external cus­
tomers. In this section, we talk about the benefits of cloud services. 

15
 Chapter 1: Grasping the Fundamentals
Supporting business agility
One of the most immediate benefits of cloud-based infrastructure services 
is the ability to add new infrastructure capacity quickly and at lower costs. 
Therefore, cloud services allow the business to gain IT resources in a self-
service manager, thus saving time and money. By being able to move more 
quickly, the business can adapt to changes in the market without complex 
procurement processes. 
A typical cloud service provider has economies of scale (cost advantages 
resulting in the ability to spread fixed costs over more customers) that the 
typical corporation lacks. As mentioned earlier, the cloud’s self-service 
capability means it’s easier for IT to add more compute cycles (more CPU 
resources added on an incremental basis) or storage to meet an immediate 
or intermittent needs.
	
With the advent of the cloud, an organization can try out a new application or 
develop a new application without first investing in hardware, software, and 
networking.
Reducing capital expenditures
You might want to add a new business application, but lack the money. You 
might need to increase the amount of storage for various departments. Cloud 
service providers offer this type of capability at a prorated basis. A cloud ser­
vice vendor might rent storage on a per-gigabyte basis.
Companies are often challenged to increase the functionality of IT while 
minimizing capital expenditures. By purchasing just the right amount of IT 
resources on demand the organization can avoid purchasing unnecessary 
equipment. There are always trade-offs in any business situation. 
A company may significantly reduce expenses by moving to the cloud and 
then may find that its operating expenses increase more than predicted. In 
other situations, the company may already have purchased significant IT 
resources and it may be more economically efficient to use them to create 
a private cloud. Some companies actually view IT as their primary business 
and therefore will view IT as a revenue source. These companies will want to 
invest in their own resources to protect their business value.

Chapter 2
Discovering the Value of 
the Cloud for Business
In This Chapter
▶	Introducing a model of the cloud
▶	Getting familiar with as a service
▶	Measuring the cloud value to your business
A
s soon as you start reading about cloud computing, you run into the 
words as a service an awful lot. Examples include Infrastructure as a 
Service, hardware as a Service, social networks as a service, applications as a 
service, desktops as a service, and so on. 
The term service is a task that has been packaged so it can be automated 
and delivered to customers in a consistent and repeatable manner. These 
services may be delivered by a cloud service vendor or through your own 
internal data center. 
Modeling Services
We include the various types of cloud services into three distinct models, 
illustrated as different layers in Figure 2-1. The reality is that there is a blend­
ing between the types of service delivery models that are available from cloud 
vendors. For example, a Software as a Service vendor might decide to offer 
separate infrastructure services to customers. The purpose of grouping these 
services into three models is to aid in understanding what lies beneath a cloud 
service. All these service delivery models require management and administra­
tion (including security), as depicted by the outer ring in Figure 2-1.

18
Part I: Introducing Cloud Computing 
	
The three cloud service delivery models are Infrastructure as a Service, 
Platform as a Service, and Software as a Service, and the purpose of each 
model is as follows:
	
✓	The Infrastructure as a Service layer offers storage and compute 
resources that developers and IT organizations use to deliver custom 
business solutions.
	
✓	The Platform as a Service layer offers development environments that IT 
organizations can use to create cloud-ready business applications.
	
✓	The Software as a Service layer offers purpose-built business applications.
In this chapter we provide an introduction to each model. In addition, 
because an understanding of each model is critical to developing an under­
standing of cloud computing, each model is covered in separate chapters in 
Part II. 
The customer accesses those services with defined interfaces. These interfaces 
are, in fact, all that the user ever comes in contact with. The customer never sees 
the infrastructure that provides a movie on demand, for example — they only 
see the screen that enables the user to select and purchase the movie. Likewise, 
in cloud computing the underlying infrastructure that provides the service may 
be very sophisticated indeed. However, the user doesn’t necessarily need to 
understand this infrastructure to use it.

Understanding Infrastructure as a Service
	
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is the delivery of computer hardware (serv­
ers, networking technology, storage, and data center space) as a service. It 
may also include the delivery of operating systems and virtualization technol­
ogy to manage the resources.

19
 Chapter 2: Discovering the Value of the Cloud for Business
The IaaS customer rents computing resources instead of buying and install­
ing them in their own data center. The service is typically paid for on a usage 
basis. The service may include dynamic scaling so that if the customer winds 
up needing more resources than expected, he can get them immediately 
(probably up to a given limit). 
Dynamic scaling as applied to infrastructure means that the infrastructure 
can be automatically scaled up or down, based on the requirements of the 
application.
Additionally, the arrangement involves an agreed-upon service level. The ser­
vice level states what the provider has agreed to deliver in terms of availabil­
ity and response to demand. It might, for example, specify that the resources 
will be available 99.999 percent of the time and that more resources will be 
provided dynamically if greater than 80 percent of any given resource is 
being used.
	
Currently, the most high-profile IaaS operation is Amazon’s Elastic Compute 
Cloud (Amazon EC2). It provides a Web interface that allows customers to 
access virtual machines. EC2 offers scalability under the user’s control with 
the user paying for resources by the hour. The use of the term elastic in the 
naming of Amazon’s EC2 is significant. The elasticity refers to the ability that 
EC2 users have to easily increase or decrease the infrastructure resources 
assigned to meet their needs. The user needs to initiate a request, so this ser­
vice provided isn’t dynamically scalable. Users of EC2 can request the use of 
any operating system as long as the developer does all the work. Amazon itself 
supports a more limited number of operating systems (Linux, Solaris, and 
Windows). For an up-to-the-minute description of this service, go to http://
aws.amazon.com/ec2. 
Service delivery models defined
You have probably noticed a multitude of com­
panies providing all kinds of cloud services, 
using their own resources. Services you pur­
chase from these cloud service providers are 
offered to you the same way your TV cable 
provider offers services. Your cable contract 
provides you with access to watch a specific 
set of television channels. In addition to receiv­
ing your standard channels, you may have a 
self-service option where you can purchase a 
movie to watch on demand.

20
Part I: Introducing Cloud Computing 
	
Companies with research-intensive projects are a natural fit for IaaS. Cloud-
based computing services allow scientific and medical researchers to perform 
testing and analysis at levels that aren’t possible without additional access to 
computing infrastructure.
Other organizations with similar needs for additional computing resources 
may boost their own data centers by renting the computer hardware — 
appropriate allocations of servers, networking technology, storage, and data 
center space — as a service. Instead of laying out the capital expenditure for 
the maximum amount of resources to cover their highest level of demand, 
they purchase computing power when they need it.
Exploring Platform as a Service
With Platform as a Service (PaaS), the provider delivers more than infrastruc­
ture. It delivers what you might call a solution stack — an integrated set of soft­
ware that provides everything a developer needs to build an application — for 
both software development and runtime. 
PaaS can be viewed as an evolution of Web hosting. In recent years, Web-
hosting companies have provided fairly complete software stacks for devel­
oping Web sites. PaaS takes this idea a step farther by providing lifecycle 
management — capabilities to manage all software development stages from 
planning and design, to building and deployment, to testing and maintenance. 
The primary benefit of PaaS is having software development and deployment 
capability based entirely in the cloud — hence, no management or mainte­
nance efforts are required for the infrastructure. Every aspect of software 
development, from the design stage onward (including source-code manage­
ment, testing, and deployment) lives in the cloud. 
PaaS is inherently multi-tenant and naturally supports the whole set of Web 
services standards and is usually delivered with dynamic scaling. In refer­
ence to Platform as a Service, dynamic scaling means that the software can be 
automatically scaled up or down. Platform as a Service typically addresses 
the need to scale as well as the need to separate concerns of access and data 
security for its customers.
	
Although this approach has many benefits for customers, it also has some 
disadvantages. The major drawback of Platform as a Service is that it may 
lock you in to the use of a particular development environment and stack of 
software components. Platform as a Service offerings usually have some pro­
prietary elements (perhaps the development tools or even component librar­
ies). Consequently, you may be wedded to the vendor’s platform and unable 
to move your applications elsewhere without rewriting them to some degree. 
If you suddenly become dissatisfied with your Platform as a Service provider, 
you may face very high expenses when you suddenly need to rewrite the 
applications to satisfy the requirements of another PaaS vendor.

21
 Chapter 2: Discovering the Value of the Cloud for Business
	
The fear of vendor lock-in has led to a new variety of Platform as a Service 
emerging: Open Platform as a Service. This would offer the same approach as 
Platform as a Service, except that there is no constraint on choice of develop­
ment software. It avoids the possibility of lock-in.
Some examples of Platform as a Service include the Google App Engine, 
AppJet, Etelos, Qrimp, and Force.com, which is the official development envi­
ronment for Salesforce.com. See the “Salesforce.com and automation applica­
tion” sidebar elsewhere in this chapter for more on this pioneering example 
of Platform as a Service.
Seeing Software as a Service
One of the first implementations of cloud services was Software as a Service 
(SaaS) — business applications that are hosted by the provider and deliv­
ered as a service. 
	
SaaS has its roots in an early kind of hosting operation carried out by 
Application Service Providers (ASPs). The ASP business grew up soon after 
the Internet began to mushroom, with some companies offering to securely, 
privately host applications. Hosting of supply chain applications and cus­
tomer relationship management (CRM) applications was particularly promi­
nent, although some ASPs simply specialized in running email. Prior to the 
advent of this type of service, companies often spent huge amounts of money 
implementing and customizing these applications to satisfy internal business 
requirements. Many of these products weren’t only difficult to implement but 
hard to learn and use. However, the most successful vendors were those who 
recognized that an application delivered as a service with a monthly fee based 
on the number of users had to be easy to use and easy to stay with. 
CRM is one of the most common categories of Software as a Service; the most 
prominent vendor in this category is Salesforce.com, described in this chap­
ter’s sidebar. For a more extensive look at some of the other examples of 
Software as a Service, please refer to Chapter 12.
Buying Software as a Service offers a number of obvious advantages: While 
you can find a lot more information about these benefits in Chapter 12, the 
following provides some insight into why this approach to software delivery 
has gained so much traction with vendors and customers. The price of the 
software is on a per-use basis and involves no upfront costs from the ser­
vice provider. (Of course, the reality is that your company may have some 
upfront work to do to get your data loaded into the Software as a Service 
application database and you may have to deal with ongoing data integration 
between your internal and cloud data stores.) Businesses get the immediate 
benefit of reducing capital expenditures. In addition, a business gains the 
flexibility to test new software on a rental basis and then can continue to use 
and adopt the software, if it proves suitable.

22
Part I: Introducing Cloud Computing 
Software as a Service modes
As a holdover from the traditional ASP model, Software as a Service comes in 
two distinct modes:
	
✓	Simple multi-tenancy: Each customer has its own resources that are 
segregated from those of other customers. It amounts to a relatively 
inefficient form of multi-tenancy.
	
✓	Fine grain multi-tenancy: This offers the same level of segregation but from 
a software engineering perspective, it’s far more efficient. All resources are 
shared, but customer data and access capabilities are segregated within the 
application. This offers much superior economies of scale.
Salesforce.com and automation application
Salesforce.com built and delivered a sales force 
automation application (which automates sales 
functions such as tracking sales leads and pros­
pects and forecasting sales) that was suitable 
for the typical salesperson and built a business 
around making that application available over the 
Internet through a browser.
The company then expanded by encouraging 
the growth of a software ecosystem around its 
extended set of customer relationship manage­
ment (CRM) applications, prompting other compa­
nies to integrate their business applications with 
those of Salesforce.com (or build components to 
add to Salesforce.com). It began, for example, by 
allowing customers to change tabs and create 
their own database objects. Next, the company 
added what it called the AppExchange, which 
added published application programming inter­
faces (APIs) so that third-party software provid­
ers could integrate their applications into the 
Salesforce.com platform. 
Most AppExchange applications are more like 
utilities than full-fledged packaged apps. Many 
of the packages sold through the AppExchange 
are for tracking. For example, one tracks infor­
mation about commercial and residential prop­
erties; another optimizes the sales process for 
media/advertising companies; still another pack­
age analyzes sales data.
Salesforce.com took its offerings a step further 
by offering its own language called Apex. Apex is 
used only within the Salesforce.com platform and 
lets users build business applications and manage 
data and processes. A developer can use Apex 
to change the way the application looks. It is, in 
essence, the interface as a service.
With the advent of cloud computing, Salesforce.
com has packaged these offerings into what it 
calls Force.com, which provides a set of common 
services its partners and customers can use to 
integrate into their own applications. Salesforce.
com has thus started to also become a Platform 
as a Service vendor. Among the hundreds of 
applications that run on Force.com, it now offers a 
variety of HR software, and financial, supply chain, 
inventory, and risk management components. Just 
as Amazon is currently the trailblazer among the 
Infrastructure as a Service vendors, Salesforce.
com is the trailblazer among the Software as a 
Service vendors. However, many vendors are now 
providing Applications as a Service. It has become 
a popular option for selling software.

23
 Chapter 2: Discovering the Value of the Cloud for Business
	
Initially, Software as a Service offerings were not simply implemented over the 
Internet. For the sake of security and reliability, these offerings would nor­
mally involve the use of virtual private networks (VPNs). A VPN essentially 
makes the public network your own private network (by using some form of 
encryption) instead of having to purchase dedicated connectivity. This 
enables you to securely transmit data over a public network like the Internet. 
Massively scaled Software as a Service
All as-a-service businesses are based on the service provider offering the ser­
vice at a much lower cost than you providing it for yourself. If the price differ­
ence is large enough, assuming no other complications, it’s a win-win — the 
provider grows a thriving business and the customers pay less to run their 
applications.
	
But some applications can be run really inexpensively in the cloud. When you 
have millions of users doing exactly the same thing — and we mean exactly the 
same thing (not similar things) — you can keep the cost per user very, very 
low. Enter massively scaled Software as a Service. One example is Yahoo Mail. 
Yahoo is the largest email provider, with approximately 260 million users.
This is possible because the provider can optimize all data center compo­
nents including the hardware, communications, and software to support just 
one or two types of workloads. 
	
Environments such as Facebook, eBay, Skype, Google Apps, and others are all 
designed for massive scaling. You may not think of many of these Web sites as 
being software applications at all. Nevertheless, all are used directly by busi­
nesses, for business purposes. For example, some companies use the social 
networking site Facebook as a free intranet for its employees. Online auction­
eer eBay is the basis of more than 500,000 small businesses, Skype (free online 
calls and video) is used by small businesses the world over, and Google Apps 
(messaging and collaboration tools) has over a million different businesses 
enrolled. For more about this topic, take a look at Chapter 13. 
Economies of scale
The companies that provide massively scaled Software as a Service achieve 
dramatic economies of scale — cost efficiencies gained from reducing per-unit 
costs when more of the same item is produced or more of the same work­
loads are processed. 

24
Part I: Introducing Cloud Computing 
It’s worth listing all the reasons why:
	
✓	The standardized workloads can be executed on a highly integrated, 
massively replicable infrastructure stack. They don’t have to support a 
wide array of workloads and a heterogeneous stack of hardware, middle­
ware, OS, and so on.
	
✓	The computer hardware and network is highly streamlined and can be 
bought in bulk and configured to allow expansion. Often these com­
panies require that hardware be engineered for their unique scaling 
requirements.
	
✓	All software can be stripped down so that only what is necessary is 
loaded.
	
✓	The service/software itself is written from scratch in a cloud-optimized 
way, tailored for efficiency at an instruction level.
	
✓	The provider may not offer or guarantee a specific service level.
	
✓	There is no need for virtualization technology to build virtual machines. 
The software can be engineered to the bare metal.
	
✓	The profile of the workload is measurable and predictable simply by 
numbers of users.
Management and Administration
If you refer to Figure 2-1, you will notice that the three layers are surrounded 
with an area called Management and Administration. This is where life in the 
cloud can get very complicated. It’s simple enough to describe how to use 
some kind of cloud computing service, but you also have to integrate it into 
the IT operations of the organization, and that isn’t necessarily a simple thing 
to do. 
For example, because a cloud requires a self-service capability, it must be 
designed to manage not just provisioning customer requests but also issues 
such as workload management, security, metering, monitoring, and billing 
services. We provide much more detail on this topic in Chapters 21 and 22.
Many managers understand that for cloud services to be safe and effective, 
they must measure and monitor performance.
In fact, performance monitoring will become increasingly important as com­
panies rely more on third-party services. And, from all indications, a typical 
company may use more than one cloud services provider. For example, a 

25
 Chapter 2: Discovering the Value of the Cloud for Business
company may use one cloud provider for a platform such as collaboration 
and a completely different provider for compute services. They may use 
another provider for storage. 
	
✓	How well does each cloud service perform? 
	
✓	How are they performing together to support the business? 
	
✓	Are the cloud services vendors adhering to governance rules that the 
company is required to follow? 
Refer to Chapter 17 for more information on governance in the cloud.
	
Don’t take a supplier’s word that everything is working well. Although your 
company can save money in the data centers and on software licenses, you 
need to spend money and resources on service management to protect your 
business assets.

A
t first glance, you might think that the cloud is a totally self-service 
environment. The reality is more complicated than that. The cloud, 
like every other computing platform, has to be managed. In this chapter, 
we discuss the overall cloud environment and the issues you need to con­
sider, from organizational and administrative challenges to managing cloud 
resources.
Feeling Sensational about Organization 
	
Cloud services impact your organization in subtle ways. The cloud impacts 
the whole company, not just the IT department: 
	
✓	How do cloud services fit into your overall corporate and IT strategy? 
How will you manage cloud service providers along with your internal 
services? How will you make sure that your customers are well sup­
ported by services that are moving to a cloud? 
	
✓	Does the cloud support your corporate and IT governance requirements? 
	
✓	What are the important issues of emerging corporate and governmental 
standards, business process management, and the overall issues of man­
aging costs?

28
Part I: Introducing Cloud Computing 
Deciding on a strategy
Like any other technology strategy, a cloud strategy is considered in relation­
ship to the following:
	
✓	Your IT organization’s overall strategy
	
✓	Your company’s overall strategy
You must make a complex evaluation of costs, benefits, business cultural 
issues, risks, and corporate and government standards before developing a 
comprehensive cloud strategy. Although very few organizations have tested 
cloud services in these heavy usage situations, a well-planned cloud service 
strategy has the potential to significantly reduce costs. Chapter 4 talks you 
through that strategizing.
	
Over time, however, as more well-tested commercial cloud services become 
available, companies will increasingly be able to rely on these services not just 
for IT cost savings, but also for delivering new value to the organization. The 
trend toward well-managed cloud services is especially important because of 
the increased automation across the organization. This may include the soft­
ware embedded in everything from manufacturing systems to radio frequency 
identification tags that track inventory. 
	
Cloud services can help organizations in steps. With utility computing, any cus­
tomer can plug in an application or component because all the interfaces have 
been standardized between implementations. For companies to successfully 
use the cloud, management must decide what types of services they will begin 
deploying from the cloud. 
One organization may decide that a Software as a Service approach is best, 
whereas another wants incremental capacity on demand. Before planning 
a usage strategy, consider what cloud services might be right for you. Most 
organizations adopt a hybrid strategy, combining internal managed services 
with cloud-based services. Chapter 9 details hybrid clouds. 
Coping with governance issues
	
Four distinct cloud categories exist (and they’re discussed at length in 
Chapter 2). Each approach presents different governance challenges: 
	
✓	Infrastructure as a Service
	
✓	Platform as a Service
	
✓	Software as a Service 
	
✓	Business Process as a Service

29
 Chapter 3: Getting Inside the Cloud
To make matters more complicated, these approaches have no clean divid­
ing line. Emerging vendors often combine approaches into their offerings. In 
addition, in most instances, a hybrid situation develops where on-premise 
applications are used in collaboration with traditionally hosted services and 
cloud services.
Governing internally provided services and the externally provided cloud-
based services introduces new challenges for a company’s strategy: 
	
✓	How do you manage the overall lifecycle of your IT resources, including 
software licensing, cost allocation, and charge backs? 
	
✓	How to you protect the integrity of your information resources? How do 
you ensure that you’re complying with data privacy rules and regulations?
	
✓	How do you make sure that all your service providers can prove and doc­
ument that they’re meeting governmental and corporate requirements?
IT governance issues are complicated by new suppliers and new capabilities. 
With governance, your company needs to prove that it’s complying with rules 
set by both governmental agencies and the corporation. Ideally, service pro­
viders of all types will deliver the same levels of control that you would have 
with your own resources. However, when you don’t control how that new sup­
plier operates, governance gets more complicated. Cloud computing requires a 
higher level of oversight to ensure that governance standards are met.
Monitoring business processes
Most cloud services impact the way business processes are implemented 
within an organization. For example, your organization may be using a cloud-
based service to check credit worthiness for potential customers. Therefore, 
you have to make sure that these services are linked back to your internal 
systems so things don’t fall through the cracks. 
	
Your business should standardize a way to monitor business processes that 
live entirely or partially in a cloud environment. An organization’s important 
computer-dependent business processes need to be constantly monitored by 
software. Linking internal and external processes together in a seamless way 
is the best way to ensure customer satisfaction.
Many organizations already use third-party business process providers for 
things such as payment services. The importance of third-party providers 
continues to expand as more services are made available in the cloud — 
these services will be linked with a variety of internal and external provid­
ers. Software components of such business processes may migrate into the 
cloud, as long as this migration doesn’t impede their monitoring. For that 
reason, you need to examine all cloud propositions to see if they impact busi­
ness process monitoring.

30
Part I: Introducing Cloud Computing 
Managing IT costs
All IT departments monitor costs, but few monitor them in terms of asset 
performance — the requirement to optimize the return on investments for 
both hardware and software. This is likely to change with the onset of cloud 
services. Unlike traditional licensing models, cloud propositions are based on 
rental arrangements. 
You must compare two cost models:
	
✓	Operating expenses (paying per month, per user for each service)
	
✓	Capital investments (paying a purchase fee plus yearly maintenance for 
software that resides within your organization)
	
Evaluating the differences between the two cost models is a complex proce­
dure for many companies. In some situations, the new cost models shift some 
responsibility away from IT to the business unit. For example, if a company’s 
business unit hires 20 new employees and email is managed in the cloud, the 
business unit needs to budget for 20 more users. IT doesn’t have to ensure 
that server capacity and IT staff are sufficient to support the additional users; 
that’s now the responsibility of the cloud services provider. However, IT 
departments need to carefully monitor the effectiveness of the cloud environ­
ment to support the enterprise.
Administering Cloud Services
A company has to ask itself many questions:
	
✓	Are the cloud services doing what we want them to do? 
	
✓	How do we know if the performance is at the right level? 
	
✓	How can we judge whether the data that was deleted is really gone? 
Solving these problems isn’t easy. Investigating the reliability and viability of 
a cloud provider is one of the most complex areas faced when managing the 
cloud. The advent of cloud computing will be accompanied by disappointed 
customers and lawsuits for sure — some as a consequence of unrealistic 
expectations and some as a consequence of poor service. 
	
It’s particularly important for IT departments to enable administration sys­
tems that let them monitor every dimension of the service they’re getting.

31
 Chapter 3: Getting Inside the Cloud
	
In theory, the cloud service provider can build and provide a very stable 
service that is less expensive than a customer can implement internally. 
However, there can be a serious gap between the actual service and the 
promises made in the provider’s sales literature.
You have to do your homework when evaluating the providers. Evaluate their 
experience in the market, the type of partnerships they’ve established, and 
their reputation in the market. You can also talk to other customers that have 
used their services. 
Here are some of the issues to consider:
	
✓	What vendors are available to solve your problem? 
	
✓	How effective are the providers in managing their own environment? 
	
✓	Do they provide repeatable services? 
	
✓	How do these vendors handle an outage? 
	
✓	What’s their experience in dealing with customer issues? 
	
In addition to finding a good partner, it’s always a good idea to have more 
than one provider as an alternative.
Service level agreements and monitoring
Every company that buys any service from a cloud service provider must 
either accept a standard service level agreement (SLA) from the provider or 
negotiate such an agreement. A service level agreement is a contract that stip­
ulates the type of service you need from providers and what type of penalties 
would result from an unexpected business interruption. 
	
No organization should commit mission-critical systems to the cloud with­
out negotiating an SLA that includes significant penalties for not delivering 
the promised service level. Management needs to know what service level is 
appropriate under changing business conditions. Management can’t assume 
that the service provider will provide all the monitoring. Rather, the adminis­
trators must have their own ability to monitor service to satisfy the company’s 
goals for performance.

32
Part I: Introducing Cloud Computing 
Support
Support problems don’t disappear when applications or infrastructures move 
to the cloud. You have to make sure that support targets are agreed on in 
advance with a cloud services provider. Therefore, your company must align 
its internal support team that deals with internal customers with the cloud 
provider. 
What processes are in place to resolve problems when they arise? Just con­
sider the situation where some important application has a performance 
problem. Especially in a hybrid environment, it’s not always easy to tell if a 
problem resides within the cloud or outside of it. Such situations need to be 
prevented or at least dealt with very efficiently.
Billing and accounting
One cloud benefit is that, as a customer you can acquire just as much capa­
bility as needed. For this to work, billing and account management must be 
automated. Customers, therefore, need to be able to monitor what they’re 
using and how much it costs.
	
Potential problems arise if service level penalties aren’t clear and if the pro­
vider adds too many incidental charges. Customers can run up unexpected 
bills if they can’t accurately track usage.
Looking at the Technical Interface
Because the cloud service market is so new, few applications have been built 
from the ground up for this new environment. So far, no corporate applica­
tions were built with this model in mind. 
	
Organizations that already have well-designed interfaces between application 
and infrastructure components may find it easier to transition to the cloud. 
Companies that have moved to a service-oriented architecture (SOA) are well 
positioned to make the move. Chapter 19 talks about SOA in detail.
With SOA, organizations build modular business services that include stan­
dardized interfaces. This modular approach is needed when approaching the 
highly distributed cloud environment. SOA is a good start; however, a lot of 
standardized interfaces will need to be developed for cloud service platforms 
in the coming years. (For more on the topic of service-oriented architecture, 
see Service Oriented Architecture For Dummies, Second Edition, by Judith 
Hurwitz, Robin Bloor, Marcia Kaufman, and Fern Halper.)

33
 Chapter 3: Getting Inside the Cloud
APIs and data transformations
	
A cloud’s Application Programming Interface (API) is the software interface that 
lets your company’s infrastructure or applications plug in to the cloud. This is 
perhaps the most important place for standardization. 
Many vendors in the cloud space would like to claim overall leadership and 
control over the interfaces. Therefore, many different vendors are develop­
ing their own interfaces. This, in turn, means that customers are likely to be 
forced to support multiple APIs. Managing multiple APIs means that when 
applications are changed, there’s more programming involved; and there’s 
more potential for errors when too many APIs are supported. 
Even if vendors agree to a set of API standards, there will be data transforma­
tion issues (as data moves from one physical machine to another). These 
data transformations are the same as those required in projects such as 
building a data warehouse, with just one minor difference: The built-in soft­
ware platform and Software as a Service environments must follow the data 
standards of the particular cloud service provider. For an organization to 
easily build connections between its internal data center and the cloud, it 
must use standardized APIs and data transformation capabilities.
Data and application architecture
New internally created services that support the changing business’s chang­
ing demands must operate with cloud ecosystems. These services may need 
to migrate to and from the cloud. For example, a company might initiate a 
partnership that requires development and deployment in the cloud. This 
means that it will have to build an architecture that’s modular enough to 
allow services to move between various cloud platforms.
	
The consistency and flexibility of an SOA approach makes it a good fit for the 
cloud. In an SOA environment, software components are put into services or 
containers. These containers hold software that executes a specific task. After 
software exists within a container, it can be ported from one environment to 
another, which makes it easier to port into and out of the cloud. 
To be effective in a cloud environment, data also has to be packaged and 
managed. This isn’t simple, but it’s instrumental in making the cloud an 
effective business platform. The IT organization needs to manage data inde­
pendently of the underlying packaged application, transactional system, or 
data environment such as a warehouse. Important data needs to easily move 
between internal data centers and external cloud-based environments. Your 
organization needs to start with consistent definitions of data elements to 
manage cloud-based information services.

34
Part I: Introducing Cloud Computing 
Security in the cloud
Companies planning to use cloud services must be assured of tight, well-
defined security services. Chapter 15 details security.
Many levels of security are required within a cloud environment:
	
✓	Identity management: For example, so that any application service or 
even hardware component can be authorized on a personal or group 
role basis.
	
✓	Access control: There also needs to be the right level of access control 
within the cloud environment to protect the security of resources. 
	
✓	Authorization and authentication: There must be a mechanism so the 
right people can change applications and data.	
	
A comprehensive security infrastructure must be provided at all levels and 
types of cloud services. Developers also need tools that allow them to secure 
the services they design to be delivered in the cloud. Organizations need con­
sistent security across their own data center environments that intersect with 
a cloud service.
Managing Cloud Resources
In theory, cloud-services–based resources should be no different from the 
resources in your own environment, except that they live remotely. Ideally, 
you have a complete view of the resources you use today or may want to use 
in the future. Although this sounds straightforward, achieving it isn’t that 
easy. 
In most cloud environments, the customer is able to access only the services 
they’re entitled to use. Entire applications may be used on a cloud services 
basis. Development tools are sometimes cloud based. In fact, testing and 
monitoring environments can be based on the cloud. 
	
How should you, the cloud customer, approach managing cloud resources? 
Three aspects of cloud resource management apply: 
	
✓	IT security
	
✓	Performance management 
	
✓	Provisioning

35
 Chapter 3: Getting Inside the Cloud
IT security
IT security is a major concern for new adopters of cloud computing. Ideally, 
you want the IT security in the cloud to integrate seamlessly with the IT secu­
rity in your own data center. 
However, the cloud service provider implements its own IT security procedures
	
✓	To protect customers from external threats 
	
✓	To ensure that individual customer environments are isolated from one 
another
For every type of cloud service, the provider delivers a good deal of the IT 
security. You may need to understand how the cloud provider handles issues 
such as patch management and configuration management as the provider 
upgrades to new tools and new operating systems.
	
As the customer, you should 
	
✓	Understand the IT security software and hardware (firewalls, intrusion 
detection systems, virtual private networks [VPNs], and secure connec­
tions) that the cloud provider has in place. 
	
✓	Know how the cloud providers are protecting the overall computing 
environment. 
	
In the case of Infrastructure as a Service and Platform as a Service, cloud pro­
viders need to clarify the kind of IT security it expects the customer to put in 
place on its own behalf. With Software as a Service, the provider is responsi­
ble for all security except for access security — either an identity management 
system or at least a local access control application — through the customer’s 
own systems.
Performance management
Performance management is all about how your software services run effec­
tively inside your own environment and through the cloud. 
	
If you start to connect software that runs in your own data center directly to 
software that runs in the cloud, you create a potential bottleneck at the point 
of connection.

36
Part I: Introducing Cloud Computing 
	
When you move applications or services into the cloud, you change the basic 
data center network topology and some application configurations (and possi­
bly some interfaces). This means that performance needs to be considered 
and designed in at the start for every type of cloud service: Infrastructure as a 
Service, Platform as a Service, and Software as a Service.
	
Services connected between the cloud and your computing environment can 
impact performance if they aren’t well planned. This is especially likely to be 
the case if there are data translations or specific protocols to adhere to at the 
cloud gateway. 
As a customer, your ability to directly control the resources will be much 
lower in the cloud. Therefore, 
	
✓	The connection points between various services must be monitored in 
real time. A breakdown may impact your ability to provide a business 
process to your customers.
	
✓	There must be expanded bandwidth at connection points. 
	
From the performance perspective, the situation is likely to be much less frag­
ile if systems don’t straddle the data center and the cloud. 
In reality, many companies combine services in the cloud and services within 
their own data center. Therefore, monitoring across these environments pre­
vents many problems. 
Provisioning
With Software as a Service, a customer expects provisioning (to request a 
resource for immediate use) of extra services s to be immediate, automatic, 
and effortless. The cloud service provider is responsible for maintaining an 
agreed-on level of service and provisions resources accordingly. 
	
The situation is similar with Platform as a Service or Infrastructure as a 
Service, but you may need to directly request additional resources — because 
in both cases you’re directly managing the cloud resources instead of having 
them managed on your behalf.
The normal situation in a data center is that software workloads vary 
throughout the day, week, month, and year. So the data center has to be built 
for the maximum possible workload, with a little bit of extra capacity thrown 
in to cover unexpectedly high peaks. One of the immediate attractions of 
Infrastructure as a Service is that a data center could move its volatile work­
loads into the cloud and pay for additional resources on demand. In other 
words, hardware use in the data center is much more efficient.

37
 Chapter 3: Getting Inside the Cloud
Service management
Service management in this context covers all the data center operations 
activities. This broad discipline considers the necessary techniques and 
tools for managing services by both cloud providers and the internal data 
center managers across these environments:
	
✓	Physical
	
✓	IT 
	
✓	Virtual
Service management encompasses many different disciplines, including 
	
✓	Configuration management
	
✓	Asset management
	
✓	Network management
	
✓	Capacity planning
	
✓	Service desk
	
✓	Root cause analysis
	
✓	Workload management
	
✓	Patch and update management
The reality is that the cloud itself is a service management platform. 
Therefore, well-designed cloud service portfolios include a tight integration 
of the core service management capabilities and well-defined interfaces.
Untangling Software Dependencies
Perhaps the biggest problem that organizations face when they consider 
moving applications systems or whole collections of systems into the cloud 
is the issue of software dependencies. This is important because the cloud 
uses a service-oriented architecture approach where these services are 
loosely coupled (loosely linked) together. How do you deal with the depen­
dencies between services? See Chapter 19 for more on loose coupling and 
service orientation. 
In theory, all the applications running your data center share infrastructure 
and data. However, as companies begin migrating applications or capabili­
ties (such as data or storage) into the cloud, these applications need to be 
designed to support technical independence.

38
Part I: Introducing Cloud Computing 
Therefore, before any part of the data center moves to the cloud, it needs to 
be separated from dependencies that already exist. For a gradual move into 
the cloud, the full inventory of applications and systems needs to be consid­
ered in terms of which ones must — or at least should — move together. The 
interdependencies determine this, whatever their perspective:
	
✓	Hardware perspective (for example, a specific clustering of processors 
is required)
	
✓	Platform perspective (say, the provider must use a given OS and a given 
middleware product)
	
✓	Software perspective (maybe the specific services need to be closely 
coupled with related applications) 
	
✓	From any mixture of these
	
Removing the dependencies among various applications and systems helps 
an organization evolve the data center into a more flexible, modular environ­
ment. Establishing this architectural approach, in effect, creates containers of 
functionality within the data center that ease the transition to the cloud.

M
any companies think that the cloud has the potential to dramatically 
reduce the costs of managing their technology infrastructure. The 
situation isn’t black and white. In some situations, cloud-based services are 
the right solution at the right time at the right price. In other circumstances, 
the cloud as a platform needs more investigation before applying it to a busi­
ness problem. It is tempting to simply start using a variety of cloud services 
in response to an immediate problem. However, before you get too far down 
the road, you need to make sure that you have a strategy and road map for 
how and when you are going to use cloud services within your organization.
You need a strategy. Here, we list five key areas that should be part of your 
planning: 
	
✓	When and how should you use a public, private, and hybrid cloud service?
	
✓	What is your company’s strategy for managing capital and operational 
expenses over time?
	
✓	How do you plan to achieve the right level of service across the cloud 
and the data center?
	
✓	What are the rules and regulations that your cloud provider needs to 
adhere to, to keep your company safe and in compliance?
	
✓	How are you planning to control the data as it moves out of your data 
center into external clouds?

40
Part I: Introducing Cloud Computing 
	
There is no one right path or strategy to leveraging cloud services within your 
business. The decision depends on your data center, your applications, your 
service portfolio, and your changing business requirements. 
Seeing the Many Aspects 
of Your Cloud Strategy
You have to think about several issues before sending your organization into 
the cloud. There isn’t just one approach. You might choose one or more of 
these approaches at different times for different reasons. 
Consider a few simple examples:
	
✓	Your company is building a new application that will change the 
way you sell products online. You want to stress test this new appli­
cation before releasing it to customers. Although you have a few 
extra resources inside your firewall, they aren’t extensive enough to 
demonstrate if the new application will really scale. Using a cloud 
Infrastructure as a Service enables you to test the application effectively.
	
✓	Your company has run its own email internally for more than 20 
years. It takes up a lot of space in the data center and requires a staff 
of ten people. Money is tight and the CIO must cut staff and capital 
expenses. The CIO finds a Software as a Service platform that can run 
the corporate email for a fraction of the cost of running email internally. 
Your company makes the move and the savings are dramatic.
	
✓	Your company is building a new but highly experimental application 
that might transform its business model. It might not be worth spend­
ing a lot of money on software and hardware upfront. In fact, if the proj­
ect succeeds, the new application may be deployed in the cloud (and 
not within your company’s own data center). Therefore, the company 
uses a Platform as a Service (PaaS) that includes its own well-designed 
and fully vetted development environment, new generation tools, and 
interfaces that allow it to connect to many different environments. No 
need to pretest all the components provided by the PaaS vendor — 
they’re well designed and have been tested. The new application built 
on this platform is completed in record time and deployed to a test 
group of customers directly from the cloud service.
	
✓	Your company has started using a third-party SaaS solution for its 
customer-management application. It has successfully replaced the on-
premise customer-relationship management package that you’ve been 
running in the data center for years. Now your company wonders what 
else could be moved out of the data center into the cloud. How about 
the mainframe transaction processing system that handles all orders 
worth more than $1 million? After some investigation, you realize that 

41
 Chapter 4: Developing Your Cloud Strategy
because the system is only used by a few individuals in the company 
and the information needs to be carefully governed, the cloud isn’t a 
good choice.
	
✓	Your CIO has seen some new software that could solve a serious 
problem, but you aren’t convinced that the solution is right. Instead of 
buying a license, your company decides to use it as a service. After six 
months, it proves valuable. The software company offers you the oppor­
tunity to use the Software as a Service or on premise.
As you can see, planning your cloud strategy has many different dimensions — 
maybe more than what you might have thought about in the past. You need a 
road map to think about how a cloud strategy can be used to support your com­
pany’s business goals. 
Questioning Your Company’s Strategy
Deciding to investigate cloud computing is primarily a business decision. 
Therefore, start by evaluating these things:
	
✓	Your company’s business strategy 
	
✓	The role that your technology infrastructure plays in that strategy
	
Ask these questions: 
	
✓	What type of business am I in? 
	
✓	Is my industry highly regulated? 
	
✓	How do I benefit my customers? 
	
✓	How much value am I getting from my existing data center operations? 
	
✓	What are my company’s short-term and long-term goals? 
	
✓	Am I under pressure to reduce capital expenses? 
	
✓	Am I planning to develop new, untested technology-based offerings over 
the next 18–24 months? 
	
✓	Am I looking to acquire complementary companies? 
	
✓	How are my competitors dealing with their technology strategy? 
	
✓	Are my competitors able to move more quickly than my company? 
	
✓	What are my strategic advantages?
After you understand the company strategy, you can develop your own stra­
tegic plan. 

42
Part I: Introducing Cloud Computing 
Assessing Where You Are Today
The blessing and the curse of cloud computing is that it is actually quite 
easy to get started. In many cases, you start with the cloud as a technical 
approach first and then move to a strategic approach over time. One of 
the benefits of cloud computing is that for very low cost you can try out a 
service, find out how it works, and how it might benefit your company. You 
simply sign yourself up for a service. 
And that might be a fine starting point. However, make sure that you’re think­
ing strategically, not just about one or a series of cloud services; investigate 
how these services fit into your overall computing strategy. You need to ask 
yourself the following questions.
How tangled is my computing 
environment?
Whether you’re a small or large company, you probably have a lot of appli­
cations. Some applications may have been developed internally, whereas 
others may be packaged software. What makes a computing environment 
complicated? There could be hundreds of these applications with thousands 
of dependencies that are difficult to untangle. For example, your company 
might have a single mortgage-management system that depends on ten other 
accounting and customer-management systems. Your company might rely 
on external services from a third party (a provider of payment services, for 
example). Indeed, most data centers have evolved over time into a complex, 
tangled web of applications, servers, and networks.
What’s my data center environment?
When you consider peeling off some applications and moving them to the 
cloud, think about the impact on your overall business. Many computing 
environments aren’t set up as a series of well-defined services. 
Analyze your computing environment’s current state. This type of analysis 
gives you clues to possible cost savings. Instead of moving applications 
directly to the cloud, you might actually have to start by simplifying your 
internal computing environment. 

43
 Chapter 4: Developing Your Cloud Strategy
Take a hard look at your data center: 
	
✓	Is the architecture consistent or does each application have its own 
architecture? 
	
✓	Are there common business services used by multiple applications? 
	
✓	Are these common business services self-contained (or do they depend 
on other applications and services in your environment)? 
	
✓	Has your organization implemented workload management? 
	
The more service enabled your computing environment becomes, the better 
prepared your organization will be to take advantage of various cloud ser­
vices. It’s much harder to move components into the cloud if you can’t sepa­
rate applications or business services from your data center services. 
What data supports my strategy? 
Consider the information running in your data center. Before moving any 
data into the cloud, you need to think about 
	
✓	Privacy and compliance issues
	
✓	Security issues
	
✓	Data management issues specific to your company
For example, if you’re a financial services organization that moves your email 
into the cloud, email must be archived. After archiving the email, it must be 
easily accessible to meet regulatory considerations. Another example: A mul­
tinational company, before moving data into the cloud for marketing analysis, 
checks the laws regarding data access by different governments, cross-coun­
try data flow, and so on. 
	
Data management and security are so important that we devote two separate 
chapters to each topic: See Chapters 8 and 15. In fact, your data may require 
reevaluation of a public cloud model to a private or hybrid model. Chapter 9 
details private and hybrid clouds.
	
It might seem a lot of work to go through the exercise of understanding your 
current environment. It’s crucial to helping you pick the right cloud strategy 
for your organization. 
	
✓	You may think the best starting point is to implement Infrastructure as a 
Service to add incremental storage capacity to support a new business 
initiative. 

44
Part I: Introducing Cloud Computing 
	
✓	You might decide to use Platform as a Service to limit the capital 
expenses needed to develop a new application. 
	
✓	Another starting point might be to add Software as a Service to analyze 
what the market is saying about your products and any possible acquisi­
tion targets. 
	
✓	Some organizations might have the need for a Business Process as a 
Service (such as a supply chain service on demand) that could support 
testing a new line of business.
Assessing Your Expense Structure 
	
One of the most important tasks when preparing for the cloud: Assessing your 
cost structure (for example, how much you’re spending on supporting existing 
hardware, software, networking services). How can you determine the cost 
savings if you don’t know what you’re spending today? Also take potential 
future costs into account.
Things may get fuzzy. You may sometimes want to use business services 
offered by cloud application vendors. You may want to build some internal 
service oriented architecture-based services that can live inside a cloud envi­
ronment. In some situations, it may save money to move a service such as 
email, software testing, or storage to a cloud, because the costs of perform­
ing the service internally are so much higher. In other situations, the costs 
for implementing a key application in the cloud may be much more expensive 
than running it internally. 
Chapter 21 explains more about cloud economics.
Checking Up on Rules and Governances
	
We recommend assessing your current IT and business governance situation 
as you develop your cloud strategy. In some cases, governance and compli­
ance prohibit certain types of information from leaving the organization’s 
internal environment. How good is your internal security today? If you’re con­
sidering a cloud service provider, you need to be confident that the company 
can support your security and governance needs with oversight and account­
ability. Examine the reports and documentation to support your oversight 
requirements. Talk to the provider’s other customers to see how well it meets 
its customers governance requirements.

45
 Chapter 4: Developing Your Cloud Strategy
For example, you may want to leverage a third-party credit checking service 
from the cloud. How well constructed is it? Does it conform to your com­
pany’s business rules? 
	
Aside from security and privacy issues, you have a number of legal issues to 
consider as well. For example, what happens to your application and data if 
the cloud provider goes out of business? Who’s liable for lost information? 
Does the provider guarantee uptime? What recourse do you have if the service 
level agreement isn’t met?
Chapter 16 details governance issues.
Developing a Road Map
You must consider many things before developing a road map:
	
✓	The efficiency and effectiveness of your current data center 
	
✓	Costs 
	
✓	Risks 
	
✓	Your organizational readiness 
After you understand the issues and gaps, you can start designing your cloud 
plan — the road map that outlines the following:
	
✓	What are the services that you need to support your business growth?
	
✓	How you will roll them out?
	
✓	When you will roll them out (or in, as it were)?
	
Don’t try to do everything at once with your cloud strategy. It probably makes 
sense to roll out these services gradually so you can see the benefits and get 
buy-in throughout your organization. Plus, starting cloud services step by step 
can help you react quickly to business needs.
	
Even if you figure out all the technical requirements for leveraging the cloud as 
part of your strategy, you still have to plan to communicate the action plan to 
the business and the IT communities. Some people might consider the cloud a 
threat because it will remove some tasks from the IT department. Business man­
agement will want to know that they have control over important business data. 
For more details on your strategy action plan see Chapter 22. 

46
Part I: Introducing Cloud Computing 
	
You need to understand how your vendors track performance and security. 
Don’t simply take their word for it and assume that everything is perfectly 
fine. Even if the cloud vendor provides you with a slick dashboard, you should 
have your own means of monitoring your content. You’re turning over some 
key responsibility to a cloud provider, but the buck still stops with your orga­
nization. Plan carefully for controlling your assets in the cloud. Chapter 20 
talks more about management from a cloud customer perspective. 

Part II
Understanding the 
Nature of the 
Cloud

In this part . . .
W
hat’s inside the cloud? In this part, we examine a 
highly scaled computing environment. Because 
that environment is front and center, we look at the tech­
nical foundation for this model, including workloads and 
data services.

Chapter 5
Seeing the Advantages of the 
Highly Scaled Data Center 
In This Chapter
▶	Modeling a data center
▶	Location, location, location
▶	Powering things up

A
s we discuss in Chapter 1, many company managers are demanding 
that IT management transform their data centers into platforms that 
can scale easily and effectively. Other managers are looking at the cloud plat­
form as a way to eliminate the high costs of running traditional data centers. 
If you’re tasked with planning your cloud strategy, how do you do what’s 
best for your organization? At first glance, it might seem obvious: Simply find 
a cloud services provider, analyze how much it charges for the services you 
need, and compare it to the costs of your own data center. It isn’t that simple. 
	
✓	It’s unlikely that everything you do in your data center will be available 
as a cloud service. 
	
✓	Even if it is, it might not meet your specific needs. 
Ultimately, cloud services are attractive because the cost is likely to be far 
lower than providing the same service from your traditional data center, so 
we think it will help if you understand why cloud data center costs are lower. 
This economic factor applies to clouds whether they’re private or public.

50
Part II: Understanding the Nature of the Cloud 
In fact, the cloud data center has two aspects: 
	
✓	The costs of things that don’t depend directly on technology 
	
✓	The costs of things that do
In this chapter, we take an in-depth look at the things that don’t depend 
on technology and explain why the cloud data center has a significant cost 
advantage.
Comparing Financial Damage: 
Traditional versus Cloud 
How much does a data center cost to run? It depends on these things: 
	
✓	How big it is. How many virtual servers? Is the data center massive? 
How much square footage; how many servers? Does it cost $5 million a 
year to run?
	
✓	Where it is. How much does office space cost. What about cost of staff? 
Is the data center close to inexpensive power sources?
	
✓	What it’s doing. Does the data center protect sensitive data? What is its 
kind of business? What level of compliance must it adhere to?
Clearly, you have many ways to look at the situation. 
Traditional data center
Although each data center is a little different, the average cost per year to 
operate a large data center is usually between $10 million to $25 million. 
Stranger than fiction
We didn’t make up the $10 million to $25 mil­
lion number. In 2008, BusinessWeek Magazine 
published an article called “Computing Heads 
for the Clouds,” by Rachael King (http://
i m a g e s . b u s i n e s s w e e k . c o m /
ss/08/08/0804_cloudcomputing/1.
htm). The magazine surveyed 11 different large 
data centers throughout the United States.

51
 Chapter 5: Seeing the Advantages of the Highly Scaled Data Center
Where’s the bulk of the money going? This might surprise you. 
	
✓	42 percent: Hardware, software, disaster recovery arrangements, unin­
terrupted power supplies, and networking. (Costs are spread over time, 
amortized, because they are a combination of capital expenditures and 
regular payments.)
	
✓	58 percent: Heating, air conditioning, property and sales taxes, and 
labor costs. (In fact, as much as 40 percent of annual costs are labor 
alone.)
The reality of the traditional data center is further complicated because most 
of the costs maintain existing (and sometimes aging) applications and infra­
structure. Some estimates show 80 percent of spending on maintenance. 
	
Before you conclude that you need to throw out the data center and just move 
to the cloud, know the nature of the applications and the workloads at the 
core of data centers:
	
✓	Most data centers run a lot of different applications and have a wide 
variety of workloads. 
	
✓	Many of the most important applications running in data centers are 
actually used by only a relatively few employees. For example, trans­
action management applications (which are critical to a company’s 
relationship to customers and suppliers) might only be used by a few 
employees. 
	
✓	Some applications that run on older systems are taken off the market 
(no longer sold) but are still necessary for business. 
Because of the nature of these applications, it probably wouldn’t be cost 
effective to move these environments to the cloud.
Cloud data center
In this case cloud data centers means data centers with 10,000 or more serv­
ers on site, all devoted to running very few applications that are built with 
consistent infrastructure components (such as racks, hardware, OS, network­
ing, and so on).
	
What’s the key difference in the cost structure of a traditional data center and 
a cloud data center? One of the most important factors is that cloud data cen­
ters aren’t remodeled traditional data centers. 

52
Part II: Understanding the Nature of the Cloud 
Cloud data centers are 
	
✓	Constructed for a different purpose. 
	
✓	Created at a different time than the traditional data center.
	
✓	Built to a different scale.
	
✓	Not constrained by the same limitations.
	
✓	Perform different workloads than traditional data centers. 
Because of this design approach, the economics of a cloud data center are 
significantly different. 
To create a basis for analyzing this, we used figures on the costs of creating a 
cloud data center described in a Microsoft paper titled “The Cost of a Cloud: 
Research Problems in Data Center Networks” by Albert Greenberg, James 
Hamilton, David A. Maltz, and Parveen Patel. 
We took estimates for how much it cost to build a cloud data center and 
looked at three cost factors: 
	
✓	Labor costs were 6 percent of the total costs of operating the cloud data 
center. 
	
✓	Power distribution and cooling were 20 percent.
	
✓	Computing costs were 48 percent.
Of course, the cloud data center has some different costs than the traditional 
data center (such as buying land and construction).
	
This explanation of costs is designed to give you an idea of where the differ­
ence between the traditional data center and the cloud data center are. The 
upfront costs in constructing cloud data centers are actually spread across 
hundreds of thousands of individual users. Therefore, after they’re con­
structed, these cloud data centers are well positioned to be profitable because 
they support so many customers with a large number of servers executing a 
single application.
Scaling the Cloud
From the provider’s point of view, the whole point of cloud computing is 
to achieve economies of scale by managing a very large pool of computing 
resources in a highly economic and efficient fashion.

53
 Chapter 5: Seeing the Advantages of the Highly Scaled Data Center
A picture makes it a little clearer. Figure 5-1 shows a graph of the cost per 
user of running just one software application using different kinds of com­
puter resources; this is charted against the number of users. We need to 
emphasize that we’re talking about just one application — not even two or 
three. In Figure 5-1, that one application runs in different computing environ­
ments, starting with inefficient dedicated servers all the way up to massively 
scaled grids.
	
An important point to note is that the Y-axis of user populations is logarith­
mic. That means that the curve is much less steep than if we drew it on a pro­
portional scale of equal steps. If we drew it on a proportional scale, we’d need 
miles of paper.
We deliberately didn’t put units on the X-axis. Instead, note the following:
	
✓	One end of the X-axis shows data center costs between $1–$50 per user 
per annum. That reflects, for example, the prices that Google charges 
for Google Apps or even the cost of providing free email (from Google, 
Microsoft, or Yahoo, which is paid for by ads). The cost per user is 
extremely low. 
	
✓	The other end of the X-axis shows data center costs between $1,000–
$5,000 per user per annum. That might be the cost of, for example, pro­
viding a print server that’s almost always idle.

Part II: Understanding the Nature of the Cloud 
Basically, on the left in Figure 5-1 you have very efficient use of computer 
resources and, on the right, very inefficient use of resources.
Points on the line indicate the kind of computing resources that serve spe­
cific group sizes:
	
✓	Inefficient servers: This is a 1:1 user-to-server ratio (or close to 1). The 
cost of managing a single server in a data center will be thousands of 
dollars per year and this is as expensive as computing ever gets per 
user.
	
✓	Virtual machines: Applications and user numbers that can’t use a whole 
server get virtualized (split among several virtual servers). This is effi­
cient (making better use of underused servers), but also inefficient (vir­
tualization requires significant overhead, as does running the multiple 
guest operating systems). 
	
✓	Efficient servers (and small clusters): User populations from the hun­
dreds to 1,000 can be served reasonably efficiently with a single or multi­
ple servers if there’s only one application being run on a server; servers 
can be highly efficient, yielding a relatively low cost per user.
	
✓	Mainframe and large Unix clusters: They’re shown separately on the 
grid only for the sake of space. Both can handle very large database 
applications from thousands to tens of thousands of users. 
	
✓	Grids: From the hundreds of thousands to a million users, you’re in the 
area where Software as a Service (SaaS) vendors such as Salesforce.com 
operate. Business applications offered by SaaS vendors present a thorny 
scaling problem because it’s a transactional database application. The main 
Salesforce.com CRM application runs on a grid of about 1,000 computers.
	
✓	Large grids: Concurrent users above one million. Still a very heavy 
workload and only possible via a scale-out (which lets a single workload 
expand by using more of the identical inexpensive resources) approach 
with a grid. Twitter and Linked-In are examples.
	
✓	Massively scaled grid: This is for user populations in the tens of millions. 
Example: Each query on Google search is resolved by a purpose-built grid 
of up to 1,000 servers; Google routes queries to many such grids. Yahoo 
also has a massively scaled-out email system. It caters to more than 260 
million users, of which tens of millions must be active at a time.
The dotted box in Figure 5-1 indicates the traditional domain and kinds of 
resources of corporate computing. The same servers used in corporate envi­
ronments could be used just as easily in scaled-out arrangements, where 
workloads aren’t at all mixed. The reduction in per-user costs doesn’t, at

 Chapter 5: Seeing the Advantages of the Highly Scaled Data Center
the moment, come from using different computer equipment or different 
operating systems: It comes from running a small number (or even just one) 
workload and scaling it up as much as possible. That’s how cloud computing 
reduces costs dramatically.
	
No corporation that runs a mixed workload is ever going to achieve cloud 
computing’s economies of scale. 
But how do massively scaled data centers manage to get their per-user costs 
so very low? This becomes clear when you read about each area of data 
costs in Chapter 21.
Comparing Traditional and 
Cloud Data Center Costs
Before reading how to reduce data center costs, reread the traditional IT 
costs statistics:
	
✓	Portion of IT budget used to maintain and run existing systems: 
70–80 percent
	
✓	Portion of IT budget used to build and implement new capabilities: 
20–30 percent
Compare traditional and cloud data centers in Table 5-1.

Part II: Understanding the Nature of the Cloud 
Looking at the table, it becomes clear that the cloud data center is much sim­
pler to organize and operate and, because it is simple, it scales well. In other 
words, the larger you make it, the lower the costs per user are. In the next 
section, we examine some of these costs and see where the efficiencies arise.
Examining labor costs and productivity
Labor costs depend on several things:
	
✓	Technology managing the data center: Even improving that technology 
in a traditional corporate setting may reduce the cost of labor only a 
small amount.
	
✓	In what environment someone works: The labor cost per person is 
likely to be equivalent regardless of the data center type; the skills 
requirement is the same. But that person’s productivity varies depend­
ing on the environment. Operating the scaled cloud data center is much 
simpler.
	
The impact of this set of differences on labor costs is dramatic. Corporate 
data centers usually have a ratio of operational staff to severs of around 1 
person to 65 servers. In cloud data centers, that ratio is more like 1 person 
to 850 servers, and we’ve even come across better ratios than that. This is a 
10-to-1 improvement in the productivity of labor (or possibly more — maybe 
going as high as 20 to 1). 
Wondering where you are
The traditional setup’s 58 percent costs depend a lot on location:
	
✓	Electricity fees
	
✓	Local taxes 
	
✓	Labor costs
Compare a data center in North Carolina with one in New York (keeping in 
mind no two data centers have the same software workloads). Better to con­
sider technology costs separately and see where economies arise, which we 
do in the following sections.

57
 Chapter 5: Seeing the Advantages of the Highly Scaled Data Center
Electric power
Computers have been using more electricity in recent years and, at 7 percent 
of corporate data centers’ costs (including heating and cooling), the cost is 
significant. Cloud data centers use even more: Electricity costs hover around 
12 percent. 
Cloud data centers can do the following:
	
✓	Put the data center where the cheap power is. Electricity fluctuates in 
price from year to year and costs are difficult to control. 
	
✓	Negotiate a discounted power contract with its power company. 
Cloud data centers, by their level of usage, fall into the least expensive 
category.
	
	If a cloud data center is contemplating building a data center,it can 
negotiate a long-term deal for an even deeper discount than industrial 
usage gives them. Put the data center very close to the power plant and 
bargain for a lower cost supply based on these points:
 
• Distance from the power station (because less electrical power is 
lost in transit). 
 
• Minimal power interruption from electrical storms (if you have a 
private circuit direct to the power station).
Outsourcing
Because power is so critical to the cloud data 
center, organizations have to consider the 
availability and cost of energy sources as they 
would any primary data center resource.
Electricity sources include the following:
	✓	Hydroelectric is generally expensive when 
it has to travel far to customers, but other­
wise it’s usually cheap and can be the ideal 
source of power for a data center.
	✓	Oil prices change, which can cause cost 
fluctuation.
	✓	Liquified natural gas (LNG) suffers from the 
same changing fuel prices as oil.
	✓	Coal is more stable in price, but not green.
	✓	Nuclear is inexpensive to run but expensive 
to build and gain approval

58
Part II: Understanding the Nature of the Cloud 
Other location costs
Other location related costs when building a new data center include the 
following:
	
✓	Land costs: The days of siting data centers in skyscrapers in Manhattan 
are over. Better to use cheap land with low property taxes. There are 
exceptions, of course. For example, in algorithmic financial trading, 
latency lost due to networking (communications) distance directly 
impacts revenue.
	
✓	Building costs: A designed-entirely-as-a-data-center building is a must. 
 
• Heat management is the overriding priority, so building out almost 
certainly makes more sense than building up. Cool geographical 
areas may make more sense than hotter ones. 
 
• Safety is another important consideration. Data centers need to be 
electrically safe, secure, and fireproof.
	
✓	Staff: Although staff costs are very low for the cloud data center, as a 
percentage of the whole, location in areas (or even countries) where 
staff costs are low can further reduce staff costs.
	
✓	Investment incentives and taxation: Many areas of the world, including 
states in the United States, welcome inward investment and help finance 
it with very generous tax exemptions and cash incentives. Take advan­
tage of these opportunities when you find them.
In the next chapter, we examine technology costs, which also favor the cloud 
data center in many ways. The simple fact is that data centers as they exist 
now, in the enterprise, are a cottage industry that’s going to change in the 
coming years by the mass-production efficiencies of cloud data centers.

Foundation for Scaling 
Computer Systems

I
n Chapter 5, we contrast the non-technology operational costs of the tra­
ditional data center with those of the cloud data center (electricity, cool­
ing, space, and so on). In this chapter, we contrast technology costs between 
the traditional data center and the cloud data center. 
We divided into four areas the places where IT spends money:
	
✓	Hardware, including servers, storage, and so on 
	
✓	A power supply for those systems and how to keep them from overheating
	
✓	Networking and communications equipment so the systems can 
interoperate
	
✓	Electricity to support the overall data center 
	
Some elements are more expensive than others. In Chapter 5, we look at two 
reports that detail the costs of running traditional and cloud data centers. 
Using this same set of numbers, we calculated the costs of the areas. The 
results are quite interesting. The greatest expense in the traditional data 
center is server and storage hardware, which accounts for 36 percent of the 
amortized costs. The second biggest expense? Power distribution and cool­
ing. Amortized over a year, power and cooling are 20 percent of the total 

60
Part II: Understanding the Nature of the Cloud 
expenses. Both networking and electricity each add 12 percent to the total 
expense number per year. Add hardware and its supporting power and cool­
ing, and you have 56 percent of the technology related costs.
We discuss electricity costs in the previous chapter, but only from the per­
spective of arranging for an inexpensive supply. In this chapter, we take on 
the issue of using that electricity efficiently.
Server-ing Up Some Hardware 
	
Although we’d like to tell you that costs are static, clearly they aren’t. Costs 
for your data center hardware will vary dramatically depending on the type of 
workloads you support. 
Data storage is an excellent example of this variation. If a data center is feed­
ing video to the Internet from a vast video library (like YouTube does) the 
storage requirements are huge. However, storing short text messages (as 
Twitter does) doesn’t require a lot of space. Indeed, Twitter doesn’t even 
store its billions of messages indefinitely. The YouTube library, on the other 
hand, just keeps on growing.
Tradition! versus clouds
What does this mean when you look at the differences in the costs of hard­
ware between the traditional data center and the cloud data center? Look at 
a snapshot of each:
	
✓	Tradition: In a traditional data center, IT management has a structured 
process for purchasing hardware. Each year they talk to business units, 
determine what new applications to add or expand, and work with ven­
dors on the procurement process. In addition, most IT organizations 
refresh their hardware on a regular basis to make sure that things run 
smoothly and old systems are retired before they cause problems. 
	
✓	Cloud: When a business is creating a cloud data center (either a private 
one inside the firewall or a service provider) the process of procuring 
systems is very different. Because the cloud supports very different 
workloads, IT management doesn’t buy traditional hardware. Rather, IT 
management might go directly to an engineering company that designs 
the system boards and networking switches for them, and then take the 
contract to a manufacturer to have them build the precise hardware 
that they want.

61
 Chapter 6: Exploring the Technical Foundation for Scaling Computer Systems
	
The bottom line is that the cloud data center is well suited to buying precisely 
what you need in a very economical manner. In contrast, the traditional data 
center doesn’t have the same economies of scale. 
	
We aren’t being critical of the server products that are built and delivered by 
big computer manufacturers. Such engineering is difficult to criticize in its nat­
ural context. All such servers, whether mainframes or cheap commodity 
server boards, are designed for general circumstances of typical customers. 
It’s just really unlikely that the requirements of a cloud center are anywhere 
close to typical.
Considering cloud hardware
When your company is establishing a cloud data center, think about the 
hardware elements in a different way. The following sections summarize 
considerations.
Cooling
Cloud data centers have the luxury of being able to engineer the way systems 
(boards, chips, and more) are cooled. When systems are cooled via air condi­
tioning, they require tremendous amounts of power. However, purpose-built 
cloud data centers can be engineered to be cooled by water, for example 
(which is 3,000 times more efficient than air in cooling equipment). 
CPU, memory, and local disk
Traditional data tends to be filled with a lot of surplus equipment (either 
to support unanticipated workloads or because an application or process 
wasn’t engineered to be efficient). Surplus memory, CPUs, and disks take up 
valuable space and, of course, they need to be cooled. The cloud data center 
typically supports self-service provisioning of resources so capacity is added 
only when you need it. 
Data storage and networking
Data storage and networking need to be managed collectively if they’re going 
to be efficient. This problem has complicated the way the traditional data 
centers have been managed, and has forced organizations to buy a lot of 
additional hardware and software. The cloud data center can be engineered 
to overcome this problem. The cloud knows where its data needs to be 
because it is so efficient in the way it manages workloads. The cloud actually 
is engineered to manage data efficiently. 

62
Part II: Understanding the Nature of the Cloud 
Redundancy
Data centers must always move data around the network for backup and 
disaster recovery. Traditional data centers support so many different work­
loads that many approaches to backup and recovery have to be taken. This 
makes backing up and recovering data complicated and expensive. The 
cloud, in contrast, is designed to handle data workloads consistently. For 
example, in a cloud data center you can establish a global policy about how 
and when backups will be handled. This can be then handled in an automated 
manner, reducing the cost of handling backup and recovery. 
Software embedded within the data center
We talk a lot about software in the context of applications, but a considerable 
amount of software is linked at a systems level. This type of system level soft­
ware is a big cost in the traditional data center simply because there are so 
many more workloads with so many operating systems and related software 
elements. 
As you know, cloud data centers have fewer elements because they have 
simpler workloads. There are some differences in how software costs are 
managed depending on the type of cloud model. Cloud providers understand 
these costs well and design their offerings to maximize revenue. It will help 
you understand pricing by understanding the cost factors for each of the 
models.
The following gives you a sense of the difference between IaaS, PaaS, and 
SaaS when it comes to embedded software costs:
	
✓	An Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) operation is likely to have higher 
software costs because although it provides only an environment for 
running applications, it has to build that environment according to 
equivalent environments in corporate data centers. Therefore, the IaaS 
vendor has to spend a lot of resources on management and security 
software in addition to the operating systems. See Chapter 10 for more 
about IaaS.
	
✓	With a Platform as a Service (PaaS) operation, the provider delivers a 
full software stack. To reduce cost, the PaaS vendor is likely to provide 
a software stack consisting of proprietary components. The licens­
ing costs may be lower for IaaS than the PaaS environment because 
the operator is likely to force the use of specific software products. 
However, the PaaS vendor must maintain and support the software stack 
it provides. See Chapter 11 for more about PaaS.

63
 Chapter 6: Exploring the Technical Foundation for Scaling Computer Systems
	
✓	With Software as a Service (SaaS), the SaaS vendor provides a propri­
etary application as its value to customers. While the vendor invests in 
this software, it typically relies on partners to support many of the other 
functions. These vendors also take advantage of open-source compo­
nents. See Chapter 12 for more about SaaS. 
Open-source dynamic
	
The cloud is an economic and business model as much as a technology model. 
It isn’t surprising, then, that open-source software is an important element 
for almost all cloud providers. Some of it is very high quality and nearly all of 
it can be used for no license fee, as long as you obey the restrictions of the 
associated license. 
Open-source software has already become a business factor in the Internet 
service provider (ISP) business, with most ISPs providing an easily installed, 
highly functional software stack for building Web sites. Many cloud providers 
take open-source software as a foundation and customize it to optimize sup­
port for their workloads. 
The other software area that impacts costs is the way operating systems 
are handled in the data center. Under traditional operation, an OS has many 
background processes running. All such processes have a function and quite 
a few of them run by default, whether you need them or not. Some of them 
are keeping logs, some are handling messages from the network, some fire off 
scheduled jobs, some handle printing, some provide directory services, and 
so on. They all sit there happily chewing up CPU cycles. None of them should 
be there unless they have a specific role to play.
	
In a traditional environment, no one would think of deleting useful background 
processes, but nothing superfluous should run in an environment that prizes 
efficient resource usage. Not only that, but if you’re running a cloud data 
center, you may be interested in rewriting some of these tasks because you 
need them to run slightly differently. That’s why open source plays a large 
role in cloud operations.
Economies of Scale
We spend a lot of time in this chapter saying why the economics of the cloud 
are so different than that of the traditional data center. Of course, not every 
workload is right for the cloud. 

64
Part II: Understanding the Nature of the Cloud 
Benefitting enormously
However, when the workload is right for the cloud there are many economic 
benefits: 
	
✓	Better communications prices: Very large data centers can negotiate 
with their communications provider. They may buy a great deal of band­
width, but they won’t be paying such a high rate per gigabyte for a guar­
anteed service.
	
✓	Predictable network traffic: It’s tougher to do if the scaled data center 
is IaaS or PaaS, because the overall workload is less homogeneous.
	
✓	Network virtualization: You can gain economies of scale if a network 
is tailored to support the networking hardware. Google, for example, 
designs its own switches.
	
Very application-specific scaled data centers are designed to be much more 
efficient. The important point here is this: Executing CPU instructions is what 
a data center does. That’s why it’s there. Efficient software is the primary opti­
mization the cloud data center should be concerned with.
Optimizing otherwise
A company builds a cloud data center (or several) with the goal of keeping 
throughput costs as low as possible. It doesn’t matter whether it’s IaaS, PaaS, 
or SaaS — the metric that matters is the cost of executing each task. (Well, 
other metrics do matter — the cost of managing each byte of data stored 
and the cost of each byte of information transmitted or received by the data 
center — but they’re the same kind of metric.)
Backup and disaster recovery
	
The three-data-center strategy with mirroring looks promising as a means of 
never needing to have backups (or UPS). It’s really inexpensive for disaster 
recovery and, if you have a global business, you may even be able to load 
balance across three data centers in the United States, Europe, and the Far 
East. In many instances, the workload will follow the sun, which may also help 
reduce costs.
System management
There’s a potentially big win in the system management area. Part of root 
cause analysis and maintenance can be carried out preemptively by service 
management processors designed for the job. Because you control the OS, 

65
 Chapter 6: Exploring the Technical Foundation for Scaling Computer Systems
you can also insert an agent (that gathers the data you need and no other 
data) in every instance of the OS. You will end up with a purpose-built 
Configuration Management Database (CMDB) that actually works. You can 
ensure purity of software across the data center and you can upgrade the 
whole environment only every 18 months, say.
Security
You can bolt down the whole data center with a set of closely controlled 
permissions. The main worry is that someone (external or internal) manages 
to run a rogue process that does something nasty. But if there’s only one 
closely controlled mechanism for loading any executable, that’s never going 
to happen. You can even design that into both the OS and the system man­
agement capabilities. Security is often an afterthought in corporate IT, but it 
may be possible to write it into the application in PaaS and SaaS operations.
Client caching
Put as much processing as possible on the customer’s client device (PC, Mac, 
or Smartphone) so it isn’t executed in the data center. Naturally, you put the 
interface on the client, but you can design the architecture to maximize the 
client. The beauty is that the customer probably won’t mind because most 
client devices have CPU cycles to spare.
Keeping the Bottom Line in Mind
	
We want you to take away two things from this chapter:
	
✓	The traditional data center isn’t designed for single workloads and 
is therefore more expensive to operate. In situations where complex, 
mixed workloads are demanded, the cloud data center will not be more 
economical. However, when a workload can be optimized, the cloud 
center is the most efficient and cost-effective model. 
	
✓	The various kinds of cloud data centers have different cost profiles. 
The more complex the cloud environment, the more expensive it is to 
operate; therefore, customers will pay more. IaaS and PaaS both have 
mixed workloads that increase the cost. A SaaS model consisting of 
a single workload will be the most cost effective for the provider to 
manage and therefore is the most economical model.

Checking the Cloud’s 
Workload Strategy 
In This Chapter
▶	Getting ahold of workloads 
▶	Putting risks on the sale to weigh
▶	Putting workloads to the real-world test
L
ots of hardware, software, networking, and services have to be brought 
together to make a cloud environment into a reality. Clearly, making a 
cloud work means that workloads have to be managed efficiently. How does 
this happen? You can’t simply take all the data and all the services and put 
them into a big cloud in the sky. In fact, for a cloud to work well, it must be 
well architected and well organized. In this chapter, we take a look at what 
happens with workloads in the cloud — how they’re managed and how 
they’re orchestrated.
Managing Workloads in the Cloud
	
How do you organize the cloud? The basic requirement is that workloads need 
to be organized. A workload is an independent service or collection of code 
that can be executed. Therefore, a workload doesn’t depend on outside ele­
ments. A workload can be a small or complete application.
You must be able to balance two things:
	
✓	The applications or components running in the cloud 
	
✓	The needs of the business to perform predictably, especially during 
peak loads

68
Part II: Understanding the Nature of the Cloud 
Organizations have to actively manage workloads so they know 
	
✓	How their applications are running
	
✓	What they’re doing
	
✓	How much an individual department should be charged for its use of 
services
A business needs to plan for their workloads, even when they’re using an 
external cloud provider. Management needs to understand the types of work­
loads they’re putting into a cloud. Workloads can be everything from a data-
intensive workload to a storage or a transaction processing workload.
Thinking of workloads as 
well-planned services
The cloud requires that workloads have to be handled in a very abstracted 
manner. The abstraction is a way to keep the technical details away from the 
user. The result of this abstraction is a type of service that makes it easier to 
have a well-defined function with a defined purpose. This service lives inside 
a container with an Application Programming Interface (API) so it can be 
easily moved from one place to another. 
If you’re familiar with a service-oriented architecture, you probably recog­
nize that this might sound a lot like a business service. A business service is a 
function or process designed to include well-defined Web services interfaces. 
Therefore, this type of service is designed for many different situations, 
which is an important concept for the cloud.
A brief history of workload management
The function of managing workloads isn’t a new 
concept. It’s been around for decades, first in 
the mainframe market and then in Unix and 
Linux. Life was a lot easier in the mainframe era 
where there were defined techniques for man­
aging a more unified workload. Things changed 
dramatically in a more chaotic, heterogeneous 
computing environment. Companies had to 
provide components that allowed processes to 
run across unrelated systems. They needed to 
be able to make changes to configurations in 
near real time. For example, companies had to 
take into account managing workloads related 
to CPU, memory, storage I/O, and networking 
foundations. They also had to take into account 
rebalancing workloads when new applications 
were added or when new business processes 
were implemented.

69
 Chapter 7: Checking the Cloud’s Workload Strategy
Different workload types
	
Two types of workloads exist: 
	
✓	Workloads that can be executed at any time in batch mode 
	
✓	Workloads that need to be executed in real time
For example, an insurance company is likely to have a workload that calcu­
lates interest rate. This doesn’t have to happen immediately. In contrast, an 
online retail system that calculates taxes on a purchase needs to be executed 
in real time. Many business information systems that help management 
understand the status of their business are batch workloads. A credit card 
payment system is a real-time workload.
You might have a single workload that’s an entire application used by a 
group of customers. In other situations, a smaller service may be used in 
many different contexts. There might be a workload that’s a payment service 
platform. This payment service might be live in a cloud and may be used 
by many different software developers who all need a payment engine (so 
they can collect payments from their customers without building their own 
engine). Many Platform as a Service vendors offer workloads or services like 
them to their partners.
Workloads as self-contained entities 
If workloads are self-contained entities, what are the characteristics of these 
services?
	
✓	A workload has no dependencies. It’s a discrete set of application logic 
that can be executed independently of a specific application.
	
✓	The workload interface must be consistent. Currently, the most prag­
matic, well-accepted interfaces are based on XML(eXtensible Markup 
Language). XML-based interfaces can keep the data independent of each 
implementation; the process understands how a service is used. For 
example, the bill payment service with an XML interface knows that it 
calculates a bill based on usage.
	
✓	A workload may have rules or policies that apply in specific situa­
tions. There may be authorization and security policies associated with 
using a service for a particular function. There may be a rule about when 
to use a specific workload. For example, a workload such as an account­
ing process might need to be executed at the end of a specific cycle. 
Therefore, although a workload can be thought of as a container or ser­
vice, it will be used in conjunction with both simple and very complex 
processes.

70
Part II: Understanding the Nature of the Cloud 
Creating interfaces between containers
Providing interfaces such as XML-based or APIs is a key factor in ensuring 
that workloads can be managed effectively in the cloud. With a well-defined 
interface, a developer has a method of cleanly linking one service to another. 
If you have a series of workloads placed in neat containers without depen­
dencies to other services, you have a better chance of ensuring a flexible 
environment that can support changing workloads. 
	
Therefore, one of the imperatives of the cloud is that workloads be dynamic. 
These workloads don’t serve a single master. They’re used by many different 
customers in many different situations. This type of flexibility is the reason 
many companies are moving to the cloud (or considering the cloud’s ability 
to solve business problems). 
	
Workloads can be combined. This has the impact of creating dependencies 
between these workloads, but in a controlled manner. Two workloads might 
be linked together to fulfill a task. As long as this link is documented, it can be 
done safely. Why is creating a dependency such a potential problem? If you 
have a service that expects to use a particular operating system, you can’t use 
that service in an environment that uses another operating system. 
	
Workloads live in a container that perform a definitive function without depen­
dencies. A workload also needs to have well-defined interfaces if they’re to be 
used in many combinations.
You know that within the cloud it’s important to have specific containers that 
support workloads. But how do the interfaces between containers work so 
you can optimize their use? To understand this, it is important to understand 
XML a little more. 
Discovering how XML fits in
We think that XML-based web services interfaces are going to become the 
primary way that the cloud connects containers. 
XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language. To understand its value, break it 
into parts:
	
✓	A set of instructions that you add to a collection of words, pictures, and 
so on, that controls their on-screen appearance, formatting, and behavior. 
	
✓	Tags that you define and embed in the content, and then write programs 
that write programs that agree on how data is defined within the context 
of your container. 

71
 Chapter 7: Checking the Cloud’s Workload Strategy
If many different containers or services all use the same language to explain 
to each other what they do and how they can be used, these services can 
much more easily talk, connect, and send messages to each other.
Using container workloads: Case study 
How do containers or services work in a cloud-based environment? Imagine 
that you have many functions within a cloud. If you place traditional pro­
grams in the cloud without any structure, all you have is one big workload 
that can typically conduct a single business function. Most organizations 
wouldn’t get economic value.
Here’s a real-world company that did get economic value: Intuit is a well-
established software company that sells a product called QuickBooks — it’s 
the most popular accounting software for small and medium businesses. 
The cloud hides a lot of infrastructure and complexity away from the end 
customer, but there are, in fact, a lot of moving parts. The company decided 
to provide other services, including Platform as a Service and Software as a 
Service; customers could use the workload of a business invoice that they 
create online and transmit electrically to customers. 
However, Inuit didn’t stop there. The company went on to create a series of 
services or workloads with which its partners could easily enhance their ser­
vice delivery to customers. For example, Intuit designed a payment system 
to bill its customers for products and services. It put this service into a well-
defined container with XML-based interfaces and let its partners use that 
service as part of their own product (offered within the Inuit platform as a 
service environment). Therefore, the software partner didn’t have to write 
its own complex payment software. It could rely on the workload that Intuit 
designed and tested.
	
The bottom line is that creating workloads with well-defined interfaces makes 
delivery software in the cloud a pragmatic and cost-effective way to work with 
customers.
Balancing Risk and Practical Models
Workloads can be very complicated to manage. In the traditional data center, 
workloads tend to be thought of as full applications rather than individual work­
loads. Typically, when the application is complex and very expensive to run, 
expenses tend to be divided across the departments that use that application. 

72
Part II: Understanding the Nature of the Cloud 
Now companies look at other factors, such as the level of service required 
by that department. For example, what happens if the system is unavailable 
for two hours a day? If that system produces monthly research reports, the 
company’s business isn’t at risk. However, if the system is responsible for 
real-time security monitoring, two hours of downtime could severely impact 
the company. 
	
Creating a more rigorous service level agreement (SLA) for the security moni­
toring system is going to be money well spent.
This type of balancing of risks and service level agreements are well under­
stood in the traditional data center. However, when you introduce a cloud 
infrastructure into the mix, the level of risk changes dramatically. What is the 
nature of your cloud provider? Does the organization you have selected pro­
vide the type of SLAs that match your level of risk? What does the workload 
actually look like? If it is a distinct workload, it may be easy to pick up that 
workload and move it to another location — either another cloud provider or 
back into your own data center if things don’t work out.
	
If you’re dealing with a brand-new service that isn’t critical to the company’s 
well-being, it is probably cost effective to trust the cloud provider to deliver 
the level of service that you need. You might not need to verify it on a con­
sistent basis. You’re storing information that isn’t mission critical. You are 
required to store that data and you know that the cloud service provider has 
a proven track record. Of course, no matter what you are moving to the cloud, 
the security and protection of that data is still your responsibility. 
However, you might have a very different situation. What if you’re consid­
ering moving to the cloud an existing workload that has run in your data 
center for years. It is a high-risk service. Few companies run a similar service. 
A cloud vendor approaches you with an offer to take over this workload. 
Although it seems like the right thing to do initially, you might be surprised 
if you dig a little deeper. By the time you add the required service levels and 
the added security, the cost combined with the risk may change your think­
ing. Because this particular workload has been optimized to run effectively in 
the existing data center, it may actually cost a lot more to run the workload 
in the cloud. 
	
Do your homework before you reach conclusions about the best and safest 
approach for your company.

73
 Chapter 7: Checking the Cloud’s Workload Strategy
Testing Workloads in the Real World
After you and your partners in the cloud business have created standardized 
workloads, you can reuse them in different situations. Companies that are 
part of your cloud infrastructure can help you move quickly with the cloud 
as the scalable platform. But you aren’t done just because you have created 
workloads. 
	
The key to a well-functioning infrastructure is that workloads in both clouds 
and within your own environment have to be linked together based on the 
business process you’re trying to achieve.
What does this mean in the real world? Take the example of the company 
that has started using the cloud to manage a sales management system for its 
sales force, which is spread across 100 countries. When a salesperson makes 
a sale, he needs to send that transaction outside the cloud to an internally 
run system that takes the order, checks the customer credit through a third 
party, and confirms that transaction. But it doesn’t end there. Now that the 
customer has been cleared, the inventory system needs to be notified and a 
product is shipped through another partner that manages transportation for 
goods and services.
Workload management isn’t complete unless it’s in context with asset man­
agement (how organizations manage the hardware, software, and services 
lifecycles). Asset management in this context needs to embrace 
	
✓	License management
	
✓	Technology evaluation 
	
✓	Capability planning
Runbook
Ironically, this approach to linking workloads 
together is based on an age-old function called 
Runbook automation. Runbook automation 
started in the mainframe era when companies 
needed to consistently automate processes 
to do everything from executing and verifying 
a transaction to ensuring that a print job was 
processed on the right printer at the right time. 
Today, Runbook automation is the technique 
used in the process of integrating, orchestrat­
ing, and initiating tasks between service com­
ponents that need to run between systems, 
applications, and platforms.

74
Part II: Understanding the Nature of the Cloud 
What services are going to live in the cloud? Do you need to account for any 
licenses in the cloud? 
When you’re adding new services, you have to understand 
	
✓	Their component parts
	
✓	Where they live 
	
✓	How they relate to other services 
For example, you might have an important workload moved to a cloud. 
Which internal applications and groups use that service? If that workload 
is changed, are the right departments alerted? In managing a cloud-based 
workload or even hybrid workloads (that live in both the cloud and on prem­
ise), you have to make sure that you’re managing the configuration data 
efficiently. Configuration management software (an application that tracks 
and controls changes to software code) helps define workloads and tracks 
changes to those workloads.
Company management must look at these series of workloads and test them 
as though they were an integrated system. For example, you might have 
workloads running across many different cloud environments and within 
data centers. You might use a Software as a Service application that needs 
to send data to your internal accounts receivable system. You might have a 
business process that requires that a new customer receive an email confirm­
ing receipt of an order. You therefore need to think holistically about how 
your workloads will work together. 
	
What are the requirements for companies dealing with workloads that 
incorporate security, coordination, workflow, and dependency tracking? 
Companies need to clearly test these scenarios before attempting to put this 
into practice in the real world.

Chapter 8
Managing Data 
In This Chapter
▶	Ensuring security and privacy 
▶	Recognizing management resources 
▶	Discussing questions with your cloud vendor
T
here is no way around it: The issues surrounding data in a cloud envi­
ronment is a big and complicated topic. The reality is that data is the 
lifeblood of organizations. Therefore, how you manage data, regardless of 
where it lives, is critical to the health of your business. Data has an entire 
lifecycle: It’s created, changed, secured, stored (or destroyed), and governed. 
Although this is the normal process within the data center, forgetting man­
agement elements is easy when an outside service manages that data. 
In this chapter, we discuss the key aspects of managing data in the cloud, 
including 
	
✓	Data security and privacy (including data controls and managing the 
movement of data from point A to point B)
	
✓	Managing the resources for large-scale data processing 
	
✓	Data storage
Declaring Data Types
The amount of data available for company use is exploding. In fact, the very 
nature of data is changing:
	
✓	Data diversity is increasing. Data in the cloud is becoming more 
diverse. In addition to traditional structured data (revenue, name, and 
so on), it includes emails, contracts, images, blogs, and more.
	
✓	The amount of data is increasing. Just think of how many videos 
YouTube manages or all the images Facebook handles. Even in the tradi­
tional data realm, organizations are starting to aggregate huge amounts 

76
Part II: Understanding the Nature of the Cloud 
of data (to solve problems that they could never have imagined tackling 
in the past decade). These might be one-time efforts or ongoing research 
projects that require massive amounts of computing resources under 
very controlled circumstances. 
	
✓	Latency requirements are becoming more demanding. Companies are 
increasingly demanding lower latency (for instance, the time for data to 
get from one point to another) for many applications. Think real-time 
data for Radio Frequency ID tags (RFID) as one example. This requires a 
powerful management environment.
Even in the traditional data realm, organizations are starting to aggregate 
huge amounts of data to solve problems that they could never have imagined 
tackling in the past decade. The cloud can 
	
✓	Provide resources to access data on demand and at a much lower price 
point than the company can. 
	
✓	Help businesses looking to support the use of data collaboratively 
across their employees, customers, and business partners. 
	
The cost associated with managing data on demand is a controversial topic 
in cloud circles. It’s one thing to access data stored in the cloud. Using data 
across applications that are in two different clouds can get expensive; it might 
involve real-time synchronization or permanent cloud-hosted data, regardless 
of the current application demand. 
 Securing Data in the Cloud
There are three key areas of concern related to security and privacy of data: 
	
✓	Location of your data 
	
✓	Control of your data 
	
✓	Secure transfer of your data
Each of these areas is discussed in this section. 
	
Because security is such a big issue, we’ve devoted all of Chapter 15 to it. In 
addition, if you want to find out more about security in the cloud, we point 
you to the Cloud Security Alliance (www.cloudsecurityalliance.org) for 
more information.
In the cloud, company data that was previously secured inside of the firewall 
may now move outside to feed any number of business applications and 
processes. 

77
 Chapter 8: Managing Data
	
Cloud providers must ensure the security and privacy of your data, but you 
are ultimately responsible for your company’s data. This means that industry 
and government regulations created to protect personal and business infor­
mation still apply even if the data is managed or stored by an outside vendor. 
For example, the European Union has implemented a complex set of data 
protection laws for its member states. In addition, industry regulations (such 
as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act [HIPAA]) must be 
followed whether or not your data is in the cloud. 
	
Data privacy and security issues are overriding concerns for companies evalu­
ating a cloud services strategy. For this reason, many companies are testing 
public cloud environments with smaller, more-contained implementations 
that don’t rely on data subject to compliance regulations. 
Data location in the cloud
After data goes into the cloud, you may not have control over where it’s 
stored geographically. Consider these issues:
	
✓	Specific country laws: Laws governing data differ across geographic 
boundaries. Your own country’s legal protections may not apply if your 
data is located outside of the country. A foreign government may be able 
to access your data or keep you from fully controlling your data when 
you need it.
	
✓	Data transfer across country borders: A global company with subsid­
iaries or partners (or clients for that matter) in other countries may 
be concerned about cross-border transfer of data due to local laws. 
Virtualization makes this an especially tough problem because the cloud 
provider might not know where the data is at any particular moment. 
For more about virtualization, see Chapter 17. 
	
✓	Co-mingling of data: Even if your data is in a country that has laws 
you’re comfortable with, your data may be physically stored in a data­
base along with data from other companies. This raises concerns about 
virus attacks or hackers trying to get at another company’s data.
	
✓	Secondary data use: In public cloud situations, your data or metadata may 
be vulnerable to alternative or secondary uses by the cloud service provider. 
 
• Without proper controls or service level agreements, your data 
may be used for marketing purposes (and merged with data from 
other organizations for these alternative uses). The recent uproar 
about Facebook mining data from its network is an example. 
 
• The service provider may own any metadata (see the “Sorting Out 
Metadata Matters” section later in this chapter for a description of 
metadata) it has created to help manage your data, lessening your 
ability to maintain control over your data.

78
Part II: Understanding the Nature of the Cloud 
Data control in the cloud
Controls include the governance policies set in place to make sure that your 
data can be trusted. The integrity, reliability, and confidentiality of your data 
must be beyond reproach. And this holds for cloud providers too.
For example, assume that you’re using a cloud service for word processing. 
The documents you create are stored with the cloud provider. These docu­
ments belong to your company and you expect to control access to those 
documents. No one should be able to get them without your permission, but 
perhaps a software bug lets other users access the documents. This privacy 
violation resulted from a malfunctioning access control. This is an example of 
the type of slip-up that you want to make sure doesn’t happen.
	
You must understand what level of controls will be maintained by your cloud 
provider and consider how these controls can be audited. 
Here is a sampling of the different types of controls designed to ensure the 
completeness and accuracy of data input, output, and processing:
	
✓	Input validation controls to ensure that all data input to any system or 
application are complete, accurate, and reasonable.
	
✓	Processing controls to ensure that data are processed completely and 
accurately in an application.
	
✓	File controls to make sure that data are manipulated accurately in any 
type of file (structured and unstructured).
	
✓	Output reconciliation controls to ensure that data can be reconciled 
from input to output.
	
✓	Access controls to ensure that only those who are authorized to access 
the data can do so. Sensitive data must also be protected in storage and 
transfer. Encrypting the data can help to do this. 
	
✓	Change management controls to ensure that data can’t be changed with­
out proper authorization.
	
✓	Backup and recovery controls. Many security breaches come from 
problems in data backup. It is important to maintain physical and logical 
controls over data backup. For example, what mechanisms are in place 
to ensure that no one can physically get into a facility? 

79
 Chapter 8: Managing Data
	
✓	Data destruction controls to ensure that when data is permanently 
deleted it is deleted from everywhere — including all backup and redun­
dant storage sites.
Securing data for transport in the cloud
Regarding data transport, keep two things in mind:
	
✓	Make sure that no one can intercept your data as it moves from point A 
to point B in the cloud. 
	
✓	Make sure that no data leaks (malicious or otherwise) from any storage 
in the cloud. 
None of these concepts are new; the goal of securely transporting data has 
been around as long as the Internet.
In the cloud, the journey from point A to point B might take on three different 
forms:
	
✓	Within a cloud environment
	
✓	Over the public Internet between an enterprise and a cloud provider
	
✓	Between clouds
The security process may include segregating your data from other compa­
nies’ data and then encrypting it by using an approved method. In addition, 
you may want to ensure the security of older data that remains with a cloud 
vendor after you no longer need it.
A virtual private network (VPN) is one way to manage the security of data 
during its transport in a cloud environment. A VPN essentially makes the 
public network your own private network instead of using dedicated connec­
tivity. A well-designed VPN needs to incorporate two things:
	
✓	A firewall to act as a barrier to between the public Internet and any pri­
vate network (like at your enterprise). 
	
✓	Encryption to protect your sensitive data from hackers; only the com­
puter that you send it to should have the key to decode the data.

80
Part II: Understanding the Nature of the Cloud 
	
This gives you a taste of some of the pressing security and privacy issues sur­
rounding data. The key point here is that no matter which cloud vendor you 
choose, there are no hard-and-fast rules surrounding security. You really can’t 
assume anything. 
Your level of concern about security may vary, depending on the governance 
requirements for your data. In some situations, such as with a test environ­
ment processing test data, you may have limited concerns about some of 
these security and privacy issues. In other situations where you may have a 
lot at risk if the security and privacy of your data is compromised, you need 
to evaluate how your cloud vendor treats the security issues.
In addition, you will need to determine how you can audit the ongoing secu­
rity processes to make sure that your data remains secure. 
Concerns about privacy and security of data have contributed to many 
companies’ interest in developing private cloud environments — where 
company data remains inside the firewall — and to consider hybrid cloud 
environments — which incorporate some elements of a private cloud and 
some elements of a public cloud. Please refer to Chapter 15 for more 
information on security in the cloud.
Decoding encryption
Encryption comes in many forms:
	✓	In symmetric key encryption, each com­
puter has a secret code that it uses to 
encrypt data. Only these computers know 
the code. The code also contains the key to 
decoding the message. 
	✓	In public key encryption, there are two 
keys: a public key and a private key. The 
private key is known only to one computer; 
the public key is given by the computer to 
any other computer that wants to commu­
nicate with it. To decode a message, the 
computer uses the public key and its own 
private key. There are definitely some chal­
lenges to utilizing private keys in the cloud. 
The benefit of the cloud includes the ability 
to add capacity on demand and any addi­
tional security steps may slow down some 
of the processes.

81
 Chapter 8: Managing Data
Looking at Data, Scalability, 
and Cloud Services
The need to process continually increasing amounts of data is one of the key 
factors driving the demand for cloud services. 
For example, until YouTube, virtually all public video was stored by TV net­
works. The explosive amount of video (a type of data) currently available 
through YouTube was unimaginable prior to its creation in 1995. Today, you 
store videos, watch videos, and search for videos by using YouTube as your 
video provider (to handle the streaming of the video to your Web site).
A number of emerging technologies for managing these increasing volumes 
and diversity of data are worth mentioning:
	
✓	Resources to support large-scale processing and data mining in the 
cloud: One example of this type of computing-intensive application is 
scientific research for computational genomics. Other examples include 
business services for tracking and analyzing radio frequency identifica­
tion tags, analyzing news feeds in real time, providing real-time stock 
quotes to trading floors, and analyzing product data to provide real-time 
pricing promotions. Organizations supporting these types of applica­
tions are often in critical need of more IT infrastructure, computing 
power, and data management capabilities than they have internally.
	
✓	Databases and data stores in the cloud: New databases are being cre­
ated for the cloud environment. Some companies may just want to store 
their data there; others may be building services on top of the data.
	
✓	Data archiving in the cloud: Archiving data offsite has been popular for a 
number of years. Some cloud providers are trying to put a new spin on this.
In the following sections, we examine each of these technologies.
Large-scale data processing
The lure of cloud computing is its elasticity: You can add as much capacity 
as you need to process and analyze your data. The data might be processed 
on clusters of computers. This means that the analysis is occurring across 
machines. 

82
Part II: Understanding the Nature of the Cloud 
Companies are considering this approach to help them manage their supply 
chains and inventory control. Or, consider the case of a company processing 
product data, from across the country, to determine when to change a price 
or introduce a promotion. This data might come from the point-of-sale (POS) 
systems across multiple stores in multiple states. POS systems generate a 
lot of data, and the company might need to add computing capacity to meet 
demand.
This model is large-scale, distributed computing and a number of frameworks 
are emerging to support this model, including
	
✓	MapReduce, a software framework introduced by Google to support 
distributed computing on large sets of data. It is designed to take advan­
tage of cloud resources. This computing is done across large numbers 
of computers, called clusters. Each cluster is referred to as a node. 
MapReduce can deal with both structured and unstructured data. Users 
specify a map function that processes a key/value pair to generate a set 
of intermediate pairs and a reduction function that merges these pairs. 
	
✓	Apache Hadoop, an open-source distributed computing platform writ­
ten in Java and inspired by MapReduce. It creates a computer pool, 
each with a Hadoop file system. It then uses a hash algorithm to cluster 
data elements that are similar. Hadoop can create a map function of 
organized key/value pairs that can be output to a table, to memory, or 
to a temporary file to be analyzed. Three copies of the data exist so that 
nothing gets lost. 
Databases and data stores in the cloud
Given the scale of some of these applications, it isn’t surprising that new data­
base technologies are being developed to support this kind of computing. 
Some database experts believe that relational database models may have 
difficulty processing data across large numbers of servers — in other words, 
when the data is distributed across multiple machines. Performance can 
be slow when you’re executing complex queries that involve a join across 
a distributed environment. Additionally, in an old-style database cluster, 
data must either be replicated across the boxes in the cluster or partitioned 
between them. According to other database experts, this makes it hard to 
provision servers on demand. 
In response, some large cloud providers have developed their own data­
bases. Here’s a sample listing:

83
 Chapter 8: Managing Data
	
✓	Google Bigtable: This hybrid is sort of like one big table. Because tables 
can be large, they’re split at row boundaries into tablets, which might be 
100 megabytes or so. MapReduce is often used for generating and modi­
fying data stored in Bigtable. Bigtable is also the data storage vehicle 
behind Google’s App Engine (a platform for developing applications).
	
✓	Amazon SimpleDB: This Web service is for indexing and querying data. 
It’s used with two other Amazon products to store, process, and query 
data sets in the cloud. Amazon likens the database to a spreadsheet in 
that it has columns and rows with attributes and items stored in each. 
Unlike a spreadsheet, however, each cell can have multiple values and 
each item can have its own set of associated attributes. Amazon then 
automatically indexes the data.
	
✓	Cloud-based SQL: Microsoft has introduced a cloud-based SQL rela­
tional database called SQL Database (SDS). SDS provides data storage by 
using a relational model in the cloud and access to that data from cloud 
and client applications. It runs on the Microsoft Azure services platform. 
The Azure platform is an Internet-scale cloud-services platform hosted 
in Microsoft data centers; the platform provides an operating system 
and a set of developer services.
	
Numerous open-source databases are also being developed: 
	
✓	MongoDB (schema-free, document-oriented data store written in C++)
	
✓	CouchDB (Apache open-source database)
	
✓	LucidDB (Java/C++ open-source data warehouse)
It’s a matter of semantics
Lot of terms are floating around out there when 
it comes to databases in the cloud. Some pos­
sible terms you’ll hear include database as 
a service and cloud databases. What’s the 
difference?
Some experts use database as a service to 
describe vendors that offer clients a hosted 
database solution. The database is in the cloud, 
but you know that the cloud provider is man­
aging it and you know where the data center 
is physically located. You don’t pay for the 
hardware and you can run your analysis on this 
data and pay on a pay-per-use basis.
The term cloud database is used when the 
database is in the cloud, meaning that you may 
not know where the data physically resides.
There is also the situation where your database 
vendor (such as Oracle) might host its database 
in a cloud service, such as Amazon, and your 
contract is with the cloud vendor, not the data­
base vendor. 

84
Part II: Understanding the Nature of the Cloud 
Data archiving
Data backup and archiving is nothing new. In fact, many companies are used 
to archiving static, seldom-used data offsite. Much of this is driven by compli­
ance regulations that require companies to archive records for a number of 
years. 
The cloud has different data archiving models. In some models, the archive 
may be available on demand. In others, this may not be the case.
Sorting Out Metadata Matters
	
Metadata is of critical importance to the ongoing reliability and integrity of 
your data in cloud environments. This is because metadata provides the 
means for your data to be understood in context with its intended use or 
meaning. Metadata is defined as the definitions, mappings, and other charac­
teristics used to describe how to find, access, and use a company’s data (and 
software) components. 
One example of metadata is data related to an account number. This might 
include the number, description, data type, name, address, phone number, 
and privacy level. The term account number may be defined differently 
depending on the application, and it may be interpreted differently across 
multiple end-user companies or cloud service providers. 
Metadata helps make sense of the varied definitions and creates a consistent 
level of understanding about the data. Metadata — whether supplied and 
maintained by your company or your cloud service provider — can be used 
as the traffic cop to ensure that the data traffic is directed to the appropriate 
location at the right time.
Talking to Your Cloud Vendor about Data
You’re thinking about using some of the data services in the cloud. Before 
you sign the contract, remember that data (especially your company’s data) 
is a precious asset and you need to treat it as such. 
	
In addition to issues surrounding security and privacy of your data that we 
cover earlier in the chapter, we recommend asking your potential vendor 
about the following topics:

85
 Chapter 8: Managing Data
	
✓	Data integrity: What controls do you have to ensure the integrity of my 
data? For example, are there controls to make sure that all data input to 
any system or application is complete, accurate, and reasonable? What 
about any processing controls to make sure that data processing is 
accurate? And, there also need to be output controls in place to ensure 
that any output from any system, application, or process can be verified 
and trusted. This dovetails with the next bullet about any specific com­
pliance issues that your particular industry might have.
	
✓	Compliance: You are probably aware of any compliance issues particu­
lar to your industry. Obviously, you need to make sure that your pro­
vider can comply with these regulations.
	
✓	Loss of data: What provisions are in the contract if the provider does 
something to your data (loses it because of improper backup and recov­
ery procedures, for instance)? If the contract says that your monthly fee 
is simply waived, you need to ask some more questions.
	
✓	Business continuity plans: What happens if your cloud vendor’s data 
center goes down? What business continuity plans does your provider 
have in place: How long will it take the provider to get your data back up 
and running? For example, a SaaS vendor might tell you that they back 
up data every day, but it might take several days to get the backup onto 
systems in another facility. Does this meet your business imperatives?
	
✓	Uptime: Your provider might tell you that you will be able to access 
your data 99.999 percent of the time — however, read the contract. Does 
this uptime include scheduled maintenance?
	
✓	Data storage costs: Pay-as-you-go and no-capital-purchase options 
sound great, but read the fine print. For example, how much will it cost 
to move your data into the cloud? What about other hidden integra­
tion costs? How much will it cost to store your data? You should do 
your own calculations so you’re not caught off guard. Find out how the 
provider charges for data storage. Some providers offer a tiered pricing 
structure. Others offer pricing based on server capacity. 
	
✓	Contract termination: How will data be returned if the contract is ter­
minated? If you’re using a SaaS provider and it has created data for 
you too, will any of that get turned over to you? You need to ask your­
self if this is an issue. Some companies just want the data destroyed. 
Understand how your provider would destroy your data to make sure 
that it isn’t floating around in the cloud.
	
✓	Data ownership: Who owns your data after it goes into the cloud? Some 
service providers might want to take your data, merge it with other data, 
and do some analysis.
	
✓	Switching vendors: If you create applications with one cloud vendor 
and then decide to move to another vendor, how difficult will it be to 
move your data? In other words, how interoperable are the services? 
Some of these vendors may have proprietary APIs and it might be costly 
to switch. You need to know this before you enter into an agreement.

Discovering Private 
and Hybrid Clouds
In This Chapter
▶	Defining a private cloud
▶	Choosing between public, private, and hybrid cloud environments
▶	Investigating private cloud economics
▶	Looking at vendor solutions for private and hybrid
W
hile many business executives are attracted to the idea of the public 
cloud, just as many are interested in achieving the benefits of the 
cloud but on an internal basis. There are different reasons why companies 
investigating a cloud might want a private cloud instead of using a public 
one. The most obvious reason is privacy and security of data. Another reason 
that some companies are considering the private cloud is that they have 
already invested in a lot of hardware, software, and space and would like to 
be able to leverage their investments, but in a more efficient manner. 
What if you could avoid the security issue by keeping your data inside your 
firewall and still gain public cloud benefits? Then consider a private or a 
hybrid cloud. Many companies are looking at a situation where they actually 
see the benefits of using a public cloud for some services, a private cloud for 
others, a hybrid cloud for some situations, and their traditional data center 
for the rest. Indeed, the world of IT is complicated. We suspect that most 
organizations will have a combination of approaches — a hybrid of public 
and private clouds with traditional data centers included. 
In this chapter, we explain what a private cloud is and how it can work in 
tandem with public clouds. We explain the technology and services vendors 
are offering, and what happens when companies implement a strategy that 
combines a private cloud behind the firewall or a virtual private network with 
public cloud services.

Part II: Understanding the Nature of the Cloud 
Pining for Privacy
While it may be clear that a private cloud is private and a public cloud is 
open to anyone, there are nuances that help make the differences evident. 
Here are a few examples that might help:
	
✓	You’re a company selling a service to retailers that helps them manage 
their digital gift cards. You might use a public cloud service to enable 
the retailers to submit information to you, but you want to make sure 
that the data you’re collecting for them remains confidential and safe. 
You would, therefore, put that important data in a private cloud behind 
your company’s firewall.
	
✓	You’re a healthcare company in France. Your government requires that 
your patients’ data be stored within the country. You’d probably want 
to keep that data in a private cloud. 
	
✓	You’re a financial services company that has selected a sales manage­
ment system based on SaaS. However, you’re concerned about the 
security of your customer data. The SaaS company offers a private cloud 
version of its service by adding a virtual private network that adds a 
second layer of security.
Defining a private cloud
	
There’s confusion — as well as passionate debate — over the definition of a 
private cloud. When we say private cloud, we mean a highly virtualized cloud 
data center located inside your company’s firewall. It may also be a private 
space dedicated to your company within a cloud vendor data center designed 
to handle your company’s workloads. 
The characteristics of the private cloud are as follows:
	
✓	Allows IT to provision services and compute capability to internal users 
in a self-service manner 
	
✓	Automates management tasks and lets you bill business units for the 
services they consume 
	
✓	Provides a well-managed environment
	
✓	Optimizes the use of computing resources such as servers

89
 Chapter 9: Discovering Private and Hybrid Clouds
	
✓	Supports specific workloads
	
✓	Provides self-service based provisioning of hardware and software 
resources
	
You might think this sounds a lot like a public cloud! A private cloud exhibits 
the key characteristics of a public cloud, including elasticity, scalability, and 
self-service provisioning. (Please refer to Chapter 1 for detailed information on 
cloud characteristics.) The major difference is control over the environment. 
In a private cloud, you (or a trusted partner) control the service management. 
	
It might help to think of the public cloud as the Internet and the private cloud 
as the intranet.
If private and public clouds are so similar, why would you develop a private 
cloud instead of ordering capacity on demand from an Infrastructure as a 
Service provider or using Software as a Service? Here are several good rea­
sons companies are using a private rather than a public cloud:
	
✓	Your organization has a huge, well-run data center with a lot of spare 
capacity. It would be more expensive to use a public cloud even if you 
have to add new software to transform that data center into a cloud.
	
✓	Your organization offers IT services to a large ecosystem of partners as 
part of your core business. Therefore, a private cloud could be a rev­
enue source.
	
✓	Your company’s data is its lifeblood. You feel that to keep control you 
must keep your information behind your own firewall.
	
✓	You need to keep your data center running in accordance with rules of 
governance and compliance.
	
✓	You have critical performance requirements, meaning you need 99.9999 
percent availability. Therefore, a private cloud may be your only option. This 
higher level of service is more expensive, but is a business requirement.
	
Some early adopters of private cloud technology have experienced server use 
rates of up to 90 percent. This is a real breakthrough, particularly in challeng­
ing economic times. 
Comparing public, private, and hybrid
We wish we could tell you that there are clear distinctions between private 
and public clouds. Unfortunately, the lines are blurring between these two 
approaches. Hybrid approaches also are starting to take hold. For example, 

90
Part II: Understanding the Nature of the Cloud 
some public cloud companies are now offering private versions of their 
public clouds. Some companies that only offered private cloud technologies 
are now offering public versions of those same capabilities. 
In this section we offer some issues to consider when you’re making your 
business decision.
Going public
When is a public cloud the obvious choice? Here are some examples:
	
✓	Your standardized workload for applications is used by lots of people. 
Email is an excellent example.
	
✓	You need to test and develop application code.
	
✓	You have SaaS (Software as a Service) applications from a vendor who 
has a well-implemented security strategy.
	
✓	You need incremental capacity (to add compute capacity for peak 
times).
	
✓	You’re doing collaboration projects.
	
✓	You’re doing an ad-hoc software development project using a Platform 
as a Service (PaaS) offering.
	
Many IT department executives are concerned about public cloud security 
and reliability. You need to get security right and handle any legal and gover­
nance issues, or the short-term cost savings could turn into a long-term night­
mare. For more details on security, read Chapter 15; for more on governance, 
read Chapter 16. 
Keeping things private
	
In contrast, when would a private cloud be the obvious choice? Here are some 
examples:
	
✓	Your business is your data and your applications. Therefore, control 
and security are paramount.
	
✓	Your business is part of an industry that must conform to strict security 
and data privacy issues. A private cloud will meet those requirements. 
(See Chapter 16 for more on Governance). 
	
✓	Your company is large enough that you have the economies of scale to 
run a next generation cloud data center efficiently and effectively.

91
 Chapter 9: Discovering Private and Hybrid Clouds
Driving a hybrid
	
Now add one more choice into the mix: the hybrid cloud. When would you use 
it? It isn’t about making an either/or choice between a public or private cloud. 
In most situations, we think a hybrid environment will satisfy many business 
needs. Here are a few examples:
	
✓	Your company likes a SaaS application and wants to use it as a standard 
throughout the company; you’re concerned about security. To solve 
this problem, your SaaS vendor creates a private cloud just for your 
company inside their firewall. They provide you with a virtual private 
network (VPN) for additional security. Now you have both public and 
private cloud ingredients.
	
✓	Your company offers services that are tailored for different vertical mar­
kets. For example, you might offer to handle claims payments for insur­
ance agents, shipping services for manufacturers, or credit checking 
services for local banks. You may want to use a public cloud to create 
an online environment so each of your customers can send you requests 
and review their account status. However, you might want to keep the 
data that you manage for these customers within your own private 
cloud.
Amazon and Salesforce.com 
offer private cloud services
Just as we were finalizing this chapter, both 
Amazon (see Chapter 10 for more on Amazon’s 
offerings) and Salesforce.com (see Chapter 12 
for more on Salesforce.com’s SaaS platform) 
announced that they would be offering private 
cloud implementations of their public cloud-
based services. Both companies are using a 
VPN, which uses encryption to make the public 
network or a public cloud work as though it 
were private. 
Amazon has announced what it calls Amazon 
Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), which will 
provide customers with isolated AWS (Amazon 
Work Space) compute resources protected 
by VPN connections. Therefore, customers 
can use enhanced security features such as 
multi-factor authentication to protect data. See 
Chapter 15 for more on security in the cloud.
Salesforce.com is partnering with NTT to offer 
a VPN to customers that want additional secu­
rity for their CRM applications. Salesforce.com 
uses NTT’s Comm Network, which incorporates 
a VPN for enhanced security. 

92
Part II: Understanding the Nature of the Cloud 
	
Although private and public cloud environments each have management 
requirements by themselves, these requirements become much more com­
plex when you need to manage private, public, and traditional data centers all 
together. You need to add capabilities for federating (linking distributed 
resources) these environments. In addition, your service levels need to focus 
on how a service is working rather than how a server is working. 
Examining the Economics 
of the Private Cloud
	
There isn’t one right way to evaluate the economic benefits of public or 
private clouds. There may be some expenses in the public cloud that only 
become apparent after you’re already in your project. 
Before getting started, figure out which option is the most appropriate for 
	
✓	Your company’s information technology strategy 
	
✓	Your security strategy
	
✓	Your budgeting strategy
The economics of cloud computing are complicated. (For more details on the 
economics of the cloud, see Chapters 5, 6, and 21.)
Assessing capital expenditures 
What are your data center and IT operations actually costing you? It isn’t a 
simple question to answer. Most companies divide the area of expenses for 
IT into two buckets: 
	
✓	Capital expenditures are spent on buying equipment (servers, networks, 
storage systems). 
	
✓	Operating expenditures are the normal costs of operating a business day 
to day (salaries, system maintenance, and research and development). 
Sometimes management likes the idea of not paying for equipment or a soft­
ware package upfront. They may either want to pay in smaller, incremental 
payments. In this case, they might prefer a cloud platform. 

93
 Chapter 9: Discovering Private and Hybrid Clouds
	
✓	Example 1: You anticipate some big IT investment expenditures. Public 
cloud offerings may look economically very attractive (so you can avoid 
those purchases). 
	
✓	Example 2: Your very large company has an excess of IT resources. You 
may want to work with what you have and re-architect as modular ser­
vices. (For more on service orientation, see Chapter 19.) In addition, you 
might also want to add service management to support the automation 
of internal customers’ changing workloads. (For additional insight into 
service management and provisioning, take a look at Chapters 7 and 20.) 
Take a look at Chapters 10 through 12 to read how to assess the costs of dif­
ferent types of cloud models. 
Vendor private cloud offerings
Understanding what each vendor offers and how they compare can be 
confusing. 
Most of the technology vendors are still working on their cloud strategy as 
they firm up new products and develop partnerships. In fact, the competitive 
landscape for the private cloud market is a moving target at this point. 
	
One thing we can say with certainty is that the vendor offerings for private 
and hybrid clouds will have evolved between the time this book is written and 
its publication date. 
With that caveat, we have organized the vendors into three categories to give 
you a sense of how different types of companies are approaching the market.
Services-led technology
The services components (internal or partners) of these vendors have devel­
oped best practices over thousands of engagements and all this experience is 
brought to the forefront of each company’s cloud strategy. 
	
If your company lacks internal expertise on clouds and needs to implement 
a specialized set of solutions, a services-led engagement might be a good 
approach for you. In addition, a services company may have direct experience 
in your industry that may save you time.
The vendors in this category all have 
	
✓	Large customer bases 
	
✓	Years of experience working with customers on implementations 

94
Part II: Understanding the Nature of the Cloud 
	
✓	Service teams working with customers to answer the tough questions 
around security, governance, cost, and business objectives
	
✓	Enough size to develop a partner ecosystem to deliver on a comprehen­
sive vision for private, public, and hybrid clouds across services, soft­
ware, hardware, and storage
	
✓	A lot of their own sophisticated technology to use in private clouds 
(maybe servers, storage systems, service management software, service 
oriented architecture frameworks and services, security software, and 
middleware)
Systems integrators
Creating a cloud strategy is a complicated process. A cloud infrastructure 
needs a well-defined architecture or it can’t scale and won’t be manageable. 
	
Do you need lots of help with cloud strategy development and implementa­
tion, as well as integration services? Systems integrators handle those kinds of 
customers.
Many systems integrators 
	
✓	Have deep knowledge of data center creation 
	
✓	Partner closely with technology providers to create practices focused 
on private and hybrid cloud creation
	
✓	Have specialized knowledge in areas such as security and service 
orientation
Technology enablers
	
Just about any technology company that offers solutions for service-oriented 
architecture (SOA), service management, security, testing, storage, virtualiza­
tion, and network management (to name but a few) are revamping their offer­
ings so they can be sold for the cloud. Some cynics call this cloud washing. 
The reality is that cloud computing needs all these technologies.
Offering Up Key Vendors
We can’t cover all vendors, but in the next section we look at the private 
(and hybrid) cloud strategies and offerings of some of the key vendors in 
each category. This should get you started in understanding what’s available. 
The companies we include are IBM, HP, EMC, Unisys, Computer Sciences 
Corporation, Accenture, VMware, CA, Platform, Rackspace, 3Tera, and 
Eucalyptus.

95
 Chapter 9: Discovering Private and Hybrid Clouds
Services-led technology companies
All the following vendors are delivering private cloud offerings via an ecosys­
tem of partners. However, services companies’ offerings are based on their 
intellectual property. For example, IBM is focused on specialized software 
and best practices services, whereas EMC is focused on virtualization and 
the impact of the cloud on storage requirements. HP, on the other hand, is 
very focused on implementation services.
IBM
With many of its large enterprise customers determined to transform their data 
centers to become more efficient, IBM has already done a lot of private and 
hybrid cloud implementations. While the majority of IBM’s initial efforts have 
been directed toward packaging private and hybrid solutions for enterprise 
data centers, in the longer term we expect to see a much broader strategy that 
includes all aspects of the cloud, including public clouds for SaaS, IaaS, and 
PaaS. IBM has created a centralized cloud computing organization with a goal 
of creating offerings that encompass software, hardware, and services. 
IBM anticipates a lot of demand for solutions to manage the interface 
between public and private clouds. For example, IBM’s Blue Business plat­
form supports both public and private cloud interfaces. In this scenario, 
the customer has a physical box on-site in the data center. This way the 
customer can have a private cloud inside the firewall that also supports the 
ability to burst out into the public cloud when they need additional compute 
capacity or storage.
A key element of the IBM private and hybrid cloud strategy is to offer solu­
tions based on varying customer-driven workloads. These solutions are orga­
nized together as IBM Smart Business Cloud. IBM private and public cloud 
strategies offer solutions based on varying customer-centric workloads. 
These solutions are delivered via three consumption models: 
	
✓	Smart Business on the IBM Cloud (public cloud) is a set of standardized 
services delivered by IBM on the IBM cloud.
	
✓	Smart Business Cloud (private cloud) provides private cloud services, 
behind the client’s firewall, built and/or managed by IBM.
	
✓	Smart Business Systems (cloud in a box) are preintegrated, workload-
optimized systems for clients who want to build their own cloud with 
hardware and software. 

96
Part II: Understanding the Nature of the Cloud 
In addition, IBM has a packaged private cloud offering. IBM combines the 
hardware, software, storage, virtualization, networking, and service manage­
ment components in one package and adds options for services and financ­
ing. This package can include some preestablished connections to public 
cloud services.
As of August 2009, several categories of workload solutions are available for 
private cloud implementations, including the IBM Smart Analytics System. 
The following workloads are currently available: 
	
✓	Development and test: Many organizations have a lot of variation in 
the demand for test and development resources, making these types of 
workloads a very practical first step for companies looking to improve 
data center and IT efficiency and cost-effectiveness. This offering is a pri­
vate cloud implementation that provides customers with a self-service 
portal to develop and test on their own. This same service can be imple­
mented inside a customer’s firewall. IBM also has a public cloud offering 
for this area.
	
✓	Desktop and devices: End-user connections to desktops and mobile 
devices are another workload type that IBM has identified as a require­
ment for private clouds. Companies want their users to access appli­
cations from anywhere (at any time) by using thin clients or other 
Internet-connected devices. This cloud service provides the technology 
infrastructure for these user environments.
	
✓	Infrastructure storage: IBM is offering access to storage on demand in 
various ways. Customers can install the IBM Smart Business Storage 
Cloud behind the firewall in the data center. Customers can also buy 
hardware with the virtual image of hardware and software required 
for additional storage. IBM also has an option for customers to buy on-
demand storage on the IBM public cloud. 
	
✓	Infrastructure compute: This offering is IBM’s version of computing 
power on demand. This large enterprise offering has shared virtual 
images on the IBM cloud. IBM has partnered with Amazon and Google 
to add its middleware Software as a Service model in the Amazon and 
Google cloud environments. 
In keeping with its strategy of providing packaged solutions to help compa­
nies get up to speed quickly, IBM also offers its IBM Cloudburst appliance, a 
family of preintegrated hardware, storage, virtualization, and networking with 
built-in service management. 
Hewlett-Packard
HP has been working on cloudlike implementations with its customers since 
2001. These implementations have typically included consulting and integra­
tion support and have leveraged HP’s extensive collection of technology 
management products. 

97
 Chapter 9: Discovering Private and Hybrid Clouds
Based on experiences in these customer engagements, HP has put a special 
emphasis on helping customers who want to create hybrid cloud environ­
ments. The company is leveraging its extensive services teams (including the 
EDS division) to help educate and lead their customers down an appropriate 
path to the cloud. EDS has significant experience with vertical market-
managed services (hosted services specialized for different industries) and 
HP will leverage this knowledge and intellectual property (IP) in its evolving 
cloud strategy.
HP’s teams of business and IT consultants and engineers get involved with 
the design and implementation of many different types of cloud environ­
ments. For example, HP’s Infrastructure Design Service will help you design 
compute, storage, data center, and Infrastructure as a Service implementa­
tions. Other teams provide management consulting, business technology 
optimization, and testing services. 
While companies can easily incorporate a CRM software as a service imple­
mentation into its IT environment, large-scale adoption of cloud computing 
requires IT to adopt a services focus; HP is designing some of its consulting 
services with this in mind. In addition, HP has expanded its cloud environ­
ment consulting teams to help companies focus in on the quality of service 
delivered across all business lines.
HP is packaging its hardware for private cloud implementations. Two key 
examples: 
	
✓	Proliant SL, a scale-out server environment based on commodity servers
	
✓	Blade Matrix, a cloud in a box that includes the preintegration of net­
works, servers, storage, and automation capabilities
EMC
EMC has developed a shared vision for the private cloud along with its key 
partners like VMware, Cisco, and AT&T. This group sees lots of opportu­
nity in providing technology and services to companies looking for a better 
approach to managing IT infrastructure. 
And although some companies may use private clouds as an entry point and 
then transition to public clouds, EMC sees the private cloud as much more 
than just a staging ground for public clouds. EMC and partners want to help 
you create a flexible set of IT resources by federating your private clouds 
with external infrastructures provided by third-party providers.
Not surprisingly, EMC’s contribution is concentrated on providing storage, 
backup, archiving, and security (from RSA) to support the data centers in 
a private cloud environment. When all IT resources (servers, network, and 
storage) are pooled in the virtualized data center model, many things need to 
change. 

98
Part II: Understanding the Nature of the Cloud 
Storage must be designed and managed differently. For example, many EMC 
products require a dedicated pair of servers, and this requirement won’t fly 
in a virtualized environment. New tools and processes are required to plan 
and manage IT resources and ensure information security. For example, your 
company can use EMC’s Atmos cloud storage service to build a scalable 
internal storage cloud, and then tie it to an external cloud storage service. 
Cisco brings the network and capability of building a scalable network to the 
mix. VMware’s vSphere, as described later in this section, is the cloud operat­
ing system.
Systems integrators companies
There is no one answer to the best way to gain data center efficiency and 
leverage cloud benefits such as elasticity and self-service. Clouds don’t come 
in boxes, so you’ll need to work with providers and consultants. This is why 
companies like IBM and HP lead cloud service engagements with their own 
internal services teams. 
However, there’s a lot more work to go around, and companies like Unisys 
and CSC focus on security and governance. Other integrators, such as 
Accenture, are transforming their existing knowledge of managed services 
and hosting to provide cloud assistance to customers. 
	
Clearly, it’s early for the systems integrators. They will find techniques for par­
ticipating in this new market, but their service offerings are still emerging.
Unisys
Unisys, a veteran computing company, has focused its cloud strategy on 
security. Its primary offering is the Unisys Secure Cloud Solution, which is a 
hosted managed cloud service. Unisys intends to have a version of this avail­
able by the end of the year that it will call Cloud-in-a-box. The objective is to 
make it easier for you to create your own private cloud. The company also 
intends to offer a hybrid cloud service in 2010. This offering will enable you 
to have your own private cloud and combine that with hosted cloud services 
from Unisys.
Computer Sciences Corporation
Computer Sciences is focusing on IT security and reliability for its cloud 
strategy. While CSC has offered security services on a hosting basis, the 
company is now launching an Infrastructure as a Service version. CSC will 
try to differentiate itself by taking into account the physical location of a 

99
 Chapter 9: Discovering Private and Hybrid Clouds
company (because different countries have regulations regarding the move­
ment of data). A future service will help these companies securely connect to 
third-party clouds. CSC intends to build its services on top of Cisco’s Unified 
Computing System.
Accenture
Accenture offers what it calls its Cloud Computing Suite, which includes the 
following services: 
	
✓	Accenture Cloud Computing Accelerator 
	
✓	Accenture Cloud Opportunity Assessment Tool 
	
✓	Accenture Cloud Computing Data Processing Solution
Accenture is leveraging its experience with managed services and hosting to 
move into the cloud market. It also is partnering with many of the software 
and hardware providers (including EMC, Microsoft, and HP) to provide cloud 
solutions for its customers. 
Savvis, Inc.
Savvis is primarily an outsourced infrastructure service provider for enter­
prises. Over the past several years the company has begun providing private 
cloud solutions for its customers. The company is leveraging its 29 data cen­
ters to create cloud services, such as providing virtual lab services for devel­
opers and a platform for independent software vendors (ISVs) to offer their 
SaaS applications. In addition, the company is offering a hybrid cloud service 
so customers can establish a private cloud environment without one of the 
Savvis data centers. 
Technology enabler companies 
	
We put these companies together because their cloud offerings are focused 
on hardware and/or software technology and less on implementation services. 
For the most part, they have one or more of the key technology components 
required to build a cloud. 
However, as of August 2009, you can’t get all the technology you need 
to build a private cloud from any one of these vendors except Platform. 
Partnership relationships are understandably very important to these com­
panies to make sure that customers get the most value from the technology 
they provide.

100
Part II: Understanding the Nature of the Cloud 
VMware
VMware’s cloud strategy and technology road map is focused on private 
clouds and providing a way to bridge to external clouds through private 
clouds. With virtualization as the key underpinning technology enabling 
cloud infrastructures, VMware has identified three key building blocks for the 
private cloud: 
	
✓	The cloud operating system 
	
✓	Service level management 
	
✓	Federation and standards
The company can provide a portion of these requirements and relies on part­
ners for the remainder.
VMware provides the cloud operating system for private clouds through 
its software solution called vSphere. The company refers to this solution as 
a cloud operating system because it manages the data center infrastructure 
components (CPUs, storage, and networking), just as a computer operating 
system (like Linux or Windows) manages the components of a computer. 
vSphere has two main components: 
	
✓	Infrastructure services that transform server, storage, and network 
hardware into a shared resource 
	
✓	Application services that provide built-in service level controls
VMware’s acquisition of SpringSource (in August of 2009) lets the company 
fill in more of these private cloud building blocks with its own technology. 
SpringSource brings development tools and a management platform to 
the product mix, moving VMware toward a Platform as a Service offering. 
Partners like EMC and Cisco provide solutions for the additional critical com­
ponents of a private cloud. EMC brings storage, management, and security 
(from RSA) to the mix, while Cisco brings network and scalable network busi­
ness to the VMware cloud offering.
CA
CA is well positioned to help companies manage the mediation layer between 
private and public clouds. CA expects that your company will want to take 
advantage of public cloud services for a portion of your workload, but need 
to manage these public services into connection with private cloud imple­
mentations. 

101
 Chapter 9: Discovering Private and Hybrid Clouds
	
Your company will need a way to manage the combined services from public 
and private sources in order to take advantage of hybrid cloud services and 
deliver higher quality IT services at a lower cost. 
For example, if you’re using a lot of virtualized servers, you need a way to 
make sure that they’re operating efficiently. Also, you must make sure that 
you can treat internal and external resources as though they were an inte­
grated environment. This requires sophisticated service management. (For 
more on service management, see Chapter 20.)
CA’s strategy is to provide services that help you understand where specific 
workloads are running (public versus private cloud) and where they should 
be running for optimal performance and productivity gains. CA can help your 
company understand and manage the security and provision requirements 
between private and public cloud workloads. In addition, CA expects to offer 
its cloud services to service providers as well as directly to businesses, but 
doesn’t plan to be a provider of public clouds like Google or Amazon.
CA has a lot of infrastructure management software that can be applied to 
cloud environments. 
A number of CA’s products have been adapted to support VMware’s private 
cloud operating system, vSphere:
	
✓	Spectrum Infrastructure Manager 
	
✓	eHealth Performance Manager 
	
✓	Spectrum Automation Manager
The solutions all have a common focus: to help you manage private cloud 
environments with a unified information model and a single-user interface.
Platform Computing, Inc.
Platform Computing is an independent cloud management software company 
that is well known in the industry for its clusters and grids. With a strong 
background in high-performance computing, the company has developed all 
the components required for building a private cloud. Platform’s approach is 
to work with partners to help your company deliver IT as a service by imple­
menting private clouds. 
To deliver on this cloud strategy, Platform has developed a close relationship 
with an ecosystem of partners. Platform is already partnered with system man­
agement and virtualization vendors (such as HP, IBM, VMware, RedHat). Other 
partnerships, such as those with CA and BMC, are in the planning process.

102
Part II: Understanding the Nature of the Cloud 
The company’s offering for the cloud, Platform ISF, creates a shared comput­
ing infrastructure from physical and virtual resources. This shared infra­
structure delivers application environments according to specific policies 
that take into account the various workloads, available resources, and the 
relationship between them. Platform ISF helps you manage this workload 
across virtual and physical environments because it looks at the relation­
ship between workloads and resources. For example, because Platform ISF 
is aware of workload and resource usage, it can help balance resource use 
among different business units in your company.
Rackspace
Rackspace is an enterprise-hosting provider with the majority of its customer 
base in the cloud. The company has three core products that all deliver com­
puting as a service: 
	
✓	Rackspace Managed Hosting 
	
✓	Rackspace Cloud 
	
✓	Rackspace Email and Apps
Rackspace Cloud focuses on hosting Web sites for its customers. It provides 
storage space, bandwidth usage, and compute cycles. It also has a service for 
companies that want to gradually move their whole operation into the cloud.
The Rackspace private cloud offering enables your company to run the 
centrally managed VMware virtualization platform on private dedicated 
hardware environments in its own data center. It is designed with single-
tenant architecture because Rackspace feels that this approach will provide 
its customers with the level of control and security they demand from the 
cloud. Companies want control, but they don’t want to give up on the scal­
ability, flexibility, and resource optimization they can get from a public 
cloud. Rackspace’s customers are able to quickly provision virtualized server 
instances and use only what they need.
3Tera
3Tera’s AppLogic is a grid operating system (supporting platform) designed 
to support cloud computing. It supports middleware and Web applications 
under this operating system. Therefore, AppLogic is used by 3Tera partners 
to help virtualize software, which makes for easier management in a cloud 
environment. 
AppLogic works by allowing an application to be put into a “container” as 
though it were a business service. (See Chapter 19 for more on service ori­
entation.) In this way, an application designed for use on a traditional data 
center can act as though it were designed for the cloud. 

103
 Chapter 9: Discovering Private and Hybrid Clouds
In addition, 3Tera has announced a new offering called Cloudware that’s 
based on AppLogic but expands operating system support to Windows and 
Solaris. It also adds services to support a service catalog and other service 
management capabilities. Because it can virtualize traditional applications, it 
is used in many private cloud implementations. 
Eucalyptus
Eucalyptus Systems is an open-source software infrastructure for implement­
ing cloud computing on clusters — a group of computers linked together in a 
way that allows the group to work as one computer. (And just in case you’re 
wondering where the company got its name, it is the combination of the first 
letters from the phrase “Elastic Utility Computing Architecture for Linking 
Your Programs to Useful Systems”.) Companies use software from Eucalyptus 
to build private, public, or hybrid clouds.
You can use Eucalyptus software along with IT resources (servers, networks, 
storage) to form your own data center into a private cloud. Many companies 
building private clouds are concerned about the lack of standards in this 
emerging area. They don’t want to make a choice now that will lock them in 
to a specific vendor and make it hard to switch in the future. 
Eucalyptus provides an integrated set of application programming interfaces 
(APIs) that are compatible with Amazon Web Services, including Amazon’s 
Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), and 
Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS).
	
Eucalyptus Systems understands it needs to develop a large ecosystem of 
third-party software solutions to help increase demand for its private cloud 
platform. So far, Eucalyptus has partnered with some key cloud companies 
including AppScale, Canonical, CohesiveFT, Rightscale, rPath and Ylastic, pro­
viding solutions that extend the usability and accessibility of Eucalyptus. The 
company’s partnership with Canonical has led to some interesting develop­
ments with Ubuntu — a community based open-source Linux-based operating 
system for servers, laptops, and desktops). As we mention earlier in the chap­
ter, many companies begin looking at private clouds because they want to 
bring the public cloud qualities of elasticity and self-service inside the firewall. 
The Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud (which is powered by Eucalyptus) allows com­
panies using Amazon’s EC2 platform to extend these compute services for use 
in a private cloud.

I
n this chapter, we investigate Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) in a little 
more depth. 
	
IaaS is the delivery of computer hardware (servers, networking technology, 
storage, and data center space) as a service. You also can expect it to include 
the delivery of operating systems and virtualization technology to manage the 
resources. The IaaS customers rent computing resources instead of buying 
and installing them in their own data center.
Tracing IaaS to ISP 
Most commentators place the dawn of IaaS when Amazon launched its 
Electric Cloud Computing (EC2) service in 2006. Amazon’s move into the 
market was definitely a step forward. But long before then, Internet service 
providers (ISPs) were happily renting out servers to companies.
	
Why are we talking about ISPs in terms of IaaS? If you look at the ISP business 
model and technology infrastructure, you see a lot of similarities to the IaaS 
model. In fact, if you compare what customers get from an ISP to what they get 
from an IaaS vendor, you see that it’s pretty much the same capability. Both 
rent infrastructure for the purpose of running applications. 

108
Part III: Examining the Cloud Elements 
Therefore, the good news is that infrastructure as a service is actually the 
maturation of the ISP model. The key difference is the addition of new tech­
nologies such as virtualization and well-defined self-service management 
interfaces. 
Renting (but not to own)
Why do companies rent external infrastructure to run their Web sites? All 
reasons are related to four motivations: 
	
✓	Price
	
✓	Aggregation of resources
	
✓	Speed to deployment 
	
✓	Security
	
ISPs are particularly useful for small companies that want to set up a Web site 
that won’t attract a large amount of traffic. But ISPs are also capable of run­
ning large Web sites. In most cases, organizations choose to run their own 
Web sites only when traffic becomes very heavy.
Taking price beyond hardware 
At the time of this writing, you can rent a Quad Core Xeon server running 
at 2.4 GHz with 8GB of memory and 250GB of disk space for about $300 per 
month. That’s $3,600 per year. A server of this kind doesn’t cost a great deal 
(say $2,000–$3,000), but if you’re going to use it as a Web server, the cost of 
ownership will most likely be significantly more than $3,600 per year when 
you take into account the networking, Internet connections, server manage­
ment, and everything else the ISP provides.
Managing traffic 
The ISP not only aggregates server resources but also networking resources, 
disk space, and bandwidth. Consequently, the ISP customer no longer needs 
to be concerned about these resources as long as the contract indicates 
adequate resources to handle spikes in demand. This can be a particular con­
cern for Web sites, which are sometimes subjected to flash floods of traffic; 
an ISP may not be prepared to scale on demand to meet additional demand 
for network bandwidth and computer capacity.
Deploying quickly 
The ISP and its successor in the IaaS market typically allocate resources 
from a pool and therefore it’s usually fast to make new resources available. 
Normally, when you buy a service or more capacity, it’s available almost 
instantly (within hours). Because these providers aggregate homogeneous 
resources across large numbers of customers, it can normally make new 

109
 Chapter 10: Seeing Infrastructure as a Service
resources available faster than the typical data center can. This includes pro­
viding a ready-to-run server (or virtual server) that is normally created from 
a standard software image suitable for a Web server.
Security is variable depending on provider
Service providers may vary in the actual level of security they provide. 
However, they will know about Internet security, and larger ISPs may be 
prepared for and able to deal with Internet-specific threats such as denial of 
service attacks.
Following the ISP pattern
Much of the IaaS market will likely follow in the path of the ISP market. The 
ISP model has been proven and some large ISPs (GoDaddy at www.godaddy.
com and inMotion Hosting at www.inmotionhosting.com) run millions of 
Web sites.
	
The ISP service is typically paid for based on the amount of resources used 
over time. This can include dynamic scaling so that if more resources are 
required than expected, they will be provided immediately (up to a given 
limit). The arrangement involves an agreed-upon service level — normally 
99.9 percent availability or better, with limits set on CPU usage, memory, disk 
space, and Internet bandwidth.
	
No one will object if you want to rent a server or a virtual server from an ISP 
and you run a data mart (instead of running a Web site). Nothing in the cus­
tomer agreement stops you from using the resources in that way. It wouldn’t 
make much sense, however, because you probably wouldn’t get the service 
level agreement you wanted or the support you needed. 
IaaS takes the ISP model to a new level. If your infrastructure (including 
computer hardware, operating systems, and virtualization technology) is 
delivered as a service, then you will expect the service delivery level to be 
synchronized with all the variations in your demand for those services. 
Exploring Amazon EC2: Case Study
Currently the highest profile IaaS operation is Amazon’s Elastic Compute 
Cloud, which is generally known as Amazon EC2. Ironically, Amazon didn’t 
start out to build a big infrastructure services business. Instead, the company 
built a massive infrastructure to support its retail business and discovered 
that it was underused. 

110
Part III: Examining the Cloud Elements 
It decided to leverage this asset while adding to the bottom line. A funny 
thing happened after this modest plan was put in place: Customers began to 
find that this could mushroom into something big. Fast-forward a few years: 
Today, Amazon has established itself as the guerrilla in the market. Amazon’s 
EC2 was launched in August 2006 and has evolved since then by adding dif­
ferent services and support for different operating systems.
What does Amazon offer today? Customers can rent computers or virtual 
instances to run their own computer applications. EC2 provides a Web ser­
vices interface through which a customer can create virtual machines and 
load and run any software. The customer has control of a virtual operating 
environment and so can create, launch, and terminate server instances as 
needed, which is why Amazon describes it as elastic. The customer can set 
up server instances in zones that are insulated from each other (regarding 
the failure of any component) and thus can set up a server instance that 
backs up another server instance.
EC2 Compute Units 
EC2 uses Xen virtualization to create and manage its virtual machines. (Xen 
is a popular, proven open-source hypervisor — a thin layer of software that 
allows other operating systems to run on the same system.) The Amazon ser­
vice allows the creation of virtual servers in one of three sizes: small, large, 
or extra large.
Currently Amazon sizes these instances by using EC2 Compute Units based 
on the approximate equivalent CPU capacity of physical hardware. One EC2 
Compute Unit equals a 1.0–1.2 GHz 2007 AMD Opteron or 2007 Intel Xeon pro­
cessor. Using that as a basis, Table 10-1 shows the allocations of resources. 
The first three table entries are the common instances that EC2 offers. 
Amazon also provides two other alternatives for compute-intensive applica­
tions, which it refers to as High-CPU Instances. Those are the last two entries.
Platforms and storage
Amazon EC2 supports the following operating systems:
	
✓	Linux 
	
✓	Sun Microsystems’ OpenSolaris and Solaris Express Community Edition 
	
✓	Microsoft’s Windows Server 2003
This covers most of the common operating systems that companies might 
want to use, other than those from IBM and Hewlett-Packard, both of which 
provide their own cloud services (both alone and through partnerships).

111
 Chapter 10: Seeing Infrastructure as a Service
The storage offered with the various instances persists only as long as the 
instance is in use. Amazon also provides persistent storage for those who 
want it, in the form of Elastic Block Storage (EBS). Users can set up and 
manage storage volumes of anything from 1GB to 1TB (terabyte). You can 
connect these EBSs to servers, so the data is attached to the server instance 
while it exists.
	
Storage needs can also be met by Amazon’s Simple Storage Service (S3), which 
is available independently to EC2 because its goal is simply to provide storage 
space that is accessible via the Internet at any time. With S3, storage items 
(called objects) can be any size from 1 byte to 5 gigabytes, and there’s no limit 
of the number of items that can be stored. Each object is stored in a “bucket” 
and retrieved via a unique, user-assigned key. Full authentication security is 
provided.

Part III: Examining the Cloud Elements 
EC2 pricing
Amazon’s primary charges are of two types:
	
✓	Hourly charge per virtual machine
	
✓	Data transfer charge
	
Amazon’s EC2 hourly charges are counted from the moment a virtual machine 
is created to the time it’s taken down (rounding up to the next hour). The 
charge applies whether the resources are fully used or lying idle.
The data transfer charges are for data in and out, not for data retained. There 
are increased rates for running Windows and some small charges for data 
transfer between instances.
If you compare resource for resource, the ISP offering of a Quad Core Xeon 
server running at 2.4 GHz with 8 gigabytes of memory and 250GB of disk 
space for about $300 per month is clearly a better deal than Amazon offers, 
but that tells you that the Amazon’s IaaS business has a completely different 
character than an ISP business. Amazon sells by the hour and ISPs don’t — 
that’s the major difference.
EC2 customers
Many activities that occur in a data center are temporary. Consider these 
examples:
	
✓	End-of-month and end-of-year workloads
	
✓	Ad-hoc workloads (such as creating a temporary data mart to analyze a 
data set)
	
✓	System testing
	
You either cater for these workloads by putting something permanent in 
place, or you have to commission resources for them. It’s really unlikely that 
your data center has the ability to set up and take down virtual servers under 
user control.
That’s what Amazon provides. If you make efficient use of the capability, it’s 
likely to be less expensive than trying to achieve something similar in your 
own data center. Amazon provides the capability to remove some of the peak 
demands on the data center. For most companies that’s a win all the way 
around: for the systems users, for developers for operational staff, and for 
the company itself in terms of cost and service levels.

113
 Chapter 10: Seeing Infrastructure as a Service
Checking Out Other IaaS Companies
We spend a good deal of time in this chapter describing Amazon’s EC2 
because it’s the best known of the IaaS operations. However, it’s by no 
means the only one. Companies that have entered the IaaS market include 
Rackspace Cloud, GoGrid, MediaTemple, GridLayer, Flexiscale, and Joyent. 
All of these, like Amazon, offer a pay-per-use arrangement, with the prices, 
capabilities, and terms of usage varying.
The services they provide are similar to EC2 as well in that they provide 
access to a resource pool and enable the configuration of virtual servers and 
the installation of platform software and Web server software in a simple 
way. Their approaches vary. 
These companies (and others not mentioned) will inevitably be joined by 
major IT companies such as IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Cisco, EMC, Microsoft, 
Oracle, CSC, and Accenture, all of whom are strategizing and some of whom 
are building data centers and preparing to enter the market.
Rackspace 
Rackspace Cloud, a spinoff from Rackspace, for example, entered the market 
in 2005 before Amazon did and offers a service that is much closer to an ISP 
service than Amazon’s.
It focuses primarily on attracting customers that want to host Web sites and 
its charges are more oriented to Web site usage. It charges for
	
✓	Storage space
	
✓	Bandwidth usage
	
✓	Compute cycles (which constitute its own measure of CPU and memory 
usage)
However, it also offers “instant servers” that can be bought on an hourly 
basis with prices based on memory used and instant storage.
This service is for companies that might want to gradually move their whole 
operation into the cloud (assuming that all their software can run on com­
modity servers — no-frills servers designed for basic workloads or servers 
grouped in clusters to provide lots of computing power through virtualiza­
tion). Refer to Chapter 6 for more information.

114
Part III: Examining the Cloud Elements 
GoGrid 
GoGrid has similar pricing to Rackspace, charging for
	
✓	Storage space (more than 10GB)
	
✓	Outbound data transfer
	
✓	Server RAM hours (with different prices for different combinations of 
memory and CPU)
GoGrid emphasizes ease of use and offers a greater level of technical control 
(including load balancing) than either the Amazon EC2 or Rackspace cloud.
Others
Many other companies are entering the IaaS market. Here are a few:
	
✓	MediaTemple is a highly successful ISP that’s turning its hand to IaaS, 
but continuing with ISP-type pricing.
	
✓	Gridlayer is a grid computing company that has more than 12,000 servers 
deployed. It offers virtual private servers, storage, and virtual private data 
centers. The virtual private data center is what it sounds like — a collec­
tion of server resources that can be configured according to need.
	
✓	Flexiscale is like most of the IaaS companies already described, 
although it distinguishes itself by providing an API to its environmental 
software (which most companies don’t). It also provides a virtual LAN 
(VLAN) to each customer. It claims to be significantly less expensive 
than Amazon EC2, although it’s clear from the pricing that other IaaS 
companies may come in less expensive than Amazon EC2, depending on 
your needs.
	
✓	Joyent Accelerator is an ISP that has moved into the IaaS market and its 
pricing (based on a monthly fee for specific levels of hardware) reflects 
that. Its Zeus Accelerator is a virtual appliance that manages Web appli­
cations to guarantee performance. Joyent also has specific expertise in 
most Web platforms, including Ruby on Rails.
Examining IaaS-Enabling Technology
	
The ability to offer IaaS requires software that can manage the infrastructure 
that’s being shared. In this area, two technologies are worth drawing attention to:

115
 Chapter 10: Seeing Infrastructure as a Service
	
✓	AppLogic from 3Tera
	
✓	Eucalyptus, an open source initiative
AppLogic
3Tera, Inc., was founded in 2004 to develop system software for utility com­
puting and cloud computing. In February 2006, it launched its AppLogic 
product, which has since been taken up by many service providers and cloud 
computing vendors. 
	
You can think of AppLogic as management software that converts arrays of 
servers into virtualized resource pools that can be shared among multiple 
users.
The software enables users to create and retire virtual machines but also to 
define necessary infrastructure such as firewalls, VPNs, load balancers, and 
storage by using a browser interface. AppLogic enables the configuration of
	
✓	Virtual private servers
	
✓	Virtual private data centers (involving complex configuration of applica­
tion infrastructure)
	
✓	Cloud data storage
	
✓	Software as a Service (SaaS) applications
AppLogic is sold either on a usage basis or by software license, so it can be 
used in house for private clouds. The product has been so successful among 
service providers that it enables hybrid situations where a customer uses 
more than one provider. It’s also useful in migrating from a private cloud to a 
public cloud.
Eucalyptus
Eucalyptus is a rather forced acronym standing for Elastic Utility Computing 
Architecture for Linking Your Programs To Useful Systems. Unfortunately the 
name doesn’t give a reasonable description of what the software does.
Eucalyptus is a system for implementing on-premise private and hybrid 
clouds, using the hardware and software infrastructure that’s in place, with­
out modification. In effect, it’s an add-on capability for data center virtual­
ization to create genuine cloud capability such as self-service provisioning, 
security, performance management, and end-user customization.

116
Part III: Examining the Cloud Elements 
Eucalyptus is open source, so the software can be downloaded free and it is 
also shipped with the Ubuntu 9.04 (and later) distribution of Linux. It is thus 
becoming the default open-source cloud capability. It is implemented by 
using commonly available Linux tools and basic Web service technologies. 
The current interface to Eucalyptus is compatible with Amazon’s EC2, S3, and 
Elastic Block Store (EBS) — a storage area network (SAN) in the cloud — inter­
faces, so it is possible to create a private cloud by using Eucalyptus with the 
intention of moving some or all of it onto EC2.
Trusting the Cloud
A significant amount of nervousness surrounds the prospect of using cloud 
services. Part of this can be chalked up to unfamiliarity with using cloud-
based capability, but some of it is goes much deeper than that.
CSC, the global systems integration company, was quick to recognize this issue 
and first used the term trusted cloud to define the kind of environment that 
many organizations would want and expect from a cloud service provider. 
	
The trusted cloud includes services that are
	
✓	Secure
	
✓	Transparent of control and result (whether it provides a full customer 
interface so that you can see how everything functions)
	
✓	Able to provide evidence that systems operate as advertised (whether it 
definitely meets the services levels it is supposed to be providing)
An organization might have many concerns in moving systems into an IaaS 
environment, but these are the primary ones.
Although companies clearly trust their Web sites to cloud providers, they’re 
much less likely to trust their mission-critical systems to the cloud. Secure 
cloud data centers exist. In a way, this type of trusted cloud is similar to what 
outsourcing specialists and managed service providers offer (plus a cloud 
customer interface that puts the customer directly in control).
	
We discuss cloud standards in Chapter 14, and clearly standards will emerge 
in time so customers can select cloud services without making significant 
technical changes to either software or data. At the moment, however, no 
established standards exist, so those organizations moving systems into the 
cloud need to be concerned not just about the preceding points, but also 
about overall control of their systems.

117
 Chapter 10: Seeing Infrastructure as a Service
	
The IaaS customer needs to be able to integrate all systems and software run­
ning in the cloud with other corporate systems and manage the whole as a 
single unit. This kind of orchestration of systems is a new challenge in many 
areas, particularly in managing performance and managing security in a coher­
ent way.
What Infrastructure as a 
Service Means to You
More and more companies are looking to defray costs and gain flexibility by 
leveraging infrastructure that can be used on demand. What does this mean 
to you? 
	
✓	Think about how you’re getting your services.
	
✓	Understand which services include a set of well-defined interfaces and 
which ones will lock you in to a complex set of services that will be dif­
ficult to move away from. 
	
✓	Know why you’re using a cloud service. For example, if you need some 
temporary capacity to test a new application, your requirements will be 
very different than if you’re creating an application that will operate in a 
cloud. 
In addition to understanding potential cloud gains, get familiar with how your 
infrastructure service provider handles the following capabilities: 
	
✓	Explicitly defines service level agreements for availability, support, and 
performance (of provisioning more resource)
	
✓	A utility computing billing arrangement, relating cost to actual resource 
usage in a measured way
	
✓	A virtualization environment that enables the configuration of systems 
(for compute power, bandwidth, and storage) as well as the creation 
individual virtual machines (all to be available on an ad-hoc basis)
	
✓	A flexible, extensible, resource-rich environment that’s engineered for 
secure multi-tenancy (multiple users or tenants running the software in a 
shared environment on its servers)
	
✓	Internet connectivity, including a Web services interface to the custom­
er’s management environment

Chapter 11
Exploring Platform as a Service
In This Chapter
▶	Examining integrated lifecycle platform as a service
▶	Exploring anchored lifecycle platform as a service
▶	Enabling platforms as a service
T
here are many ways to approach cloud computing, depending on what 
business problem you’re trying to solve. When organizations are looking 
for capacity on demand, they often look to Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). 
However, when an organization is looking for a deeper set of capabilities, 
they look at Platform as a Service (PaaS). 
Of course, like everything in life, there are shades of gray. In fact, many com­
panies that fit into the IaaS category offer platform services as well. But to 
keep things a little simpler, we focus on the technologies and companies that 
provide infrastructure and various development and deployment services for 
the cloud. 
	
Although PaaS has many definitions, we’d like you to think about it as a com­
puting platform that includes a set of development, middleware, and deploy­
ment capabilities. A key vendor characteristic is creating and encouraging a 
deep ecosystem of partners who all commit to this environment for the future. 
In this chapter, we discuss what types of services are included in a Platform 
as a Service, the variety of approaches, and the considerations that you 
should take into account. We provide examples of several key platforms 
emerging on the PaaS market.

120
Part III: Examining the Cloud Elements 
Putting Platform as a Service 
on a Pedestal
There isn’t only one approach to PaaS. In fact, the lines between Platform as 
a Service and Infrastructure as a Service can blur as well. But for purposes of 
getting your head around platforms that help you develop applications in the 
cloud, we separated Infrastructure as a Service. (See Chapter 10 for more on 
it.) Platform as a Service has many characteristics worth mentioning. 
Consider what all PaaS solutions have in common:
	
✓	PaaS has to leverage the Internet.
	
✓	PaaS must offer some type of development language so professional 
developers (and in some cases users) can add value.
	
✓	These environments need a way to monitor and measure resource use 
and to track overall performance of the vendor’s platform.
	
✓	Almost all PaaS platforms are based on a multi-tenancy architecture 
(which lets multiple clients run their copy separately from each other 
through virtualization) so that each customer’s code or data is isolated 
from others. See Chapter 12 for more on multi-tenancy.
	
✓	A PaaS environment needs to support the development lifecycle and the 
team development process, including testing.
	
✓	A PaaS platform needs to include services interfaces such as SOAP 
(Simple Object Access Protocol) and XML (eXtensible Markup 
Language), among others.
	
✓	A PaaS platform must be able to deploy, manage, test, and maintain the 
developed applications.
	
✓	A PaaS platform must support well-defined and well-documented inter­
faces so elements and components can be used in the following:
 
• Composite applications are created by combining services to create 
an enterprise application based on orchestration of business logic 
and rules. 
 
• Portals, which are an organized environment that organizes 
application components for the customer.
 
• Mashups, which let end users easily bring together two or 
more business services that can communicate and exchange 
data.

121
 Chapter 11: Exploring Platform as a Service
	
Although PaaS platforms have some common characteristics, we think there 
are some different approaches that are appropriate for different needs. We 
have divided the environments into three categories:
	
✓	Integrated lifecycle platform
	
✓	Anchored lifecycle platform
	
✓	Enabling technologies as a platform
Integrated lifecycle platforms
Several emerging key platforms provide the developer with a full environ­
ment for creating an application without buying any individual tools. For 
example, the platform provider will provide the developer with a full stack 
including an operating system, a programming language, security, storage, 
version control, collaborative tools, as well as tools to build Web interaction. 
These integrated PaaS companies often include the following:
	
✓	A workflow engine
	
✓	Development tools
	
✓	A testing environment
	
✓	An ability to integrate databases
	
✓	Third-party tools and services
These platforms provide services as a well-integrated and well-tuned stack 
with its own middleware and often its own programming interfaces. 
Two prominent examples of integrated lifecycle platforms are Google App 
Engine and Microsoft’s Azure, which we discuss in the section “Getting Inside 
the Integrated Lifecycle Platform,” later in this chapter. 
NIST PaaS
The National Institute of Standards and Technology 
(NIST), a U.S. federal government agency estab­
lished to design technology standards, has come 
up with one definition of PaaS worth noting: 
“Platform as a Service is the ability to provide a 
computing environment and the related develop­
ment and deployment stack needed to deliver a 
solution to the consuming customer.”

122
Part III: Examining the Cloud Elements 
Anchored lifecycle platforms
	
Although anchored platforms have most of the same characteristics as the 
integrated lifecycle platform, there is one key difference: These environments 
have a packaged business software at the core. 
The most prominent example of an anchored platform is Salesforce.com and 
its Force.com platform. Likewise, Intuit is leveraging its QuickBooks financial 
software environment to create an anchored platform.
Enabling technologies as a platform
	
Not all platforms in the cloud include a full lifecycle environment. Some plat­
forms are focused on providing specialized capabilities. Some of these capa­
bilities may be a specific tool. 
For example, although Amazon.com provides a comprehensive IaaS platform, 
it also offers platform tools such as SimpleDB and Simple Query Service 
(SQS). Other enabling technology environments (such as Rightscale) provide 
an integrated management platform designed for the cloud. Hyperic, a divi­
sion of Springsource (recently acquired by VMWare), offers a cloud-based 
monitoring environment. WaveMaker lets users customize their platform and 
allows developers to reuse existing code within the PaaS environment. There 
are testing-based and social networking-based services as well.
The following sections in this chapter take a closer look at these three types 
of PaaS. To do this, we look at some of the key vendors that provide these 
capabilities. Clearly, there are many other players besides the ones we list 
here, and there will be even more before this book is even published. Our 
goal is to give you an understanding of how each of these PaaS approaches 
works.
Getting Inside the Integrated 
Lifecycle Platform
To really get a good understanding of what it means to have a lifecycle plat­
form as a service, we thought it would be helpful to give you an in-depth look 
at two of the most important PaaS vendors: Google with its App Engine and 
Microsoft with its Azure platform.

✓	Google App Engine exposes a fully integrated development environment.
	
✓	It’s easy to scale.
	
✓	It’s free to get started.
That really sums up Google’s strategy for PaaS. Google isn’t trying to help 
customers create every application to run on every platform. It is actually 
quite focused, helping customers build Web-based applications. The platform 
is for development and deployment. 
	
In essence, the developer provides the Google App Engine with a URL (Web 
address) for the application it’s building and the engine maps that code to 
Google’s development platform. The App Engine handles the Web application 
lifecycle, including routine tasks such as request logs, checking the applica­
tion status, updating the application version, operating the underlying data­
base, and handling workflow.
Google has integrated all the development tools into a single integrated envi­
ronment. When customers tie their development into the lifecycle environ­
ment provided by Google, they also gain access to Google’s IaaS. In this way, 
customers can add more capacity on demand. 
Other Google infrastructure services 
In addition to development services, Google also provides other integrated 
platform services, including but not limited to the following: 
	
✓	Google Accounts for authentication 
	
✓	Google native file system called GFS (Google File System) 
	
✓	BigTable platform (for data management), a distributed storage system 
that manages very large-scale structured data 
It also includes infrastructure services such as 
	
✓	Load balancing
	
✓	Persistent storage with queries
	
✓	Sorting and transactions

124
Part III: Examining the Cloud Elements 
	
✓	Programming interfaces to support authenticating users and sending 
email by using Google Accounts 
	
✓	Scheduled tasks for triggering events at specified times and regular 
intervals
This is essentially the same platform that Google uses to build its own 
software.
Google development stack 
In addition to these infrastructure tools, Google App Engine also includes a 
development stack. Google calls this a scalable serving infrastructure that con­
nects the Web application code to the Google environment. 
It does this by integrating with the following tools:
	
✓	Python runtime: To create an application for the platform requires a 
programming language. The first one that Google supported was Python, 
a high-level programming language that makes it easier to rapidly build 
complex applications with minimal programming. Python includes 
models and packages and supports code reuse. 
	
✓	Java runtime: Google added Java as a second supported programming 
language platform. This runtime is integrated with Google’s toolkits and 
is intended to be used for AJAX (asynchronous JavaScript and XML) or 
interactive Web applications. 
	
✓	A Software Development Kit (SDK): This set of development tools 
enables developers to write application code. 
	
✓	A Web-based administration console: The console helps developers 
manage their applications.
	
✓	Datastore: A datastore is a software layer that stores a Web application’s 
data. It is built on the Bigtable (a high-performance database) structure. 
(For more details on data in the cloud, see Chapter 8).
Google fees
Google has set up Google App Engine to encourage its wide adoption. As 
with other cloud platforms, customers pay based on usage, so there’s no 
set-up cost or other maintenance fees. For example, there is no charge for a 
developer to build an application. After a customer deploys that application, 
however, the charges begin to add up. The customer pays for storage and 
bandwidth. Each of these applications can use up to 500MB of storage, up 
to 5 million page views each month without an additional fee. A customer is 
allowed to register up to ten applications per developer account.

125
 Chapter 11: Exploring Platform as a Service
When developers create an application, they’re granted a quota of resources 
that they can use without paying anything. This includes 6.5 hours of CPU 
time per day and 1 gigabyte of data transferred in and out of the application 
per day.
When additional resources are required, costs are as follows:
	
✓	$0.10–$0.12 per CPU core-hour
	
✓	$0.15– $0.18 per GB per month of storage
	
✓	$0.11– $0.13 per GB outgoing bandwidth
	
✓	$0.09– $0.11 per GB incoming bandwidth
	
✓	$0.15 per GB per month for stored data
	
✓	$0.0001 per recipients emailed
Microsoft Azure
Microsoft, the incumbent in the application development and deployment 
market, has taken its .Net platform into the cloud. Azure is Microsoft’s PaaS 
strategy that was announced in 2008. Microsoft defines the Azure platform as 
“an Internet-scale cloud services platform hosted in Microsoft data centers, 
which provides an operating system and a set of developer services that can 
be used individually or together.” 
Microsoft’s overall strategy is a combination of on-premise computing 
with cloud-based services. The idea is that developers want to build some 
applications that live on-site, while other components will live in the cloud. 
Microsoft calls this strategy software plus services. The heart of Microsoft’s 
strategy is to allow developers to use the same underlying technology and 
enablers to build both on-premise applications and cloud applications. 
While the main focus of the Azure platform is to bring Microsoft’s familiar 
programming model to the cloud, Microsoft also intends to support other 
programming models, including Ruby on Rails and Python. For interoper­
ability, Microsoft supports various Internet protocols, including HTTP, REST, 
SOAP, and XML.
Azure platform 
The Azure platform is composed of four different components:
	
✓	Windows Azure: This Windows environment runs applications locally 
and stores the related data on servers inside the Microsoft data center.

126
Part III: Examining the Cloud Elements 
	
✓	Microsoft .NET Services: These are the same .Net services that 
Microsoft has in its Windows environment. It has been extended to sup­
port cloud-based as well as on-premise applications.
	
✓	Microsoft SQL Services: These are the same data services Microsoft 
offers on premise that have been extended to the cloud. However, if you 
want to take advantage of Azure’s scaling capability, you must rewrite 
the SQL code. The goal of SQL services is to provide an asset of cloud-
based approaches for storing the data in the cloud. The data services 
expose both SOAP and REST interfaces as data access methods. For data 
storage, Azure doesn’t use a relational model.
	
✓	Live Services: This set of services allows developers to connect code 
developed in the Windows Live platform into the cloud. These services 
include a framework intended to integrate, connect, and synchronize 
code. The platform also includes support for different programming lan­
guages and allows all resources to include a URL address.
When you put the pieces together, Microsoft has created a platform that 
allows developers to use familiar tools such as Microsoft’s Visual Studio and 
.Net services and then store the data in a Microsoft-owned cloud platform. 
Therefore, developers familiar with building .Net applications will be com­
fortable with Microsoft’s cloud approach.
Like Google, Microsoft has a pay-as-you-go consumption model for its PaaS 
offering. And like Google, Microsoft doesn’t charge for development and test­
ing phases. It begins charging customers when the applications are deployed. 
Azure fees
The following is a list of the pricing Microsoft has released:
Windows Azure:
	
✓	Compute at $0.12 per hour
	
✓	Storage at $0.15 per GB stored
	
✓	Storage transactions at $0.01 per 10K
SQL Azure:
	
✓	Web Edition: Up to 1GB relational database at $9.99
	
✓	Business Edition: Up to 10GB relational database at $99.99
.NET Services:
	
✓	Messages at $0.15 per 100K message operations (including Service Bus 
messages and Access Control tokens)
	
✓	Bandwidth across all three services will be charged at $0.10 in and $0.15 
out per GB

 Chapter 11: Exploring Platform as a Service
Getting Inside Anchored Lifecycle 
Platform as a Service
	
Why did we distinguish between integrated lifecycle platforms and anchored 
lifecycle platforms? It is simple, really. Anchored platform as a service is a 
business application-centric approach to development in the cloud. Therefore, 
anchored Platform as a Service vendors started out in life as Software as a 
Service vendors, for the most part. 
Because of their heritage, vendors in this space have several characteristics 
in common: 
	
✓	A large customer base
	
✓	Defined services such as billing
	
✓	Security and authentication
	
✓	Programming languages 
	
✓	Integration services 
These services are the same ones the company used to create its own SaaS 
offerings.
In the next section, we focus on two of the anchored Platform as a Service 
vendors and how they structure their offerings.
Salesforce.com’s Force.com platform
Salesforce.com initiated a platform called Force.com as its foray into the 
cloud platform market. It helps commercial software developers create 
cloud-based applications based on Salesforce.com’s development environ­
ment. In addition, applications built with Force.com’s tools can also take 
advantage of the CRM applications. 
At the heart of this platform is the multi-tenancy architecture. This means that 
applications designed with Force.com assume that users will share a single 
physical instance. However, those instances and the application code built in 
those instances are isolated from each other. In addition, this type of multi-
tenancy also means that customizations designed by one user will be isolated 
from customized designs built by any other user.

128
Part III: Examining the Cloud Elements 
Force.com platform 
The Force.com platform is centered around a development stack that 
includes the following components:
	
✓	Metadata architecture: Salesforce.com needed a metadata architecture 
to support its multi-tenancy approach. Salesforce.com considers this 
metadata stack as the core of its differentiation in the market. The meta­
data layer is complex and includes an application server called Resin. 
The Resin Application Server is a high-performance XML application 
server for use with Java server pages (JSPs), servlets, JavaBeans, XML, 
and a host of other technologies. 
	
	On top of this metadata layer is an authorization server. The metadata 
layer is structured so that each organization has unique access to the 
stack. Therefore, two companies could be physically connected to the 
same server but there would be no way for them to access each other’s 
data. The metadata layer will only point to the data that is specific to a 
user. The environment is designed so that each customer has a specific 
Web Service Description Language-based API. In fact, the architecture 
History.com on Salesforce.com 
We need to give credit to Salesforce.com for 
being the innovator in this space. A little history 
lesson will help put the anchored PaaS area into 
perspective. When Salesforce.com first came 
to market in 1999, the objective was to provide a 
packaged Customer Relationship Management 
(CRM) as a service. No matter how many cus­
tomers asked the company to provide them 
with an on-premise version of the product, the 
answer was always no. In the beginning, cus­
tomers were a little wary of having this upstart 
control their customer application. But after a 
couple of years, companies started to like what 
they saw. With this Software as a Service, plat­
form customers could have their cake and eat 
it too. They didn’t have to manage or update the 
application. Over time, Salesforce.com grew 
until it had thousands of customers and plenty 
of individual users.
Now here is when things changed. Instead of 
stopping with a nice, neat CRM application, 
Salesforce.com decided that it could leverage 
this platform and create a broader community 
of software vendors that might like to build their 
applications on top of their environment. The 
company therefore took its own programming 
environment that it had used to create its CRM 
application and made it available to third-party 
software developers. In this regard, anchored 
PaaS isn’t that much different than integrated 
PaaS. The difference is the ecosystem. When 
vendors began to write their applications to 
take advantage of Salesforce.com’s platform, 
they could now market and sell their software 
to the growing Salesforce.com customer base. 
That is the real difference between integrated 
lifecycle platform and an anchored platform. 
(For more details on Salesforce.com, see 
Chapter 12).

129
 Chapter 11: Exploring Platform as a Service
includes the approach of access APIs through the WSDL interface. There 
are two versions of WSDL: one general and one for a specific customer 
implementation. If a customer wants to share data, for example, they 
have to go through the general WSDL interface.
	
✓	Service delivery infrastructure: Salesforce.com’s cloud delivery infra­
structure is based on its managed and secure data center environment. 
This is the same infrastructure used to manage its CRM customers.
	
✓	Database as a service: The database is built on top of the metadata ser­
vices. The data services provide data security by enabling customers to 
declare validation rules (such as confirming that an account number is 
valid). It enables customers to build customized objects and fields. The 
customer isn’t responsible for database tuning, backup, or upgrades, 
because of the cloud infrastructure.
	
✓	Integration as a service: At the center of Force.com’s integration capa­
bilities is a Web services Application Programming Interface (API). This 
API allows customers to access data stored in a Force.com application 
because it supports industry-standard SOAP Web services. Salesforce.
com partners use this API to create connectors to packaged applications 
such as SAP R/3 and Oracle Financials. In addition, there are prebuilt 
integrations to services such as Amazon’s Web services, Facebook, and 
Google App Engine. Force.com also supports Web services standards 
including Java, .NET, PhP, and Perl.
	
✓	Logic as a service: This is a set of automated workflow services. A 
built-in workflow engine includes services such as task creation, record 
assignment, and other event-triggered services. Customers can use a 
Salesforce.com programming language (called Apex) as a way to extend 
the application by writing new code.
	
✓	User interface as a service: Force.com provides two ways of building or 
customizing user interfaces: 
 
• A builder to change the application layout and Visualforce
 
• A framework for building user interfaces for both private and 
public clouds
	
	Developers can use standard Web development tools including HTML, 
AJAX, and Adobe Flex.
	
✓	Development as a service: Development tools include the Metadata API, 
an IDE (Integrated Development Environment), a development sandbox 
(a separate development space for developers), and a service called 
Code Share for building cloud-based applications.
	
✓	AppExchange marketplace: This site enables vendors that have used 
the Salesforce.com interfaces. It is, in essence, a channel for partners to 
sell into the installed base.

130
Part III: Examining the Cloud Elements 
Like many Platform as a Service providers, Salesforce.com allows indepen­
dent software vendors (ISVs) and commercial developers to join their Force.
com program without any start-up fees. If a developer is selling to exist­
ing Salesforce.com customers via AppExchange, there’s no cost to the ISV. 
However, if an ISV sells a stand-alone application to a new customer that isn’t 
using Salesforce.com, there is an embedded license charge of $15 per user 
per month.
Force.com fees
In addition, developers building Force.com-based sites have the following 
costs:
	
✓	Force.com Free Edition includes up to 250,000 monthly page views. 
(Customers can build one custom application supporting 100 users.) 
Customers needing more access can purchase additional Force.com 
subscriptions for $50 per user per month.
	
✓	Force.com Enterprise Edition includes up to 500,000 monthly page 
views.
	
✓	Force.com Unlimited Edition includes up to one million monthly page 
views.
	
✓	Additional monthly pages are available for $1,000 per month for up to 
one million additional page views (regardless of edition).
Intuit 
Intuit’s target market is the small- and medium-sized businesses that use its 
popular QuickBooks application to run their day-to-day financial operations. 
Intuit has used this foundation combined with a series of acquisitions to 
create a PaaS model. More than 80,000 developers and about four million cus­
tomers are part of the company’s ecosystem.
Federated Applications 
Intuit’s new cloud-based Platform as a Service is called Federated Applications. 
In essence, the developers can write their application with any programming 
language, use any database or cloud computing resource, and then connect 
this code to the Intuit platform via XML-based interfaces and configuration 
files. These developers can then create cloud-based applications by leveraging 
the same development platform that Intuit created to build its own packaged 
applications. 
These components include user interface services, billing services, account 
management, and permissions, data and single sign-on services. Therefore, 
a software developer can use the billing service that Intuit has built instead 

131
 Chapter 11: Exploring Platform as a Service
of building one from scratch. These services are federated together through 
Intuit’s Workplace portal environment. Intuit uses a service-oriented architec­
ture (SOA) to build its platform. For more on SOA, see Chapter 19.
After linking an application to the Intuit Workplace portal, a customer 
is essentially published into Intuit’s cloud marketplace. Therefore, a 
QuickBooks customer can go to the portal and buy an application designed 
to work with QuickBooks. The user interface, account management, security, 
and billing are the same. Integration with QuickBooks is automatic.
Intuit’s Partner Platform 
What are the components of Intuit’s Partner Platform? They are as follows:
	
✓	QuickBase: This Web infrastructure is for small business applications. 
The foundation of the QuickBase platform is a database that includes 
team workflow, communications, and task management. QuickBase pro­
vides partners with support for multi-tenancy. It is used as a collabora­
tion platform by partners.
	
✓	Workplace: This is a portal environment for customers. It can either 
be used as a stand-alone environment or can be integrated with 
QuickBooks. Customers can use a QuickBase application within the 
workplace to control how the application will be presented to individual 
users. In addition, the Workplace also provides services that track sub­
scriptions and revenue.
	
✓	Federated Applications model: With the federated application services, 
developers can integrate existing code through a configuration service. 
There are four integration methods:
 
• Data integration: To integrate at the data level, the partner must 
program to a set of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that 
enable data synchronization. This allows developers to take advan­
tage of the platform’s common cloud data schema (which defines 
the relationships between data elements). For more on data in the 
cloud, see Chapter 8.
 
• Login integration: To integrate at login, the partner uses a 
Federated Identity Web API. After the developer has used this 
API, customers can use their Intuit Workplace login credentials to 
access the partner application that they bought.
 
• User management and permissions integration: Intuit provides 
developers with a Web API so their application can handle pro­
cesses such as adding more users.
 
• Navigation-based integration: A developer who has built a 
Software as a Service–based application can use this tool to pro­
vide the Intuit Workplace toolbar. This allows the customer to 
have common integration.

132
Part III: Examining the Cloud Elements 
Unlike many of the companies in the PaaS market, Intuit charges between 
14–20 percent of revenue to partners who sell through Intuit’s Workplace. 
The exact percentage depends on the volume sold. If the vendor is offering a 
free application via the Workplace, there is a utility fee. While the customer 
buys the application directly from the vendor, the transaction is handled 
directly by Intuit. There are no fees for page views or data storage.
LongJump 
LongJump is a division of Relationals, Inc., a privately held provider of SaaS 
Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and Sales Force Automation (SFA) 
business applications to more than 150 enterprise companies. The company is 
leveraging its platform to move into the platform as a service market — specifi­
cally for companies who are building private clouds. Therefore, it assumes that 
development will take place inside a private data center or inside one of the 
Infrastructure as a Service environments (Amazon, RackSpace, and so on).
The company offers a Java-based development suite that includes a plug-in 
to the Eclipse Integrated Development Environment (IDE). LongJump’s PaaS 
environment enables developers to use services that it calls Building Blocks. 
These services include objects, scripts, component extensions, business 
logic, data policies, and workflows.
A developer uses LongJump’s platform to create Building Blocks that can 
then be reused for other purposes. For example, a single contract object and 
its records can be created and reused by business teams such as sales, busi­
ness development, compliance, legal, and finance by simply modifying data 
policies and workflows.
LongJump Development Suite 
The new LongJump Development Suite includes the following components:
	
✓	A visual browser-based user interface for data and process modeling, as 
well as advanced coding and scripting features for developers who are 
familiar with Java. That way they can enhance and extend applications 
or completely create new data models and processes from scratch.
	
✓	LongJump provides a set of Web services as a technique to allow ser­
vices to communicate and pass data from one to the other (using SOAP 
and REST APIs to connect to external systems or platforms). When 
LongJump objects are extended, those fields are immediately available 
for integration with SOAP and REST APIs, workflow processes, and the 
built-in report creation wizard.

133
 Chapter 11: Exploring Platform as a Service
	
✓	Development Suite features include Java development tools (including 
JSP and HTML-based code), AJAX library, and data model definitions. It 
includes plug-in to a standard Eclipse IDE.
LongJump fees
LongJump offers its development platform free to existing customers of 
its packaged applications. After an application is built on the platform, 
LongJump has a three-tiered pricing model. For premium telephone support, 
call 800-886-9028. The cost is $50 for a 30-minute call, billed prior to the call. 
Additional time is available at $50 for every 30 minutes.
	
LongJump offers a free evaluation version.

attachments to records or in the document library.
LongJump charges for migration service and storage, for adding 50MB of 
data storage, and adding 250MB of document storage per account. (Note that 
50MB of data storage is enough for 50,000 records.)
Enabling Technologies as a Platform
	
No matter what type of Platform as a Service you’re investigating, some tech­
nologies are needed to supplement these platforms. We can’t possibly men­
tion all the emerging technologies or vendors. Instead, we give you a taste of 
three companies and how they help enable PaaS. 

134
Part III: Examining the Cloud Elements 
There are hundreds of different players in different areas. For example, some 
companies provide testing capabilities for PaaS vendors; some companies 
provide management frameworks. Other platforms help customers move 
data and code from on premise to the cloud. 
Testing in the cloud
	
Testing in the cloud is a very critical; however, most platforms don’t provide 
their own testing environment. Therefore, you might want to look at the vari­
ous options on the market. 
Hundreds of vendors, big and small, provide services to test cloud-based 
platforms. They include HP, IBM, and independent companies such as iTKO 
and SOASTA. All have one common capability: They integrate with the plat­
form and enable customers to test their applications before deploying them 
to a public or private cloud. While the platform vendors themselves offer 
their own testing tied to their platform, many customers and developers 
need testing for their own code and for integration testing.
Service management for the cloud
Managing applications created in clouds is a complex area and few platform 
vendors provide their own management services. Therefore, a range of com­
panies are emerging to fill the gap, including companies like RightScale. In 
fact, RightScale is the primary management platform for Amazon.com EC2 
offering. (See Chapter 10 for more on Infrastructure as a Service.) Companies 
including HP, IBM, CA, and others also provide service management offerings 
that are sold independently.
Integration and configuration platforms
	
For cloud development to flourish, you need enabling tools that make it easy 
to customize cloud applications for different end-user needs. A variety of plat­
forms provide capabilities for this need. 
For example, WaveMaker is a cloud-development platform based on Java. It’s 
intended to make it easier for developers to customize and extend Web appli­
cations from a Web browser. It can also integrate existing data and logic into 
a cloud platform. 

135
 Chapter 11: Exploring Platform as a Service
Gigaspaces is another enabling platform. The Gigaspaces XAP cloud PaaS is 
tightly integrated with Amazon EC2’s infrastructure. It allows customers to 
build Web applications for the cloud by migrating existing enterprise applica­
tions. It does this by providing a development platform that supports major 
frameworks, languages, and management environments.
Social network, framework, 
and portal platforms
We could write a whole book on social networks, frameworks, and portals, 
but we want to give you an idea of the type of enabling technology that is a 
natural part of enablement of Platform as a Service. Customers are taking 
advantage of platforms for blogging like Wordpress; they’re using open-
source environments like Joomla to create cloud-based applications. Even 
social networking environments like Facebook and Twitter are becoming a 
part of enablement of the cloud.

Using Software as a Service
In This Chapter
▶	Looking at the origins of SaaS: Salesforce.com
▶	Understanding how the SaaS model works
▶	Understanding the economics and the ecosystem
“W
hen did Software as a Service get its start?” might sound like a 
straightforward question, but it isn’t. In one way, you could say 
that when time-sharing systems were all the rage more than 30 years ago, all 
software was delivered to customers as a service. 
Mainframe systems were simply too expensive for most companies to buy 
their own systems. A couple of decades later, minicomputers, servers, and 
personal computers changed the dynamics of the market. Economically, it 
was feasible for any Tom, Dick, and Harriet to own their own systems and the 
software. Not all software moved to an internal model however. (Software 
such as ADP’s payroll system, for example, remained Software as a Service.)
Two key events converged to create the model that we now call Software as a 
Service (SaaS):
	
✓	First, the Internet became a commercial platform. 
	
✓	Second, software costs and complexities became so difficult that run­
ning, upgrading, and managing software become too complex for many 
companies to manage. This was especially true for small- and medium-
sized companies that didn’t want the expenses of managingall the com­
ponents. These companies were the first to embrace this new generation 
of SaaS. 
Today, SaaS is the most mature area of cloud computing. SaaS gained ini­
tial traction with the customer relationship management (CRM) market and 
has expanded into others — particularly the collaboration market and the 
enabling tools and management environments. In this chapter, we explain 
what SaaS is, talk about its business model, and discuss the types of vendors 
that are in the market today.

138
Part III: Examining the Cloud Elements 
SalesForce.com’s Approach to Evolving 
Software as a Service
	
What’s inside the development environment? And why are we talking about 
this now? SalesForce.com’s approach to its platform is similar to many of the 
platforms on the market. Therefore, understanding what a platform is built on 
will help you make decisions. 
	
You may not see how the product is made, but you’re still responsible for the 
integrity and security of your data and how well the application works. 
Salesforce.com software environment 
Here is a list of the components of the Salesforce.com software environment:
	
✓	Multi-tenancy foundation: Within a multi-tenant architecture, each user’s 
private code is stored in a separate container and is isolated from other 
containers.
	
✓	Metadata: Metadata is an architectural approach that allows each user’s 
customized logic and data to be managed separately.
	
✓	Infrastructure: This data center environment underlies the Salesforce.
com application environment. It includes capabilities such as middle­
ware, security, and database management. It also includes performance 
management and monitoring.
	
✓	Database: There is a set of database services that sits on top of an 
Oracle database. It includes ways to manage data objects and fields, as 
well as documents that are used by the Salesforce.com application.
	
✓	Integration: This set of standardized Web services APIs enables applica­
tions to have a common approach to access information from one appli­
cation to another (as well as data from other enterprise applications). If 
there’s a standardized way to link one SaaS application to another ser­
vice, customers or implementers don’t have to resort to custom coding.
	
✓	Logic: This component includes services that create business processes 
(such as workflow, approval processes, and so on) that the application 
uses.
	
✓	User Interface: This includes a framework and tools to build the way the 
application appears to the customer.

139
 Chapter 12: Using Software as a Service
Digging into the origins of SaaS
You could probably find many examples over 
the years of companies that offered their soft­
ware products as a service. But to keep things 
simple, we start with the company that really 
put Software as a Service as we know it today 
on the map — Salesforce.com. We think that 
the story of how SalesForce.com started and 
how it has evolved says a lot about this market.
Marc Benioff, the founder of SalesForce.com, 
had been a marketing executive for Oracle for 
many years. After leaving and going off on his 
own, he started Salesforce.com. Being a mar­
keting executive, Marc had a bold marketing 
moniker for his fledgling company: No software. 
The plan was quite simple: Create a way to 
allow customers to use a popular application — 
customer relationship management (CRM) over 
the Internet. Customers would purchase a seat 
and could use the application over the Web. 
The customer never had to update the soft­
ware, didn’t have to store data on a server, and 
never had to worry about maintenance fees. If 
that customer was traveling to a remote loca­
tion, he could access his sales leads from any 
PC. There were no capital expenses, with the 
exception of a PC and an Internet connection.
Initial Salesforce.com customers were small 
businesses that had no problem with a com­
pany managing its customer data. These cus­
tomers were willing to take a risk in exchange 
for not having to buy hardware or hire staff. And 
because there was only a one-month commit­
ment, they knew they could simply take their 
customer data and go home if it didn’t work out 
for them.
Larger companies, on the other hand, were 
wary. What was this company? Was it finan­
cially viable; was the software any good? 
Would it be in business very long? If they liked 
the application, could they have the code and 
put it on their own server? SalesForce.com was 
able to convince at least some early custom­
ers that the company was well financed and 
safe to do business with. However, it refused 
to make its code available to companies to run 
on premise. Salesforce.com was able to break 
out of the small companies by selling directly 
to departments of large companies. These 
sales and marketing departments were able 
to put the fees to run Salesforce.com on their 
expense reports. Slowly but surely, Salesforce.
com made inroads into large companies 
that appreciated the ability to avoid buying 
equipment.
What was behind Salesforce.com that custom­
ers did not see? Software, and plenty of it. The 
typical customer doesn’t have to and doesn’t 
want to understand the inner workings of 
Salesforce.com to use it. However, as you see 
later in this chapter, the underlying software that 
developed the offering has become the founda­
tion of the company’s partner ecosystem. 
Like everything in cloud, there are overlaps 
between SaaS and the other areas of cloud 
computing. For example, Salesforce.com has 
a large partnering program for Platform as a 
Service called Force.com. (See Chapter 11 for 
more details on Platform as a Service). The 
foundation of Force.com as a development 
environment for partners is based on its own 
software development platform. 

140
Part III: Examining the Cloud Elements 
SalesForce.com ecosystem 
	
Why are we telling you about what is inside the Salesforce.com software envi­
ronment? We think it’s important to understand that SaaS is a special instance 
of an enterprise application designed to support many different customers 
safely and securely with enough scalability to support changing situations.
In addition, this foundation then becomes the anchor for a rich partner 
ecosystem. Salesforce.com’s partner ecosystem is called Force.com. It is 
a Platform as a Service (see Chapter 11) that allows complementary soft­
ware companies to use this infrastructure and a set of tools developed by 
Salesforce.com to build on top of this CRM platform.
	
This isn’t a new phenomenon. Companies have built partner ecosystems for 
decades. These leading vendors have encouraged independent software ven­
dors to build their applications on top of their enabling software. Companies 
including IBM, HP, Microsoft, and VMware — to name a few — have used this 
approach to build success in the market. The difference with SaaS is that the 
ecosystems of partners are an essential part of the business model.
Today, Salesforce.com has revenues of more than $1 billion with a broad 
ecosystem of partners. Its brand is well regarded and large companies no 
longer ask the company to let them run the software in-house. A strong brand 
is essential to the success of SaaS and any cloud computing environment. 
But Salesforce.com isn’t alone in the market. Companies such as Netsuite, 
Oracle, IBM, HP, Microsoft, Intuit, and hundreds of others have all entered 
the market. 
But before we give you an idea of what types of products are out there, you 
should understand the economics of Software as a Service. While you will 
be reviewing the technical capabilities of solutions, you need to have a clear 
understanding of the economic implications. 
Characterizing Software as a Service
	
What characteristics have to be in place for an SaaS to be commercially 
viable? Here’s what we think is necessary:
	
✓	The SaaS application needs to be generalized enough so that lots of cus­
tomers will be interested in the service. Here are some examples of these 
types of applications: accounting, collaboration, project management, 

141
 Chapter 12: Using Software as a Service
testing, analytics, content management, Internet marketing, risk manage­
ment and of course, CRM. What doesn’t work as SaaS? A specialized one-
of-a-kind application with a small number of potential customers.
	
✓	SaaS applications need sophisticated navigation and ease of use. If an 
SaaS application isn’t easy to use, customers will simply stop subscrib­
ing. Most SaaS vendors offer prospective customers a free trial for a 
month or so. If the customer doesn’t start using the application during 
that first month, it’s likely that the customer won’t sign a contract. This 
is really important because it has been reported that less than 20 per­
cent of users remain customers after the first month or so.
	
✓	The SaaS application needs be modular and service oriented. Without 
this modular approach, it will be hard to change and difficult to have 
third-party independent companies join the ecosystem.
	
✓	An SaaS application needs to include measuring and monitoring so 
customers can be charged actual usage.
	
✓	An SaaS application must have a built-in billing service.
	
✓	SaaS applications need published interfaces and an ecosystem of 
partners who can expand the company’s customer base and 
market reach.
	
✓	SaaS applications have to ensure that each customer’s data and spe­
cialized configurations are separate and secure from other customers’ 
data and configurations.
	
✓	SaaS applications need to provide sophisticated business process con­
figurators for customers. Each customer can change the process within 
the standardized SaaS application. For example, a company might want 
to add a process so a manager has to approve the price being offered to 
a new customer. A built-in configuration tool enables this to be done on 
an ad hoc basis without programming. 
	
✓	SaaS applications need to constantly provide fast releases of new fea­
tures and new capabilities. This must be done without impacting the 
customer’s ability to continue business as usual.
	
✓	SaaS applications have to protect the integrity of customer data. 
That includes providing techniques for allowing data to migrate either 
to a private database inside the firewall or to a third-party storage 
capability.

142
Part III: Examining the Cloud Elements 
Understanding the Economics 
and the Ecosystem
	
The economics of the SaaS market are different than the traditional perpetual 
license software model. In the perpetual license model, the customer pays for 
the total cost of licensing the software and agrees to pay a per-year additional 
cost to cover maintenance and support. Maintenance can be as low as 10 per­
cent or as high as 25 percent of the purchase price. One of the key differences 
with the SaaS model is that the economics are entirely different. The most 
important difference is that there is actually a lower barrier to entry when a 
company is trying to sell you a SaaS product. 
Pretending you’re a customer
Say you’re a customer who’s looking for a CRM product. If you decide that 
SaaS might be the way to go, you can shop around at various vendor Web 
sites, find a product that looks promising, and try it out for free for 30 days. 
What about the traditional 
on-premise software model?
The traditional way companies used software 
was to buy a perpetual license, because it 
doesn’t end, and implement that software on 
their own systems internally. You pay once for 
the software and continue to pay a mainte­
nance fee. This is quite different than the newer 
model of Software as a Service. A company 
offers to sell you a CRM capability. You decide 
on how many users will need the software and 
you pay on a per-month, per-user fee. The com­
pany takes care of all the maintenance of the 
software, the data center, the backup, and the 
support of the system.
Clearly, this varies from the perpetual license 
model of software acquisition. A perpetual 
license model means that the customer pays 
once for a license to the software. In the old 
days, you purchased a server, an operating 
system, a database license, and a license to the 
CRM system. You also probably needed some 
systems management and security software 
and needed to buy a backup drive and assorted 
other components. Every year, you paid a fee 
of between 10–25 percent of the purchase 
price of the software to get updates and soft­
ware patches. Many companies still buy many 
products this way and we don’t expect that to 
change any time soon. Some products are too 
specialized to be sold as SaaS anytime soon.

143
 Chapter 12: Using Software as a Service
If at the end of that trial you decide that this product is really good, the 
company may decide that it is time to buy. Even though you might eventu­
ally want to have the product used by 50 people in the company, you might 
actually buy an entry-level configuration like a 5-user pack to get started. If 
the individuals in the company really like the product, you can add packages 
until you support all 50 users.
Determining the right revenue model costs 
	
What does this mean in terms of the revenue model for vendors and how cus­
tomers should think about weighing the costs between traditional perpetual 
licenses and SaaS-based license? Look at these numbers over a five-year 
period. It can be complex to work out all the details, but here is a general rule: 
	
✓	Take the initial cost for the traditional software purchase.
	
✓	Add an annual fee of 20 percent for maintenance and support.
	
✓	Consider IT costs (including support services and hardware renewal, 
and so on. (For example, does your data center have enough room for 
the new CRM application? Will you need to add support staff or new 
management software?) 
	
The other factor to consider is that the vendor might do everything it can to 
make you a customer. They might have some special incentives. For example, 
many SaaS vendors offer packaged deals. (An instance is if you decide to pay 
for a full year upfront, the price will be less; if you purchase large numbers of 
licenses, the costs will also be less.) 
Calculating two examples
If you buy a traditional software product, it will cost you a one-time fee of 
$100,000. Now you have to add an annual fee of 20 percent for maintenance 
and support. If you look at the costs over five years, for example, you may 
determine the following: Software will cost $100,000; maintenance expenses 
will add another $100,000 over five years, for a total five-year cost of 
$200,000. 
	
You have to consider all the related infrastructure costs. (Take a look at 
Chapter 21 for a full discussion on the economics of the cloud.) We can’t 
begin to give you a sense of what that will cost you because every situation 
is different. For example, you might already have a sophisticated data center 
with excess capacity and sufficient staff to support an additional application. 
Or you might have to add everything from new hardware to networking to 
backup and support personnel. Do you charge each department based on 
their percentage usage of data center resources? Do you divide costs evenly 
between all departments as you would utilities such as electricity? No matter 
how your organization calculates expenses, that must be taken into account.

144
Part III: Examining the Cloud Elements 
	
Many small- and medium-sized businesses lack or don’t want the data centers 
that their larger counterparts have. Larger companies that can calculate the 
long-term impact of adding applications are also looking seriously at the SaaS 
cloud model.
If you go the SaaS route, here’s what you’re looking at: You determine that to 
support 50 users, it will cost you between $10 and $150 per user, per month. 
That figure includes support, general training, and data center services. Even 
if you take the high-end estimate of $150 per user, the cost of using the CRM 
SaaS application for those 50 users for 5 years will run about $37,500 — far 
less than the $200,000 cost of on-premise software, even when you add other 
costs (such as customization of business processes within the application 
and personnel training).
	
We can’t give you an absolute figure; do your homework and compare all 
aspects of running software before you decide which approach is best for you. 
Prices can vary widely from an open-source version that offers support for a 
price to vendors that provide the software plus full integration services. 
For example, you might look at an open-source CRM product. Although the 
basic product is free, you get no support or software upgrades, and must rely 
on finding patches and bug fixes from the community. If you’re very techni­
cal, that might be a fine choice, but many customers want to pay for support 
to avoid a lot of headaches.
The value of the ecosystem
When SaaS vendors become well-established brands in the market, they 
attract an ecosystem (a set of partners that works directly with a key vendor, 
both in technical and go-to-market terms) that sees the value of linkage. 
This is how it works: A SaaS vendor with thousands of paying customers 
opens up its programming interfaces to other independent software vendors. 
These vendors create software that sits on top of the infrastructure of the 
SaaS vendor. Therefore, they can get to market quickly because they only 
have to write their industry-specific code. They don’t worry about messaging 
middleware, or business process services, or other complex programming. In 
addition, they can market their software to the SaaS vendor’s happy custom­
ers (either through the SaaS vendor’s portal or through the partner’s direct 
sales force). This has become a standard model used by SaaS vendors to 
build their brand and power in the market. 
If you’re a customer who has licensed an SaaS application, you’ll probably 
find another application that’s built on the same infrastructure that easily 
integrates with what you already have.

145
 Chapter 12: Using Software as a Service
Examining Types of SaaS Platforms
Because SaaS has been around longer than most other types of cloud com­
puting, hundreds — if not thousands — of companies are trying to become 
leaders. It isn’t easy. They face many obstacles. For example, it costs a lot of 
money initially to build the type of data center and the applications that can 
scale to support thousands of companies (and potentially millions of indi­
vidual users). It takes time to turn a one-month free trial into a long-term con­
tract. Despite these obstacles, some very successful SaaS companies exist, 
ranging from emerging players to the big IT companies. 
Building an app on top of Salesforce.com
CODA is a software company that has been 
in the financial services packaged software 
market since the 1970s. The company had 
always partnered with on-premise soft­
ware vendors such as HP, Digital Equipment 
Corporation, and IBM. In addition, the company 
liked to move to new platforms as they emerged 
(including the mainframe, the minicomputer, 
and client/server). 
There came a time when CODA wanted to move 
quickly to take advantage of the movement to 
Software as a Service. Moving to a new plat­
form was based on the ambitious plan to do 
for financial products what Salesforce.com 
has done for CRM. Needless to say, it was an 
ambitious goal. CODA management began to 
appreciate the potential for SaaS as a way to 
build customers faster than the sales process 
of on-premise software. Before deciding to 
use sForce (Salesforce.com’s development 
platform), the company performed a return-on-
investment analysis. 
The challenge was the cost of writing the code 
from scratch internally. Basically, development 
management realized that they would have 
to write for a multi-tenancy environment that 
would have required several years of work to 
get the right infrastructure services in place. 
They simply couldn’t justify the expense or the 
time required for development. Without worry­
ing about any specific software infrastructure, 
CODA’s developers focused on customer-
facing features such as specialized processes 
for different industries. 
Unlike some of the smaller companies that have 
built on top of sForce, CODA is a large company 
that serves mid-market companies. Salesforce.
com needs CODA as much as CODA needs 
them. Salesforce.com needed to prove to the 
market that its platform could support a major 
application. CODA’s application is happy with 
its relationship and is saving time and money. 
The test will be if customers adopt its new SaaS 
platform.
CODA wrote its application with Salesforce.
com’s Java-like language called APEX. 
Therefore, the company’s locked into the 
Salesforce.com platform. From a go-to-market 
perspective, however, this is a plus because 
Salesforce.com will help CODA sell into its cus­
tomer base.

146
Part III: Examining the Cloud Elements 
We don’t have the room to give you an exhaustive list of every company you 
might find, but we plan to give you a taste of what is out there. (In Chapter 
23, we list resources that will help you identify even more players.)
It can be overwhelming when you look at how many companies have created 
SaaS versions of their products — even companies whoseprimary focus is 
the on-premise model feel compelled to offer customers a SaaS version of 
their offerings. 
To help you make sense of this complicated world, we divide SaaS into three 
categories:
	
✓	Packaged software: This is the biggest area of the SaaS market. 
Packaged software comes in many different flavors: customer relation­
ship management, supply chain management, financial management, 
and human resources, to name the most common. These integrated 
offers focus on a specific process, such as managing employees’ ben­
efits, salaries, and annual performance reviews. These products tend 
to have several characteristics in common: They’re designed with spe­
cific business processes built in that customers can modify. They have 
moved in great numbers to the cloud because customers were finding 
the platforms too hard to manage. 
	
✓	Collaborative software: This increasingly vibrant area of the market is 
driven by the ubiquitous availability of the Internet, combined with the 
fact that teams are located all over the world. This area is dominated by 
software that focuses on all sorts of collaborative efforts including Web 
conferencing, document collaboration, project planning, instant mes­
saging, and even email. In a sense, it was inevitable that these platforms 
would move to the cloud: These tasks occur throughout the organiza­
tion and need to be easily accessed from many locations.
	
✓	Enabling and management tools: We brought these two areas together 
because they support the development and the deployment of SaaS. 
What’s in this category? Think about the development tools that devel­
opers need when creating and extending a SaaS platform; also think 
about the testing, monitoring, and measuring that a customer and the 
developer need. Also consider the compliance issues related to the use 
of this type of software in the real world. These issues are included in 
this third category.
In the next section, we give you a taste for the vendors in each of these cat­
egories, what they offer customers, and the issues you should consider. We 
can’t possibly do this topic justice, but we give you a road map for how to 
understand the offerings and issues.

147
 Chapter 12: Using Software as a Service
Packaged Software as a Service
	
We write a lot about how Salesforce.com created customer relationship man­
agement (CRM) as a service. It took a few years, but the company invested in 
its infrastructure, built a flexible and modular application, and made the navi­
gation easier. But as with any successful venture, Salesforce.com competitors 
soon began entering the market in droves.
What companies are out in the market today that you should look at? It isn’t 
as straightforward as it might sound. This is a dynamic market, so whatever 
company looks promising today could be gone tomorrow. On the other hand, 
the small emerging company that looks too new to consider could become 
a major force. Likewise, companies that have been successful as on-premise 
software providers are streaming into the SaaS market and could become 
viable competitors. 
Companies in the packaged software market include the following:
	
✓	Netsuite, like Salesforce.com, offers a CRM foundation. Since its founding 
in 1998, Netsuite has added a number of modules for enterprise resource 
planning (ERP) application including financial capabilities, e-commerce, 
and business intelligence.
	
✓	Intuit provides a Financial Services Suite of products that support 
accounting services for small- and medium-sized businesses. The com­
pany provides a rich set of interfaces that enables partners to connect 
their services and applications into its environment.
	
✓	RightNow provides a CRM suite of products that includes marketing, 
sales, and various industry solutions.
	
✓	Concur focuses on employees spend management. It automates costs 
control via automated processes.
	
✓	Taleo focuses on talent management tasks.
	
✓	SugarCRM is a CRM platform built on an open-source platform. The 
company offers support for a fee.
	
✓	Constant Contact is a marketing automation platform that partners 
directly with Salesforce.com and other CRM platforms. They automate 
the process of sending emails and other marketing efforts.
Some of the traditional on-premise software companies have also moved into 
the packaged SaaS market, including 
	
✓	Microsoft with its Dynamics package 
	
✓	SAP with its By Design offering for the small- to medium-sized business market 
	
✓	Oracle with its On Demand offering based on its acquisition of Siebel 
Software

148
Part III: Examining the Cloud Elements 
Collaboration as a Service
Collaboration is one of the natural markets for SaaS. There’s enough band­
width and all companies are connecting to the Internet. In addition, more 
companies than ever have remote offices and workers across the globe. A 
team may be easily be spread across 100 locations in 40 different countries! 
	
With the availability of SaaS-based collaboration services, things have 
changed dramatically. Although it hasn’t yet surfaced as a major market, we 
expect that there will be companies that offer unified communications (an inte­
gration of telephony, instant messaging, and email) as a service. These offer­
ings will come from the large telecommunications companies in partnerships 
with companies like HP and IBM. GoogleVoice could emerge as an important 
player in the future. 
What companies are focused on collaboration as a service today? The follow­
ing is a list to get you started:
	
✓	MicrosoftLive has made its first foray into collaboration as a service 
with its Meeting Live offering. Today Microsoft offers Meeting Live and 
live messaging services. In addition, Microsoft offers the ability to run 
its email server (Exchange as a Service). In the future, the company will 
have online versions of many of its collaborative applications.
	
✓	LotusLive is IBM’s collaborative environment that includes a set of tools 
including social networking, instant messaging, and the ability to share 
files and conduct online meetings. IBM is publishing interfaces to allow 
other collaborative tools to be integrated into the platform.
	
✓	GoogleApps from Google, which has as many as 1.5 million businesses 
that use its various collaborative applications including e-mail, docu­
ment management, and instant messaging. It publishes APIs so third-
party software developers can integrate with the platform.
	
✓	Cisco Webex Collaboration platform comes from Cisco (which bought 
Webex in 2007) and it has become the centerpiece of its collaboration 
SaaS platform. It will probably use this platform to add unified communi­
cations as a service.
	
✓	Zoho, an open-source collaboration platform, includes email, document 
management, project management, and invoice management. It offers 
APIs to its environment and has begun to integrate its collaboration 
tools with other companies, such as Microsoft. Zoho offers support for 
a fee.
	
✓	Citrix GotoMeeting offers an online meeting service as part of its 
larger suite of virtualization products. See Chapter 17 for more about 
virtualization. 

149
 Chapter 12: Using Software as a Service
Enabling and management tools
How you use all sorts of software in your organization is changing dramati­
cally — whether you’re considering a supply chain as a service or a word 
processor as a service. As we discuss in Chapters 10 and 11, many companies 
are looking to service providers for needed functionality. 
Underneath many of these environments is the open-source Eclipse frame­
work. A set of enabling and management tools is being offered on a service 
basis. Although some of these services might actually be delivered within a 
private cloud in your own data center, many vendors will enable you to use 
their data center services. In this section, we talk about the enabling tech­
nologies that are being offered as services.
Over time, a lot more software and capabilities will be offered as a service, 
but we talk about five different areas in this section, including
	
✓	Testing as a service
	
✓	Monitoring and management as a service
	
✓	Development as a service
	
✓	Security as a service
	
✓	Compliance and governance as a service
Testing as a service
	
Testing is one of the biggest uses for cloud computing. Even when a company 
moves to using a public or private cloud, it still needs to conduct the same 
testing it would need in an on-premise data center , including 
	
✓	Functional testing 
	
✓	Unit testing
	
✓	Stress testing
	
✓	Compatibility testing
	
✓	Performance testing
	
✓	Requirements management 
	
✓	Integration testing
One of the biggest problems for developers is accurately simulating the con­
ditions (expected and unexpected) when software is deployed.

150
Part III: Examining the Cloud Elements 
	
In addition, more companies are looking at testing as a service and develop­
ment as a service as a way to keep track of development teams that are often 
distributed across the globe. 
Having developers rely on SaaS-based services for testing can save tremen­
dous amounts of time and money. When developers embark on testing, they 
often ask for hardware and software to get the task done. Typically, these 
organizations can’t recoup the systems they hand over to developers. Many 
vendors produce testing as a service platforms, including HP, IBM, Sogeti (a 
United Kingdom–based IT services firm), Compuware, as well as smaller com­
panies such as iTKO and SOASTA. We could actually name hundreds that are 
pouring into the testing-as-a-service space. 
Monitoring and management as a service
	
Is what you see what you get? Maybe. That’s why companies using SaaS need 
to do some of their own monitoring to determine if their service levels have 
been met by their SaaS providers. Even more complicated is when companies 
are using more than one SaaS application. And to complicate things even fur­
ther, you must monitor not just a single application but also the combination 
of applications. 
Companies in the systems management space are positioning themselves for 
this world. Vendors come at this market from two different perspectives: 
	
✓	From the top down, large telecommunications are packaging their capa­
bilities so they can help provide cloud management and monitoring. 
	
✓	You also see traditional Web services monitoring companies offering 
services that will tell you if your Web site has added new services to 
support the cloud.
Development tooling as a service
Developers beginning to create new software are increasingly turning to 
development as a service. (In other words, development is done in a cloud-
based environment instead of implementing development within a single 
internal-development environment.) This delivery model of development 
infrastructure can be done through one of the Platform as a Service vendors 
such as Google, Intuit, Microsoft, Force.com, and Bungee Labs. (See Chapter 
11 for more on Platform as a Service.) Likewise, Infrastructure as a Service 
vendors such as Amazon.com offer support services for developers. (See 
Chapter 10 on Infrastructure as a Service.)
Security as a service
Almost without exception, vendors providing antivirus software are offering 
their products as a service. These vendors include Symantec, McAfee, CA, 
and Kapersky Labs. In addition, companies such as Hewlett-Packard and IBM 
have tools that scan environments for vulnerability scanning and testing. 

151
 Chapter 12: Using Software as a Service
	
Identity management is an important aspect of on premise as well as cloud 
services. Lots of companies in this market will begin offering identity manage­
ment as a service.
Compliance and governance as a service
Compliance and governance tasks are time consuming and complicated tasks 
that large companies are required to do. Therefore, offering these capabili­
ties as a service is critical. 
Not surprisingly, hundreds of companies are moving into this market. 
Services that are becoming SaaS include the following:
	
✓	Patch management
	
✓	Business continuity planning
	
✓	Discovery of records and messages
	
✓	Various governance requirements such as SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley) in the 
United States and SaS 70 (Statement of Audit Standard) controls for data
For more on governance, see Chapter 16.

ou can gain cost efficiencies by provisioning capacity on demand from 
a cloud provider. Or you can increase the overall efficiency of your data 
center with a private cloud; see Chapter 9. Bearing all that in mind, cloud 
providers have a unique sweet spot based on their use of massively scaled 
applications. In this chapter, we describe how companies use massively 
scaled cloud applications to offer highly cost-effective business processes 
and services. 
	
What do we mean by massively scaled? Millions of users doing exactly the 
same thing. When you do that, you drastically reduce the cost per user. 
Most businesses require their data centers to facilitate the operation of many 
different types of workloads — such as compute-intensive analytics, col­
laboration capabilities for employees, virtualized desktop management, or 
business services like billing. Your typical IT infrastructure needs to be flex­
ible enough to support lots of change and you need to build in redundancy to 
make sure that each workload has the capacity it needs when necessary. 
But just imagine building a large data center with only one or two transac­
tions in mind. You can make decisions about software architecture, hard­
ware, and communications that enable a very efficient data center when 
you’re designing for massive repetitions of a single type of workload.

Naming Names: Companies with 
Massively Scaled Applications
We use Amazon as an example because it’s both an online retailer and a 
cloud services provider. (We provide more details about Amazon’s IaaS offer­
ings in Chapter 10.) Most of the companies offering massively scaled applica­
tions are either online retailers or cloud providers, but not both. Many of the 
companies in this space deliver a low-cost (or free) business process as a 
service. 
In general these businesses have very high user populations allowing them to 
drive per-user costs of software down to record low levels. When a business pro­
cess such as email management is delivered from a massively scaled data center, 
your own data center can’t come close to matching the cloud center’s price.
	
Massive data centers evolved with Internet growth. Internet-based businesses 
like Amazon probably didn’t realize they’d be assembling such large data cen­
ters. Their business grew and they expanded into their massive data center as 
the Internet evolved. Companies like this may have predicted the future, but 
they can’t have known for sure that their Web traffic was going to be so high.
Listing the companies
It’s worth describing some of the businesses that deliver massively scaled 
cloud applications and business processes. You may not have thought of 
some of these companies as providing a business process as a service. 
Most of the businesses listed here covered uncharted business territory 
when they developed their service. For this reason, the services they offer 
may not traditionally be thought of as businesses services — but that is 
really what they are. 
Here’s a list of companies in this field and the business processes they 
deliver:
	
✓	eBay at www.ebay.com provides an electronic auction service.
	
✓	PayPal at www.paypal.com is owned by eBay. PayPal operates inde­
pendently. It provides an Internet payment capability as a service.
	
✓	Skype at www.skype.com also is partially owned by eBay and a private 
equity firm. It provides Voice over IP (VoIP) telephone calls as a service, 
most of which are free.

155
 Chapter 13: Understanding Massively Scaled Applications
	
✓	Google at www.google.com provides an Internet search capability as 
a service. (This service is free when you have access to the Internet.) 
Additionally, Google provides an Internet email service, Gmail. There 
are quite a few other Google services including maps, news aggregation, 
Google apps, and so on.
	
✓	YouTube at www.youtube.com was acquired by Google. YouTube pro­
vides video self-publishing as a service.
	
✓	Yahoo! at www.yahoo.com is like Google, providing an Internet search 
service and email service. Yahoo’s email service is the most widely used 
in the world.
	
✓	Flickr at www.flickr.com provides photo publishing as a service.
	
✓	Wikipedia at www.wikipedia.org is an encyclopedia as a service.
	
✓	Craigslist at www.craigslist.org offers small ads as a service.
	
✓	WordPress at www.wordpress.org does blog hosting as a service.
	
✓	Twitter at www.twitter.com offers microblogging, or short messages, 
as a service. It can be used in several useful ways by companies and 
individuals.
	
✓	Internet Movie Database at www.imdb.com was acquired by Amazon. 
IMDB provides information about movies as a service.
	
✓	Digg at www.digg.com offers news aggregation as a service.
	
✓	Facebook at www.facebook.com is personal information, social net­
working, and email combined as a service.
	
✓	LinkedIn at www.linkedin.com is business contacts and networking 
as a service. 
Defining business process as a service
Business processes are the steps you take or 
the activities you perform to facilitate the deliv­
ery of products or services to your customers 
or stakeholders. These business processes 
(such as managing email, shipping packages, 
or writing a marketing document) are delivered 
as a service when they’re delivered to you in an 
automated, standardized, and repeatable way 
from a cloud service provider.

156
Part III: Examining the Cloud Elements 
This is by no means an exhaustive list and the services aren’t only useful to 
consumers. For example, many businesses use eBay to sell things that they 
want to dispose of and some businesses are entirely eBay based. Many Web 
businesses depend upon PayPal as their principal payment mechanism. 
Businesses advertise on Craigslist. A fair number use Twitter as a public rela­
tions outlet. Another point to note is that all these businesses have tens of 
millions of customers. Nearly all of them require very large data centers to 
cater to their millions of customers. 
	
As we mention, because massively scaled data centers are designed to sup­
port a specific type of workload across millions of users, the cost efficiencies 
are so great that it is very hard to compete with them.
Looking at Web-based business services
You might be inclined to think that Web-based businesses are somehow dif­
ferent from the companies to which you outsource your energy generation or 
the companies that provide your communications, but they’re very similar.
	
It’s easy to be misled by the fact that many of these Web-based companies 
started out without a well-defined revenue stream and some of them have yet 
to demonstrate a viable business model for their activities. 
This is currently the case, for example, with Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube, 
all of whom exist just because their investors (or Google in the case of 
YouTube) believe that they will eventually find a profitable way of operating.
Most of the businesses we mention are dominant in their field because these 
vendors have established very forbidding barriers to entry because of their 
scalable infrastructure and their ability to deliver services at a very low cost. 
There were quite a few Internet auction houses before eBay began to domi­
nate the field, and there have been several attempts by would-be competitors 
to penetrate eBay’s market, but none have made much of an impact.
With search, the situation is different. It is dominated by Google, but Yahoo! 
and Microsoft have significant market share, so the market is genuinely 
divided even though one company dominates. However, it’s tough, even if 
you have the billions of dollars in funding available to Microsoft, to change 
the profile of the market.
	
Just like power generation and telecomms, such businesses have very high 
customer retention and the financial barriers to entry are very great. These 
Internet companies may have started out small, but they are now giants in 
their field. Just as no company is likely to think of building its own hydroelec­
tric power station or telecommunications network, no company is going to 
build its own Internet search capability.

157
 Chapter 13: Understanding Massively Scaled Applications
Delivering Business Processes 
from the Cloud
We’re moving from one world (where companies built their own software or 
used packaged software for all their business processes) to another (where 
some of these business processes can be provided directly from the cloud).
Business process examples
Economic considerations indicate that the business processes that will be 
sold as a service will be those that can have a very large number of users and 
that can be defined relatively simply. 
Consider three distinct examples:
	
✓	A molecular modeling program: Organic chemists carry out molecular 
modeling by using PC software. This capability could be delivered from 
the cloud. However, there just aren’t enough organic chemists for a 
cloud business to be feasible right now. The economics wouldn’t work.
	
✓	An accounting capability: Companies such as Intuit, NetSuite, Aplicor, 
and BizAutomation offer capable accounting software as a cloud service. 
They’re excellent examples of SaaS, but they don’t amount to outsourc­
ing a business process because the business process of accounting, a 
required function at most businesses, varies according to the type of 
business and how the financial accounts are managed. While elements 
of the accounting process are common to lots of businesses — sending 
invoices or managing customer addresses — many elements are unique 
to each business. In other words, the accounting process requires some­
one to do the accounting. 
	
	For this reason, while many vendors deliver accounting services in the 
cloud, the services aren’t likely to grow to massively scaled applications 
in the same way as email applications have. 
	
✓	Email: The business process of managing email can be standardized 
across millions of users. Few businesses need to run email systems from 
the data center. Running it from the cloud is far less expensive: Recent 
cost figures suggest between 1⁄10 and 1⁄20 of the price. What’s more, both 
Google and Yahoo already provide email to many businesses.

158
Part III: Examining the Cloud Elements 
Business processes destined for the cloud
Some applications that embody business processes are inevitably destined 
for the cloud because of the very high number of users and their ease of use 
in a cloud context. 
These applications form two groups:
	
✓	Existing applications that are migrating to the cloud. The cloud makes 
the most sense for these established applications (such as email).
	
✓	New applications whose use in the cloud is taking off faster than its use 
through software installed in the data center, or where there isn’t any 
data center choice available. Voice over IP (VoIP) is an example.
Hidden in the cloud
If you haven’t had much contact with Web businesses, you may not know 
that nearly all their important business processes are run from the cloud, 
often at very low cost. For example, unless you run a very large Web site, 
the Web statistics software you use is most likely provided by Google. Your 
email system likely runs on your Web server, which itself is probably located 
in some Internet service provider (ISP) somewhere. If you carry ads on your 
Web site, you’re probably using an ad server of some kind, which, again, 
doesn’t run out of your offices. Selling ads to fill the available space on your 
site is probably outsourced to an advertising broker.
Your Web site itself is probably running on software built by someone else 
with various software modules provided by yet another company. The pho­
tographs displayed on your Web site may well be sourced from another Web 
site, and even some of the content may be sourced from content syndication 
operations.
It is easy to think up a list of the business processes and applications that 
will, as a general rule, be run from the cloud in the future. A few organizations 
will run such applications themselves, for reasons of security or possibly 
technology integration, but most will not because of cost.
Business processes already flying high
Here is a list of business processes that are already available from the 
cloud and are probably destined to reside in the cloud for the vast majority 
of companies:

159
 Chapter 13: Understanding Massively Scaled Applications
	
✓	Clerical activity: Office software such as word processing, spread­
sheets, and so on
	
✓	Communications: Unified communications, email, Instant Messaging 
(IM), voice, conferencing
	
✓	Collaboration: Desktop-to-desktop capabilities, from webinars through 
to collaborative work and file sharing
	
✓	Data backup and disaster recovery
	
✓	Payment technology: PayPal, credit cards, voucher schemes, and so on
	
✓	Research: Including marketing research, technical research, patent 
research, and almost all other areas of research
	
✓	Web site work: Design, content, advertising, and SEO.
We could add many other things to this list — for example, the businesses of 
insurance, banking, package delivery, travel booking, and hotel booking. We 
might not think of these businesses as cloud services, but by any reasonable 
definition, they are.
Predicting the future
The best way to understand what’s likely to happen with cloud computing is 
to study what has happened with businesses that work mainly in the cloud. 
Web-based businesses are exactly like that. Even when Web-based busi­
nesses are large, many of their business processes are assembled by linking 
software together, often in a way that’s no more sophisticated than simply 
linking to it from a Web page. Consider, for example, a small site belonging 
to a publisher that sells books over the Web, as well as selling them through 
Amazon.com.
Payment is likely to be by PayPal. A client may publish books through a 
printer, but most likely the books will be stored by the printer and fulfilled 
by the printer — with orders sent directly from the Web site by email. This 
will be the case for individual orders, but also for direct orders from Amazon. 
Much of the rest of the business involves attracting people to the Web site to 
market the books via search engine optimization. Proper search engine opti­
mization increases the odds that a Web site will be returned in the results of 
a Web search, and is fostered by the analysis of Web site stats, the addition 
of appropriate content, and Web design. (For more on this topic, see Search 
Engine Optimization For Dummies, Wiley.)
Now try to envisage other businesses running in this way. It’s not that hard 
to do, because the vast majority of small to medium businesses only do one 
or two unique things — and that means most of their business processes are 
common, mundane, and a good fit for cloud computing.

160
Part III: Examining the Cloud Elements 
Mashups and other unintended consequences
One curious aspect of the move toward the 
cloud is the innovative behavior of some com­
puter users. For example, when Twitter got 
started, some marketing people quickly realized 
that it could become a PR and marketing chan­
nel. They started to reinforce their marketing 
activity by posting messages on Twitter.
A similar phenomenon happened with 
Facebook. When it began to grow, some com­
panies used it to replace their intranet, reduc­
ing their IT costs considerably. The use of 
Facebook in this way proved particularly effec­
tive in distributed organizations. Some compa­
nies are even using Facebook as part of their 
personnel systems.
The unpredictable use of such applications is 
encouraged by the fact that many of the ven­
dors are very happy to publish their APIs (pro­
grammer interfaces). Not only is it possible to 
use (often free) applications in ways that were 
never intended, but you can link Web sites 
to create a service that neither site initially 
intended to deliver.
Aside from the fact that this has spurred some 
interesting uses of sites such as Google maps, 
it means that often you can integrate these Web 
services with software built in-house. There are 
no formal service contracts or agreed-upon 
service levels, but many companies seem not 
to care.

Chapter 14
Setting Some Standards 
In This Chapter
▶	Understanding the importance of standards
▶	Figuring out why standards are needed in the cloud
▶	Understanding what standards exist today
A
sk knowledgeable companies about their top worries about moving to 
the cloud. Two major reasons would no doubt be security and vendor 
lock-in. Read more about security in Chapter 15. This chapter tackles vendor 
lock-in: being stuck with one cloud provider because of interoperability or 
portability issues. Standards and best practices address these two concerns.
If standards are the directions, best practices are the blueprint for creating 
techniques or methods that result in predictable outcomes in the real world. 
For example, you might have a best practice designed to ensure security in 
cloud environments.
Understanding Best Practices 
and Standards
Best practices and standards provide a starting recipe, appropriate tools, 
required ingredients, and some tips and tricks. 
The idea is fewer errors will occur if organizations follow best practices 
(because the processes, techniques, and methodologies they’re using have 
been repeatedly tested). The same holds true for standards. Standards mean 
that you don’t need to constantly reinvent the same thing. And, best prac­
tices and standards for managing critical aspects such as data security and 
privacy help ensure quality for crucial workloads in the cloud. 

162
Part III: Examining the Cloud Elements 
Best practicing makes perfect
Best practices are accumulated knowledge that can help individuals and orga­
nizations avoid mistakes others have made. 
They provide 
	
✓	A starting point for planning 
	
✓	A common language 
	
✓	A set of concepts that help you communicate and coordinate with large 
groups of people
Best practices range from recommendations for specific coding specifica­
tions to describing enterprise-wide management processes that have shown 
proven success. 
Best practices can be found in many places:
	
✓	Industry organizations 
	
✓	Independent books
	
✓	Training materials 
	
✓	Vendor Web sites 
	
✓	Consulting practices
Setting your sites on standards
Standards are a core set of common and repeatable best practices that 
have been agreed upon by a business or industry group. Typically, differ­
ent vendors, industry user groups, and end users collaborate to develop 
standards based on the broad expertise of a large number of stakeholders. 
Organizations can leverage these standards as a common foundation and 
build on top of them.
Standards, or agreed-upon approaches, let you 
	
✓	Move your infrastructure or applications from one cloud provider to 
another. 
	
✓	More easily integrate applications between your on-premise data center 
and private and public cloud environments. 

163
 Chapter 14: Setting Some Standards
	
Standards are useless unless you implement them. 
Standards are made two ways: 
	
✓	A big standards body develops it. The International Organization for 
Standardization (ISO) is an example of a standards organization. This 
group is made up of representatives from countries all over the world. 
ISO has developed over 17,500 standards covering many subject areas, 
and more standards are developed every year. These standards are well 
documented so people can learn what they need to adopt a standard. 
ISO standards cover many areas of IT, including standards for IT service 
management and the governance of IT services. 
	
✓	A best practice becomes a de facto standard. A de facto standard 
emerges because a product or approach is used enough that it becomes 
a standard. For example, the networking protocol called TCP/IP was 
adopted by so many vendors that over time it became the networking 
standard. 
Clouding the Standards and 
Best Practices Issue
Cloud standards are in the early phases of being developed and imple­
mented. Some are coming along, but, to many watching the development of 
these standards, it can seem like the Wild West.
	
Despite some potential hurdles, standards and best practices are important — 
especially in the cloud — because they help improve choice, reduce cost, and 
improve quality. 
Standards are important for the cloud in a number of areas: 
	
✓	Interoperability
	
✓	Portability
	
✓	Integration
	
✓	Security

164
Part III: Examining the Cloud Elements 
Interoperability
Interoperability refers to cloud users being able to take their tools, applica­
tions, virtual images, and so on and use them in another cloud environment 
without having to do any rework. Say one application runs in one environ­
ment and you need that application to operate with a partner’s application 
in another cloud environment. If the right interoperability standards are in 
place, you can do this without needing multiple versions of this application. 
Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), Representational State Transfer 
(REST), and Atom Syndication Format and Atom PublishingProtocol (both 
standards referred to as Atom) are all examples of widely used interoperabil­
ity standards and protocols.
Portability
Portability lets you take one application or instance running on one vendor’s 
implementation and deploy it on another vendor’s implementation. For exam­
ple, you might want to move your database or application from one cloud 
environment to another.
Standards examples 
One example of a standard that has gotten 
some traction in the cloud environment is the 
Open Virtual Format (OVF) developed by the 
Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF). 
It was developed jointly by the likes of Citrix, 
Dell, HP, IBM, Microsoft, and VMWare. The 
idea is to streamline the installation of a vir­
tualized platform. This standard addresses 
interoperability issues for virtual machines. The 
multivendor format includes a set of metadata 
(virtual machine hard drives, information about 
resource requirements, a digital signature, and 
so on) that enables virtual machines to be used 
in multiple environments. 
Another example of a standard that’s get­
ting some attention is ISO 27001 for informa­
tion management. This existing standard was 
developed by the International Organization for 
Standardization (ISO) (www.iso.org). This 
specification for information security manage­
ment system consists of policies and proce­
dures that include legal, physical, and technical 
controls over an information infrastructure. The 
specification includes a six-part planning pro­
cess that includes defining a security policy, 
conducting risk assessments, establishing 
control objectives, and preparing a statement 
of applicability.

165
 Chapter 14: Setting Some Standards
Integration
When you think integration, you generally think of combining various hard­
ware and software components together to create something. The same idea 
applies in the cloud. One example of integration: easily integrating your data 
with a Software as a Service application. This is an example of taking some of 
your internal IT capability and integrating it into the cloud environment.
	
Portability and integration become major issues when cloud vendors have dif­
ferent platforms. This can lead to vendor lock-in, which means that moving to 
another cloud provider is so difficult that you don’t even bother trying.
Security
Cloud security is such a big concern that we devote Chapter 15 to it. You 
need to make sure that the right controls, procedures, and technology are 
in place to protect your corporate assets. Your organization has invested a 
lot internally to protect your assets, and it’s reasonable to assume that your 
cloud provider should do the same.
Cloud security standards are a set of processes, policies, and best practices 
that ensure that the proper controls are placed over an environment to pre­
vent application, information, identity, and access issues (to name a few). 
Two organizations that are very active in this area are the Cloud Security 
Alliance and a think tank called the Jericho Forum. These are profiled later in 
this chapter.
Open Cloud Manifesto
The notion of an open cloud is so critical to the 
long-term success of the cloud that more than 
200 vendors have already signed on to support 
a document called the Open Cloud Manifesto 
(www.opencloudmanifesto.org). The 
group realizes that although the cloud presents 
a great opportunity, a series of challenges must 
be overcome. These challenges include secu­
rity, interoperability, portability, management 
and metering, and governance. The manifesto 
has a series of statements related to standards.

166
Part III: Examining the Cloud Elements 
Standards Organizations and Groups
A number of organizations and informal groups are addressing standards 
issues in the cloud environment — we detail several in this section. Some of 
these organizations have been around for years; others are relatively new. 
It is important to note that some of these standards bodies aren’t necessarily 
looking to create new standards. One idea is to leverage existing best prac­
tices and standards such as those used in implementing the Web and service 
oriented architectures.
	
Several standards organizations have gotten together to create a cloud stan­
dards coordination wiki — a Web site that uses collaborative software (also 
called wiki) to allow many people to work together to post and edit content. 
All groups can post their work in one spot: www.cloud-standards.org. 
Cloud Security Alliance
	
The Cloud Security Alliance (www.cloudsecurityalliance.org) formed 
in late 2008 when cloud security became important in user’s minds. Its found­
ing members include PGP, QualSys, Zscaler, and the Information Systems 
Audit and Control Association (ISACA). 
The CSA’s goal is to promote a series of best practices to provide security 
assurance in cloud computing. Its objectives include 
	
✓	Promoting understanding between users and providers of cloud comput­
ing regarding security requirements
	
✓	Researching best practices for cloud security
	
✓	Launching awareness campaigns about cloud security solutions
	
✓	Creating consensus lists of issues and guidance for cloud security 
assurance
The Cloud Security Alliance recently published “Guidance for Critical Areas 
of Focus in Cloud Computing,” which is available at www.cloudsecurity
alliance.org/guidance.
Recently, the CSA announced that it will work together with Jericho Forum 
(www.opengroup.org/jericho), an independent security expert group, 
to promote best practices for secure collaboration in the cloud. The groups 
will provide guidance on how to operate securely in the cloud. Both groups 
recently published initial guidelines for cloud computing. The Jericho Forum 

167
 Chapter 14: Setting Some Standards
published a Cloud Cube Model designed to be a tool to help businesses eval­
uate the risk and opportunity associated with moving in to the cloud. The 
paper is available at the Jericho Forum Web site at www.opengroup.org/
jericho/cloud_cube_model_v1.0.pdf.
Distributed Management 
Task Force (DMTF)
The DMTF (www.dmtf.org) has been around for about 15 years, and may 
best be known for its common information model, which is a common view 
of IT equipment. In the cloud space, it focuses on IaaS (Infrastructure as a 
Service), and providing standards that enable IaaS to be a flexible, scalable, 
high-performance infrastructure. Part of this is to try to separate the infra­
structure from the applications. Members include pretty much every major 
hardware, systems software, and networking vendor, as well as smaller com­
panies and at least 50 universities.
	
The DMTF is the group that developed the OVF standard that is formally 
known as DSP0243 Open Virtualization Format (OVF) V1.0.0. It describes an 
open, secure, and portable format for packaging and distribution of software 
that will be run in virtual machines. 
The DMTF has also launched the Open Cloud Standards Incubator, which will 
focus on standardizing interactions between cloud environments by develop­
ing cloud resource management protocols, packaging formats, and security 
mechanisms to facilitate interoperability. Of specific interest are specifica­
tions that can facilitate interoperability between public and private clouds.
National Institute of Standards 
and Technology (NIST)
NIST (www.nist.gov), which has been around since 1901, is a nonregulatory 
federal agency that is part of the U.S. Department of Commerce. Its goal is to 
promote innovation and U.S. competitiveness by advancing standards, mea­
surement science, and technology. NIST has a hand in standards everywhere, 
from the fire-related standards that your mattress had to pass to the auto 
emissions your car must (not) pass on the road.
Recently, NIST has formed a cloud computing team to help federal agen­
cies understand cloud computing and to determine the best way to secure 
those agencies implementing the technology. The team is creating a special 

168
Part III: Examining the Cloud Elements 
publication that includes information for the government agencies around 
various cloud models, security issues including application security, cloud 
monitoring, and service level agreements, among others.
Open Cloud Consortium (OCC)
The OCC (www.opencloudconsortium.org) was formed in 2008. One of its 
goals is to support the development of standards for cloud computing and 
frameworks for interoperating between clouds. Members include Cisco and 
Yahoo as well as a number of universities including Northwestern. 
The OCC has a number of working groups. Two in particular deal with cloud 
standards: 
	
✓	Working Group on Standards and Interoperability for Clouds That 
Provide On-Demand Computing Capacity: The focus for this group 
is on developing standards for interoperating clouds that provide on-
demand computing capacity. The group is developing standards for 
interoperability between storage clouds and compute clouds.
	
✓	Working Group on Information Sharing, Security, and Clouds: This 
group focuses on standards and standards-based architecture for shar­
ing information between clouds. The emphasis is on clouds belonging 
to different organizations and subject to different policies. The group is 
also examining security in the cloud.
Open Grid Forum (OGF)
The OGF (www.ogf.org) is an open community that focuses on driving the 
adoption and evolution of distributed computing. This includes everything 
from distributed high-performance computing resources to horizontally 
scaled transactional systems supporting SOA as well as the cloud. The com­
munity shares best practices and drives these best practices into standards. 
It consists of more than 400 companies in 50 countries, including AT&T and 
eBay.
The Open Cloud Computing Interface Group (OCCI), formed in 2009, is a 
working group within the OGF that focuses on the creation of an API for inter­
facing infrastructure cloud facilities. The group is looking to deliver an API 
specification for remote management of cloud infrastructure that enables 
common tasks such as provisioning and managing virtual environments. It 
will also define these infrastructure cloud services.

169
 Chapter 14: Setting Some Standards
The Object Management Group (OMG)
The OMG (www.omg.org) is an international group focused on developing 
enterprise integration standards for a wide range of industries including 
government, life sciences, and healthcare. The group provides modeling 
standards for software and other processes. These include embedded and 
specialized systems and architecture driven modernization and middleware. 
Its task forces have developed modeling standards including the Unified 
Modeling Language (UML) and Model Driven Architecture (MDA).
OMG has recently begun efforts focusing on modeling deployment of appli­
cations and services on clouds to enable interoperability, portability, and 
reuse.
Storage Networking Industry 
Association (SNIA)
The SNIA (www.snia.org) has focused for more than ten years on devel­
oping storage solution specifications and technologies, global standards, 
and storage education. This organization’s mission, according to the SNIA 
members, is “to promote acceptance, deployment, and confidence in storage-
related architectures, systems, services, and technologies, across IT and 
business communities”.
Very recently, the SNIA created the Cloud Storage Technical Work group to 
develop SNIA Architecture and best practices related to system implementa­
tion of cloud storage technology. It will act as a technical entity to help SNIA 
to identify and develop cloud standards for cloud storage. It also will pro­
duce a set of standards interface specifications and document system-level 
requirements under the guidance of the SNIA Technical Council and in coop­
eration with the SNIA Strategic Alliances Committee.
Cloud Computing Interoperability 
Forum (CCIF)
The Cloud Computing Interoperability Forum (CCIF at www.ccif.org) 
provides discussion forums to create a cloud computing ecosystem where 
organizations can work together for wider adoption of cloud computing tech­
nology and services. A major focus is on creating a framework that enables 
two or more cloud platforms to exchange information in a unified way.

170
Part III: Examining the Cloud Elements 
Some experts state that the CCIF is not a standards body, per se. Rather, 
it’s more of a discussion forum, focused on building community consensus, 
exploring emerging trends, and advocating best practices/reference architec­
tures for the purposes of standardized cloud computing.
Vertical groups
In addition to these standards groups and discussion groups, vertical industry 
groups — groups comprised of members from a particular industry such as 
technology and retail — are also beginning to look at cloud standards. 
Examples include
	
✓	Telemanagement Forum (TM Forum): This large group has more than 
700 members in 75 countries including service providers, cable and net­
work operators, software suppliers, equipment suppliers, and systems 
integrators. Its goal is to improve business effectiveness for service 
providers and their suppliers. The TM Forum serves the information, 
communications, and entertainment industries. It produces educational 
information such as industry research, road maps, best practices, train­
ing, and standards. Recently, it began working in the telecommunica­
tions initiative for cloud computing.
	
✓	Association for Retail Technology Standards (ARTS): This group is 
part of the National Retail Federation and its goal is to create an open 
environment where retailers and technology vendors can work together 
to create international retail technology standards. This includes the 
UnifiedPOS (a specification for point-of-sale, or POS, device interfaces). 
Recently, this group also started looking at researching this space and 
developing white papers to address cloud issues for this vertical.

U
sing a cloud model doesn’t mean giving away 
responsibility for your corporate assets. Security, 
governance, and standards, for example, are all critical 
aspects. In this part, we explore what it takes to manage 
the cloud.

A
ny IT manager thinking about the impact of cloud computing on the 
corporation worries about security first, second, and third. Whether 
you’re looking at creating a private cloud or leveraging a public cloud, you 
need to have a security strategy. Without a secure environment, no 
organization would dare implement cloud computing. 
	
Even if your IT organization already has a well-designed security strategy, dif­
ferent issues will surface with cloud computing. Therefore, your strategy has to 
take this different computing model into account. In fact, you want to make sure 
that your IT security strategy is lined up with your cloud security strategy. 
Cloud service providers each have their own way of managing security. They 
might be compatible with the compliance and overall security plan of your 
business. On the other hand, the security approach may conflict with 
your company’s rules. No governance body will accept the excuse that you 
simply didn’t know how your provider protected your information. In this 
chapter, we show you how your company’s information and technology 
security strategy needs to be integrated with your overall cloud computing 
strategy and plan.

Part IV: Managing the Cloud 
Putting Security on the 
Spot with Questions 
Starting with a list of issues and questions helps you to frame the way you 
understand the importance of security from a cloud computing perspective. 
	
Here are the most critical security questions to ask the potential cloud provider:
	
✓	What is the cloud provider’s security architecture and policy?
	
✓	Does the cloud provider use a third party to assess its own security risks?
	
✓	Does the cloud provider understand its responsibilities for governance 
issues (such as cross-border data transfers)?
	
✓	How comprehensive is the service level agreement between you and the 
cloud provider?
	
✓	Does the cloud provider understand your data preservation and protec­
tion needs?
	
✓	Where does your data physically live? Do you have the cloud provider’s 
assurance that it will remain private?
	
✓	Does your cloud provider separate (partition) your data, applications, 
and/or management tools from other users of its cloud services?
	
✓	Are there clear penalties for a data or system breach?
	
✓	Is data portability part of the service provided by the cloud vendor?
	
✓	Does the cloud provider have a security baseline that it promises to 
adhere to?
	
✓	Are you allowed to inspect the cloud facility?
	
✓	Does your cloud provider have well implemented patch management 
policies and procedures?
	
✓	Does the cloud provider have application level firewalls and other tools 
that help keep your application or code safe?
	
✓	Can the cloud provider keep security information such as private keys 
private?
	
✓	Does the cloud provider provide encryption and key management?
	
✓	Does the cloud provider have a well-defined, well-executed identity and 
access management architecture?
	
✓	Has single sign-on been implemented for the customers of a cloud provider?

175
 Chapter 15: Managing and Securing Cloud Services
	
You’re probably wondering if asking all these questions is necessary. It’s your 
obligation to keep your company safe. While you might be directly responsible 
for your company’s security strategy, you also need a good understanding of 
how a cloud provider might approach the topic.
But again, nothing is that straightforward. Many large enterprises are imple­
menting private or hybrid clouds, essentially transforming their data centers 
to adopt the characteristics of a self-service, scalable resource. 
	
However, even a private cloud can be a challenge for traditional security 
policies, which tend to assume a more static and controlled environment. 
Don’t think that you’re in more control of your security destiny if you have 
your own cloud. 
An IT organization must ensure the right balance of protection, privacy, gov­
ernance, and accessibility to key resources — whether in the traditional data 
center, the private cloud, or the public cloud. Security measures for monitoring 
access control, identity management, and the network need to be maintained 
in a consistent way across the internal data center and hybrid cloud environ­
ments. (See Chapter 9 for more information on private and hybrid clouds.)
	
IT security is a very complicated area of cloud computing for three reasons:
	
✓	You will be trusting your security to the cloud provider. If that provider 
hasn’t done a good job securing its own environment, you could be in 
trouble.
	
✓	IT security is difficult to monitor and problems may not be apparent 
until something goes wrong.
	
✓	Measuring the quality of a provider’s approach to security is difficult 
because many cloud providers don’t expose their infrastructure to 
customers.
Understanding Security Risks
Cloud security has to be a part of your company’s overall security strategy. 
Most companies place a high priority on the testing and monitoring of threats 
to their data center, buildings, people, and information. 
Security risks, threats, and breaches can come in so many forms and from so 
many places that many companies take a comprehensive approach to security 
management across IT and the business. For example, many companies use 
technology that tracks someone’s identity whether this person enters 

176
Part IV: Managing the Cloud 
a company building or accesses corporate information, either from within 
the company’s perimeters or from any external location. 
A company planning to secure its IT environment will generally focus on the 
broad range of potential vulnerabilities to its data center as well as ways to 
safeguard sensitive corporate, customer, and partner information wherever 
it is located. A company’s software applications may include lots of built-in 
application and data level protections (such as authentication, authoriza­
tion, and encryption), but there are many situations where these protections 
aren’t enough. The following section provides an overview of the types of 
security risks that companies should consider in any IT environment, includ­
ing the cloud. 
	
Even when cloud operators have good security (physical, network, OS, appli­
cation infrastructure), it is your company’s responsibility to protect and 
secure your applications and information.
Security services at both the application and the infrastructure level must be 
a top consideration for organizations.
Given the importance of security in the cloud environment, you might 
assume that a major cloud services provider would have a set of comprehen­
sive service level agreements for its customers. In fact, many of the standard 
agreements are intended to protect the service provider — not the customer. 
Therefore, a company really must understand the contract. 
	
The risks are lower if you’re using storage on a temporary basis than if you’re 
using a cloud service as a replacement for a critical service that touches your 
customers.
Currently, the IT industry faces a problem: Security approaches (including 
perimeter security) are becoming less effective. To understand why, you 
must know how security threats arise. About 70 percent of security breaches 
are caused by insiders (or by people getting help from insiders). Insiders 
rarely get caught. The cloud environment can have some of the same issues. 
After all, a cloud is managed by people who might be tempted to breach 
security. If your company is going to use a cloud service, you need to have a 
plan to deal with inside as well as outside threats.
	
The possibility that insiders will open a door for hackers or mount an inside 
attack makes it clear that perimeter security on its own will never be enough.

177
 Chapter 15: Managing and Securing Cloud Services
Reducing Cloud Security Breaches
Make sure that the cloud provider has taken a structured approach to its 
own security model. In general, follow these steps to reduce the risk of 
suffering security breaches:
	
1.	Authenticate all people accessing the network.
	
2.	Frame all access permissions so users have access only to the applica­
tions and data that they’ve been granted specific permission to access.
	
3.	Authenticate all software running on any computer — and all changes 
to such software.
	
	This includes software or services running in the cloud.
	
	 Your cloud provider needs to automate and authenticate software patches 
and configuration changes, as well as manage security patches in a pro­
active way. Why is this so important to understand? Many cloud service 
provider outages typically come from configuration mistakes. If a cloud pro­
vider doesn’t update security, your intellectual property could be at risk.
	
4.	Formalize the process of requesting permission to access data or 
applications.
	
	This applies to your own internal systems and the services that require 
you to put your data into the cloud.
Secure history
PCs had no security at all initially, but a 
password-and-permissions system was added 
for networkwide security based on login. In IT 
security circles, this system is called perim­
eter security because it establishes a secure 
perimeter around the network, the applications 
it runs, and the data stored within. Many of the 
security products that organizations deploy, 
such as firewalls and virtual private networks 
(VPNs, which are encrypted communication 
lines), are also perimeter-security products. 
They improve the security of the perimeter, 
which is a bit like plugging holes in the castle 
walls. With the advent of networks, however, an 
operating system could be artificially extended 
to work across a network. With virtualization of 
everything from servers to networks, storage, 
and applications, the problem gets even more 
complicated. 

178
Part IV: Managing the Cloud 
	
5.	Monitor all network activity and log all unusual activity.
	
	 In most cases, you should deploy intruder-detection technology. 
Although your cloud services provider may enable you to monitor activ­
ities on its environment, you should have an independent view. This is 
especially important for compliance.
	
6.	Log all user activity and program activity and analyze it for unexpected 
behavior.
	
7.	Encrypt, up to the point of use, all valuable data that needs extra 
protection.
	
8.	Regularly check the network for vulnerabilities in all software 
exposed to the Internet or any external users.
If you think these steps are easy, you don’t know how complex it is to imple­
ment all these rules across a large network. Very few networks come close to 
this level of protection. When you consider a cloud provider, this list will give 
insight into how sophisticated the provider is.
Point solutions usually cover specific vulnerabilities:
	
✓	Firewalls protect the internal network from the Internet. 
	
✓	Antivirus software protects individual computers against known viruses.
	
✓	VPNs protect external connections coming into the network. 
Such products reduce the risk of specific threats, but aren’t an integrated 
approach to IT security. Right now, that approach doesn’t exist outside the 
realm of government organizations such as the National Security Agency, 
and it may not exist inside such organizations, either. As the cloud services 
market matures, successful vendors will have to provide this type of 
comprehensive approach. 
But some important products can make a significant contribution to building 
an integrated IT security platform. They come in three categories:
	
✓	Identity management
	
✓	Detection and forensics
	
✓	Data encryption
We discuss these products separately in the following sections.

179
 Chapter 15: Managing and Securing Cloud Services
Implementing Identity Management
Identity management is a very broad topic that applies to most areas of the 
data center. However, it’s particularly important in protecting the cloud 
environment. Because the cloud is about sharing and virtualizing physical 
resources across many internal (and often external) users, you must know 
who has access to what services. 
	
Identity management’s primary goal is managing personal identity information 
so that access to computer resources, applications, data, and services is con­
trolled properly. Identity management is the one area of IT security that offers 
genuine benefits beyond reducing the risk of security breaches.
Benefits of identity management
Identity management helps prevent security breaches and plays a significant 
role in helping your company meet IT security compliance regulations. The 
benefits of keeping your customer or company financial data safe from unau­
thorized access can be huge. 
In addition, you reap many benefits from identity management that occurs 
every day, not just during a major threat.
	
✓	Improved user productivity: Productivity improvement comes from 
simplifying the sign-on interface (see “Single sign-on,” later in this chapter) 
and the ability to quickly change access rights. Productivity is likely to 
improve further where you provide user self-service.
	
✓	Improved customer and partner service: Customers and partners also 
benefit from a more streamlined, secure process when accessing 
applications and data. 
	
✓	Reduced help desk costs: IT help desks typically experience fewer calls 
about forgotten passwords when an identity management process is 
implemented.
	
✓	Reduced IT costs: Identity management enables automatic provisioning — 
providing or revoking users’ access rights to systems and applications. 
Provisioning happens whether you automate it or not. When provisioning 
is manual, normally it’s carried out by members of the IT operational 
staff or departmental staff. Considerable time and cost savings are 
possible when you automate the process (see “Provisioning,” later in 
this chapter).

180
Part IV: Managing the Cloud 
	
After you grasp the basics of identity management, you need to understand 
the special conditions needed for the cloud. Because the cloud is a highly dis­
tributed environment, identity management needs to be federated for you to 
benefit from the process. Federated identity management lets people keep the 
same identification across different applications, services, and networks of dif­
ferent companies. 
This eliminates some of the boundaries to access for your employees, 
customers, and partners so they can use the applications and information 
from multiple environments (including the cloud). 
Aspects of identity management
In this section, we cover the various aspects of an identity management 
program.
Corralling the data
Identity data generally is scattered around systems. Establish a common 
database or directory as a first step in gaining control of this information. 
This step involves inputting data to and gathering data from various user 
directories.
Integrating
An identity management system must integrate effectively with other applica­
tions. In particular, the system must have a direct interface to the following:
	
✓	Human resources system, where new joiners and leavers are first 
recorded 
	
✓	Supply-chain systems, if partners and suppliers use corporate systems 
	
✓	Customer databases (if customers require access to some systems), 
although customer identity management normally is handled by a 
separate component of an identity management system
Beefing up authentication
When you require authentication stronger than passwords, the identity man­
agement system must work with products that provide that authentication, 
such as biometric systems (fingerprints, handprints, iris verification, and the 
like) and identity token systems.
Provisioning
When you link all systems that use identity information, you can automate 
provisioning. If this process is automated, a single status change (of an 

181
 Chapter 15: Managing and Securing Cloud Services
employee or anyone else with access rights) can be defined in the identity 
management system and sent across all affected systems from that point.
	
When provisioning is automated, users rarely (or never) get more access than 
necessary. Providing broad levels of access happens frequently in manual 
provisioning because it’s easier to specify broad access. Additionally, an auto­
mated process never fails to revoke former employees’ access to the network.
Single sign-on
Single sign-on means providing all users an interface that validates identity as 
soon as a user signs on anywhere; this interface requires the user to enter a 
single password. Thereafter, all systems should know the user and her 
permissions.
	
Some single sign-on products don’t provide the full gamut of identity manage­
ment capabilities, but all identity management products deliver single sign-on 
capability.
Instead of being assigned to individuals, permissions are often assigned to 
roles (accounts clerk, sales assistant, programmer, and so on). Therefore, 
single sign-on also means capturing information about the administration 
hierarchy. Single sign-on naturally goes with portal technology, with the user 
having a Web-based initial interface that provides access to all applications 
that he’s entitled to access. Thus, single sign-on may need to interface with a 
portal product.
Security administration
Identity management reduces security administration costs because security 
administrators don’t have to manually authorize; the identity management 
system handles that workflow automatically. 
	
The automatic ID management handling is particularly useful for organizations 
that have distributed security administration over several locations because it 
enables security administration to be centralized.
Analyzing data 
After you centralize all user data, you can generate useful reports on 
resource and application use or carry out security audits. For example: 
	
✓	If you’re having problems with internal hacking you can check a log that 
lists every user’s activity (see the following section). 
	
✓	If you have logging software for databases and files, you can monitor who 
did what to any item of data and when, including who looked at specific 
items of data. This audit capability is important for implementing data 
privacy and data protection compliance.

182
Part IV: Managing the Cloud 
Playing Detective: Detection 
and Forensics
In this section, we discuss three specific groups of IT security products:
	
✓	Activity logs
	
✓	Host-based intrusion protection systems and network-based intrusion 
protection systems
	
✓	Data audit
	
No one — intruder or legitimate user — should be able to use the preceding 
resources without leaving evidence. You want to detect any illegitimate activity 
as soon as it happens, but in many situations, you can’t separate the legitimate 
from the illegitimate. If you don’t detect an attack while it’s happening, at least 
you have a record of what took place.
Activity logs
Many logging capabilities are included in operating systems, applications, 
databases, and devices such as hardware firewalls and network monitors. It 
costs to invoke logging capabilities: Turning on logging requires the system 
to write log records constantly, and it also involves managing and archiving 
such data until it’s no longer needed.
Log files often provide some evidence of how fraud was perpetrated, how­
ever. Perpetrators of digital fraud often escape justice simply because the 
victim doesn’t have sufficient evidence to prove what they did.
HIPS and NIPS
Companies that would like to see a cloud service provider take over their 
internal platform and infrastructure services need to take a careful look at 
infrastructure protection. 
	
Host-based intrusion protection systems (HIPS) and network-based intrusion pro­
tection systems (NIPS) are the same thing: a collection of capabilities that make 
it tough to penetrate a network. 
HIPS and NIPS can include the following elements:
	
✓	System and log-file monitors: This software looks for traces of hackers 
in log files. The monitors can watch login accounts, for example, and 

183
 Chapter 15: Managing and Securing Cloud Services
issue alerts when account permissions change — often an indication 
that something untoward is going on.
	
✓	Network intrusion-detection systems (NIDS): These security programs 
monitor data packets that travel through a network, looking for any 
telltale signs of hacker activity. The effectiveness of a NIDS depends on 
whether it can sort real dangers from harmless threats and from legiti­
mate activity. An ineffective NIDS raises too many false alarms and, thus, 
wastes time.
	
✓	Digital deception software: This software deliberately misleads anyone 
who’s attempting to attack the IT network. It can range from the simple 
spoofing of various service names to setting up traps known as honeypots 
or honeynets. (For more information, see the nearby sidebar “Fooling 
attackers by spoofing.”)
	
	Setting security traps is unusual and can be expensive. It’s normally 
done by government sites or by companies that suspect digital industrial 
espionage.
	
✓	White-listing software: This software inventories valid executable pro­
grams running on a computer and prevents any other executables from 
running. White-listing severely hampers hackers, because even if they 
access a computer, they can’t upload their own software to run on it. 
White-listing software reports on any attempt to run unauthenticated 
software. It also stops virus software stone dead.
	
✓	Unified threat management: This central function takes information 
from all the preceding components and identifies threats by analyzing 
the combined information.
Fooling attackers by spoofing
As a technical IT term, spoofing means pre­
tending to be something else. In a so-called 
phishing attack, a false Web site pretends to 
be a genuine one. A phishing Web site might 
pretend to be a bank’s Web site, for example, 
and try to tempt users to reveal their financial 
details. It’s possible to spoof email addresses 
and, under some circumstances, Internet proto­
col (IP) addresses, but mounting an attack this 
way is difficult because a computer responds 
directly to the real address rather than to the 
spoofed address.
When you use spoofing as a defense, your aim 
is to confuse attacking software. Hackers use 
sniffing software to look for servers running 
specific versions of, say, Microsoft Windows. 
If you set the operating system to give out false 
information, which is easy enough to do, that 
false information confuses the attacking soft­
ware into passing on by. Honeypots work by 
spoofing, too. They pretend to be vulnerable 
servers and thereby trick attackers into reveal­
ing details on where they’re attacking from.

184
Part IV: Managing the Cloud 
Data audit
Although databases do log the name of the individual who changed data, 
they normally don’t log who read any piece of data. But read data is easily 
stolen. If you plan on storing data in a cloud environment, you must address 
this issue. 
	
Enthusiasm for filling this gap increased considerably after the Sarbanes-Oxley 
legislation was enacted in 2002, specifically demanding that financial data be 
secured from unauthorized eyes. Consequently, a series of software products 
that log who looks at what quickly came into existence. These products gener­
ally are referred to as data audit products.
Encrypting Data
The IT world has a whole set of encryption techniques that can be regarded 
as completely safe. Thus, you can easily encrypt data and ensure that only 
the intended recipient can decrypt it.
You could encrypt everything. You could encrypt data when you write it 
to disc, when you send it down a wire, when you send it through the air by 
radio, and so on. Encrypting everything in a comprehensive way consider­
ably reduces your exposure to data theft. Hackers aren’t able to cover their 
tracks because they’re not able to decrypt the log files.
	
Encryption poses a performance penalty, so be sure to focus encryption on 
specific data that needs protection.
	
Think about how you use encryption. A fairly recent case of data theft included 
data that was encrypted until it was delivered to the application that needed 
to use it. At that point, the data was decrypted for use — and that’s exactly 
where the hacker struck. The loss could have been prevented if the receiving 
application itself had controlled the decryption on a record-by-record basis.
Because of the complexities it adds, encryption is used less frequently than 
perhaps it should be. The media have covered many cases of stolen laptops 
containing valuable data — including military secrets. Those thefts wouldn’t 
have been problems if all the data on those laptops had been encrypted 
properly.
Data encryption becomes even more important when using cloud services. 
But keep in mind that your company is still responsible for the quality and 
integrity of your information.

185
 Chapter 15: Managing and Securing Cloud Services
Creating a Cloud Security Strategy
This book isn’t Cloud Security For Dummies, so we won’t go into creating a 
comprehensive security strategy. We do want to provide some pointers, though:
	
✓	In most circumstances, approach cloud security from a risk-manage­
ment perspective. If your organization has risk-management specialists, 
involve them in cloud security planning.
	
✓	IT security monitoring has no simple key performance indicators, but be 
aware of what similar organizations spend on IT security. It also makes 
sense to keep track of time lost due to any kind of attack — a useful mea­
surement of cost that you may be able to reduce over time.
	
✓	You need identity management for many reasons, and identity manage­
ment offers many benefits. Give priority to improving identity manage­
ment if your current capability is poor.
	
✓	Try to create general awareness of security risks by educating and 
warning staff members about specific dangers. It is easy to become com­
placent, especially if you’re using a cloud service provider. However, 
threats come from within and from outside the organization.
	
✓	Regularly have external IT security consultants check your company’s IT 
security policy and IT network and the policies and practices of all your 
cloud service providers.
	
✓	Determine specific IT security policies for change management and 
patch management, and make sure that policies are well understood by 
your service management staff and by your cloud service provider.
	
✓	Stay abreast of news about IT security breaches in other companies and 
the causes of those breaches.
	
✓	Review backup and disaster-recovery systems in light of IT security. 
Apart from anything else, IT security breaches can require complete 
application recovery.
When a security breach occurs on a specific computer, the applications run­
ning on that computer will likely have to be stopped. Consequently, security 
breaches can be the direct causes of service interruptions and can contribute 
to lower service levels. Also, data theft resulting from a security breach could 
result in a real or perceived breach of customers’ trust in your organization.
	
Security is a very complex area for both internal IT organizations as well as 
the cloud service providers. Many organizations will have hybrid environ­
ments that include public as well as private clouds. Internal systems will be 
connected to cloud environments. New frontiers add complexity and risk.

Chapter 16
Governing the Cloud
In This Chapter
▶	Defining governance inside the cloud
▶	Knowing what governance to expect for your provider
▶	Knowing the risks of monitoring inside the cloud
▶	Making cloud governance work
W
hen you move a workload to the cloud, there is a good chance, depend­
ing on the kind of workload, that you’re no longer responsible for the 
care and feeding of that workload. You might move email or archived data to a 
storage cloud, for example. Wait! You turned over control of your assets to the 
cloud provider, but you’re still ultimately responsible for its wellness. In other 
words, make sure that your assets are managed in a way that meets your 
business objectives.
This is where governance comes in.
At the end of the day, governance is about making good decisions regarding 
performance predictability and requiring accountability. This is the case 
whether you’re governing your own data center or thinking about the cloud. 
We know there must be a myriad of questions in your head about governing 
in the cloud: How do I make sure that the other guy is following my rules and 
policies? When does it matter if he doesn’t follow my rules? What’s the role 
of trust in this situation?
An overarching principle behind governance is trust. All parties involved in 
the cloud — you, the cloud provider, and other service providers — must be 
able to trust that each party will do what it’s supposed to in accordance with 
established policies and procedures. Think about what would happen with­
out these policies and procedures; the cloud environment might be chaos, 
which isn’t appealing. 
In this chapter, we cover the ins and outs of cloud governance, including 
understanding the risks.

188
Part IV: Managing the Cloud 
Looking at IT Governance 
At its most basic, governance is about applying policies relating to using services. 
It’s about defining the organizing principles and rules that determine how an 
organization should behave. 
	
Did you know that the word governance derives from the Latin word for 
“steering”? It is important to have a steering process because, well, it helps 
to make sure that you stay on the road! 
Before diving in, take a step back and look at the IT governance process in 
general because many of the same principles are relevant to the cloud environ­
ment. IT manages a complex infrastructure of hardware, data, storage, and 
software environments. The data center is designed to use all assets efficiently 
while guaranteeing a certain service level to the customer. A data center has 
teams of people responsible for managing everything from the overall facility: 
workloads, hardware, data, software, and network infrastructure.
In addition to the data center itself, your organization may have remote 
facilities with technology that depends on the data center. IT management 
has long-established processes for managing and monitoring individual IT 
components, which is good. 
IT governance does the following:
	
✓	Ensures that IT assets (systems, processes, and so on) are implemented 
and used according to agreed-upon policies and procedures. 
	
✓	Ensures that these assets are properly controlled and maintained. 
	
✓	Ensures that these assets are providing value to the organization 
(actually supporting your organization’s strategy and business goals). 
IT governance, therefore, has to include the techniques and policies that 
measure and control how systems are managed. However, IT doesn’t stand 
alone in the governance process. In order for governance to be effective, 
it needs to be holistic. It is as much about organizational issues and how 
people work together to achieve business goals as it is about any technology. 
Therefore, the best kind of governance occurs when IT and the business are 
working together. 
	
Governance defines who is responsible for what and who is allowed to take 
action to fix whatever needs fixing. Governance also sets down what policies 
people are responsible for and puts in place means to determine whether 
the responsible person or group has, in fact, acted responsibly and done the 
right thing.

189
 Chapter 16: Governing the Cloud 
	
A critical part of governance is establishing organizational relationships 
between business and IT, as well as defining how people will work together 
across organizational boundaries.
How does IT governance typically work? IT governance usually involves 
establishing a board made up of business and IT representatives. The board 
creates rules and processes that the organization must follow to ensure that 
policies are being met. This might include 
	
✓	Understanding business issues such as regulatory requirements or 
funding for development
	
✓	Establishing best practices and monitoring these processes
	
✓	Responsibility for things like programming standards, proper design, 
reviewing, certifying, and monitoring applications from a technical 
perspective, and so on
A simple example of IT governance in action is making sure that IT is meeting 
its obligations in terms of computing uptime. This uptime obligation is nego­
tiated between the business and IT, based on the criticality of the application 
to the business. 
Deciding on a Governor
Cloud governance is a shared responsibility between the user of cloud 
services and the cloud provider. Understanding the boundaries of respon­
sibilities and defining an appropriate governance strategy within your orga­
nization require careful balance. You must consider many factors, ranging 
from the performance levels of the IT environment’s components to the key 
performance indicators (KPIs), which measure the effectiveness of a business 
process — of your business. Your governance strategy needs to reflect the 
mix of IT services provided by your internal data center, as well as private 
and public clouds.
	
Cloud governance requires governing your own infrastructure as well as infra­
structure that you don’t totally control. For example, your organizations must 
monitor performance across all components in a way that reflects the overall 
impact of all IT performance on the business. You may not have as much 
insight into the cloud environment, which could create challenges when you 
need to satisfy governance requirements.
Here are two examples of how governance may become more complicated 
when you add cloud services into your IT environment.

190
Part IV: Managing the Cloud 
Imagining a scenario
Say that you move some of your processing to the cloud and expect to get 
the same uptime that you had in your data center. You rely on your cloud 
provider for the availability of virtualized servers. Chances are, however, that 
you don’t have a good view into that environment. 
What do you need to be concerned about from a governance perspective?
	
✓	Can you enforce this same availability policy with your cloud provider?
	
✓	Will your cloud provider have tools that allow you to monitor whether 
service targets are being met?
	
✓	Your cloud provider may be meeting predefined service levels, but will 
the provider communicate this information to you?
Imagining another scenario
You’re developing a new application on a cloud provider’s platform. You 
expect a certain set of services to be available; in fact, you’re planning 
your development around it. 
What are some of the potential issues in this scenario?
	
✓	Does your cloud provider have a service registry or catalog that enables 
you to have good visibility into the management and availability of 
services?
	
✓	Will the services you want be available in the service catalog when you 
need them?
	
✓	Does your cloud provider have a policy for enforcing the service you 
want to be maintained and available in the service catalog?
Knowing the Risks of 
Running in the Cloud
IT governance is tightly woven with business goals and policies to ensure 
that services are optimized for customer expectations. Because IT and 
business goals are tightly woven in a governance strategy, we think it is 
important for you to also look at cloud governance from a holistic business 
perspective.

191
 Chapter 16: Governing the Cloud 
Your governance strategy needs to be supported in two key ways:
	
✓	Understanding the compliance and risk measures the business must 
follow: What does your business require to meet IT, corporate, industry, 
and government requirements? For example, can your business share 
data across country lines? These requirements would need to be supported 
through technical controls; automation and strict governance of processes, 
data, and workflows.
	
✓	Understanding the performance goals of the business: You may measure 
your business performance in terms of sales revenue, profitability, stock 
price, quality of product or service provided, and time to delivery. Your 
cloud provider must be able to support service delivery to 
optimize business performance.
Look at each of these in a bit more detail.
Understanding risk
Each industry has a set of governance principles based on its regulatory and 
competitive environment and its view of risk. There are different levels of 
risk. For example, in certain companies, information cannot be shared across 
international boundaries. In financial services, certain data practices need to 
be followed. In software development, there are risks associated with getting 
the product out in the market on time. The healthcare industry has patient 
privacy concerns. 
For example, suppose you have a corporate policy that states that no data 
from a credit card system can be used by the company’s marketing analysis 
systems. If the CIO later discovers, for example, that this information has 
been used by the system, the business is put at risk and IT governance has 
failed. Others besides the CIO needed to know that this information was not 
to be used by marketing because of privacy concerns.
Deducing IT risk
In the heterogeneous IT environment, IT needs to juggle various tasks: meet­
ing customer expectations, optimizing business goals, recognizing resource 
constraints, and adhering to rules and requirements. The cloud can further 
complicate this juggling act because it is yet another resource that IT is 
responsible for. This means that the governing body is responsible for over­
seeing the provider relationship.
Of course, the level of involvement and risk around governance might vary 
with how your organization is using the cloud. For example, the cloud can be 

192
Part IV: Managing the Cloud 
used in the following ways, each of which you must evaluate — separately — 
to determine the level of governance that your company feels comfortable with:
	
✓	For temporary computing power
	
✓	As a SaaS model
	
✓	As a platform to build a service
Risk list 
Consider these risks as you move into the cloud:
	
✓	Audit and compliance risks including issues around data jurisdiction, 
data access control, and maintaining an audit trail.
	
✓	Security risks including data integrity, data confidentiality, and privacy.
	
✓	Information risks (outside of security), including protection of 
intellectual property.
	
✓	Performance and availability risks, including availability and perfor­
mance levels that your business requires to successfully operate. This 
includes alerts, notifications, and provider business continuity plans. 
Along with this, does the provider have forensic information in case 
something does go wrong? 
	
✓	Interoperability risks, which are associated with developing a service 
that might be composed of multiple services. Will the infrastructure 
continue supporting your service? What if one of the services that 
you’re using changes? What policies are in place to ensure that you’ll 
be notified of a change?
	
✓	Contract risks associated with not reading between the lines of your 
contract. For example, who owns your data in the cloud? If the service 
goes down, how will you be compensated? What happens if the provider 
goes out of business?
	
✓	Billing risks associated with ensuring that you’re billed correctly and 
only for the resources you consume.
Remember when we said that governance was all about trust? Well, the reality 
is that, if you move into the cloud, you need to trust the cloud provider and 
every other provider that the cloud provider is working with. Currently, there 
are no professional standards or laws related to cloud computing. 
	
Managing risk can’t be emphasized enough; unlike internal IT governance where 
all parties work for the same legal entity, the cloud relationship is with an 
external provider and governance agreements need to be contractually stated.

193
 Chapter 16: Governing the Cloud 
Measuring and monitoring performance
Measuring performance as a means to help improve performance is a con­
cept that is well understood by competitive athletes. Imagine the countless 
hours spent during training measuring, recording, and monitoring changes 
in time and distance. But what if the runner were taking steroids? Was she in 
compliance? Clearly, even if all other measurements were positive, breaking 
the rules changes everything.
How does this example apply to cloud governance? 
	
Although measuring and monitoring may help you improve performance, that 
performance is irrelevant if you don’t follow the company’s governance rules.
Measurement methods
You can measure business performance by comparing production, sales, rev­
enue, stock price, and customer satisfaction with your goals. You can mea­
sure IT performance by comparing server, application, and network uptime; 
service resolution time; budgets; and project completion dates with your 
goals. Businesses use all these measures to rate their performance compared 
with that of competitors and the expectations of customers, partners, and 
shareholders. 
	
In cloud computing, you need to measure the impact of IT performance on the 
business that, by definition, now includes the performance of the cloud provider.
Of course, your own internal governance committee needs to answer the 
following questions to get started:
	
✓	How can IT performance measures support the business?
	
✓	What should management measure and monitor to ensure successful IT 
governance?
	
✓	Can customers get responses to requests in the expected amount 
of time?
	
✓	Is customer transaction data safe from unauthorized access?
	
✓	Can management get the right information at the right time?
	
✓	Can IT demonstrate to business management that your organization can 
recover from anticipated outages without damaging customer loyalty?

194
Part IV: Managing the Cloud 
	
✓	Can your company monitor systems proactively so you can make 
repairs before faulty services affect rules and regulations?
	
✓	Can you justify your IT investments to business management?
Making Governance Work
We believe that effective cloud management is accomplished partly through 
people and processes, and partly through technology. It’s really a three-part 
solution:
	
✓	Your organization needs a governance body to deal with cloud issues 
(this can be your existing governance board, if you like) and processes 
to work with the business around these issues. This board should have 
oversight and collaborate with the business (it should include business 
members as well) around cloud issues that directly impact your organiza­
tion. It can also develop best practices for managing cloud environments.
	
✓	The cloud needs governance bodies that deal with standardization 
of services and other shared infrastructure issues. Your organization 
needs some sort of interface to this group. Your level of involvement 
depends on your level of involvement in the cloud.
	
✓	Your organization needs technology that helps you automatically 
monitor what happens in the cloud.
Establishing your governance body
You need your own group of people who understand your business to deal 
with the business of the cloud. This governance board might consist of repre­
sentatives of corporate, departmental, and IT management to help encourage 
communication — the kind necessary to link IT management and the business. 
This board may also create other groups responsible for different aspects of 
governance. For example, it might create a group that needs to understand 
cloud standards, or it may leverage an IT security group.
	
Of course, an important part of this governance structure will be a group of 
individuals who actually deal with the cloud providers to negotiate terms and 
conditions and to be the point group(s) for managing the cloud provider(s). 
This governing body should be ongoing, with authority across the enterprise 
and with a mechanism for communicating business objectives and changes 
to IT management. Ideally, it will have executive-level endorsement to make 
its job easier. 

195
 Chapter 16: Governing the Cloud 
Monitoring and measuring IT 
service performance
In addition to interacting with your cloud provider(s), you must also monitor 
what these cloud providers are doing. Depending on the situation, this may 
mean investing in technology that sees into cloud operations. 
Many companies use a dashboard, which is an interface that holds the 
different services and shows how your performance measures up to your 
goals. This dashboard also needs to include information from the cloud. Quite 
a few emerging vendors provide tools that enable companies to monitor their 
cloud providers. 
Monitoring can help answer questions like these:
	
✓	What are we aiming for?
	
✓	What are our KPIs?
	
✓	How are we performing according to our established KPIs?
	
✓	How does our performance compare with last week’s or last year’s?
	
✓	Are rules and processes implemented correctly?
	
✓	Does each service meet technical standards?
Cataloging control and compliance data
Many organizations use a service catalog as a record of IT services. This 
should be extended to the cloud. The catalog can include information such as
	
✓	Whom to contact about a service
	
✓	Who has authority to change the service
	
✓	Which critical applications are related to the service
	
✓	Outages or other incidents related to the service
	
✓	Information about the relationships among services
	
✓	Documentation of all agreements between IT and the customer/service user

Chapter 17
Virtualization and the Cloud
In This Chapter
▶	Discovering virtualization
▶	Dealing with management issues
▶	Moving virtualization to the cloud
A
ny discussion of cloud computing typically begins with virtualization. 
Virtualization is using computer resources to imitate other computer 
resources or whole computers. 
We think of cloud computing as the transformation of computing that brings 
together service orientation with distributed manageability combined with the 
economies of scale from virtualization. In a world where almost everything is 
a service, virtualization is a fundamental mechanism for delivering services. 
Indeed, virtualization provides a platform for optimizing complex IT resources 
in a scalable manner (efficiently growing), which is ideal for delivering services.
When you think about cloud management, it’s important to separate resources 
from their physical implementations. Without virtualization, the cloud becomes 
very difficult to manage. Virtualization is so important for cloud computing 
because it is possible to simplify many aspects of computing. 
In this chapter, we present an overview of virtualization and how this 
process makes cloud computing work. 
Visualizing Virtualization
Virtualization separates resources and services from the underlying physical 
delivery environment. 

198
Part IV: Managing the Cloud 
Characteristics 
Virtualization has three characteristics that make it ideal for cloud computing: 
	
✓	Partitioning: In virtualization, many applications and operating systems 
(OSes) are supported in a single physical system by partitioning 
(separating) the available resources.
	
✓	Isolation: Each virtual machine is isolated from its host physical system 
and other virtualized machines. Because of this isolation, if one virtual-
instance crashes, it doesn’t affect the other virtual machines. In addition, 
data isn’t shared between one virtual container and another.
	
✓	Encapsulation: A virtual machine can be represented (and even stored) 
as a single file, so you can identify it easily based on the service it provides. 
In essence, the encapsulated process could be a business service. This 
encapsulated virtual machine can be presented to an application as a 
complete entity. Therefore, encapsulation can protect each application 
so that it doesn’t interfere with another application.
Applications
Virtualization can be applied very broadly to just about everything that you 
could imagine: 
	
✓	Memory
	
✓	Networks
	
✓	Storage
	
✓	Hardware 
	
✓	Operating systems 
	
✓	Applications
	
What makes virtualization so important for the cloud is that it decouples the 
software from the hardware. Decoupling means that software is put in a sepa­
rate container so that it’s isolated from operating systems. See Chapter 19 for 
more on this issue. 
Forms
To understand how virtualization helps with cloud computing, you must 
understand its many forms. In essence, in all cases, a resource actually 
emulates or imitates another resource. Here are some examples:
	
✓	Virtual memory: Disks have a lot more space than computer memory. 
Therefore, with virtual memory, the computer frees valuable memory space 
by placing information it doesn’t use often into disk space. PCs have 

199
 Chapter 17: Virtualization and the Cloud
virtual memory, which is a disk area that’s used like memory. Although 
disks are very slow in comparison with memory, the user may never 
notice the difference, especially if the system does a good job of manag­
ing virtual memory. The substitution works surprisingly well.
	
✓	Software: Companies have built software that can emulate a whole com­
puter. That way, 1 computer can perform as though it were actually 20 
computers. The application consolidation results can be quite significant. 
For example, you might be able to move from a data center with thousands 
of servers to one that supports as few as a couple of hundred. This reduc­
tion results in less money spent not only on computers, but also on 
power, air conditioning, maintenance, and floor space.
Using a hypervisor in virtualization
	
A hypervisor is an operating system, which means that it knows how to act as 
a traffic cop to make things happen in an orderly manner. The hypervisor sits 
at the lowest levels of the hardware environment. 
Because in cloud computing you need to support many different operating 
environments, the hypervisor becomes an ideal delivery mechanism. The 
hypervisor lets you show the same application on lots of systems without 
having to physically copy that application onto each system. One twist: 
Because of the hypervisor architecture, it can load any (or many) different 
operating system as though it were just another application. Therefore, the 
hypervisor is a very practical way of getting things virtualized quickly and 
efficiently.
Scheduling access
	
You should understand the nature of the hypervisor. It’s designed like a 
mainframe OS rather than like the Windows operating system. The hypervisor 
therefore schedules the amount of access that guest OSes have to everything 
from the CPU; to memory; to disk I/O; and to any other I/O mechanisms. With 
virtualization technology, you can set up the hypervisor to split the physical 
computer’s resources. Resources can be split 50–50 or 80–20 between two 
guest OSes, for example. Without the hypervisor, you simply can’t do that 
with Windows.
The beauty of this arrangement is that the hypervisor does all the heavy 
lifting. The guest operating system doesn’t care (or have any idea) that it’s 
running in a virtual partition; it thinks that it has a computer all to itself.

200
Part IV: Managing the Cloud 
A short history of virtualization
IBM introduced virtualization in the early 1960s 
to enable users to run more than one operat­
ing system on a mainframe. Mainframe virtual­
ization became less relevant in the 1980s and 
1990s. Indeed, in the 1990s, companies stopped 
worrying about the efficiency of the computer 
platform because computers were getting so 
powerful.
For more than a decade, IT organizations 
expanded the capabilities of their data cen­
ters by adding servers. Servers had become 
so cheap that each time a new application was 
added, it was easier to buy a new server than 
to share resources with other applications. 
Eventually, organizations realized that main­
taining, upgrading, and managing a large (and 
growing) number of servers was getting out of 
hand. The number of support-staff employees 
required to operate the data center was climb­
ing swiftly, so the manpower cost of maintain­
ing the data center (as a percentage of the total 
cost) was rising. At the same time, other costs 
were growing in an unpredicted manner, par­
ticularly the costs of electricity (to power the 
computers), air conditioning (to cool them), and 
floor space (to house them).
One of the main problems was that the serv­
ers were horribly inefficient. In the days of the 
mainframe, great efforts were made to use 100 
percent of the computer’s CPU and memory 
resources. Even under normal circumstances, 
it was possible to achieve better than 95 per­
cent utilization. On the cheap servers that IT 
departments had been deploying, however, 
CPU efficiency was often 6 percent or less — 
sometimes as low as 2 percent. Memory and 
disk input/output (I/O) usage were similarly low.
This situation seems almost insane until you 
realize that applications simply don’t require 
a great deal of resources, and with the serv­
ers that were being delivered by the year 2000, 
you didn’t put more than one application on a 
server. Why? Because the operating systems 
that almost everyone had — Windows and 
Linux, typically — can’t effectively schedule 
resource use between competing applications. 
In a competitive hardware market, vendors 
began increasing the power of servers at an 
affordable price. Most of these servers had 
more power than typical applications needed. 
The same inefficiencies of Windows and Linux 
didn’t address the efficiency problem, however. 
If an organization decided to stay with older 
but lower-powered hardware, it couldn’t find 
people to maintain those aging platforms.
If you had an application that only ever needed 
5 percent of a current CPU, what were you 
going to do other than provide it with its own 
server? Some companies actually used old PCs 
for some applications of this kind, maintaining 
the PCs themselves; but there’s a limit to the 
amount of old equipment that you can reuse.
The solution to this squandering of resources 
was to add scheduling capability to computers, 
which is precisely what one IT vendor, VMware, 
introduced. Adding scheduling changed the 
dynamics of computer optimization and set the 
stage for the modern virtualization revolution. 
The mainframe is dead; long live the mainframe!

 Chapter 17: Virtualization and the Cloud
Defining types
	
Different hypervisors support different aspects of the cloud. Hypervisors 
come in several types:
	
✓	Native hypervisors, which sit directly on the hardware platform are 
most likely used to gain better performance for individual users.
	
✓	Embedded hypervisors are integrated into a processor on a separate 
chip. Using this type of hypervisor is how a service provider gains 
performance improvements.
	
✓	Hosted hypervisors run as a distinct software layer above both the 
hardware and the OS. This type of hypervisor is useful both in private 
and public clouds to gain performance improvements. 
Abstracting hardware assets
One of the benefits of virtualization is the way that it abstracts hardware assets, 
in essence allowing a single piece of hardware to be used for multiple tasks.
The following list summarizes hardware abstraction and its management:
	
✓	File system virtualization: Virtual machines can access different file 
systems and storage resources via a common interface.
	
✓	Virtual symmetric multiprocessing: A single virtual machine can use 
multiple physical processors simultaneously and thus pretend to be a 
server cluster. It also can emulate a fairly large grid of physical servers.
	
✓	Virtual high-availability support: If a virtual machine fails, that virtual 
machine needs to automatically restart on another server.
	
✓	Distributed resource scheduler: You could think of the scheduler as 
being the super-hypervisor that manages all the other hypervisors. 
This mechanism assigns and balances computing capability dynami­
cally across a collection of hardware resources that support the virtual 
machines. Therefore, a process can be moved to a different resource 
when it becomes available.
	
✓	Virtual infrastructure client console: This console provides an interface 
that allows administrators to connect remotely to virtual center manage­
ment servers or to an individual hypervisor so that the server and the 
hypervisor can be managed manually.

202
Part IV: Managing the Cloud 
Managing Virtualization
For cloud computing to operate consistently, the service provider has to 
track all the virtualized resources. 
You must keep track of 
	
✓	Where everything is
	
✓	What everything has to accomplish 
	
✓	For what purpose
	
When managing virtualization, the service provider (whether in your own 
organization or in a private cloud) must be able to do the following: 
	
✓	Know and understand the relationships among all elements of the 
network.
	
✓	Be able to change things dynamically when elements within this universe 
change.
	
✓	Keep the placement of virtual resources in step with all the other infor­
mation held in the configuration management database (CMDB). Given 
that few organizations have anything approaching a comprehensive 
CMDB, that’s asking for a lot. In fact, the CMDB needs to know how all 
service management capabilities are integrated.
Foundational issues
Managing a virtual environment involves some foundational issues that deter­
mine how well the components function as a system. These issues include 
	
✓	How licenses are managed
	
✓	How workloads are controlled
	
✓	How the network itself is managed
In cloud environments, customers request additional add CPU cycles or stor­
age as their needs grow. They’re protected from the details, but this protection 
doesn’t happen by magic. The provider has to do a lot of work behind the scenes 
to manage this highly dynamic environment.
	
The foundations have to be in synch between the two worlds. And when your 
company reviews different cloud options, management must understand how 
the cloud provider deals with foundational issues: 

203
 Chapter 17: Virtualization and the Cloud
	
✓	License management: Many license agreements tie license fees to physi­
cal servers rather than to virtual servers. Resolve these licenses before 
using the associated software in a virtual environment. The constraints 
of such licenses may become an obstacle to efficiency.
	
✓	Service levels: Measuring, managing, and maintaining service levels 
can become more complicated simply because the environment itself is 
more complex. When cloud computing is added in to the mix, the cloud 
consumer is responsible for establishing service levels for both internally 
virtualized environments as well as those living in the cloud.
	
✓	Network management: The real target of network management becomes 
the virtual network, which may be harder to manage than the physical 
network.
	
✓	Workload administration: Set policies to determine how new resources 
can be provisioned, and under what circumstances. Before a new 
resource can be introduced, it needs to be approved by management. 
Also, the administrator has to be sure that the right security policies are 
included.
	
✓	Capacity planning: Although it’s convenient to think that all servers 
deliver roughly the same capacity, they don’t. With virtualization, 
you have more control of hardware purchases and can plan network 
resources accordingly.
Abstraction layer
Managing virtualization requires an abstraction layer that hides and manages 
things between the physical storage subsystems. The virtualization software 
needs to present the whole storage resource to the virtualized environment 
as a unified, sharable resource. That process can be more difficult than it 
sounds. 
All the administrative functions that you’d need in a physical data center 
have to be deployed in a virtualized environment, for example. Following are 
some of the most important considerations:
	
✓	A business can use virtualized storage for backup, recovery, and 
disaster recovery. Virtualized storage can reinforce or replacing existing 
backup and recovery capabilities. It can also create mirrored systems 
(duplicates of all system components) and, thus, might participate in 
disaster-recovery plans. This issue must be resolved both for internally 
virtualized environments as well as those leveraging external clouds.

204
Part IV: Managing the Cloud 
	
✓	A service provider or a business investing in its own private cloud can 
perform backups of whole virtual machines or collections of virtual 
machines in any given state as disk files. This technique is particularly 
useful in a virtualized environment after you change applications or 
complete configurations. You must test — and, therefore, simulate — 
this configuration before putting it in a production environment.
	
✓	Whether you’re a business leveraging virtualization in your own 
cloud or a service provider, you must manage the service levels of the 
applications running in a virtualized environment. The actual information 
delay from disk varies for data held locally, data held on a storage area 
network (SAN), and data held on network access storage (NAS), and the 
delay differences may matter. Test different storage options against 
service levels.
	
	For more information on SANs, see Storage Area Networks For Dummies, 
Second Edition, by Christopher Poelker and Alex Nikitin (Wiley).
	
✓	In the long run, establish capacity planning to support the likely 
growth of the resource requirement for any application (or virtual 
machine).
Provisioning software
Provisioning software lets you manually adjust the virtualized environment. 
Using provisioning software, you can create new virtual machines and modify 
existing ones to add or reduce resources. This type of provisioning is essential 
to managing workloads and to moving applications and services from one 
physical environment to another. 
	
If you’re using a cloud service provider, make sure that the company offers 
provisioning software in a consistent manner and can work with your internal 
resources. 
Provisioning software enables management to prioritize actions based on a 
company’s key performance indicators. It enables the following:
	
✓	Migration of running virtual machines from one physical server to 
another
	
✓	Automatic restart of a failed virtual machine on a separate physical 
server
	
✓	Clustering, or grouping, of virtual machines across different physical 
servers

205
 Chapter 17: Virtualization and the Cloud
	
Managing data center resources is hard under any circumstance — and even 
harder when those resources are running in virtual partitions. These managed 
resources need to provide the right level of performance, accountability, and 
predictability to users, suppliers, and customers. Virtualization must be man­
aged carefully.
Virtualizing storage
Increasingly, organizations also need to virtualize storage. This trend cur­
rently works in favor of NASes rather than SANs, because a NAS is less expen­
sive and more flexible than a SAN.
	
Because the virtualized environment has at least the same requirements as 
the traditional data center in terms of the actual amount of data stored, man­
aging virtualized storage becomes very important.
In addition to application data, virtual machine images need to be stored. 
When virtual machines aren’t in use, they’re stored as disk files that can be 
instantiated at a moment’s notice. Consequently, you need a way to centrally 
store virtual machine images.
Hardware provisioning
Before virtualization, hardware provisioning was simply a matter of commis­
sioning new hardware and configuring it to run new applications (or possibly 
repurposing hardware to run some new application).
Virtualization makes this process a little simpler in one way: You don’t have 
to link the setup of new hardware to the instantiation of a new application. 
Now you can add a server to the pool and enable it to run virtual machines. 
Thereafter, those virtual machines are ready when they’re needed. When you 
add a new application, your cloud data center administrator or your service 
provider (via a self-service interface) will enable you to configure it to run on 
a virtual machine. 
One of the key benefits that companies have found with cloud computing is 
the ability to quickly and effectively provision additional hardware resources 
from Infrastructure as a Service providers.
	
Provisioning is now the act of allocating a virtual machine to a specific server 
from a central console. Be aware of a catch, however: You can run into trouble 
if you go too far. You may decide to virtualize entire sets of applications and 
virtualize the servers that those applications are running on, for example. 

206
Part IV: Managing the Cloud 
Although you may get some optimization, you also create too many silos that 
are too hard to manage. (For more information on silos, see the nearby side­
bar, “Static versus dynamic virtualization.”) You may have optimized your 
environment so much that you have no room to accommodate peak loads.
The hypervisor (refer to “Using a hypervisor in virtualization,” earlier in this 
chapter) lets a physical server run many virtual machines at the same time. 
In a sense, one server does the work of maybe ten. That arrangement is a 
neat one, but you may not be able to shift those kinds of workloads without 
consequences. A server running 20 virtual machines, for example, may still 
have the same network connection with the same traffic limitation, which 
could act as a bottleneck. Alternatively, if all those applications use local 
disks, many of them may need to use a SAN or NAS — and that requirement 
may have performance implications.
Security issues
	
Using virtual machines complicates IT security in a big way for both companies 
running private clouds and service providers. Virtualization changes the defi­
nition of what a server is, so security is no longer trying to protect a physical 
server or collection of servers that an application runs on. Instead, it’s 
protecting virtual machines (or collections of them). 
Because most data centers support only static virtualization, it isn’t yet well 
understood what will happen during dynamic virtualization. Definite issues 
have been identified, however, and we address several of them in the following 
sections.
Network monitoring
Current network defenses are based on physical networks. In the virtualized 
environment, the network is no longer physical; its configuration can actually 
change dynamically, which makes network monitoring difficult. To fix this 
problem, you must have software products (available from companies such 
as VMWare, IBM, Hewlett-Packard, and CA) that can monitor virtual networks 
and, ultimately, dynamic virtual networks.
Hypervisors
	
Just as an OS attack is possible, a hacker can take control of a hypervisor. 
If the hacker gains control of the hypervisor, he gains control of everything 
that it controls; therefore, he could do a lot of damage. (For more details, see 
“Using a hypervisor in virtualization,” earlier in this chapter.)

207
 Chapter 17: Virtualization and the Cloud
Configuration and change management
The simple act of changing configurations or patching the software on virtual 
machines becomes much more complex if the software is locked away in vir­
tual images; in the virtual world, you no longer have a fixed static address to 
update the configuration.
Perimeter security
Providing perimeter security, such as firewalls, in a virtual environment is 
a little more complicated than in a normal network because some virtual 
servers are outside a firewall. This will be the responsibility of the service 
provider.
	
This perimeter security problem may not be too hard to solve because you 
can isolate the virtual resource spaces. This approach places a constraint on 
how provisioning is carried out, however.
Static versus dynamic virtualization
There are two types of virtualization: static and 
dynamic. Static virtualization is difficult, but the 
dynamic type is even more so.
In static virtualization, application silos become 
virtualized application silos. (A silo is an iso­
lated piece of software and hardware that can’t 
interact with other components; it’s a world 
unto itself.) You use virtualization to reduce 
the number of servers, but the virtualization 
is done via a fixed pattern that ensures that 
applications always have sufficient resources 
to manage peak workloads. This arrangement 
makes life relatively simple because that virtual 
machine will stay on the same server. Static vir­
tualization is significantly more efficient than no 
virtualization, but it doesn’t make optimal use of 
server resources.
If you want to optimize your environment, you 
need to be able to allocate server resources 
dynamically, based on changing needs within 
the business. Dynamic virtualization is complex, 
however. It’s so complex that the market cur­
rently doesn’t offer products that can imple­
ment it effectively. But those products will be 
available in time, because the virtualization cat 
is out of the bag.
Why is dynamic virtualization inevitable? The 
workloads in the data center are dynamic, 
especially considering that Internet applica­
tions change their transaction rates wildly over 
time. As the key performance requirements of 
the environment change, the virtual environ­
ment must change to meet those needs. In the 
long run, envision a world in which the whole 
network is treated as though it were a single 
resource space that can be shared dynamically 
based on changing workloads.

208
Part IV: Managing the Cloud 
Taking Virtualization into the Cloud
As we indicate earlier in this chapter, virtualization is rapidly becoming a 
requirement for managing a data center from a service-delivery perspective. 
Despite its economies , however, companies are seeking even better econo­
mies when they’re available.
If you like, you can think of cloud computing as being the next stage of devel­
opment for virtualization. The problem for the data center is that workloads 
are very mixed; the data center needs to execute internal transactional systems, 
Web transactional systems, messaging systems such as email and chat, business 
intelligence systems, document management systems, workflow systems, and so 
on. With cloud computing, you can pick your spot and focus on getting 
efficiency from a predictable workload.
From this somewhat manual approach, you can move to industrial virtual­
ization by making it a repeatable platform. This move requires forethought, 
however. What would such a platform need?
	
For this use of resources to be effective, you must implement a full-service 
management platform so that resources are safe from all forms of risk. As in 
traditional systems, the virtualized environment must be protected:
	
✓	The virtualized services offered must be secure.
	
✓	The virtualized services must be backed up and recovered as though 
they’re physical systems.
	
✓	These resources need to have workload management, workflow, provi­
sioning, and load balancing at the foundation to support the required 
type of customer experience.
Without this level of oversight, virtualization won’t deliver the cost savings 
that it promises.
Veiling virtualization from the end user
A cloud service provider (or a business with a 
private cloud) has a lot of details to manage. 
All the virtualization technology that supports 
these requirements is hidden from the end user. 
Although the business customer may expect to 
run a wide variety of software services on the 
cloud, with virtualization the business has little, 
if any, input into the how those underlying ser­
vices are managed.

Managing Desktops and 
Devices in the Cloud
In This Chapter
▶	Checking out the virtualized desktop
▶	Moving desktops to the cloud
▶	Managing desktops in the cloud
▶	Checking reality 
I
n some ways, what goes around comes around. Over the past few years, 
the notion of a virtual desktop has been getting a lot of attention. With 
a virtual desktop, the PC doesn’t run its own applications — they run on a 
server in a data center. Sound sort of familiar? And, as virtualized servers 
move into the cloud, the idea of using a virtual desktop is gaining steam. In 
this chapter, we examine what a virtual desktop is all about, what it means to 
move it into the cloud, and how to manage this environment.
Virtualizing the Desktop
	
In a virtualized desktop, the applications, data, files, and anything graphic are 
separated from the actual desktop and stored on a server in a data center (not 
on the individual machine). 
Why is it attractive? Think about a PC’s total cost of ownership (TCO): acqui­
sition, maintenance, support, help desk, hardware, software, and power. In 
a typical enterprise situation, the annual support cost per PC is anywhere 
between three and five times the cost of the PC itself. Because PCs are out­
dated after about four years, the TCO can be anywhere from 9 to 20 times the 
cost of the PC itself. 
	
Virtualizing the desktop can bring down the TCO because it helps manage and 
centralize support. Standardizing infrastructure that needs to be managed via 
virtualization makes it easier to optimize IT resources.

210
Part IV: Managing the Cloud 
Across industries
Virtualization is popular in a number of industries. For example, in healthcare, 
clinicians are using a virtualized desktop to gain access to information in 
any patient room or office. In science labs, where space is at a premium and 
contaminant-free work areas are a priority, virtualized desktops eliminate the 
server and other hardware from the room. 
Other examples include using virtualized desktops for temporary workers or 
remote workers who need access to applications, or even traders who need 
to move around the trading floor, but need to gain access to the information 
they need, when they need it. Moving the desktop into the data center covers 
every possible means of replacing physical PCs with graphics terminals (also 
known as thin clients). 
The name thin clients comes from the fact that such devices — although 
they’re computers with CPUs, memory resources, keyboards, and mice — 
aren’t PCs in the sense that they don’t have disks or DVD drives. These devices 
also run an operating system, but the OS is used only to emulate the user 
interface of a PC. The reality is that thin clients are not always that thin — they 
usually have some local memory.
The client desktop 
Virtualizing the client desktop can happen four ways, each of which is 
described in the following sections:
	
✓	Session-based computing
	
✓	Operating-system streaming
	
✓	Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI)
	
✓	PC blade
You could loosely describe every one of these techniques as client virtualization, 
because in each technique the PC is controlled from the data center (not 
from the desktop). In practice, however, only one of these techniques, VDI, 
is based on true virtualization, which is the use of software to emulate a com­
puting environment within another computer. 
	
Client virtualization involves emulating a whole PC in software on a data center 
server and displaying the user interface on a graphics terminal. 
Computers have become powerful enough to do this, and users are unlikely 
to detect the difference between client virtualization and a desktop.

211
 Chapter 18: Managing Desktops and Devices in the Cloud 
Session-based computing
In session-based computing, the user is really running a session on a server. 
The server is running a single instance of the Windows operating system with 
multiple sessions. Only the screen image is actually transmitted to the user, 
who may have a thin client or possibly an old PC. 
Products that provide this capability include Citrix MetaFrame and Microsoft 
Terminal Services.
Operating-system streaming
In this approach, the Windows OS software is passed to the client device — but 
only as much of the software that’s needed at any point in time. Technically, 
this process is called streaming. 
Some of the processing occurs on the disk and some in local memory. Thus, 
the Windows OS and its applications are split between the client and the 
server. Streaming applications run at about the same speed as reading the 
application from the disk. 
You can use this approach by using PCs on the desktop (diskless PCs and 
laptops are options) or by using thin clients. Both Citrix and Hewlett-Packard 
provide this capability.
Virtual Desktop Infrastructure
Here, virtual PCs (complete emulations of a PC) are created on the server. 
The user has what appears on the server to be a complete PC. The graphics 
are being sent to a desktop. Today, most people refer to this kind of client 
virtualization as Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI). 
VDI is the ability to have shared client sessions on the server rather than on 
the client. The software you need to use sits on the server and an image can 
be viewed on your device. It is a type of virtualization hosted on the server. 
It’s widely used and appropriate in many client environments. 
	
In the VDI model, virtual machines are defined on a back-end infrastructure. 
Users connect into their virtual desktop from various clients (thin, PC, mobile, 
and so on) through something called a connection broker. The users are really 
accessing the image of the desktop. The IT administrator simply makes a 
copy of the golden image (server image used as a template) of a desktop and 
provisions that to a user. 
VMware and Citrix both provide software that delivers this capability.

212
Part IV: Managing the Cloud 
The PC blade
A server blade is a server computer contained entirely on a single computer 
board that can be slotted into a blade cabinet — a purpose-built computer cabi­
net with a built-in power supply. The server blade can contain a number of 
PC blades.
Each user is typically associated with one PC blade — although some envi­
ronments let multiple users share one PC blade — and a whole PC sits on a 
server blade in the data center. Normally, the desktop is a thin client.
	
You can share a PC blade by putting a hypervisor (a program that enables mul­
tiple operating systems to run in conjunction with another operating system) 
on the blade. Whether or not you want to do this depends on how much CPU 
power you have and what type of applications you are running. For example, if 
you have two users who want to share a blade and both are running the same 
CPU-intensive application like Photoshop, they may not get the performance 
they were hoping for.
Putting Desktops in the Cloud
You get two big advantages to moving desktops to the cloud:
	
✓	You can create desktops at your own speed. You might first virtualize your 
desktops wherever they are, and replace them with thin clients. The 
PC blades or VDI servers (or whatever the provider uses to house your 
virtual desktops) are located at the provider’s data center. You pay the 
provider a fee for this.
	
	The average deployment time for a server in a data center is about five 
days. This includes all the setup and provisioning of the server. You might 
get five–ten virtual servers from this. If your resources are in the cloud, 
and the provider already has the infrastructure and management software 
ready for you to set up these desktops, your provisioning (adding capac­
ity at will) time might be five seconds. This means, for example, that you 
decide when you want to provision the HR department — you can do it all 
at once, or over the course of a month — it is at your own speed. 
	
✓	You can get as many resources as you need for these desktops. And, if 
the HR department needs more resources, the cloud provider has them 
ready, as well. Say you have offices in New York and Hong Kong: When 
the New York office is dark and everyone is asleep, you can use the same 
resources for Hong Kong because of the virtualization on the back end.
	
Moving an image of every desktop into a cloud environment doesn’t make 
sense: The hardware and support costs would be astronomical. 

213
 Chapter 18: Managing Desktops and Devices in the Cloud 
	
How does this work in the real world? The principle here is economies of 
scale. The idea is to move common implementations into a virtualized envi­
ronment. The golden image — a server image that’s used as a template — of 
the OS and common applications and data are housed in the virtualized servers. 
For example, it may make sense to move call center applications to this 
model. You provide a golden image of the OS and the call center support 
applications (and the data) that are used by numerous call center agents. 
The agents access this information via their thin clients. The applications 
don’t run on their desktops; they run in the cloud. This is a desktop virtual­
ization in the cloud model rather than a SaaS model because of the specific 
interface (the thin client), not the mode of accessing the application.
Further pros
	
The business advantages of desktops in the cloud are the same as in other 
forms of PC virtualization, reducing desktop ownership costs and support 
efforts in a big way. This approach also has some other advantages:
	
✓	The upfront investment is very low and transforms most client computing 
costs from fixed to variable (from capital to operating expense).
	
✓	It’s quick to deploy and easy to scale incrementally.
	
✓	It’s particularly attractive to companies that are running out of data 
center space.
Desktop as a Service (DaaS)
How can you deploy and manage these desktops? What is your window into 
this process? Recently a new class of services are being referred to Desktop 
as a Service or DaaS (not to be confused with Data as a Service, which may 
use the same acronym). DaaS removes a layer of complexity associated with 
deploying and managing VDI. 
	
The provider takes all the virtualization technology infrastructure and unifies it 
with a management front end that enables your IT to provision these desktops 
and monitor resource usage. Of course, this idea works as well in a public 
cloud as it does in a private cloud.
Two players in this space are Desktone and Virtual Bridges.

214
Part IV: Managing the Cloud 
Desktone 
Desktone (www.desktone.com) offers what it calls the Desktone Virtual-D 
Platform, which is a unified desktop virtualization platform. It actually inte­
grates discrete virtualization technology (application, network, and so on) 
and allows the whole thing to be managed from a single console. 
The platform is two tiered: 
	
✓	Enterprise: The enterprise manages the operating system, applications, 
and licensing. 
	
✓	Service provider: The physical data center infrastructure is run by service 
providers (or enterprises acting as service providers), using a VDI model. 
Desktone’s offering is based on a private cloud that will be owned and run 
by service providers (IBM and Verizon are two examples). The approach is 
intended to treat the virtual desktop as PCs connected to a service provider 
that provides the “virtual container” for the desktops. In essence, the end 
customer is responsible for their own operating system and PC application 
licenses. 
Desktone provides a virtual desktop grid — what it calls an access fabric. This 
fabric is a software service that manages desktop virtualization.
Virtual Bridges 
Virtual Bridges (www.vbridges.com) was established in 2000 to create VDI 
on Linux servers. It offers Virtual Enterprise Remote Desktop Environment 
(VERDE), which is a desktop virtualization solution for Linux and Windows 
that use VDI. 
It recently partnered with IBM and others to offer SMART, a business cloud 
computing strategy. This solution runs open standards-based email, word 
processing, spreadsheets, unified communication, social networking, and 
other software to any laptop, browser, or mobile device from a virtual desktop 
login on a Linux-based server configuration. The solutions combines VERDE 
with the Ubuntu desktop Linux OS from Canonical (www.canonical.com) 
and IBM’s collaboration and productivity software.
	
What’s the difference between desktop virtualization that runs in your data 
center and desktop virtualization that runs in a cloud? The technology is basi­
cally the same. However, the data center usually supports lots of workloads 
(lots of different applications with lots of different operating systems and 
middleware) with different requirements and much less automation. A cloud, 
on the other hand, is optimized for more specialized and fewer workloads and 

215
 Chapter 18: Managing Desktops and Devices in the Cloud 
therefore is easier to automate. Chances are you won’t run an application that 
only services 50 people in a cloud environment. Leave that for the data center.
Managing Desktops in the Cloud
From a management perspective, you should understand that cloud desk­
top virtualization doesn’t remove the need for management at the desktop. 
Additionally, you may still need to manage laptops and PCs that can’t be 
virtualized, and that task may still place a heavy demand on support.
	
In terms of managing desktops in the cloud, you need to monitor at least two 
key performance indicators (KPIs) regardless of the model you choose:
	
✓	Annual support costs per device: This metric is preferable to the total 
cost of ownership, which includes variable uncontrollable costs such as 
software licenses and device purchases.
	
✓	Availability: This metric, which measures uptime, should be close to 
100 percent with virtualized cloud desktops.
You may monitor additional KPIs, depending on your level of maturity in 
terms of your current PC management strategy. Of course, companies are at 
different levels of maturity when it comes to managing desktops. At one end 
of the spectrum, client management is fragmented and reactive; organizations 
at the other end have automated client environment management to the 
point where PC applications are provisioned and patched automatically, and 
the PC environment is centrally controlled.
	
The reality for most organizations is that the client environment is managed 
quite separately from the data center, with a separate support staff. For effi­
ciency reasons — and because the technology to enable it is improving fast — 
the management of the two domains will become more integrated in coming 
years — especially given this cloud model.
Watching four areas 
	
Even if your desktops move to the cloud, you’re still responsible for keeping 
track of your assets, as well as monitoring how your services are running. 
Your provider may be allocating disk space and dividing up bandwidth. 
Because they’re managing a large resource pool, they’ll also no doubt be 
monitoring availability.

216
Part IV: Managing the Cloud 
	
In fact, we believe you need to track at least five areas whatever your cloud 
model:
	
✓	Asset management: No matter what the client environment is (cellphone, 
BlackBerry, thin client, and so on), activities within that container need 
to be registered, monitored, and tracked; based on both the hardware 
itself, the software that runs on the platform, and how various groups 
use it.
	
✓	Service monitoring: Activities in this process area monitor what’s hap­
pening at each client, as well as the tasks required to maintain the right 
level of service. The service desk (see Chapter 17) provides coordination 
for monitoring.
	
✓	Change management: Activities in this process area involve managing 
and implementing all changes in applications and hardware. Although 
you may often be working off a golden image, this is still important. 
	
	A golden image means that every user will have the identical environ­
ment. If something goes wrong, an administrator simply gives that user 
a new copy of the same image so there is less management needed for 
each individual desktop user. 
	
✓	Security: Activities in this process area involve securing the whole client 
domain against external threats and authenticating which users can get 
into which facilities. 
	
✓	Governance: Cloud services need to be considered in connection with 
your governance strategy and your ability to comply with industry and 
government regulations (like Sarbanes-Oxley, Health Insurance Portability 
and Accountability Act, and Payment Card Industry Security Standards). 
For example, desktops in the cloud allow for all types of data to pass 
through and be stored. You need a plan to ensure continued compliance 
with regulations.
In the next few sections, we examine each of these in detail.
Managing assets
Desktop and device asset management help you select, buy, use, and main­
tain desktop hardware and software. What must you do to manage desktops 
and mobile devices thoroughly? Here’s a list of necessary activities:
	
✓	Establish a detailed hardware asset register. A register is a database that 
itemizes hardware assets and records all the details. It lets you analyze 
hardware assets (including peripherals) and provides a foundation for 
many user services, including provisioning and security. It also may be 
fed with information by asset discovery software.

217
 Chapter 18: Managing Desktops and Devices in the Cloud 
	
✓	Establish a software register. A software register tracks all the software 
elements of devices. It complements the hardware register and offers a 
foundation for better automated provisioning of software.
	
✓	Control software licenses. Even if you move your desktops to the cloud 
and have common implementations, you must manage the software 
licenses. Watching software licenses reduces costs and efforts; it also 
eliminates the risk that the company will be running more versions of 
software than it has paid for.
	
✓	Manage device costs. Often, companies have devices that are no longer 
used but that still require time and effort to maintain. By tracking 
device use, you can reduce redundancies and maintain hardware 
more efficiently. 
Monitoring services 
The support service is driven by the data center’s trouble-ticketing system, 
which tracks a problem to its resolution and quickly identifies situations in 
which the data center applications are the cause of the problem. We talk a lot 
more about monitoring in Chapter 22. 
	
Even if your desktops are running in the cloud, make sure that you can monitor 
the following:
	
✓	Application monitoring: Users are quick to blame IT when the perfor­
mance of their applications is poor. Poor performance can have a mul­
titude of causes, one of which is simply that the client device doesn’t 
have enough power. Consequently, IT must be able to monitor client 
device performance based on actual application use.
	
✓	Service-level maintenance: Service levels should be applied both to 
hardware and applications running on client devices. If service levels 
aren’t defined accurately, they can’t be monitored effectively. Service-
level maintenance becomes even more important as organizations 
virtualize the client environments.
	
✓	Automated client backup: An automated backup system reduces the 
risk of data loss and speeds recovery times when failures occur.
	
✓	Remote management and maintenance: Users may be spread around 
the country or the globe. Depending what your situation is and what 
your service provider is actually providing, find out who’s manag­
ing both client related hardware and software and if this can be done 
remotely.

218
Part IV: Managing the Cloud 
	
✓	Client recovery: Normally, this task involves restoring data from auto­
mated backups, but it also can involve reconfiguration or a software 
upgrade, depending on the diagnosis. Determine how this will be done.
	
✓	Root-cause analysis: If your desktops go down, you may want to call 
your service provider to see if something happened on their end. There 
may be some finger-pointing. On the other hand, many monitoring prod­
ucts place a software agent on the client device to capture the behavior 
of the hardware and software in real time. Simply knowing whether a 
failure is caused by hardware or software leads to faster recovery. The 
more information you can gather about CPU, memory, and application 
resource use, the easier it is to diagnose a problem.
Change management
	
Managing change means that you have to provide standardized processes for 
handling IT changes. Although cloud desktop virtualization may minimize the 
amount of change that occurs, change remains a fact of life across your 
organization. 
You should meet these key requirements for handling change management:
	
✓	Hardware provisioning: Rapid deployment of devices minimizes the 
time needed to support staff changes. New staff members have to be 
provisioned just as quickly as those leaving the organization.
	
✓	Software distribution and upgrade: Being able to distribute changed 
software to devices across the organization is mandatory in tight finan­
cial times. Many companies create a standard desktop client environ­
ment that facilitates distributing and changing software.
	
✓	Patch management: Patches are software changes that fix bugs rather 
than upgrade functionality. When well automated, patch management 
minimizes the impact of patch implementation while reducing the risk 
associated with the bugs being fixed. Many such fixes address IT secu­
rity problems.
	
✓	Configuration management: This process lets your company automate 
the configuration settings in a desktop software environment, making it 
easier to manage the client environment. Specifically, it manages which 
applications are loaded and may include IT security settings that pro­
vide or deny administrative capabilities. (See the following section.)
Security
Ensuring the security of every user access device in a company can be tough. 
We devote all of Chapter 15 to security in the cloud. 

219
 Chapter 18: Managing Desktops and Devices in the Cloud 
	
Here are some security approaches to safeguard your access devices:
	
✓	Secure access control: This approach may involve simple password pro­
tection, or it may involve more sophisticated (token-based or biometric) 
authentication. Secure access control reduces security breaches.
	
✓	Identity management: Identity management defines the user in a 
global context for the whole corporate network. It makes it possible to 
link users directly to applications or even application functions. This 
approach delivers networkwide security, associating permissions with 
roles or with individual users.
	
✓	Integrated threat management: Normally, you have to counter a variety 
of security threats through several security products, both on the client 
and in the data center:
 
• Virtual private networks secure remote communications lines for 
using virtualized desktops from home or from remote offices.
 
• Intruder-detection systems monitor network traffic to identify 
intruders.
 
• White-listing products limit which programs are allowed to run.
	
✓	Automated security policy: Ultimately, with the right processes and 
technology, you can manage some aspects of IT security to some degree 
via policy. Some products manage logging activity so that all network 
users’ activities are logged, for example. Also, you can define policies 
within identity management software to designate who has the right to 
authorize access to particular services or applications.
Getting a Reality Check
	
We would be remiss if we didn’t point out that not all PCs can be virtualized, 
much less moved to the cloud. The reality is that probably no more than 80 
percent can be virtualized. Think about your organization. 
You may find that about 50 percent of your organization uses the same sets 
of applications. These are the low-hanging fruit that could easily be virtual­
ized in a cloud environment. 
Maybe another 30 percent of your people use specialized programs: You 
might need to determine whether these programs could work in a cloud 
environment: Are there enough people using the applications? Can the appli­
cation be shared on a server? Even if you discover that all these specialized 
apps can ultimately be virtualized, that still leaves about 20 percent of appli­
cations that don’t fit the virtualization model at all.

Service Oriented Architecture 
and the Cloud
In This Chapter
▶	Understanding service oriented architecture (SOA)
▶	Defining loose coupling
▶	Finding SOA components
▶	Pairing SOA and cloud services
▶	Benefiting from SOA and the cloud
A
 cloud has some key characteristics: elasticity, self-service provision­
ing, standards based interfaces, and pay as you go. This type of func­
tionality has to be engineered into the software. To accomplish this type of 
engineering requires that the foundation for the cloud be well designed and 
well architected. 
What about cloud architecture makes this approach possible? The fact is that 
the services and structure behind the cloud should be based on a modular 
architectural approach. A modular, component-based architecture enables 
flexibility and reuse. A service oriented architecture (SOA) is what lies beneath 
this flexibility. In this chapter, we provide an overview of what SOA is and 
how it enables the characteristics of the cloud.
Defining Service Oriented Architecture
SOA is much more than a technological approach and methodology for creating 
IT systems. It’s also a business approach and methodology. Companies have 
used the principles of SOA to deepen the understanding between the business 
and IT and to help business adapt to change. 

222
Part IV: Managing the Cloud 
	
One of the key benefits of a service oriented approach is that software is 
designed to reflect best practices and business processes instead of making the 
business operate according to the rigid structure of a technical environment.
Combining the cloud and SOA
	
Cloud services benefit the business by taking the best practices and business 
process focus of SOA to the next level. These benefits apply to both cloud ser­
vice providers and cloud service users. Cloud service providers need to archi­
tect solutions by using a service-oriented approach to deliver services with 
the expected levels of elasticity and scalability. Companies that architect and 
govern business processes with reusable service-oriented components can 
more easily identify which components can be successfully moved to public 
and private clouds. 
	
A service oriented architecture (SOA) is a software architecture for building 
business applications that implement business processes or services through 
a set of loosely coupled, black-box components orchestrated to deliver a well-
defined level of service. 
This approach lets companies leverage existing assets and create new busi­
ness services that are consistent, controlled, more easily changed, and more 
easily managed. SOA is a business approach to designing efficient IT systems 
that support reuse and give the businesses the flexibility to react quickly to 
opportunities and threats. 
Characterizing SOA
The principal characteristics of SOA are described in more detail here:
	
✓	SOA is a black-box component architecture. The black box lets you 
reuse existing business applications; it simply adds a fairly simple 
adapter to them. You don’t need to know every detail of what’s inside 
each component; SOA hides the complexity whenever possible. 
	
✓	SOA components are loosely coupled. Software components are loosely 
coupled if they’re designed to interact in a standardized way that mini­
mizes dependencies. One loosely coupled component passes data to 
another component and makes a request; the second component carries 
out the request and, if necessary, passes data back to the first. Each 
component offers a small range of simple services to other components.

223
 Chapter 19: Service Oriented Architecture, Loose Coupling, and Federation 
	
	A set of loosely coupled components does the same work that software 
components in tightly structured applications used to do, but with loose 
coupling you can combine and recombine the components in a bunch 
of ways. This makes a world of difference in the ability to make changes 
easily, accurately, and quickly. (See the next section for more informa­
tion on loose coupling.)
	
✓	SOA components are orchestrated to link through business processes 
to deliver a well-defined level of service. SOA creates a simple arrange­
ment of components that, together, deliver a very complex business 
service. Simultaneously, SOA must provide acceptable service levels. 
To that end, the components ensure a dependable service level. Service 
level is tied directly to the best practices of conducting business, 
commonly referred to as business process management (BPM) — BPM 
focuses on effective design of business process and SOA allows IT to 
align with business processes.
Loosening Up on Coupling
In traditional software architecture, various software components are often 
highly dependent on each other. These software component dependencies 
make the process of application change management time consuming and 
complex. A change made to one software component may impact lots of 
other dependent software components, and if you don’t make all the right 
changes, your application (or related applications) may fail. One small change 
to an application can make its way through the whole application, wreaking 
havoc and leading to massive software code revision. 
	
Loose coupling makes it simpler to put software components together and 
pull them apart. Because they aren’t codependent, you can mix and match 
components with other component services as needed. This mix-and-match 
capability allows you to quickly create new and different applications from 
existing software services. 
For example, if a credit card–checking service is loosely coupled from an 
ecommerce application and you need to change it, you simply replace the old 
one with the new one without touching any of the other applications that use 
the service. 
An important aspect of loose coupling is that the component services and the 
plumbing (basic interaction instructions for the pieces) are separated so that 
the service itself has no code related to managing the computing environ­
ment. Because of this separation, components can come together and act as 
if they were a single, tightly coupled application. 

224
Part IV: Managing the Cloud 
	
If the notion of loose coupling sounds familiar to you, it should. It isn’t unlike 
interchangeable parts that sparked the industrial revolution. For example, 
many of the early factories used the concept of interchangeable parts to keep 
their machines running. When a part failed, they simply replaced it with another 
one. Automobile manufacturers have also used this concept. For example, the 
same steering column is used in many different car models. Some models may 
modify it, but the basic steering column doesn’t change. Because the steering 
column was designed to be used in different models, the power steering columns 
can be substituted for manual columns without alteration to the rest of the car. 
Most car manufacturers don’t view the basic steering mechanism as a significant 
differentiator or source of innovation. Likewise, a data service or an email ser­
vice are not necessarily differentiators, but they may be used to build services 
that can help companies do lots of different things.
Making SOA Happen
In this section we highlight some of the key components of a service oriented 
architecture. 
	
You can find lots more information on SOA, including the basics, technical 
details, and real-life company experiences and best practices in another 
book written by our team, Service Oriented Architecture For Dummies, Second 
Edition (Wiley).
Figure 19-1 shows the main SOA components:
	
✓	The Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) makes sure that messages get passed 
back and forth between the components of an SOA implementation.
	
✓	The SOA Registry and Repository have important reference information 
about where the SOA business services are located.
	
✓	The Business Process Orchestration Manager provides the technology 
to connect people to people, people to processes, and processes to 
processes.
	
✓	The Service Broker connects services to services, which in the end 
enables business processes to flow.
	
✓	The SOA Service Manager makes sure that the technology underneath the 
SOA environment works in a consistent, predictable way.
Each component has a role to play, both independently and with each other. 
The goal is to create an environment where all these components work 
together to improve the business process flow.

When all these component parts work together and sing the same tune, the 
result is dependable service levels. A finely tuned SOA helps guarantee service 
levels.
Catching the Enterprise Service Bus
	
In service oriented architectures, all the different pieces of software talk to 
each other by sending messages — a lot of messages. The messages are criti­
cal to delivering end-to-end services — delivery from the service provider to 
the service consumer. They must be delivered quickly, and their arrival must 
be guaranteed. If that doesn’t happen, “end-to-end service” quickly becomes 
“lack of service.”
To transport the messages between software components, SOAs typically use 
an ESB. The ESB is so important to SOA that some people think that you can’t 
have a SOA without one. Other folks think that if you have an ESB, you have 
an SOA. Neither statement is accurate. You don’t need an ESB to have an 
SOA, but you do need a way for the services to communicate with each other. 
The ESB is a reasonable, effective way to accomplish this goal. 

226
Part IV: Managing the Cloud 
The ESB is a collection of software components that manage messaging from 
one software component to another. A software component connects to 
the ESB and passes it a message by using a specified format along with the 
address of the software component that needs to receive the message. The 
ESB completes the job, getting the message from the sending component to 
the receiving component.
Telling your registry from your repository
	
The self-contained and reusable software components that you create to carry 
out your important business processes are called business services. Business ser­
vices are often made up of a group of component services, some of which may 
also have additional component services. Each service provides a function. 
Simply, here’s the difference between the repository and the registry:
	
✓	Repository: Central reference point for all the components within the 
software development environment from which services are built
	
✓	Registry: Central reference point for definitions, rules, and descriptions 
associated with every service within an SOA environment
Registry
Information describing the function of each reusable component is recorded 
in the SOA registry — a type of electronic catalog. The SOA registry has two 
roles:
	
✓	One rooted in the operational environment: In the day-to-day working 
business computing environment, the SOA registry provides reference 
information about software components that are running or available for 
use. This information is of particular importance to the service broker — 
the software in a SOA framework that brings components together by 
using the rules associated with each component.
	
✓	One rooted in the world of programmers and business analysts: For 
programmers and business analysts, on the other hand, the SOA registry 
acts as a reference that helps them select components and then connect 
them to create composite applications that represent business pro­
cesses. It also stores information about how each component connects 
to other components. In other words, the SOA registry documents the 
rules and descriptions associated with every given component.
	
The SOA registry is extremely important because it acts as the central refer­
ence point within a service oriented architecture. The SOA registry contains 
information (metadata) about all the components that the SOA supports. For 
that reason, it defines the domain of the architecture.

227
 Chapter 19: Service Oriented Architecture, Loose Coupling, and Federation 
The SOA registry is where you store definitions and other information about 
your software components so developers, business analysts, and even your 
customers and business partners can find the services they need. Business 
services are published in a registry to make them easier to find and use.
	
The idea of publishing Web services is critical to SOA. You can only reuse ser­
vices that are available for reuse, which means they have to be published first.
Repository
Comparatively, the repository is like a central reference point within the 
software development environment. It stores the source code and the linking 
information used to build all the programs that run in the operational envi­
ronment. The SOA repository feeds the service oriented architecture with 
changes and new components, working within the operational environment. 
It is the counterpart of the registry within the development environment.
Cataloging services
	
It isn’t enough to assemble all the key components and create a central refer­
ence point for your business services. You need to plan for managing those 
services; otherwise, your SOA implementation won’t meet your expectations. 
Service catalogs provide a foundation for good service management.
If you want to create, use, change, or manage a service, then you need access 
to documentation about that service. These services may include business 
services that represent a company’s important business processes and they 
may include a range of IT services such as software services, networking ser­
vices, communications services, or data services.
	
Many organizations are creating catalogs of business and IT services. These 
catalogs help companies standardize the approach to delivering and managing 
services across all units. Some organizations have merged catalogs of different 
types of services to improve their ability to manage and govern all the services 
delivered to the business. 
A service catalog should be dynamic to keep pace with the changing needs 
of the business. A sample of the information included in the service catalog 
follows:
	
✓	Whom to contact about a service
	
✓	Who has authority to change the service
	
✓	Which critical applications are related to the service
	
✓	Outages or other incidents related to the service

228
Part IV: Managing the Cloud 
	
✓	Information about the relationships among services
	
✓	Documentation of all agreements between IT and the customer or user 
of the service
A banking institution’s service catalog, for example, may have information about 
its online banking service, the key performance indicators — measurement indi­
cating the effectiveness of a process — for that service, and the service level 
agreements between IT and the online banking business. If an outage occurs, 
the bank’s IT service management team can read the service catalog to locate 
the root cause of problems with the service.
Understanding Services in the Cloud
When you have some of the background on what it means to take a service- 
oriented approach to architecting technology systems, you can begin to see 
the relationship between SOA and cloud computing. Services are important for 
cloud computing from both an infrastructure and an application perspective. 
Service orientation permeates the cloud itself and the cloud serves as an 
environment that can host other services (either at technical or business 
levels). What does this mean? 
	
✓	On the one hand, cloud providers have built the cloud infrastructure on 
well-designed services with clearly defined black-box interfaces. These 
black-box services (think capacity, for example) allow the cloud to scale. 
The cloud infrastructure itself is service oriented.
	
✓	On the other hand, companies building applications designed for the 
cloud tend to build them out as services; this makes it easier for custom­
ers and partners to use them. For example, Software as a Service provid­
ers need an ecosystem of partners that provides either complementary 
components or full applications that are important to sustaining and 
growing their businesses. A service oriented architecture is the only way 
partners can economically build on these platforms. 
In Part III of this book, we introduce you to the various elements of the cloud 
and describe the different cloud models — Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), 
Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). We illustrate 
how each of these models exhibits some important characteristics, like elas­
ticity and self-service provisioning. 
Look at each of these models again so that you can understand why smart 
cloud providers are using a services approach.

229
 Chapter 19: Service Oriented Architecture, Loose Coupling, and Federation 
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
	
The Infrastructure as a Service layer offers storage and compute resources 
that developers and IT organizations can use to deliver custom business solu­
tions. A cloud provider wants the provisioning capability associated with the 
IaaS to be designed as a modular service with published interfaces so it can be 
used for many different situations. 
Say you have a group of applications that you want to run in a public cloud 
because you want capacity on demand. You sign up with an IaaS provider. 
Via your Web browser, you can buy this capacity and start running your 
applications on the service. The service is provisioning the capacity. While 
you’re running the application, the service provisions hardware to run it and 
then de-provisions the virtualized servers when you’re done. 
	
As a user of this capacity provisioning service, you don’t need to know how 
the provider is making the service happen; it is a black box to you. If the cloud 
weren’t service oriented, you’d have to figure out how to provision your appli­
cation to the environment. With the cloud, you can use a single provisioning 
service. 
Platform as a Service (PaaS)
The Platform as a Service layer offers development environments that IT 
organizations can use to create cloud-ready business applications. This is 
offered as a set of black-box services that lets developers build applications 
on top of the compute infrastructure. This might include developer tools that 
are offered as a service to build services, or even data access and database 
services, or even billing services. 
In these situations, the principles of SOA (such as loose coupling and reus­
ability) have been applied to IT infrastructure components that are delivered 
as cloud services to PaaS users. Developers in your organization may locate 
the platform services they need by referencing a service catalog. 
Software as a Service (SaaS)
	
With Software as a Service, the provider hosts the software for you so you 
don’t need to install it, manage it, or buy hardware for it. All you have to do is 
connect to it and use it. 
For example, you might make use of CRM as a service or accounting as a service. 
Many of these providers have created their services in a modular way to 
enable scalability (because you’re using these services along with perhaps 
thousands of other clients). A services-oriented approach allows the provider, 
for example, to swap out functionality easily. 

230
Part IV: Managing the Cloud 
	
Don’t confuse SOA with SaaS. SOA is software designed as a service; SaaS is 
software managed and distributed as a service. 
In all these models, companies will use a set of well-defined services that 
they can access through interfaces. Companies can leverage these services in 
many different ways depending on what problems they are trying to solve.
	
Are all cloud providers totally committed to a SOA? Probably not. But any 
smart cloud provider wants to make sure that it can change and modify its 
offering to solve your problems. Service orientation is the most pragmatic way 
to achieve that goal.
Serving the Business with SOA and 
Cloud Computing 
Bringing IT and the business together to find ways to use technology to serve 
the needs of the business is a core concept for both service oriented archi­
tecture and cloud computing. SOA is a business and technical approach used 
to architect your company’s business process as reusable, inter-changeable, 
black-box software components. Cloud computing is about delivering IT infra­
structure (not just software, but hardware, storage, and IT services too) as 
efficient and reusable services according to the needs of the business. 
Concepts like reusability and loose coupling that are central to SOA are also 
integral to the scalability of cloud services. The use of reusable and loosely 
coupled components makes scalability and elasticity a reality for cloud service 
providers. And, consider what might happen in the not-too-distant future. Say 
you have built a private cloud that deals with some of your company’s applica­
tions and data, but you’re using a public cloud for some other applications. 
You don’t want these applications to be stove piped. They need to act together. 
If there are well-defined interfaces that enable you to share data, for example, 
between these applications (no matter where they are) you will be well served. If 
you are working with vendors where the platform has lots of dependencies that 
will lock you in, you will not be able to gain the business advantages you expect.
Companies benefit from SOA and the cloud because both of these approaches 
place a priority on understanding what the business needs, when it needs it, 
and how efficiently and cost effectively the business can be served.

W
hen you deploy applications on your own premises, you can control 
your resources and you (hopefully) know who’s responsible for 
maintaining the integrity of the overall environment. When you move some of 
your computing to a cloud environment, the way you think about managing 
changes dramatically. 
You need to find the right balance between the oversight you must provide 
to internal customers and the way you monitor your cloud provider. We expect 
that many companies will have a combination of on-premise data centers 
combined with some cloud-based services. Therefore, you have to juggle a 
variety of management approaches. 
Whatever path you choose, one thing is clear: You do not relinquish authority 
at the door. You need a consistent view across both on-premise and cloud-
based environments. You need to make sure that you understand how the 
provider is going to support what you’re doing in the cloud, whether it’s com­
puting capability, building your own applications, or using another provider’s 
applications.
When you begin to leverage cloud services, you must have a clear under­
standing of how that resource will be managed by that provider. The com­
pany you have partnered with has to manage the underlying infrastructure 
that you’re using (along with its multitude of other customers). This includes 
the physical servers, networks, and storage, as well as any virtual servers. 
Someone also has to manage the databases and applications that are running 
on top of this infrastructure. That’s a lot of managing — and for the most 
part, you’re not in control.

232
Part IV: Managing the Cloud 
The cloud is a complex environment and many parties may be part of the cloud 
service delivery model. These parties may include the cloud infrastructure 
provider, a SaaS provider, and your own set of developers and delivery team. 
	
Managing this hybrid environment, in some ways, is in its infancy. Therefore, 
it’s important to have a good understanding of the issues and questions you 
should present to your cloud partners before starting your migration. 
Managing the Cloud
Chapter 2 introduces a simple model of cloud computing that has three models: 
	
✓	Infrastructure as a Service
	
✓	Platform as a Service
	
✓	Software as a Service 
All are surrounded by a management layer, as you can see in Figure 20-1.
We mention that the management layer is where life in the cloud can get 
very complicated. It’s simple enough to describe how to use some kind of 
cloud computing service, but you also have to integrate cloud oversight and 
management into the company’s IT operations; that isn’t necessarily a simple 
thing to do. 
	
The point is that when you look at managing the cloud environment, you need 
to consider this from the point of view of the service provider(s) and the end 
customer.
There are many dimensions involved in managing a cloud. If you’re a service 
provider, for example, you have to think about the different types of custom­
ers that will be using the cloud. One might be using the cloud as a commer­
cial platform while another might be a single business user. Obviously, the 
customer using the cloud for commercial uses needs to understand the pro­
vider’s management approach; the business user also has to understand the 
provider’s approach. 
The following sections look at what this means.
The service provider
Many types of cloud service providers are required to provide management 
services. The cloud provider has to make sure that it has a well-designed 
management infrastructure so that all of its services operate efficiently and 

233
 Chapter 20: Managing the Cloud Environment 
safely. Unlike a traditional data center, the cloud service provider has to 
manage both virtual as well as physical components. The provider has to make 
sure that each customer’s data is well protected and supported. When the 
provider has done a good job, you may be unaware of it. This is something 
the customer rarely ever sees.

Managing based on services
Management service types depend on the type of cloud service the vendor 
provides. For example: 
	
✓	A vendor providing cheap storage may not necessarily have a 
sophisticated set of management services. 
	
✓	Another provider might have different levels of customer support and 
may act more like an outsourced service provider. 
Managing several cloud providers 
You may end up working with several different cloud providers — one for a 
Software as a Service (SaaS) application and another for Infrastructure as a 
Service (IaaS), for instance. Although each vendor will have its own manage­
ment services, your organization is responsible for oversight.
Here’s a simple scenario that drives home this point: Assume you have con­
tracted with a SaaS service to manage your sales leads. This company doesn’t 
have its own cloud center, so they contract an IaaS provider. When something 
goes wrong, it may be tough to figure out the source. If you’re the customer 
using the SaaS application, you’ll call your provider. How sophisticated is their 
service management system? Can they quickly trace the cause of the problem? 
It may be harder than it seems. For example, the problem might occur because 
the platform provider just upgraded to a new version of an operating system 

234
Part IV: Managing the Cloud 
and forgot to upgrade a script or a component. The problem may be a 
power outage. 
	
Many companies today are using emerging cloud providers that offer very 
inexpensive, or even free, services. While this can dramatically improve your 
bottom line, it may also cause problems. What happens when your free service 
quits working? Some free (or nearly so) services provide online service status 
updates, but many do not.
	
Many of these issues related to service levels and oversight in the cloud are a 
function of the relative immaturity of the cloud market itself. It may be hard to 
assess how sophisticated the service management environment of a specific 
cloud provider is. In fact, you’ll likely sign up with a SaaS provider without 
knowing anything about the way it manages its own environment. However, 
this may be one of the most important questions to ask — especially if you’re 
dependent on the application.
Customers
If you’re a business manager using a cloud provider, you need visibility into 
both the computing infrastructure and the applications you’re using in the 
cloud. You need to understand some key factors so you can manage both 
your cloud-based services as well as your own data center. (Read more about 
this topic in the “Gaining Visibility” section later in this chapter.)
From an overall management perspective, you need to at least be able to do 
what’s described in the following sections.
Provision resources in the cloud
If you’re using a public or private cloud, you need a mechanism that enables 
you to provision new resources when you need them. Can this be auto­
mated, or does someone have to manually do it? This administrative function 
includes setting up your cloud environment as well as building and deploying 
applications in the cloud. This administrative process will be needed regard­
less of whether you’re using a public or a private cloud. 
It is also true, in a slightly different way, in the SaaS environment. The service 
provider manages the performance levels of the overall environment that 
might require the addition of servers, increasing processing power, and so 
on in a compute environment. It may include provisioning a database or map­
ping your data to your new cloud application.

235
 Chapter 20: Managing the Cloud Environment 
Deal with incidents and problems
When your organization begins adopting some cloud computing capabilities, you 
must have a plan to handle problems such as unexpected outages. Although 
the cloud computing vendor will have its own infrastructure and tools for 
this, you have to be proactive too. Know how your provider handles changes 
to its environment. 
Depending on how critical the cloud service is to your business, you have 
different levels of support. For example, if you’re a large corporation using 
a cloud service for all your company’s email services, you probably want to 
establish a plan with your provider for direct support to handle problems. 
	
Work with your cloud provider if you’re dependent on these services to run 
your business. You need to have a process for handling incidents and prob­
lems. You also need to explain to your management what happens if and when 
a service fails.
Monitor and measure
Of course, you want to make sure that you can see the performance level of 
the services in the cloud. This monitoring should be incorporated into your 
overall capacity plan for your company. 
You really need these things overall: 
	
✓	A dashboard that provides you with insights across the applications and 
services that are running in your data center and those that are running 
in a cloud.
	
✓	A service level agreement across your own services and those provided 
by cloud providers to get a true picture of the service you are providing 
to your company.
Bill and other services
All cloud providers will bill your company based on one of the following:
	
✓	How many users are supported
	
✓	How much capacity you use
	
✓	How many services you leverage
As with any service you purchase, it is important that you have oversight. 
You should be able to “see into” your billing, especially if you’re automati­
cally provisioning capacity. Most service providers will provide customers 
with an application that will include information about what resources they 
are being charged for. If the service provider can’t provide this accounting 
information, something is wrong. 

236
Part IV: Managing the Cloud 
Hybrid environments
Your company will probably have a hybrid environment: a traditional data 
center, a private cloud, and some cloud services. That hybrid is part of what 
makes cloud management so complex. They may use virtualized servers as 
well as dedicated physical servers. 
Chapter 17 defines virtualization as using computer resources to imitate 
other computer resources or even whole computers. The term is very broad 
and can include virtualizing everything from memory to software, but we 
keep it simple for right now.
This hybrid environment requires management of both the virtual servers and 
the physical infrastructure beneath. And, because there is a good chance that 
most enterprises won’t move all of their computing resources to the cloud, 
they have to be concerned with how this hybrid environment gets managed. 
Two important capabilities need to be in place to manage this hybrid world: 
the service catalog and the Configuration Management Database (CMBD).
The service catalog
One of the important factors in managing a cloud is to ensure a way to 
manage IT assets and activities. Enter the service catalog (defined as part of 
the Information Technology Infrastructure Library [ITIL] Service Design best 
practice). The catalog is a component list that makes up internal and external 
services that are available to an organization. 
A typical service catalog includes such items as the definition of the service, 
its service level, who is entitled to use that service, and what components 
are required to execute that service. Clearly, a service catalog is required for 
organizations to manage services in a hybrid world — across data centers, pri­
vate and public clouds, as well as hosted environments. The service catalog 
is an essential tool for both cloud providers and customers that need a view 
into the assets they are using. Many cloud providers package a service cata­
log to help their customers work between their cloud and external resources.
The Configuration Management Database (CMDB)
To understand what services are being managed across your various com­
puting environments, you should keep track of changes. That is the role of 
the Configuration Management Database (CMDB). For example, many cloud 
environments use extensive virtualization to add efficiency. Virtualization 
enables the abstraction of hardware assets so that these assets can be used 
for multiple purposes. These varied uses increase the difficulty of tracking 
changes to these resources. However, it’s important for the cloud provider 
(even if that’s you in your private cloud) to track these assets and under­
stand what’s been changed and what state that service is in. 

237
 Chapter 20: Managing the Cloud Environment 
	
The CMDB will evolve into an important capability because it ensures that 
cloud services don’t fail because of an inadvertent configuration change.
	
Often, when vendors talk about managing the cloud, they’re only talking about 
how you manage resources over a virtualized infrastructure — about a self-
service portal that lets you provision resources and some sort of automated 
resource allocation. They’re not talking about fixing problems, providing ser­
vice level agreements, or managing security. 
Building Up Support Desks
One of the fundamental truths of managing services is that when you do it 
well, the service management team is like the wizard behind the curtain in the 
Land of Oz. If your email never goes down and your technical equipment never 
fails, you don’t go looking behind the curtain to understand what went wrong.
The reality is that services do fail and errors do occur — and when they do, 
customers (or service users) need questions answered and problems resolved. 
Whatever a problem is, it must be reported, diagnosed, evaluated, and fixed 
quickly. One critical component of this equation is the service desk. If your 
cloud provider doesn’t have one, you need to ask, “Why not?”
	
For many businesses, the service desk is the first port of call when there is an 
incident or a problem. Imagine the lost productivity and revenue (and the all-
around chaos) that would occur in the cloud if your provider couldn’t manage 
service delivery and deal with problems effectively. The service desk does this.
Service desk goals
A service desk provides a single point of contact for IT users and customers 
to report any issues they may have with the service. It generally has three goals:
	
✓	Problem resolution: First and foremost, the desk is there to help resolve 
issues as quickly as possible. This task involves 
 
• Recognizing and resolving relatively simple issues 
 
• Prioritizing problems that may have a greater impact
	
	An outage in the cloud that provides corporate email services, for 
example, may take higher priority than a free service to consumers. 

238
Part IV: Managing the Cloud 
	
✓	Service restoration: The desk works to restore service as quickly as 
possible to maintain service level agreements (which require a lot of 
negotiation). Therefore, a key service desk role is ensuring that the 
agreements are enforced to the best of the company’s ability, which 
means tracking and monitoring service levels.
	
✓	System support: The service desk provides system support, which 
includes dealing with any server incidents (and may also mean dealing 
with issues such as change and configuration management).
Varying support levels
Your own data center will obviously provide a service desk, but does your 
cloud provider offer service support? It should. 
However, providers offer different levels of support: 
	
✓	Basic support might mean a two-day response time via a Web-based 
portal where you ask your question. 
	
✓	It might also simply mean access to a Web-based community. 
	
✓	A premium package may get you a two-hour response time, but no guar­
antees about service levels. 
	
✓	Some providers state that they will provide a one-hour response time for 
“urgent” issues, but don’t specify what urgent actually means. 
	
Keep this in mind: If you can’t find any support information on a cloud 
provider’s Web site, there is a good chance that you won’t get any.
Examining support services
Although cloud management is still evolving, some cloud providers have a 
service desk in place to support customers. Many service desks deal with 
issues beyond incident and problem reporting, such as change management, 
customization, and so on. A service desk can provide many services. What 
about your cloud provider? 
Depending on the level of service required for a cloud service, you might 
need to ask about some of these services.
Communication via multiple channels
Does your provider support a wide variety of communication styles, includ­
ing phone, email, online forms, and even mobile communications? 

239
 Chapter 20: Managing the Cloud Environment 
This communication is a two-way street: People can use the channels to 
report issues, and the provider can use the channels to notify customers 
about the status and resolution of issues. This means that you might receive 
proactive communications from your provider if there is a problem. Or, you 
could receive notification when problems will be fixed.
Incident and problem management
The service desk should support the assessment, prioritization, resolution, 
notification, and reporting of small incidents or major problems. An incident 
becomes a problem when it happens more than a few times. 
Management includes recording, routing, and resolving an issue; notify­
ing interested parties of the status of the issue; and reporting on the issue. 
Although some of these might seem like remote possibilities, these types 
of problems do happen and often cause the most serious outages. Ask your 
cloud provider how they deal with the following issues:
	
✓	Configuration management: Someone made an error while changing 
a configuration.
	
✓	Network: The network gets overloaded.
	
✓	Database: A database table needs to be optimized.
	
✓	System management: A server’s processors failed and the failover didn’t 
work.
	
✓	IT security: A denial-of-service attack is in progress.
	
✓	Application: A program has a bug.
	
When you decide to go with a cloud provider, make sure that the proper level 
of support is there for you. 
Change management
Suppose you want to customize your application or need some other type 
of support. The service desk should support the management of change 
requests, including information about how system parts interact. Often, the 
provider will include some support for customization in the contract. This 
might consist of one-on-one interactions with someone on the cloud staff. 
You need to find out.
Knowledge base
If service desk personnel don’t have the right information to do their jobs, 
their jobs won’t get done well. Knowledge management ensures that people 
get the information they need to do their jobs correctly. Service manage­
ment systems often link to a database for past incidents and how they were 
resolved; this database speeds incident resolution.

240
Part IV: Managing the Cloud 
Configuration management
The desk should support mapping resources to the business processes 
that they support. Configuration management often entails a Configuration 
Management Database (CMDB) or some other kind of data store for holding 
all the cloud data center assets.
Gaining Visibility
At a minimum, you need to be able to see into these arenas in the cloud: 
	
✓	Security
	
✓	Performance
	
✓	Service availability 
Your dashboard should give visibility into those services that you are using on 
a regular basis. Ideally, you want a dashboard that gives you uniform visibility 
across your own resources and those of your cloud and hosting providers. 
You should track security, performance levels, and service availability, all of 
which are discussed.
Monitoring securitySecurity is important whether you’re consuming IaaS 
(Infrastructure as a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service), or SaaS (Software 
as a Service), cloud services. To monitor security, you need to 
	
✓	Scan networks
	
✓	Scan operating systems
Google this
Google provides an application status dash­
board called the Google Apps Status Dashboard 
(google.com/appsstatus#). Customers 
can use this Status Dashboard to check on cur­
rent Google services such as email, calendar, 
chat functions, word processing, spreadsheets 
and presentation software, and video. The 
dashboard shows the status of each of these 
applications, by day. If a problem occurs, infor­
mation about that problem is on the dashboard. 
Overall service metrics (such as the down­
time or disruption for each application type by 
month) aren’t presented. However, in this case, 
you get what you pay for (which is nothing, in 
the case of many of these free services).

241
 Chapter 20: Managing the Cloud Environment 
	
✓	Scan applications 
	
✓	Perform some sort of testing
For example, at the IaaS level, you need to validate appropriate levels of net­
work, operating system, and middleware security to prevent intrusion and 
denial-of-service attacks. Please refer to Chapter 15 for more information on 
managing security in the cloud.
Ensuring adequate performance levels
	
Make sure that the cloud’s performance doesn’t go below the agreed-upon 
service level. To see into this aspect, you might use a tool that tests for 
	
✓	Bandwidth
	
✓	Connectivity
	
✓	Scalability
	
✓	Quality of end-user experience across your cloud services
Monitoring service availability
You need a tool that can help you determine the availability of your services. 
You can use this tool to monitor whether your cloud network is up or down 
and if your provider is meeting its service level agreements. (See the next 
section for more on SLAs.)
Tracking Service Level Agreements
A service level agreement (SLA) is a contractural obligation between you and 
your cloud provider. Negotiating SLAs is often a dance between IT and the 
provider. 
	
Some service levels are nonnegotiable, such as a mission-critical application. 
By nonnegotiable we mean that if that application needs to be available except 
for one hour per month, you can’t agree to a compromise. If that’s the case 
and the provider can’t meet the service level, you should reconsider the cloud 
option. Other SLAs have more wiggle room.

242
Part IV: Managing the Cloud 
	
IT and the service provider must work together to establish these SLAs. 
Typical SLAs include the following:
	
✓	Response times (possibly varying by transaction)
	
✓	Availability on any given day
	
✓	Overall uptime target
	
✓	Agreed-on response times and procedures in the event a service goes down
The agreement theoretically gives you some assurance that the provider will 
meet certain service levels. 
	
But, buyer beware! You need to determine the following:
	
✓	Downtime: Depending on how critical your applications running in a 
cloud are, you will need a certain level of availability. Is 99.9 percent enough 
for you? Or, do you require five nines? How does the provider plan to 
ensure that it will meet its SLA? What failover and disaster recovery mecha­
nisms does the provider have in place? Are you comfortable with them? 
	
	You need to read the fine print. Does the SLA include planned maintenance, 
or is that separate? If so, how does planned maintenance affect you?
	
✓	How the lines of responsibility are drawn: You don’t want to be in a sit­
uation where the SaaS provider is pointing a finger at the infrastructure 
provider, saying it wasn’t their fault.
	
✓	Cost of downtime: What does it mean to your operations if the cloud is 
down? Service providers might compensate simply based on the number 
of hours systems are down. What about the cost to your business?
	
✓	Past incidents: Has your provider struggled with excessive downtime in 
the past? Check the record. Also look at service desk metrics, including
 
• Time to identify problem: Did a problem exist for a long time 
before it was reported? Is performance varying widely without 
warning? If this is true, it means that the monitoring system isn’t 
performing well and should be reviewed. 
 
• Time to diagnose: Time between an event report and the 
identification of the cause of the problem.
 
• Time to fix: Time between diagnosis and system repair or 
resumption of service.
Ideally, you can see the operations of your service provider. 
The SLA information you should capture from your provider is part of the 
overall key performance indicators (KPIs) for your company. 

Part V
Planning for the 
Cloud

In this part . . .
T
here’s more to cloud computing than technology. 
Planning is a critical part of any cloud computing 
endeavor. In this part, we look at economics and suggest 
some ways of starting your cloud journey.

Chapter 21
Banking on Cloud Economics 
In This Chapter
▶	Exploring the allure of the cloud
▶	Discovering the economics of the data center
▶	Checking out some interesting ratios
W
hen company management begins thinking about implementing a 
cloud, the first thing they think about is the economic impact. In 
other words, if somehow I can get rid of my data center and move to a cloud, 
all my financial problems are over! Like everything else in life, it isn’t that 
simple. 
	
Many issues come into perspective when you’re evaluating the economics of 
the cloud: 
	
✓	The data center itself isn’t static; it changes constantly. 
	
✓	Not every workload is more economical in the cloud. 
	
✓	Emerging technologies make some decisions more complicated. 
In this chapter, we discuss the cloud from an economic perspective. 
$eeing the Cloud’s Allure
Cloud computing capabilities aren’t easily replicated in the traditional data 
center. Cloud computing can easily handle the following types of situations: 
	
✓	Your organization is ramping up for a new but short-term initiative and 
you temporarily need some extra CPU capacity and extra storage.
	
✓	You’re a startup and want to create an online presence without spend­
ing money on hardware or software, so you use a cloud-based platform 
to get started.

246
Part V: Planning for the Cloud 
	
✓	You decide that running sales automation is much simpler with a 
Software as a Service solution. (See Chapter 12 for more about Software 
as a Service.)
	
✓	You’re changing your email system and decide that selecting a mas­
sively scaled application service in the cloud makes sense.
	
In the next few sections, we take a look at each of these scenarios from an eco­
nomic perspective. We examine the economic justification for each of these in 
the context of the data center.
Filling the need for capacity
Some pragmatic workloads fit perfectly into the Infrastructure as a Service 
(IaaS) model. Include basic computing services to support unexpected work­
loads or test and development requirements. Economically, organizations 
can access what they need right away, without having to buy new hardware 
or go through the long process of manual provisioning. 
What does this mean in practical terms?
	
✓	Software evaluation: Testing new software is both a cumbersome and 
long-lived process. Typically developers need to acquire servers and 
specialized development software. While this is a necessary process, 
it doesn’t add to the bottom line of revenue. It is overhead. Therefore, 
offloading is likely to be inexpensive because it’s fairly infrequent.
	
✓	System testing: Similar to software evaluation, resources are required for a 
relatively short time. Despite that, testers typically want to own their own 
resources, which isn’t cost effective. In addition, if someone is testing a 
fast-growing workload, they have to spend massive amounts of money to 
achieve the same thing that they can via a service for a fraction of the cost. 
	
✓	Seasonal or peak loading: Some companies are already using IaaS for 
the unexpected or planned high-load periods. The flexibility of using 
IaaS means that the company doesn’t have to overinvest in hardware. 
These companies must be able to adapt to higher loads to protect their 
companies. 
Getting the work done without 
capital investment
Only a few opportunities to take advantage of PaaS are tactical. Some PaaS 
operations are doing little more than providing an open-source Internet soft­
ware stack and development environment; therefore, migrating to such an 
environment might be possible without much disruption. 

247
 Chapter 21: Banking on Cloud Economics 
	
If the developers have enough experience, they can use this free resource to 
develop applications with a PaaS approach. This saves a lot of money for 
experienced teams.
Organizations may decide to use a platform to create software for a spe­
cial project between collaborators that will go away when the project is 
finished. Some organizations simply want to get started without additional 
capital expenses. However, in large organizations, there are usually multiple 
development environments, and moving strategic parts of the development 
environment into the cloud is likely to be a complex decision rather than a 
tactical one. 
In this situation, organizations have to make a decision by looking at both 
initial costs and long-term support. A pure open-source PaaS provides great 
economic value, but in the long run other costs appear (in terms of develop­
ment and support).
Selecting a SaaS for common applications
The ease with which SaaS offerings can be adopted varies. If the application 
is fairly independent of the overall applications and information environment 
of the company, SaaS is a tactical and pragmatic approach. And because 
many of the SaaS vendors publish their interfaces, some applications can be 
used in conjunction with SaaS offerings. Also, SaaS has enormous benefit for 
organizations that don’t want to support their own hardware and support 
environment. 
Selecting the massively scaled application
	
Some of the earliest cloud adopters are large companies that want to take 
a massively scaled application (such as email) and put it into a cloud. 
Companies are finding that a more cost-effective approach. In essence, this is 
the type of application of the cloud where the economics can’t be matched by 
the data center. When applications support this type of massively scaled infra­
structure, the cloud will often win out. For more about massive scaling, see 
Chapter 13.
When it’s not black and white
Not all situations are clear cut. Accurately forecasting the economics of the 
cloud versus the data center is complicated. The problem for many organiza­
tions will be that they do not have an accurate model of data center costs 
that allows them to consider cloud propositions on an apples-to-apples basis.

248
Part V: Planning for the Cloud 
Creating an Economic Model 
of the Data Center
It’s hard for most organizations to accurately predict the actual costs of running 
any given application in the data center. A particular server may be used to sup­
port several different applications. How do you accurately judge how much of 
your personnel resources are dedicated to a single application? While there may 
be a particular month when your staff is updating one application, in another 
month, those same staff members may be troubleshooting another application. 
In some organizations, there may have been attempts to tie computing costs to 
specific departments, but if so, the model is likely to have been very rough.
Consider, as a simple example, the use of email. Some departments are very 
heavy users, whereas others barely touch it at all. Pockets within a single 
department may be heavy users. Although technically you can monitor indi­
vidual use, doing so would require more overhead than it’s worth. 
	
If you want to have a rational economic approach to cloud adoption, unfortu­
nately you’ll have to analyze IT costs down to that kind of level.
	
The simple fact is that the cloud won’t necessarily be less expensive and it 
won’t necessarily provide the same level of service as your data center. Your 
own data center may have a service level agreement with a 99.999 percent 
uptime record. Will your cloud provider offer that same level of service? 
Probably not. You have to weigh how critical that level of predictable uptime 
is to your internal customers.
Listing application costs
In creating an economic model of an application, determine all the costs in a 
way that allows you to do a fair comparison. Here is a fairly comprehensive 
list of the possible costs, with notes:
	
✓	Server costs (A): With this and all other hardware components, you’re 
specifically interested in the total annual cost of ownership, which nor­
mally consists of the cost of hardware support plus some amortization 
cost for the purchase of the hardware.
	
✓	Storage costs (B): In situations where a storage area network (SAN) or 
network attached store (NAS) is used for an application, a proportional 
cost over the whole SAN or NAS needs to be determined, including man­
agement and support cost for the hardware.
	
✓	Network costs (C): This needs to be carefully considered because the fact 
that an application moves into the cloud does not necessarily mean that all 

249
 Chapter 21: Banking on Cloud Economics 
the network traffic it generates disappears. For example, data may need to 
be pulled from the application’s database to be added to a data warehouse. 
Alternatively, when Web applications are moved into the cloud, corporate 
Internet bandwidth requirements may be reduced. Clearly, the ability to 
access external applications requires substantial bandwidth.
	
✓	Backup and archive costs (D): The actual savings on backup costs 
depends on what the backup strategy will be when the application 
moves into the cloud. The same is true of archiving. Will all backup be 
done in the cloud? Will your organization still be required to back up a 
percentage of critical data?
	
✓	Disaster recovery costs (E): In theory, the cloud service will have its 
own disaster recovery capabilities, so there may be a consequential 
savings on disaster recovery. However, you need to clearly understand 
what your cloud provider’s disaster recovery capability is. Not all cloud 
providers have the same definition of disaster recovery. IT management 
must determine the level of support the cloud provider will offer.
	
✓	Data center infrastructure costs (F): A whole series of costs includ­
ing electricity, floor space, cooling, building maintenance, and so on 
can’t easily be attributed to individual applications, but can usually 
be assigned on the basis of the floor space that the hardware running 
the application occupies. For that reason, try to calculate a floor space 
factor for every application. 
	
	For example, if your data center is only 40 percent full, the economics of 
putting lots of additional capacity into the cloud is not financially viable. 
However, if your data center is 90 percent full and has been expand­
ing at 10 percent a year, you’ll run out of data center next year. At that 
point, you may have to build a data center that could cost as much as $5 
million. The cloud will be a much more economical choice.
	
✓	Platform costs (G): Some applications only run in specific operating 
environments — Windows, Linux, HP-UX, IBM zOS, and so on. The 
annual maintenance costs for the application operating environment 
need to be known and calculated as part of the overall costs.
	
✓	Software maintenance costs (package software) (H): Normally this cost 
element is simple because it comes down to the software’s annual main­
tenance cost. However, it may be complicated if the software license is 
tied to processor pricing. The situation could be further complicated if 
the specific software license is part of a bundled deal.
	
✓	Software maintenance costs (in-house software) (I): Such costs exist for 
all in-house software, but may not be broken out at an application level. 
For example, database licenses used across many different applications 
may be calculated at a corporate level. It may be necessary to allocate 
these database cost at a per-application level. There may also be these 
kinds of costs for packaged software if in-house components have been 
added or if integration components have been built to connect this 
application to other applications.

250
Part V: Planning for the Cloud 
	
✓	Help desk support costs (J): It’s necessary to analyze all help desk calls at 
an application level to determine the contribution of an application (if any) 
to help desk activity. The support costs for some applications may be 
anomalous and may disappear with the movement into the cloud. Some 
applications require more support than others. Understanding the different 
support requirements is key to making the right decision on the cloud. 
	
✓	Operational support personnel costs (K): There is a whole set of day-to-
day operational costs associated with running any application. Some are 
general costs that apply to every application, including staff support for 
everything from storage and archiving, to patch management and net­
works and security. Some support tasks, however, may be particular to a 
given application, such as database tuning and performance management.
	
✓	Infrastructure software costs (L): A whole set of infrastructure manage­
ment software is in use in any installation, and it has an associated cost. 
For example, management software is typically used for many different 
applications and can’t easily be divided across specific applications.
We now present a simple formula that states the annual data center cost of 
application ownership:
A + B + C + D + E + F + G + H + I + J + K + L
We refer to this cost as the Total Cost of Application Ownership (TCAO).
	
To be thorough, you should calculate this figure for every application and 
make sure that the overall total for all applications reconciles with the actual 
data center costs as recorded in the company accounts. If there is any dis­
crepancy, the model needs to be adjusted accordingly.
Recovering costs
It would be pleasant if you could simply compare the Total Cost of 
Application Ownership to the cost of running the application in the 
cloud and, if the cloud costs were less, schedule its move to the cloud. 
Unfortunately, you must also be concerned whether the application costs 
are actually recoverable, or how much of the costs are actually recoverable. 
Most of the factors we mention in the preceding section need to be consid­
ered in this regard. The following are worth noting:
	
✓	Server costs: If an application is relatively small, running in a virtual 
server, or perhaps only running occasionally, it’s unlikely that moving it 
to the cloud will result in any server hardware savings.
	
✓	Storage costs: Similarly, if very little storage is consumed by the applica­
tion, there may be no reduction in SAN or SAN costs.
	
✓	Network costs: Unless the amount of network capacity or Internet band­
width saved is large, it will probably be negligible.

251
 Chapter 21: Banking on Cloud Economics 
	
✓	Data center infrastructure costs: The floor space in the data center will 
not be reduced by the removal of a few servers and it may make little 
difference to cooling costs. There usually needs to be quite a significant 
change in order to bring down these costs.
	
✓	Platform costs: There may be a global license for platforms, especially 
where open source is used. Thus, the removal of an individual applica­
tion may result in no cost reduction. Is some situations you need to 
maintain the licenses for technologies such as middleware when you 
move to the cloud (because most companies end up having a hybrid). 
	
✓	Software maintenance costs (package software): This cost may be dif­
ficult to calculate if the software license is tied to processor pricing 
and the situation could be further complicated if the specific software 
license is part of a bundled deal or a global usage deal.
	
✓	Operational support personnel costs: Savings only occur here if there’s 
a possibility of saving a whole person or delaying the recruitment of 
another person.
	
✓	Infrastructure software costs: Infrastructure management software 
costs may not come down with the movement of a few workloads into 
the cloud.
On a per-application basis, you need to adjust costs to allow for factors like 
these.
Adjusting the Economic 
Model even Further 
A number of other considerations may alter the economics of cloud migra­
tion. All of them are strategic in nature. Amend the economic model to 
accommodate them.
Private cloud and allocation costs
	
In most cases, picking up an application and moving it to the cloud isn’t 
simple. Most likely there will be some configuration work and some testing 
done first. In addition, that application may not be well designed for the highly 
distributed nature of the cloud environment in its current form and it may 
need to be rewritten. This is another cost that needs to be taken into consider­
ation when deciding whether to move an application into the cloud.
While you might assume that all applications can move to the cloud, it isn’t true. 
Don’t look at the TCAO as a black-and-white situation. For those applications and 

252
Part V: Planning for the Cloud 
those workloads that are appropriate for the cloud, this TCAO is ideal. However, 
in the real world you have to split the economic analysis that takes into account 
those workloads that must remain in the data center. 
	
We discuss the private cloud in Chapter 9 and note that one of its primary 
functions is to allow the IT department to transform a data center into a more 
elastic and self-service environment. 
The same cost factors apply where there’s a private cloud, but how the IT 
department assesses the costs of the private cloud is a matter of policy. The 
private cloud may be built as a staging area for moving applications to the 
cloud, or as a way to move workloads to a more efficient, automated environ­
ment. Many companies will leverage their existing hardware, software, and 
networking assets as the foundation for a private cloud. 
From a policy perspective, companies shouldn’t simply take an action 
because it seems cheaper. They need base policy on what must stay in the 
traditional data center and why (for example, privacy and complexity and 
singularity of the workload). They then must have a policy that states that 
automation and self-provisioning will support the business and enable them 
to react to opportunities much faster. There also needs to be policy that 
specifies when a workload can safely be moved to a public cloud: Is the 
data safe enough in the private cloud? Is there an additional level of safety 
because of a virtual private network (VPN). All these questions are part of the 
larger economic decision-making process.
Based on the questions we pose, most companies will clearly use some 
combination of public and private cloud resources (called a hybrid). These 
private cloud environments may live in your company’s internal data center 
or they may be hosted by a private cloud vendor. Each company will have its 
own way of dealing with the allocation of capital expenditures versus operat­
ing expenditures with private cloud environments. For more details on pri­
vate and hybrid clouds, see Chapter 9.
Service levels and compliance costs
It’s unlikely that a cloud service will provide exactly the same service level that 
the data center has provided for an application. There will either be a hidden 
cost or benefit. In order to put a value on this, you need to estimate the cost to 
the business of the application being unavailable. This can then added (or sub­
tracted) as a further cost factor involved in moving the application to the cloud.

253
 Chapter 21: Banking on Cloud Economics 
	
Compliance (external or internal) can also be thought about as a service level 
cost. It may be necessary to get the cloud service audited to see that it meets 
the appropriate compliance requirements, which may relate to IT security or 
recovery procedures or any other such IT activity that must obey compliance 
standards.
Strategic considerations and costs
The IT context of your organization and its strategic direction need to be 
taken into account when deciding how any cloud costing model is applied. 
There are two important points worth paying attention to here:
	
✓	Data center capacity: Many organizations are running out of data center 
space. If they do run out of space, there’s likely to be a massive cost in 
getting extra space. Thus, for some organizations, freeing up space in 
the data center creates capacity that’s more valuable than it might oth­
erwise appear (because it will delay or even eliminate the need for addi­
tional data center space).
	
✓	Application grouping: Because of the advent and widespread adoption 
of service oriented architecture (see Chapter 19), the interdependence 
of application services has increased. For technical integration and per­
formance reasons, it may be impractical to think of applications on an 
individual basis, and instead to group them together when considering 
cloud migration.
Summarizing an Economic Cost Model
	
The economic costing model we outline involves the following steps:
	
1.	 Identify costs for all applications (or logical groups of applications) in 
terms of the Total Cost of Application Ownership (TCAO).
	
2.	 Adjust costs to reflect actual cost savings that might be achieved.
	
3.	 Factor in the cost of the private cloud (if there is one).
	
4.	 Factor in service level and compliance.
	
5.	 Take into account strategic factors (data center capacity and application 
groupings).

254
Part V: Planning for the Cloud 
This creates an apples-to-apples comparison that can help you make cloud 
migration decisions.
	
IT is a dynamic environment and is likely to remain so. The cloud computing 
market is only just being established and prices may change considerably over 
time. Similarly, data center costs will not remain static, and neither will tech­
nology. You therefore have to review the economic model on a regular basis.

Chapter 22
Starting Your Journey to the Cloud
In This Chapter
▶	Anticipating cultural issues with the cloud
▶	Assessing risks
▶	Identifying low-hanging fruit
▶	Planning for leveraging the cloud
T
he cloud model has lots of benefits, but there are also many issues — 
as there are with any new technology. In Chapter 4, we address how to 
develop a cloud strategy. Assuming you have decided to go with the cloud 
model, how do you get started? What factors do you need to consider as you 
begin? 
In this chapter, we try to boil it down for you. We start off by examining how 
to deal with the inevitable cultural issues that arise when you ask people to 
do things differently. And, although we discuss the risks associated with the 
cloud throughout the book, we highlight some of the more important ones 
again because risk assessment needs to be part of getting started. Finally, we 
talk about some other issues that you may or may not have considered, such 
as planning your long-term cloud strategy. 
Putting the Kibosh on 
Cloud Cultural Issues 
Anytime something new comes along, it may take people time to accept it. 
This was probably the case when zippers were introduced, and it will cer­
tainly be the case with the cloud. The reality is that change usually causes 
people to react. Sometimes they react positively to change, and sometimes 
this isn’t the case. 

256
Part V: Planning for the Cloud 
Anticipating (but not with relish)
	
Because you don’t know what might happen, it is important to anticipate 
issues and plan accordingly. 
Generally, issues associated with introducing new technology to an organiza­
tion fall into one of the following categories:
	
✓	People just don’t get it. Remember the Rutherford B. Hayes famous 
quote about the telephone: “An amazing invention — but who would 
ever want to use one?” Why did he say this? At the time, people used 
telegraphs and it wasn’t obvious to some why they’d want to actu­
ally hear another person’s voice when communicating long distance. 
Similarly, in the cloud, people need to be educated about how the model 
works and what the benefits are.
	
✓	People have legitimate concerns. There are, of course, legitimate rea­
sons for not wanting to adopt a certain technology. These reasons are 
usually about risk. In the cloud, people worry about security, manage­
ability, and availability. These are risks that consumers should be aware 
of, and we talk more about them in the next section.
	
✓	People feel threatened by new technology because they think it may 
affect their livelihood. This does happen — for example, the telephone 
switch replaced the telephone operators who used to connect your tele­
phone call. Your staff may be concerned about the impact that the cloud 
will have on their jobs. Even though they might not lose their jobs, they 
still want to understand what the impact will be to their current situation.
	
✓	People agree in principle with a technology, but it still might take 
some getting used to. Remember when the ATM was introduced? People 
liked the convenience of being able to get money whenever they wanted, 
but were used to writing checks and cashing them at the bank. It took 
time to trust this new way of doing things.
Any or all of these reactions should be expected as you deploy cloud technol­
ogy in your enterprise. Whether it’s the technician who’s concerned about 
putting virtual desktops in the cloud (and how the change will impact people 
staffing the IT help desk), or the database administrator who’s concerned 
about the security around a cloud database, or the scientist who’s thrilled at 
the prospect of being able to perform calculations in the cloud on demand — 
many people will be affected by the change, and you have to help smooth the 
transition.

257
 Chapter 22: Starting Your Journey to the Cloud
Smoothing the transition
What can you do about it? Here are some ideas that will help smooth the 
transition to the cloud model.
Get executive support
The move to the cloud will be smoother if you have executive support. If one 
of these executives can be designated the champion, so much the better. 
This person will send the message from the top and people will be more 
likely to listen.
Understand the culture
If your culture is one that embraces innovation and change, that’s great. 
However, if your company has been doing something one way for the last ten 
years, you need to understand that there will no doubt be some resistance. 
You need to plan your rollout accordingly.
Communicate the message
When you have executive support and understand the culture you’re dealing 
with, communicate the cloud message to those who will be impacted. There 
are many ways to do this, depending on your culture:
	
✓	Department meetings
	
✓	Memos
	
✓	Podcasts
	
✓	Internal social networks 
	
It’s also a good idea to have a formal statement about the business case for 
cloud, in case you have to really convince your staff. Additionally, for those 
whose jobs will be significantly impacted, it is important to communicate the 
message directly. Never underestimate the human side of the equation.
Educate the troops
	
Everyone in the organization who’s involved with cloud computing needs to 
understand three things:
	
✓	Why the company is moving some operations to the cloud model 
	
✓	What the benefits of the move will be for the organization
	
✓	How individual people will be impacted by the move to cloud computing

258
Part V: Planning for the Cloud 
This is the case for the remote worker who may now have a thin client on his 
desk; this is the case for the data center operator who now must monitor off-
site computers.
Get people involved
If people feel that they’re part of the change, they aren’t as likely to resist it. 
So, get people involved! Form transition committees and appoint people to 
lead the charge.
Train your staff 
Even if you’re just moving all your clinicians to a thin client virtualized cloud 
desktop, you may still need to do some training. Of course, the type of train­
ing will depend on the job function. 
	
✓	If you’re moving a lot of your workload to the cloud and your cloud pro­
vider has monitoring tools that you aren’t used to, obviously your staff 
will have to be trained on this. 
	
✓	If there are processes that change as a result of moving to the cloud 
model, there would be training involved in that, as well. 
	
✓	If you move to a SaaS model for some of your applications and they are 
new, people will have to be trained on that, as well.
Measuring Twice: Assessing Risks
Throughout this book we cover some of the risks you may face when moving 
to the cloud. Some of the people and business culture issues discussed ear­
lier in this chapter are considered as risk elements in the chapter on cloud 
strategy; see Chapter 4. The chapters on cloud delivery models (see Chapters 
10 through 12) consider the business process risks of adopting each of these 
models. In Chapter 16 we discuss risks from a technology and compliance 
perspective, including risks associated with data protection, security, cus­
tomer expectations, performance levels, and interoperability. 
Playing risk with categories
	
You need to manage several categories of risk as you move to the cloud:
	
✓	People
	
✓	Process
	
✓	Technology resource 

259
 Chapter 22: Starting Your Journey to the Cloud
Ask yourself these questions:
	
✓	What are the people and process risks associated with any new tech­
nology? How does this move mesh with people’s skills? For example, if 
you move your desktops to virtualized desktops in the cloud, your IT 
help desk might need some new skills. Or, if you move to a private cloud 
model, you may want to make sure that your team can manage the data 
center. Can the team be trained? 
	
✓	How might my processes change in the cloud? How will that impact 
your organization? Chances are that you can effectively address any 
people or process issues, but you shouldn’t forget about them.
	
✓	What about the technology resources? Every company (large and 
small) has its own tolerance level when it comes to risk. It may vary by 
application type. The more critical the application, the lower the toler­
ance. As you begin your journey into the cloud, consider each type of 
asset that is cloud bound and assess the risk associated with the move.
	
Assess the risk associated with a move to the cloud model. And know that this 
assessment isn’t a one-time thing. Monitor what your cloud provider is up to; 
make sure that your risk remains at an acceptable level.
Top company concerns
This chapter is about getting started with the cloud. We have pulled together 
some of the top questions companies consider when moving to the cloud:
	
✓	What are my security and privacy concerns? These are two of the top 
concerns that companies cite about a move to the cloud. In Chapter 15, 
we talk a lot about security. We note that in most circumstances, cloud 
security needs to be approached from a risk-management perspective. 
If your organization has risk-management specialists, involve them in 
cloud security planning.
	
✓	How available and reliable will my resources be? When you ran the 
data center, availability and reliability were under your own company 
control. Your IT organization probably has negotiated certain service 
level agreements with the departments in your company based on the 
criticality of your applications. With a move to the cloud, you need to 
ask yourself what levels of availability you need and what risk you’re 
willing to take if your service provider doesn’t meet agreed-upon levels. 
There may be some applications where you’re willing to take the risk 
and some where you are not. But you need to assess the risk. Remember 
too that you may not be compensated the way you think you should be 
if your provider’s service goes down.

260
Part V: Planning for the Cloud 
	
✓	What about my data? If you’re thinking about moving applications and 
data to the cloud, you need to address a number of questions. These 
include, but aren’t limited to, the following:
 
• Can my data be stored anywhere or does my company not allow 
data to cross country boundaries? 
 
• What happens if the data is lost? 
 
• Can I recover? 
 
• Who owns my data? 
	
	In other words, you need to weigh the risks associated with putting cer­
tain applications that rely on certain types of data into the cloud. It may 
well be that you’re comfortable with the risk, but you still need to look 
at it. Look back at Chapter 8 for more information about managing data 
in the cloud.
	
✓	Is my vendor viable? What happens if your service provider goes out of 
business? Will you be able to recover your assets? Who owns the intel­
lectual property?
	
✓	Will I be locked into one vendor? Although there are some movements 
afoot to move to an open cloud model (see Chapter 14), the cloud isn’t 
there yet. This means there are proprietary data formats and APIs out 
there. Assess what they are and whether it will be easy to move your 
assets from one provider to another.
	
✓	Are there other compliance or regulatory issues I need to be aware of? 
Make sure that your provider can adhere to any regulatory or compli­
ance issues your company has in place. You also need to make sure that 
they’re willing to change if something changes in your own industry. 
Assess the risk and the cost that might be associated with this.
	
Much of this boils down to trust and doing your homework. Do you trust your 
vendor and have you put the right contracts in place to protect yourself? Have 
you done your homework? If you haven’t, you need to do it. If you don’t trust 
the vendor, you shouldn’t be working with them.
Picking the Right Targets for Success
	
As we mention in Chapter 4, there’s no one right path to leveraging cloud ser­
vices within your business. It depends on the following:
	
✓	The state of your data center
	
✓	Your applications

261
 Chapter 22: Starting Your Journey to the Cloud
	
✓	Your service portfolio
	
✓	Your changing business requirements
	
We also think that it goes without saying (but we’ll say it anyway) that you 
probably don’t want to move all your applications and resources to the cloud 
too quickly. And, as we point out through this book, certain areas may never 
be right for the cloud. If you move too quickly, you might end up living your 
own worst nightmare. 
Instead, start by reviewing your IT portfolio to identify your first target. 
Select a specific area that demonstrates the value that you will get from a 
cloud model.
Picking the low-hanging fruit
Some areas are definitely ripe for cloud computing, which we refer to as low-
hanging fruit (no pun intended). Here are a few examples:
	
✓	You might want to get your feet wet with something like moving applica­
tion testing to a cloud environment. This has been a popular model for 
many companies. Instead of provisioning test servers on the company’s 
premises, testing is done, on demand, in the cloud. The benefits include 
as much capacity as needed and no provisioning time for the servers in 
the test environment. Some companies are also moving development to 
the cloud for similar reasons.
	
✓	Another relatively low risk example is simply provisioning overflow 
capacity for something like a marketing campaign.
	
✓	Beta testing an application. Here is an interesting one. Some business 
analytics companies find that companies like to try applications out in 
the cloud first, before buying them. Go figure!
Approaching other areas
If you’re planning to move some of your applications to the cloud, identify 
those applications that will give you the biggest bang for the buck. For exam­
ple, 70 percent of your company might use the same email and scheduling 
package in the same manner. Right now, you’re servicing these applications 
on the desktop, but it might make sense to move it to the cloud. On the other 
hand, there may be an analytical application that five of your scientists use. 
It probably wouldn’t make sense to move this application to a cloud model 
because you wouldn’t gain any economies of scale.

262
Part V: Planning for the Cloud 
Do your homework for other types of applications and resources. Can you 
gain economies of scale by moving these to the cloud and at the same time 
manage your risk tolerance? For example, what if there is an application that 
a large percent of your staff use, but they tend to customize it for their own 
purposes? You have to evaluate whether it makes sense to move it to a cloud 
environment. You need to consider a range of costs and whether people will 
be able to do their jobs effectively under a new model.
Planning for Leveraging the Cloud
Say that you’ve moved to the cloud and started transitioning some of your 
applications to the cloud model. We think that while leveraging the cloud can 
be a good idea for many companies, you have to make sure that you manage 
the move properly. What do we mean? 
Clearly, some of the move to the cloud will require that you think about man­
aging your IT assets in a slightly different way. These changes fall into two 
categories: planning and doing.
	
These examples illustrate the need for proper planning so that your transi­
tion to the cloud makes sense. We hope that these scenarios don’t happen in 
your company. However, these two somewhat simplistic examples show how 
important it is to plan for the cloud in a holistic manner. Otherwise, your com­
pany might be doomed to repeat some of the sins of the past.
Example 1
Say you’re an electronics distributor that was using a CRM application 
that no one was particularly happy with. Fred over in the camera depart­
ment decides to move all that group’s sales information to a SaaS provider. 
However, Jane in the printer department decides to move that same sales 
function for her department to another SaaS provider. 
When the CEO wants to know how sales are going across the two divisions, 
Fred and Jane scramble to get their data integrated. This problem sounds 
like the problem companies have had for ages with siloed information — data 
from different systems isolated into different environments, making it hard to 
integrate and manage. The same sort of thing can happen in the cloud if your 
cloud provider uses a proprietary format for storing data.

263
 Chapter 22: Starting Your Journey to the Cloud
Example 2
Two divisions in a company with separate IT departments decide that they 
want to store some of their data in the cloud. Unknown to each other, they 
pick the same cloud provider and negotiate separate contracts with that pro­
vider. Now the company has two contracts to manage where it could have 
had one (probably more favorable). This can potentially cost the company 
more in the long run.

Chapter 24
Ten Cloud Dos and Don’ts
In This Chapter
▶	Choosing the right starting point
▶	Standing on the shoulders of SOA giants
▶	Watching your back
▶	Being part of a SOA team
W
e spend most of this book describing the cloud in great detail. In this 
chapter, we focus on a few simple dos and don’ts.
Don’t Be Reactive
Many businesspeople who want to save money fast are tempted to throw 
out the data center and put all computing into a public cloud. Although this 
might sound good for a few hours, it isn’t a thoughtful approach. In the end, 
you might decide which capabilities that you should put into the cloud, but 
you need to do your homework first. For example, do you have compliance 
issues to consider? What is the difference in cost between a public, private, 
hybrid, or even a traditional data center? You need to make sure that all the 
possible impacts have been considered before you spring into action.
Do Consider the Cloud a Financial Issue
You might start looking at some approaches to the cloud that sound really 
good. But before you jump in, do the math. How large is your company? 
What’s the nature of your computing environment? How many applications 
do you support? How much does your current environment cost? How much 
spare capacity do you have in your data center? Are there applications that 
can cost effectively be moved to a Software as a Service model? Before you 
do anything, follow the money.

272
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Don’t Go It Alone
Although some companies have the sophistication to build their own clouds, 
they’re the exception. Most companies need help, so don’t go into this alone. 
An entire industry is just waiting out there to help you. Don’t ignore it. Beg, 
borrow, steal, but get help. Talk to your peers who have done some early 
cloud projects. Consult with systems integrators, technology companies, 
and other consultants who have solid experience with best practices. Some 
cloud Web sites and organizations have great ideas and collaboration 
opportunities.
Do Think about Your Architecture
Just because you’re thinking about moving into the cloud doesn’t mean archi­
tecture is no longer important. In fact, it’s more important than ever. You’ll 
probably have business services that are designed for reuse that should be 
stored in a private or public cloud that need to be designed for reuse. You 
will likely have a hybrid environment that needs to be well planned to 
conform to your company’s service level agreement and performance 
requirements.
Don’t Neglect Governance
	
If you don’t pay attention to compliance and governance, you’re putting your 
company at risk. For example, some industries require that you store data in 
a very specific way. Some countries require that your customer data never is 
stored outside of its territory. You still have to comply with government regu­
lations. These issues don’t disappear into a cloud.
Don’t Forget about Business Process
	
Start with the business process that you want to automate with your cloud 
initiatives. No matter which form of cloud you’re considering, process 
is the building block. If you haven’t figured out how business processes 
will be managed in this new distributed world, your business could be at 
risk.

273
 Chapter 24: Ten Cloud Dos and Don’ts
Do Make Security the Centerpiece 
of Your Strategy
It’s easy to get caught up in the mix-and-match euphoria and forget about the 
nitty-gritty issues. Pay close attention to the security implications of moving 
to the cloud. You still need a well-planned security strategy.
Don’t Apply the Cloud to Everything
Don’t get carried away. Not everything belongs in a cloud. For example, your 
data center might have a large, complex, and customized application used by 
a dozen people. It’s critical to your business. You have no economic or busi­
ness reason to move that application to the cloud. 
Do your homework so you have guidelines to help you determine if an appli­
cation or a function belongs in the data center, a public cloud, or a private 
cloud.
Don’t Forget about Service Management
	
It’s easy to make the assumption that if something is in the cloud, you don’t 
have to worry about managing it. This isn’t true. Although many cloud pro­
viders allow you to have a portal view of their own service levels, it’s your 
responsibility to keep track of any service you have put into either a public or 
a private cloud. Because many companies inevitably have a hybrid environ­
ment, you need to manage your overall service level.
Do Start with a Pilot Project
Cloud computing will be around for a long time, so get experience now. Start 
with a pilot project. For example, you might want to start with a Software as 
a Service platform. You might use a public cloud for testing a new application 
before it goes into production. This gives you a feeling for what it means to 
give up this level of control. 
	
You are still responsible for the integrity and security of your information. 
Finding out how to manage your cloud vendors is an important starting point.
