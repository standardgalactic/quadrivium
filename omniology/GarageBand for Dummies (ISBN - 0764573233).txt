Author’s Acknowledgments
First and foremost: Thank you for buying my book.
This book was a team effort. Though my name appears on the
cover, it wouldn’t exist without the extraordinary efforts of that
team. And so, before we go any further, I’d like to take this oppor-
tunity to express my heartfelt gratitude to all of them . . . 
Major thanks to Andy Cummings and Bob Woerner at Wiley, for
believing in this project and giving it the green light. 
Big time thanks to my project editor, Becky Huehls, who not only
minded my Ps and Qs, but managed to keep me from using the
word, “stuff,” on every page. I’d also like to thank copy editors
John Edwards and Jean Rogers for their fine work, and all the folks
in production for their efforts in putting together the book you
hold in your hands.
My super duper literary agent, Carole McClendon at Waterside
Productions, deserves a double helping o’ praise for putting up
with me all these years. Thanks again (and, you’ll always be Swifty
to me).
A heaping helping of thank-you to my tech editor, researcher, and
all-around good influence, Bryan Chaffin. This book wouldn’t be
the same without his massive contribution, and I can tell you with-
out reservation, Bryan Chaffin rocks.
And to my wife, Lisa, and my kids, Allison and Jacob, thanks once
again for putting up with my all-too-frequent hibernations and
giving me the space I need to do what I do. I love you guys.
Whew. I’m almost done, but I’d be remiss if I didn’t thank some of
the nice folks at Apple who helped this book along in some way
including iLife Product Manager Peter Lowe, PR Specialist Nathalie
Welch, and of course, the Czarina of Product Loan, Keri Walker.
Last but definitely not least: Thanks to Apple, for creating
GarageBand and pricing it right.

Introduction
I
f you want to make music with GarageBand, you’ve made the right choice
twice — once by choosing GarageBand, which has to be the easiest way
yet to create your own music, and again by choosing this book to help you
along. Before you know it, you’ll be topping the charts and basking in fame,
glory, and fortune.
Well, it is possible. By the time you finish this book, you’ll possess the knowl-
edge, although I’m afraid you’ll have to provide the talent yourself.
Don’t worry. Just sit back, relax, and get ready to have a rockin’ good time.
That’s right. This may be a computer book, but we are going to have a good
time together. What a concept! And I promise it’s true — whether you’re new
to music making or a grizzled studio veteran, I guarantee that learning to
make music with GarageBand For Dummies is going to be fun and easy. Hey, it
couldn’t go on the cover in such big letters if it weren’t true.
About This Book
Of course, GarageBand For Dummies is going to show you everything you need
to get the most out of Apple’s amazing GarageBand recording-studio-in-a-box
software. But I hope to give you much more than that.
Here’s a quick look at just some of what this book can do for you:
 You find out how to use every one of GarageBand’s numerous (and very
cool) features.
 You get the lowdown on the equipment you need, the gear you don’t
need but may want, and the gear that you don’t want or need — plus all
you need to know to set up and connect everything.
 You find details about creating great-sounding songs all by your lone-
some and then distributing them to your friends (or enemies) and (gasp)
perhaps even selling them.
 You’re gently introduced to many professional audio-recording and 
-engineering techniques that can help you impress your friends with
slick, professional-sounding recordings.
GarageBand For Dummies is chock-full of useful information, plus tips and
techniques for making good multitrack recordings. If you follow my simple

instructions, you gain the skills you need to produce great-sounding record-
ings that are sure to impress your family and friends, not to mention musi-
cians, singers, songwriters, and producers.
Not-So-Foolish Assumptions
Although I know what happens when you make assumptions, I’ve made a few
anyway. The biggest is that you, gentle reader, know nothing about making
multitrack recordings or using GarageBand.
I also assume that you know what a Mac is, that you know how to turn one on
and use it, that you have a copy of GarageBand, that you want to understand
GarageBand without digesting an incomprehensible technical manual, and
that you made the right choice by selecting this particular book.
There is one more thing: I assume that you can read.
Conventions Used in This Book
To get the most out of this book, you need to know how I do things and why.
Here are a few conventions that I use in this book to make your life easier:
 When I want you to open an item in a menu, I write something like
“Choose File➪Open,” which means, “Click the File menu and choose the
Open command.”
 Stuff that you’re supposed to type appears in bold type, like this.
 Sometimes an entire sentence is in bold, as you’ll see when I present a
numbered list of steps. In those cases, I unbold what you’re supposed
to type, like this.
 When I refer to the Ú menu, I’m referring to the menu in the upper-left
corner of the Mac OS X menu bar that looks like a blue or graphite apple
(called the Apple menu). I never use the Ú symbol to refer to the key on
your Mac keyboard that may or may not have both the pretzel-looking Ô
and an Ú on it. I refer to that key (called the Command key) with the
equally funky Ô symbol.
 For keyboard shortcuts, I write something like “Ô-A,” which means to
hold down the Ô key (the one with the little pretzel and/or Ú symbol on
it) and then press the letter A on your keyboard. If you see something
like “Ô-Shift-A,” that means to hold down the Ô and Shift keys while
pressing the A key. Again, for absolute clarity, I never refer to the Ô key
with the Ú symbol. I reserve that symbol for the Ú menu (Apple menu).
For the Command key, I only use the Ô symbol.

GarageBand For Dummies 

How This Book Is Organized
GarageBand For Dummies is divided into five logical parts, numbered (sur-
prisingly enough) 54 through 59. OK, that’s not true. I’m merely checking to
see whether you’re paying attention. They’re numbered 1 through 5, and
through no fault of mine, they’re numbered with stuffy old Roman numerals.
So you’ll see I through V where you (in my humble opinion) ought to see
Arabic numbers 1 through 5. I think it’s some rule we For Dummies authors
have to follow. Anyway, it’s better if you read the parts in order, but if you
already know a lot — or think you know a lot — feel free to skip around and
read the parts that you don’t think you know.
Part I: Starting on a Good Note
Part I gives you the basics, serving up skills and knowledge that you can
build upon as you create your own music with GarageBand, starting in Part II.
Chapter 1 starts you off nice and easy by painting a big picture of all the
things GarageBand is and does. In Chapter 2, you set up your “studio” and
find out about the equipment that you’ll want or need. Chapter 3 is short, a
treatise on tweaking GarageBand’s user preferences to make GarageBand
work just the way you want it to. Then, I wrap up this part with a look at the
multitrack recording process from beginning to end in Chapter 4.
Part II: Laying Down Tracks
Part II is where you get into the meat of the matter: making your own music
with GarageBand. Chapter 5 introduces you to Apple Loops, which are song
snippets that you can assemble into an almost-frighteningly professional-
sounding tune in minutes. Chapter 6 delves into MIDI (Musical Instrument
Digital Interface), with just enough information to make you dangerous. You
then record music using GarageBand’s built-in software instruments and your
MIDI keyboard (if you have one).
Chapter 7 covers recording vocals or acoustic instruments with a micro-
phone. And finally, Chapter 8 shows you the ins and outs of recording guitar,
bass, and other amplified instruments.
Part III: Post-Production:
Finishing Your Song
After your tracks are recorded, you probably want to polish them by editing,
overdubbing, mixing, adding audio effects, and finally, mastering all those tracks
3
Introduction

down to a single track (for mono) or two tracks (for stereo). That pretty much
sums up Part III. In Chapter 9, you discover the joys of editing your tracks or,
as I see it, the joys of fixing your mistakes quickly and easily. In Chapter 10,
you marvel at the macrocosm known as mixing — that alchemistic undertak-
ing where you adjust the level and tonal characteristics of each individual
track so that they all blend together harmoniously. Finally, Chapter 11 shows
you the deep, dark secrets of mastering, replete with those fabulous finishing
touches that make your recordings sound like the real thing.
Part IV: Sharing Your Creations 
with Others
You’ve finished your masterpiece, and now you surely want to share it.
Fortunately, Part IV shows you all you need to know. In Chapter 12, you
receive a complete lesson in burning audio CDs that your friends can play on
their home or car stereo or their computer. Then, Chapter 13 takes it a step
further and shows how to create both AAC and MP3 files from your record-
ings, and then put these files on the Web for either downloading or stream-
ing. Part IV concludes with Chapter 14, which is chock-full of different ways
that you can use GarageBand with the rest of your iLife — iMovie, iDVD,
iPhoto, and of course, iTunes.
Part V: The Part of Tens
What For Dummies book would be complete without the infamous Part of
Tens, a collection of Letterman-style essays that are presented in the easily
recognized form of a top-ten list. Chapter 15 contains ten add-ons that can
help make your GarageBand recordings even better. Moving right along,
Chapter 16 tackles troubleshooting performance, or, ten things to do when
GarageBand skids to a halt. Chapter 17 offers ten superb suggestions to help
you take your recordings to the next level. And finally, we close out our regu-
larly scheduled programming with Chapter 18, which details ten terrific
resources for music producers.
Icons Used in This Book
You’ll see little round pictures (icons) off to the left side of the text through-
out this book. Consider these icons as miniature road signs, telling you a little
something extra about the topic at hand. Here’s what the different icons look
like and what they all mean.

GarageBand For Dummies 

Look for Tip icons to find the juiciest morsels: shortcuts, tips, and undocu-
mented secrets about GarageBand. Try them all; impress your friends!
When you see this icon, it means that this particular morsel is something that
I think you should memorize (or at least write on your shirt cuff).
This icon signifies something that’s not required reading. It could be about
pro audio, programming, or progressive rock, but whatever it is, it’s not
required for you to master GarageBand. (On the other hand, it must be inter-
esting or informative, or I wouldn’t have wasted your time with it.)
Read these notes very, very carefully. Did I say ver-y? Warning icons flag
important information. The author and publisher won’t be responsible if your
Mac explodes or spews flaming parts because you ignored a Warning icon.
Just kidding. Macs don’t explode or spew (with the exception of a few choice
PowerBook 5300s, which can’t run GarageBand anyway). But I got your atten-
tion, didn’t I? It’s a good idea to read the Warning icons carefully.
These icons represent my ranting or raving about something that just bugs
me. Imagine foam coming from my mouth. Rants are required to be irrever-
ent, irrelevant, or both. I also try to keep them short, more for your sake than
for mine.

Part I
Starting on a 
Good Note

In this part . . .
P
art I lays the groundwork for making great music
with GarageBand. In Chapter 1, you are introduced to
the software itself, as well as the all-important process of
digital multitrack recording (which is what GarageBand
does). Chapter 2 helps you determine your recording studio
needs and wants (and budget), and then gets down to the
nuts and bolts of speakers, cables, audio interfaces, and
other devices that you can use to achieve better sound.
Chapter 3 covers preference settings for GarageBand, based
on the assumption that you set these things the way you
prefer them before you start working — not after. Finally,
in Chapter 4, it all comes together as you explore the mul-
titrack recording process and discover how multitrack
recordings are created using GarageBand.

W
hen GarageBand was introduced at Macworld Expo in January 2004,
Apple C.E.O. Steve Jobs informed the audience that one out of two
adults play a musical instrument but that almost none of them have recorded
themselves playing.
Why not? Because before GarageBand came along, recording live music
decently was just too darned complicated. It required expensive, hard-to-use
software and expensive external hardware, not to mention a basic under-
standing of audio engineering.
GarageBand changes everything. Now if you want to record yourself singing
or playing, GarageBand lets you do it without spending a lot of time or
money. Better still; GarageBand will give you professional-sounding results
even if you don’t know the first thing about audio recording.
In this chapter you’ll begin your acquaintance with GarageBand. First, you’ll
learn a bit about what it is and what you can do with it, along with what it is
not and what it can’t do. Then, we’ll review GarageBand’s system requirements
followed by a quick look at the recording process.

What Is GarageBand?
GarageBand is the fifth and newest iLife application; it turns your Mac 
into a fully equipped recording studio, complete with hundreds of realistic-
sounding musical instruments and audio effects, all preconfigured by experi-
enced recording engineers.
In a nutshell, GarageBand is everything you need to record, mix, master, and
share music with others.
GarageBand’s default settings are a big part of the reason GarageBand is so
great, especially for beginners. The instruments and audio effects sound
great right out of the box, and they rarely require much (if any) tweaking. It’s
kind of like having a crew of professional engineers right inside your Mac.
GarageBand is the latest addition to Apple’s iLife family of software, along
with iTunes, iMovie, iDVD, and iPhoto. At Macworld Expo in January 2004,
Apple CEO Steve Jobs described iLife ’04 as “Microsoft Office for the rest of
your life,” which sums things up quite nicely.
There has never been a program like GarageBand; it is the perfect introduc-
tion to multitrack audio recording. I mean that. GarageBand is easy, friendly,
forgiving, and fun. And you can’t beat the price.
Multitrack recording means recording instruments or vocals with each instru-
mental or vocal performance recorded on its own track. The sound contained
in each track can be adjusted independently of other tracks. Ultimately, the
tracks are combined (that is, mixed) in a pleasing manner to create the final
product.
I’ve used ’em all; if you’re new to this audio thing, nothing else even comes
close to GarageBand. You’re gonna love it.
What Can You Do with GarageBand?
GarageBand does things that used to require hours in an expensive recording
studio. The following is a fairly comprehensive list of what you can do with
GarageBand:
 Record vocals
 Record acoustic instruments
10
Part I: Starting on a Good Note 

 Record software instruments via MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital
Interface; more on that in Chapter 2)
 Record electric guitars with GarageBand’s virtual amplifier models, so
that you can get just the sound you want
 “Punch in” to a section of an otherwise excellent track to re-record over
your mistakes
 Adjust the volume (level) and other sonic characteristics (the way
things sound) of anything and everything you’ve recorded
 Make music using prerecorded loops
 Combine multiple tracks of music and/or loops into a two-track (stereo)
file (so that you can play all the parts and combine them into one song)
 Record a track while listening to other tracks
 Adjust the sonic characteristics — volume, equalization, echo, reverb,
and so on — for each track individually (all these elements are part of
mixing a song, which I cover in Chapter 10)
 Adjust the sonic characteristics — volume, equalization, echo, reverb,
and so on — for the song as a whole (in other words, mastering, which I
delve into in Chapter 11)
And, of course, being a member of the iLife family of Apple software, you can
use any song you create in GarageBand in the other iLife apps; in your iPhoto
slideshows, iDVD menus, and iMovie projects. And, of course, you can burn
your GarageBand-created tunes into audio CDs with iTunes.
This list doesn’t cover everything you can do with GarageBand, but it at least
gives you the gist of the cool stuff you can do.
What Can’t You Do with GarageBand?
Well, there’s not much GarageBand can’t do. Perhaps its biggest shortcoming
(versus more sophisticated recording studio-type software or an analog
recording studio) is that GarageBand limits you to recording one track at a
time. So, for example, if you sing and play acoustic guitar, you’ll usually
record your guitar track first, and then record the vocal track(s). A more
sophisticated multitrack recording setup would allow you to sing and play at
the same time, recording voice and guitar (on separate tracks) at the same
time. Any decent recording studio allows the simultaneous recording of 8, 16,
24, or more tracks.
11
Chapter 1: In the Beginning: Introducing GarageBand

As you might expect, this shortcoming makes it extremely challenging to
record drums using GarageBand. That’s because drums usually require four,
five, six, or more microphones, with each microphone recording to a separate
track. You can find ways to work around this (and I look at some of them in
Chapters 7, 8 and 15), but they’re not pretty or easy to pull off. So if you
happen to be a drummer, you may want to consider other software and hard-
ware for recording your music. Or plan to spend a lot of time recording your
drums track by track.
Another shortcoming in GarageBand is that you may not change the time sig-
nature in the middle of a song. If your song starts out in 4/4 time, the whole
song has to be in 4/4 time. Although there are ways to creatively work around
this limitation in GarageBand, none of them are simple or fun.
Most other audio recording software lets you change time signatures anywhere
in a song without missing a beat (pun intended). So if you tend to write songs
that have time changes in ’em, GarageBand may not be your best choice.
Finally, it’s way too easy to create a song that has too many instruments or
tracks for your Mac to handle. The older your Mac and the less RAM it has,
the more likely you will encounter this issue sooner rather than later. Although
this can also happen when you use higher-end audio software, it happens more
often and with fewer tracks or instruments enabled in GarageBand.
The next section covers GarageBand’s system requirements, so I’ll hold the
gory details until then. Suffice it to say that the newer Macs (G4 and G5) with
plenty of RAM in ’em run GarageBand better than older Macs (for example,
a G3, even one with plenty of RAM).
Other things you can’t do with GarageBand include typesetting a book,
removing red eye from a digital photograph, and sending your mom an e-mail
message. Still, the issues I just described seem to be the ones that are the
most likely to give you ulcers.
So there you have ’em — GarageBand’s biggest boogers in my book (pun-
induced groan).
Checking Your System Requirements
Whether you know it or not, GarageBand does a lot of intense processing
behind the scenes. So, not surprisingly, GarageBand requires more Mac
horsepower than the other iLife applications.
12
Part I: Starting on a Good Note 

So before you go any further with GarageBand, make sure your Mac is up to
snuff.
The official requirements
The official system requirements (copied right from the side of an iLife box)
are as follows:
 Macintosh computer with a PowerPC G3, G4, or G5 processor
• 600 MHz G3 or faster required for GarageBand
• G4 or faster required for GarageBand software instruments
 256MB of physical RAM
 Mac OS X v10.2.6 or later (Mac OS X v10.2.8 or later recommended)
 QuickTime 6.4 or later (QuickTime 6.5 included)
 Display with at least 1024 x 768 pixel resolution
 DVD drive required to install GarageBand (and iDVD)
 4.3GB of hard drive space required to install GarageBand, iTunes,
iPhoto, iMovie, and iDVD
If you purchased GarageBand as part of Apple’s iLife ’04 retail package,
GarageBand and iDVD can only be installed from the iLife DVD. If you don’t
have your own DVD drive, you can use any FireWire DVD reader that you can
beg or borrow, because after the installation, GarageBand doesn’t care
whether you have a DVD drive.
Unfortunately, iDVD not only needs to be installed from a DVD, it will not
burn a DVD unless you have an authentic internal Apple SuperDrive. In this
case, a FireWire DVD drive doesn’t cut it. Luckily, the rest of the iLife ’04
applications don’t share this limitation.
The realistic requirements:
Dr. Mac’s advice
Now, please allow me to add my two-cents worth:
13
Chapter 1: In the Beginning: Introducing GarageBand

 Cent #1: GarageBand may run on a G3, but it won’t run well.
 Cent #2: 256MB of physical RAM may be enough to play and record your
one-finger rendition of “Mary Had a Little Lamb,” but it’s not enough to
do a lot more than that. I recommend at least another quarter or half
gigabyte of RAM; GarageBand will run much better if you have a total of
512MB or even 1024MB of RAM.
As a bonus, the more RAM you have in your Mac, the more tracks your
songs can have before GarageBand chokes. If you want to know how much
memory GarageBand actually uses, open up the Activity Monitor (in
/Applications/Utilities). You’ll see that even when GarageBand is open but
minimized to the Dock, as shown in Figure 1-1, it uses more RAM and more
processing power than any other program that’s running.
But wait; it gets worse: If GarageBand is merely running in the background, as
shown in Figure 1-2, it uses three times more processor power than when it
was minimized.
Any program or utility that uses that many CPU cycles even when it’s mini-
mized or in the background slows everything else down. I recommend that
you quit all other apps when you use GarageBand and quit GarageBand
(GarageBand➪Quit GarageBand) immediately when you’re done using it each
and every time.

Part I: Starting on a Good Note 

What Else Do You Need to
Run GarageBand?
Although there are hardware and software items you may want or need
(which are discussed in loving detail in the very next chapter), even if you
don’t acquire a single item recommended in Chapter 2, you can have a lot of
fun using nothing but GarageBand all by itself.
If your Mac has a built-in microphone, as most of them do, you can use it to
record vocals and musical instruments. The quality will not be as good as any
external microphone, but in a pinch, you can use built-in microphones to cap-
ture the moment.
And, you can use GarageBand’s on-screen keyboard to play any of the soft-
ware instruments, as shown in Figure 1-3. It’s hard to play music by clicking a
mouse, and you can’t actually play chords on this keyboard, but it’s better
than nothing at all and it’s free.
Speaking of which, be sure to pause for a brief interlude about tape — the old
kind (cassette, 1⁄2-inch, 1-inch, and 2-inch) and the new kind (hard drive) in the
sidebar, “Recording with tape versus a hard drive.”

Part I: Starting on a Good Note 
Recording with tape versus a hard drive
In the old days, you recorded to tape. The more
tracks you wanted to record at a time, the more
expensive the studio time, equipment, actual
tape, and so on. Hobbyists recorded two, four,
or eight tracks at a time onto tape that was 1⁄8, 1⁄4,
or 1⁄2-inch wide. Professionals tended to record
16 or more tracks at once onto 1-inch or 2-inch
tape. The more tracks a studio could record at a
time, the more you paid per hour to use that
studio.
The specialized equipment used in the profes-
sional or semi-professional recording studio —
particularly the multi-track tape recorders and
mixing boards (or “consoles”) with 16 or more
tracks, as shown in the following figure — were
(and still are) quite expensive.
Luckily, hard drives work as well as tape
recorders for storing recorded audio, and
thanks to the popularity of the personal com-
puter, big, fast hard drives are dirt cheap com-
pared to almost any decent multitrack recording
device. Better still, a hard drive doesn’t come
with a predefined track limit. Put another way,
an 8-track tape recorder can only record eight
tracks at a time, maximum. On the other hand,
on a hard drive, you can record (and mix and
master) as many tracks as your software and
hardware setup permit.
Much of the music you hear today has never
been anywhere near magnetic audio tape.
Instead, it has (usually) become cheaper, faster,
and easier to forget about tape entirely and
record tracks “direct to disk.” And that is pre-
cisely what GarageBand is doing when you
record a track.

Recording with GarageBand:
A Few Teasers
Before I move on to the discussion of your recording space and audio gear,
I think you should have a slightly clearer picture of the way this whole
17
Chapter 1: In the Beginning: Introducing GarageBand
Packaging your music
Technically, the file you create when you use
the Save or Save As command in GarageBand
is a package. A package is a special kind of
Mac OS X document that looks like a document
icon but acts like a folder. In other words, a
package document contains other files like a
folder. But when you open a package (by
double-clicking, choosing File➪Open, or by
using the Ô-O shortcut), rather than revealing
its contents, the package document launches
into the application that created it. So when you
open a GarageBand package document,
GarageBand opens.
The secret to package documents is that when
you Control-click them, the contextual menu
offers the Show Package Contents option, as
shown in the following figure.
Inside a GarageBand document package, you’ll
find a Media folder. Inside the Media folder,
you’ll find the individual files that represent the
tracks in that song, as shown in the following
figure.

recording-studio-in-a-box thing works. This material is covered throughout
the book in glorious detail, but these brief “sneak peeks” should make the big
picture a little clearer.
Sneak peek 1 walks (actually, more like sprints) you through the process of
making songs with GarageBand. Sneak peek 2 is a quick look at GarageBand
itself.
Sneak peek 1: The recording sequence
When the folks at Apple say GarageBand contains everything you need to
create songs, they aren’t kidding. It really does give you everything you need:
recording, editing, loops, software instruments, overdubbing, mixing, master-
ing, and the ability to make your own audio CDs that you can share with
friends or even sell.
I delve further into every step of the process in upcoming chapters. For now,
I’d like to provide a painless introduction to the process of making a multi-
track audio recording:
1. Select or write the material.
I know this seems obvious, but it bears mention just the same. Creating
an audio recording, like so many things in life, is subject to the GIGO
effect — Garbage In, Garbage Out.
There are, of course, exceptions. If you prefer jam bands, aural sound-
scapes, random noise, trance music, or Brian Eno, you can probably skip
right over this step. As for the rest of you: It’s better if you have an idea
of what you want to record before you launch GarageBand.
’Nuff said.
2. Rehearse (and/or record your rehearsals).
Rehearsal can make your recording sessions faster and easier.
Later in the book, I countermand this advice and tell some of you to
record every note you ever play. When I produced the band Vengeance,
who were all really good players, I would say: “Tape is cheap. Studio
time isn’t. I record every note from the moment you plug in until you
walk out of the studio. I’m not losing a single usable note just because
the tape wasn’t rolling.”
As for me, I’m such a terrible musician that I never even record a take
until I can play the part without mistakes (or at least play the part with-
out a mistake in every measure).
18
Part I: Starting on a Good Note 

If you have more than a drop of musical talent, though, you might want
to record your practice takes. Sometimes, that first or second “practice”
take turns out to be the best.
If tape is cheap, hard drives are cheaper, which is a good thing because
GarageBand chews up hard drive space at a rapid clip. My songs range
from 30 or 40MB for the simple ones to over 100MB for more complex
tunes. At any time, I may be working on a dozen different tunes or more.
It doesn’t take long to accumulate several gigabytes of GarageBand song
files.
If you find that your main hard drive is getting full, you can either buy a
big external FireWire drive (the best option; you find out my reasoning
for this in Chapter 2), or delete (or archive to another hard drive, to CD,
or to DVD) files that are less important to you than your GarageBand
songs.
3. Record tracks.
When you know what you’re trying to do, record the tracks for it. Record
as many tracks as the song requires and record them until your perfor-
mances are as good as they can be.
4. Edit and overdub.
As soon as all (or most) of your song’s tracks are “in the can,” it’s time to
fix what ails them. Most people, including many professional musicians,
can’t record every track perfectly in a single “take.” There are often
imperfections, major and minor — an unwanted breath in the wrong
place, guitar string noise in a quiet passage, a dog barking in the back-
ground, or whatever. So listen to your tracks with a critical ear, and then
fix or replace anything that doesn’t sound right to you.
5. Mix.
When all (or most) of your tracks represent the best performance you
can possibly create, it’s time to begin mixing. When you mix, you adjust
each track’s individual level (volume), equalization (tone), and pan
(placement left, right, or center in the stereo sound field), and add audio
effects such as echo or reverb, striving for a perfect “mix” of the tracks
that blends together well and sounds good to your ears.
6. Master.
If you’ve made it through Steps 1 through 5, you’re so close to complet-
ing the song that you should be able to taste it. But before you break out
the bubbly, you probably want to master your masterpiece. In the very
simplest of terms, mastering is the same as mixing, but you adjust audio
controls such as level, equalization, compression, expansion, and limiting,
applying them to the entire song, rather than any single track.
19
Chapter 1: In the Beginning: Introducing GarageBand

Mastering isn’t rocket science. All you’re doing is adjusting the tonal
qualities and dynamics of the song the same way you adjusted those
things for individual tracks when you mixed it. Just play with the master-
ing effects until the song has the sound you’re looking for, and you’re
done.
You can find out more about Steps 4, 5, and 6 in Part III.
That’s a very simplistic overview of the process, but that’s the process:
rehearse, record, edit and overdub, mix, and master. There is one more
step, but it’s purely optional, which is:
7. Share your work with others.
If you did a good job on the song, you’ll want to share your brilliance
with others by burning the song to an audio CD, or by creating an MP3
or AAC file of the song and attaching it to an e-mail message or making it
available on the Web.
Seven simple steps are all it takes to make a magnum opus of your very own.
Before I close out this chapter, I give you a quick gander at the program that
makes the magic happen. So let me introduce to you the app you’ve known
for all these days (it’s okay to sing along — I know you know the tune):
Apple’s Awesome Program GarageBand.
Sneak peek 2: GarageBand
They say a picture is worth a thousand words; if so, this should be worth
around five grand. I’ll start this quick pictorial of GarageBand with something
you see often: The No Song Open dialog box shown in Figure 1-4. You’ll see
this dialog box the first time you launch GarageBand, and again any time you
close the active (only) GarageBand document.
GarageBand, like other iLife programs, forces you to work with only one doc-
ument at a time. If you close the active document, you see the No Song Open
dialog box, no ifs, ands, or buts. This is actually a very good thing: GarageBand
uses an inordinate amount of your Mac’s processor and memory (as I mention
earlier, in the section, “The realistic requirements: Dr. Mac’s advice”).
Figure 1-4:
The No
Open Song
dialog box.
20
Part I: Starting on a Good Note 

Here are the basics of working through the GarageBand interface from the No
Song Open dialog box:
1. If you click the Create New Song button (in the No Open Song dialog
box), the next thing you see is the New Project dialog box; you can see
one rendition of it in Figure 1-5.
2. Clicking the down-pointing arrow, as shown in Figure 1-5, expands the
dialog box so that you can navigate to a folder other than the one
GarageBand uses as its default, as shown in Figure 1-6.
GarageBand wants to save all new projects into the GarageBand folder,
which should be in your Music folder (which is in your Home folder).
This folder is installed automatically when you install GarageBand. If the
folder doesn’t exist when you save a new project, GarageBand creates a
new one for you automatically.

21
Chapter 1: In the Beginning: Introducing GarageBand

Also, the New Project dialog box appears in the same state as the last
time you saved a project. So if you had expanded the dialog box in the
past, it would look like Figure 1-6. And if you clicked the down-pointing
arrow as shown in Figure 1-6, the dialog box would again look like
Figure 1-5.
By the way, don’t worry about all that strange stuff you see in both 
versions of the New Project dialog box — namely tempo, time, bpm
(beats per minute), and key. You can read all about them in Chapters 6
through 8.
3. Okay . . . now click the Create button in the New Project dialog box.
The next thing you see is an empty GarageBand project (song) with a
single software instrument track (always the Grand Piano) created for

If the little piano isn’t on your screen, choose Window➪Keyboard or use
the keyboard shortcut Ô-K. If the little piano is on your screen and you
want it to go away, do the same. It’s a toggle. Each time you use it, the
little piano appears or disappears. Go ahead and try it a few times if you
like — you can’t hurt anything.
You can make the little piano wider by clicking and dragging its lower
right corner to the right.
Other interface elements shown in Figure 1-7 include:
• The Timeline: Shows where music appears after you record it or
drag it onto a track from the Loop Browser (not shown) or the
Finder (not shown either).
• The Tracks column: Displays the name of the current instrument.
• The Mixer column: Use the slide control to adjust the track’s
volume and the Pan control to manage its placement left, right, or
center in the stereo sound field.
• The Transport Controls (left to right): Record, Go to Beginning,
Rewind, Play/Pause, Fast Forward, and Cycle Region.
4. Finally (at least for this sneak peek), when you want to create a new
track, you choose Tracks➪New Track (or use the keyboard shortcut 
Ô-Option-N).
The New Track dialog box enables you to choose a real or software
instrument to assign to the new track, as shown in Figures 1-8 and 1-9.

Chapter 1: In the Beginning: Introducing GarageBand

The difference between software and real instruments is simple: Real
Instrument tracks contain things you record with a microphone (vocals,
acoustic guitar, flute, and so on) or by connecting the instrument to your Mac
(or an audio interface). Software Instrument tracks contain music that’s been
synthesized by GarageBand and recorded by playing notes on either the little
onscreen keyboard or an external MIDI keyboard.
That’s all you need to know for now. If you can’t wait to find out more,
Chapter 6 has more info on using software instruments; Chapters 7 and 8
have the scoop on using real instruments.

Equipping and Setting Up Your
Recording Space
In This Chapter
 Knowing the dos and don’ts for equipping your GarageBand studio
 Determining your needs
 Working with must-have gear
 Knowing some good-to-have gear
I
have some good news and some bad news. The good news first: Most of
you don’t have to spend a dime — assuming that you have GarageBand
installed on your Macintosh — to have lots of fun with GarageBand.
Many Mac models, including most Powerbooks, iBooks, and iMacs, come
equipped with everything you need. So if your Mac has speakers, a built-in
microphone, and a CD recorder (burner), you have everything it takes to use
GarageBand.
Now for the bad news: If you don’t spend another penny, you can still make
GarageBand songs, but their quality will be somewhat lacking. To make music
that sounds great, you need to invest a few additional bucks — or perhaps
even a few thousand additional bucks. Although I tell you what gear has the
most impact on your sound (and ways to stay within your budget), be pre-
pared to dip into your wallet more than once to get the best results from
GarageBand.
Cobbling Together a Studio (Without
Breaking the Bank)
You don’t have to spend a ton of money on equipment for your studio, espe-
cially when you’re first starting out with GarageBand. The least expensive way
to do something is often good enough. And should you outgrow an inexpensive

product, you can always find bigger, faster, and flashier ones that are priced
accordingly. Here are some tips for assembling a studio to meet your needs
but stay within your budget:
 When you start out, use the least expensive solution that you can find.
The microphones and speakers that are built into Macs aren’t very good
for making audio, but they’re good enough to use until you’re sure that
it’s worth spending money to do better.
 If you’re ready to take your gear up a notch but need to watch your
budget, see if you can borrow the gear to test it first or try to find
something used. If you have a friend who records music, see if he or she
has old microphones, keyboards, audio or MIDI interfaces, or speakers
that you can use. Most recording enthusiasts have a closet full of gear
that used to be good enough for them but isn’t anymore. This equipment
may be good enough for you.
 Remember that the term better is subjective. For example, a recording
microphone is one of the first investments that you’re likely to make.
(The free microphones and speakers on most Macs are a thoughtful
touch, and they are great for computing. However, for making music, the
built-in mics just aren’t good enough.) Is a $1,000 microphone better than
a $100 mic? Probably. Is it ten times better? That depends on who is
paying. To me, the answer is no. I have no microphones that cost over
$150, and they all work fine for the kind of work I do (demo quality
recording).
 Purchase your audio gear from vendors with reasonable return poli-
cies. You never know if a product is right until you use it in your studio. 
I prefer shopping with vendors that offer a 30-day (or even a two-week)
money-back guarantee. That way, I can return a product if I’m not happy
with it and receive a refund or a store credit.
Some vendors offer a money-back guarantee but also charge you a
restocking fee if you return the product. These fees can be substantial —
I’ve seen them as high as 25 percent of the purchase price. On the other
hand, while a restocking fee usually isn’t such a good deal, it’s often
better than being stuck with an expensive piece of gear that isn’t exactly
what you need.
 If you know you’re using GarageBand as a primer for more serious
recording, don’t skimp too much. This cheapest-first advice is just a
guideline. If you’re going to record a five-piece band live at some time,
consider buying gear that can handle that kind of workload, even if you
don’t need its capabilities today or if the gear has features that aren’t
useful in GarageBand but may be in other audio programs.
My advice to most of you: If you’re dabbling in audio production for the first
time, cheaper is better. Remember that advice, or you might spend way more
on audio gear than you need to.

Part I: Starting on a Good Note 

Making the Most of Your
Recording Space
Regardless of what you want to accomplish with GarageBand — singing a
cappella in the shower, making dance mixes culled from Apple Loops, or cre-
ating a band demo — a few truths should be held self-evident.
The first truth is to choose the most appropriate space in which to record. 
I do most of my recording in my home office. It’s not a very good recording
space: It has too many hard surfaces that reflect sound and cause echoes and
ugly resonation, and it doesn’t have enough soft things, such as curtains or
pillows, to absorb some of the sound that’s bouncing around. But it’s the
appropriate space for me to record because it’s where I have my computer,
guitars, keyboards, and other recording equipment. This leads me to my
second truth, which is to get rid of extra noise by deadening the room and
preventing outside noises as much as possible.
Deadening the room
Unless you’re recording an ensemble in a cathedral, (in which case the ambi-
ent reflected sound might be desirable), it’s in your best interest to deaden
the room you’re recording in as much as you can. Reflected sound is the
enemy when you’re recording, so if there are curtains, draw them to cover
those very sound-reflective windows. And set up your mic as far from hard
surfaces in the room (walls, windows, artwork, and so on) as possible.
The middle of a room is a good place to start.
Pillows, blankets, and even sheets can deaden your recording space at little
or no cost, but if you’re serious, you can spend hundreds (or even thou-
sands) of dollars on special sound-absorbing panels and freestanding
“gobos,” to deaden your studio.
According to my tech editor, Bryan Chaffin, you can also try the “wall of egg
cartons” technique. For this you need a bunch of cardboard egg cartons; the
commercial egg cartons used by food service establishments work best. You
can often find them at diner-style restaurants, or any restaurant that serves
breakfast. Just ask the manager; if one restaurant turns you down, keep trying.
After you’ve got a stash of egg cartons, string them together in a chain and
hang them from the ceiling or attach them to the walls with tape or glue as
needed.
27
Chapter 2: Equipping and Setting Up Your Recording Space

This is an inexpensive way to baffle your walls yet it (allegedly) offers excel-
lent results. I’ve never tried it but Bryan swears it works beautifully. He does
give a word of warning, though: Make sure you throw away any cartons with
egg left on them because they will begin to smell quite bad very quickly.
Preventing background noise
Always record in the quietest space that you can. If you’re recording an
acoustic instrument or vocal using a microphone, take extra steps to ensure
that the room is as quiet as possible. I have a routine, which is as follows:
1. Before I start a recording, I turn off all electronic equipment in my office
that isn’t involved in the session — television, radio, neon lamp, unused
Macs, and so on.
2. I switch off the central heating and air conditioning. When it’s running, 
I can hear it as clear as a bell in my recordings.
3. I silence both of my phones and my fax machine.
4. If I’m feeling ambitious, I may even put my dog out in the (fenced) back-
yard, which is as far from the office as possible. Then I tape a sign above
the doorbell: PLEASE DO NOT RING.
My method isn’t perfect, but if I do all these things before the first take, I usu-
ally avoid having my perfect take spoiled by background noise.
Equipping Your Studio: “Must-Have”
Gear versus “Good-to-Have” Gear
Gear falls into two categories: “must-have” gear and “good-to-have” gear —
especially if you’re just beginning to record music. The must-have equipment
includes things that you need to record audio and to basically use all of
GarageBand’s features. These must-have items don’t need to be expensive or
even high quality, and some of them may already by built into your Mac.
Here’s the bottom line: GarageBand won’t be as much fun without the follow-
ing things:
 Microphone(s)
 Stereo speakers or reference monitors
 Headphones
 A MIDI keyboard
28
Part I: Starting on a Good Note 

 The right cables and connectors
 Gobs of free space on your hard drive(s)
Good-to-have gear includes time- and effort-saving equipment and devices
that, while not strictly necessary, may be convenient or useful in your setup.
Place the following items on your good-to-have list:
 An analog audio interface
 Mic stands, pop filters, and wind screens
 A tuning device
I explain what all this equipment does and how you set it up in the following
sections. But my list here is incomplete by design. See Chapter 17 for the best
ways to take your recording to the next level. However, to cover every piece
of equipment that you may want to use in your GarageBand studio and to
describe what you would use that equipment for, I would have to write
another book roughly the size of this one. Fortunately, I don’t have to. Jeff
Strong has written just such a book, Home Recording For Musicians For
Dummies (published by Wiley). If you’re serious about making music, this is
the next book you should read (after you finish this book, of course).
Two virtual professional audio resources that you should know about 
are Sweetwater (www.sweetwater.com) and Musician’s Friend (www.
musiciansfriend.com). Both sites have extensive Web catalogs, so you 
can compare and contrast prices and features of multiple items. Or, if you’re
not a Web shopper and don’t already have a favorite pro audio dealer, visit
Guitar Center, probably the best known and largest brick-and-mortar audio
store. You can find a store in most major cities.
Choosing a Microphone
A microphone may be the most critical component that you buy. If you’re a
singer or want to record almost any acoustic instrument (guitar, piano, flute,
and so on), you need a microphone, and the quality of your recording will be
greatly influenced by your choice of mic.
My Webster’s Concise Electronic Dictionary defines a microphone as “an
instrument for transmitting or recording sound by changing sound waves
into variations of an electric current.” Technically, that’s not a bad definition,
but I prefer a simpler one: “A device that captures incoming sound and saves
it (as a tape recorder or GarageBand does) or transmits it (as a telephone or
walkie-talkie does).”
29
Chapter 2: Equipping and Setting Up Your Recording Space

Musicians and audio enthusiasts often refer to a microphone as a mic or
mike, both pronounced like the nickname for Michael. I use the full term
microphone most of the time, but I also like using mic. (It’s easier to type!) 
I never use mike. After all, I don’t want you to think I’m talking about a boxer
(Tyson), Monkee (Nesmith), or detective (Hammer).
I recommend that you begin by using any microphone that’s available. I’ve
made many GarageBand recordings using an old Andrea USB NC-7100, a
cheap USB mic that came bundled with speech-recognition software that 
I reviewed many years ago.
Many Macs have a built-in microphone and/or an audio input jack. Use the
built-in mic or connect a cheap mic to the audio-in jack, and make some
recordings. If they sound good to you, you just saved yourself a lot of money;
if they don’t sound good, buy or borrow a better microphone and re-record
the material. Now compare the two recordings and decide whether the better
mic is worth the money.
Microphones vary greatly in price and quality. You can pay as little as
$10–$20 for an inexpensive, consumer-quality mic at Radio Shack or Best Buy,
or you can spend thousands of dollars for a pro-quality mic at your local or
virtual pro audio dealer.
When it comes to microphones, price and sound quality don’t necessarily
correlate directly. You can find inexpensive microphones that sound as good
as (or better than) other microphones that cost three, five, or even ten times
as much. However, you generally get what you pay for, and more expensive
microphones usually sound better.
The main things to consider when choosing microphones are
 The type of mic (dynamic, condenser, or ribbon)
 The polarity pattern (cardioid, omni-directional, figure-8, and so on)
 Preamps
 Price (of course)
In the following sections, I explain these basic considerations and discuss
what you need to know about connecting a mic to your computer so that you
can start recording.
Dynamic and condenser microphones
Many types of microphones are available; they use many different mecha-
nisms and electronic components. The two types that you’re most likely to
encounter, though, are dynamic and condenser microphones. The technical
30
Part I: Starting on a Good Note 

differences in the way that each type works aren’t important (at least not in
this chapter), but you should know the following nontechnical differences
between the two before you consider choosing one kind (or both):
 Dynamic mics are generally less expensive than condenser types.
 Condenser mics generally reproduce vocals and acoustic instruments
more accurately and with more “warmth.” (Warmth is a desirable tonal
characteristic that might best be described as mellow or not bright. It
refers to a pleasant decrease in mid and mid/high frequencies that make
a voice or instrument sound smoother when recorded.)
 Dynamic mics can be placed closer to loud bursts of sound — such as
drums or a guitar amp — than condenser mics, so dynamic mics may
achieve a sound that you just can’t get with a condenser mic. Furthermore,
a condenser mic is more likely to be damaged by extremely loud sounds
than a dynamic mic.
 Many dynamic mics are built for rough use — they better withstand
being dropped on the floor or being knocked over with a mic stand. If
you’re rough on your gear or plan to use it in a live stage setting, a
dynamic mic will probably last longer.
 Condenser mics require a power source (known as phantom power), so
they must contain an internal battery or have the phantom power sup-
plied through the cable by your audio interface or mixer.
Not all audio interfaces and mixers supply phantom power to condenser mics.
If you plan to use one of these mics, make sure that the device you’re going to
connect it to — for example, an audio interface, mixer, or sound card — pro-
vides phantom power for it.
There is a third type of microphone — the ribbon mic — but they’re fragile,
expensive ($1,000 and up), and while ribbon mics are prized for a silky
response, they don’t sound that different from condenser mics. You probably
want to avoid ribbon mics unless you’re a purist and have some very deep
pockets. I’ve recorded with a ribbon mic in a studio many years ago and it
did indeed sound silky. But so did the Neumann U87 (around $2,500), which
was (and still is) the gold standard for condenser mics.
If you buy only one microphone, you can’t go wrong with a dynamic mic such
as the Shure SM57 or SM58. These are two of the most popular dynamic mics
around and have been for at least 20 years.
The SM57 and SM58 are very similar, but the SM57 has “contoured frequency
response for clean sound reproduction of amplified and acoustic instru-
ments,” whereas the SM58 is “tuned to accentuate the warmth and clarity of
lead and back-up vocals.” The SM58 is the ball-shaped mic you see all the
time on stage and in videos.
31
Chapter 2: Equipping and Setting Up Your Recording Space

The differences between the SM57 and SM58 are small and you may not even
be able to hear them. Either is fine for both vocals and instruments. So, if you’re
only buying one, first decide which is more important to you, recording vocals
or recording instruments, and choose accordingly. You can buy either one
from online music vendors such as Sweetwater Sound (www.sweetwater.com)
and Musician’s Friend (www.musiciansfriend.com) for around $100.
Microphone polarity patterns
Each microphone is designed with a specific polarity pattern, which, in plain
English, means that they pick up sound from certain locations better than
others. The three polarity patterns you’re most likely to encounter are
 Cardioid (directional): Cardioid mics, as you can see in Figure 2-1, reject
sound from the rear and sides, making them excellent for recording an
instrument or vocal with little or no extraneous sound leakage.
 Omni-directional: Omni-directional mics pick up sound from all direc-
tions equally, as you can see in Figure 2-2. That makes them a fine choice
for recording a large ensemble or orchestra, but not the best choice for
recording individual voices and instruments, which is what you do in
GarageBand most of the time.
 Figure-8 (bi-directional): The figure-8 pattern picks up sound from the
front and back equally, while rejecting sound coming from either side, as
shown in Figure 2-3.
This will be easier to show than tell, so take a look at Figures 2-1, 2-2, and 2-3.
These are “polar graphs” that show how well the mic picks up sound from
the front, rear, and sides. The specification sheets for most microphones will
include a polar graph of its polarity pattern.

The three flavors of cardioid are so similar and you won’t notice much 
(if any) difference between them for the kind of recording you’re likely to do
when working with GarageBand. I merely include this information so you
won’t be confused when you start seeing these terms in brochures and
reviews.
Microphone preamps
You have one last thing to consider if you’re buying a microphone — your
mic preamps have a tremendous effect on how your mic will sound.
A mic preamp amplifies the sound coming out of the microphone to the
higher voltage known as line level, because mixers, tape recorders, GarageBand,
and almost anything else you might use a decent microphone with, requires
line level input for recording.

Chapter 2: Equipping and Setting Up Your Recording Space

If your microphone plugs directly into the Mac’s audio in port, you’re using
the built-in audio preamps, which are lower quality than most outboard gear
but certainly good enough for GarageBand work in a pinch.
If you purchase an external audio interface, chances are it will tout its own
preamp circuits; all of these will provide a cleaner signal than your Mac’s
built-in audio-in subsystem.
Setting up your microphone
Many Macs have a built-in microphone and/or an audio input jack. A built-in
mic requires no extra work on your part. You may be able to simply connect
a cheap mic to the audio-in jack and make some recordings.
However, most quality microphones (dynamic and condenser), as well as many
other pieces of audio gear that you’re likely to encounter, use cables with XLR

connectors (shown later in Figure 2-11). Because your Mac has no built-in
XLR ports, you can’t plug an XLR cable directly into a Mac. If you choose a
microphone with an XLR connector, you also need another piece of audio
gear — an audio interface, internal sound card, mixer, or other device — that
has XLR inputs. This device can send its output to your Mac through one of
its built-in ports, such as FireWire, USB, PCI (Power Macs only), or PC card
(Powerbooks only).
I cover cables, jacks, plugs, ports, and connectors in the section, “Unraveling
the Cable and Connector Conundrum,” later in this chapter. For more on
audio interfaces, see the section, “Adding an Audio Interface to Your Setup,”
also later in this chapter.
Finding the Right Speakers
Choosing the speakers that you use to listen to your GarageBand work is
almost as important as selecting the right microphone. The perfect recording
never sounds good in your car, on your home stereo, or on your iPod if you
don’t use speakers that accurately reproduce the sound when you mix and
master.
That said, you don’t have to spend a bundle on speakers. The built-in speakers
in your iMac or eMac may be as good as you need for the kind of work that you
plan to do.
If the built-in speakers aren’t good enough, almost any set of computer 
multimedia speakers is a major improvement. I’m currently using the Telex/
ElectroVoice EV Sonic XJR Hardcore Multimedia Speaker System (www.
telex.com), which is an inexpensive, three-piece set made up of two desktop
speakers and one larger subwoofer. I’ve used many multimedia speaker sys-
tems with my Macs over the years, and the EV Sonic XJRs deliver a lot of bang
for the buck. They are really inexpensive — around $100 — but they sound as
good as some speaker systems that cost twice (or thrice) as much.
ElectroVoice is a legend in club and concert sound, so the XJR speakers and
subwoofer look like the monitors that sit on the stage when your favorite
band performs, but they are much smaller. The units have volume and sub-
woofer knobs and a blue LED power light on the left speaker, and they look
quite cool on my desk.
Finally, if you’re really serious about recording, you will probably want to buy
a studio-style speaker system. These systems reproduce audio so accurately
that they are called reference monitors or near-field reference monitors.
M-Audio (www.m-audio.com) sells several inexpensive reference monitor
systems. I recently evaluated the company’s Studiophile LX4 2.1 system (two
35
Chapter 2: Equipping and Setting Up Your Recording Space

speakers and a subwoofer), and all I can say is, “Wow!” I thought my XJR
system sounded darned good, but the LX4 system, which costs less than
$300, sounds even better — a lot better.
The LX4 is also the only reference monitor system that can be upgraded to a
surround-sound (5.1) system. If that’s your desire, you just add the M-Audio
LX4 5.1 Expander kit, which provides the three additional speakers for less
than $200.
Figure 2-4 shows a single LX4 speaker.
I love my EV Sonic XJR system, and the price was right, but for under $300,
the LX4s sound so much better that I’m going to buy them as soon as I can
afford another audio purchase. I don’t use surround sound, so I won’t need to
buy the Expander kit, but it’s nice to know that for another $200 I could have
five-channel sound.
One last thing: I just tested Tapco’s S-5 Active Studio Monitors, which are
Mackie-designed active desktop monitors with dual high-precision internal
amplifiers.
Mackie is one of the most famous producers of mixing boards and other pro-
fessional recording gear; Tapco is their consumer products division. So it’s no
surprise that the S-5 monitors sound better than many reference monitors
costing more.
Figure 2-4:

M-Audio’s

36
Part I: Starting on a Good Note 

Speaking of price, while the S-5s cost more than the LX4s (around $400) and
don’t provide an option for expanding the system to 5.1 surround sound, they
do sound spectacular and may be a better choice, depending upon your needs
and budget. Check them out at www.tapcogear.com.
Now I’m not sure which to buy: LX4s or S-5s. Either way, I can’t go wrong —
both systems are far better than the EV Sonic XJRs I’m using now.
Listening with Headphones (Without
Messing Up the Take)
If you intend to use any kind of microphone while you record a voice or
instrument, you can’t use your speakers or reference monitors while you
sing or play. This would almost certainly cause ear-shattering feedback.
When you use microphones, you need to listen to other tracks in cans. This is
studio talk for headphones, as in “Put on that pair of cans and sing a few bars.”
You don’t need to use expensive headphones, but whatever kind you choose,
make sure that they don’t leak sound that can be picked up by the microphone.
The sound may not cause feedback, but it will spoil the track if you’re picky
about things like that — and I am.
Ask your friends what they recommend, but avoid any headphones with open
foam for earpieces. I have a pair of Grado SR-60 headphones that are the
greatest $60 headphones I’ve ever owned. But they are not acceptable for
recording, because the ear cups are made of a loose type of foam that leaks
too much sound for recording purposes.
I used to do a radio show from my home office, and the engineers at the sta-
tion (CNET, before it went off the air) recommended Sony MDR-V600 head-
phones. They cost less than $100, have leather-like earpieces that seal in the
sound nicely, sound darned good, and are comfortable for extended periods
of wearing.
If you own an iPod, try using the earbuds that came with it. If you don’t set
the listening level of the tracks that you’re playing too high, these earbuds
work pretty well. But Apple’s $39 In-Ear Headphones are better: They have
better bass response and three different-sized ear caps. You get a snug fit
that seals in more sound than the standard iPod units (or most other ear-
buds, for that matter).
Earbud-type headphones are shown in Figure 2-5.
37
Chapter 2: Equipping and Setting Up Your Recording Space

Adding a MIDI Keyboard to Your Setup
If you play the piano or organ and want to record GarageBand’s software
instruments well (or at least not one note at a time using GarageBand’s 
on-screen keyboard, which is shown in Figure 1-1), you should buy a MIDI
Figure 2-5:
Earbuds are
headphones
like this,

38
Part I: Starting on a Good Note 

keyboard. This keyboard can send information about what you’re playing in
a format that your computer can understand. (See the sidebar “MIDI this,
MIDI that: What the heck is a MIDI anyway?” for details).
Finding a keyboard
You may already have a MIDI keyboard. Look around your house and the
houses of close friends for anything that has piano-like keys. I discovered an
old Miracle Piano that my kids used many years ago had MIDI in and out
ports. That meant that I could have used it with GarageBand (with the proper
cables and/or MIDI interface), but it was a little too grimy and missing a
bunch of keys.
The Apple stores — both physical and online — sell the M-Audio Keystation
49e. This is a nice 49-key, velocity-sensitive MIDI keyboard, as shown in
Figure 2-6, that costs just $99.
I’m not a trained keyboard player, but the Keystation 49e feels like a keyboard
to me, even though the keys are made of plastic. My musician friends tell me
that it doesn’t compare to their expensive keyboards, which have special
weighted keys that are made from the same material that real piano keys are
made of. But even they agree that for nonkeyboardists, the M-Audio
Keystation 49e is a good keyboard and a great value.

Chapter 2: Equipping and Setting Up Your Recording Space
MIDI this, MIDI that: What the
heck is a MIDI anyway?
MIDI is the acronym for Musical Instrument
Digital Interface. It’s an industry standard that
has been used by almost all musical software
and hardware. A device that conforms to the
MIDI standard can send and receive musical
information.
A MIDI keyboard doesn’t send sound; it sends
messages that GarageBand (or other audio
programs) can then translate into sounds. If
you were recording and pressed the middle
C key very softly, waited 1 second, released
the key, waited another second, then struck theD
key above it with all your might and held the
D key for 4 seconds, your MIDI keyboard would
send a message something like this to
GarageBand:
 At time 00.00, play middle C with a velocity
of 17 percent and sustain it for 1 second.
 At time 02.00, play the D above middle C
with a velocity of 98 percent and sustain it
for 4 seconds.
That’s a gross oversimplification. The MIDI
standard lets a device send and receive much
more information than just pitch, velocity, and
sustain. But that’s all you need to know for
now — you play the MIDI keyboard, and
GarageBand memorizes what you played.

I paid a bit more and bought a different M-Audio MIDI keyboard, called the
Oxygen 8 (see Figure 2-7).
The Oxygen 8 has fewer keys (it only has 25) than the Keystation 49e and a
bunch of knobs that don’t work (at least not at this time) with GarageBand.
So why did I pay more for a keyboard with fewer keys and knobs that don’t
work? I’ll give you four good reasons, as follows:
 The Oxygen 8 is portable.
 The knobs work in some other programs.
 The keyboard was on sale and included a padded carrying case.

 Most importantly, with my iCurve Invisible Laptop Stand ($39.99; www.

directly under my Powerbook, saving lots of desk space when I’m not
playing it.
Connecting a MIDI keyboard 
to your computer
Most modern MIDI keyboards connect to your Mac via a USB port. Years ago,
however, setting up a keyboard wasn’t so simple. Only a few years ago, MIDI
devices used special MIDI cables. Unfortunately, Macs have never been made
with special MIDI cable ports.
The solution to this problem was to use a small box called a MIDI interface, as
shown in Figure 2-8. You plugged a thick, expensive MIDI cable (or cables)
into the MIDI port(s), plugged a USB cable (or an AppleTalk or LocalTalk
cable in the very old days) into the USB port, and then connected the other
end of the USB cable to your Mac.
Fortunately, most modern MIDI devices (typically keyboards, but many
instruments including MIDI guitars and MIDI drums can send and receive
MIDI) have their own USB port and often have two or more MIDI ports as
well, so you don’t need a separate MIDI interface to use these devices.

Chapter 2: Equipping and Setting Up Your Recording Space

MIDI devices require driver software to operate properly. If you don’t install
their driver software — or install it improperly — the device probably won’t
work.
I purposely skipped this driver installation step in the previous MIDI interface
discussion. I didn’t want to add to your confusion, because the sequence in
which you install the driver makes a difference to many devices.
The driver installers for most MIDI devices come on a CD-ROM, which should
also include a “read me” document or manual, usually in PDF (Portable
Document File) format. Some devices even include a printed manual or a
Getting Started guide. You should review all of these documents, because
they may contain important information about how to install the drivers.
Read them before you launch the installer program.
Why is it so important to read before launching? Some MIDI devices must
be plugged in before installing their drivers; other devices cannot be plugged
in before installing their drivers. And many MIDI devices don’t give a hoot
either way.
Because you never know how long the device has been sitting on a shelf,
Mac power users always check the device maker’s Web site before installing
drivers from the included CD. If newer drivers have become available, they
almost always fix bugs, work better, and are more reliable than the drivers
on the CD. The same goes for old devices you have lying around the house
or studio: Always check the manufacturer’s Web site for the latest driver
software and instructions on installing it before you attempt to connect the
device to your Mac.
If you install the drivers incorrectly, the device won’t work. It’s frustrating,
but it’s easily avoided: Just RTFM (that’s Read the Fine Manual) before you
launch the installer.
Unraveling the Cable and
Connector Conundrum
Nothing is more frustrating than having a cool new toy and not having the
proper cable to connect it to your Mac. Your Mac only has so many holes
(that is, ports) that you can stick things into — and so do most pieces of
audio gear. Unfortunately, the holes in your Mac don’t always accept cables
that fit the holes in your audio gear. But with a little cable-and-connector
know-how, hooking up your gear should be pretty easy. Table 2-1 gives you an
overview of the common connectors and cables and indicates how to plug
them into your Mac. The rest of this section explains how to recognize each
cable and connector and describes what you need to know about them.

Mono and stereo plugs. These plugs can be confusing for two reasons: They
look almost alike, and they come in two different sizes. Note the following
examples:
 The audio-out port (for headphones and speakers) mates with a stereo
minijack plug, known as an 1⁄8-inch stereo plug at your local Radio Shack.
 The audio-in port (for microphones and instruments) is a mono minijack,
or an 1⁄8-inch mono plug at Radio Shack.
 Electric guitars and other electronic instruments use 1⁄4-inch mono plugs,
as shown in Figure 2-9.
 Many good headphones and other electronic devices use a 1⁄4-inch plug
as well, but they use a stereo 1⁄4-inch plug.
The size difference is fairly easy to figure out: 1⁄8-inch plugs are smaller and fit
into your existing ports and 1⁄4-inch plugs don’t. But how do you tell the differ-
ence between mono and stereo plugs? Stereo plugs have two rings, and mono
plugs only have one.
Look at Figure 2-9, a 1⁄4-inch mono plug, and compare it to Figure 2-10, a stereo
plug. Notice the two rings on the stereo plug and the single ring on the mono
plug. The two-ring/one-ring deal applies to the minijacks (1⁄8-inch plugs) as
well. Always make sure that the plug you shove into a given port is the right
one for the job.

Stereo comes out of two speakers. Stereo plugs have two rings.
XLR connectors. XLR cables and connectors are yet another kind that you’re
likely to encounter, particularly if you use higher-quality audio gear such as
microphones (mentioned earlier in this chapter) and mixing boards. Two XLR
connectors are shown in Figure 2-11.
S/PDIF connectors. S/PDIF (Sony/Phillips Digital Interface Format) is becom-
ing more popular and is now supported by many inexpensive devices. As of
this writing, the Power Mac G5 is the only Mac with built-in S/PDIF ports.
If you have a G5 with S/PDIF in and out audio ports, you should use them if
you have gear with S/PDIF connectors. Because S/PDIF is fiber-optic cable, it
adds the least noise to audio that passes through it.
XLR cables are quieter than other types of analog cable and are less likely to
add hiss, static, or hum to your recording. But the quietest cable of all may
be the S/PDIF.
RCA jacks. Finally, many consumer audio products, as well as some com-
puter audio products, use RCA jacks. These jacks, shown in Figure 2-12, are
also known (at least in the old days) as phono plugs.
Here’s the best tip in this section: Radio Shack is a great place to solve cable
dilemmas. The Shack has adapters or cables that do just about anything that
you can think of. Do you need to connect two mono 1⁄8-inch cables to a single
1⁄8-inch stereo jack? Radio Shack sells cables and adapters for that. Do you
need a male connector when all you have are female connectors? No problem;
Radio Shack has gender switchers for most plugs. Do you need a cable with
one type of plug on one end and a different connector on the other? Chances
are that Radio Shack has it or has a plug converter that you can use.

Chapter 2: Equipping and Setting Up Your Recording Space

Every guitarist should have one cable — a 1⁄4-inch mono female–to–1⁄8-inch
stereo male minijack. Plug the male end into your Mac’s audio-in port, and
connect your guitar cable to the female end. Now you can play your guitar in
GarageBand without additional hardware (some of which is covered in the
next section).
Apple sells a Monster Instrument Adapter, an expensive 1⁄4-inch mono
female–to–1⁄8-inch stereo male adapter, for $19.95. I bought one and it works
fine, but it adds more noise to guitar recordings than any of my analog audio
interfaces. But it’s not noticeably better or worse than a similar adapter I got
at Radio Shack for under $5. (I discuss this further in the next section.)
Adding an Audio Interface to Your Setup
While you can usually rig a cable to connect various devices to your Mac,
sometimes you need better quality than jury-rigged cables can provide. Or,
maybe you have other audio software that’s capable of recording more than
one track at a time. (GarageBand limits you to recording a single track at a
time; most other audio programs don’t impose this limitation if your hard-
ware supports more than one audio input.)
Using an interface with GarageBand
With GarageBand, an audio interface is most commonly used for microphones
(or other devices) with those pesky professional XLR connectors. Like a MIDI
interface does for MIDI instruments, an audio interface acts as a bridge between
the XLR cable port that your Mac doesn’t have and the USB port that it does
Figure 2-12:

nents.

have. An analog audio interface can also help you use other connectors that
your Mac doesn’t have a port for — for example, 1⁄4-inch mono and/or stereo
plugs and several other types of plugs, depending on the interface you choose.
(See the section, “Unraveling the Cable and Connector Conundrum,” earlier
in this chapter, if you’re not sure what all these plugs are for.)
Audio interfaces come in all shapes and sizes and many combinations of
inputs and outputs. The following two main types are available:
 FireWire interfaces, which plug into your FireWire port
 USB interfaces, which plug into your USB port
FireWire interfaces are usually capable of more than one or two channels of
input or output at a time. (This matters not a whit to GarageBand, which
records one and only one track at a time.) FireWire devices are faster than
USB interfaces, although that doesn’t matter to GarageBand either. The USB
interfaces that I’ve tested have been plenty fast enough and have the inputs
and outputs that I use — XLR plugs for microphones and 1⁄4-inch mono plugs
for guitars.
Shopping for an interface
If you would like to use an interface with GarageBand, think about whether
you want to stick with GarageBand or whether you should move up to higher-
end software. Buying the right interface for your needs will save you a lot of
money. Keep the following points in mind:
 For GarageBand, choose the least expensive audio interface that does
what you need. Otherwise, you end up paying for features that
GarageBand doesn’t support. And, if you’re on a tight budget, make do
with microphones and instruments that you can plug into the Mac’s
audio-in port and avoid anything with an XLR connector.
 On the other hand, if you plan to someday move up to more sophisti-
cated recording software, a more capable (and more expensive) audio
interface may be worth it; those other programs can record 4, 8, 16, or
more tracks at a time!
An interface for GarageBand only
M-Audio (www.m-audio.com) and Edirol (www.edirol.com) offer the widest
selections of USB and FireWire interfaces. If you want an interface just for
GarageBand, the inexpensive ones should have everything you need. For
example, you get the following with the M-Audio Mobile Pre USB, which sells
for around $150 and is shown in Figure 2-13:
47
Chapter 2: Equipping and Setting Up Your Recording Space

 2 XLR inputs with 48V phantom power: This is the port that you need
for a higher-end microphone, complete with the phantom power.
 1 stereo microphone input (1⁄8-inch)
 2 instrument/line inputs (1⁄4-inch): These inputs are ideal for connecting
guitars and basses.
 2 line outputs (1⁄4-inch)
 1 stereo line output (1⁄8-inch)
 1 stereo headphone output (1⁄8-inch): For adjusting the volume of what
you hear in the headphones.
 Bus-powered: This means it gets all the power it needs from your USB
port; that means you don’t have to lug around a power brick, which is
particularly nice if you use the interface with a Powerbook or iBook.
These features are pretty good for the low end of M-Audio’s product line; the
features are probably all that most of you will need for a while.
An interface for other recording software
As much as I hate to admit it, if you’re serious about recording, you’re going
to outgrow GarageBand, and its limitations will frustrate you — probably
sooner than later. In this case, you should consider another audio interface.
This interface is Digidesign’s Mbox, another USB audio interface with an
array of inputs and outputs that’s similar to M-Audio’s $150 Mobile Pre USB. 
I have a Digidesign Mbox, and it works great with GarageBand, but it’s three
times the price of the Mobile Pre USB, at around $450. The Mbox may be
worth considering for one reason alone: It comes with Digidesign’s popular
Pro Tools LE software (and a bunch of other useful software, including
AmpliTube LE, the coolest guitar/amp modeler I know).
Figure 2-13:
M-Audio’s

48
Part I: Starting on a Good Note 

Pro Tools is a standard in the audio recording industry; some Pro Tools sys-
tems cost $100,000. Mbox is the entry-level Pro Tools offering, but it sports
the same interface as the $20,000 (and up) Pro Tools TDM systems. If you
buy the Mbox now to use as your audio interface with GarageBand, when
you are ready for a more powerful program, you’ll have it already — Pro
Tools LE. See Chapter 17 for more on Pro Tools and other more advanced
recording software.
Perfecting Your Mic Setup
If you’re using microphones to record, supplementing your mic setup can
help you get a better recording. The obvious addition to your mic is a mic
stand. If you’re recording vocals, pop filters and wind screens can also help
you get a better take.
Choosing a mic stand
I have two or three mic stands, and they are all cheapies — bought on sale at
one of Guitar Center’s Super Savings Spectacular Sale-a-Thon promotions.
Figure 2-14 shows a boom-style mic stand on the left and a straight stand on
the right.
I prefer booms; they are more flexible when placing the mic. When you’re
recording using a microphone (and you’re going to hear me say this time and
again), mic placement is critical. Placement two inches one way or the other
could mean the difference between an award-winning take and a pile of
garbage. The boom stands make it a lot easier to place the mic exactly where
you want it. The downside is that they tip over easily, and I’ve tipped them
over more times than I care to remember. I’ve also whacked myself in the
head with both ends of the boom — more than once. So be careful; those mic
stands are inherently unstable critters.
I think the straight stands are better on stage than in the studio.
If you’re on a tight budget, duct tape is a cheap alternative to the mic stand.
Tape your mic to an object that’s big and heavy enough so that it doesn’t
vibrate while you’re recording. Or, prop the mic on pillows that you pile on a
chair and point the mic at the sound hole of your acoustic guitar. You can
also dangle a mic from the ceiling. (It’s not good for the cable, but it may
sound cool.) The point is this: Use your imagination. When it comes to how
and where to position a mic, no consensus exists and anything goes.

Part I: Starting on a Good Note 

Recording vocals with pop filters
and wind screens
Two more tools that pros use for their recordings are pop filters and wind
screens.
A pop filter is a thin piece of cloth (usually nylon) stretched over a frame
that’s slightly larger than the microphone itself. This idea is that the pop
filter minimizes the popping sound created when you pronounce, for exam-
ple, the letter “P.” Place the filter 4–6 inches from the mic, and even the most
plosive p-poppin’ vocalist will sound less percussive.
You can make a pop filter from a wire coat hanger and panty hose, or you can
buy a ready-made filter at most music stores for about $25. Make them or buy
them, but use them for most vocals. These filters almost always improve
your sound, even if your vocalist doesn’t pop his or her Ps.
Along the same lines, but less important in studio work, are wind screens.
Like pop filters, wind screens keep unwanted noise from entering the mic.
When a television newscaster shoves a microphone in someone’s face, the
foam ball that you see is the wind screen that covers the microphone.
A wind screen can help with plosive Ps, but a pop filter usually works better
for that issue. A wind screen may also muffle what you are recording more
than a pop filter. I use the pop filter for all vocals and rarely use a wind
screen, but if you have a wind screen, try it and see if you like it.
Boosting Your Hard Drive Space
Something you can’t do without is plenty of free space on your hard drive —
internal or external. GarageBand and its attendant files are huge, and a single
song can use hundreds of megabytes of space. The more you use
GarageBand, the faster your hard drive will become full enough to cause you
problems.
Mac OS X doesn’t like it when the startup (boot) drive is nearly full. This con-
dition may slow your Mac’s performance, affect your ability to record in
GarageBand, or both. My guideline is to leave at least 10 percent of my
startup drive free; bad things can happen if you let the hard drive get much
fuller.
51
Chapter 2: Equipping and Setting Up Your Recording Space

In Chapter 1, I mention that if your hard drive gets too full, one option is to
purchase an external FireWire drive. My top two reasons why external
FireWire drives are better than internal ones are as follows:
 If a FireWire drive has problems, you don’t have to open your Mac to get
at your drive or to replace the drive. With a FireWire device, you merely
connect the replacement drive to your Mac and plug in its power supply,
and you’re back up and running.
 FireWire drives are bootable, so you can use one hard drive with more
than one Mac and have all your stuff just the way you like it. If you use
more than one Mac — like a Powerbook and a desktop — being able to
easily use the drive with either computer is a plus.
 If you compose or record with friends, you can just take the FireWire
drive containing the GarageBand session files to their house instead of
lugging your whole Mac.
The internal hard drive in my old Power Mac G4 died, and I didn’t replace it
for months. I simply used FireWire drives exclusively.
I know I’m getting ahead of myself, but while I’m talking about drives, you
should probably hear this now. With audio applications other than
GarageBand, you are strongly recommended to save your project files on a
drive other than your startup (boot) drive. You get better performance from
many audio applications by storing your projects on a nonboot drive and
GarageBand is no exception, so if you’ve got a second (or third, fourth, or
fifth) hard drive, use it to save your GarageBand projects instead of saving
them to your startup drive.
Recording in Tune with a Tuning Device
(for Guitarists)
Last but not least, if you’re a guitarist or you play any instrument that is tun-
able, you should get some type of digital tuner and use it before each and
every recording you make. The computer isn’t very forgiving. If you record a
piece when your instrument is out of tune, it’s never going to sound as good
as if you had tuned up first, no matter how hard you try. That’s because
GarageBand’s software instruments never play off-key.
Some other audio programs (for example, the eMedia guitar lesson series and
AmpliTube Live) include on-screen tuners that work pretty well. If you have a
tuner that came with other software, use the tuner before you launch
GarageBand to record. If you don’t already have a good tuner, be sure to get
one before you record.

So, if you already know how you like to set your preferences, feel free to skip
the rest of this chapter. You’ll miss a couple of important warnings and a few
bits of low humor, but not much else.
For the rest of you — and especially those of you new to GarageBand — I was
being facetious with the chapter title. You probably don’t know how you like
your preferences, at least not yet. But you will in just a few short pages. This
chapter helps you adjust each item in every preference pane, accompanied
by the usual wit and wisdom and whatever else that I think you may find
helpful.
Some of you may think that I’m putting the cart before the horse by covering
preferences in Chapter 3, because the features that these preferences affect
aren’t introduced until Parts II or III. But there’s a method to my madness.
I’m just going to take a quick look at every one of the little critters (that is,
the preference panes and settings) so that you know what they are, where
they are, and how to configure them appropriately. For many of you, I’m
hoping to do this before you try and make music that matters.
The General Pane: No Pain, in General
General, meet the readers; readers, meet (the) General (pane). Using the
General pane is generally pretty painless. I examine each option, starting
at the top. To get to the General pane, choose GarageBand➪Preferences
(keyboard shortcut: Ô-,) and make sure that General is selected in the
navigation bar at the top of the Preferences window.
Metronome radio buttons
The General pane has the following Metronome radio buttons at its top: the
During Recording and the During Playback and Recording radio buttons.
To make a choice that suits you, here are some tips to keep in mind:
 To play or sing “in time” with a song’s time signature, tempo, and
other tracks, use the Metronome every time that you record a track.
Just remember that YMMV (your mileage may vary). Some musicians
have perfect time and can literally play entire pieces without missing a
beat. I’m such a lousy musician that I can’t stay in time, even with the
Metronome clicking away.
54
Part I: Starting on a Good Note 

 You may prefer to toggle the Metronome on and off — something that
I do often. To do so, choose Control➪Metronome or press Ô-U. You can
tell whether the Metronome is on (without listening) by looking for a
check mark before Metronome in the Control menu. If it is on and you
choose Control➪Metronome or press Ô-U again, the check mark disap-
pears and the metronome shuts up.
 You can’t toggle the Metronome on and off during recording or play-
back. If you try to, GarageBand does receive your message. It just doesn’t
do anything about it until you stop or pause the recording or playback.
When you click the Play button or press the spacebar, the song begins to
play and you hear (or don’t hear) the Metronome.
When I start a new project, I use the Metronome during playback to rehearse
parts without recording them and to try out different tempos for a piece. But
as soon as I’ve got drum and/or bass tracks — and maybe a guitar or key-
board part or two — I turn the Metronome off and leave it off. By this point,
the other tracks should be in time with each other, so I should be able to
keep time with them when I’m playing or singing, without the annoying tick of
the Metronome in my ear.
As the song’s track count increases, it gets harder to hear the Metronome
anyway. That’s why you may want to record your rhythm tracks — mostly
drums and/or bass — first.
Just know that the Metronome is there if you want it, during recording or
playback. It can be turned on and off in a heartbeat from the Control menu by
pressing its keyboard shortcut — that is, unless that heart happens to beat
while you’re playing or recording.
Do not choose Control➪Metronome or press Ô-U a second time before you
pause/stop the song. If you do, you’ll undo what you just did, which would
lead you to believe that nothing happened. But something did happen — it
just happened twice, putting it back the way it was.
As of version 1.0.1, GarageBand acts this way. I hope this is changed in later
versions; I don’t like stopping what may be a perfectly good take (which can
be quite rare for me) just to turn the Metronome on and off.
If you’re playing or recording, follow these steps to toggle the metronome on
or off:
1. Press the spacebar (to pause recording or playback).
2. Press Ô-U (to turn the Metronome on or off).
3. Press the spacebar (to start playback) or press R (to start recording).

you see a warning message (shown in Figure 3-2) after you make changes to
an instrument or preset and attempt to switch to another instrument or
preset.
By default, this warning is on — and with good reason. Although Part II is
really the place to find out about tweaking software instruments and presets,
I walk you through this process now so that you understand why I think it’s
important to leave this option selected.
After I spent an hour working with the settings of the Grand Piano, adjusting
equalization, echo, and other settings so that it sounded superb to my ear, I
accidentally tried to switch to a different instrument, and the lifesaving warn-
ing shown in Figure 3-2 saved my bacon.
The warning shown in Figure 3-2 wouldn’t have been any help if I weren’t
paying attention. The default button in the warning dialog box is Don’t Save.
If you aren’t paying attention and click this button (or press Return), you lose
any changes that you’ve made to the instrument or preset.

Part I: Starting on a Good Note 

Because I liked the way my Grand Piano sounded, I did want to save my set-
tings, so I clicked the Save button, and the dialog box shown in Figure 3-3
popped up.
The dialog box in Figure 3-3 is another one with which you need to proceed
with caution. The default button in the Save Instrument dialog box (Figure 3-3)
is Save. If you click the Save button without typing a new name, you lose the
fantastic Grand Piano that came with GarageBand — the one that was config-
ured by a professional musician and/or producer and is one of the nicest
things about GarageBand. You’ll still have your tweaked Grand Piano, for
better or worse, but the original made-by-a-genuine-audio-pro Grand Piano is
gone (at least until you reinstall GarageBand or replace it from a backup).
I really like GarageBand’s Grand Piano. My piano may sound good to me now,
but I sure don’t want to replace that trained professional’s Grand Piano. And in
a few days, I’m likely to think that mine sounds like — well, like it isn’t so good.
Always rename your instruments or presets before you click the Save button
to save them. As shown in Figure 3-4, I append a descriptive word or two to
the instrument’s original name so that I can tell what instrument it is sup-
posed to sound like.
If you later decide that your changes aren’t as good as you thought, you can
always delete them.
You may not know how to save an instrument or preset yet (a task that I
explain in Part II). But this is another occasion where the sooner you get
the right info, the less likely you are to lose the good stuff to carelessness,
inattention, or accident. Blowing away a default instrument or preset isn’t

the end of the world, but it can be a hassle to undo. Unfortunately, the Undo
command doesn’t work after you click the Save button in the Save Instrument
dialog box.
The good news is that you can work around this minefield of dialog boxes:
When you’ve painstakingly tweaked the settings for an instrument or preset,
and everything is just the way you like it, save your settings right away by
clicking the Save button in the Track Info window. Although we all lose useful
stuff occasionally, you’ll lose less good stuff if you save it immediately each
time you tweak a preset and are happy with the result.
Anyway, as the punch line to a joke I’ve long forgotten goes, “Don’t do dat!”
Keyword browsing
The Filter for More Relevant Results check box does exactly what it says: If
you deselect this check box, you see more loops, but many of them don’t
sound good in your song.
It may seem that finding more loops would be a good thing, but resist the
temptation — it’s not. Try it if you have the time, and you’ll see my point.
I always keep this check box selected. You can deselect yours if you like, but
if you do, I hope you enjoy spending quality time with loops that sound lousy
in your composition.
’Nuff said.

Part I: Starting on a Good Note 

Resetting the keyword layout
The Loop Browser (which I cover in detail in Chapter 5) uses keywords
to describe the sounds that are in the loops. The keywords are on buttons
(in one of the Loop Browser’s two views) and can be easily customized. The
Reset button fixes your mess when you decide that you hate what you’ve
created.
Click the Reset button, and GarageBand, polite little program that it is, asks
whether you’re sure, as you see in Figure 3-5.
Clicking the Yes button blows away any customizations that you’ve made and
resets the Loop Browser button layout to its default — the way that it looked
the first time you launched GarageBand.
Blowing away these customizations isn’t a big deal; you don’t lose sounds or
settings. Only the names and positions of the keywords in the Loop Browser
are changed.
The Audio/MIDI Pane
Most Macs have audio input and output ports, and many Macs have built-in
microphones and speakers in addition to their ports. If you have a FireWire,
USB, or PCI card audio interface, this interface has an audio-in and an audio-
out port — or more likely, ports.
The Audio/MIDI pane is where you select the input and output that you want
GarageBand to use. It’s also where you optimize GarageBand’s performance.
Last but not least, this pane tells you how many MIDI devices GarageBand
recognizes at the moment.
Figure 3-5:
Are you

59
Chapter 3: GarageBand Preferences: How Do You Like Yours?

To open this pane, choose GarageBand➪Preferences (or press Ô-,) and click
Audio/MIDI at the top of the Preferences window. The following sections
explain your options.
Audio ins and outs
The first items in this pane are the Audio Output and Audio Input menus. If
your Mac has more than one audio input (for example, the built-in audio-in
port plus a FireWire or USB audio interface) or output (for example, the built-
in headphone port or a FireWire or USB audio interface), this is how you tell
GarageBand which input or output to use.
Refer back to Figure 3-1. You see that two inputs (recording) and two outputs
(playback) are available. These options reflect the built-in audio-in and audio-
out ports on my Mac, plus the two additional ports on my Digidesign Mbox
audio interface. (See Chapter 2 for details about ports and audio interfaces.)
You can only see the Input menu in Figure 3-1, but the Output menu offers the
same two choices.
That’s it. If you only see one input and output choice in either menu on your
Mac, wave bye-bye to them. You won’t have to use them much until you add
a new audio device to your setup, and you can ignore the upcoming warning.
If you see two or more input or output choices in either menu on your Mac,
read the upcoming warning carefully.
If you see two or more choices in either menu and you like to plug and
unplug your audio devices with reckless abandon (like yours truly), you
should read this warning even more carefully, because it’s even more likely
to apply to you.
When you don’t hear what you expect to hear, or the sound is not coming
from the speakers or headphones that you expected to hear it from, don’t
panic. GarageBand (version 1.0.1) has a maddening tendency to change these
inputs and outputs for no apparent reason and without your express permis-
sion, written or otherwise. So, if the music stops when you least expect it,
look at these two menus first.
Here’s another tidbit: When you choose a new input or output, GarageBand,
always the model of politeness, asks whether you’re sure and informs you
that the change might take a minute, as you see in Figure 3-6.
60
Part I: Starting on a Good Note 

Optimizing your buffers
Next on the Audio/MIDI pane are the Optimize For radio buttons. Here’s the
scoop on your options:
 Maximum Number of Simultaneous Tracks (Large Buffer Size): If you
see GarageBand error messages about the number of tracks, amount of
RAM, processor speed, or anything else that is affecting your ability to
record or play a song with the small buffer setting in effect, try selecting
this radio button.
The large buffer lets GarageBand play more tracks at once — as it says —
but there’s an insidious price to pay. This price is known as latency in the
audio vernacular; this is the delay between the time a sound is made (by
singing or playing) and the time that sound is heard. The delay is longer
if you have a large buffer. The higher the latency, the harder it is to play
and sing in time with other tracks. Latency sucks. Even though latency is
measured in milliseconds, it still hurts your ability to do good work.
Things are different when you’re doing postproduction work — adding
effects, setting levels, and so on — or when you’re just listening to a
track without recording anything. If this is the case, selecting the
Maximum Number of Simultaneous Tracks (Large Buffer Size) radio
button may improve GarageBand’s performance.
 Minimum Delay When Playing Instruments Live (Small Buffer Size): If
your Mac has enough horsepower and RAM to run GarageBand decently,
select this radio button. It should be the right setting for you most of the
time. It’s the setting to use to avoid as much latency as possible. (Most
higher-quality audio gear has extremely low (or zero) latency. That’s
part of the reason why it costs more.)
Figure 3-6:
This may
take a
minute —
or two.
61
Chapter 3: GarageBand Preferences: How Do You Like Yours?

My advice: Use the large buffer only when the small buffer setting makes
GarageBand complain. If you have a fast G4 or any G5 and lots of RAM (fast
hard drives don’t hurt, either), you may never need to use the large buffer
setting, even with songs that have 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, or more tracks.
Were you humming Snoopy vs. the Red Baron after reading 10, 20, 30, 40, 50,
or more in the previous sentence? I was listening to the song. Don’t know what
I’m talking about? Get a hold of the 1966 hit by Florida’s first (and probably
only) faux-Brit pop/rock novelty act, The Royal Guardsmen, and you will.
GarageBand’s performance, and the myriad things that you can do to improve
it, is a recurring theme of this book. You hear lots more on the subject in many
other chapters. So if changing buffer settings doesn’t do the trick for you,
something that you find in another chapter may.
Knowing your MIDI status
The last item in the Audio/MIDI pane is the MIDI Status item, which reports
how many MIDI devices GarageBand believes are connected to your Mac at the
moment. So, MIDI Status isn’t a preference. It just displays a bit of information.
Back in Figure 3-1, the upper-right window shows my PowerBook, which has
no MIDI devices connected to it. As you can see, MIDI Status detected 0 MIDI
devices.
Now look at Figure 3-6. This is my other Mac, the G5, which has one MIDI
device connected. As you can see, MIDI Status detected this device.
Now wave bye-bye to this feature. You probably won’t need to look at it again.
Not only is GarageBand smart enough to count the MIDI devices for you, but
it’s also polite enough to let you know each time that number changes, as you
can see in Figure 3-7.

The Export Pane
This pane is used to set your desired playlist, composer, and album name
when you export a finished song into iTunes. As usual, you get to the pane
by choosing GarageBand➪Preferences (or by pressing Ô-,) and clicking the
Export button in the navigation bar at the top of the window. When you’re
ready to export a song, GarageBand uses the information in the three text
fields, as shown in Figure 3-8: iTunes Playlist, Composer Name, and Album
Name.
So when I export a finished song by choosing File➪Export to iTunes, as
shown in Figure 3-9, the song arrives in iTunes with the information that 
I typed into the Export pane already entered for me in iTunes, as shown in
Figure 3-10.

Chapter 3: GarageBand Preferences: How Do You Like Yours?

Notice that iTunes picked up the composer and album names that I typed
into GarageBand’s Export pane. That’s nice, but what’s nicer is that iTunes
also picked up the title of the song — something I never typed into
GarageBand or iTunes!
The Advanced Pane
The Advanced pane doesn’t contain anything advanced. My guess is that
Apple is trying to keep you from changing these settings unless someone else
tells you to.
You find three pop-up menus here: Maximum Number of Real Instrument
Tracks, Maximum Number of Software Instrument Tracks, and Number of
Voices per Instrument, as shown in Figure 3-11. The idea is that you can
adjust these settings and affect GarageBand’s performance.
My advice is to set all three menus to Automatic and forget about it. Just
leave ’em alone unless GarageBand begins spewing error messages at you.
If you are having performance problems, and changing the Optimize For set-
ting (in the Audio/MIDI pane) doesn’t help, you can try making changes in
these menus next. Choose the lowest (or second-lowest) setting in each one
for the first change that you make.

T
here’s no getting around it: Making a song with GarageBand uses pretty
much the same process that musicians and producers use to make hit
records in multimillion-dollar recording studios. GarageBand makes it easier
and a lot less expensive, but the process is much like the process that the
pros use.
And so, to use GarageBand well, you need to understand the multitrack
recording process that lies beneath it all. Once you understand multitrack
recording, you can plan and produce better recordings with GarageBand. If
you’re ignorant of the process, you’re likely to flail about hopelessly, without
ever composing anything good enough to listen to more than once. It’s that
simple.
Even if you’re a grizzled old studio vet who has been overdubbing and sweet-
ening tracks since I was in diapers (unlikely), you may want to read the chap-
ter anyway. You may think you know the multitrack recording process, and
you probably do, but I guarantee that you don’t know GarageBand like I do.
Have you ever been inside a multimillion-dollar recording studio or mixed
audio on a 48-channel console? Have you recorded songs on a 24-track tape
machine that costs more than my house? Or, have you produced demo record-
ings for several rock bands? Perhaps you’ve mixed audio for television and

radio commercials. Well, I’ve done all that and more before I gave up the adver-
tising and audio games and became a full-time Mac geek after getting my first
Mac back in 1985.
But I digress.
Here, I try to kill two birds with one chapter. So, in this little chapter, you
stroll through the process of multitrack recording, and I show you how the
process works with GarageBand.
This chapter is a road map at 20,000 feet. As such, it may foreshadow the
techniques, terms, features, and other things that I cover in more detail in
Parts II and III. If a GarageBand feature or term isn’t explained fully in this
chapter, rest assured that I explain it in full and loving detail elsewhere in
this book.
Understanding the Role of Stereo
in Multitrack Recording
The way I see it, listening to music has had three major paradigm shifts over
the ages:
 The Prerecorded Music Age: I won’t even attempt to put dates on it,
but this was the time before recording audio was invented.
 The Age of Monaural Music: During this period, audio was recorded
onto many types of media, using all kinds of strange devices (wire
recorders, rotating drum recorders, and tape recorders, to name a few).
During the Monaural Age, though, everything that was recorded had
something in common: It would play out of a single speaker. Or, to be a
bit more technically correct, even if multiple speakers played back the
sound, what you were hearing was a single track (or “channel”) of audio.
This era could have easily been known as The Age of One-Channel, but
for reasons that will become apparent in just one second (or one sen-
tence, whichever comes first), the monaural metaphor works better
here.
 The Age of Stereo: One day, probably before I was born (my tech editor
says it was 1933), the recording industry noticed that audio sounded
dramatically better when it came out of two speakers, with each speaker
playing a discrete track (or channel) of music.
Stereo caught on by the late 1950s and, although popular songs contin-
ued to be released as monaural recordings well into the 1960s, stereo
has been the way we listen to music ever since.
68
Part I: Starting on a Good Note 

Although the way we listen to music — stereo playback — has not changed
much in over 50 years, the way that we record that music has changed dra-
matically many times. Paradigm shifts happen, and in the world of audio
recording, they have happened quite frequently. We made the leap from
69
Chapter 4: Introducing Multitrack Recording with GarageBand
Stereo versus mono (versus
quadraphonic versus 5.1)
In the simplest terms, stereo sounds great
because you have two ears and it plays two
tracks of music from two speakers. Perhaps
you’ve noticed that correlation — or not — but
that’s why stereo sounds better than mono. With
stereo sound, your ears receive sound waves
from any source at different times. Each ear
hears overtones, echoes, harmonics, and every-
thing else about that sound at different times.
Stereo recordings create the illusion that a
stage exists between your speakers, with the
music coming from the stage (well, a sonic illu-
sion, if not a visual one). When you listen to a
well-produced stereo recording on a good sound
system, some instruments sound as if they’re in
the very back of the stage, all the way over on
the left side, while others sound like they’re just
right of center in the front row, playing loudly.
As a producer of stereo recordings, you can
create this illusion, too. When you mix and
master a multitrack recording, you can assign
each instrument or voice a position on the
sound stage (sometimes called the sound field.)
In recording lingo, you assign the amount of
each track that you want to hear coming out of
each speaker with a control known as pan (for
panorama). In most systems, pan is controlled
with a knob, and GarageBand is no exception.
Turn the Pan knob to the left, and you hear more
of the track on the left. You get a similar effect
by turning the Pan knob to the right.
As far as making one instrument or vocal sound
more “up-front” than others, this is mostly done
by adjusting the track’s level, which is how loud
that track is in relation to other tracks. You can
use other tricks to emphasize a single track over
others, but level is the one that you’ll probably
use the most.
By the way, many people now have fabulous 5.1
audio systems (also known as surround sound)
and awesome home theater setups. But guess
what? Although more music becomes available
in the 5.1 format every day, 50 years after its intro-
duction, stereo is the way most music is heard
and I don’t see that changing anytime soon.
“Quadraphonic” sound — four channels of
audio played through four speakers — was
introduced in the late 1970s but never caught
on. I used to think “quad” failed because humans
don’t have four ears. My 5.1 system shoots that
theory all to heck.
My tech editor, Bryan, informs me that Quadra-
phonic sound was actually introduced in the
1970s and first demonstrated in the late 1960s.
The Who’s Quadrophenia, released in 1973, was
one of the first pop albums released in the quad-
raphonic format and songwriter/guitarist Pete
Townshend and associate producer/engineer
Glyn Johns spent many hours recording ambient
sound effects for the album — waves crashing,
rain falling, and such — because there were few
quadraphonic recordings of that sort available.
For what it’s worth, Pink Floyd’s The Dark Side
of the Moon, an album that spent the better part
of my life on the Billboard Hot 100, was also
released in quadraphonic form. It still didn’t
catch on.

monaural to 2-track; 2-track to 4-track recording (tape); from 4-track to 8-track
recording (still tape); from 1⁄4-inch tape to 1-inch tape to 2-inch tape (still tape);
from tape to disk (no longer tape); and from million-dollar studios to hundred-
dollar, pocket-sized recorders to inexpensive software like GarageBand.
If you have the chops, you can create music with GarageBand that sounds
as good as (or better than) music that was made in million-dollar studios
30 years ago. But regardless of how many tracks, channels, machines, tape
decks, instruments, outboard gear, or microphones that you have, your songs
always end up mixed down to just two tracks (also known as two “channels,”
or “stereo mix”). Figure 4-1 is worth at least a thousand words.
In Figure 4-1, the four tracks at the top represent three instrument tracks and
a vocal track that will be mixed together to create the final two-track master.
The two tracks at the bottom (L and R for left and right) represent the final
mixed and mastered product — a two-track (stereo) mix.
So now you know what that song in your head will look like after you record all
the parts using GarageBand. To record the song to that point, you use the multi-
track recording process, which is what the rest of this chapter is all about.

Part I: Starting on a Good Note 

1. Get all the tracks down on tape (or disk in the case of GarageBand).
In studio-speak, this is called getting the tracks in the can.
Be careful here; studio-speak can be confusing. The can isn’t a set of
headphones, as I mentioned previously. Used in this context, “in the
can” means that all the tracks that you need for this song are done. In
this instance, the can is a metal or plastic container that is used to store
tape (or film). The plural form (cans) still means headphones. I told you
studio-speak can be confusing.
Tracks are the basic building blocks of multitrack recording. You record
tracks, enhance tracks, mix tracks, put tracks in the can, and so on.
2. Once your tracks are in the can, your next step is called mixing or
postproduction.
This is the time to adjust each track’s settings — level, pan, equalization,
echo, reverb, effects, and so on — so that everything sounds just right
to you.
3. Finally, when every track is adjusted and the song sounds exactly the
way you want it to, you can add effects to the song as a whole (a little
echo or reverb usually sounds cool) and add a fade-in, a fade-out, or
both.
You then export your final mix as a two-channel (stereo) audio file. This
final step is called mastering.
I discuss tracks, mixing, and mastering in GarageBand in just a moment, but
first, I want to be sure that you’re ready to rock and roll.
Cutting the Tracks (“No blood on ’em,
Mr. Dylan”)
As you may remember from a page or two ago, the track is the basic building
block of a song; each song is made up of one or more tracks.
The maximum number of tracks is a function of the speed of your Mac’s
processor, the amount of RAM it has, and the speed of your hard drive(s).
You can have only a handful of tracks on older G3 and G4 models to heaven-
only-knows-how-many tracks on the latest, greatest G5s.
This section explains how to begin the multitrack recording process by laying
down tracks in GarageBand. I explain how to record and how you use a few of
GarageBand’s features to make sure that each track sounds good later, when
you mix those tracks into song.
71
Chapter 4: Introducing Multitrack Recording with GarageBand

In GarageBand, you can only record one track at a time. When you begin
laying tracks, this means that, although you can record everyone in your
band playing a song together — or you can sing and play the piano at the
same time — if you do, you can’t adjust only the drums or only the vocals
later in the mixing stage. If you want to adjust, say, the guitar or the vocals
separately from the rest of the song, you have to record each part individu-
ally on a separate track.
To record a track, follow these steps:
1. Open GarageBand, and create a new song.
You can create a new song in one of two ways:
• If this is the first time you’ve launched GarageBand or no song
was open when you quit GarageBand, you see the dialog box that’s
shown in Figure 4-2. Click the Create New Song button, and that’s
what will happen — a new song window appears.
• If a song opened when you launched GarageBand, you can create a
new song by choosing File➪New.
2. When you see the standard OS X Save As dialog box appear, as shown
in Figure 4-3, give your song a name and tell GarageBand where to
save the file. You can also set some basic settings for the song.
The settings that are shown in Figure 4-3 are the default and the most
common settings for a song. Of course, you can change these settings
for any song using the menus and slider, as follows:
• Tempo: Use this slider to adjust the tempo. 
• Time: The pop-up menu lets you adjust the time signature. The
adjacent bpm box indicates the beats per minute as selected with
the Tempo slider. (If you type a new number in the box, the Tempo
slider will move by the appropriate amount.)
• Key: Use this pop-up menu to adjust the key.
Figure 4-2:
You’ll see
this prompt
the first time
you launch

(and rarely

72
Part I: Starting on a Good Note 

It’s probably a good idea to leave the Tempo, Time, and Key settings
alone if you don’t know what they mean, at least for now. You can always
change them later if you like. 
After you save the file, you see the timeline, where your new song is just
waiting for you to put something on its tracks.

Chapter 4: Introducing Multitrack Recording with GarageBand
Loops and tracks
You may be wondering where loops fit in to
the scheme of things (that thing being tracks),
and that’s a darn good question. The darn good
answer is that loops are pre-made snippets of
music and sound that come with GarageBand.
You can use them to build a whole song or use
them in combination with your own singing and
playing. When you want to use a particular loop,
you drag it onto a track. 
Loops come in two flavors: Some are software
instrument loops, which you put on software
instrument tracks, and the others are real instru-
ment loops, which (of course) you put on real
instrument tracks.
You may have as many different loops on a track
as you like, but they all have to be the same
flavor. In other words, you can have an unlimited
number of software or real instrument loops, but
you can’t have both kinds on the same track.
Don’t worry if this isn’t making sense yet—it will
soon . . .
Loops can be combined with your perfor-
mances as long as the loop and performance
are both the same flavor — real instrument or
software instrument.
It’s no biggie, though; GarageBand watches out
for you behind the scenes. For example, you
can’t drag a loop onto the wrong kind of track —
(continued)

GarageBand doesn’t allow it. And here’s the best
one of all: When you drag a loop from the Loop
Browser onto the Timeline, GarageBand auto-
matically creates the right kind of track for it.
So there’s your answer: Loops are either real or
software. They can only be used on the appro-
priate kind of track, and that kind of track is cre-
ated automatically when you drag and drop a
loop from the Loop Browser to the Timeline. For
example, in the following figure, I dragged the
Rock Steady loop from the Loop Browser at
the bottom of the window into the Timeline.
When I did that, GarageBand created a software
instrument track because Rock Steady is a soft-
ware instrument loop.
You can tell which kind of loop you’re looking at
in the Loop Browser by its icon (a musical note
for software instruments or a sound wave for
real instruments). You can them apart in the
Timeline by the shapes they contain (dots and
dashes for software instruments and sound
waves for real instruments). And if this book
were printed in color, you would know instantly
that software instrument loops are greenish and
real instrument loops are bluish, on the Timeline
and in the Loop Browser.
3. Create a track by choosing Track➪New Track, by pressing Ô-W, or
by clicking the New Track button on-screen.
Whichever you choose, the New Track dialog box appears, as shown
in Figure 4-4.
4. Click the name of the type of track that you want to create (at the
top of the window): Real Instrument or Software Instrument.
GarageBand offers three different kinds of tracks: Real instrument
tracks, software instrument tracks, and one master track per song.
You can have as many real and software instrument tracks as your
hardware can handle, but each song has but a single master track.

Part I: Starting on a Good Note 
(continued)

When you’re laying down tracks, real and software instrument tracks are
the ones that you need to focus on. The master track comes into play in
the mastering stage.
Here’s how to choose the right type of track for the instrument that you
want to record:
• Real instrument tracks: If you connect an instrument — an electric
guitar, electronic piano, synthesizer, or any other electronic instru-
ment or a microphone — directly to your Mac when you record,
this device requires a real instrument track in GarageBand. Vocals
are also considered real instruments in GarageBand, so you record
them on real instrument tracks, as shown in Figure 4-3. There is one
exception — a MIDI keyboard.
• Software instrument tracks: If you connect a MIDI keyboard to
your Mac, you use a software instrument track. This is also the type
of track to use if you want to record a track using GarageBand’s
built-in software instruments.
After you select the type of track that you want to record, a set of related
options appears in the left. At this point, recording a real instrument track
becomes a little different from recording a software instrument track.
Chapter 6 contains more information on recording software instrument
tracks; Chapters 7 and 8 have the scoop on recording real instrument
tracks.
Nice touch: After you record a track, the “region” you just recorded appears
on that track in the timeline in its proper color—real instruments are blue,
and software instruments are green. The tracks even glow their proper color
when you select them. Loops and real audio regions in the timeline are also
colored this way. You’ll have it memorized in no time; blue tracks are real
instrument tracks, while green tracks are software instrument tracks.

Chapter 4: Introducing Multitrack Recording with GarageBand

Listening to tracks during recording
and playback
Creating a multitrack recording is an iterative process. You record a track;
when it’s done, you listen to it to make sure it’s okay before you move on.
When you’re certain that track sounds okay, you record another track and
listen to it. Then you might listen to both tracks together. And record another
track, and then listen to all three tracks together as well as in different
combinations. 
Later, during mixing and mastering, you can add an effect to a track or to
the entire song and then you listen again. Or you change an instrument
sound and then listen to the change. And so it goes — you record a bit,
you listen a bit, you adjust a little, you listen a little, you tweak this and
that, and you listen some more.
To play or record your project, you use GarageBand’s transport controls, which
move the playhead much like the controls you’d find on a tape recorder, audio
CD player, iPod, or DVD player. These controls can be seen in Figure 4-5.
With all that playing, recording, and listening, it would behoove you to memo-
rize the myriad ways you can move the playhead hither and yon:
 Click the Play button (or use the keyboard shortcut, the space bar) to
play or stop the song.
 Click and drag the playhead to a new position in the beat ruler.
 Click anywhere in the beat ruler to move the playhead to that point.
 Click the Go to Beginning button (or use the keyboard shortcut, the
Home key) to move the playhead to the start of the song.
 Click the Rewind button (or use the keyboard shortcut, the ←key)
to move the playhead backwards one measure at a time.
 Click the Forward button (or use the keyboard shortcut, the →key)
to move the playhead forward one measure at a time.
 Click the numbers in the time display and then drag up or down without
releasing the mouse button to move the playhead to that point in the
song. Or, double-click the time display, type in a new number, and then
press Return.
Choosing which tracks you hear
The Mute and Solo buttons are opposite sides of the same coin. You use them
to determine which tracks you hear (or don’t hear) during recording and play-
back. The Mute button mutes (that is, silences) the track; the Solo button
76
Part I: Starting on a Good Note 

mutes every track except one. So, for example, if you had four tracks num-
bered 1 through 4, but only wanted to hear tracks 1 and 3, you would either
mute tracks 2 and 4 or solo tracks 1 and 3. 
Having both the Mute and Solo options is very convenient as you begin to
have more and more tracks in your song. 
The buttons “light up” when enabled, as shown in Figure 4-9. In that figure,
the Mute button (which looks like a speaker) is enabled for the Grand Piano
track, the Solo button (which looks like headphones) is enabled for the Male
Basic track.

Mute and solo work during recording and playback to allow you to select
only the tracks that you want to hear. You may mute or solo as many or as
few tracks as you like (or none or all) during playback or recording.
Deciding a track’s fate: Scrap bin, editing room, or mix?
After you play back a track, you may notice that is has some flaws. If you
want to correct those flaws, you have a few options:
 Punch in and re-record over the mistake. See Chapter 9 for details on
editing and tweaking.
 Delete the region you just recorded and start over: This is what to do
if you want to re-record the whole part you just recorded. To delete the
region, just click it in the timeline and press Delete (Backspace on some
keyboards). Now move the playhead to the appropriate spot in the song
and re-record that part. 
 Delete the track entirely: If you decide the track just isn’t working and
probably never will, you can delete it by clicking on its name in the Tracks
column and pressing Ô-Delete (Ô-Backspace on some keyboards). 
Changing a track’s settings
You can change the settings of a track by double-clicking its name in the
Tracks column, or by selecting it (with the mouse or the arrow keys) and
then choosing Track➪Show Track Info (or press Ô-I ) to display the Track
Info dialog box, as shown in Figure 4-6.

78
Part I: Starting on a Good Note 

You can choose a completely different instrument or change any preset for
any effect you’ve applied to that track. In fact, the only limitation is that you
can’t change a real instrument track into a software instrument track, or vice
versa. Other than that little hiccup, you may change the instrument on any
track at any time.
Checking levels during recording
and playback
A simulated LED display shows the level of the track in real time as you play
or record, as shown in Figure 4-7. 
Level is audio-speak for the relative loudness of the track. 
So, when you play or record, the level display for each track tells you that
track’s record or playback level at that precise point in your song. The play-
head always shows what that point is on the Timeline. Wherever the play-
head is located, that’s where the song will resume playing or recording if
you’ve stopped or paused.
Figure 4-7 was captured during the playback of the Male Basic vocal track.
The playhead is near the 3-second point, which is a very quiet passage. As
you can see, the level display is unlit, and the sound wave for the Male Basic
track is flat at about the 3-second mark.
Now take a look at Figure 4-8, which was taken 2 seconds later when my voice
was much louder.

Chapter 4: Introducing Multitrack Recording with GarageBand

The red LEDs on the right end of the level display are your enemies. You want
to see as little of them as possible when you record a track. If you see too much
red, the track is too “hot,” and it sounds broken up and distorted when you
play it back. An old studio saying goes like this: “If you see much red, your
track is dead.” Believe it.
In Figure 4-8, the little red dot just to the right of the rightmost red LED is
called a peak hold indicator or clipping indicator. It lights up whenever your
track has gone “into the red,” and it stays lit until you turn it off by clicking it.
If you notice that this dot is lit after you record a track, you should listen to
the track very carefully. The track may have been spoiled if you recorded it
in the red — or hot — zone.
If a track is too hot when you’re rehearsing or recording, adjust its level so
you see little or no red, and then record (or re-record). The following section
provides further details on adjusting levels.
Adjusting levels
When you record, you mostly use the level faders to keep tracks from being
recorded too hot, which can ruin the take. Later, during mixing and master-
ing, you use the level faders to “mix” all your tracks so each instrument and
voice is heard clearly. 
There are two ways to adjust the level of a track, as follows:
 Adjust the level of the entire track with the Fader control. Fader is a
pro audio term for a sliding control. The fader is located in the Mixer
column (see Figure 4-9).
 Adjust only part of a track with the Rubber Band control. When you
want to make part of a track louder or softer than the rest (or adjust its
level in more sophisticated ways), you use a “rubber band” Track volume
Figure 4-8:
A loud

fully lit (and
red on the
right).

Part I: Starting on a Good Note 

control, which appears below the track when you click the triangular
Track Volume button. There is no pro-audio term for rubber band con-
trols; they’re strictly a computer innovation. If you’ve used iTunes or
Final Cut Pro, you know how to use rubber band controls already; if not,
I’ll show you a little later in this section.
But I’ll start with the faders, which you click on and slide to the left to lower
the level and slide to the right to raise it. In Figure 4-9:
 The Grand Piano track is silent.
 The Male Basic track plays at a normal listening level.
 The Fingerstyle Bass track plays very loud and is horribly distorted.
So that’s about it for the Level Fader control, but you have a second way to
adjust the level of a track that’s often better, and here’s why: The fader only
lets you choose one level for the whole track. The way that I’m about to show
you lets you change the level anywhere you like — and as many times as you
like. For example, a track may start very quietly and build to normal levels (a
“fade in”), play at that level until a really loud passage occurs, drop the level
for the loud part, bring the level back to normal again, and then fade out.
To use the Track Volume rubber band control, follow these steps:
1. Click the triangular Show/Hide Track Volume button in the Tracks
column to make the rubber bands appear.
2. To change the level of a track at any point, click the rubber band and
drag the resulting bubble up or down on the rubber band to raise or
lower the level at that point in the song. 
Figure 4-10 shows a Track Volume rubber band.

81
Chapter 4: Introducing Multitrack Recording with GarageBand

Here’s a blow-by-blow description of what happens to the level for the Male
Basic track in Figure 4-10:
Time (Seconds)
Action
0
Silent
0–2
Increase the level from 0% to 75% (fade in)
2–4.5
Remain at the 75% level
4.5–7.5
Decrease the level from 75% to 50%
7.5–9.5
Increase the level from 50% to 75%
9.5–11
Decrease the level from 75% to 0% (fade out)
The rubber band method gives you more precise control than using the fader,
so you’ll probably use the former on most of your tracks during mixing and
mastering.
I recommend against using the Track Volume controller when recording.
It can be done, but it’s tricky and more likely to hurt your efforts and waste
your time. I highly recommend using the level faders when you record
(instead of the Track Volume controller) and only use Track Volume con-
trollers when you mix. I discuss mixing in great detail in Chapter 10. 
Polishing tracks
So you now know enough to lay down some tracks. After you’ve got most or all
your tracks in the can, you can polish and embellish your song. You may want
to redo a vocal part that isn’t as good as it could be, add the gentle strains of
a string ensemble in your choruses, or insert some handclaps or the sound of
Rubber band

a tambourine. You can trim noise at the beginning or end of a track, or cut
out mistakes and delete them, and more, all of which comes under the head-
ing of “editing” your tracks and is covered in Chapter 9.
One of the greatest things about multitrack recording is that it’s not over
until you say it’s over. If you ever decide that something doesn’t sound right,
even months after mixing and mastering the song, you can go back to your
original GarageBand file and change it to your heart’s content, then remix
and remaster, and you’re off to the races with a new version of your song.
Two things that you can do to polish your songs are overdubbing (redoing)
any part of a track that isn’t as good as it could be and sweetening, which is
adding new tracks to fill out the sound of your song. I describe these terms
briefly in the following sections and in more detail in Chapter 9.
Overdubbing
Overdubbing is re-recording a part of a track to fix mistakes that were made
in its performance or recording. 
In the old days, you couldn’t overdub unless you had fairly sophisticated
high-end tape machines that let you “punch in and punch out.” You would
listen to playback, and right before the bad part of the track, the engineer
would “punch” the Record button. As soon as you finished singing or playing
the replacement part, he would punch the Record button again. What came
before and after the replacement part remained intact, but the replacement
track was grafted into the middle like magic.
Overdubbing doesn’t sound convincing if the replacement part sounds much
different from the original part, so try to use the same setup that you used
when you recorded the original track — the same microphones, room, instru-
ment, audio interface, level and other settings, and so on — when you record
overdubs on that track.
83
Chapter 4: Introducing Multitrack Recording with GarageBand
Multiple takes versus overdubs
You can reduce your need to overdub by record-
ing multiple “takes” of a part. When you finish
recording a take and you’re relatively happy
with it, create a new track just like it and then
mute the original track. Record the part again
on the new track. If you like the new track, repeat
the process; if you don’t, use the Undo feature
and try again.
When you have three or four good takes in the
can, you can usually pick and choose pieces
from them and use them in place of overdubs to
create one superb take. This way, you don’t have
to worry about whether the overdub matches
the sound of the original. Because the takes
were recorded at the same time on the same
setup, they should naturally sound the same.

One last thing: If you flub an overdub take (or any take, for that matter),
GarageBand is very forgiving. Just undo the flubbed take by choosing
Edit➪Undo (or pressing Ô-Z), and try again.
GarageBand makes overdubbing and punching in and out easier than it’s ever
been. I show you how in detail in Chapter 9.
Sweetening
Another way that you can make your song sound more professional and “fin-
ished” is to add tracks after your primary recording is done. Sometimes, you
listen to a semifinished mix and realize that what this song really needs is one
or more embellishments, such as
 Handclaps
 Bells
 Whistles
 Violins and cellos (also known as a string pad)
 Tambourines
 Or some other embellishment
You can sweeten a song anytime you want. If you’ve already mastered it, go
back to the GarageBand file that you mastered from, add the new track or
tracks, and remaster the song. Sweetening is also covered in detail in Chapter 9.
Mix That Sucka
When you think you’re done recording tracks, overdubbing, and sweetening,
you’re ready to start mixing. When you mix a song, you’re actually doing two
things:
 Adjusting the level for each track until all the tracks blend beautifully
together, with none too loud and none too soft
 Setting the pan position for each track to place it on the sound stage —
left, center, or right
Here’s an overview of how I work through the mixing process:
1. I usually start mixing by using the Fader Level controls until the rela-
tive level of each track is close to what I want to hear.
This is a very rough mix, but it is fast and easy to get this far this way.
84
Part I: Starting on a Good Note 

2. I use the Track Volume controls on tracks where I need better control
over their level throughout the song.
3. After I get the individual track levels set to my liking, I adjust the pan
location of each track.
4. Finally, I turn on and adjust effects (if necessary) for each track and
then check all my levels and pans again. 
Once I’ve done all that, I’m ready to move on to the final step, Mastering.
Figure 4-11 shows a song that’s mixed and ready to be mastered.
Setting the pan
For every thing — turn, turn, turn — there is a season — turn, turn, turn.
And for every track, there is a Pan knob — turn, turn, turn. Turn the knob
to the left to make more of that track come out of the left speaker; turn it
to the right to do the reverse. Figure 4-12 shows a track (Drum Kit) with its
pan set to dead center (top), hard left (middle), and hard right (bottom).
In the top version, the track is panned dead center, and you can hear equal
parts of it from the left and right speakers. In the middle version, the track
is panned all the way to the left so that all the sound comes from the left
speaker. And, of course, the bottom version shows the track panned all
the way to the right.
Figure 4-11:
This song is

85
Chapter 4: Introducing Multitrack Recording with GarageBand

Notice that the middle and bottom versions have only one of their two rows
of LED level-display lights lit, but the top version has both rows lit. That’s
because the level displays are showing you the stereo output for the track.
The top row of simulated LEDs is the level of the left channel; the bottom
row shows the level for the right channel.
So, to make a track sound like it’s coming from slightly to the left of center,
you would turn the Pan control slightly to the left of center. And so on.

(Lord and) Mastering
Once you’re satisfied with your mix, heave a big sigh of relief — the end is
near. All that’s left is to master that puppy and be done with it.
Mastering is setting the song’s level. This is mostly used to fade in and fade
out, but mastering is also useful for emphasizing a quieter passage. You can
also apply a master sound to the whole song.
All it takes is a few clicks. . .
. . . which makes it nothing like mastering a stereo recording in the real world.
The art of changing a two-track mix into a fantastic-sounding Red Book Audio
CD (e.g. the type of CD you buy at a music store) is just that — an art. Only a
few hundred truly great mastering engineers exist in the world today, each an
artist who can take a decent-sounding stereo mix and master it so that it
sounds absolutely brilliant when you play the CD.
Mastering your song with GarageBand couldn’t be easier. Here’s an overview
of steps:
1. Enable (show) the Master Track by choosing Track➪Show/Hide Master
Track or pressing Ô-B. 
Like the Metronome and Grid, the Master Track is a toggle. If the Master
Track is showing, the Ô-B command hides it; if it’s hidden, this com-
mand shows it. So, if you don’t see a Master Track at the bottom of your
Timeline, press Ô-B now.
2. You may have to scroll down to see the Master Track; it always
appears as the last item on the track list, as shown in Figure 4-13.
3. Double-click the words Master Volume (or choose Tracks➪Show Track
Info or use the shortcut Ô-I ) and choose a mastering preset. 
4. Click the Master Volume checkbox to reveal the Master Track’s rubber
band controller and adjust the song’s level that way if you like.
The Master Volume rubber band is the easiest way to create the fade-in
or fade-out effect at the beginning or end of your song.
In Figure 4-13, I’ve set up the master volume rubber band to fade in
quickly at the beginning of the song and fade out slowly at the end. I’ve
also got the first part of the bridge vocal a little louder than the rest of
the song, because it had some quiet, delicate guitar work. (Yeah, sure.)
87
Chapter 4: Introducing Multitrack Recording with GarageBand

5. To apply a preset sound to the Master Track, either double-click it in
the Tracks column (it shows Master Volume in Figure 4-13) or select
the track with a single-click and choose Track➪Show/Hide Track Info
(or press Ô-I ). 
Whichever method you choose, you should see a Track Info window just
like the ones that you used for Software Instrument and Real Instrument
Tracks, as shown in Figure 4-14. In the Track Info window for the Master
Track, the left column contains categories and the right column contains
presets in that category.
6. Try a few presets and see if you like them — or maybe you did such
a superb job mixing the song that it doesn’t need any master effects
applied.

Part I: Starting on a Good Note 

7. In any event, when you’re satisfied with the sound that you’re hear-
ing, choose File➪Export to iTunes. 
In a few moments, you can switch to iTunes and listen to your
masterpiece.
And that’s that. You’ve laid down the tracks and produced, mixed, and
mastered your song.
At this point, the song may not really be done. If you want to get the best pos-
sible song, you still have a bit more work ahead of you:
1. Listen critically to the song in iTunes while you burn it on an audio CD.
Play the CD on your favorite audio systems: in your car, your portable
CD player with headphones, and your boom box. You may even want to
play the CD on your Mac (which will sound slightly different than when
you play it from the hard drive using iTunes).
2. Throughout the process, take notes on what you hear and what you
don’t hear — and what you think you would like to hear.
3. Remix and remaster according to your notes.
4. Repeat the process until you’re totally satisfied with the song.
Now, it’s really done.
For details on tweaking the Master Volume, applying presets, and more, see
Chapter 11, which covers mastering in more detail.
Managing Song Files
Don’t trash your GarageBand files after you master a song. You may want to
remix, sweeten, and remaster the song, and you can’t do it if the GarageBand
file isn’t available.
When and if you remix or remaster a song, add a number or descriptive word
or two to the new version. If you added some tambourine and handclaps to
a song named “Bliss,” name the revised version something like “Bliss2” or
“BlissT&C.” Then, you at least have a chance of finding the version that you
want a few months from now.
When a song is absolutely perfect, you can add something like GoldenMaster
(for example, “BlissGoldenMaster”).
Note: I have never finished a song that was even close to being absolutely
perfect, but I’ll probably add GoldenMaster to its name if I do.

Part I: Starting on a Good Note 
Why and when to consider Save As
rather than Save
One last thing: If your song is good, or even if
you think it may be pretty good, it behooves you
to save early and save often while you work on
it. I save every few minutes. If I get out of the
chair while a project is open, I save the file
before I walk away from my desk.
And if your song is really, really good — or really,
really important — consider using the Save As
command to create backup copies, too.
I prefer to use Save As (choose File➪Save As
or press Ô-Shift-S) to save songs on a differ-
ent hard drive than the original. But even if you
don’t have an extra hard drive, using the Save
As command to create a backup copy of your
song file may be the most important thing you
do all day.
If you have only one copy of a song file, it can
be lost in a heartbeat. If you use the Save As
command to create a backup copy, however,
you’ll have a copy that’s frozen at that moment
in time. You can always use the backup if some-
thing awful happens to the original. The more
important the song, the more often you should
stash away a backup copy of it.
Warning: After you perform a Save As com-
mand, the version of the song on your screen is
the new one that you just saved (as). You may
(or may not) want to close it and reopen your
original song file. You should know which file
you’re actually working on and where that file
resides (so that you can reopen it and work on
it again after you quit GarageBand).
I put my backups on a separate FireWire hard
drive, appending time and date information to
each new version. If the original song file is
called rebel, its backup copies would be named
rebel030604-5p, rebel030904-2a, and so on.
Tip: Adding the date and time is completely
superfluous these days, but because I’ve done
it that way for years, it has become a habit. So
even though Mac OS X makes this practice
unnecessary by letting you sort files in an Open
dialog box by their modification date, I still find
myself doing it my way.
List View
Column View

91
Chapter 4: Introducing Multitrack Recording with GarageBand
If you don’t see a Date Modified column in
your Open dialog box, click the List View button.
Click the words Date Modified in the column
header to sort by modification date; click the
words Date Modified again to reverse the sort
order (that is, to sort from A to Z or from Z to A).
Neat!
Trust me: This can be a lifesaver if you totally
screw up a song, if you delete tracks that you
didn’t mean to delete (and didn’t undo), if your
Mac and/or hard drive are damaged, or if the
file becomes corrupted. Many fates can befall
a song file, and most of them have unpleasant
consequences if you don’t have a backup.

Laying Down
Tracks

In this part . . .
B
ecause you don’t need to have a single shred of musi-
cal talent to create a song using Apple Loops, I discuss
loops first in Chapter 5. With that groundwork laid, I move
along to explore the wild world of MIDI in Chapter 6, which
delves into the art and science of laying down tracks using
GarageBand’s built-in software instruments. Then, it’s on to
the big time — recording vocals and acoustic instruments
with microphones in Chapter 7, and recording guitars and
electronic instruments in Chapter 8. By the time you’ve
finished reading Part II, you’ll know everything you need
to know about tracks and how to use them.

ven if you can’t play or sing a note, you can have lots of fun using
GarageBand’s loops, which are prerecorded bits of music that require
absolutely no talent on your part to sound great. In many cases, the fastest
and easiest way to get a song started is to use one of the more than one thou-
sand different loops that come with GarageBand.
What Is a Loop, Anyway?
A loop, in its simplest form, is a piece of music that can repeat (loop) seam-
lessly. Loops are designed this way; a good one can be repeated without
missing a beat. When you repeat a loop, it’s called looping. To use a loop you
drag it onto a track (or onto the timeline, where a track is created for it auto-
matically). But I’m getting ahead of myself.
Anyway, the thousand-plus little pieces of sound that came with GarageBand
are called loops. If you repeat a loop seamlessly, the loop is looped. The act of
doing so is called looping.
In effect, the term loop, which indicates a repeating segment of music,
stemmed from the fact that the first artists doing this (Eno and Fripp come
to mind) would actually cut the magnetic recording tape and paste it back
together in a loop that played continuously. It required multiple tape players
and had to be awkward, but that’s how looping got its start.

GarageBand has two kinds of loops: software instrument and real instrument
loops, as follows:
 Software instrument loops: These are recorded using a MIDI keyboard
or drum machine. Most of the loops that come with GarageBand are soft-
ware instrument loops.
 Real instrument loops: These are recorded from an analog source (that
is, electric guitars, basses, horns, wind instruments, and, of course,
vocals). You don’t find as many of these in the Apple Loops.
Spicing Up Your Songs with Loops
Entire music genres — dance, electronica, house music, rap, and many other
kinds of music — have made an art form out of using loops. But don’t let
these genres limit your perception of how loops are used. In GarageBand,
loops don’t always have to be looped. In fact, many of GarageBand’s loops
sound better as a one-shot accent than they do when you loop (repeat) them
more than once. Here are just a few of the possibilities:
 Loops are often used as a background groove or as the central, dri-
ving theme of a song. You can use a drum loop to provide the backbeat
to your song or maybe just to keep the beat while you build other tracks
with loops, instruments, and vocals.
 Loops can also be used as musical punctuation marks. You can make a
horn part lurk in the chorus, or a funky guitar riff chug along in the verse.
For better or verse (groan), a loop can be the perfect tool for your song,
regardless of the sound that you seek (or you think you’re seeking).
 You can also use a loop to spice up a single chorus, bridge, or verse
and make it just a little bit different than the other ones. You can add a
shaker or other percussion loop in the last verse and find that that was
exactly what was missing in the song. Alternately, perhaps you need a
bridge to break up a song. With three or four loops, you can make a bass
line, drum fill, and horn riff that really punch up your song to the next
level.
Finding Loops for Your Songs
Many loops are samples of music that were created by other artists. Other
loops are entirely original work, including the loops that come with
GarageBand.
96
Part II: Laying Down Tracks 

A debate has long raged on the ethics of making something new by using
music samples (or loops) of another artist’s work. In any event, you are free
to use the loops that come with GarageBand any way you like, without fur-
ther obligation. However, if you sample and loop a signature guitar riff by the
Artist Formerly Known As Prince from his CD or tape, you run the risk of
owing that mighty Minnesotan big bucks if and when your song becomes a
smash-hit sensation. Here’s the moral of story: When in doubt, ask for the
artist’s permission.
You don’t have to confine yourself to the loops that Apple provided with
GarageBand. Here are some other sources to check out:
 Buy the GarageBand Jam Pack. This costs a hundred bucks and gives
you thousands of additional sounds, instruments, loops, effects, and
so on.
The Jam Pack is a bargain if you’re trying to make popular music. If
you’re trying to create other genres, particularly ones with orchestral
instrumentation, it’s not such a good deal, because it seems to be heavy
with rock, pop, hip-hop, and urban loops and instruments and light on
strings, horns, and other “classical” instruments. See Chapter 15 for
more about Jam Pack.
 Search for the free GarageBand-compatible loops on the Internet.
Within a few days of GarageBand’s release, lots of free loops began
showing up on the Net. Do a Google search for “GarageBand Free Loops”
(include the quotation marks), and you’ll find a ton of ’em.
The format for the loops that are used by GarageBand is known as Apple
Loops. Other programs, including Apple’s Soundtrack ($199), also use the
Apple Loop format. Apple Loops can be found in your Library/Application
Support/GarageBand folder and will have the .aiff file extension. They are
uncompressed audio files that carry additional information that makes them
work as Apple Loops.
If you want to create your own loops, you need the free Apple Loop SDK
(Software Development Kit), which you can download from Apple’s developer
Web site at: http://developer.apple.com/sdk/#AppleLoops.
The SDK includes a tool called Soundtrack Loop Utility, which is the program
used to create Apple Loop files. The kit also includes the guidelines for creat-
ing Apple Loops for use with GarageBand and Soundtrack.

Meet the Loop Browser
The Loop Browser is GarageBand’s tool for managing the thousand(s) of loops
in your loop library. The Loop Browser is where you find GarageBand’s built-in
loops, as well as any loops that you’ve picked up from other sources. You use
the Loop Browser to find, preview, and select loops from your collection and
then add them to tracks.
To take a look at this Loop Browser, you can make the browser appear at the
bottom of the main window in one of the following ways:
 Click the little eye icon that’s just below the tracks and Timeline zoom
control in the lower-left corner of the main window.
 Choose Control➪Show/Hide Loop Browser.
 Press Ô-L. And yes, this Show/Hide Loop Browser command is indeed
another one of those toggles.
Regardless of how you make the Loop Browser appear, when it does, the
lower portion of the GarageBand window transforms into the Loop Browser,
as shown in Figure 5-1.
Viewing loops in button or column view
The Loop Browser offers two convenient views — button or column — so
that you can always find the right loop without working too hard. These
views are as follows:
 Button view: This view gives you all the different categories that are
available, including your favorites, in the form of ovoid buttons (refer to
Figure 5-1). Click a button or several buttons, and the loops that match
the clicked buttons are displayed in a list on the right side of the Loop
Browser.
 Column view: If you’re not the button type, GarageBand also offers the
Column view. In Column view, you can browse your loops by genre,
instruments, moods, or your favorites. Select a category in the leftmost
column, and its contents appear in the column to its right, as shown in
Figure 5-2.
98

Chapter 5: It (Usually) Starts with a Loop

To toggle between the two views, click the icon in the lower-left corner of the
Loop Browser (refer to Figure 5-2).
When you open the loop browser in Button view, as shown in Figure 5-1, it
shows 30 buttons. If your display allows it, you can instead show up to 63
buttons if you follow these steps:
1. Open the Loop Browser.
2. Move the cursor to the spot where you see the little hand in Figure 5-3.
Your cursor turns into a grabber hand like mine when it’s over the right
spot.
3. When you see the grabber hand cursor, click and drag upward to see
more buttons in the Loop Browser or downward to see fewer.
Searching for a loop that you love
Finding a loop, of course, is the hard part, especially when you have thou-
sands to wade through. GarageBand has the two views to help you, however.
These views conveniently subdivide GarageBand loops into categories,
instruments, genres, and more, as you may have noticed in the previous fig-
ures. From instruments to genres to style, Apple has done the heavy lifting;
all you do is click buttons (or click the text in columns). GarageBand, marvel
that it is, does the rest, filtering out loops that won’t sound right in your
song, based on the key and tempo that you chose when you started the pro-
ject and your choices in the Loop Browser.
Click to switch between button and column view.

They say it’s not the size of the tool, but the skill of the craftsperson. The fol-
lowing sections help you use GarageBand’s tools to find just the right loop to
craft a song.
Searching in Button view
The following steps walk you through a loop search in Button view:
1. Start out with the Button view. If you’re not already in Button view,
click the Button View button in the lower-left corner of the Loop
Browser.
Drag upward to see more buttons.
Figure 5-3:
Click on the

101
Chapter 5: It (Usually) Starts with a Loop

2. Click one of the category buttons.
Figure 5-4 shows the 101 loops in the Beats category.
That’s cool but here’s something even cooler: In Figure 5-4, the Beats
button is highlighted. Some buttons have black text, and others have their
name in light gray. This is the beauty of the Button view; GarageBand elim-
inates choices that don’t fit your selection. (Look at the Organ button in
Figure 5-4 to see what I mean).
3. Now that GarageBand has narrowed things down to only loops that
can work in this context, click more buttons to narrow your search
further.
So, for example, clicking the Beats button alone yielded 101 loops.
Clicking the Urban button alone got me 86 loops. But clicking both the
Beats and Urban buttons narrowed the field to a more manageable nine
loops, as shown in the right column of Figure 5-5.
4. To further refine your choices, use the Scale pop-up menu in the
lower-left corner of the Loop Browser.
Here’s how the Scale menu options can further narrow your search:
• Any
• Minor
• Major
• Neither
• Good for Both

5. When you’ve narrowed your search enough to be manageable, listen
to some of the loops (see the section, “Previewing Loops,” later in the
chapter.
6. When you find the appropriate loop or loops, drag them onto the
timeline.
Searching in Column view
Moving on to the Loop Browser’s other view, the Column view is a lot like the
Finder’s Column view, so you should feel right at home with it. The following
steps explain how a search in Column view works:
1. Choose from By Genres, By Instruments, By Moods, or Favorites in the
leftmost column, and the appropriate choices become available in the
adjacent column to the right.
2. Choose from the choices that appear in the column to the right, and
more choices will become available in the adjacent column to the
right.
3. Choose one of the items in the third column, and the loops that match
that criteria appear in the rightmost column, as shown in Figure 5-6.
For example, in Figure 5-6, I chose By Genres➪Electronic➪Vinyl and found
nine different DJ vinyl record scratches.
If you purchase the GarageBand Jam Pack for $99, you get a couple of dozen
more.

Chapter 5: It (Usually) Starts with a Loop

Using the Search box
Another tool that you can use is the Search box. If you type a generic term
such as Blues in the search box at the bottom of the Loop Browser, you see a
list of every loop Apple that is designated as Blues-like. Note that you cannot
search for a loop by name using this method, even though it was the first
thing that I thought about.
I don’t use the Search tool; I found it to be unpredictable. The Button and
Column views work for me and have become my tool of choice for selecting
a loop.
Previewing loops
In the Loop Browser, after you find a loop that you think may fit the bill, you
want to hear it, of course. So click its name in the list on the far right. A speaker
icon appears before the loop’s name when you click on it to indicate that the
loop is currently playing. (Refer to Figure 5-6 to see the Speaker icon.) Now
click the Speaker icon again to stop playing the loop.
This method allows you to quickly hear a loop without having to drag it into
your song, listen to it, and delete it if you don’t like it.
Better still, use the up and down arrow keys to navigate the list, and you can
hear multiple loops in a row very quickly. You don’t even have to wait for one
loop to finish; just press the up or down arrow key and the next (or previous)
loop starts playing almost immediately. This is wonderful when one name
looks really good but has 43 available variations.

Part II: Laying Down Tracks 

Keeping your favorite loops at the ready
Most people who use loops will have particular loops that they really like, or
perhaps they will simply have loops that they want to be able to find quickly
while they are working on a song. GarageBand has a Favorites list built into
the Loop Browser, and it couldn’t be easier to use. Here’s how to use it:
 Adding a loop to your Favorites: When you find a loop that you like,
simply select the Fav check box at the far right of the Loop Browser.
This adds the loop to your Favorites list, which can be accessed through
either the Button view or the Column view in the Loop Browser.
If you don’t see a Fav column in the Loop Browser, either use the scroll
bar below the list of loops or click the green gumdrop at the upper-left
corner to fully expand the GarageBand window.
 Removing a loop from your Favorites list: This is simple, too. Just find
the loop and deselect the Fav check box.
The fastest way is probably to find the loop in your Favorites category,
but you can also find it any of the other ways you know (buttons,
columns, search box) to deselect its check box.
The Favorites list is particularly handy when you find a loop that you like a
lot, but the loop isn’t quite right for the current project. Adding it to your
Favorites list makes that loop easy to find when you’re working on that next
project where it will work perfectly.
Adding third-party loops 
to the Loop Browser
As I mention in the section, “Finding Loops for Your Songs,” earlier in this
chapter, you can find tons of free GarageBand loops on the Internet and in
third-party packages. The question is, how do you make those loops appear
in the Loop Browser?
The Jam Pack has its own installer, so you don’t have to worry about how to
install those loops. But because GarageBand offers no Import command, you
may be at a loss as to how you add Apple Loops to your loop library. Here
are the steps:
1. Drag the loop onto the Loop Browser.
2. Drop it there, as shown in Figure 5-7.
105
Chapter 5: It (Usually) Starts with a Loop

When you drop the loop onto the Loop Browser, it is automatically placed in
the appropriate location (the Library/Application Support/GarageBand
folder). If the loop is a properly made Apple Loop, it will be categorized auto-
matically; if it’s not, it won’t.
You can drag a folder or even a whole CD of loops onto the Loop Browser and
all of the loops in all subfolders will be added.
Setting a Loop’s Tempo
Each loop is created with its own tempo, which you can see in the Tempo
column of the Loop Browser. 
You can only see the Tempo, Key, Beats, and Favorites columns when the
GarageBand window is expanded. Click the green gumdrop on the left side
of the window’s title bar to fully expand the window, or click and drag the
lower-right corner of the window. Either way, when your window is about
1,000 pixels wide, the columns appear. To resize the columns, click and drag
the column divider.
GarageBand can automatically change the tempo of any loop that you add to
your song so that it matches the song’s tempo. Even more intuitively, when
you preview a loop in the Loop Browser, GarageBand plays the loop at the
tempo of your song. Those crazy folks at Apple think of (almost) everything!

106
Part II: Laying Down Tracks 

You can get an entirely different feel from a loop just by changing the tempo,
or rather, by using that loop at a different tempo than what you see in the
Tempo column. A slow, dirge-like drum loop may turn into something Latin-
tinged or jazzy when you double its tempo. Think of the default tempos in the
Tempo column as guidelines, and don’t be afraid to experiment! To change
the tempo, click and hold the tempo indicator, and a slider control pops up
under your cursor. Drag it upward to increase the tempo and downward to
decrease it.
Adding Loops to Tracks
I recommend laying down Software Instrument loops and tracks first, before
you begin recording Real Instrument tracks. If you decide the tempo is too
slow, or too fast, or the pitch is too high or low, you can change Software
Instrument tracks without rerecording them. But if you record Real Instrument
tracks first, and then decide a song is too slow, fast, high, or low, you’ll have to
rerecord all those Real Instrument tracks. 
You add a loop to your song by dragging it from the Loop Browser to the
Timeline. For example, Figure 5-8 shows the very tasty Blues Jazz Organ Riff 01
after I dragged it from the Loop Browser onto its own track on the Timeline.
Some loops are short and others are long, but most are 4, 8, or 16 beats in
length. Don’t worry much about length now, because as I explain the follow-
ing sections, loops can be extended, shortened, or repeated indefinitely.
Dragging and dropping loops
You can drag and drop a loop in a few different ways:
 Placing a loop on its own track: Drag the loop into any empty spot on
the Timeline, where a track of the appropriate type (real or software) is
created for the loop automatically.
 Inserting a loop onto an existing track: Drag the loop onto that track,
and GarageBand leaves it wherever you drop it on the track.
The track, of course, must be the same type as the loop. Use green loops
(software instruments) with green tracks and blue loops (real instru-
ments) with blue tracks.
 Moving a loop within or between tracks: Drag the loop to its new desti-
nation and release it.
107
Chapter 5: It (Usually) Starts with a Loop

There’s no correct or better way to add loops to your song. If you have a
track of the proper type created already, you may want to drag the loop onto
it to keep your track count down. If you’re just starting a song, you may want
each loop to create a new track. If the loop is being used as punctuation, you
may want to drag it onto existing audio and replace that audio with the loop.
It just depends what you’re doing and the effect you’re trying to achieve.
If something is on the track when you drop it, you will replace all or part of
that something.
Figure 5-9 shows what happens when you drop a loop onto a track that con-
tains recorded audio.
Figure 5-8:

108
Part II: Laying Down Tracks 

To put it another way, when I dragged a loop that was two measures long and
dropped it at about 7 on the beat ruler (which is that number line at the top
of the Timeline), two measures of my original recording (No Effects.6) disap-
peared, and the original region (No Effects.6) is split into two regions (No
Effects.7 and No Effects.8). The two measures of the loop Acoustic Noodling 04

(bottom).
109
Chapter 5: It (Usually) Starts with a Loop

have replaced my original recording for those two measures (from 7 to 9 on
the beat ruler).
You can drag as many loops onto one track as you like, but only one loop at a
time can play in any single track. If you want multiple loops to play at the
same time, you must put each loop on its own track.
Figure 5-10 shows a song that is composed entirely of loops.
If you’ve been following along at home, click the Play button or slap the
spacebar now to hear your song o’ loops.
Undoing and redoing a loop
If you drop a loop onto a track that has been recorded previously or has
other loops in it, the loop segment that you’re dragging replaces what you
drop it on. In other words, if you drag a loop that’s 4 beats long into the
middle of a screaming guitar solo that you finally nailed after 56 attempts, the
loop replaces 4 beats of your solo.
That’s why GarageBand has an Undo feature — choose Edit➪Undo or press
Ô-Z. I’m not sure how many Undoes GarageBand allows you to do, but it’s
more than a handful. And did you notice the Redo command? Choose
Edit➪Redo or press Ô-Shift-Z to redo something that you’ve undone. You can
Figure 5-10:

added.
110
Part II: Laying Down Tracks 

step forward or backward by repeating either command. This can be really
useful for listening to something the way it sounded before you did whatever
you just did, and the way it sounds after you did it.
As with any Mac program, however, Undo and Redo are linear, so pay atten-
tion lest you undo something you didn’t want to undo.
Extending, shortening, and repeating loops
Not every loop works perfectly as is. When you drag a loop into your song,
it’s short — a lot shorter than your song unless you write extremely short
songs. And, as you’ve heard several times, loops are designed to repeat (all
together now) seamlessly. So, the next thing you need to know is how to loop
a loop in a track. I start with that and then look at how you can make a loop
longer (or shorter) without affecting that seamlessness. I also explain how to
extend and shorten loops.
Before trying this exercise, it will be easier if you zoom in a little or a lot by
sliding the Zoom controller to the right. It’s harder to locate the correct area
to click in when you’re zoomed out (with the slider to the left).
Depending on where you click in a region, you see one of three cursors. When
the cursor is over the right edge of a loop region (either type — software or
real), it changes into one of two cursors, as follows:
 If you click in the top half of the right edge of a loop region, the loop
pointer cursor — a vertical line with a circular arrow — appears.
 If you click in the bottom half of the left or right edge of a loop region,
the resize pointer cursor — a vertical line with a straight arrow that
points away from the region — appears.
When you click any other part of the region, the cursor is a plain arrow, or
move, pointer. The move pointer is the one that you want when you’re
moving regions around within a track or moving them to other tracks.
All three pointers (also known as cursors) can be seen in Figure 5-11.
As you probably guessed, the loop pointer (the circled arrow) is the control
for repeating (looping) a loop; the resize pointer (the straight arrow) is used
for extending or shortening the length of a loop.
When you see the appropriate pointer, just click and drag. You’ll know that
you are repeating your loops if the outline of the track repeats and you see
notches in the region denoting the repetitions (refer to Figure 5-10).
If your region is smooth and notch-free, you are extending (or shortening)
your loop.

112
Part II: Laying Down Tracks 

Be careful when you extend, shorten, or repeat loops. Some loops can’t be
extended, but all loops can be shortened. Other loops can be extended but
may only include empty space when you extend them (like the Funky Pop
Bass 01 loop in Figure 5-11). It’s also easy to extend, shorten, or repeat your
loop to the wrong beat — or even slightly off beat. Use the guide marks in
the beat ruler and the Snap to Grid feature (toggle it on or off) to help you.
Finally, listen to the results before you do additional work on the project.
You can also edit loops in the same way you edit tracks. See Chapter 9 for
more on editing.
Changing instrument and preset settings
Last, but certainly not least, way back in Chapter 3, I told you that you should
never click the Save button after changing a preset without thinking about it
first. And I said that if you don’t change the filename before you click the
Save button, you risk replacing an awesome-sounding instrument or preset
that came with GarageBand with your own rendition, which may or may not
suck. I stressed the importance of not replacing any of the Apple-supplied
presets or instruments with your crude efforts, and promised that I would tell
you more in Chapter 5.
Well, here we are in Chapter 5, and you can see the more part of the story if
you select a loop in a trackand then choose Track➪Show Track Info or use
the shortcut Ô-I. This displays the Track Info window. Click details to expand
the Track Info window, and you see all the settings that come with a loop. You
can change presets for a loop here, and if you do, there’s an important button
that’ll keep you from replacing the original presets with your changes.
It’s the Make Preset command, and I urge you to use it whenever you create a
sound that you like. If you use this command, you’ll never make a fatal error
and click the wrong button when the Do You Want to Save the File before
Switching to a New One? alert box appears. After you click the Make Preset
button, you can simply save the loop with your changes under a different
name.
Editing Loops: A Preview
I explain some basic edits you can make to loops here. But you should also
know that you can get really creative with loops with techniques you use to
edit almost any track. For example, you can
 Split loops into different parts.
 Delete part of a loop.
113
Chapter 5: It (Usually) Starts with a Loop

 Move sections of a loop.
 Or rearrange the notes in a loop.
See Chapter 9 for details.
Reusing an edited loop in a different song
The fact that you can’t save edits to a loop in the Loop Browser makes it
harder to use edited loops in another song. But you can reuse that edited
loop if you like by following these steps:
1. Open the song that contains the loop that you want to reuse.
2. Copy the loop region to the Clipboard by choosing Edit➪Copy or
using the shortcut Ô-C.
3. Open a different (or new) song, create the appropriate type of track
for the loop (software or real instrument), and then paste it (choose
Edit➪Paste or press Ô-V) into that track.
It’s cumbersome, yes, but it makes sense within GarageBand’s consumer-
friendly approach to recording music. You’ll never screw up one of the
loops that came with the program — because you can’t.

Recording with MIDI and
Software Instruments

G
arageBand is more than just a recording studio-in-a-box; it’s also a pile
of high-quality musical instruments-in-a-box, just waiting to be played.
Pianos, guitars, drums, horns, synthesizers, and even a chorus of heavenly
voices are included; you can use them any way you like in your musical 
compositions.
You can play the software instruments with the built-in on-screen keyboard
(choose Window➪Keyboard or press Ô-K), but if you’re even half-serious
about making music, you’ll want to use a more piano-like MIDI keyboard,
such as the $99 M-Audio Keystation 49e, which I mention in Chapter 2.
What Is MIDI, Anyway?
MIDI stands for Musical Instrument Digital Interface and is pronounced
“Middy.” The term covers a lot of ground, as you can see from this descrip-
tion by the MIDI Manufacturer’s Association (www.midi.org):
The Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) enables people to use
multimedia computers and electronic musical instruments to create, enjoy
and learn about music. There are actually three components to MIDI, which
are the communications Protocol (language), the Connector (hardware
interface) and a distribution format called Standard MIDI Files.

In other words, MIDI is a language, a hardware interface, and a file format.
The language of MIDI allows different devices to talk to each other. The hard-
ware interface sends and receives MIDI information between devices that
speak MIDI. Finally, music that is made with MIDI can be saved in a file format
that can be understood by other MIDI devices.
The upshot is that many different kinds of devices that you may use in audio
(or video) production — such as keyboards, computers, mixing boards (con-
trol surfaces), and even lighting gear — can talk to each other in a common
language.
Controlling Software Instruments 
with a MIDI Keyboard
While MIDI is a multiheaded beast, in the context of using GarageBand, 
I focus on using a MIDI keyboard to play (control) GarageBand’s software
instruments.
Note that word control. MIDI keyboards are more appropriately called con-
trollers because you are using a familiar interface — a piano-like keyboard —
to control the software instruments on your Mac.
And, in fact, a pure MIDI keyboard is just that — a controller — and is inca-
pable of making any sound of its own. All it can do is send MIDI information
to a MIDI host (usually your Mac), which translates the information into
sound. To further complicate things, many MIDI keyboards are also synthe-
sizers, which can produce sound on their own. But even if your MIDI key-
board makes sounds all by itself, for the purposes of this chapter, think of it
as nothing more than a MIDI controller.
If your sound-making keyboard supports MIDI, you’ll see two ports labeled
something like MIDI In and MIDI Out. If so, you’ll also need a MIDI interface —
a small piece of hardware — to connect those MIDI In and MIDI Out ports on
the instrument to the USB port on your Mac.
In the pre-MIDI era, when you played a synthesizer or electric organ, it didn’t
control anything but its own internal circuitry. So each keyboard device pro-
duced only the sounds that its internal circuits knew how to make. This is 
why an Arp sounded like an Arp, a Moog sounded like a Moog, and a Prophet 5
sounded like — you guessed it — a Prophet 5. And any artist worth his or 
her salt had a rack of different synthesizer keyboards for producing different
sounds. We’ve come a long way since then; that rack of keyboards and much
more are built right into your copy of GarageBand.
116
Part II: Laying Down Tracks 

Here’s the bottom line: When you play a MIDI keyboard (controller), the key-
board isn’t producing sound. It’s noting the keys that you press and sending
that information to your Mac, where GarageBand translates it and plays that
sound with a software instrument. Conversely, when you strike a drum, the
sound occurs when the drumstick hits the drumhead. When you play an elec-
tric guitar, the sound occurs when the pick or a finger strikes the strings and
is captured “directly” by your Mac (see Chapter 8) or is fed through an ampli-
fier. And, when you play a piano, the sound occurs when the hammers hit the
strings.
MIDI controllers can also be used to control other keyboards or anything
that’s dedicated to the task of working with the MIDI protocol. For example,
“MIDI work surfaces” look like miniature versions of a big-time mixing board,
complete with sliding faders, rotating knobs, and VU meters with needles.
You use these work surfaces to control audio applications such as Logic, Pro
Tools, and others (but not GarageBand as of this writing, although I’m sure
you’ll see an inexpensive work surface for GarageBand soon).
I highly recommend using a MIDI keyboard if you are even half-serious about
recording with GarageBand. For purposes of this chapter, I assume that you are
using a USB keyboard like the M-Audio Keystation 49e keyboard ($99; www.
m-audio.com) that John Mayer demonstrated when Steve Jobs introduced
GarageBand at Macworld San Francisco 2004. You may even be able to find a
MIDI keyboard that’s cheaper, but you can’t go wrong with the Keystation 49e
for under $100. If you’re not sure that you want to spring for a keyboard yet,
don’t forget the on-screen keyboard that Apple thoughtfully included. To acti-
vate it, choose Window➪Keyboard or press Ô-K.
I can see that this is going to get confusing, so for the rest of the book, I’ll refer
to the keyboard on which you type letters and numbers as the “QWERTY key-
board.” Keyboards that have black-and-white piano-like keys will be referred
to as plain old “keyboards.”
You can use a MIDI keyboard (or GarageBand’s built-in on-screen keyboard)
to play the more than 50 software instruments that come with GarageBand.
If 50 instruments aren’t enough for you, Apple’s GarageBand Jam Pack ($99)
has over 100 additional instruments and 2,000 new loops. Or you can choose
from the abundance of third-party loops and software instruments that are
easily added to GarageBand — all you need is cash. (See Chapter 15 for
more info.)
Choosing Software Instruments
To record a software instrument, you create a software instrument track and
then choose the instrument for it.
117
Chapter 6: Recording with MIDI and Software Instruments

A software instrument may be more than one actual instrument. Drum kits,
for example, contain 50 or 60 different drum, cymbal, and percussion instru-
ment sounds, each triggered by a different key. So, for example, playing
middle C triggers the sound of a kick drum, D triggers the sound of a snare
drum, and D-sharp triggers the sound of a closed hi-hat.
Even though it contains 50 or 60 different instrument sounds, a drum kit is
considered a single software instrument. In any case, a track may contain the
sounds of many instruments, but they all have to be part of the same soft-
ware instrument, like those 50 or 60 different drum sounds.
Make sure that the type of software instrument you use matches the track
that you are recording on. When you select a software instrument for a track,
that instrument will play the MIDI notes on that track, even if they’re not the
right notes for that instrument. In other words, you can do horrible things to
a song if you’re not paying attention and drag, say, a drum region onto a track
that’s assigned to a piano. The notes will play on the drum kit and not the
piano; trust me, it’ll sound bloody awful. Hey, it’s just a dumb machine. It only
does what it’s told, and you told it to play drum music on a piano — so don’t
do that!
To set up a software instrument track, follow these steps:
1. Create a new song (if you haven’t already) by choosing File➪New or
by clicking the Create New Song button (if it appears when you open
GarageBand). If you have created a song, skip to Step 3.
2. When the Save As dialog box appears, save the song file.
See Chapter 4 for details about creating and saving a new song.
3. In the lower-left corner of the main song window, create a new track
by clicking the plus sign (+) below the track list, by choosing
Track➪New Track, or by pressing Ô-Option-N.
A new track appears with the New Track dialog box, as shown in 
Figure 6-1.
4. Because this is the software instruments chapter, click the Software
Instrument tab at the top of the New Track dialog box.
I talk about real instruments in Chapters 7 and 8.
5. On the left side of the New Track dialog box, select the category of
software instrument that you want.
6. On the right side, select the instruments in the category that you want
to play.
When you choose a software instrument, note that the icon in the lower-
left corner of the New Track dialog box changes and that each instru-
ment (or instrument family) has a different icon. This should, in theory,
help you keep track of what’s in your track list.
118
Part II: Laying Down Tracks 

You can change the icon by clicking it in the New Track dialog box (or
the Track Info window) and dragging it. A window that’s full of additional
icons appears. Drag to select the one that’s appropriate, and then
release the mouse button.
7. To see what the instrument you selected sounds like, play any note on
your keyboard.
Don’t be too quick to click the OK button; you can try out as many
instruments as you like before you click OK.
You can use the up-, down-, left-, and right-arrow keys on your QWERTY
keyboard to quickly change instruments.
8. When you’re happy with your instrument selection, click the OK
button.
You’re now ready to record a track with this instrument. You can find the
details about recording tracks in the next section.
Or, if you decide that you want to try a different software instrument (even if
you have already recorded on the track), follow these steps:
1. Open the Track Info window by double-clicking the track name, by
choosing Track➪Show/Hide Track Info, or by pressing Ô-I.
The Track Info window looks like the New Track dialog box, with some
additional settings. I talk about that in a moment; for now, the important
thing is to understand that you can choose another software instrument.
2. Choose a different instrument by clicking its name in the rightmost
column.
Figure 6-1:
Choose a
software
instrument.
119
Chapter 6: Recording with MIDI and Software Instruments

You can preview your selection in the Track Info window by playing a
note or notes on your keyboard. In fact, you can leave the Track Info
window open while you record, mix, or master. If you’re experimenting
with different instrument sounds, leaving the window open is incredibly
handy.
The change occurs as soon as you click the new instrument name and your
track instantly sounds different — perhaps completely different.
Recording Tracks with 
Software Instruments
After you create a new track and select a software instrument (see the previous
section), you’re ready to move on to the fun stuff — recording some music.
The funny thing is, this is either the hard part or the easy part, depending on
your musical chops. If you know your way around a keyboard, you’ll proba-
bly find it very easy to record a software instrument in GarageBand. Even if
you simply have a bit of theoretical knowledge, it will likely be a snap. But
even if you don’t have a shred of musical talent, it won’t take long for you to
figure out enough to make music, as long as you take the time to experiment.
GarageBand’s software instruments can sound like a million bucks — or like
a million cats fighting. In the immortal words of Peter Parker (also known as
Spiderman), “With great power comes great responsibility.” You hold the
power of an orchestra in your hand; please don’t abuse it.
After you have created the track and chosen the software instrument, you’re
ready to rock.
To practice, just play your keyboard with the appropriate track selected.
Because you are probably going to want to practice before laying down a new
track, you can either play solo (without clicking the Play button), or you can
click the Play button to play along with other tracks or loops in the project.
The selected track will be recorded. If you don’t hear what you expect, make
sure that you have the proper track selected and that no tracks have their
Solo or Mute button activated. If you don’t hear what you expected to hear,
the Solo or Mute button is often the culprit.
120
Part II: Laying Down Tracks 

If a track’s Solo button is activated, you hear only that track during recording
and playback; if a track’s Mute button is activated, you do not hear that track
during recording and playback.
To record a track, follow these steps:
1. Move the playhead to the point in your song where you want to record
or press Home to move the playhead to the beginning of the song.
GarageBand offers two features to help you record — the Metronome
and a Count In.
With the Metronome on, you hear a soft click marking the beat of your
song. (The sound of the Metronome is never recorded.)
You can hear the Metronome on playback only or on record and play-
back. Make your choice in GarageBand preferences, as I discuss in
Chapter 3.
2. If you want to use the Metronome, choose Control➪Metronome or
press Ô-U.
The Metronome is a toggle; it’s on when it has a check mark next to its
name in the menu.
The second useful feature for recording is the Count In. When you have
it turned on, you get an additional measure counted out before
GarageBand starts recording.
3. If you want to use the Count In, choose Control➪Count In (there is no
keyboard shortcut for this feature).
The Count In is a toggle; it’s on when it has a check mark next to its
name in the menu.
4. Click the Record button (the red dot) or press R, and recording begins.
That about covers it. As soon as you click the Record button or press R,
GarageBand begins to record everything that you play on your keyboard.
When you’re done, click the Play/Pause button or slap the spacebar to end
the recording.
Altering the Sound of Software
Instruments
Apple made GarageBand incredibly powerful for a so-called “consumer”
application. It could have gotten away with just the presets, but the company
put in the power for those who need it. Ergo, GarageBand lets you edit soft-
ware instrument presets to your heart’s content to get a different sound.
121
Chapter 6: Recording with MIDI and Software Instruments

Some users will be perfectly happy with every software instrument just the
way it sounds right out of the box; they’ll never even click the Details trian-
gle. But for the rest of us, Apple makes it easy to twiddle the sound of a soft-
ware instrument, which can be a very good thing. If your drum track lacks
bass, you can add more bass to it with an equalizer. If your piano doesn’t
sound like a piano, you can add echo, reverb, compression, and equalization
effects until it sounds perfect to your ear. Almost anything you can think of
doing to change the sound of an instrument can be done with the audio
effects built into GarageBand.
This is a quick bird’s-eye view of how to make the magic happen, for those of
you who just can’t wait. Don’t worry if it seems daunting; you find out all about
using those generators and effects in just a moment (and it’s easy — all you
need are your ears):
1. Select the track you want to alter by clicking its name.
2. Open the track’s Track Info window by double-clicking its name in the
Tracks column, choosing Tracks➪Show Track Info, or using the key-
board shortcut, Ô-I.
3. Click the triangle that’s next to the word Details at the bottom of the
window.
You reveal a dazzling array of options, including generators, compres-
sors, equalizers, echo, reverb, and more. You discover more about these
effects in the upcoming section, “Adding and changing effects.”
4. Choose a generator from the Generator menu and/or select the check
boxes for the effects you want to enable.
The next sections involve changing generator and effect presets, so please be
careful! I know I’ve said it before, but since you’re about to mess with the pre-
sets, I wanted to remind you that if you save any changes you make to the
preset without changing its name, you’re saving those changes permanently —
and perhaps blowing away the hard work of those Apple employees who were
paid to make the presets sound fabulous. So be careful when you save.
Tweaking an instrument’s generator
The generator is the foundation for every software instrument. If you change
the generator for a software instrument, you drastically alter the sound of the
instrument. If you’re looking for an unusual sound, one that you may not oth-
erwise come across in GarageBand, changing a software instrument’s genera-
tor is a good place to start.
As you can see in Figure 6-2, you have fewer than 20 generators.
122
Part II: Laying Down Tracks 

Among the Generator and Effects options in the Track Info window, you can
see some little triangles in the space between the two columns. Logically, you
would expect that clicking a triangle would reveal additional options, but you
would be wrong — clicking these triangles does nothing. As far as I can tell,
they’re just for decoration, which seems pretty lame to me.
To the right of the Generator menu is its Presets menu, which says, “Manual”
in Figure 6-2. You choose the Generator from the menu on the left, and then
choose a preset for that Generator from the menu on the right. The little
pencil button, which I get to in a moment, opens the settings window for that
generator.
Many presets have a name that’s similar to the name of the software instru-
ment; other preset names bear no relation whatsoever to the sound that you
hear.
For example, Figure 6-3 shows the Preset menu for a Mallet instrument called
“Aurora Bell.” This instrument sounds more like an old clavinet or organ than
any kind of bell, at least to me. And as you can see, it’s built using the Digital
Basic generator and the FM Polysynth preset, neither of which bring bells 
(or clavinets or organs, for that matter) to mind.
Figure 6-2:
From
piano to
percussion
instruments
and from

123
Chapter 6: Recording with MIDI and Software Instruments

The point is that you really should try every preset, regardless of whether it
has a dorky name. You never know which preset is going to be “the one,” so
here’s a hint: It is frequently the one with a dorky name.
But wait, there’s more! Do you see the little pencil icon? That’s the Edit button
for the preset. If you click the pencil button you can twiddle the settings for
this preset.
Each instrument has a different group of attributes, and the controls offered
by any preset may be specific to that instrument. So, for example, when you
click the Edit button for a Generator (or an effect), you may see slider con-
trols for Volume, Cutoff, and Release. Or you may find sliders for Mix, Tuning,
and Harmonics, or Timbre, Attack, Decay, and Release. That’s barely scratch-
ing the surface.
Alas, delving further into the details is beyond the purview of this book. Suffice
it to say that if you want to tweak a software instrument, there’s never a short-
age of options. If you are looking for something completely different, play
around with the generators and their presets.
Figure 6-3:

124
Part II: Laying Down Tracks 

Adding and changing effects
Each instrument also has its own Effects settings, and like the Generators,
each effect has its own preset menu and presets that can be edited as needed.
The four effects present (although not always turned on) on all software
instruments are Compressor, Equalizer, Echo, and Reverb.
Compressor
The Compressor does just what its name suggests: It compresses sound. It’s
hard to explain what something sounds like using only words, so suffice it to
say that compressing an instrument track is going to do something in between
making it louder and making it more intense. Technically, it’s making the softer
passages louder and the loudest passages less loud. Unless you crank the
Compressor to 100, its effect will be subtle, but if you have an instrument
track with a lot of dynamic range, you should definitely add a little Compressor
effect to it.
To adjust the Compressor, select or deselect the check box to turn it on or
off. If it is turned on, you can adjust the intensity of the effect by moving the
slider to the left (for less effect) or to the right (for more).
You may have to lower the volume level of the track as you increase the com-
pression; just keep an eye on the LED lights and take the level down a notch
or two if you start seeing red.
Equalizer
The Equalizer is like EQ on your home stereo or iTunes: It enables you to
adjust the relative loudness of different parts of the sound spectrum. So, for
example, if the cymbals on your drum track don’t sizzle and hiss enough for
your ears, try the Add Brightness preset, which will emphasize the high fre-
quencies on the track. Or, if your software instrument guitar sounds wimpy to
you, check out the Improve Guitars preset, which adds a bit of emphasis to
both the low and high frequencies on the track.
GarageBand comes with a number of presets for EQ, as shown in Figure 6-4.
In this case, the names are mostly descriptive.
In recording terms, brightness usually means treble; fullness usually refers
to sounds in the middle ranges; and flat means neutral equalization for all 
frequencies.
125
Chapter 6: Recording with MIDI and Software Instruments

The best way to understand what each preset does to the sound of an instru-
ment is to apply it to your own tracks. It’s harmless — if you don’t like the
sound it creates, either choose a different preset or deselect the check box to
turn the Equalizer off.
If none of the presets does the trick, GarageBand also offers manual adjust-
ments for Bass Gain, Mid Gain, Mid Frequency, and Treble Gain, as shown in
Figure 6-5. To access these settings, click the pencil icon that’s next to the
Preset menu.
The settings in the Equalizer window are as follows:
 Bass Gain: Boosts or cuts the low frequencies. You hear its effects most
on the bass guitar (or string bass) and kick drum, which both contain a
lot of low frequency information.
 Mid Gain: Boosts or cuts the midrange frequencies. You hear its effects
on vocals, guitars, horns, strings, and almost everything.
 Mid Frequency: Sets the frequencies affected by the Mid Gain control;
sliding the control towards Low chooses the lower midrange frequencies
and sliding it towards High chooses higher midrange frequencies.
Figure 6-4:
You can
choose from
a variety of

126
Part II: Laying Down Tracks 

 Treble Gain: Boosts or cuts the high frequencies. You hear its effects
most on instruments that play in the higher registers, such as cymbals,
flutes, and guitar solos.
Echo
What what exactly exactly is is echo echo??
Hey, is there an echo in here? Okay, it’s a groaner, but I couldn’t resist. It’s the
easiest way that I know to explain the sound of echo.
Each software instrument can have an echo applied to it. When used judi-
ciously, echo is a potent effect. And, as usual, GarageBand makes using this
feature simple. Merely turn the Echo effect on or off by selecting or deselect-
ing its check box. When Echo is on for a track, you can adjust its intensity
from 0 to 100 using the slider.
Adjusting the intensity of the Echo effect can change how loud the echoes
are and how long they last. Move the slider to the right, and the first echo is
louder than the original note — and lasts for several echoes. Move it to the
left, and the echo gets fainter.
You apply echo (and reverb) to make your track sound more lifelike and 
realistic. By adjusting echo (and reverb) you can simulate the sound of the
instrument being played in a spacious cathedral or a sound-deadened record-
ing studio. It’s your call — let your ears be your guide.
Figure 6-5:
You can
create
manual
settings

equalizer by
clicking the
Edit button.
127
Chapter 6: Recording with MIDI and Software Instruments

Reverb
Reverb is another important effect, perhaps the most-used in recording his-
tory. Reverb is technically a kind of echo, but it’s more of a bouncing-off-the-
walls-all-around-you sound than the repeated sound of echo.
Weird Al Yankovic recorded “Another One Rides the Bus” in a bathroom with
just his accordion. In fact, recording engineers love bathrooms for recording
because their hard surfaces give the recording a rich, warm, natural reverb.
You can get the bathroom effect with GarageBand by cranking up the echo
and the reverb.
Select or deselect the check box to turn Reverb on or off. The slider adjusts
the intensity. The farther you move the slider to the right, the bigger the
sound of the room. Slide it to the left, and you add just a bit of ambient
reverb that makes many instruments sound more realistic.
The first electronically produced reverb effects used springs to create the
reverberation effect. The effect was like listening in an enclosed room (like
the aforementioned bathroom, only springier, or more accurately, more
metallic). In fact, many early guitar amps had springs built in to provide that
spring reverb sound. And many engineers use a bathroom as an isolation
booth for a guitar amp. They run a long microphone cable into the bathroom
and record the amp sitting in the middle of this very live room with all its
hard surfaces and reverberation.
Other Effects
In addition to the Compressor, Equalizer, Echo, and Reverb effects, each soft-
ware instrument can have one or two additional effects. In Figure 6-6, the
Rotary Vibraphone has one effect applied — Bass Reduction — but look at all
those other choices!
Of course, you can choose from the presets that each effect includes or you
can click the pencil icon and create your own settings. As with the Generator
menu, the settings for each effect may be specific to that particular effect,
and some effects have fewer options than others.
For laughs, I added some distortion to Rotary Vibraphone, as shown in 
Figure 6-7.
If necessary, I can tweak Distortion 3 by clicking the Edit button and adjusting
the sliders. Figure 6-8 shows the settings for the distortion effect.
128
Part II: Laying Down Tracks 

Remember earlier in the chapter when I warned you about saving presets
with a different name to avoid blowing away your Apple-created presets?
Here’s how you actually do it:
After you have made a manual adjustment, you can either leave it as manual
or make it permanent by choosing Make Preset in the Preset menu, as I have
done in Figure 6-9. Just change the preset name to something that’s unique
and easy to remember.

130
Part II: Laying Down Tracks 

If you go around calling all your presets something like “Custom 1-20,” you’ll
quickly lose track of them. Try naming your presets after the instrument that
you are using or perhaps after something that’s specific to your song. That
way, you can more easily remember what that preset is when you come back
to it later.
You can add a second effect to each software instrument, too; just select the
second check box and Effects menu to choose the second effect.
Look for a reason to leave it alone! Too many effects on an instrument can
ruin it by making it sound muddy — or just plain stupid. Most of the software
instruments sound quite good without any tweaking. If you want to add
something, but aren’t sure what, try adding a little reverb, chorus, or echo.
You don’t need to add effects to every instrument; sometimes it’s best to
leave things alone.
Testing your changes
When you’re not sure what an effect does to the sound, here’s the best way I
know to get familiar with how an effect affects sound:
1. Click the track’s Solo button to listen to only that track.
2. Open the Track Info window and turn off the effect in question by
making sure its check box is deselected.
3. Click the Play button or press the spacebar and listen to the track in
its natural state.
4. Turn on the effect by selecting its check box.
5. Now, while the track plays, increase the effect’s intensity with the
slider until you can definitely hear it. 
6. Now move the slider back to the left until you can only just barely
hear the effect. 
The perfect setting is probably between those two points.

Chapter 7
Recording Vocals and
Acoustic Instruments
In This Chapter
 Choosing a microphone
 Recording with microphones
 Improving the sound of recordings
T
his chapter cuts to the heart of audio recording — using a microphone or
microphones to record vocals and instruments. As usual, Apple has done
much of the heavy lifting already by including several dozen presets that you
can use to change the sound of your recorded vocals and instruments. This
means that you, as the recording engineer, don’t have to worry as much about
what type of microphone you should use to record which instrument or how
much echo to apply to a grand piano, for example. The presets do it all for
you — and quite nicely I might add.
And so, when you record with GarageBand, you can use almost any micro-
phone that you have handy and then apply a preset to get a more profes-
sional and polished sound out of it.
That said, the type of microphone that you use does have an effect on the
quality of your recording. And some mics work better for vocals and instru-
ments than others. You can find all the details about choosing a mic in
Chapter 2. In this chapter, you find out how to set up and position micro-
phones for recording, and then I offer some advice, tips, and hints about
making better recordings.
Before you start though, keep in mind that recording with microphones is an
art, a science, and a skill; don’t expect to master it all at once. So many things
affect the sound that you record; it’s going to take time for you to understand
how these factors interact.
There’s a lot to cover, so let’s rock.

Getting Ready to Record
I’m going to assume that you’ve got some kind of microphone at hand and are
ready to commence recording with it. But, before you record a single note, you
have a few things to attend to if you want to end up with great-sounding tracks.
The two things that you need to master first are microphone placement and
level setting. If you nail those two, you’ll get better results.
At this point, I wouldn’t recommend spending a whole lot of time trying to
deaden the room (see Chapter 2 for details); rather, I suggest that you get
the microphone placed and record (or monitor) the sound first. When you
hear it set up the way that you plan to record, you can decide whether you
have too much room sound coloring the track and adjust accordingly.
I guarantee that you’ll record better-sounding tracks if you read the rest of
this chapter than if you don’t.
Setting up your mic and recording track
When your room setup is as good as it gets, it’s time to set up your mic(s).
Perhaps the most important factor in what ends up being recorded is the
position of the microphone during recording. Your job is to position the
microphone where it sounds the best to your ear. But to do that, you need
to make the microphone “live” so that you can hear the effect of reposition-
ing it.
To set up your mic so that it’s live and then create the track to record on,
follow these steps:
1. Mute or disconnect your speakers.
Most Macs have a mute key on the keyboard as well as a volume control
slider in the menu bar, which you can slide to its lowest setting to mute
your speakers.
If your speakers are connected to an audio interface that’s connected to
your Mac, you’re on your own as to how to mute your speakers. Probably
by turning the audio interface off (if you can; some bus-powered inter-
faces are always on as long as they’re connected to a USB or FireWire
port on your Mac).
2. If your Mac has a built-in microphone, as most modern Macs do, choose
Apple Menu➪System Preferences, click the Sound icon, and then click
the Input tab. Now make sure that Internal microphone is not selected
for input.
134
Part II: Laying Down Tracks 

Should you not follow Steps 1 and 2, you will hear awful high-pitched
howling, known as feedback, as soon as you monitor your real instru-
ment track.
You have to tell GarageBand which input and output device to use in the
Audio/MIDI Preferences pane. If you haven’t done that or have selected
the wrong input or output device, you may not be able to hear or record
until you choose the right input and output. See Chapter 3 for details on
setting your preferences.
3. Connect your headphones to your input source, which is often the
headphone jack on your Mac.
4. To double-check that you won’t sear your ears with feedback, test
your setup before you connect your mic by playing an existing track
in GarageBand.
If you hear the track through anything but the headphones, review
the preceding steps to mute or disconnect the speakers (or your
Mac’s built-in mic) before you continue.
When the only sound that you can hear comes out of the headphones,
you’re good to go.
5. Open a GarageBand project, or create a new one.
Choose File➪Open or File➪New or use the shortcuts Ô-O and Ô-N,
respectively. See Chapter 4 for details on creating new projects.
6. Create a new track by choosing Track➪New Track or using the short-
cut Ô-Option-N, and click the Real Instrument tab at the top of the New
Track dialog box that appears.
7. Choose the appropriate instrument category in the left column.
You want to choose the category that best describes the instrument
or vocal part you’re recording. Here’s a breakdown of the different
categories:
• Band Instruments: Choose this for recording horns (trumpet, trom-
bones, saxophone), flutes, violins, or other orchestral instruments
you might find in a performing band.
• Basic Track: Select this to record a basic track with no effects
applied. You will rarely want to use a basic track without effects in
a song. More likely you would choose this category to start from
scratch and specify and apply all the effects for the track yourself.
• Bass: Select this category to record instruments such as a bass
guitar, string bass, electric string bass, and so on.
• Drums: Pick this category for (what else) drums or percussion
instruments.
135
Chapter 7: Recording Vocals and Acoustic Instruments

• Effects: Choose this category to use strange treatments that make
your voice or instrument sound strange, weird, or unearthly.
My favorite effect preset is Telephone Lines, which makes your
voice sound like it’s coming through the earpiece of a very bad
telephone. Way cool.
• Guitars: Use this category to record your guitar — electric (con-
nected directly or played through an amp and captured with a
microphone, as explained in Chapter 8) or acoustic (played into 
a microphone).
• Vocals: Select this category to make your vocals sound like a mil-
lion bucks.
8. Choose a preset for that category in the right column.
The presets are sub-categories. Choose the one that best describes the
instrument or vocal you’re about to record.
You can play and pause your song with the New Track dialog box open,
like the Track Info window. So you can audition many presets before you
click the OK button.
9. Select an input channel from the Input pop-up menu. In plain English,
this means selecting the port or device that that instrument is currently
plugged into.
If you plugged a microphone or instrument directly into your Mac, the
correct choice is almost always Channel 1. But if your mic or instrument
is plugged into an audio interface, choose the channel that you’re plugged
into on the device.
10. Select either the Mono or Stereo Format radio buttons below the Input
menu. These buttons allow you to choose between recording in mono
(single-channel) or stereo (two-channel) sound. Most of the time, you’ll
be recording one channel of sound at a time, so Mono is usually the
best choice here.
Because GarageBand only allows you to record one track at a time, you
may wonder why it even has a Stereo button. Here’s why: If you have an
audio interface with two or more inputs, you can record two channels at
once, although both are recorded on a single GarageBand track.
A track that’s made with the Format button set to Stereo isn’t real stereo.
Even if you used two separate microphones or recorded two separate
vocalists or instruments, they are recorded onto a single track. And if
it’s just one track, it’s not stereo, is it?
If you choose Stereo, the Input pop-up menu changes. So, instead of
seeing one track name, you see Channels 1/2 or Channels 3/4, to denote
that tracks 1 and 2 (or 3 and 4) on your audio interface are enabled.
136
Part II: Laying Down Tracks 

11. Click the On radio button for Monitor (so that you can hear yourself
play or sing as well as hear backing tracks through your headphones).
Your New Track dialog box should look like Figure 7-1.
12. Click the OK button.
Your mic should now be live and your track ready for recording.
With headphones on, speak into the mic. If you hear yourself, you’re golden.
If you don’t hear yourself (and see the track’s level-meter LEDs light up), here
are things to consider (in no particular order):
 Make sure that all your cables are firmly connected.
 Make sure that the correct devices are selected for input and output in
GarageBand’s Preferences pane. (Open GarageBand Preferences, click
the Audio/MIDI tab, and choose the appropriate input and output devices
from the Audio Input and Output menus.)
 Make sure that the proper track is selected (you can’t record a track
unless it’s selected).
 Make sure that the track you’re recording doesn’t have its mute button
illuminated.
 Make sure that no other track has its solo button illuminated.
 Make sure that the volume slider isn’t all the way to the left.
 Make sure that the mic is turned on (not all mics have on/off switches,
but some do).
Figure 7-1:

Chapter 7: Recording Vocals and Acoustic Instruments

 Make sure that the audio inputs in System Preferences and/or your
audio interface are turned up.
 Make sure that the selected output device isn’t muted (if that’s the
output you’re using).
 Make sure that you can hear other sounds through the selected output
device to see whether the problem is your headphones (and not your
mic setup).
If none of this works, try a different mic or a different input.
138
Part II: Laying Down Tracks 
Stereo versus mono
While GarageBand can only record one track at
a time, it can record that track in stereo if you
have two microphones available (that is, plugged
into your input source). While some instruments
can sound better when recorded using two
microphones, it’s usually more effort than it’s
worth.
If you care to try it, it’s no big deal as long as you
have an audio interface with two or more inputs.
If so, create a real instrument track and choose
the Stereo Format radio button, as shown in the
following figure.
Now connect a microphone or instrument to
two inputs (channels 1 and 2) on your audio
interface, set your levels as before, and record.
You need to know one more thing if you’re going
to record in stereo. Called the 3:1 (or 5:1) rule, it
goes something like this: If you use multiple
microphones, the distance between the mics
should be 3 to 5 times the distance between the
mic and the sound source (vocalist, instrument,
or amplifier). This prevents your recording from
sounding dull or blurry due to phase-cancellation
issues. You can ignore the rule, however, if both
mics are cardioid and are placed back to back
(that is, aimed in opposite directions).

Tweaking the pan to hear vocals better
The pan settings control where a sound is coming from in the stereo field —
that is, from the left or right. Although it’s more effective to wait and fine-tune
pan settings for each track when you mix and master, a simple tweak to the
pan settings may help you hear vocals better in your headphones.
Here’s how it works: Pan a track or more than one track hard left or right and
pan the track that you’re recording hard, but to the opposite side. This way,
you hear the previously recorded instrument or voice tracks in one ear and
the track that you’re currently recording in the other ear. Some musicians and
singers find this less confusing than hearing everything in both ears. Try it
and see if it works for you. I find it particularly helpful for recording harmony
vocals.
Positioning the microphone
Assuming that you can hear the input from the microphone in your cans (see
the preceding section for details), it’s time to adjust the mic’s position for opti-
mal recording. For most microphones in most situations, the optimal distance
from the sound source is from 6 inches to 2 feet. Most vocals are recorded
using a classic “close mic” technique, where the microphone is 6 inches or
less from the vocalist’s lips.
Many mics pick up sound in a cardioid pattern (see Chapter 2), which is the
preferred pattern for vocals and most single-instrument recordings. The closer
you move a cardioid pattern mic to the sound source, the more bass response
you hear. This is known as the proximity effect. You can really hear this effect
in your cans (headphones) as you move the sound source and microphone
closer together or farther apart.
Because cardioid-pattern mics pick up sound directly in front of them better
than from the back or sides, changing the orientation of the mic can dramati-
cally change what you hear. So don’t just move it closer and farther away —
change the angle or direction that the mic is pointed in, too.
And by the way, that whole “6 inches to 2 feet” thing isn’t etched in stone (or
anything else for that matter). If your oboe sounds fantastic when the mic is
exactly 3.75 feet away from the whatever-you-call-the-hole-the-sound-comes-
out-of, fantastic! The point I’m making is that there are no rules, and you can
only find the sweet spot for a mic by experimenting with its placement.
After you’re happy with your mic’s placement, you’re ready to set the levels.
See the next section for details about how to do this.
139
Chapter 7: Recording Vocals and Acoustic Instruments

Setting levels
When the mic is positioned and sounds its best to you, fine-tune your record-
ing level for the track. Because you’re recording real audio (and not a software
instrument), you can’t change the recording level later. If you record the track
“too hot” or “too cool” (with too much or too little level), the track will be dis-
torted or too quiet.
If you “spike” into the red zone once or twice (or even more) during a perfor-
mance, don’t lose hope. You may be able to use the rubber band Track Volume
controller to lower the volume during those hot passages. If you don’t have
too much distortion in the recording (from being too hot) and with other
tracks blended in, your track may be fine that way.
It’s always better to record at the right level, though. If you overdrive a track
by recording it too hot or record the track too cool (quietly), you risk losing
a great performance. So play it safe and keep your levels under control when
you record. And when you mix. And when you master.
To set the levels before you record a take, play or sing a bit of the song that
you want to record and watch the levels on LED display, which you find in the
Mixer column for that track. What do you look for to get a proper recording
level? Check out Figure 7-2 to find your answers. The top image shows levels
that are too cool. The two pictures in the middle represent a good range of
recording levels. The bottom one is too hot.
You want the recording level as green as possible, without much (or any)
yellow (too low) and even less red (too hot). However, an occasional spike
near the red, as shown in the third picture down in Figure 7-2, won’t hurt you.
140
Part II: Laying Down Tracks 
Things you should know about using
(and not using) a microphone
When you’re not using a microphone, you should
store it somewhere cool, clean, and dry. Many
microphones include a leather or faux leather
pouch; it’s a good place to store the mic when
it’s not in use. At least cover the mic with a piece
of cloth or an upside-down plastic bag. (Don’t
seal the bag; just let it hang over the mic.) If you
keep dust and airborne gunk away from your
mic, it will perform better and last longer.
If you spit or spray when you sing, use a pop
screen to minimize the amount of saliva that
gets onto the mic. Saliva isn’t a good thing where
delicate electronic devices are concerned, so if
you spray, spit, or drool onto your mic, dry it
gently with a soft cloth as soon as possible.
Do not try to blow a mic dry with a hair dryer or
compressed air in a can; either can render the
mic inoperable. So don’t do that, OK?

But don’t let it stay that hot for long. If you see all the red LEDs lit up, like
they are in the bottom picture in Figure 7-2, your recording will almost cer-
tainly be distorted and may be unusable.
If your tracks are too cool or too hot, first try adding a bit of compression,
which I discuss in more detail in the next section. Then play a bit of your
song again to see whether that puts you in the green. If that doesn’t work,
try adjusting the level by sliding the level fader to the left. Keep tweaking
compression and levels until you find the right amount of level that gives
you a useable track. You can find more details about adjusting levels in
Chapter 4.
Finally, memorize my late, great uncle Yogi’s mantra for recording levels,
and things will be fine:
Lots of green, it’s sweet and clean;
Too much red, your track is dead.
Adding effects
One way of making a track sound different or better is to add effects to it.
In the past, the rule was to use as few effects as possible during recording.
The object was to keep what was on tape as pristine as possible. If you
recorded a track with, for example, echo and reverb, and later decided
that you didn’t want echo and reverb, or wanted less of it, you were stuck.
The track on tape had the echo and reverb in its DNA. Sometimes it was
necessary to add some compression or equalization to a track during record-
ing, but most other effects were added later, giving you the option of using
them or not.
You have no such limitation because GarageBand uses effects that are
nondestructive — meaning that you hear the effects in real time but
they’re not applied to your tracks until you export the project. And that,
my friends, is a really good thing.
Too cool (quiet)

Chapter 7: Recording Vocals and Acoustic Instruments

The upshot is that you no longer have to worry about spoiling a take by adding
an effect. If you don’t like the effect, you can remove it. No harm, no foul.
If you’re a veteran of analog recording, this probably seems like a miracle. In
the old days, effects were usually outboard hardware devices that were filled
with strange DSP chips capable of such real-time shenanigans. Today, our G4
and G5 processors are more than powerful enough to add effects such as these
on the fly.
It’s nice to know that you can add the effects at any time. So add ’em or not
as you like — you won’t hurt anything. So knock yourself out choosing differ-
ent presets and adjusting the EQ, reverb, and echo — whatever rocks your
boat.
That said, with most of the effects, you don’t gain a great advantage adding
them before recording. But compression is a special case. Even in the old days,
sometimes it was best to add a bit of compression to an instrument or voice
before committing it to tape. And the same holds true for GarageBand.
Anytime that you have a track that has hot spots — but not too many of 
them — you may be able to bring the loudest and softest parts closer together
by adding a bit of compression. I almost always add some compression to my
vocals, guitar, bass, and drum tracks. There’s not much I don’t compress at
least a small amount. So before you lower the level of the entire track or turn
on the Track Volume control, try adding a small amount of compression. You
should see less yellow and red in the LED level displays, and you should be
able to hear softer passages better than before. A bit of compression can free
you from having to “ride the faders” (or “diddle the Track Volume rubber
band controls,” in GarageBand parlance) to compensate for loud and soft
portions.
The small amount is key. While a little compression can make a track that’s
too hot in some parts and too cool in others sound better, too much com-
pression can make it sound artificial and even robotic.
To add just the right amount of compression for a vocal or acoustic instru-
ment track, follow these steps:
1. Begin playing your song by clicking the Play button or pressing the
spacebar.
2. Open the Track Info window by choosing Track➪Track Info or by
pressing Ô-I.
3. Turn Compression on by making sure its check box is selected.
4. Slide the fader to the right while listening closely.
You may want to click the Solo button for the track so you can hear it
more clearly.
142
Part II: Laying Down Tracks 

5. Slide the fader to the left and right until you like what you hear.
6. Check your levels again (see the section, “Setting levels,” earlier in
this chapter).
You may have to slide the track’s level slider to the left or right by a small
amount to achieve the best level for the track after you’ve added compres-
sion or changed your compression settings.
143
Chapter 7: Recording Vocals and Acoustic Instruments
Proof of nondestructive effects
In the old days, you had to be careful adding
compression to tracks because after you added
it, the compression was recorded on the tape
and couldn’t be removed. GarageBand and other
modern recording software break that rule in a
big way by making all of their effects “nonde-
structive.” Here’s how to see it for yourself:
1. Create a new project and record a track
using a preset that adds a distinctive sound.
If you play guitar, Arena Rock is a fine
choice; for vocals, try Pop Vocals.
2. Save the project and exit GarageBand.
3. Locate the file on your hard drive, Control-
click it, and choose Show Package
Contents from the contextual menu, as
shown in the following figure.
4. Open the Media folder in the project
package window, and you’ll see at least
one file with a name something like
Recording#02.aif, as shown in the fol-
lowing figure.
(continued)

Checking for unwanted noise
Before you start recording your tracks, listen carefully once more for extrane-
ous noise. Is the air conditioner or refrigerator running? (Better catch it before
it runs away.) If you live in the South, listen for those ceiling fans; if you’re a
Northerner, listen for steam pipes or oil heaters clanging; no matter where
you live, listen for jet planes flying overhead and big trucks driving by out-
side your window.
If you hear anything but your voice or instrument in the cans, your take could
be spoiled.
If you’re recording vocals, listen carefully and make sure that no sound from
your headphones leaks into the mic when you sing. If it does, reduce the head-
phone output (the better choice) or back away from the mic a little (which may
hurt your recording quality and is less likely to work).
See Chapter 2 for a checklist that can help you prevent background noise
from showing up on your tracks.
Not for drummers only
Recording drums one track at a time using one microphone is a drag. So
stereo recording has more significance for drummers and anyone else who
would like to record with more than one microphone. While GarageBand lets
you record in stereo, the procedure isn’t for the faint of heart (or wallet).
Alas, I am not a drummer and don’t even play one on TV, so I asked my friend
and colleague Dave Hamilton, who happens to be a real drummer (as well as
an avid GarageBand user), to help me out. He graciously contributed the info
on the two ways of recording drums in GarageBand that you’re about to read.
144
Part II: Laying Down Tracks 
This is the actual recording that you made — or
more accurately, what GarageBand wrote to
your hard drive when you recorded.
The easiest way to hear the recording is to
choose View➪As Columns (or press Ô-3) and
then click the Recording#.aif file so that
it’s selected. A preview column appears to its
right; click the Play button to hear what was
recorded, as shown in the previous figure.
It sounds just a wee bit different than it did
in GarageBand, doesn’t it? That’s because the
effects that you heard in your headphones
while you recorded the track were added on
the fly but not written to the hard drive. And
that is the proof that GarageBand effects are
nondestructive.
(continued)

Just so you know, Dave is the drummer for the greatest garage band you
never heard, The Macworld All-Star Band; he is also the CEO of BackBeat
Media and President of The Mac Observer. He has played and toured with
members of the Dave Matthews Band, played in the horn section for Phish,
and played in David Letterman’s CBS Late Night Orchestra. So he’s the real
deal.
Dave is also an underrated writer whose work has appeared in MacAddict and
The Mac Observer as well as other Mac publications (but not often enough, if
you ask me).
Now, without further ado, here’s Dave’s take (pun intended) on recording
drums with GarageBand:
The one place where GarageBand falls short is in recording live drums.
GarageBand’s limitation of recording one track at a time (albeit on a two-
channel stereo track) leaves many would-be home engineers scratching
their respective heads. Recording drums requires a minimum of three
microphones (although you can use more if you want), and GarageBand
is just not built to accept that. Don’t fret — I’ve got two solutions for you,
depending on your needs.
One track at a time
One option is to let GarageBand dictate the way that you record — that being
one track at a time. Because you’ll be recording one instrument at a time,
make sure that you have your song mapped out (either in your head or on
paper) from start to finish. Choose your first instrument — the hi-hat, for
example — and place your microphone accordingly. Then get your song set
up in GarageBand, set your tempo (you have to record using GarageBand’s
Metronome as a guide), put on a pair of headphones, and fire away. When
you’ve got that track the way you want it, move on to the next instrument.
Get your bass drum miced up the way you want it, put the headphones back
on, and go for it. Then do the snare, and so on.
As you can see, this is a very tedious process, but the result is tracks that are
clean and pristine. These tracks can be individually equalized and effected
within GarageBand, giving you complete control over the mix. You may lose
some of the “feel” of having a live drummer playing all the parts at once, but
that’s the trade-off.
Don’t want to make that trade-off, you say? Well, then, you have another
choice.
Record all drums to one track at once
In the end, your drums get mixed down with everything else, resulting in a
stereo, or two-track, signal. Well, nothing says that you can’t at least do some
of that mixing ahead of time.
145
Chapter 7: Recording Vocals and Acoustic Instruments

This solution requires the purchase of a stereo outboard mixer with a mini-
mum of six balanced inputs, preferably one with a built-in equalizer and
effects processor. I really like both the Mackie DFX-12 and the Behringer
Eurorack UB1222FX-Pro for this type of project. They both have on-board
effects (stereo, no less!) and are quite capable mixers with clean sounds.
Although the list price on the Mackie is nearly $500, with a little bit of
Googling, I found both the Mackie and the Behringer for less than $250.
After you’ve procured your mixer and connected it to your Mac (either
directly to your Mac’s sound-in port or to a higher-quality outboard USB
or FireWire audio interface), you’re ready to start. Follow these steps to
record with a mixer:
1. Position your microphones.
I found that I needed a minimum of three mics (one on the bass drum
and then two overheads to get a stereo image of the sound) for decent
results. You can, of course, move on past that and mic the snare, toms,
and individual cymbals, if you’re so inclined.
2. After you’ve got your microphones in place, connect them to the
microphone inputs on the mixer and start tweaking.
Assisted by a pair of isolating headphones, you should be able to get the
levels and equalization pretty close while sitting right at the drums. Use
the mixer’s on-board effects processor to add some life to the overheads
or individual drums, and then tweak the equalizer to your liking.
3. Use your mixer’s pan controls to split signals to the left and right, cre-
ating a balanced stereo image.
4. After you get a rough mix that suits you, create a New Basic Track in
GarageBand, open the Track Info window, and choose Drums in the
left column and No Effects in the right column.
Now you’re ready to hit the Record button and bash away, playing the
drum track naturally!
When you’re done, give it a listen back in GarageBand. If you decide that one
drum needs to be louder or softer, adjust that level on your mixer and — you
guessed it — re-record the entire track. While this can be time consuming at
first, when you get a mix that you like, things should go much more quickly
for subsequent recordings.
I always record all the drums on one track. I find that I get a much better feel
of the track if I play and record it “live.” Having figured out roughly where the
levels should be set, I can usually begin recording within five minutes of sit-
ting down at the drum kit.
146
Part II: Laying Down Tracks 

Whichever option you choose, you end up with a decent drum sound that
you can tweak to your heart’s content with GarageBand’s effects.
Happy recording!
Thanks, Dave.
Dave sent me an MP3 file of some drumming that he recorded using the three-
microphones-and-a-mixer setup that he described in this section. It sounded
just like drums (which is just what it should sound like).
Recording with a MIDI drum
There is one other option for recording drums: Use a MIDI drum controller
such as the Yamaha DD55 MIDI Digital Drum System shown in Figure 7-3. 
Yamaha Corporation of America, Consumer Products Division
Remember the MIDI keyboards I’ve been talking about throughout the book?
Think of the DD55 as serving the same purpose with a twist: Instead of send-
ing MIDI information when you press a key, the DD55 sends MIDI information
when you tap one of the seven touch-sensitive drum pads with a drumstick
or your hands. 
Figure 7-3:
Yamaha’s
DD55 looks,
feels, and
sounds like
real drums,
and sends

sensitive

information
to your Mac.
147
Chapter 7: Recording Vocals and Acoustic Instruments

The DD55 has 174 realistic-sounding drum voices you can assign to any of the
seven pads. Included are 100 drum kit presets, or you can create your own
dream kit using any of the 174 sounds. You also get a pair of cheap but usable
foot pedals, allowing you to “play” a kick drum, hi-hat, or any other voice with
your feet. And, of course, it offers MIDI In/Out so it can send MIDI information
to GarageBand, but it’s also self-amplified with built-in speakers, so you can
also use it standalone, without hooking it up to a computer. 
Any drummer will tell you how hard it is to “play” drums using a MIDI key-
board. Although I’m not a drummer, I’ve been using a DD55 for the past few
weeks, and the tracks I create with it sound significantly more realistic than
ones I create using a keyboard. 
Priced at around $200, the DD55 is an outstanding value if you need to record
drums that sound reasonably realistic. 
The DD55 uses standard MIDI cables, not USB, so you’ll need an inexpensive
MIDI interface to connect it to your Mac. Some USB MIDI keyboards have ports
for MIDI in/out. If so, you can connect the DD55 to the MIDI keyboard and avoid
the expense of a MIDI interface.
Recording the Track
Okay then, you’ve gotten everything ready to record. All that’s left is to actu-
ally record, and that’s a snap. Here’s how to do it:
1. Move the playhead to the point in your song where you want to begin
recording, or press Home to move the playhead to the start of the song.
GarageBand has two features to help you record — a Metronome and a
Count In.
2. If you want to use the Metronome, choose Control➪Metronome or
press Ô-U.
The Metronome is a toggle; it’s on when it has a check mark next to its
name in the menu.
The second useful feature for recording is the Count In. When you have it
turned on, you get an additional measure counted out before GarageBand
starts recording.
3. If you want to use the Count In, choose Control➪Count In (there is no
keyboard shortcut for this feature).
The Count In is a toggle; it’s on when it has a check mark next to its name
in the menu.
Use both features, or at least use the Metronome when you record. See
Chapter 6 for more details about these features.
148
Part II: Laying Down Tracks 

4. Click the Record button (the red dot) or press R, and the recording
begins.
Remember to watch your levels while you record.
5. When you’re done recording, click the Play/Pause button or press
the spacebar to end the recording.
Wasn’t that simple?
Improving the Sound of Recordings
Now, if you’ve been paying attention and haven’t killed the tracks that you’ve
recorded (remember uncle Yogi’s mantra: Too much red, your track is dead),
you can tinker with the sound to your heart’s content.
Remember that whole nondestructive thing from earlier in this chapter? If
not, it means that you can add and subtract effects without affecting the qual-
ity of your original track — until you master, that is.
So listen to what you’ve recorded now, and pay particular attention to both
the sound of the instrument or voice and the performance itself. Now add
some effects or change some presets (it’s just like adding effects and chang-
ing presets as discussed in Chapter 6), and then listen some more.
Are some parts too loud or too soft? Add a bit of compression, or use the Track
Volume rubber band controller to reduce the level. As shown in Figure 7-4, I
played these three chords way too loud for this part of the song; the Track
Volume rubber band let me reduce the level smoothly before the first chord
and increase it smoothly after the third one. See Chapter 9 for details on
using the Track Volume control.
These chords are too hot.

Chapter 7: Recording Vocals and Acoustic Instruments

If you hear other problems on a recording, don’t worry yet — small problems
can be fixed in several ways without redoing the entire track:
 If you hit a wrong note — or even three or four — read the section
in Chapter 9 about fixing flubs. You can find several techniques for edit-
ing out mistakes or for replacing mistakes with better performances.
 To fatten up the sound of almost any instrument or vocal track,
try double-tracking, which is an age-old production technique.
GarageBand gives you two ways to do this; each has pros and cons:
• Way 1: Duplicate the original guitar track (choose Track➪
Duplicate Track or use the shortcut, Ô-D) and copy and paste
the original guitar region onto the new track. This technique
is fast and easy, but unless you’re careful, it will sound mechan-
ical because both tracks are exactly the same. One way to soften
the effect is to change one of the tracks by adding effects try a
bit of Chorus and the doubled track sound sounds ethereal. Or
choose a preset with lots of distortion for one track and choose
a cleaner-sounding preset for the other.
• Way 2: Create a new track and record the part a second time,
playing or singing along with the original track. You want to
repeat your performance as precisely as you can, but because
you’re only human, the second recording will have small differ-
ences from the original track. So, while this technique can take
you more time, the differences between the two takes can
make this sound better than copying and pasting the same
performance.
 If you hear pitch problems in your recording, try using the Antares
Auto-tune pitch-correcting plug-in; it’s nothing short of a miracle.
(See Figure 7-5.) In a nutshell, this plug-in puts your voice or certain
instruments back on pitch if they wander off. See Chapter 15 for more
details.
 If you own other audio programs with VST plug-ins, try FXpansion’s
VST to Audio Unit Adapter, which can translate any VST plug-ins that
you own into Audio Units plug-ins that can be used with GarageBand.
So if you own another audio application that uses plug-ins in the VST
format (which many do), for example, all of its plug-ins can be available
to you in GarageBand for less than $100 (the cost of VST to Audio Unit
Adapter). You can find more details about the VST to Audio Unit Adapter
in Chapter 15, too.

I
n Chapters 6 and 7, I explain how to record software instruments and
vocal and acoustic instrument tracks. In this chapter, I explain how to
record another type of instrument: an amplified instrument, most notably
an electric guitar.
Throughout this chapter I’ll be using the electric guitar as an example
because that’s the instrument I play and what I have handy. Please don’t
misunderstand; the electric guitar is just one of the electronic or amplified
instruments you might record. So if you play another electronic instrument,
such as an electric piano, synthesizer, violin, bass, or whatever, merely sub-
stitute the name of your instrument wherever you see the word, “guitar.”
Overview from the Top: Recording
Direct or Live
Recording an electronic instrument with GarageBand is easier than with
most other software because, once again, Apple has done the heavy lifting
for you. This time they’ve included built-in guitar amplifier models with pre-
sets designed by professional recording engineers; any guitar can play with
a vintage British Invasion sound, the reverb-laden distortion of Arena Rock,
the dulcet tones of Clean Jazz, or many others.

Even a crummy guitar that sounds like garbage when you use an amplifier
may sound great when heard through one of GarageBand’s amp models. If
you’ve got a guitar handy, give it a try even if you’re not a guitar player. It’s
very cool.
There’s another way recording electronic instruments with GarageBand is
easy: GarageBand doesn’t require you to plug your guitar into a traditional
amplifier when you record an electronic instrument. You plug the instru-
ment into your Mac (or into an audio interface connected to your Mac) and
GarageBand adds the sound of the amplifier, which you hear as you play.
Slick.
In the recording industry, plugging an electric guitar (or other electronic
instrument) directly into your computer is called recording direct. I recom-
mend recording direct whenever possible. Unless you have a lot of time to
experiment with an amplifier and a microphone, you’ll get better results
this way.
But, I realize that recording direct may run contrary to the beliefs of purists
and pros and that some recording engineers and producers prefer to capture
the unique interplay of guitar and amplifier by recording the guitar and ampli-
fier live, using a microphone or microphones.
If you want to record your guitar live, you can find everything you need to
know about setting up and recording with microphones in Chapter 7. But,
because amplifiers are notoriously difficult to record well, I’ve got a few tips
and hints for those of you who insist on doing this the harder way, too.
Twenty or thirty years ago the technology wasn’t good enough to record
direct. In the old days, all electric guitar and bass tracks were recorded,
“live,” by micing the amp. Today, amp modeling and sound shaping software
have gotten so spectacular sounding that many popular artists play through
modeled amps on stage and in recording. Paul Kent, lead guitarist for the
Macworld All-Star Band, played our entire last gig sans amplifier through
an amp modeler patched directly into the house sound system. It sounded
great and, as a pleasant side effect, the sound pressure level onstage was
lower than it’s ever been, which meant we could hear ourselves playing and
singing.
I hardly use my amp at all anymore; when I just want to play, I open
GarageBand and play without recording.
154
Part II: Laying Down Tracks 

Recording Direct with GarageBand’s
Virtual Amplifiers
When you record direct, you bypass amplification completely and plug your
instrument directly into your Mac. When you play, the sound comes out of
your Mac speakers. You can change your instrument sounds by selecting a
different real instrument or preset.
Setting up to record
Before you begin, you need two things: Your instrument and the appropriate
cable or cables to connect it to your Mac. Or, of course, the appropriate cables
to connect it to your audio interface if that’s how your studio works. (See
Chapter 2 if you’re wondering what an audio interface is.)
You can buy an adapter (see Chapter 2) that lets you plug your guitar into
your Mac’s Audio In port for under $20. It’s worth having one around even if
you have an audio interface; that way if you have a problem with the audio
interface, you can just plug your guitar into your Mac instead. It is also great
for recording your guitar, “on the road,” without having to carry additional
devices or boxes or cables or power supplies.
With your instrument plugged into your Mac, follow these steps:
1. Open System Preferences by choosing Apple Menu➪
System Preferences. Click the Sound icon, and then click 
the Input tab.
2. Click the input that your guitar is plugged into.
In Figure 8-1 I’m plugged into the PowerBook’s Line In port.
If your Mac has a built-in microphone, as most Macs do these days,
make sure Internal microphone is not selected before you proceed.
Make sure to select either Line In (if you’re plugging directly into your
Mac) or your audio interface (if your instrument is plugged into an
audio interface). Should you not heed this warning you will hear awful
high-pitched howling known as feedback as soon as you monitor any
Real Instrument track.
Now, you need to establish whether GarageBand “hears,” your
instrument.
155
Chapter 8: Recording Electric Guitars and Other Electronic Instruments

3. Open a GarageBand project by double-clicking it or create a new
project by choosing File➪New or using the shortcut Ô-N.
4. Create a new track by choosing Track➪New Track or using the short-
cut Ô-Option-N.
5. When the New Track dialog box appears, click the Real Instrument tab.
6. Choose an instrument category in the left column.
If you’re playing a guitar, choose the Guitars category; if you’re playing
drums, choose the Drums category; if you’re playing a bass, choose the
Bass category; if you’re playing another type of electronic instrument,
choose the category that sounds most appropriate.
7. Choose a preset for that category in the right column.
Because you just want to ensure that GarageBand can hear what you
play, you can choose any preset for now.
Chapter 7 unravels how these categories and presets work.
8. Set the input to Channel 1.
9. Click the Mono button for Format.
If you want to record two parts onto one track, you can choose Stereo
instead. You can’t tweak individual parts after you record, though,
because the parts won’t be on separate tracks. See Chapter 7 for more
on mono versus stereo.

10. Click the On button for Monitor (so you will hear yourself play).
Your New Track dialog box should look pretty much like Figure 8-2.
11. Click the OK button.
12. Now, strike a chord or play a riff (or do whatever it is you like to
do with your instrument). Did you hear what you played from your
output source (usually your computer speakers)? And, did you see
activity in the track’s level meter or the master level meters?
If you heard your instrument loud and clear and answered with a
resounding “yes,” you’re good to go. Feel free to skip ahead to the
section, “Setting Levels.” If you answered no to either question, see
the next section, “Troubleshooting your setup.”
Troubleshooting your setup
If you followed the steps in the preceding section and the setup didn’t work
quite right, here are some quick fixes (in no particular order):
 Make sure all your cables are connected firmly.
 Make sure the correct devices are selected for input and output in
GarageBand’s Preferences. (Open GarageBand Preferences, click the
Audio/MIDI tab, and choose the appropriate input and output devices
from the Audio Input and Output menus). See Chapter 3 for more details
about preferences.

Chapter 8: Recording Electric Guitars and Other Electronic Instruments

 Make sure the proper track is selected in the main GarageBand window.
 Make sure the mute button for the track you’re recording isn’t illuminated.
If you mute the track you’re recording, you won’t hear yourself play.
 Make sure the solo button for another track is not illuminated.
If you solo any track but the one you’re recording, you won’t hear your-
self play.
 Make sure the volume slider for the track isn’t all the way to the left.
 Make sure the volume control on your guitar is turned up.
 Make sure the audio inputs in System Preferences or on your audio
interface cards are turned up.
 Make sure your Mac speakers aren’t muted (if that’s the output you’re
using). Choose Apple Menu➪System Preferences, click the Sound icon,
and choose the Output tab. If the Mute check box contains a checkmark,
clear it to un-mute your Mac.
 Make sure you can hear other sounds through the selected output
device.
If none of this works, try switching to a different input. If you have an
audio interface available, use it. If it’s an audio interface that’s giving
you trouble, try using your Mac’s Line In port instead.
Making a too soft instrument louder
If you get a signal from the guitar — you can hear it and see activity in its
volume meter — but it’s not loud enough, even with the volume slider slid
all the way to the right, you can do a few different things.
First, make sure the volume knob on your guitar is cranked up all the way.
Plug into an amp or headphone amp temporarily using the same cable to
check. I know I just mentioned this earlier, in the list of things to check, but
I want you to double-check it one more time before I suggest spending money
to resolve it. . . .
If checking the volume doesn’t do the trick, a preamp or an audio interface
can make your instrument louder without adding noise (hissing, buzzing,
crackling, and the like):
 Preamp: If your guitar still doesn’t put out a loud enough signal and
you’ve turned up the input levels everyplace you can, you need a preamp
to boost the signal. I’ve been using the Audio Buddy from M-Audio, shown
in Figure 8-3. A preamp like this can be used with a microphone for vocals,
acoustic guitar, bass, or with any instrument that requires additional
amplification to deliver a sufficient signal to GarageBand.
158
Part II: Laying Down Tracks 

In addition to 1⁄4-inch guitar inputs, the Audio Buddy preamp has XLR
ports and supplies phantom power to microphones connected via XLR
if they require it. It’s quiet (meaning it doesn’t add noise of its own), but
can give a boost to many instruments and microphones for under $100.
 USB audio interface: The audio interface is the better way to spend
your money. Most of them include preamps and phantom power and
an audio interface may sound better than a preamp (if it records at
a higher sample rate than the Mac’s built-in Audio, which is 44.1 kHz 
16-bit samples).
For example, the $149 M-Audio Mobile Pre records at a slightly higher
sample rate (48kHz 16-bit), while the $499 M-Audio FireWire 410 records
ultra-high quality 96kHz 24-bit samples and 192kHz stereo outputs. For
the most part, the better you want your recordings to sound, the more
money you’re going to spend.
Setting the levels
Because you’re recording on a real instrument and not a software instrument,
you won’t be able to change the recording level after a track is laid down. So
if you record the track too hot or too cool, meaning with too much or too little
level, that’s the track you’re stuck with. To ensure you’re making a useable

Chapter 8: Recording Electric Guitars and Other Electronic Instruments

track, remember to check your levels before you begin recording. You do this
by playing a bit of the song you want to record and watching the LEDs next to
the track.
What should you look for? Take a gander at Figure 8-4 for the answer.
You want to set the recording level so you see as much green as possible
without seeing much or any yellow or red. An occasional spike to near the
red, as shown in the third picture down in Figure 8-4, is fine as long as there
aren’t too many and they don’t last too long.
If you see all the red LEDs lit up at once, as shown in the bottom picture in
Figure 8-4, your recording will almost certainly be distorted and is likely to
be unusable. So don’t do that, okay?
For more on checking and adjusting levels before you record, see Chapter 4.
That’s pretty much it. Just remember this mantra when you record guitars
(or anything else, for that matter):
Lots of green and it’s sweet and clean.
Too much red and your track is dead.
Recording the track
There’s really not much to it once GarageBand hears your guitar and you’ve
set the levels. Because you’ve already created the track, all that’s left to do
now is to turn on the Metronome and Count In features if you like them and
then record. (See Chapter 6 for the specific steps.)

160
Part II: Laying Down Tracks 

Even if you checked the levels before recording, you still need to pay careful
attention to the levels while you record, too.
If only one or two brief passages were recorded too hot or cool (as opposed
to a track that’s too hot or cool from start to finish), you can try lowering the
level of the hotter or cooler passages using the rubber band Track Volume
controller. (See Chapter 4 for details.) If there’s not too much distortion in the
recording (from being too hot) and you have other tracks playing simultane-
ously, you can often make it good enough to get buy. Still, it’s better to record
at a proper level in the first place.
So let your ears be your guide — if it sounds good, it’s a keeper and if it doesn’t
sound good, re-record it.
Recording Live with an Amplifier
and Microphone(s)
As I mention earlier in this chapter, recording an electric guitar (or other elec-
tronic instrument) live means that you hook your guitar up to the traditional
guitar amp and record with a mic, rather than plug your guitar directly into
your Mac and use GarageBand’s amp simulators.
The key to recording an amplified electric guitar well is patience. You need
to experiment with mic positions, amp positions, microphones, rooms, and
surfaces before you begin to understand how to achieve just the sound you
want. If you think you’re just going to plug in a mic, hang it near an amplifier,
and get a great guitar sound, you’ve got another think coming ’cause it ain’t
that easy. But if you’re not averse to a bit of work, the results can be out-
standing, just like Jimmy Page or Eric Clapton (well, almost).
All the details in Chapter 7 apply to recording an amplified electric guitar with
a microphone, so here are a few additional tricks and tips that will help you
capture the sound you desire as it leaves the amplifier.
 Mic placement is key. You need to experiment and find the best location
for the mic you’re using. There is no “right” way; you have to find the
sweet spot for your combination of microphone, guitar, and amp. Start
off with the mic about an inch from one of the amp’s speaker cones.
Move it off-axis, to the left and right. Swivel it at different angles. Move
it away from the speaker cabinet in small increments. If your amp has
an open back design, try micing the back of the cabinet instead of the
front. Move the mic around as before.
161
Chapter 8: Recording Electric Guitars and Other Electronic Instruments

Microphone stands are a must in situations like this where precise posi-
tioning of the mic is necessary.
 Loud isn’t always good. If you’re trying to get an overdriven or distorted
guitar sound, set the levels of your amp and guitar as low as you can and
still achieve the effect you desire. Playing louder will just muddy the
recording (that is, make it sound distorted and buzzy). This may be the
effect you’re looking for, but you’ll usually get a better recording if you
play at the lowest level you can.
 A small practice amp is often better than a big old Marshall double
stack for home recording. If you have both, try your little amp — you’ll
be surprised at how nice it sounds when recorded.
 Consider room acoustics. If you’re going for that reverb/echo/distortion
sound, a lively room with many hard surfaces will add natural echo and
reverb. Or, for a more jazz-like passage, you might prefer that the room
add as little color as possible, with soft surfaces to absorb reflected
sound waves before they leak back into the mic.
Many engineers like to record guitar amps in the bathroom. All you need
is a long mic cord and a long guitar cable to do it, and the effect is inter-
esting, to say the least.
If you play too loud, you’ll end up with echo-and-reverb-laden mud instead
of a sweet rock and roll guitar sound.
Try this experiment: Record something three times with the amp set
to three different levels — quieter than usual, normal, and louder than
heck. You’ll find that the louder than heck version rarely sounds as good
as either of the others.
If you try the bathroom trick, remember to experiment with mic position.
It’s a time-consuming chore but worth it if you want the best sound. I’ve
heard more than one recording engineer say that setting up guitar mics
(or drum mics) properly often takes longer than the recording session
itself.
Conversely, if you’re getting too much room sound in the track, try using
pillows or blankets in front of the amp to reduce reflected sound. Move
the amp around the room, too, and point it in different directions if you
think that will help.
Finally, if you’re trying to record an acoustic guitar, you may have more luck
with an electrified acoustic guitar, such as the J.R. Beck 9861EQ acoustic/
electric guitar shown in Figure 8-5.
162
Part II: Laying Down Tracks

It’s a standard acoustic guitar with three additions: a pickup, inside (think
little baby microphone), a hole to plug a guitar cable into, and a 4-band equal-
izer and volume controller. It plays and sounds like an acoustic guitar, but
you can plug it into an amplifier, audio interface, or Mac, and record it with-
out a microphone.
I can’t tell you how much easier it is to record my 9861 than it is to mic my
older Yamaha acoustic and record it with a microphone. Also, the sound 
is much better, with a lot less unwanted noise and other crud than when 
I record acoustic guitar with a mic.
If you plan to record a lot of acoustic guitar tracks, an electric/acoustic will
save you hours of setup and microphone placement/adjusting time. It will
almost certainly sound better as well.

J.R. Beck is a relatively new guitar company that uses the so-called Dell
model to offer great guitars at amazingly low prices that are only available
on the Web (www.jrbeck.com). The 9861 in Figure 8-5, for example, costs
around $200 but plays and sounds better than electric/acoustics costing
twice as much.
Customizing the Sound of
Your Guitar Tracks
Now that your guitar track is in the can, there are many things you can do to
it to make it sound . . . well, different, if not better.
Changing the presets and amp simulators
The first and easiest is to choose a different amp model. Open the Track Info
window (Track➪Show/Hide Track Info; Ô-I; or double-click the track name)
and select a different amp model in the right column.
If you’re looking for an unusual sound, try some of the other instrument
models on your guitar. Bass, vocal, drum, or even band instrument presets
may sound perfect laid on your guitar track. Don’t be afraid to try it; it won’t
hurt, and you can always Undo if you don’t like it.
The first thing I’d try is changing the amp simulation effect by choosing one
of the five presets as shown in Figure 8-6. When you do you’ll hear an entirely
different guitar sound than before.
Editing the presets
If you still haven’t found the sound you want among the amp and instrument
presets, find the one that’s the closest to the sound you desire and edit it to
your specifications. Here’s how:
1. In the Track Info window, click the Edit button (little pencil) next to
the presets menu.
I clicked the Edit button next to Amp Simulation, and the Amp Simulation
window appeared, as shown in Figure 8-7.

165
Chapter 8: Recording Electric Guitars and Other Electronic Instruments

2. Have your way with the Amp Simulation effect’s individual controls.
Don’t forget you can play or record while the Track Info window is open.
So it’s easy to listen to a bunch of different sounds for your instrument
before recording.
3. Don’t forget to save the Amp Simulation preset if you like it (by choos-
ing Make Preset in the Amp Simulation window’s preset menu).
4. And if you like the instrument sound overall, click the Save Instrument
button at the bottom of the Track Info window to save it. Remember to
save the preset under a different name.
When you’re asked to name a preset or instrument, choose a name
other than the instrument or preset’s original name. If you use the orig-
inal name when you save, you replace the Apple-configured version
with the one you just created, which is almost certainly not what you
want.
When you exhaust the possibilities of the Amp Simulation, consider changing
the settings of other effects, or enabling or disabling effects to change what
you hear even further.
Making other changes
When you’re satisfied with the sound of your guitar track, here are some
more tricks to try:
 Double tracking: Double-tracking is an age-old technique to fatten up
the sound of a guitar. See Chapter 10 for details.
 Finding additional amp models: Apple’s GarageBand Jam Pack more
than doubles the number of amp models and offers several additional
amp simulation presets as well, as shown in Figure 8-8. For $99, you also
get over two thousand new loops, more than a hundred new software
instruments, and more than a hundred new effects presets. If you’re
having fun with GarageBand, Jam Pack is a bargain.
If you’ve got Jam Pack and you’re still not satisfied, AmpliTube is the
plug-in that the pros use. Its assortment of amps, speakers, preamps,
stomp box effects, and presets is endless. Even a mediocre guitar
sounds great when you play it through AmpliTube.
See Chapter 15 for more about Jam Pack and AmpliTube.

Finishing 
Your Song

In this part . . .
W
hen your tracks are in the can, it’s time to polish
and share them with others. In Chapter 9, I look at
the various ways that you can edit and tweak your tracks
to make the good parts sound better and the bad parts, er,
not sound at all. After you’ve cleaned up any mistakes or
underwhelming performances, it’s time to mix the tracks
into a cohesive song, which, not coincidentally, is the topic
of Chapter 10. Finally, in Chapter 11, you put the icing on
the cake by mastering, that is, exporting the tracks to
iTunes as a single dynamic-sounding stereo song file.

Chapter 9
Editing and Polishing Tracks
In This Chapter
 Figuring out when to edit tracks
 Understanding the differences between software and real instrument tracks
when you edit
 Fixing mistakes
 Rearranging regions
 Sweetening
T
his chapter covers the details of editing tracks, which is your last sanity
check before you mix and master your song. Here, I ask you to think about
editing, arranging, and sweetening your song — all the things that you do to
give it that little something extra that makes some songs more special than
others.
First, I explain some basics: the best time to edit and the important differences
between editing software instrument and real instrument tracks. Then, I cover
easy ways to fix mistakes without recording the whole track over. You’ll also
find all-purpose editing techniques that can be used to improve an imperfect
track as well as things that you may (or may not) want to add to the song
before you mix.
Before you jump into editing, if you plan to do heavy experimentation on a
song, save a copy of it before you begin by choosing File➪Save As. Then, if
your experiment goes awry, you can always go back to the way the song was,
even if you’ve saved again and again while you experimented.
“When Should I Edit Tracks?”
The acts of editing and sweetening aren’t time sensitive and can take place at
almost any point in production or postproduction. In other words, you don’t
have to wait until the tracks are in the can to edit, arrange, or sweeten them.

You can do anything any time you like. I prefer to do my editing, arranging,
and sweetening after all (or most) of the tracks are in the can, but there is
no right or wrong way.
It’s okay to edit or sweeten at any point in the process, but you should try
to do all the editing and sweetening before you mix and master. If you edit
or sweeten a song after you mix and master it, you’ll have to go through at
least one more cycle of remixing and remastering. Because remixing and
remastering can be a huge time sucker, I try to avoid these tasks whenever
possible by doing all my editing and sweetening (or what I think is all of it)
before I even begin a rough mix.
Editing Software versus
Real Instrument Tracks
Not too surprisingly, software instruments offer you the greatest control
when it comes to changing almost anything, including individual notes.
That’s because, as you’ve heard before, when you play a note on a MIDI
keyboard (or other MIDI controller) it sends information about the note
you played to GarageBand. So, because software instrument tracks contain
information rather than recorded sound (which is what real instrument
tracks contain), you can do things to them you can’t do to a real instru-
ment recording such as change the intensity, pitch, duration, and sustain
of a note or notes, or change the song’s tempo — a little or a lot — without
sacrificing sound quality. You can’t do those things to real instrument tracks.
When editing software or MIDI instruments, you have all sorts of options.
Here are just a few examples:
 Change the tempo. If you feel the song is too fast or too slow, you can
change the tempo a little or a lot and your software instrument tracks
will adapt to the new tempo instantly and sound wonderful most of the
time.
 Change the pitch. If you attempt to sing the song but can’t reach the
highest notes, you can transpose the song into a lower key as long as
it doesn’t yet contain real instrument tracks.
Real instrument tracks can’t have their pitch shifted in GarageBand,
though it is possible using third-party plug-ins for GarageBand or a
higher-end audio program such as Logic Pro or Pro Tools.
172
Part III: Post-Production: Finishing Your Song 

 Rearrange the notes. You can get away with some pretty drastic edits
in a software instrument track. For example, moving a note to the left or
right changes when it is played, and moving a note up or down changes
which note (or, in the case of some instruments including drums, which
instrument) is played. You can change the duration of a note by grabbing
either edge and dragging to extend or shorten it. To duplicate a note (or
notes), select it and then Option-drag it to another location in the Editor’s
Timeline.
I explain all the details of editing tempo, pitch, and individual notes in the
section, “Editing Software Instrument Tracks,” later in this chapter.
You have less control over fixing boo-boos in a real instrument (which includes
vocal tracks), but although you can’t change sour notes or make them play
longer, you still have options.
You can do what the pros call a punch in or punch out. A punch in or punch
out is the act of recording over a section of a track that you have already
recorded, without touching the rest of the track. So, if you have a mistake
in your bass line, guitar line, or even your vocals, you can punch in over
the mistake and fix it.
I made it sound easy to punch in, but in truth, it’s often very hard to do this
properly. Whenever you have a recorded session and you try and replace
part of that session, ambient noises are likely to be different, in the case of
analog instruments, or you may have a particular room sound on the track
that would make replacing part of it difficult or impossible. If you have a mis-
take of that magnitude, you may just have to re-record the whole track.
Fixing Flubs and Faux Pas
GarageBand lets you disguise and fix mistakes in tracks in a number of differ-
ent ways. I am a terrible musician and a worse singer, so fixing and disguising
mistakes after the fact is almost always faster and easier than re-recording
the whole track, at least for me. So the next time you lay down a track that’s
almost perfect, or find a flaw that you hadn’t noticed before in a track, don’t
delete the track until you’ve tried some of or all the following techniques.
Every so often a track has problems that can’t be fixed or disguised. In the
beginning, you won’t know until you try, so try some of the techniques dis-
cussed in this chapter before you press Delete. After a while, you’ll have a
sixth sense: You’ll know whether a mistake is fixable the moment that you
make it.

Chapter 9: Editing and Polishing Tracks

Punching in and out to replace
part of a track
If you make a mistake when you record a track, you can sometimes fix the
mistake by re-recording the part with the mistake. In recording parlance,
this is called punching in and punching out.
In the olden days, punching in and out was an exotic thing that was only
done in the best studios using the highest of high-end audio gear. If you
were recording at home, your gear was too noisy to get away with punching
in much if at all. So if there was a mistake in a track, you either masked it as
best you could with the available tools or re-recorded it. As time marched
onward, the technique trickled down to consumer recording equipment;
today, punching in and out has become a checklist item, available in almost
every audio program available today.
Technically speaking, punching in using GarageBand is as easy as it can be;
doing it well enough to fool your ears is what is challenging.
When you punch in and out in GarageBand, you choose which part you 
re-record by using the Cycle Region.
When the Cycle Region is turned on, the playhead loops back to the begin-
ning of the Cycle Region every time it reaches the end. So the region plays
(or records) continually until you click the Stop button or press the spacebar.
To punch in and out on a track, follow these steps:
1. With your song open, click the Cycle button (the one with the curved
arrows) or press C to activate the Cycle Region.
A yellow ruler appears under the beat ruler showing the Cycle Region,
as shown in Figure 9-1.
The first time you use the Cycle Region, it appears at the far left end of
the beat ruler, but if you move it, the Cycle Region appears where you
moved it the next time you turn it on.
2. Select the track that needs fixing.
3. Find the precise part that you want to re-record by moving the play-
head and listening to the track.
4. Position the Cycle Region over the part that you want to re-record.
Click and drag the middle of the yellow Cycle Region to move it; click
and drag on either end to extend or shrink it.
174
Part III: Post-Production: Finishing Your Song 

Use the Zoom slider to zoom in on the timeline if you need to.
Click Play or press the spacebar to play the contents of the Cycle
Region. If it’s the exact part you want to re-record, proceed to Step 5.
If it’s not, continue to move, expand, and/or contract the Cycle Region
until it contains only the precise portion of the track you wish to 
re-record, and then proceed to Step 5.
It’s almost impossible to perform a decent punch in without using
GarageBand’s Count In feature. Choose Control➪Count In and 
select it. Count In is a toggle: It’s on when there is a check mark next to its
name in the menu.
5. Click the Record button (the red dot button) or press R to start
recording.
6. Play the part.
If the track is a real instrument, only the first pass through the cycle
region is recorded as you play. If you don’t stop recording after your
first pass, the second pass (and every subsequent pass) plays back
what was recorded on the first pass.
But if the track is a software instrument, something different and very
useful happens instead: Every pass is recorded and merged with the pre-
vious passes. So, for example, you can play snare drum on the first pass,
the high-hat on the second pass, and the ride cymbal on the third pass.
When you click the Stop button or press the spacebar, all three passes
have been recorded on the same track. Neat, eh?
The Cycle Region appears in yellow.

7. When you are finished playing the part, click the Play button or press
the spacebar to stop recording.
Now listen to the track closely and if it’s not what you want, try again.
When you’re finished with this punch-in, don’t forget to click the Cycle
button or press C to turn off the Cycle Region.
Just undo it . . . and then redo it
With GarageBand, it’s easy to undo many mistakes immediately. You can
undo the last thing that you did. But did you know that you can undo the
next-to-last thing you did, and the thing before that one, and the thing
before that, and so on?
The first time you use the Undo feature, it reverses the last change that you
made. But tell GarageBand to undo a second time, and it undoes the action
before that. You can continue to use Undo as needed.
Here’s a quick list of undo and redo commands:
 To undo the previous action: Choose Edit➪Undo or press Ô-Z.
 To redo what you just undid: Choose Edit➪Redo or press Ô-Shift-Z;
what you undid will be redone.
 To get the ultimate undo: Choose File➪Revert to Saved, and your song
goes back to the way it was the last time you saved it.
The Undo and Redo features are linear, so pay close attention. It’s easy to
undo something good — something that you didn’t want to have undone — 
if you just keep pressing the shortcut without watching what happens each
time. Instead of relying too heavily on the Undo and Redo features, save a
copy of your song before you begin undoing or redoing by choosing File➪
Save As.
Splitting and joining tracks
You can take any region on any track and divide it into two or more parts.
This has many practical uses, but the one that you’ll probably use most is
deleting part of a region.
From a cough to a botched note, splitting a region is the most direct, easi-
est, and often the best way to edit out a part of a track that you no longer
need.
176
Part III: Post-Production: Finishing Your Song 

If you trim out “dead space” in live instrument tracks, your songs will have
a brighter, cleaner sound. For example, if you start recording 12 seconds
before the first note the guitar plays, you should trim out the 12 seconds of
dead space before the guitar kicks in. The same thing goes for vocals — if
you recorded air, trim it out. That dead space has noise in it. Deleting the
dead space lowers the overall noise level for your song, so if you want the
cleanest, brightest mix possible, delete dead space on any real instrument
track if it’s longer than 2–3 seconds. It’s a big hassle, but your song will
sound better for your trouble.
To split a region, follow these steps:
1. To split a single region, click it once to select it; to select multiple
regions, Shift-click or drag to select them all.
2. Move the playhead to the precise point where you want the split to
occur.
3. Choose Edit➪Split or press Ô-T.
The region will split into two regions at the playhead, as shown in 
Figure 9-2. Go ahead and try it out. I have all the time in the world.
You can split a region into as many regions as you want. If you’re cutting out
part of a track, you may need to add a second split to isolate the section that
you want to delete. After you do that, select the section of the track that needs
to go and delete it by pressing Backspace or Delete.
Silencing mistakes with the Track Volume
rubber band
Some tracks just can’t be fixed. But even if nothing else so far in this chapter
has helped, you can try using one more tool: the Track Volume rubber band.
Basically, you make the mistake fade out gradually so that no one knows that
the mistake was ever there.

Chapter 9: Editing and Polishing Tracks

Here’s how to use the Track Volume rubber band to erase a mistake:
1. Select the track that you want to adjust.
2. Make the Track Volume check box appear by clicking the little triangu-
lar Reveal Track Volume button under the track’s name in the Tracks
column.
3. Click the Track Volume check box so a check mark appears.
The track volume rubber band control is now enabled.
4. At the point where you want to begin fading out the mistake, click on
the rubber band to create a control point.
It’s best to start fading out before the mistake actually happens. If you
fade out too quickly, it sounds goofy.
5. Click near the beginning of the mistake, near the end of the mistake,
and a few beats after the end of the mistake to create three more con-
trol points.
6. Drag the two control points in the middle downwards to reduce or
eliminate the sound during that portion of the track, as shown in
Figure 9-3.
To find the exact location where you want to begin fading out and back
in, move the playhead back and forth and click the Play button or press
the spacebar to listen. When you find the location of the mistake, begin
your fade out a few beats before the mistake occurs and begin to fade
back in a little before the mistake ends.
Click triangle to show Track Volume check box.

Part III: Post-Production: Finishing Your Song 

This trick won’t work every time, but if your song has enough other stuff
going on, you can usually fade a mistake right out of the mix this way with-
out anyone but you noticing.
Moving Regions
It’s important to remember that with digital recording, you can easily move
anything to anywhere. You can take any region and drag it anywhere on the
Timeline, even to an entirely different track.
For example, perhaps you decide that the intro you recorded for a song would
really make a much better ending. Just split all the tracks at the end of the intro
(the start of the fifth measure in Figure 9-4). Then select the intro regions and
drag them to the tail of the song, as shown in Figure 9-4.
You can move real and software regions anywhere on the Timeline with just
one proviso: Software instrument regions can only go on a software instrument
track, and real instrument regions can only go on a real instrument track.
Editing Software Instrument Tracks
Software instrument (green) tracks offer the greatest flexibility for editing.
You can, of course, choose a different instrument, but you can also change
the pitch or tempo (and not just by a little), without ill effect. You can’t do
Figure 9-4:

179
Chapter 9: Editing and Polishing Tracks

those things to real instruments. If you alter their tempo or pitch very much,
they’ll sound unnatural — or worse.
I recommend laying down software instrument tracks first, before you begin
recording real instrument tracks. If you decide that the tempo is too slow or
too fast, or the pitch is too high or low, you can make the appropriate changes
to software instrument tracks without re-recording the tracks. But if you record
real instrument tracks first and then decide that a song is too slow, fast, high,
or low, you have to re-record all those real instrument tracks.
Changing the tempo
GarageBand lets you change the tempo of an entire song but not the tempo of
an individual track. If you change the tempo of one track, you have to change
the tempo of all the tracks.
If that’s what you want to do — change the tempo of the song — click the
Tempo readout on the digital display, as shown in Figure 9-5, and then use
the slider to adjust your tempo. Slide it upward to increase the tempo and
downward to decrease it.
Changing the pitch
If you can’t sing the highest notes, or, as often happens to me, you can play the
part more easily in a different key, you can change the pitch of any software
instrument track at any time and it won’t affect the rest of your tracks. But as
I mentioned earlier in this chapter, changing pitch only works with software
instrument tracks.

180
Part III: Post-Production: Finishing Your Song 

If you want to change the key of the whole song, you’ll have to do the follow-
ing for each instrument (except drums and percussion instruments).
Here’s how to change the pitch of a software instrument track:
1. Double-click the region you wish to change the pitch of or single click
to select it and then click the Track Editor button.
The Track Editor button appears in the lower-left corner of the timeline
window; it looks like a tiny scissors cutting a little audio waveform.
2. In the Advanced panel, move the Transpose slider to the left or right
to make the pitch of your loop rise or fall.
The number that is changing is the number of half steps from the origi-
nal pitch. You can also type the number into the box above the slider.
You may want to change the pitch by a little or a lot, depending upon
your intent. If you can’t quite hit the highest note in a song, dropping
the song’s pitch by one, two, or three half steps ought to do the trick.
I often make my software instrument tracks sound different by transpos-
ing them up or down a full octave, which is 12 half steps. Sometimes when
I double-track an instrument, I’ll transpose one of the tracks up or down
an octave for a fuller sound. An added benefit of transposing by a factor
of 12 is that you don’t have to change the pitch of any other instrument
tracks.
Figure 9-6 shows the Transpose slider, with the default setting of 0 on
the left and transposed up 5 half-steps on the right.
Figure 9-6:
You can
change the

moving the

slider to the

left, or by

in the

field.
181
Chapter 9: Editing and Polishing Tracks

3. Listen to the track by clicking the Play button or pressing the space-
bar on your keyboard.
4. Adjust the Transpose setting some more if necessary.
5. (Optional) Click the Track Editor button again to hide the Track Editor
portion of the timeline window.
Be careful if you change the pitch of just one loop or track. The new pitch
needs to be in the same key as other loops and tracks, or it will sound icky.
Without getting into a bunch of musical theory that is beyond the scope of
this book (plus, I couldn’t explain it to you, anyway), just remember to listen
and confirm that everything sounds right after you adjust the pitch (or adjust
most things, for that matter).
Rearranging notes in a track
Now, without further ado, this section shows you how to do fine-tune editing
in a software instrument track by rearranging the notes. Remember, in the
Tracks list, Mixer, and regions in the Timeline, blue denotes a real instrument
and green denotes a software instrument.
Before undertaking any major surgery on your song, it’s a good idea to save a
copy of the song first by choosing File➪Save As and entering a new name for
the file before clicking the Save button. That way if you screw things up totally,
you can go back to where you were before you made the changes by opening
the original (and un-screwed up) song file.
To edit a software instrument track, follow these steps:
1. Double-click in the region that you want to edit, or single-click to
select the region and click the Track Editor button.
The Track Editor button appears in the lower-left corner of the timeline
window; it looks like a tiny scissors cutting a little audio waveform.
I chose the Classic Rock Organ software instrument in the Organ category.
When I record, a series of dashes on a graph paper–like grid appears in
the Track Editor.
Those dashes are the notes in your track. GarageBand displays notes
in sort of a digital mode, as opposed to the traditional system, which
uses a staff and note symbols. The dashes of various lengths that are
displayed in a green track are the notes, and each horizontal line in that
graph represents a different note on the musical scale and/or instru-
ment, depending on the software instrument.
If you don’t see the dashes after you record, use the scroll bar to scroll
up and down until you find them, or click either of the magic spots, as
shown in Figure 9-7.
182
Part III: Post-Production: Finishing Your Song 

2. To expand the Track Editor, hover the cursor over either of the magic
spots shown in Figure 9-7. When the cursor turns into a hand, you’re
over the right spot and can drag upward.
After you drag upward, you see the expanded Track Editor, as shown in
Figure 9-8.

Chapter 9: Editing and Polishing Tracks

3. To change the grid scale (the spacing of the vertical lines), click the
Ruler icon in the upper-right corner of the Track Editor and select
the beat structure that you want. (See Figure 9-9.)
4. Change the zoom in the Track Editor so that you can see the notes that
you want to edit.
The Track Editor has its own zoom-control slider in the lower-left corner
of the GarageBand window. It works just like the Timeline zoom control —
slide it to the right and you zoom in on the notes in the Editor. You see
fewer notes but have finer control over the individual notes that you do
see. Conversely, slide it to the right and you zoom out. This lets you see
more notes at once, but they’re smaller and harder to drag around, as
shown in Figure 9-10.
Notice that the size of each dash grows when you zoom in and that the
top picture shows nine measures of MIDI information (that’s what the
dashes represent). The middle picture shows two measures’ worth, and
the bottom picture shows less than one measure.
You may have recorded many different notes, so you may need to scroll
up and down in the Track Editor to see them all.

5. To edit the notes in the Track Editor, click one of the dashes to select
it. Do you hear that? When you click a dash, you are “playing” the note
that it represents. To select multiple notes, either click them while hold-
ing down the Shift key or drag a selection marquee around them. With
the note or notes selected, you can start making changes.
Here’s a quick list of the edits that you can make to the notes:
• To move a note or notes: Slide the note to the right or the left on
the same horizontal line, and you change when it is played. Slide
the note up or down to a different horizontal line and you change
the pitch of the note. It’s that simple! When you move a dash, you
change when the note is played, the pitch of the note, or both.
• To change the length of a note: Click the note that you want to
change; then grab the right edge and drag it to the right or the left.
Dragging the edge to the right lengthens the note, and dragging it
to the left shortens the note.
• To duplicate a note: Option-drag the note to another spot on
the grid. You can do the same thing with multiple notes by Shift-
clicking or dragging a selection rectangle around as many dashes
as you wish.
• To delete a note: Select the note (single-click it) and press Delete
(or Backspace). Again, you can select multiple notes and delete
them the same way.
6. To create new notes without touching the keyboard (the music key-
board, that is), press Ô. Your cursor turns into a little pencil. (See
Figure 9-11.) When you click anywhere in the Track Editor grid, a
new note appears.
As always, listen to your changes by clicking the Play button or pressing
the spacebar on your keyboard. If you’re satisfied, you can close the
Track Editor by clicking the Track Editor button. If you’re sure you’re
satisfied, save your changes by choosing File➪Save.
You can also see a Fix Timing button in the region section of the Track Editor.
Clicking this button moves all notes in the track to the nearest beat in the
grid. This can be a great way to do a quick-and-dirty fix on your track. For
example, if you have a drum track that has some beats that aren’t right in
time, clicking the Fix Timing button should fix all the beats that were off.
Listen to the track, and if the results weren’t what you expected, choose
Edit➪Undo or use the shortcut Ô-Z, choose a different value from the Ruler
menu, and try Fix Timing again. Repeat the process until you’re satisfied.
The grid scale affects the amount of correction applied if you click the Fix
Timing button. Notice that it correlates with the choice in the ruler menu
(refer to Figure 9-9). The closer the grid lines, the smaller the “fix” increments.
So if you choose Fix Timing with the scale set to 1/1 Note, it will move the
note a lot farther to fix it than if you Fix Timing with the scale set to 1/32
Note.
186
Part III: Post-Production: Finishing Your Song 

Be careful when using the Fix Timing feature. If you have pickup notes or any-
thing funky or off-beat, you may completely mess up your track by fixing its
timing. If you don’t like the results, undo the fix immediately, lest you lose
your chance by saving or crashing before you do (undo).
Sweetening: To Add New Material?
Or Not?
Now that you have seen how to edit tracks and remove excess gunk, you
should consider one last thing before you’re ready to mix and master: Does
this song need anything else? If it does, that’s called sweetening, which is
otherwise known as adding just one (or two or three) more track(s) during
postproduction.
Why would you want to add something else to your song at this point? If you
wanted it, you would have recorded it already, right? Well, one truism about
producing music is that less is usually more. The fastest way to wreck a per-
fectly good song is to add one more track to it.
That is, unless you actually need that track.
Deciding when to sweeten a track is soooooo very subjective. But I know that
a time will come when you need to add that track to your song, so I want to
give you some food for thought.

Chapter 9: Editing and Polishing Tracks

There’s an old poker maxim that says, “Look for a reason to fold.” It means
that you should not look for reasons to pay more money to stay in the game,
but rather you should look for a reason to stop wasting money on the hand
and lay down your cards. I am going to rejigger that phrase with a musical
twist and tell you that when you’re recording a song, you should look for a
reason to leave it alone. Make it your mantra, and say it along with me now:
Look for a reason to leave it alone.
Okay, now that you have the right frame of mind, you’re ready to look at some
of the times when you may be better off not leaving a track alone and adding
something before you mix.
Many songs that were recorded during the last several decades have been
comprised of one or two guitars, drums, a bass, some keyboards, a lead
vocal, and maybe background singers. But many more hit songs had all that
plus one other memorable thing, such as percussion, backing vocals, special
effects, horn, woodwinds, or strings.
In the sections that follow, I talk about some familiar examples (familiar to
me, at least) of songs with worthwhile extras, and I give you tips for adding
them to your song with GarageBand.
Percussion
Think about The Beatles’ song “I Wanna Hold Your Hand.” What’s the best
part of the song? The handclaps are it for me.
What about the cowbell part in Blue Oyster Cult’s “Don’t Fear the Reaper”?
An entire Saturday Night Live skit is dedicated to that! (I also have a love/hate
relationship with the sound of the cowbell in “Mississippi Queen,” by Leslie
West’s Mountain.)
From maracas to a guiro and from a tambourine to a triangle (can you say,
“Comfortably Numb”), sometimes just a whack or two on a percussion instru-
ment is just what a song needs.
Don’t forget your loops. If you can’t play what you want to hear or you can’t
find the right instrument to play it, try your loops. There’s a loop or part of
a loop for almost every occasion. Chapter 5 is all about loops.
188
Part III: Post-Production: Finishing Your Song 

Backing vocals
Does your song have backing vocals? Does it need them? Are you capable?
A backing vocal can often be the backbone of a song. Heck, in some songs,
I find myself singing along with the backing vocal instead of the lead part.
The chorus of “What I Like About You,” by The Romantics, leaps to mind,
or maybe the oooooohhhhhs in “All My Loving,” by The Beatles.
Many of the songs in your music library probably have compelling backup
vocals.
I wouldn’t presume to tell you how to write music, but I will tell you that the
best way to find that magic is to experiment, so create a new track and sing a
few ooohhhs or la-la-la-la-las along with your song. Or hum. There’s no telling
what may come out. Who knows, the killer counter-melody might come rolling
off your lips.
Greek chorus
Or how about the Greek chorus approach? Edwin Starr had a huge hit in the
’70s with his anthem “War.” The backing vocals are a classic Greek chorus
school of backup vocals.
On paper it would look like this:
War! Huh! Good God, ya’ll!
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing!
Say it again!
But here’s how it’s sung:
Everyone: War! Huh!
Edwin: Good God ya’ll!
Backup singers: What is it good for?
Edwin: Absolutely
Backup singers: Nothing!
Edwin: Say it again!
189
Chapter 9: Editing and Polishing Tracks

It all flows together, and I bet when you sing it, you sing it as if it were one
person singing the whole thing. But if that were the case, it wouldn’t sound
like it does. Most songs wouldn’t work with a back-and-forth Greek chorus
background vocal like that, but you never know.
Harmony vocals
Some parts of the song may beg for a harmony vocal, and the right harmony
track can make a great song out of what was merely a good one.
If you don’t know how to sing harmony, take some vocal classes.
Again, when it comes to harmony, less is more. Using a harmony vocal
throughout your whole song is usually a bad idea (with “Bye Bye Love,”
by The Everly Brothers, being one possible exception). If you think that
your song needs a harmony vocal, try adding it on just the verse, or the
chorus, or even just one verse or chorus.
Special effects
Producers have been adding sound effects to popular music for as long as
people have been listening to music. From the spooky Theremin floating
throughout The Beach Boys’ classic, “Good Vibrations,” to the toll of the
bells in Pink Floyd’s “Time” or the cash register in “Money” — or even the
crying tires and the busting glass in J. Frank Wilson’s “Last Kiss” — the right
sound effect at the right place in the right song can make all the difference
in the world.
On the other hand, a wrongly placed sound can make your serious attempt
sound like a song parody. So once again, look for a reason to leave it alone.
If you feel you must, you can create interesting sounds using many different
software instruments including most of the Synth presets. Or record the
sound to a Real Instrument track using a microphone. The only limit is
your imagination.
Horns, woodwinds, and strings
Once upon a time, it would have cost tens of thousands of dollars to add
horns or strings to a song, but today a full orchestra is at your command,
just a MIDI keyboard away. You can lay down a layer of sophisticated musi-
cal goodness underneath your song — from an upright bass to a string
ensemble.
190
Part III: Post-Production: Finishing Your Song 

This is another example of something that you just need to experiment with to
know whether it’s going to work in a song. So don’t be afraid to try anything.
You never know what will sound totally cool, and you can always delete your
change if it doesn’t.
Unless you know how to arrange a song for woodwinds, horns, or strings,
you may want to keep it simple. In other words, it’s easier to play a single
horn or string part than to build an entire marching band or string ensemble
arrangement.
As awesome as synthesized and sampled horns, woodwinds, and strings are
with modern technology, real musicians still sound better. You just can’t
duplicate the nuances and subtle sounds that live musicians can coax from
their instruments.
Of course, this is GarageBand For Dummies and not Million Dollar Recording
For Dummies, so use those software instruments and don’t worry about it.

Chapter 10
Mixing Tracks into Songs
In This Chapter
 Finding out what mixing is
 Creating a level playing field
 Panning tracks left or right
 Adding effects
T
he tracks are in the can, and you’ve edited, tweaked, and cleaned each
one until it’s the best it can be. Now it’s time to turn your pile of separate
tracks into a song. I’m talking, of course, about mixing it.
What Is Mixing?
When you’ve done all you can do with the individual tracks, it is time to blend
them all together in a way that pleases your ear by mixing multiple tracks
together to create a stereo master track.
Technically, the mixing process works something like this:
1. Set the level of each track so that they blend harmoniously.
2. Set the pan (left/right) of each track to place the instrument (or vocal)
in its place in the imaginary sound field.
3. Add effects, such as echo, reverb, compression, and so on, to the tracks.
Not every track needs effects. In fact, adding too many effects is a
common mistake, particularly when the producer is new to multitrack
recording. Forewarned is forearmed; don’t overdo it. Don’t forget your
mantra: “Look for a reason to leave it alone.”
I mix my songs in the order that I’m presenting the steps — levels, pan, and
then effects. But that’s not an ironclad rule; if you want to add effects before
you set your pan positions, go for it. The point is that three fairly discrete
components make up the mixing process; you need to pay attention to all
three if you want the final song to sound its very best.

When you master your song, you pretty much repeat the mixing process. But
rather than tweaking individual tracks, you set levels, pan, and so on for the
entire song at once.
Take your time mixing your songs. Experiment and try different combinations
of levels, pan, EQ, and effects. The mix is where the magic occurs; I often
spend more time mixing than recording tracks.
Mixing isn’t rocket science — it’s fun and easy, and you don’t need a degree
in musicology or even audio engineering to mix. In fact, all you really need is
your ears. There is no right or wrong mix; the perfect mix is the one that
sounds right to your ears.
To me, mixing is the most creative part of the production or postproduction
process — and the most fun. Mixing is where you add that special something
that makes your song “music” and not just a collection of recorded tracks.
Now relax, get comfortable, and let’s mix.
Creating a Level Playing Field
In general, you’re shooting for a mix where no instrument or voice overpow-
ers the others, and each instrument or vocal can be heard clearly. So, the
first step in mixing is usually to create a rough mix, where you set the level of
each track about where you want it, relative to the other tracks. Then, you
can fine-tune the levels of each track. All the while, keep an eye on the level
meters to make sure that you stay out of the red.
The following sections have all the details.
Roughing it with a rough mix
Before you do anything else — before you touch the pan control or add
effects, you create a rough mix for each track so that no instrument or vocal
track is dominant and all the tracks can be heard clearly. Create your rough
mix by following these steps:
1. Play your song by clicking the Play button or pressing the spacebar,
and then listen closely to the levels.
Is any instrument or vocal far too loud or soft? Are you hearing every
instrument and vocal track?
194
Part III: Post-Production: Finishing Your Song 

2. Adjust the level of each track that seems too soft or too loud by
moving its slider control to the left or right in the Mixer column.
Keep an eye on the master level meter in the lower-right corner of the
Timeline window; it represents the level of your stereo mix. If you make
a track too hot, you’ll probably overload the master level meter and see
some red. It’s better to keep an eye on it now than to have to readjust all
your levels again later in the process to prevent clipping. So watch out
for those red LEDs on the master level meter, and try to keep all your
levels set so that you see little or no red on the masters.
3. Listen to the song again to see how adjusting the level affected the
rough mix. If the levels still aren’t quite right, keep tweaking using the
level sliders.
I usually spend a few minutes adjusting level controls for any tracks that
are too loud or soft. I then listen and adjust any tracks that are still too
loud or soft. When I have a reasonably good balance and nothing is hor-
ribly loud or soft, I move on to the next step, knowing that I can always
make additional adjustments later if necessary.
And that’s all there is to a rough mix, as shown in Figure 10-1.
You can use the Mute and Solo buttons in the Tracks column to enable or dis-
able tracks when you’re working on your rough mix. I usually mute the vocal
tracks until I have a rough mix of the instrument tracks. Then I unmute the
vocal tracks and mix them in. You don’t have to use Mute or Solo when you
mix; they are merely tools that you can use if you so desire.
When you’re satisfied with your rough mix, it’s time to begin mixing in
earnest by fine-tuning your levels, which it what the next section is all about.

Chapter 10: Mixing Tracks into Songs

A fine tune
Now you’ll give your song a more critical listening, this time searching for
parts of tracks that are too loud or too soft. If you’ve got a wonderful vocal
that sounds perfect during the verses but overloads the level meters during
the louder choruses, you can fine-tune the track so that its level is perfect all
the way through.
The Track Volume rubber band is the key. You use it to lower the level of the
vocal during those overly loud choruses so that the whole track plays with-
out seeing red in the meters.
You can also use this technique to emphasize a solo or disguise a flubbed
part.
Figure 10-2 shows a mix that’s been fine-tuned by using the Track Volume
controls on two of the four tracks. The guitar and harmonica are emphasized
during the introduction, after which I reduce their levels a little to blend with
the rhythm section.
In the 15th measure, the harmonica solo begins, so I increased the harmonica
track’s level there to emphasize it. In the 21st measure, the harmonica solo
ends and the guitar solo begins, so I increased the guitar track’s level and
reduced the level of the harmonica track.
I almost always mix drums and bass (the “rhythm section”) first, and I rarely
use the rubber bands for either. The rhythm section usually remains at a con-
stant level throughout the whole song — except when it doesn’t. There are
exceptions to every rule, and while it’s rare that I use Track Volume rubber
bands on a bass part, I do occasionally use them on drum parts to emphasize
or de-emphasize a portion of the track.

Part III: Post-Production: Finishing Your Song 

To use the rubber band for a track, follow these steps:
1. For the track that you want to tweak, click the triangular button on
the right side of the Tracks column.
2. Select the Track Volume check box to enable it.
3. Find the point in your track where you want to raise or lower the level.
To find the right spot, move the playhead and click the Play button or
press the spacebar.
4. Click on the rubber band to create your first control point.
It’s best to start your adjustment a little before the part where you want
the level adjustment to occur.
5. Click again near the beginning of the part, a second time near the end
of the part, and a third time several beats after the end of the part to
create three more control points.
6. Drag the two control points in the middle upward or downward to
increase or decrease the sound for that part.
7. Listen to what you’ve done. If it doesn’t sound smooth and natural, try
dragging the control points around a little — up or down to change
the level, or left or right to change the duration.
Level meters: Red = dead
Each track has a pair of level meters for its left and right channels. Be sure
and pay attention to them as you mix your song. If the level of a track is too
hot (that is, too high), you will introduce distortion and other undesirable
crud to your song — something you should avoid at all costs.
If any track’s level is too hot, you’ll see red on the right side of its level
meters. In a nutshell, no track should be red for more than a quick second,
and it’s better if you see no red at all.
To make things easier, each level meter has a peak indicator, as shown in
Figure 10-3. When a track’s level hits the red zone, the peak indicator lights
up in red and remains lit until you click it to turn it off.
Peak indicators are an easy way to figure out which tracks are too hot with-
out having to watch 20 or 30 level meters at once while the song is playing.
If you see any track’s peak indicator is lit, determine whether the whole track
is too hot or if it’s only too hot in one or two places. If the whole track is too
hot, use the sliding level control to reduce the level; if only one or two places
in the track are too hot, use the Track Volume rubber bands.
197
Chapter 10: Mixing Tracks into Songs

The most important level meters of all, though, are the master level meters in
the lower-right corner. These indicate the level for the left and right channel
of the stereo mix. If they go into the red, you risk ruining the whole song. So
while it’s important to keep individual tracks out of the red, it’s even more
important that the master levels aren’t too hot.
The master levels reflect the combined levels of all the tracks. If your master
levels are hot, reduce the level of one or more tracks. Ideally, you want to see
as much green as possible and little or no red.
Furthermore, if the peak indicators for your master level meters light up,
your song is too hot. Adjust individual track levels until most or all of the red
has been eliminated before you master and export your song, or you’ll hate
the way it sounds.
Panning Tracks Left or Right
When you’re satisfied with your levels, it’s time to look at panning your
tracks. Pan determines how much of each track is sent to the left and right
speaker. The object of panning is to create an imaginary stereo sound field
and to place instruments on the virtual stage. For example, the harmonica
player is on the far right side of the stage, the singer and drummer are smack
dab in the middle, the bass player is just to the right of the drummer, and the
guitarist is on the far left side.
Figure 10-4 shows tracks that are panned to create the illusion that I just
described.

198
Part III: Post-Production: Finishing Your Song 

You can even create the illusion that one instrument is closer to the front of
the stage than others with effects like delay, reverb, and echo. These terms
are covered in the section, “The Effects of Adding Effects,” later in this chapter.
The ear is less sensitive to the direction of low frequencies such as a bass or
kick drum, so bass and drums are often panned dead center. All other instru-
ments and voices, though, should be considered for panning.
One of your other objectives in mixing is to separate different but similar-
sounding instruments so that you can hear that they’re two different instru-
ments. To that end, you should avoid panning instruments in the same
frequency range to the same side. Here’s an example: If your song has guitar
and harmonica tracks (both occupy the midrange), you should pan one to the
left and the other to the right. If you panned them both the same way, they
blend together, and neither will sound as clear and distinct as when they’re
panned to opposite sides.
Pan positions range from “no pan,” or dead center, to all the way to the left or
right, known as panning the track “hard left” or “hard right.” The other posi-
tions are described as if the knob were a clock face. So a track that’s panned
halfway to the right, such as the harmonica track in Figure 10-4, is panned
right to 3 o’clock.
As I said earlier, mixing is not an exact science, but if you’re trying to create a
song that sounds like what you hear on the radio, here are some suggestions
for panning particular instruments and vocal parts:
 Drums: If the drums are a loop and contained on a single track, I pan
them dead center. But if I’ve got separate drum tracks for different drum
parts, I may pan the kick drum and snare dead center and the tom-toms
and cymbals a little off-center, say to 11 o’clock and 1 o’clock.

199
Chapter 10: Mixing Tracks into Songs

 Bass: Remembering what I said earlier about low frequencies being less
directional, I usually pan the bass dead center or possibly slightly off-
center (no farther than 11 o’clock or 1 o’clock).
 Guitar: There’s no hard and fast rule here; I sometimes pan the lead guitar
hard left or right and the rhythm guitar hard to the opposite side. Other
times, I pan the lead guitar a little to one side and the rhythm guitar a little
to the opposite side — say, 2 o’clock and 10 o’clock.
 Keyboards/organs/pianos/synths: Again, there’s no set rule about where
keyboard instruments sound best in a mix, so they may go left or right or
even center if the drums and bass aren’t completely filling the center of
the mix. If you have guitar parts and keyboard parts, it’s usually best to
pan guitars one way and keyboards the other. In this case, the lead guitar
may be panned left to 2 o’clock, the rhythm guitar panned hard left, and
the keyboard panned somewhere on the opposite side (right).
 Lead vocal: This vocal is usually panned dead center or slightly off-
center. If I double a vocal track, I pan one track slightly left, to about
10:30, and the doubled vocal to the right, at about 1:30.
 Background vocals: I almost always double background vocals and usu-
ally pan one track hard left and the second track hard right. If I want an
even thicker harmony vocal sound, I sometimes add a third instance of
the track panned dead center, but with a lower level than the left and
right ones. This gives a kind of Beach Boy effect to the background
vocals.
Be careful: The middle of the sound field gets mighty crowded in most
songs, so adding more tracks panned dead center can muddy the mix
rather than make it clearer.
 Hand-held percussion (tambourine, shakers, washboards, and so on):
Pan it anywhere you think it sounds good. If you’ve got cymbals panned
left or right, you may want to pan the percussion instrument the oppo-
site way.
The bottom line is that there are no absolute rules for setting a track’s pan.
Let these suggestions be your guide, but remember that for every suggestion,
there is an equal and opposite suggestion. If you pan each track where it
sounds best to you, regardless of what anyone (including me) suggests, your
songs will come out sounding just fine.
The Effects of Adding Effects
This is a tough one for me because using effects in the studio could be the
subject of a book that’s even bigger than this one and still not cover every-
thing there is to know. You just have so many different effects to choose from
and so many different uses for effects in your songs.
200
Part III: Post-Production: Finishing Your Song 

So the best I can hope for at this point is to offer you a quick glimpse of a few
of the effects that you’ll likely be using the most.
There’s nothing mysterious or technical about how to use effects on your
tracks — you basically turn the effect on, twiddle with the settings, listen to
the track, and decide whether the effect helps or hurts the song.
I’ll say it one more time: “Just trust your ears.”
Turn on an effect and listen to the difference. Tweak its settings, and listen 
to what happens. After a while, you’ll know what each effect does and what it
sounds like when applied to a track. It won’t be long before you find yourself
listening to a song on the radio and thinking, “I love the chorus effect on that
guitar.”
To find the effects for a track, choose Track➪Show Track Info or press Ô-Y,
and then click the Details triangle. With the Track Info window open, I’ll get
right to it and look at a few of the effects that come into play (pun intended)
most often.
Equalization? Or not?
Equalization (also known as EQ) lets you control specific frequencies within a
track (or song) and increase or decrease the volume for those frequencies to
impart different sound characteristics to a track. Want to brighten up an
acoustic guitar?
Words aren’t the best way to understand the effect of EQ, so I’ll try a little
experiment:
1. Open GarageBand, and create a new song project.
Your project will already have a software instrument Grand Piano track.
2. Record a few measures of piano using your MIDI keyboard or the
built-in on-screen one (choose Window➪Keyboard or press Ô-K).
3. Turn on the Cycle Region (click the circular arrow or press C), and
stretch it to cover the region that you just recorded so that what you
recorded plays continuously, as if it were a loop.
4. Click the track to select it, open its Track Info window, click the Details
triangle, and then select the Equalizer check box to enable it, as shown
in Figure 10-5.
5. Now press the spacebar or click the Play button to start the music.
Listen to the music once or twice to get a feel for what it sounds like
before you add any EQ.
201
Chapter 10: Mixing Tracks into Songs

6. Click the Edit button (the little pencil on the right side of the
Equalizer Presets pop-up menu) to open the Equalizer window, as
shown in Figure 10-6.
7. Open the Presets menu in the Equalizer window (it says “Manual” in
Figure 10-6), and choose the Flat preset.
Figure 10-6:

Edit button,

Figure 10-5:

202
Part III: Post-Production: Finishing Your Song 

The Flat preset is the equivalent of having no equalization. I am having
you select it now to prepare your ears to hear the difference between
the sound of having no EQ applied and the sound of having other pre-
sets applied.
The piano part should still be playing, but now you’re hearing it with no
equalization.
8. Choose a preset from the Presets menu, watch the slider controls, and
listen to the effect of each preset on the piano’s sound.
Figure 10-7 shows the Flat preset along with five others.
So that’s my best way to help you hear what EQ does to your song.
My advice is to use the presets first and only diddle with the sliders if none 
of the factory-supplied presets work. And, if you like what you hear after 
you drag the sliders, choose Make Preset in the Presets menu to save your
masterpiece.
If you change the sliders and then choose Make Preset, don’t forget to
rename the preset. As shown in Figure 10-8, to do that, choose Make Preset
(left). Then rename the preset in the Make Preset dialog box, and click the
Save button (center). The preset then appears in the menu so that you can
reuse it in the future. If you don’t save the preset under a different name,
you’ll override the settings that came with GarageBand, which are the work
of professional producers.

Pssst . . . Would you like to buy some more effects?
There is one more thing, as the king has been
known to say, and that thing is this: If you want
more effects than those that came with
GarageBand, all you need is cash.
Start with the GarageBand Jam Pack, which pro-
vides more than 2,000 additional Apple Loops,
over 100 new software instruments, more than
100 additional effects and presets, plus 15 new
guitar amp settings. It’s a bargain at $99.
If you’re still in the market for more effects, you’ll
be pleased to know that GarageBand supports
Audio Unit plug-in effects. Better still, if you 
own other audio programs that use older VST
plug-ins, pop for another $99 and get yourself 
the fxpansion VST to Audio Unit Adapter
(www.fxpansion.com). This slick little tool lets 
you run your OS X VST plug-ins in Audio Unit–
compatible programs, including GarageBand!
(VST and Audio Units are common file formats
for audio plug-ins.)
Wow! My favorite plug-in of all time, AmpliTube
(www.amplitube.com), shown in the following
figure, now runs in GarageBand, so I now have
over 1,000 different guitar and amplifier configu-
rations that are based on some of the best
modern and vintage amps and effects of all time.
AmpliTube isn’t cheap at $399 a copy, but if you
play guitar, these are amazing high-quality amp
simulations. They’re so good that Queen’s gui-
tarist (Brian May) raves about it, as does pro-
ducer Steve Levine (The Clash, Beach Boys,
and Culture Club) and lots of other real guitarists
and producers (as opposed to poseurs like
yours truly). Download the free demo, and you’ll
be hooked.
Another great value is Pluggo from Cycling74
(www.cycling74.com), a collection of over
100 Audio Unit plug-ins that costs less than
many individual (professional-quality) plug-ins.
Pluggo includes a variety of synthesizers,
delays, choruses, flanging effects, filters, pitch
effects, distortions, granulations, spectrals, and
other effects, as shown in the following figure.

205
Chapter 10: Mixing Tracks into Songs
But don’t take my word for it. Electronic
Musician magazine, which many consider the
bible for recording and producing audio, had this
to say of Pluggo: “We’ve said it before and we’ll
say it again: If you are serious about doing hard
disk recording on the Macintosh, you must buy
this software.”
I have good news: All of GarageBand’s effects share the interface that you saw
in the Equalizer window. This means that you now know how to use every
effect in GarageBand. (And that means that I don’t have to demonstrate them
again, because you already know how they work.)
The following sections give brief descriptions of several more frequently used
effects.

Echo and reverb
Echo (also known as delay) copies the original sound and plays it back later
in time, with enough of a time lapse to be heard distinctly from the original.
Reverb (short for reverberation) is an effect that re-creates the sound of an
acoustic space by playing back many copies of the original signal, at slightly
varied times and volume levels.
It’s hard to explain when and how to use these effects, so just turn them on,
crank them up, and listen to the results. Some tracks sound much better with
a little echo and/or reverb; other tracks sound better with none. Once again,
trust your ears.
If you don’t use echo or reverb on a track or tracks, you can still apply echo
or reverb to the whole song. But that’s a part of the mastering process, and 
I cover that in Chapter 11.
Figure 10-8:
To save the
settings you
love, save
the preset

ferent name.
206
Part III: Post-Production: Finishing Your Song 

Compressor
The compressor effect decreases the difference between the loudest and the
softest parts of a song or track. Compression adds punch and focus to a song
and can make it sound better when played on a cheap audio system or on the
radio. Many hit songs have a bit of compression applied to compensate for
the limited frequency response of most radio speakers.
If you don’t use the compressor on a track or tracks, you can still apply com-
pression to your whole song. Again, that’s part of the mastering process that
I cover in Chapter 11.
Chorus
The chorus effect plays copies of the original sound later than the original,
with each copy slightly out of tune, so one voice or instrument sounds like
several voices or instruments playing in unison. (Actually, the instruments or
voices play close to in unison, which is not quite in unison.)
Try this effect on vocals or instruments, but only use it a little. It’s a cool and
very professional-sounding effect, as long as you don’t overdo it.
To use the chorus effect, you have to choose it in either of the menus that
appear between the Equalizer and Echo controls in the Track Info window.
Doubling Tracks
Doubling tracks is one of my favorite pro mixing tips. When a track sounds
wimpy, try doubling it to thicken the sound a bit. This means you have two
copies of the same track, which you can create by copying and pasting or by
re-recording the same part on a new track.
The copy and paste method
This technique is fast and easy. Those are its pros. The con is that unless
you’re careful, it will sound mechanical because both tracks are exactly the
same.
207
Chapter 10: Mixing Tracks into Songs

Here’s how the copy and paste method is done:
1. Copy the contents of the track that you want to beef up by clicking the
region and choosing Edit➪Copy or pressing Ô-C.
2. Create a new track by choosing Track➪New Track, by pressing Ô-W,
or by clicking the New Track button.
3. Paste the contents of the original track into the new track by choosing
Edit➪Paste or pressing Ô-V.
Applying a different instrument to the doubled track worked wonders —
it now sounds like a wall of guitars instead of one wimpy one.
But I wasn’t done yet.
4. Make the track even better by first turning off GarageBand’s Grid
(choose Control➪Snap to Grid or press Ô-G). This is a toggle, so I
double-checked the menu for a check mark next to Snap to Grid. I
didn’t find one.
5. With the grid off, slide the Zoom controller to maximum zoom and
move the duplicated guitar part to the right ever so slightly, as shown
in Figure 10-9.
Now my one wimpy guitar sounds like a horde of blazing-hot guitarists.
Perfect!
The re-recording method
Alternatively, you can double the track by creating a new track and recording
the part a second time, playing or singing along with the original track. You
want to repeat your original performance as precisely as you can, but because
you’re only human, the second recording will have small differences from the
original track. 
Although this technique can take you more time, the differences between the
two takes can make this sound better than copying and pasting the same per-
formance. If you’re a consistent-enough player or singer, the minor differ-
ences between the two performances may sound spectacular when played
together.
To achieve a different kind of depth, offset one of the tracks just a bit by turn-
ing off the grid, zooming all the way in on the Timeline, and sliding one of the
tracks slightly to the left or right (refer to Figure 10-9).
208
Part III: Post-Production: Finishing Your Song 

You get a richer, fuller guitar sound if you pan one of the doubled tracks left
and pan the other track right by an equal amount. Try different combinations
of panning and offsetting the doubled tracks until you find the one that’s per-
fect for your song.
Ping-Ponging to Create a Submix 
(And Save Your Processor)
In the old days, only 4, 8, or 16 tracks were available for recording, so you
couldn’t afford 5, 6, 7, or more tracks of drums.
But mixing engineers wanted full control over each individual drum and
cymbal and how they sounded in the song. Alas, this usually meant five, six,
or even seven mics — and five, six, or seven tracks.

209
Chapter 10: Mixing Tracks into Songs

The technique that was used back then was called ping-ponging (or bouncing),
meaning that the mixing engineer would submix the seven drum tracks to give
two (left and right) new drum tracks, which freed five tracks for use elsewhere.
You can record unlimited tracks now in GarageBand, but at some point, your
poor processor will poop out, and you won’t be able to play or record any
more tracks for your project. However, you can use the ping-pong/bounce
technique to free some processing power.
After you ping-pong, you’ll probably have enough horsepower to continue
recording additional tracks.
Neat, eh?
Here’s how I discovered it: I was using the PowerBook (G4 800) to make a song.
I was recording drums on software instrument tracks and percussion instru-
ments on real instrument tracks. Alas, when I got to about seven tracks, the
accursed warning dialog box, shown in Figure 10-10, stopped me in my tracks.
That wasn’t good. I still needed to add guitars, keyboards, vocals, a sax solo,
and some handclaps, but my processor was pooping out with just the seven
drum tracks. How would I ever complete this song on the PowerBook?
The answer was to take that page from the old analog recording days and
bounce the seven tracks down to one (or two). What that means is that I
mixed the seven tracks — all drums and percussion instruments — just the
way I wanted them to sound in the final song, and then I exported them to
iTunes. I saved my GarageBand project under a different name, deleted the
seven drum tracks from the original project file, and replaced them with the
submix that I just exported to iTunes.
That sounded a bit thin to me, so I added a second track with a copy of the
same submix, panned one track slightly to the left and the other track slightly
to the right, and that did the trick — I had a great-sounding drum and percus-
sion track using very little of my processing power.
Figure 10-10:
This is
something

210
Part III: Post-Production: Finishing Your Song 

Did you get all that? I thought not. Let me go through it again, but this time
with illustrations:
1. It all began when I started a song (“PingPong4KingKongg,” in this
example). By the time the first seven tracks were in the can, I noticed
that the playhead indicator had become very red.
Red means that your processor is being pushed nearly to its limit, so 
I wasn’t surprised to see the dreaded dialog box more often.
So I decided to try that old analog trick — ping-ponging (or bouncing)
tracks — to reduce the load on my CPU.
2. I mixed those seven tracks just the way I wanted them to sound in the
final mix.
3. I then exported the mix to iTunes, as shown in Figure 10-11.
4. I saved a copy of the GarageBand project with a descriptive name
(PingPongDrumTrax), in case I ever needed to remix the drums
(choose File➪Save As or press Ô-Shift-S).
5. I imported the song that I just exported by dragging it from iTunes
into GarageBand, as shown in Figure 10-12.
Figure 10-11:

ing the

6. Meanwhile, back at the ranch (that is, the PingPong4KingKongg 
project), I deleted all seven of the old drum tracks.
Figure 10-13 shows how things look at this point.

7. After I gave it a listen, I decided that the drum track needed to be
thicker, so I created a second track.
I held down Option as I dragged the PingPong4KingKongg#2.4 file down
on the Timeline.
The Option key tells GarageBand that you want to copy what you’re
dragging.
So GarageBand copied the region, placing PingPong4KingKongg#2.6 on
the second track.
8. I panned the first track slightly right and the second track slightly left,
as shown in Figure 10-14, and gave it a listen.
9. I added a little echo and reverb (a very little) to both tracks and then
tweaked their EQ just a bit.
The choice of adding reverb and echo was completely instinctive, but
then again, almost everything sounds better with a little echo and
reverb added — at least to my ears.
And I have to tell you, these two tracks sounded as good as (or better
than) the seven tracks that I started with before the ping-pong match.
Best of all, the playhead indicator was pure white, which indicated that
the two real instrument drum tracks used a lot less processing power
than the original seven (mostly processor-hogging software instrument)
tracks.
YAY! Mission accomplished.

Chapter 10: Mixing Tracks into Songs

So there you have it. If you plan your recordings carefully, it’s easy enough to
create submixes like my little drum example that can reduce the load on your
Mac and let you continue working without reducing the number of anything —
notes, tracks, or effects — that you can use.
And that’s a very good thing!
And, if I later decide that the drum part isn’t quite right, I can open that copy
that I saved in Step 4, change the drum parts, and then do the whole thing
again.

To Master Mastering . . .
In This Chapter
 What is mastering?
 Understanding the Master Track
 Adding the final touches
T
here’s no mystery about mastering — you already know how to do it; you
just don’t know that you know yet. You see, mastering is nothing more
than applying familiar effects, such as echo, reverb, and compression, to your
whole song rather than to individual tracks.
Mastering is the final step in the multitrack recording process; it’s the last thing
that you do before you distribute your work and other people hear it. In big-
time major-label music production, mastering is a highly specialized art that’s
performed by a handful of mastering engineers who get paid the big bucks to
master songs in their state-of-the-art mastering studios using the highest-of-
high-quality audio-processing hardware and software.
Fortunately, you don’t have to go to that trouble or expense: GarageBand has
built-in mastering that harnesses the knowledge of a roomful of mastering
engineers.
I’m only half-kidding. While the GarageBand mastering presets are excellent
and can give most people the results that they want and expect most of the
time, if you plan to have your song professionally duplicated in quantity, you
should probably enlist a good mastering engineer. This ensures that what
ends up on the discs that you’re about to pay for sounds exactly the way you
want it to — or, perhaps more importantly, the way that radio programmers
expect it to.
Mastering your masterpiece in GarageBand can be as easy as choosing a
preset. If you’re not sure what your song needs, let that roomful of experi-
enced mastering engineers do the mastering for you, and don’t touch those
dials. Or, if you prefer the hands-on-the-knobs approach, you can tweak indi-
vidual settings until your fingers bleed. Either way, you’re going to end up
with a song that sounds darned good to most people.
So now it’s time to master mastering!

What, Exactly, Is Mastering?
In the simplest of terms, mastering is adjusting the overall tone and level of
the final stereo mix. When you master in GarageBand, you are merely using
effects that you’ve used before on individual tracks — echo, reverb, equaliza-
tion, and compression — on the whole song instead of on a single track.
Mastering is adding effects judiciously to improve overall tonal balance and
dynamic range. A song with too much low-frequency sound is boomy, boxy,
and muddy; a song with too much high-frequency sound is screechy, shrill,
and brittle. Your goal in mastering is balance — refining the overall sound to
make the song smooth and relaxed and professional sounding.
In addition to judiciously adding effects, you can also adjust a song’s dynamic
range — the difference between the loudest and softest parts. Adding com-
pression and other effects can make your song punchy and radio friendly, but
too much can make it sound artificial and icky.
If you’re making an entire CD, mastering accomplishes the following things:
 Determines the order of the songs on the CD
 “Levels” the songs so that all of them play at roughly the same loudness
and so that no song is louder or softer than the others.
Before You Master
Mixing and mastering are different sides of the same coin, so GarageBand
makes it easy to switch back and forth between the mixing and mastering
chores. This is a good thing, because everything you do to the Master Track
affects the mix.
You can always go back and change anything you like in the mix, but it’s best
to have your mixing as close to complete as possible before you master. If
not, you may end up spending more time than necessary.
Before you begin mastering, double-check the following items to ensure that
you’re happy with them:
 The relative loudness (level) of each track
 The tonal characteristics (equalization) of each track
 The spatial positioning (pan) of each track
You do all these things when you mix, which I cover in detail in Chapter 10.
216
Part III: Post-Production: Finishing Your Song 

You should also trim noise or extraneous sound at the head or tail of any or all
tracks (if you haven’t done so already); your final product will sound better
for it. The easiest way to get rid of dead space is to create a split where you
want the song to actually begin and then delete the dead space after it’s split
off from the song. Check out Chapter 9 for details.
Having checked and double-checked your mix, as soon as you’re sure that it’s
as good as it is going to get, it’s time to master it — and (hopefully) make it
sound even better.
The Master Track Is for Mastering Tracks
When you master, you use the same effects and controls that you’ve been
using on tracks, which makes mastering familiar and easy. GarageBand has a
special track, called the Master Track, which is used for mastering. Any set-
tings and effects that you apply to this track affect your whole song.
Here’s an overview of what you can do on the Master Track, where the mas-
tering magic takes place:
 To show or hide the Master Track, choose Track➪Show/Hide Master
Track or press Ô-B.
The Master Track appears at the bottom of the window (and glows
purple when it’s selected).
 To adjust the tonal characteristics and add effects to the whole song,
open the Track Info window for the Master Track by first selecting the
Master Track and then choosing Track➪Show/Hide Track Info.
(Alternatively, you can press Ô-I or double-click the words “Master
Track” in the Tracks column.)
Here you can simply apply a preset and move on, or you can apply and
customize effects. See the next section for more details.
 To change the song’s level or make part of the song louder or softer,
or if you want to add a fade-in or fade-out, use the Master Volume con-
trol rubber band.
This rubber band works just like the ones that you used for individual
tracks.
If you’re going to use the Master Volume rubber band, you should apply
it last.
You find out more about this control in the section, “Setting the Master
Volume,” later in this chapter.
217
Chapter 11: To Master Mastering . . . 

Applying the final presets and effects
Your goal here is to improve the overall sound of the song by adding effects.
All of GarageBand’s presets and effects are in the Master Track info window,
which you can open by selecting the Master Track and then pressing Ô-I or
by double-clicking the words “Master Volume” in the Tracks column.
Using presets
The Master Track has eight preset categories, which appear in the left column
of the Master Track window. Each of these categories has a handful of preset
options in the right column, as shown in Figure 11-1.
Click the different categories and presets in the Master Track window to hear
how they affect your song. (Click the Play button first, of course.) Listen criti-
cally for the perfect blend of instruments and voices that pleases your ear.
Ignore the names of the categories and presets — try them anyway. Just
’cause it’s called “Classical Chamber” doesn’t mean that it won’t sound fabu-
lous when applied to your pop ballad. Try it — you never know what’s going
to sound awesome to your ears.
Figure 11-1:
The Master
Track has
eight cate-
gories, each
with its own
presets.
218
Part III: Post-Production: Finishing Your Song 

If you are in a hurry or don’t have the patience for the “listen, adjust, listen,
adjust, repeat until satisfied” cycles that it usually takes to master a song,
browse through the presets until you find one that you like, and don’t worry
about tweaking the effects. You can add a fade-in or fade-out if you like (see
the section “Setting the Master Volume,” later in this chapter); other than
that, you’re done with your mastering.
Tweaking a preset’s effects
Sometimes you’ll find a preset that sounds almost perfect, but you think 
to yourself, “if only it had. . . .” Well, you can probably add whatever is 
missing by adjusting any or all of the five Master Track effects: Echo, Reverb,
Equalizer, Compressor, and your choice of a fifth effect. You find these effects
in the Details area of the Master Track window.
If you decide to tweak the effects, here are a few points to keep in mind:
 The echo and reverb effects for individual tracks are relative to the echo
and reverb effects in the Master Track. If you turn off the echo or reverb
effects in the Master Track, they are not available to individual tracks.
 If you have a track that’s panned all the way to the left or the right and
apply effects — such as echo, reverb, or compressor — in the Master
Track, some sound from that panned track may still be heard in the
other speaker, because Master Track effects are applied in stereo.
Most instruments and vocals sound better with a little echo, reverb, and 
compression. So even if you added some of these effects to individual tracks
during mixing, try adding a bit more to the whole song here in the Master
Track window.
You can tweak each of the five effects in the Master Track two different ways:
 Choose a different preset from the preset menu to the right of each
effect.
 Click the Edit button (the little pencil) to the right of each effect’s preset
menu, and create custom settings for the effect.
I recommend changing the effect’s preset first. Apple put a lot of time and
effort into providing presets that sound pretty darned good under most con-
ditions. Unless you’re really confident in your ears, stick to the presets and
you’ll never go wrong.
However, if you can’t resist the urge to tweak the sound of your tune even fur-
ther, you can edit any of the five effects by clicking its Edit button (the little
pencil). The controls for Master Track effects are the same as the controls for
other tracks, as shown in Figure 11-2. See Chapters 6, 7, and 8 for details on
using these controls.
219
Chapter 11: To Master Mastering . . . 

Finally, if you’ve tweaked all four built-in effects and still aren’t getting the
sound that you’re looking for, you can try one more thing: adding an extra
effect.
Adding an extra effect to a preset
Notice that an extra effect is available for mastering; it’s in the menu that
says “None” in Figure 11-2. Click the pop-up menu, and you can choose one
additional effect, as shown in Figure 11-3.
Some of these effects, such as Overdrive and Distortion, are totally inappro-
priate for mastering. Be careful if you use the extra effect, because an effect
that sounded great on a guitar track may sound absolutely awful when
applied to the Master Track.
Setting the Master Volume
Last but not least, remember that check box for Master Volume that I men-
tion earlier in the chapter? If you select this check box, a rubber band volume
controller appears beneath the Timeline that lets you adjust the level of the
song over time. It works the same way as the rubber band volume controllers
for individual tracks.
Figure 11-2:
The settings
for Master
Track
effects
should look
familiar to
you by now.
220
Part III: Post-Production: Finishing Your Song 

If your song plays at the same level from start to finish, you don’t have to use
the rubber bands — just use the master level control slider in the lower-right
corner of the Timeline window to set the output level.
The final level of your track should be as high as possible without showing
much (or any) red in either level meter. If that’s the case already, you can
leave the track volume rubber bands alone, unless you want to make a song
fade in or out, or both; a fade-in is shown in Figure 11-4.
The song starts out silent; then you faintly hear crowd noise. Then the crowd
noise gets louder, and when the drumbeat starts, everything is up to full
volume, where it stays until the end of the song.
Changing the volume with the Track Volume rubber band works the same
way in mastering as in mixing, so for details on using the Track Volume
rubber band control, see Chapter 10.
Figure 11-3:

effects if

221
Chapter 11: To Master Mastering . . . 

Before You Call It “Done”
After you’ve set the effects and volume for the Master Track, you should have 
a project that’s nearly done, but before you can call it done, you need to listen
one or two more times. This is because the effects that you apply to the Master
Track can change the dynamics of the mix in ways that you can’t predict.
So now that you’ve applied Master Track effects, give the song another listen
and pay particular attention to instruments or vocals that are too prominent
or too quiet, drums that aren’t crispy or are too crunchy, guitars that sound
muffled or artificial, or anything else that could sound better.
Fix what needs fixing, and then export the final song to iTunes and burn a CD.
This may be the most important part of mastering: Listen to the song in your
car, at your home, in your office, on a boom box, in the shower, and anywhere
else you can. Chapter 12 walks you through the process of creating a CD of
your song.
Figure 11-4:

222
Part III: Post-Production: Finishing Your Song 

Take some notes about your song. For example, “Lead vocal louder during
second verse and chorus,” “Drums too loud in break between chorus and
third verse,” or “Overall mix muddy; can’t hear brass.”
After you have a feel for what’s right and what’s wrong, go back into
GarageBand, remix, remaster, export, and do it again.
When you no longer hear anything that you want to change, your song is
really done.
As soon as you export a song to iTunes, change its name immediately to
something that allows you to discern between versions. Each time I remix
and remaster, I give the song name a suffix (for example, GM-01, GM-02, GM-
mayBfinal). Then, when I’m absolutely, positively, without any question done
with my remixing and remastering, I delete all but the final version of the
song from my iTunes library.

W
hen your song is finished, you can still do more
with it. In Chapter 12, you find out how to burn a
few CDs for your friends and radio station programmers
or burn thousands of CDs that you can sell at a huge profit.
Then, Chapter 13 takes you off into cyberspace, with infor-
mation about putting your song files on the Web as down-
loadable files or as streaming QuickTime audio. Finally, in
Chapter 14, I go Hollywood and look at using your song
compositions in your iMovie and iDVD projects.

In This Chapter
 Exporting your GarageBand songs to iTunes
 Creating the final CD
 Distributing your CDs
I
’m going to go out on a limb here and assume you’d like to share your mar-
velous music with other people. One of the easiest and most professional
ways to share is to burn them an audio CD that they can listen to on almost
any audio CD player ever made for car, home, or pocket.
The Benefits of Burning CDs
If you haven’t already burned CDs on your Mac, you really should become
familiar with the process because it’s useful for more than just GarageBand.
But for the purposes of this chapter, I’m assuming that you want your friends
to hear all these great tunes you are making with GarageBand.
Of course, CDs aren’t the only way to share your songs. You can put songs 
on the Web or send a song file in an e-mail (see Chapter 13 for details). But
because not everyone has a broadband Internet connection to download
your music, handing out CDs to your friends and family is the next best thing.
One of the things I like to do when I am getting close to finishing a song is to
take it for a ride in my car. In addition to the benefit of having no distractions —
such as other people in the house, incoming instant messages and e-mails, or
those bills I have to pay — listening to a song in the car has another benefit,
too. We all grew up listening to music in the car, which is effectively a lifetime
of training. Put that training to use in listening to your music, too.

If you have an iPod and can play it through your car stereo, that’s even better
and quicker than burning a disc, but if not, burn the song on a CD and take 
it for a cruise in your automobile. Just don’t become too enthusiastic while
driving; it’s good to keep at least one eye on the road and one hand on the
steering wheel.
Relax. Don’t worry — CD burning on your Mac is a piece of pie (I don’t like
cake).
Getting Ready to Burn Songs on CDs
Burning a CD of your GarageBand song is fairly straightforward, but it requires
a few steps. First, you need to make sure that you have all the hardware. Then,
you need to check the Cycle Region and export your song to iTunes.
Gathering what you need to burn CDs
To start, here’s a list of what you need:
 Completed song
 iTunes (If you have GarageBand, you have iTunes; they’re both part of
the Apple iLife ’04 package.)
 A blank CD-R (the R stands for recordable)
 CD burner (also known as a CD-R, CR-RW drive, CD recorder, CD-ROM
burner)
If you’re making an audio CD, you must burn it to a CD-R disc. You can use 
any burner: CD-R, CD-RW, Combo drive, or SuperDrive, but the actual disc you
burn must be a CD-R disc — it must not be a CD-RW (re-writable) or DVD —
CD-R discs are the only type of media that will work properly in most audio CD
players.
And that’s all you need — the whole shebang.
Setting the Cycle Region
Although you generally use the Cycle Region to loop a song during recording
or rehearsal, it serves a different purpose during exporting. When you export,
the Cycle Region defines the portion of the song to be exported. So before you
go near the Export pane, make sure that the Cycle Region in your GarageBand
project is either turned off or covers the whole song (or the part of the song
that you want to export).
228
Part IV: Sharing Your Creations with Others 

If you’ve left the Cycle Region turned on and it’s shorter than the full length
of the song, only the short portion is exported, which may not be what you
want (but sometimes it is, as I explain in this section).
When the Cycle Region is turned off, you don’t see the indicator, as shown 
in the top portion of Figure 12-1. When the Cycle Region is on, it appears in
yellow, just below the tempo ruler at the top of the Timeline, as shown in
Figure 12-1. (Because you can’t see the yellow in a grayscale figure, the yellow
area is marked in the figure.)
Using the Cycle Region is a great way to control how much of your song is
exported. Just set the Cycle Region for the portion of the song that you want,
and then export normally. GarageBand exports only the portion of the song
that’s defined by the Cycle Region. The length of the song, number of tracks,
and speed of your Mac’s processor determine how long an export will take,
so if you’re in a hurry and just need part of a song, the Cycle Region can help
you get the job done faster.
Here’s how to tweak the cycle region so that you get the song (or portion of
the song) that you want:
 To toggle the Cycle Region on or off: Click the circular arrow button to
the right of the fast-forward button, or press C.
 To move the whole Cycle Region to the left or right: Click in the middle
of the Cycle Region and drag it, as shown on top in Figure 12-2.
 To extend or shorten the Cycle Region: Click the right or left end of the
Cycle Region, and then drag, as shown in the middle and bottom of
Figure 12-2.
After you have the Cycle Region set up the way that you want, export the
song as I describe in the next section.

Chapter 12: CD Recording, Reproduction, and Distribution

Exporting your song to iTunes
Before you can burn a CD, you must export your song from GarageBand to
iTunes. GarageBand only provides one way of doing this — by exporting an AIF
(also known as an AIFF or Audio Interchange File Format) file to iTunes. This
requirement happens to be perfect, because you want the song in the highest-
quality file format when you burn the CD — and that’s what AIF is — a high-
quality, uncompressed audio format. And you’re going to burn the CD using
iTunes, which is where GarageBand deposited the AIF file that it exported.
See how convenient that is?
Chapter 13 discusses file formats, audio quality, and file size in great detail,
so flip to that chapter for more info.
So, use these steps to export a file to iTunes:
1. Set up GarageBand’s Export Preferences pane by choosing
GarageBand➪Preferences and then clicking the Export button at the
top of the window.
The Export Preferences pane is shown in Figure 12-3.
Figure 12-3:

ignate the

and the
album
name.
Figure 12-2:

230
Part IV: Sharing Your Creations with Others 

2. While filling in the blanks is optional, GarageBand allows you to
choose an iTunes playlist, a composer name, and an album name.
If you type in the name of a playlist that doesn’t already exist, GarageBand
creates a playlist by that name the first time a song is exported. The song
name will be the same as the file name in GarageBand; the artist name and
album name will be what you type into the Composer and Album Name
fields.
3. When you have set the destination playlist, choose File➪Export to
iTunes.
Figure 12-4 shows the export option in the File menu.
GarageBand creates a mix of the song based on your settings (what
you’ve done to your song up to now), creates an AIF file from that mix,
exports that AIF file to iTunes, and then opens iTunes — all without you
having to lift a finger (after choosing File➪Export to iTunes, of course).
Creating the Final CD
After your file is ready to burn, as I explain how to do in the preceding sec-
tion, you can move on to create the final product. This section shows you
how to burn one or many copies of your masterpiece and label them, too.
Burning the CD on your Mac
Burning a CD using your built-in disc burning drive (your CD-R, CD-RW,
Combo, or SuperDrive) is incredibly easy. Just follow these steps:
1. Open iTunes (in your Applications folder), if it’s not already the active
application.
2. Choose iTunes➪Preferences, or press Ô-, (Ô-comma).
Figure 12-4:
Exporting a

231
Chapter 12: CD Recording, Reproduction, and Distribution

3. Click the Burning button at the top of the main window to display the
Burning pane, as shown in Figure 12-5.
4. In the Burning pane, choose Maximum Possible from the Preferred
Speed pop-up menu.
5. Select the Audio CD radio button in the Disc Format section.
6. Choose how much silence you want between songs from the Gap
between Songs pop-up menu.
I like to have a two-second gap between songs; you can choose from
zero to five seconds between songs.
7. Click the OK button to close the Burning pane.
8. On the left side of the iTunes main window, select the playlist that con-
tains the song (or songs) that you want to burn in the Source column.
iTunes will try to burn the entire playlist. If 76 different versions of
“Mega Smash Hit Tune” are on the playlist when you burn the disc,
iTunes burns as many of the versions as it can fit on the disc. So check
your playlist to ensure that it contains only the songs that you want to
burn before clicking the Burn Disc icon.
The number of tracks, the total playing time of the tracks, and total size
of the tracks appear at the bottom of the iTunes window when a playlist
is selected. As you can see in Figure 12-6, for my playlist, those numbers
are 7 songs, 7.1 minutes, and 72.1MB.
9. Click the Burn Disc icon in the upper-right corner of the iTunes window.
10. When iTunes asks you to insert a blank disc, as shown in Figure 12-6,
pop the disc into your CD drive.
iTunes checks the disc and then illuminates the Burn Disc icon a second
time.
Figure 12-5:
iTunes’

232
Part IV: Sharing Your Creations with Others 

11. Click the Burn Disc icon again to burn the selected playlist to the
blank disc that you just inserted.
That’s it. Once you click that Burn Disc icon the second time, you can
stick a fork in your CD — it’s as good as done.
And it was so easy, no?
Making multiple copies of the same CD
At some point, you will want to make multiple copies of the same CD. You can
do it two ways; each way has advantages and disadvantages, depending on
your needs.
Burn ’em yourself with a CD duplicator
iTunes allows you to burn the playlist onto as many CDs as you like. Repeat
the previous instructions as many times as necessary.
Obviously, this method works best if you only need a few copies. While a 
diligent person could burn a gross of CDs one a time (a gross is 12 dozen —
144 discs), if you need larger quantities, consider buying a CD duplicator 
that connects to your Mac or buying a stand-alone CD duplicator that can
burn discs in batches of 25, 100, or more.
These devices automatically produce multiple CDs, one after another. Some
print and affix a label to the CD at the same time; others print the label directly
onto the CD. And some need to be connected to a Mac to be used; others are
stand-alone devices that don’t require a computer.
CD-duplicating equipment used to cost tens or even hundreds of thousands
of dollars. Today, CD duplicators can be found for less than $500, an amazing
reduction in the barrier to entry for do-it-yourself CD production.
Figure 12-6:

233
Chapter 12: CD Recording, Reproduction, and Distribution

Using one of these devices is far beyond the scope of this book; suffice it to
say many brands and models of CD duplicators are on the market.
A quick Google search turned up a site called Disqworks with information
about a number of different CD duplicator brands and models. Here’s the
Web address:
www.disqworks.com/en/automated_duplicators_copiers.html
I haven’t tested any duplicators, so do your research before you buy. Many
reviews are available on the Internet, so the information shouldn’t be too
hard to find.
Have someone else do it for you
Consider one other option: If you need a lot of CDs — 100 or more — consider
having the work done by a company that specializes in duplicating media.
This will cost more than burning them yourself, but it has the following big
benefits:
 The CD will be a “real,” pressed CD as opposed to a burned CD-R.
People in the know will be more impressed with the former than the
latter.
Having a pressed CD can add enormous perceived value to your CD. Think
about it: When was the last time you cared about a burned CD, even if it
came with a label? CD-R discs have become so common that people tend
to treat them with disdain. A pressed CD, on the other hand, is something
that you buy from a store, and people will treat it accordingly.
 If you send your CDs out to be pressed, you save a ton of time com-
pared to burning them yourself. The question is, how much is your
time worth?
As with CD-duplicating equipment, the details of CD manufacturers fall
beyond the purview of this book.
I can, however, point you in the proper direction. You can find a very good
article about burning CDs versus pressing CDs, by Trikuare Studios. Check
out this site:
http://trikuare.cx/audio/cb-cafepress.html
The site includes links to manufacturers and distributors and an extensive
cost analysis. I can’t endorse the opinions on the page, but you should find
enough information there to get you started.

Lovely labels for your CDs
If you are trying to make a good impression on someone, make a label for
your CD. A variety of label-making kits are available, including some that
work with your printer, as well as dedicated label makers. A couple of my
Epson printers can print directly on the surface of a CD.
If you plan to make a lot of copies, you may prefer to buy one of the dedi-
cated CD duplicators that I mention earlier in this chapter. These units can
burn and label 25, 50, or more copies of a CD without human intervention.
If you have someone else do it for you, chances are the price you pay per
disc includes labeling and jewel cases.
Distributing CDs
As Steve Jobs is famous for saying, “There is one last thing,” and that one
thing is distribution for your CD.
Now if all you care to do is to send one CD to Aunt Edna, distribution isn’t an
issue. But if you want the whole world to hear your music, you’re going to
want some type of distribution for your CD.
Two popular companies that provide distribution services are CD Baby and —
believe it or not — Amazon.com. Read on to take a quick look at both.
CD Baby
CD Baby (www.cdbaby.com) is a nifty online music store for unsigned acts.
Here’s how they describe their company:
CD Baby is a little online record store that sells CDs by independent
musicians.
[In•de•pen•dent: (adj.) Not having sold one’s life, career, and creative
works over to a corporation.]
That’s right — all that CD Baby does is sell CDs by musicians who don’t have
(and in many cases, don’t want) a recording contract with a music company.
The deal is pretty good, and a nice chunk of change — $6 to $12 per CD
according to the CD Baby Web site — goes directly to the artist.
235
Chapter 12: CD Recording, Reproduction, and Distribution

Compare that to the biggest major-label artists, who are lucky if they make
more than a couple of bucks for each CD.
So for their piece of the selling price, CD Baby handles the financial transac-
tions and shipping, and then pays the artist weekly.
CD Baby has a good reputation as the online destination for independent
artists. Because they work on consignment, you need to press your own CDs
and do your own promotion to spread the word about your music. On the
other hand, a stranger may come across your CD while browsing at CD Baby.
As of this writing, CD Baby claims to have sold 875,146 CDs from some 58,818
artists, with a payout of more than US$6.9 million going to those artists since
1997.
Amazon.com
You can also consider selling your music on Amazon.com. It’s easy enough to
get your merchandize listed at Amazon, and you can do so in one of two ways:
 Marketplace: To get to the Marketplace area, click the Sell Your Stuff
button at the top of the Amazon home page and select Marketplace. To
sell through Marketplace, you need to handle the shipping (also known
as fulfillment) yourself; Amazon handles only the financial transaction,
charging a fee for each item that it sells.
Pay attention to the way that the company assesses shipping fees,
because you are required to charge the same fees that Amazon charges
to ship from its warehouses, even though you aren’t likely to get any-
where near the same shipping rates. Amazon suggests that you build the
shipping cost into the pricing of your CD, which ain’t a bad idea.
 Advantage program: Another option at Amazon.com is the Retailer’s
Advantage program. If you are accepted in the Advantage program,
Amazon will stock your CD (on consignment, of course) and handle ful-
fillment, paying you 45 percent of the list price (as of this writing) for
that service.
You can find more information by clicking the Sell Your Stuff button on
the Amazon.com home page and then selecting Advantage.
Having your CD listed at Amazon.com is another one of those perceived value
tricks that you can use to lend your music credibility. To test this theory, tell
someone that he can buy your CD on Amazon.com and see whether he is
impressed. (I bet he will be.)

More distribution ideas
I want to mention one last thing about distribution: You may want to look
around your hometown for local record shops that can sell your CD. Like 
the others, you will probably get a consignment deal. So if the record shop
doesn’t sell any copies of your CD, you don’t make any money.
Most of the record stores that make such deals are independently owned and
operated — not the big names like Tower, Warehouse, or Best Buy. But don’t
let that stop you from pitching your CD to any local store. One never knows,
do one? (Apologies to Archie McNally for stealing his phrase.)
Be careful if you do get your CD in a local record store. You may experience a
rapid rise in heartbeat the first time you see your CD between The Beastie
Boys and The Beatles or between Emerson, Lake, and Palmer and Eminem.

Creating Smaller Audio Files for
iPods, E-Mail, and the Web
In This Chapter
 Understanding compression
 Making AAC and MP3 files
 Distributing your music
G
arageBand exports exactly one file format — the one known as Audio
Interchange File Format (with extensions of aif, aiff, AIF, or AIFF).
Fortunately, AIF files are the gold standard of audio files, the highest-of-high-
quality uncompressed audio that you can save on a disc; you couldn’t ask for
better. AIF files sound great, but a cost is incurred: The files are huge — too
big to send via e-mail or download or to stream from the Internet.
AIF files are, by definition, uncompressed. They’re usually five to ten times
the size of a song in its compressed form (that is, encoded or ripped). Other
audio file formats, such as MP3 and AAC, are compressed and are much
smaller — by 50–95 percent — than the same song uncompressed.
Compression, by its nature, takes away part of the sound. In theory, it’s the
part that people can’t hear, but some people do notice a big difference between
uncompressed audio and compressed audio, even on cheap stereo systems.
Others can’t tell any difference.
Some people can hear the difference between compressed audio files that are
encoded (ripped) at bit rates of 160 and 192 Kbps. Others hear no difference.
The smaller compressed audio files sound good enough to most people most
of the time and have become a de facto standard for consumer audio.

iPods (and most other personal music players) and iTunes (and most other
personal music-playing software not made by Microsoft) can play both
uncompressed and compressed files. But most people store most of their
music as compressed audio files, allowing five, eight, or even ten times as
many songs to be stored in the same amount of hard drive space.
Compression is all about choices, so this chapter looks at those choices and
describes how to compress an audio file to send via e-mail, use with an iPod
(or other digital audio device), or put on the Web.
But first, consider the big picture: What is compression, and how does it
affect audio quality and file size?
Choosing a Compression Type
The quality of an AIF file is top-of-the-heap because it, by definition, contains
100 percent uncompressed audio. Nothing has been added or removed; every
note, breath, harmonic, overtone, string noise, buzz, hiss, and other sound in
the master recording is in an AIF file.
AIF is the real deal. The songs on your store-bought audio CDs are AIF files
(or at least your Mac thinks they are), as you can see in Figure 13-1.
Technically, the files on an audio CD are “Red Book Audio” files, which are
slightly different from AIF files. The technical aspects aren’t important; the
important part is that when you shove an audio CD into your Mac, it sees Red
Book Audio files and automatically thinks of them as AIF files, as shown in
Figure 13-1:
Insert an
audio CD,
and your
Mac sees
AIF files.
240
Part IV: Sharing Your Creations with Others 

Figure 13-1. No conversion or translation is needed — to your Mac, Red Book
Audio files are AIF files, and vice versa, even if the rest of the world says that
Red Book and AIF are different.
The problem is, while uncompressed audio may be the right format for shiny
silver discs, it’s not the right format for e-mail or the Web, because as I’ve
said before, AIF files are gargantuan.
Fortunately, if you have GarageBand, you also have the right tool for com-
pressing AIF files, and in fact, that tool is already open and ready to rip. I’m
talking, of course, about GarageBand’s iLife brethren (or sisteren), iTunes.
With iTunes, it’s child’s play to compress (rip or encode) AIF files into MP3,
AAC, or even Apple’s new high-quality lossless encoder, and it’s all done
behind the scenes using iTunes built-in (and very high-quality) encoders.
MP3 and AAC are the two most common compressed audio file formats on
the Mac. MP3 came first and has essentially been the compressed audio stan-
dard for many years. Then, a couple of years ago, when Apple introduced the
iTunes Music Store, it also introduced the AAC file format, which it uses for
the store’s rights-protected songs.
Figure 13-2 is worth a couple of thousand words — it shows the same song
saved in all four formats and the size of each file. In Table 13-1, I give you a
handy reference to the different file types and the common ways in which
each type is used.
You find out how to save your own songs in those formats in the next section.

File Types Large and Small
File Type
Compressed?
What’s It Good For?
AIF
No
Audio CDs, iTunes, and archiving music in
the file format that retains the most audio
information. Can be used with iPod, but
files are 5–10 times the size of com-
pressed formats.
WAV
No
The equivalent of an uncompressed AIF
file on a Mac, this format is used for shar-
ing files with Windows users. File sizes
are 5–10 times the size of MP3 files, which
is the compressed file format of choice
among Windows users.
Apple lossless
No
iTunes and archiving music in the file
format that retains the most audio infor-
mation. Can be used with iPod but files are
3–7 times the size of compressed formats.
MP3
Yes
iTunes, e-mail, the Web, and sharing with
Windows users. Files are much smaller
than either uncompressed format, making
MP3s ideal for iPods. 
AAC
Yes
Same as MP3 but is Mac-only. Slightly
smaller files than MP3 and slightly better
sound quality in those slightly smaller files.
Alas, most Windows users can’t use AAC
files.
Making AAC and MP3 Files
After you export a song from GarageBand, iTunes launches itself so that you
can listen to your masterpiece. Using iTunes, it’s easy to create a much smaller
AAC or MP3 file (or Apple lossless file, which is roughly 30 percent smaller than
the AIF file and has the same sound quality) from this AIF file, as long as you
know the secret. Although it would be easy enough to select the song and then
choose Advanced➪Convert Selection to AAC in iTunes, that doesn’t give you
the opportunity to choose the file type and bit rate that you want to use. And,
depending on how you want to use your file, those options are important.
242
Part IV: Sharing Your Creations with Others 

As I mention in the previous section, different file types work better for differ-
ent purposes, whether that is playing a song on your iPod, e-mailing it to a
friend, or making sure that as many people as possible can listen to your
song however they want to.
And the compressed file formats can encode your song at different bit rates.
The higher the bit rate, the better the song will sound. Alas, the higher the bit
rate is, the bigger the file will be.
In the following steps, I go the extra mile for you, gentle reader, and explain
how to change AAC files to MP3 files with a menu choice, as well as the secret
of changing the bit rate for the converted song.
The secret, my friends, is in iTunes Preferences. So, to set the file type and bit
rate before you convert, follow these steps:
1. Open the Preferences window by choosing iTunes➪Preferences or by
pressing Ô-, (that’s Ô-comma).
2. In the Preferences window, click the Importing tab button at the top.
You see a window that looks like Figure 13-3. The three items at the top
of the window — the Import Using and Setting pop-up menus and the
Details summary — are the ones that you’ll be working with today.

3. Choose which encoder to use (AAC, MP3, Apple lossless, or WAV) from
the Import Using pop-up menu.
Which encoder should you choose? That depends; read on:
• MP3: If your song has a chance of encountering a Windows com-
puter without a copy of iTunes, MP3 is the better and safer choice.
Dozens of audio players for Windows can play MP3 files, but only
iTunes for Windows can play AAC files.
• AAC: AAC is a better choice than MP3 unless you intend to share
your music files with a Windows user. AAC generates better-
sounding audio files that are slightly smaller than their MP3 
counterparts.
• Apple lossless: Fitting somewhere between compressed and
uncompressed file formats, Apple lossless encoding creates a file
that is sonically identical to its AIF counterpart but is 10–30 per-
cent smaller. AAC and MP3 files are still much smaller, but they’ve
been compressed and have had some material — mostly things
you can’t hear — removed to reduce the file size. If you’re an audio
purist, you may prefer a lossless format (this one or the even-
bigger AIF format) for long-term archiving of your songs.
• WAV: This is the Windows equivalent of an AIF file on the Mac. If
you want to provide a Windows user with an uncompressed audio
file, convert it to a WAV file and she will have no problem playing it.
Because WAV is an uncompressed format, though, it’s not a great
choice for music players or sharing on the Web.
For my own personal listening enjoyment, which means iTunes through
Tapco S-5 Reference Monitors at my desk and an iPod everywhere else, 
I use AAC files that are ripped at 160 Kbps. My ears tell me that AAC files
sound better than MP3 files with similar sizes and bit rates.
Here’s the bottom line: If you’re not sure whether the intended listener is
hip to iTunes, MP3 is your best and safest bet.
4. Choose the bit rate that you want to encode with:
• If you chose MP3 in Step 3, the Setting pop-up menu offers four
choices: Good Quality (128 Kbps), High Quality (160 Kbps), Higher
Quality (192 Kbps), and Custom.
The settings menu for the MP3 encoder is shown in Figure 13-4.
If you choose Custom, click the Default Settings button first,
because the MP3 encoder’s default custom settings are the right
choice 99.9 percent of the time.
244
Part IV: Sharing Your Creations with Others 

• If you chose AAC in Step 3, the Setting pop-up menu offers but
two choices: High Quality (128 Kbps) and Custom. Choose High
Quality (128 Kbps) if that’s what you want; otherwise, choose
Custom. Leave the Sample Rate and Channels pop-up menus at
their default setting of Auto. That will be the correct setting 99.9
percent of the time.
5. Choose a bit rate from the Stereo Bit Rate pop-up menu, and then
click the OK button.
Before AAC came along, I ripped all my MP3s at the Higher Quality (192
Kbps) setting. Today, I believe my AAC files that are ripped at 160 Kbps
sound better than MP3 files ripped at 192 Kbps. And, AAC 160-Kbps files
are smaller than MP3 192-Kbps files.
Okay, to sum things up, files that are compressed at higher bit rates
sound better and use more hard drive space; files that are compressed
at lower bit rates sound worse and use less drive space. Got it?
6. When you’ve selected the file type and bit rate, click the OK button to
close the Preferences window.
7. Select the AAC file that you want to encode, and then choose
Advanced➪Convert Selection to AAC, MP3, Apple Lossless, or WAV,
depending on what you selected in the previous steps.
Shortly thereafter, the compressed version will magically appear in your
iTunes Library.

How much compression can you stand?
Some ears are more sensitive or discerning
than others. So how much different do songs
that are ripped (compressed or encoded) at dif-
ferent bit rates sound to you?
Here’s an easy way to find out:
The trick is to create an audio CD that has two
or three songs in their pristine, uncompressed
AIF versions, and the same songs as MP3 and
AAC files that are ripped at three or four differ-
ent bit rates.
With such a CD in hand, you can compare one
rendition to any other on any stereo system with
an audio CD player. The object is to figure out
the maximum amount of compression that your
ears can tolerate before the song starts to
sound noticeably worse than the “CD-quality”
version (that is, the AIF version).
To get started, think of two or three songs that
you know real well and have on a store-bought
CD. Songs with good dynamics and a combina-
tion of loud and soft passages will serve you
better than songs that are just loud (or just soft).
When you have the songs selected and the
store-bought CDs in hand, follow these steps:
1. Open iTunes Preferences (choose iTunes➪
Preferences or press Ô-,), and then click
the Importing button.
2. Select the AIFF Encoder in the Import Using
pop-up menu, and choose Automatic in the
Setting pop-up menu. Now click the OK
button.
3. Insert a CD, and select it in the iTunes
source list.
The songs appear with little check boxes in
front of each song’s title.
4. Hold down Ô and click any of the check
boxes to select or deselect the songs that
you want to hear.
5. Release Ô, select the check box next to
the song that you want to import, and then
click the big Import button at the upper-
right corner of the window.
6. Reopen iTunes Preferences and click the
Importing button again. This time, choose
the MP3 Encoder in the Import Using pop-
up menu and select Custom in the Setting
pop-up menu.
7. When the Custom MP3 Encoder Settings
dialog box appears, click the Use Default
Settings button first and then choose 64
Kbps from the Stereo Bit Rate pop-up menu.
Without changing any other settings, click
the OK button to close the dialog box.
8. Click to select the AIFF rendition of the
song (the one that you just imported).
Choose Advanced➪Convert Selection to
MP3, and wait a minute or two while it rips.

247
Chapter 13: Creating Smaller Audio Files for iPods, E-Mail, and the Web
One down; a few more to go.
9. Open iTunes Preferences and repeat Steps
6 through 8, but choose 320 Kbps in the
Custom dialog box instead of 64 Kbps. Click
the OK button when you’re done.
10. Click 
the 
AIFF 
rendition, 
choose
Advanced➪Convert Selection to MP3, and
wait a minute or two while this one rips.
11. Repeat Steps 6 through 8 two more times,
this time choosing AAC Encoder (instead of
MP3 Encoder) from the Import Using pop-
up menu. Now create 64- and 320-Kbps
AAC versions as before.
When you’re done, you should have five
versions of the same song: an AIF version,
MP3 and AAC versions at 64 Kbps, and MP3
and AAC versions at 320 Kbps.
12. Create a playlist, drag all five versions of
the song to it, make a note of the order in
which they will play, and burn an audio CD.
Now listen to this CD in all the usual places —
in your car, on your Mac audio system, in the
den, and so on. Listen to the first track for a
moment and then skip to another track and
compare.
The disc that you just made illustrates the
extremes — 64 Kbps is a lot of compression,
and most people can hear the difference
between the 64-Kbps files and the higher-bit-
rate files. The bigger question is whether you
hear any difference between 320 Kbps and 1411
Kbps (uncompressed). Unless your ears are
pretty darned good, you probably can’t.
You may want to make a disc or two with less
difference between the bit rates. I like to try to
hear the difference between 128, 160, and 192,
which are three common bit rates.
I’ve listened to the same song at different bit
rates a few times and settled on AAC at 160
Kbps as my everyday setting. I couldn’t hear
much or any difference between 160 Kbps and
192 Kbps, and even if there was a difference, it
wasn’t enough to justify the bigger (192 Kbps)
files.
One last thing: Feel free to put additional songs
or bit-rate variations on your CD if you have
enough space for them.

Distributing Your Music
You may want to send this song that you made in GarageBand and com-
pressed in iTunes to your friend via e-mail, or you may post the compressed
version on a Web page. You know where that song is located in iTunes. It’s in
the iTunes Library, right?
But where is the actual file on your hard drive?
The easy way to find the actual file for any song that’s in your iTunes Library
is to select the song (click it) and then choose File➪Show Song File or press
Ô-R. Thinking of this command as “Reveal Song File (in Finder)” helped me
memorize this shortcut quickly.
The Finder becomes active, the appropriate window opens, and the song file
is selected.
That’s where it is on your hard drive.
Of course, you can also use the search field in the Finder windows to search
your iTunes Music folder, but using the iTunes Show Song File command is
faster if iTunes is open; if it’s not open, the search field in the Finder windows
may be faster.
E-Mailing AAC or MP3 files
There’s nothing special about compressed audio files (AAC or MP3). Well,
there’s something special — they sound almost as good as files ten times
their size — but there’s nothing special about enclosing an MP3 or AAC file in
an e-mail message.
Just as you would with any other type of file, to send a music file to someone,
create an e-mail message, address it to your friend, and then drag the song
file right onto it, as I’m doing in Figure 13-5.
If you’re sending the file to a PC user, it’s safer to send an MP3 file than an
AAC file. See the section, “Choosing a Compression Type,” earlier in this
chapter, for details about the different file types and the ways that you can
use them.
Windows users can play AAC files if they have a copy of iTunes for Windows,
which they can download for free. In that case, send the AAC file, which pro-
vides more sound in a smaller package.
Here’s the bottom line: If you have any doubt, send an MP3.

Posting your song on the Web
This is going to be a short section. If you’re Web-savvy and know how to
make and modify a Web page, you already know how to do what I describe in
this section.
If you don’t make Web pages regularly, I’m sorry to inform you that I can’t
possibly teach you enough about coding in HTML and Web servers in the
space that remains in this chapter.
Heck, I don’t think I could do that even if I could use the whole rest of the book!
However, to get the nitty-gritty on this popular subject, check out HTML 4 For
Dummies, 4th Edition, by Ed Tittel and Natanya Pitts (published by Wiley).
But never fear, gentle reader, I do have a couple of suggestions that will almost
certainly appeal to you non-Web slingers — and may even be of interest to
those who code in HTML.
If you aren’t comfortable coding your own Web pages, there’s still hope. It
will cost you $100 a year, but you’ll have the ability to create very nice Web
pages in just minutes and without learning a thing about HTML, code,
servers, or other complicated stuff.
I’m talking about Apple’s .Mac (that’s “dot Mac”) online service, which,
among other things, allows anyone to create Web pages like mine quickly and
easily. See Figure 13-6.
That’s really one of my .Mac pages. Feel free to call yourself a friend and
download a song or two. The URL is as follows:

To create a page like the one that’s shown in Figure 13-6, merely drag any files
that you want to offer for downloading into the Public folder on your iDisk.
What’s an iDisk? It’s a 100MB virtual disk that’s free with every .Mac member-
ship. When you copy files to specific folders on your iDisk, the files become
available to use in your Web pages. The files in Figure 13-6 are in my iDisk’s
Public folder; I just picked a template to use, and .Mac did the rest, populat-
ing the download list with the names of the files in the Public folder.
Here’s another cool .Mac trick: Drag a movie file into your iDisk’s Movies
folder, and you can create a Web page that streams the movie for viewing
with a Web browser, as shown in Figure 13-7.
I made the page in Figure 13-7 in literally 2 minutes. You’ll find this one at the
following URL:

The point is, for a hundred bucks, you can not only share your music, movies,
and much more without having to learn how to code Web pages, but the pages
also look great and are fast and easy to make. I know how to make Web pages
the old-fashioned way, by coding HTML, but to be honest, I use the .Mac tem-
plates most of the time for quick-and-dirty pages and file sharing.
There’s more to .Mac than easy Web pages. I mean, it would be a great value
if the Web pages were the whole package, but they’re only a fraction of what
$100 a year buys for you. In addition to the Web tools, you get free utilities
and games, free training materials, free music and sound effects to use with
iMovie or Final Cut Pro, discounts on some Apple (and third-party) products
and services, and much more.
Let me put it this way: I had a free .Mac reviewer’s subscription. When it
expired, I renewed and paid for two more years.
That says something about how much I like it; you can find out more at www.

Using GarageBand Recordings
with Other iLife Applications
In This Chapter
 Using your GarageBand compositions with iMovie
 Using your GarageBand compositions with iDVD
 Using your GarageBand compositions with iPhoto slideshows
T
his will be a very short chapter, but don’t blame me. Why? Because using
music that’s made with GarageBand in your iMovie or iDVD projects, or
iPhoto slideshows, is drop-dead simple. Put another way, Apple did all the
heavy lifting, so after you’ve mixed and mastered a song in GarageBand and
exported it to iTunes, all that you have to do to use it with other iLife applica-
tions is to click a couple of times in the right places — and you’re done.
So all that is left is for me to show you the right places to click, which won’t
take more than a handful of pages.
Using Your GarageBand Compositions
with iMovie
If you’re a Mac moviemaker, you can create your own film scores using
GarageBand. While GarageBand isn’t designed for scoring movies, it’s a
simple-enough proposition.

You may not have to compose much; loops are often all that you need to
score a movie. Or you can use a synthesizer software instrument to create
moody, atmospheric soundtracks with almost no effort. Chapter 5 is all about
loops, and Chapter 6 has the details on recording software instruments.
The first thing to do is to determine how much music the movie will require.
After you figure that out, compose a song or songs of the appropriate length
or lengths in GarageBand.
At this point, you can just master and export the song to iTunes and then
import the song into iMovie, but if you want to watch the video and audio
together before you master and export, there’s one little problem:
GarageBand doesn’t do that.
It’s no big deal if you are sure that the audio and video will work together, but
if you think you may have to go back and tweak the song in GarageBand, here’s
a way to watch the video and listen to the audio, roughly in sync with each
other, without having to remix, remaster, and export the song each time you
make a change.
PseudoSync: Previewing the movie score
I call this technique PseudoSync, because you’re going to simulate synchro-
nizing the video that’s playing in iMovie with the audio that’s playing in
GarageBand by running both programs at once.
If you don’t have at least 512MB RAM and/or a speedy G4 or G5 processor,
the procedure may not work or may not work well. It’s worth trying, but be
forewarned.
Okay, follow these steps to simulate synchronizing the video to your song in
GarageBand:
1. Open the audio project in GarageBand and the video project in
iMovie.
2. Arrange their windows so that you can click the Play button in
both programs easily, as shown in Figure 14-1. (But don’t click
Play just yet.)
3. Move the playhead to the appropriate location in the song (in
GarageBand) and in the movie (in iMovie) before you click 
anything.
4. Click the Play button in GarageBand (as shown in Figure 14-1),
and then click the Play button in iMovie, as shown in Figure 14-2.

Chapter 14: Using GarageBand Recordings with Other iLife Applications

If your timing was right, the music in GarageBand and the video in
iMovie will play more or less in sync with each other. This trick works
because the GarageBand’s audio continues to play in the background,
even after you switch to iMovie.
When you create your song in GarageBand, allow a measure or two of
silence at the beginning of your GarageBand project. That gives you
enough time to switch applications and click the iMovie Play button
so that the movie starts in sync with the audio.
5. Watch and listen a few times, and if you feel that the audio and video
don’t work together as well as you would like, return to GarageBand,
make your changes, and do the whole thing again.
Repeat as necessary until the audio fits the video like a glove.
Previewing your song with your movie isn’t required. You can master and
export the song and then import it into your iMovie project without this
whole sync and dance. But syncing and dancing can save you tons of time
if you need to make changes to the audio.
Finishing the movie score
When you’re satisfied that your audio fits the movie like a glove, master the
audio and export it to iTunes in the usual way. (See Chapter 11 for more
about mastering and exporting.) Then, you can use the score in iMovie by
merely clicking the Audio button and dragging the song from the iTunes
Library that appears onto the iMovie Timeline, as shown in Figure 14-3.
You may have to click the Timeline button (which looks like a clock) to
switch to the Timeline view in iMovie.
When iMovie finishes importing the song, your iMovie project should look
like Figure 14-4, with the custom score on the track below your movie on
the Timeline.
And that’s all there is to it — you’ve created a custom soundtrack and added
it to your iMovie project.
You may want to convert the audio from an uncompressed AIF file to a com-
pressed format (AAC or MP3) before using it in iMovie. The compressed
audio file will sound almost as good but take up less hard drive space. In
Chapter 13, I explain how to compress AIF files into other file formats.

Using Your GarageBand Compositions
with iDVD
iDVD lets you create DVDs that can be watched on a television with almost
any recent-vintage DVD player.
If you want to create music that plays while a DVD menu is on-screen, it’s even
easier than using your own music with iMovie. You have no bothersome syn-
chronization to worry about when you make a DVD; the music plays when
the menu is on-screen.
It’s simple; just follow these steps to create a DVD that plays a song you cre-
ated in GarageBand while the DVD menu is on-screen:
1. Create a song of any length in GarageBand, and then master and export
it to iTunes.
2. Launch iDVD.
If your iDVD has more than one menu, make sure that the one you want
to add your song to is shown in iDVD’s main window.
3. Click the Customize button to open the Customize drawer (if it’s not
open already).
4. Click the Media button at the top of the Customize drawer.
5. Choose Audio from the pop-up menu, as shown in Figure 14-5. 
(The menu appears just under the Media button after you click it.)
6. Select the song in the song list.
7. Click the Apply button at the bottom of the Customize drawer.
The song will now play (and loop continuously) when this menu is 
on-screen.
You won’t hear the song if you’ve got the Motion menus turned off. So, if the
Motion button (in the lower-right corner of the iDVD screen) isn’t lit in green,
click it to turn on the Motion menus.
You can audition any song in your iTunes Library by clicking the Play button
at the bottom of the drawer. If you don’t like the song that you made in
GarageBand, you can choose any song in your iTunes Library by clicking
it and then clicking the Apply button.

Using Your GarageBand Compositions
with iPhoto Slideshows
If you’re a fan of iPhoto’s Slideshow feature, you’ll be pleased to know that
you can use your GarageBand compositions as background music for your
iPhoto slideshows. It’s as easy as adding your composition to an iDVD menu,
which is pretty easy.
Here’s a blow-by-blow account:
1. Create a song of any length in GarageBand, and then master and
export it to iTunes.
2. Launch iPhoto.
3. Select the photo album that you want in the Source list.
4. Click the Slideshow button at the bottom of the window.
5. Click the Music tab at the top of the Slideshow window.
6. Select the Play Music During Slideshow check box.
7. Choose iTunes Library (or a playlist) from the Source pop-up menu.

In this part . . .
T

ing GarageBand’s performance on your Mac. Chapter 17

Ten Handy GarageBand Add-Ons
In This Chapter
 Using Dent du Midi to make GarageBand work like a Karaoke machine
 Getting and staying in tune
 Playing with drum machines and guitar amp modelers
 Finding a free utility that lets you edit and modify Apple Loops
 Using your old VST plug-ins with GarageBand
A
s is the tradition here in Dummy-land, this chapter is part of The
Part of Tens. That means it’s guaranteed to contain a minimum of
ten somethings — in this case, third-party software and hardware items
that make GarageBand even better and more fun.
This chapter serves as a catchall for important stuff that isn’t covered
in the previous 14 chapters but should have been, and other stuff that 
I cover too briefly in previous chapters.
Any way you look at it, this chapter is chock-full of things that all GarageBand
music producers ought to know about. Some are free, and others cost more
than GarageBand itself, but what they all have in common is that they’re
worth knowing and may help you make better songs.
Using Dent du Midi for
GarageBand Karaoke 
One thing GarageBand doesn’t do is import MIDI. So if you have a MIDI file
with a fantastic arrangement of [your favorite song name here], you can’t get
those performances into GarageBand.
Or at least you couldn’t before Bery Rinaldo released Dent du Midi, a fantas-
tic free program that takes a standard MIDI file and creates separate software
instrument files for each track it contains.

Here’s a hot tip: If you don’t happen to have MIDI files of your favorite songs,
try the MIDI Explorer music search engine (www.musicrobot.com). It may
not find a great rendition of every song every time, but it’s the best I’ve found
so far.
For more information, visit Bery Rinaldo’s Web page:
http://homepage.mac.com/beryrinaldo/ddm
Tuning Tunable Instrument(s)
Tune up before you record. I don’t think I’ve mentioned this before, but it’s
really important. And, if you play guitar, bass, or any other stringed instru-
ment, it’s not only important, it’s critical.
Your Mac has perfect pitch, so your software instruments are always in tune.
If even one string is even slightly out of tune, your track may sound lousy.
Sometimes you can fix a bit of guitar out-of-tune-ness with Antares’ miracu-
lous Auto-tune plug-in (more on this later in this chapter), but if your guitar,
bass, or other tunable instrument is out of tune, chances are your recordings
of it will sound bad.
A few years back, your best bet would have been an electronic strobe-type
tuner for $50 or $100. I’ve got a few of them (that still work), but because my
guitar is plugged into my Mac already, I usually use a software tuner and just
tune up while looking at my Mac screen.
Go to www.versiontracker.com and search for tuners. You can find a hand-
ful of them. Try them all to see which one you like best.
Chromatic Tuner
My favorite tuner is probably a $5 shareware program by Hidetomo Katsura
called Chromatic Tuner, shown in Figure 15-1.
It’s easy to use and easy to see, even when you’re standing pretty far
back from your Mac display.
You can try it for free and buy it for $5 from the following site:
http://homepage.mac.com/katsura/shareware.html
264
Part V: The Part of Tens 

At $5, it’s a bargain. I paid for mine. If you decide you like it best, you should
as well.
Audio Units tuner
If GarageBand is open, I often use an Audio Units plug-in instrument tuner
that’s free from emagic (the makers of Logic, an Apple-owned company). This
tuner pops up on-screen when you choose it as an effect in the Track Info
window, as shown in Figure 15-2.
You can grab the tuner at www.emagic.de in the Downloads section.

up right in

Chapter 15: Ten Handy GarageBand Add-Ons

eMedia Tuner
Finally, if you own any of eMedia’s (not to be confused with emagic’s) excel-
lent Guitar Method CDs (like I do), all of them include eMedia Tuner, which is
shown in Figure 15-3. It’s a perfectly good on-screen tuner, and it won’t cost
you a penny, assuming that you own an eMedia guitar instruction CD.
As shown in Figure 15-3, the top A is glowing yellow and the arrow is to the
left of the line, meaning that the note is flat. The bottom A is glowing green
and the arrow aligns perfectly with the line, meaning that the note is on pitch.
Tuning Vocals and Instruments
after the Fact with Auto-tune
Auto-tune is an amazing tool that you use to correct the pitch of vocals or
other solo instruments in real time without distortion or artifacts. Recording
magazine called it “the holy grail of recording” and “amazing.” (And they
were talking about version 1, which was released way back in 1997.) Both
statements apply to version 4 in abundance, and I agree: Auto-tune is the
holy grail of recording.
Calling Auto-tune amazing is an understatement: It’s a miracle!
Figure 15-3:
Top: A flat
note.
Bottom: The

266
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Version 4 of the Auto-tune plug-in was released during the writing of this
book. It has an improved interface and several new features, as shown in
Figure 15-4.
Auto-tune 4 is still the same price — $399 — and I know it isn’t cheap. If you
can afford it, your vocals will sound like a million dollars.
That’s not a bad return on your investment of four hundred bucks!
Give the free 10-day trial version a spin, and I’m sure you’ll consider it money
well spent.
Several versions of the plug-ins are available; make sure that you download
the Audio Units version.
For more info and the demo, visit www.antarestech.com.
Creating Drum Loops and 
Tracks with iDrum
iDrum is a drum machine for OS X and GarageBand. For $50, you get both
a stand-alone application and an Audio Units plug-in for GarageBand. The
stand-alone version looks the same as the plug-in but can be used without
opening GarageBand.
Figure 15-4:

267
Chapter 15: Ten Handy GarageBand Add-Ons

It’s possible to create your own drum tracks and loops without iDrum, but the
GarageBand software instrument editor isn’t designed for heavy drum pro-
gramming. It’s far more tedious doing it with GarageBand’s built-in editor —
and not nearly as much fun.
There’s something gratifying about a drum machine. Programming drums on
one can be soothing, hypnotic, energizing, and profoundly gratifying, all at
the same time.
I think this bit from the iDrum Web page says it all:
Drum machine neophytes will get to experience the same magical ‘instant-
gratification’ fun that hooked an entire generation of musicians on the hard-
ware drum machines of yesteryear. Pros will find that there’s simply no faster,
easier way to access and manage large unwieldy drum sample libraries, get
a phat beat going, and get it exported into the format you need (and for less
money than a replacement pad for your MPC 3000).

Adding Extra Loops, Effects, and More
with GarageBand Jam Pack
If you’re having fun with GarageBand, you’ll have three times as much fun
with GarageBand plus the GarageBand Jam Pack, a $99 add-on to GarageBand
that adds over 2,000 new loops, more than 100 new effects presets, and over
100 new instruments, plus more than a dozen new guitar amplifier models.
Figure 15-5 shows the Software instrument folder before (left) and after (right)
adding the Jam Pack to my copy of GarageBand.
All of GarageBand’s support files, including loops and instruments, are stored
in the Library/Application Support/GarageBand folder. The instruments are
in the Library/Application Support/GarageBand/Instrument Library/Track
Settings/Software/ folder, and the loops are in the Library/Application Support/
GarageBand/Apple Loops/ folder.
I’ve heard complaints that the Jam Pack leans too much to rock, pop, and hip-
hop and that it leaves orchestral, jazz, and other types of music out in the
cold. The same can be said about the instruments and loops that come with
GarageBand. My answer is this: That’s probably true, but because rock, pop,
and even hip-hop are the kinds of music I listen to and play, it’s never been a
problem for me. I expect to see additional Jam Pack offerings from Apple in
the future.

Adding Guitar Amps and Effects
with AmpliTube
If you’re a guitarist and you like GarageBand’s built-in amplifier models,
you’ll love AmpliTube’s never-ending assortment of amps, speakers, pre-
amps, stomp box effects, and presets.
Even a mediocre guitar sounds great when you play it through AmpliTube,
the plug-in that the pros use. AmpliTube (www.amplitube.com) is shown
in Figure 15-6.
Hey, if it’s good enough for Brian May (of Queen), it’s good enough for me.
I love this thing. It provides preamp, EQ, amp, cabinet, and mic modeling — 
a total of 1,260 amp configurations in all, and they’re all based on classic
modern and vintage guitar amps and effects.
Why, AmpliTube even has presets to make you sound just like your favorite
guitarists — Stevie Ray, Carlos Santana, and The Edge, to name just a few.

Chapter 15: Ten Handy GarageBand Add-Ons

In my case it’s not just like them; rather, it’s kind of like them if you don’t listen
too closely.
AmpliTube doesn’t come cheap ($399), but it totally rocks and is a lot cheaper
than 1,260 amps. I recommend it highly, especially if you’re like I am and would
enjoy having multiple guitar and amp sounds available without the expense
of multiple guitars and amps.

I recommend AmpliTube wholeheartedly. Four hundred dollars is a small price
to pay for more than a thousand different guitar sounds.
Controlling GarageBand’s Features
with ShuttlePRO
The keyboard and mouse aren’t the perfect input devices when you’re produc-
ing audio (or video, for that matter). I don’t expect you to consider grandiose
solutions costing thousands of dollars, but I’ve found an inexpensive little
desktop controller that’s extremely useful when recording with GarageBand.
It’s called ShuttlePRO, a reasonably priced ($129), multibutton jog/shuttle
controller made by Contour Design.
ShuttlePRO is a USB device with its own driver software; it comes preconfig-
ured for dozens of audio and video apps, but not for GarageBand (as I write
this).
No problem, though. The Contour ShuttlePRO software, shown in Figure 15-7,
made it easy for me to set up all the buttons and knobs for GarageBand.
In Figure 15-7, I’m setting the middle button in the second row to send a
“space” character, which can play or pause GarageBand. I did the same for
all the buttons and both knobs, and I was able to control my most-used
GarageBand functions from ShuttlePRO instead of using the keyboard.
Figure 15-7:
I set each
button and
knob to do
what I
wanted in

271
Chapter 15: Ten Handy GarageBand Add-Ons

I’ve assigned the R key to Button 12, which means that when I press that
button (the lowest one on the left), GarageBand begins recording. In addition
to the Record button, I’ve configured other buttons to do the following and
put little labels on each button to remind me what it does:
 Zoom in and out (on the Timeline)
 Turn Cycle Region on or off
 Turn the Metronome on or off
 Move the playhead to the beginning or end of the song
 Play, rewind, and fast forward a track
 Create a new track
 Record
 Mute
 Solo
And, of course:
 Undo
I used ShuttlePRO with Final Cut Pro and iMovie for many years but
only recently realized that it would be wonderful for GarageBand, too.
Because my ShuttlePro is old, I had to whip up the configuration settings
for GarageBand (which was drop-dead simple). By the time you read this,
I’ll bet both ShuttlePRO and ShuttleXpress include GarageBand settings
right out of the box. Even if they don’t, it only took me about 5 minutes
to configure all the settings for GarageBand.
I’ve never used ShuttleXpress, but the PRO model is a fantastic tool that
can quickly pay for itself by saving you time whenever you record.
Check out ShuttlePRO at www.contourdesign.com/shuttlepro/.
Edit and Modify Loops with
the Soundtrack Loop Utility
You can edit and modify Apple Loops with the Soundtrack Loop utility. The
utility comes with Soundtrack and Final Cut Pro, but not with GarageBand.
The tip is that you can download a copy, complete with PDF instruction
manual, absolutely free from Apple, at the following Web site:
http://developer.apple.com/sdk/
272
Part V: The Part of Tens 

With this tool you can edit your loops or create new loops from scratch,
adding all of the keywords and other information used by GarageBand and
Soundtrack. If you want to make major changes to existing loops or use
your own recordings to create loops compatible with GarageBand, this is
the ticket (and it’s free).
Converting VST Plug-Ins to 
AU Plug-Ins for GarageBand
The folks at Antares actually suggested this program to me when I asked
about getting a copy of Auto-tune in the Audio Units (AU) plug-in format
that GarageBand requires. They explained that they were working on one
but that it wasn’t done yet.
But, they informed me, if I wanted to use Auto-tune now, all I needed was this
little $99 program from FXpansion Audio called VST to AU Adapter.
Of course, I got a copy the next day, and it converted my Auto-tune VST plug-in
to an Auto-tune Audio Units plug-in that worked with GarageBand. It took less
than a minute to set up and works flawlessly.
But it gets even better — I have used several audio programs over the years
that use VST plug-ins, so I had a couple of dozen of them on my hard drive,
including one of my favorite plug-ins, AmpliTube (which I discuss in the
section “Adding Guitar Amps and Effects with AmpliTube,” earlier in this
chapter).
Guess what? VST to AU Adapter converted every single one of them — every
VST effect that it found on my hard drive — to AU format. So now I get to use
several dozen excellent VST effects in GarageBand in addition to Auto-tune.
If you have more than one or two decent VST plug-ins on your hard drive,
FXpansion’s VST to AU Adapter is well worth $99.

Ten Ways to Improve
GarageBand’s Performance
In This Chapter
 Paying attention to the color of the playhead
 Changing the number of notes that software instruments can play simultaneously
 Hiding the track mixers while playing or recording
 Minimizing the GarageBand window while playing or recording
 Correcting a delay between playing and hearing
 Optimizing processor performance using the System Preferences application
 Getting more RAM
 Using a faster hard drive for audio files
I
must say that GarageBand is one of the most stable 1.0 releases that I can
remember. It’s doing a lot, and it rarely crashes or freezes. Still, it is a 1.0
release (1.1 as I write this), and it occasionally gives you trouble. That trou-
ble mostly affects its performance, which is why this little chapter offers ten
ways to shoot that trouble right between its beady little eyes and get your
GarageBand rocking again.
You’ll find that most GarageBand issues are related to performance. So, the
older your Mac (that is, the slower its processor), the more likely you are to
encounter performance issues.

If you have never (or almost never) seen the ugly warning dialog box that’s
shown in Figure 16-1, you are either lucky or you’re fortunate to use a Mac
with a fast G4 or G5 processor, 512MB RAM (or more), and at least one fast
(7,200 rpm) hard drive.
That has to be one of the most irritating dialog boxes ever to disgrace my
screen. I ought to be immune — I have a Power Mac G5 with dual 1.8 GHz
processors, 2GB RAM, and four fast external FireWire hard drives. I’ve seen
this dialog box more often than I care to admit on the G5, and I see it even
more often on my single-processor PowerBook G4.
The point is this: Even the fastest rigs are not immune.
Of course you can do as the dialog box says and look in GarageBand Help
under Performance. The tips that you find there are extremely helpful and
may do the trick. But alas, every single one of them includes a trade-off. So
over the next few pages I show you tips, techniques, and workarounds that
will help you keep making music.
Fortunately, while working on this book, I discovered one technique that
reduces the load on your Mac: ping-ponging or bouncing tracks, that age-old
technique from multitrack analog recording. Although this technique has a
trade-off (that is, it’s a pain in the butt), I can live with it, and it reduces the
load on your processor in GarageBand. See Chapter 10 for details on how this
technique works.
How do I know about ping-pong and analog recording? Well, before I became
a full-time Mac geek, for two years I studied audio engineering with multi-
Grammy-winning producer Bill Lazerus in L.A. I thought audio engineering
was going to be my life — I played guitar in a bunch of L.A. bands and pro-
duced several artists (and even managed to get one of ’em signed). It was
fun but the pay sucked, so instead of starving, I switched to advertising and
began producing audio and video for TV and radio commercials. Only after
becoming sick of that did I fall into my current full-time geek gig. Anyway, the
point is that I am a huge GarageBand fan, but I also have real-world audio pro-
duction experience.

NOOOO!! I
HATE when
it says that!
276
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Checking the Basics
Before I move on to the meat of the matter, because this is a Part of Tens
chapter and I only get ten shots, I’m going to cheat just a little and start with
a quick set of steps that you should try before you begin troubleshooting to
improve your performance (or tearing your hair out, as the case may be):
1. Close all open applications (other than GarageBand).
If you have other applications open while you’re using GarageBand,
they’re using up RAM and processing power that can be put to better
use. So when you’re using GarageBand, it’s a good idea to close all other
programs and give GarageBand more RAM and processor time to work
with.
2. Check all your cable connections.
3. Close GarageBand, and then reopen it.
4. Delete the GarageBand preference file (com.apple.garageband.plist)
from your Home/Library/Preferences folder.
5. Log off, and then log back on.
6. Restart your Mac.
If you’ve deleted your GarageBand preferences, every setting you modified
in GarageBand Preferences has been reset to the defaults — as they were
the first time you ever used GarageBand. You’ll probably want to open
GarageBand Preferences (GarageBand➪Preferences or Ô-,) to set the
preferences the way you like them again.
Another possible performance-robber is Panther’s FileVault feature; it
can cause excessive reading and writing to your hard drive that hurts
GarageBand’s performance. To turn FileVault off (or to check to see if
it’s turned on), follow these steps:
1. Launch the System Preferences application.
2. Click the Security icon.
3. If the text reads, FileVault protection is on for this account,
and the button to the right of the text says Turn FileVault Off, click the
button to turn FileVault off.
4. If the text reads, FileVault protection is off for this account,
and the button to the right of the text says Turn On FileVault, you’re
golden. You can quit the System Preferences application and go on
with your recording session.
277
Chapter 16: Ten Ways to Improve GarageBand’s Performance

If you can’t live without FileVault, storing your songs in any folder that’s out-
side your Home directory can help, although not as much as turning off
FileVault. Still, it may help enough to use GarageBand without turning off
FileVault.
Okay, now let’s get serious. The following sections give you some things to
try when GarageBand goes sour.
Paying Attention to the Color
of the Playhead
The triangular playhead indicator changes colors to indicate processor load.
The processor load is a good indication of when you’re in danger of seeing the
dreaded warning dialog box shown in Figure 16-1.
The triangular playhead glows different colors that reflect the load on your
CPU: white for low or no load, yellow for a moderate CPU load, and red for
the heaviest load.
Put another way, when the indicator in the playhead gets red and stays red,
you’re probably going to have your session interrupted by that pesky dialog
box soon.
When the playhead is dark yellow or red, you’re pushing your Mac to the
max. It won’t be long before you start hearing sound dropouts and seeing
warning dialog boxes.
So my first bit of advice is this: Watch the color of the playhead and use
some of the tips in this section (and the rest of the chapter) whenever you
see much red, and you may avoid some warning dialog boxes, stuttering
playback, and ruined recordings.
If you don’t fix the heavy processor load before it happens, that dialog box
or an audio dropout will probably wreck the take. And that could wreck your
whole day. So try some of the techniques in this chapter whenever you’re
seeing red.
Adding tracks and effects increases the load on your Mac’s processor, and
some complex effects, like the Amp models, use more processor time than
others. So Apple recommends turning off some effects or reducing the
number of tracks to reduce the strain on your processor — and I agree.
This is probably the quickest, easiest fix for performance problems: If you
don’t need the track or effect right now, mute it (track) or turn it off (effect).

Alas, at times, such as when you’re mixing or mastering, this isn’t possible,
so keep reading for more tricks that you can try when things bog down.

The maximum number of software instrument tracks in a song is determined
by how much RAM you have installed. You can change the number of tracks
in GarageBand Preferences by pressing Ô-, (Ô and comma) and making the
change on the Advanced preferences pane, as shown in Figure 16-2.
GarageBand chooses Automatic for you, which automatically selects the
highest number of tracks that your computer can support.
Changing the number of tracks may improve performance, but setting it
higher than your Mac can support will almost certainly make performance
worse.
It’s usually best to leave it set to Automatic, but choosing a low setting (such
as 8 or 16) may improve performance.
The downside here should be obvious — you can only have eight or fewer
real instrument tracks, which may not be enough for your project.
I have one word for y’all: ping-pong. (Is that one word or two?) Chapter 10
has the details.

Changing the Maximum Number of
Software Instrument Tracks
The maximum number of software instrument tracks in a song is determined
by how much RAM you have installed. You can change the number of tracks
in GarageBand Preferences (press Ô-,), as shown in Figure 16-3.
GarageBand again chooses Automatic.
Changing the number of software instrument tracks may improve perfor-
mance, but setting it higher than your Mac can support will almost certainly
make performance worse.
So to summarize: It’s probably best to leave the maximum number of soft-
ware instrument tracks set to Automatic unless you’re having performance
issues. If you are, setting it to 8 or 16 may help.
The downside here should be obvious — you can only have eight or fewer
software instrument tracks, which may be too few for your song.
Same word as the previous tip: ping-pong.

Changing the Number of Notes That
Software Instruments Can Play
Simultaneously
The maximum number of notes that software instruments can play at once
depends on the processing power of the CPU in your computer. The number
is different for sampled instruments, which use recordings of actual instru-
ments (like bass, guitar, piano, drum, brass, and woodwind instruments) than
for the other, truly synthesized instruments (including synthesizers, electric
piano, organ, and clavinet instruments).
GarageBand automatically chooses the appropriate number voices per instru-
ment based on the muscle of your CPU, but you can change the number in
GarageBand Preferences (GarageBand➪Preferences or Ô-,) on the Advanced
pane, as shown in Figure 16-4.
The number of notes includes notes that are still being held when a new note
starts. Because this setting is global and applies to all of your tracks together,
“10 sampled, 5 other” may not be enough for a song with more than one or two
software instrument tracks.

Hiding the Track Mixers while 
Playing or Recording
The Track Mixer column is the one that has the level (volume) fader (slider),
the pan pot (knob), and the simulated LED level meters. To hide it, as shown
in Figure 16-5, choose Track➪Hide Track Mixer or press Ô-Y.
It turns out that those little animated level meters use a ton of processing
power, and you really don’t need them much of the time.
So after you’ve set your level(s), press Ô-Y to hide the Track Mixer. Your Mac
will thank you for lightening its load by allowing GarageBand to do more before
it croaks.
Minimizing the GarageBand Window
while Playing or Recording
Minimizing the GarageBand window, as shown in Figure 16-6, provides a
respite for your processor.
Figure 16-5:
Hide the
mixer
column
while
listening or
recording.
282
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Minimizing the window is superior to hiding the track mixers — GarageBand
demands even less of your processor. But stashing the window in the Dock is
also less convenient.
Why is it less convenient? You have to remember to begin your recording (or
playback) before you minimize the window or you won’t be able to play or
record without maximizing the window again by clicking its icon in the Dock.
Which kind of defeats the whole purpose of minimizing it in the first place. . . .
Minimizing and maximizing the window places a lot of strain on your proces-
sor, so it’s best to do immediately after you begin to record or play a song.
The Count In feature (Control➪Count In) gives you four beats before record-
ing begins, which is plenty of time to minimize the window.
Correcting a Delay between 
Playing and Hearing
If you hear a slight delay between playing (or singing) and hearing what
you’re playing (or singing) on a real instrument track, you’re encountering
latency, which happens when a delay occurs between the time that the
sound reaches your Mac’s input port (whichever port that happens to be)
and when your CPU processes it.
If you’re experiencing latency, a setting in GarageBand Preferences allows
you to reduce it, but of course, there’s a trade-off. That trade-off, as you see
in a moment, is that you will be able to hear fewer tracks at the same time.
Figure 16-6:
Minimize
the window
(left), and it
is relegated
to the Dock
(right).
283
Chapter 16: Ten Ways to Improve GarageBand’s Performance

To reduce latency, follow these steps:
1. Open GarageBand Preferences by choosing GarageBand➪Preferences
or by pressing Ô-,.
2. Click the Audio/MIDI tab.
3. In the Optimize For section of the Audio/MIDI tab, select the Minimum
Delay When Playing Instruments Live; Small Buffer Size radio button,
as shown in Figure 16-7.
The small buffer setting shouldn’t be a problem when you’re recording — 
just mute some tracks that you don’t need to hear. But if you encounter
performance problems during mixing, select the Maximum Number of
Simultaneous Tracks; Large Buffer Size radio button.
Optimizing Processor Performance in
the System Preferences Application
On many Macs, you can find a setting in the System Preferences Energy Saver
pane that allows you to choose the performance level of your processor, as
shown in Figure 16-8.
To open System Preferences, choose it in the Apple Menu or open the OS X
Applications folder and double-click it. Click the Energy Saver icon to see the
Energy Saver System Preference pane.
When it comes to GarageBand performance, Automatic is not automatically
the best choice. Choose Highest from the Processor Performance pop-up
Figure 16-7:
Optimize for

(as shown)
or mixing
(choose
Large buffer
size) on
this tab.
284

menu, and your Mac will always use 100 percent of its processing power.
Choosing either of the other settings — Automatic or Reduced — causes
your processor to perform at less than its peak at certain times, which isn’t
good for GarageBand.
Before you close the System Preferences window, click the Energy Saver’s
Sleep tab and deselect the Put the Hard Disk(s) to Sleep When Possible check
box, as shown in Figure 16-9.

Chapter 16: Ten Ways to Improve GarageBand’s Performance

Upgrade Your Mac
If you’re having trouble building the kind of songs that you want to build
because your processor or hard drive is too slow and you keep getting
error messages, check out the following sections to find some things that
can help.
Getting more RAM
Almost every time I review a new Mac, I blast Apple for shipping it with
insufficient RAM for most people and many Apple applications, including
GarageBand. Unless your Mac came with 512MB or more of RAM, GarageBand
will almost certainly perform better if you add more RAM.
It’s easy to install RAM in most Macs — anyone can do it in 15 minutes
or less. For $50 or $60, you can add 256MB, or for roughly $110, you can
increase your RAM by 512MB. It’s worth every penny.
If you bump up your RAM to a gigabyte or more, GarageBand will run even
better — and allow you to have more tracks, instruments, effects, and notes in
your songs before the dreaded warning dialog boxes start to appear.
RAM prices are volatile. Those were the prices as of the summer of ’04.
By the time you read this, prices might move higher or lower.
External FireWire hard drive
Your internal hard drive isn’t fast enough for GarageBand, especially if you
use a notebook PC.
Most FireWire external hard drives run at higher speeds than your internal
hard drive. If you have a FireWire external hard drive, it’s probably faster
than the internal drive, so save your projects on the external drive.
Many pro audio programs recommend saving your projects to any hard drive
except your boot disk (that is, the disk with Mac OS X and GarageBand on it).
It’s a good idea to do so with GarageBand as well. If you save your projects on
an external hard drive, you are likely to see fewer warning messages about
the speed of your Mac or your hard drive.
If you’re considering using a FireWire drive, look for drives that run at 7,200
rpm or higher, rather than the cheaper — and more common — 5,400-rpm
drives. Most drive vendors display the speed of a drive in the product
description; if you don’t see it, ask about it.
286
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Finally, if your Mac has FireWire 800, as many do today, a FireWire 800 drive
that runs at 7,200 rpm is even faster and can further reduce warning messages.
A FireWire 800 drive costs a bit more than a FireWire 400 unit (that is, a stan-
dard FireWire device), but it is worth it if you have a Mac that supports the
faster flavor of FireWire 800.
FireWire 800 devices are backward compatible, so they can be used with your
Mac’s FireWire 400 ports as well as with FireWire 800 ports. (The ports look
slightly different and require different cables.) You won’t get increased speed
when you use a FireWire 800 device with a FireWire 400 port, but if you’re
planning to buy a new Mac, and the new Mac will have FireWire 800, it’s a
good investment to buy a FireWire 800 drive and plug it into your FireWire
400 port now — and plug it into the new Mac’s FireWire 800 port later.
Processor upgrade
Many Macs can be upgraded with third-party processor upgrade cards. I don’t
recommend this approach. For the money that you would put into the upgrade
plus the money that you could get by selling your old Mac, you could almost
certainly afford a new or slightly used Mac, which is a better deal.
Each generation of Mac models has new and improved features that you
won’t get if you only buy a processor upgrade. So, while your processor will
be faster, everything else — hard drives, CD-ROM drives, system bus, RAM
bus, and so on — is still slow and old. A new Mac would have a newer, faster
hard drive, CD-ROM, buses, and so on — for only slightly more money.
Here’s another thought: Apple doesn’t sell processor upgrades, so if the new
processor doesn’t work right, you have to deal with the seller, not Apple. And
not all processor upgrades work well.
Caveat emptor.

Ten Ways to Take Your Recordings
to the Next Level
In This Chapter
 Discussing microphones yet again
 Tuning your room so recordings sound better
 Making your songs sound better by throwing cash at them
O
kay, now that you understand how to work with GarageBand, here are
some ways that you can make your songs even better. Alas, most of the
suggestions in this chapter cost money, but each one will contribute to making
your GarageBand compositions sound even better than before.
Get a Better Microphone(s)
If you record acoustic instruments or vocals, an easy way to make your
recordings sound better is to use a better microphone. You can find details
about getting a microphone to suit your needs in Chapter 2. Audio magazines
and Web sites are another good source of more detailed information about
mics: These sources review recording equipment all the time, and they may
be your best bet for learning more about specific mics and models.
That said, here are a few general tips about microphones:
 You don’t have to spend a lot of money to get a decent mic. Don’t spend
more than $200 on a mic unless you are extremely serious about record-
ing. Many excellent microphones are available for $200 or less.
 AKG, Audio-Technica, Sennheiser, and Shure are four companies that have
been in the microphone business for as long as I’ve been recording; they
all have products at many price points.

 Wind and pop screens can make a big difference in vocals. If you don’t
own one of these screens (described in detail in Chapter 2), consider
buying one or both of them.
 Good recordings require proper microphone placement and that’s hard
to do without good mic stands. Boom-style stands are more flexible than
the pole-type units, but the boom types are inherently less stable —
particularly the cheap ones. So, if you use boom mic stands, be careful
not to knock them over. It’s easy to damage the microphone, the stand,
or both.
Make Sure Your Speakers/Reference
Monitors Reproduce Sound Well
Nothing compares to hearing music that’s reproduced accurately. Unfortu-
nately, the speakers that are built into computers are junk — they don’t
come close to producing accurate sound. Most computer speakers with a
subwoofer are okay in a pinch, but if you’re serious about hearing every
little nuance, you should buy a set of speakers that reproduce sound as
accurately as possible. Such speaker systems are called reference monitors;
they can cost from a couple hundred dollars a set to thousands of dollars
per speaker.
Among the least expensive are those M-Audio Studiophile LX4 speakers that
I mention in Chapter 2 (visit www.m-audio.com). These speakers cost less
than $300 per pair and sound unbelievably crisp and clear. I recommended
them if you can spare the dough.
Also excellent and not much more expensive at around $400 are Tapco’s S-5
Active Studio Monitors, also mentioned in Chapter 2. If you can spend the
extra $100 and don’t care about the LX4’s ability to be expanded easily for
surround sound, these are the reference monitors you want.
Get Better Headphones
As I mention in Chapter 2, you should use sealed headphones — ones that
leak as little sound as possible — when you record. If you’re using cheap
headphones with porous foam ear cups, when you sing, some of the music
that you’re listening to is probably bleeding onto your track. Good sealed
headphones not only prevent such noises from leaking onto your track, but
they can also reproduce sound more accurately than cheaper models.
290
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Don’t underestimate the importance of good cans. You’ll almost certainly mix
and master faster and with fewer repetitions of the “play it, adjust it, remix it,
and remaster it” cycle.
Fine-Tune Mic Placement
The location of your microphone makes all the difference when you’re record-
ing. I’ve heard many recording engineers tell me that setting up the mics cor-
rectly can take longer than the actual recording session.
So don’t be afraid to experiment. If the acoustic guitar isn’t sounding quite
right to your ear, move the mic to the left or the right a little, point it up or
down slightly, or move it farther from the sound hole. Each small move
changes the sound that ends up on your track. If you take the time to dis-
cover the mic placement that sounds best to you, the resulting tracks will
sound that much better.
Improve Room Acoustics
Another thing to consider is the room that you’re recording in. It’s well known
that hard surfaces and parallel walls in your studio can resonate, reflect, and
reverberate sounds; these issues are undesirable when you’re recording. The
more hard surfaces (and parallel walls) in the room, the more yuck you hear
in the track. So, whenever you’re not getting the sound that you want from a
mic, try throwing some blankets or pillows over hard surfaces or moving the
mic to a part of the room with fewer hard or parallel surfaces.
I’ve been known to make a tent out of old quilts and record hand-held percus-
sion instruments by holding the instrument (usually a tambourine or mara-
cas) and the mic under the quilt tent. It may not be pretty, but it’s cheap and
it works.
Use Quality Cables
Most computer peripherals and audio devices include a cable or two. Isn’t
that nice? The problem is, many manufacturers throw in the cheapest cable
that they can buy. As a result, the quality may be lacking, and the cable may
become nonfunctional sooner than you expect.
291
Chapter 17: Ten Ways to Take Your Recordings to the Next Level

I’m not suggesting that you replace your existing cables with high-end cables
such as Monster Cable, but when you shop for cables, avoid the cheapest ones.
They won’t last as long, and because they use the cheapest available compo-
nents, they can also introduce unwanted noise and interference that you don’t
get with a better-quality cable.
If you’re a guitarist, you should have at least one mono 1⁄4-inch (phono) to
stereo 1⁄8-inch (miniphono) cable to connect your electric guitar directly to
your computer’s audio input port. I use the Monster Instrument Adapter.
You can probably find a similar cable at Radio Shack for less money. That
said, I’m perfectly happy with the Monster adapter, which costs only $20
at the Apple Store.
Add a Mixing Board to Your Studio
Even though GarageBand is capable of recording only a single track at a time,
there may be times when you want to record using more than one microphone,
even though all the sound will end up on a single track.
Here’s an example: A standard drum set needs as many as seven microphones
to be recorded well. In big-time audio recording, this would be a no-brainer:
Set up the microphones and then record each one on a different track. But in
GarageBand, this is a problem, because you can record only one track at a
time.
Another example: You’re recording a large vocal group, and the group is too
large to all sing into a single microphone.
In these cases, the answer is to use a small mixing board. A mixing board has
inputs and outputs so that you can, for example, connect four microphones
to four different input channels; adjust their level, equalization, tone, pan,
effects, and so on; and then send that mixed signal to a single output (which
would be fed to GarageBand).
You know the big sound board that you find out in the middle of the floor at
a rock concert? That’s nothing more than a big, expensive mixing board that
obtains input from the microphones on the stage and sends output to the
giant speakers on either side of the stage.
Guitar Center sells a wide variety of mixing boards. I bought a small
Behringer mixer with eight in ports and two out ports for under $100,
and a couple of even smaller ones were available for a bit less money.
292
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Chapter 7 includes information written by my drummer buddy Dave Hamilton
that concludes that a mixer is almost a “must-have” for GarageBand drummers.
Switch to More Powerful Software
If the previous section sounded good to you — and you’re interested in record-
ing multiple instruments or vocals on multiple tracks, all at the same time —
you need more powerful software than GarageBand. Examples include pro
audio recording applications such as Apple’s Logic Express ($299) or Logic
Pro ($999), or DigiDesign’s Pro Tools.
The software expense will be the least of your worries if you decide to assem-
ble a semipro or pro-quality home studio. For starters, you’ll need a multi-
channel audio interface or two. Then, you’ll want at least one microphone
for each channel. You may want to dedicate a very fast Mac with very fast
hard drives, and use it for recording only.
But I digress.
Logic Express or Logic Pro
In addition to GarageBand, Apple makes two excellent professional-quality
music creation programs that go by the name Logic. Logic Express is the
entry-level version; it sells for the reasonable price of $299. Logic Pro is just
what the name implies — a professional-quality application with an equally
professional price of $999.
The Express version packs a lot of bang for the buck but it intentionally lacks
some of the high-end features found in Logic Pro. For example, you can only
record 12 channels at a time using Logic Express while Logic Pro can record
as many as your Mac can handle. Logic Pro records at resolutions up to 192k
while Express maxes out at a respectable 96k. And, as you’d expect, Logic Pro
includes more plug-ins (53 versus 28 at last count) and instruments, and sup-
ports 5.1 and 7.1 surround sound formats.
The truth is that either program will produce radio-quality music. Still, unless
you absolutely know you’ll need one of the Pro features, start out with Express.
It uses the same file format and offers the same user interface as the Pro ver-
sion, so everything you do and learn will apply if you decide you need to
upgrade to Logic Pro. But in the meantime, you’re $700 richer.
293
Chapter 17: Ten Ways to Take Your Recordings to the Next Level

There’s no reason songs you create with GarageBand can’t be radio-worthy,
though you’d probably want to have them mastered by a pro before press-
ing CDs.
Pro Tools
Pro Tools is worth consideration because DigiDesign offers multiple versions
of it at a wide variety of prices, and all versions are compatible with each other.
This means that you can start out with the least expensive version and con-
tinue to work with the same song files on any of the more expensive versions
of Pro Tools. The least expensive version, which is included with the Mbox
hardware audio interface, is Pro Tools LE. The hardware/software combina-
tion sells for around $450 and is a screaming deal if you plan to use Pro Tools.
And, of course, the audio interface works with GarageBand as well. For addi-
tional details about Mbox, see Chapter 2.

I
f you’re producing songs, you can find a handful of extremely useful sites
on the Web for obtaining anything from cables to microphones and MIDI
files to song lyrics. Here are a few of the best.
General Audio and Recording Sites
In no particular order, here are the URLs and brief descriptions of some non-
Mac-specific Web sites that you may find useful.
Tab Robot
www.tabrobot.com
Tab Robot is a search engine for guitar tablature and chords for popular
songs. You can search by band name or song name, and you’ll get hits for
most popular songs.
Tablature is a special form of musical notation that’s used for guitar parts. It
can be typed on a computer and is usually displayed in a monospaced font
such as Courier. A guitar riff in tab notation is shown in Figure 18-1.
You read the tablature from left to right. The numbers tell you what fret to
play, and the line that the number is on tells you which string to play it on.
There’s no better way to learn a song than to have chords or tablature in
front of you. If you want to learn new songs, start here.

MIDI Explorer
www.musicrobot.com
MIDI Explorer is to MIDI files what Tab Robot is to guitar tabs and chord
charts: It’s a search engine for MIDI files. You can search by artist or song,
and you usually find at least one arrangement of most popular songs. After
you’ve downloaded the MIDI files, you can listen to them using QuickTime
Player or you can use Dent du Midi (discussed in the section about using
Dent du Midi for GarageBand karaoke in Chapter 15) to turn them into files
that you can import into GarageBand and modify to your heart’s content. If
you’re trying to record a favorite song, the GarageBand karaoke trick may
be the fastest way to get from blank screen to finished tune.
Mix
www.mixonline.com
This is the online home of Mix magazine, the magazine of “Professional Audio
and Music Production.” The site is chock-full of useful information, including
reviews of products for your studio and tutorials on many aspects of recording.
You find little (or no) GarageBand-specific information here, but the products
and tutorials apply to GarageBand users as well as pros. Some of the articles
may be too technical for some readers, but if you’re interested in knowing
more about how the pros do it and the tools that they use, Mix can give you
the dish.

EQ
www.eqmag.com
EQ is “Defining the Future of Recording.” It’s got product reviews, newsletters,
classified advertising, useful links, and forums for users, with more informa-
tion for the semipro and prosumer than Mix does.
Electronic Musician
www.emusician.com
Electronic Musician magazine is slightly different from Mix or EQ — it’s aimed at
musicians who use computers for playing or recording. Mix and EQ are aimed
squarely at audio producers, without regard for whether they play. Because
of Electronic Musician’s exclusive focus on computers and electronic devices,
GarageBand users can find a lot of information here. For example, you’re more
likely to find information about plug-ins for GarageBand (and other Mac OS X
Audio Units hosts) here than at most other sites. You can also find more infor-
mation about instrument-related items — such as guitar simulators and effects,
synthesizers and other keyboard instruments, and virtual instruments — on
the Electronic Musician site than you do at most others.
If you’re even half-serious about doing cool things with your Mac, you should
definitely check out this site.
Sweetwater Sound
www.sweetwater.com
Sweetwater Sound is more than just an online audio dealer. Sweetwater Sound
is also a huge state-of-the-art commercial recording studio. The salespeople
put the gear into use in a real studio and can tell you whether something
does or doesn’t work. The site is chock-full of excellent information about
the products it sells, and its product selection is second to none. The site
offers downloadable gear guides and informative free e-newsletters, and
it has a very reasonable return policy.
Sweetwater Sound is the first site that I go to when I’m shopping for
something — and it’s the site where I usually end up making my 
purchase.
297
Chapter 18: Ten Useful Web Sites

Musician’s Friend
www.musiciansfriend.com
If Sweetwater is number one, Musician’s Friend is surely a strong number
two. With a fantastic selection of instruments and recording gear, and lots
of closeouts and other killer deals, this is another site that you should not
miss if you’re shopping for gear.
Look at both sites before you buy. One time I wanted an M-Audio Oxygen 8
keyboard. It was the same price at both sites, but Sweetwater was throwing
in a carrying bag at no additional cost. I’ve seen the same thing happen with
Musician’s Friend, where it was bundling an item that Sweetwater wasn’t.
It pays to visit at least two or three vendor sites before you reach for your
wallet.
Mac- or GarageBand-Oriented Sites
The following sites are ones that focus on using a Mac to make music — 
or on GarageBand itself.
Apple GarageBand discussion board
http://discussions.info.apple.com/webx/garageband/
If you have a question about how to do something in GarageBand, this is the
place to get an answer. It’s a discussion board that’s hosted by Apple and it’s
full of questions and answers by both Apple staffers and other GarageBand
users like you and me. Here are some recent topics:
 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
 GarageBand Compatibility List
 Creating loops with the Soundtrack Loop utility
 Recording multiple tracks in GarageBand
 Can you run GarageBand from a FireWire drive?
 Making new instruments
 Exporting tracks to Logic Pro or Logic Express
You can find hundreds of other GarageBand-related topics, and the boards
seem to get a lot of traffic, so many questions are answered the same day
that they’re posted.

If you post a message, don’t forget to come back to the site the next day (or
every day for a few days) to read the replies and thank the helpful posters.
You may want to bookmark the page that contains your message so that you
can find it quickly when you return.
OS X Audio
www.osxaudio.com
OS X Audio bills itself as “The Ultimate Mac OS X Audio Resource,” and that’s
probably true. OS X Audio doesn’t sell stuff — the main attraction is a near-
encyclopedic listing of Mac OS X audio products broken into several dozen
categories, including the following:
 Applications: Audio Utilities
 Applications: Audio/Sequencer
 Applications: Drivers
 Applications: Live Performance
 Applications: Midi Utilities
 Applications: Recorder/Editor
 Applications: Synth/Sampler
 Article: Audio Tips
 Hardware: Audio Interfaces
 Hardware: FireWire Audio
 Hardware: Input Devices
 Hardware: Keyboards
 Hardware: Midi Interfaces
 Hardware: USB Audio
For most products, you can find a list of features and the system requirements,
at the very least. For some products, you’ll find pages of info and comments
from other users. You can also find an excellent discussion board that covers
broader audio-related issues than the Apple board that I mentioned in the
previous section.
If you want to know more about an audio product for OS X or if a product
exists that does something in particular, this may be the best place to look

feature standpoint, it’s got the usual stuff — forums, a buyer’s guide, a resource
library, news, and lots of GarageBand compositions as well. If you’re interested
in how others are using GarageBand, visit MacJams often.
The Mac Observer’s GarageBand
Garage forum
www.macobserver.com/forums/viewforum.php?f=37
I write a column every other week for The MacObserver, and we’ve started our
own discussion board forum for GarageBand users. We call it the GarageBand
Garage, and I stop by as often as I can.
The forum is moderated by the extremely GarageBand-savvy Bryan Chaffin —
who also happens to be this book’s tech editor and an all-around great guy.
