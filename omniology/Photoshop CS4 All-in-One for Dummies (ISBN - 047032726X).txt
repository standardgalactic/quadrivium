Introduction
T
here’s a reason why Photoshop is the world’s industry standard in 
image-editing software. The depth and breadth of the program is unher-
alded. Photoshop immediately sucks you in with its easy-to-use interface 
and powerful tools and commands. It’s so feature rich that you soon begin 
to lose track of time and start blowing off your commitments just to try one 
more thing. And just when you think you’ve finally explored every nook 
and cranny and mastered the program, you suddenly read a tip in a book 
or magazine that enlightens you about something you didn’t know. Or even 
more likely, you stumble upon some great effect while working on a late-
night project. That’s the beauty of Photoshop. It’s the program that just 
keeps giving.
The depth and breadth of Photoshop has downsides, too, of course. You 
must make a major time commitment and invest much effort to master 
it — hence the large number of books written on the program. Walk into 
your neighborhood bookstore or type Photoshop in the Search field at any 
online bookseller’s site, and you see a barrage of choices. Some books are 
general reference books, some are targeted toward the novice user, and 
others focus on a specific mission, such as color management or restoration 
and retouching.
About This Book
This book is written for the person who has a good grasp of using a com-
puter and navigating the operating system and at least a cursory knowledge 
of Photoshop. It is intended to be a comprehensive reference book that you 
can read cover to cover or reach for when you’re looking for specific infor-
mation about a particular task.
Wherever I can, I sneak in a useful tip or an interesting technique to help 
you put Photoshop to work for your project needs.
Sometimes, knowing how to use a tool doesn’t necessarily mean that you 
know what to do with it. That’s why this book contains several Putting It 
Together exercises that help you make a connection between the multiple 
Photoshop tools at your disposal and the very specific task you need to 
accomplish. Want to get the red out of a subject’s eyes or create a collage? 

2
What’s in This Book
Just check out the Putting It Together sections in Books III through IX. These 
sections present info in easy-to-follow numbered steps, in a hands-on style, 
building on what’s presented in the chapter so that you can go to the next 
level, put concepts to work, and move on to the next task.
 
You can find images that appear within the Putting It Together sections on 
this book’s companion Web site (www.dummies.com/go/photoshopcs4), 
so you can follow along precisely with the steps. 
What’s in This Book
This book is broken into minibooks, each covering a general topic. Each 
minibook contains several chapters, each covering a more specific topic 
under the general one. Each chapter is then divided into sections, and some 
of those sections have subsections. I’m sure you get the picture.
You can read the book from front to back, or you can dive right into the mini-
book or chapter of your choice. Either way works just fine. Anytime a concept 
is mentioned that isn’t covered in depth in that chapter, you find a cross-
reference to another book and chapter where you find all the details. If you’re 
looking for something specific, check out either the Table of Contents or 
the Index.
The Cheat Sheet at the beginning of the book helps you remember all the 
shortcuts you’ll use most often. Tear it out, tape it to your monitor, and 
glance over it when you need to.
And finally, I have pictures. Lots of them. In full, living color. Many of these 
pictures have callouts that point to specific steps or identify important con-
cepts, buttons, tools, or options. With a program like Photoshop, an image 
often speaks louder than words. 
This book contains nine minibooks. The following sections offer a quick syn-
opsis of what each book contains.
Book I: Photoshop Fundamentals
Ready to get your feet wet with the basics of Photoshop? Head to Book I. 
Here’s where you get familiar with the Photoshop environment — the desk-
top, menus, and panels. I also briefly introduce the key tools and explain 
what each one does.
 
Photoshop has such an abundance of tools — and so many ways to use 
those tools — I can’t possibly cover them all in this book. But if you’re look-
ing for details on the less commonly used features or perhaps more informa-
tion about using tools you’re already familiar with, you’ll find them on this 
book’s companion Web site (www.dummies.com/go/photoshopcs4). 

3
What’s in This Book
In this book, I cover how to get started on Photoshop and how to view and 
navigate your image window. Here’s also where I give you all the important 
details about the o’mighty Adobe Bridge and how to customize your work-
space and preference settings. 
Finally, I go into the bare basics of printing, and then how to save files and 
close Photoshop.
Book II: Image Essentials
This book covers all those nitpicky — but critical — details about images, 
such as size, resolution, pixel dimension, image mode, and file format. Turn 
to this book to find out how to safely resize your image without causing 
undue damage. 
You can also find out how to crop images and increase their canvas size. In 
addition, I breeze through basic color theory and get you started using and 
managing color.
But wait, there’s more. I give you the lowdown on the History panel and 
brushing and erasing to history. And, if that’s not enough, I throw in a chap-
ter on using and creating actions for enhanced productivity.
Book III: Selections
This important book gives you all the juicy details and techniques on creat-
ing and modifying selections and paths. You find out about each of the selec-
tion tools and also the powerful — albeit sometimes unruly — Pen tool and 
its accompanying Paths panel.
Book IV: Painting, Drawing, and Typing
If you want to know about the drawing and painting tools, this book is for 
you. Here I cover the Brush and Pencil tools, along with the multifaceted 
Brushes panel. I also show you how to create vector shapes by using the 
shape tools, and how to fill and stroke selections. 
Head to this book to find out how to create both gradients and patterns and, 
last but not least, become familiar with the type tools and how to use them 
to create and edit standard type, type on and in a path, and type with special 
effects.
Book V: Working with Layers
Layers are an integral component in a Photoshop image, and Book V is 
where I explain them. In this book, you discover how to create and edit 

4
What’s in This Book
layers and how to use multiple images to create a multilayered composite 
image. You find out various ways to manage layers for maximum efficiency, 
including using the Layer Comps panel. I also show you how to enhance 
layers by applying different blend modes, opacity settings, layer styles, 
and styles. I round out the minibook by covering Smart Objects. And finally, 
I introduce you to working with the Auto Align and Auto Blend features.
Book VI: Channels and Masks
This book gives you all the how-tos you need to work with channels and 
masks. I show you how to save and edit selections as alpha channels so 
that you can reload them later. And I show you how to work with the vari-
ous kinds of masks — quick masks, layer masks, and channel masks — and 
how you can use each to select difficult elements. I also cover other masking 
techniques, such as erasing and using the Color Range command. Finally, I 
introduce you to the new Masks panel, a powerful addition to the masking 
arsenal.
Book VII: Filters and Distortions
I filled this book with tons of handy tips and techniques on using filters 
to correct your images to make them sharper, blurrier, cleaner, and 
smoother — whatever fits your fancy. I give you the scoop on the Smart 
Filters feature, which enables you to apply filters nondestructively. You 
also find out how to use filters to give your image a certain special effect, 
such as a deckled edge or water droplets. Finally, I introduce the Liquify 
command so that you can see the wonder of its distortion tools — and how 
they can turn your image into digital taffy. 
Book VIII: Retouching and Restoration
You find everything you need to know about color correction or color 
enhancement in Book VIII — getting rid of colorcasts, improving contrast 
and saturation, remapping, and replacing colors.
In addition, I include a chapter on using the focus and toning tools to manu-
ally lighten, darken, smooth, soften, and sharpen areas of your image. You 
get to see how you can use the Clone Stamp tool, the Healing tools, and the 
Red Eye tool to fix flaws and imperfections in your images, making them 
good as new. I also show you the Color Replacement tool and how to replace 
your image’s original color with the foreground color. Finally, you get some 
tidbits on how to work with the fascinating Vanishing Point feature, which 
can make editing and compositing images a whole lot easier.

Conventions Used in This Book
Book IX: Photoshop and Print
This book gives you the lowdown on preparing your images for print. You find 
details on how to get the right resolution, image mode, and file format. You 
also discover how to set up both process and spot color separations for those 
offset print jobs. 
About the Web Site
For those Web graphics, you find lots of great bonus chapter material on this 
book’s companion Web site (www.dummies.com/go/photoshopcs4). Find 
out how to optimize your images for maximum quality and quick download 
times. You also find information on slicing and animating your images and 
creating a photo gallery that you can easily post on the Web. 
Conventions Used in This Book
You’ll find that this book is cross-platform. Windows commands are given 
first, followed by Mac commands in parentheses, like this:
Press Enter (or Return on the Mac) to begin a new line.
And occasionally, text is specific to one platform or another. You’ll find that 
figures are divided into both platforms as well.
Often the commands given involve using the keyboard along with the mouse. 
For example, “Press Shift while dragging with the Rectangular Marquee tool 
to create a square,” or “Alt-click (Option-click) on the eyeball to redisplay all 
layers.”
When you see a command arrow (➪) in the text, it indicates to select a com-
mand from the menu bar. For example, “choose Edit➪Define Custom Shape” 
means to click the Edit menu and then choose the Define Custom Shape 
command.
This book has been written using Photoshop CS4 and, more specifically, the, 
Standard version. Despite that fact, you can still glean valuable info if you’re 
using Version CS3 or CS2. It may take a little more time to understand how 
a panel or options have changed, and of course, the topics covering new 
features won’t be applicable. Speaking of new features, when writing this 
book, it wasn’t exactly crystal clear what new CS4 features Adobe would 
be including in the Standard versus Extended versions of Photoshop. So if 
I’ve included (or not) a particular tool or command that you don’t have, my 
apologies in advance.

Icons Used in This Book
While perusing this book, you’ll notice some icons beckoning you for your 
attention. Don’t ignore them; embrace them! These icons point out fun, 
useful, and memorable tidbits about Photoshop, plus facts you’d be unwise 
to ignore.
 
Seasoned users will appreciate this icon, which kindly points out new fea-
tures introduced in Photoshop CS4.
 
This icon indicates information that makes your Photoshop experience 
easier. It also gives you an icebreaker at your next cocktail party. Whipping 
out, “Did you know that pressing the bracket keys enlarges or shrinks your 
brush tip?” is bound to make you the center of conversation.
 
This icon is a reminder of things that I already mentioned and want to gently 
re-emphasize. Or I might be pointing out things that I want you to take note 
of in your future Photoshop excursions.
 
The little bomb icon is a red flag. Heed these warnings, or else Photoshop 
may show its ugly side.
 
This icon marks eggheady graphics or Photoshop info that goes beyond the 
basics.

Book I
Photoshop 
Fundamentals

D
on’t know where to start? Well, unless you 
have a burning question on something very 
specific, this is a great place to dive in. And I 
promise you won’t flounder. There’s nothing like a 
general overview to get you feeling confident 
enough to tackle more sophisticated features.
In this book, I introduce you to the Photoshop envi-
ronment with all its components, from the desktop 
to the many panels. I show you each of the 70 tools 
and briefly explain what each tool does. From 
there, I show you how to open existing files or cre-
ate new ones and then how to save and print those 
files, as well as how to view and navigate around 
your image window. In that same chapter, I give 
you details on using Adobe Bridge, a powerful 
browser and file management tool. Finally, I explain 
how to customize your workspace and preferences 
so you can tailor Photoshop to better suit your per-
sonal image-editing needs and interests. I guarantee 
you won’t find a more accommodating image editor 
around.

Chapter 1: Examining the 
Photoshop Environment
In This Chapter
✓ Starting Photoshop
✓ Working with panels
✓ Examining the Photoshop desktop
✓ Investigating the Menu bar and the Options bar
✓ Discovering the new Application bar
A
s environments go, the Photoshop working environment is pretty cool: 
as inviting as a landscaped backyard and not nearly as likely to work 
you into a sweat. Each of the many tools in Photoshop is custom-
designed for a specific chore — and chock-full of more 
options than a Swiss Army knife. When you’re familiar 
with your surroundings, you’ll be eager to make like 
Monet in his garden, surrounded by panels, brushes, 
buckets of paint, and swatches of color, ready to 
tackle the canvas in front of you.
Launching Photoshop and 
Customizing the Desktop
You start Photoshop just as you launch any other 
program with Windows or the Mac OS. Like with 
other programs, you can choose the method you find 
the easiest and most convenient. In Windows, you can 
launch programs from the Start menu or an icon on the task-
bar. In Mac OS X, you may have a Photoshop icon on the Dock. In 
either Windows or Mac OS X, you can double-click a Photoshop shortcut or 
alias icon if you have one on your desktop. Finally, you can double-click an 
image associated with Photoshop, which then launches Photoshop along 
with the file.

10
Launching Photoshop and Customizing the Desktop
When you launch Photoshop, the desktop workspace, shown in Figure 1-1, 
appears. Like the real-world desktop where your keyboard and monitor 
reside, the Photoshop desktop is a place for you to put all the images you’re 
working with.
Options bar
Document window
Dock
Panels
Tools panel
Status bar
Figure 1-1: The Photoshop desktop consists of many components, including an image 
document window, panels, and bars.
Within the main Photoshop window, you see a variety of other windows and 
boxes, such as the image document window that enables you to view and 
edit images. The main window contains the stuff you’re probably used to 
seeing in other programs — a title bar at the top of the window, a status bar 
at the bottom (unless you have it turned off) if you’re a Windows user, and 
menus to help you execute commands and get important information about 
your image files. But the arrangement of controls may be a little unfamiliar 
to you. Photoshop arranges controls into groups called panels.

Launching Photoshop and Customizing the Desktop
Your virtual desktop can become as cluttered as the real thing, but Adobe 
has built in some special features (located on the Options bar, which I 
discuss later in this chapter) that let you keep stuff close at hand but tuck 
things away so they’re not constantly underfoot (or under-mouse, so to 
speak). After you arrange your Photoshop desktop just as you like it for a 
specific project, you can even save the desktop and reuse it whenever you 
work on that project (see Book I, Chapter 5 for details).
Every document you ever work on appears within the confines of the image 
document window and can’t leave its borders. You can move around some 
other components, such as the various panels and the Options bar, both 
inside and outside the Photoshop application window.
The following sections show you how to customize the main working area so 
you can get to work.
Setting display settings with the Window menu
The Window menu, shown in Figure 1-2, controls the display 
of panels and some other elements of the Photoshop working 
area. (Find out more about maneuvering panels in the section 
“Playing with Panels,” later in this chapter.)
The top two entries on the Window menu enable you to con-
trol the display arrangement of your open documents and 
manage your workspaces.
On the Window➪Arrange submenu, you can tell Photoshop 
to cascade (stack) or tile (butt edge to edge) all open docu-
ments.Note that your images must be floating in their win-
dows to enable this option (Window➪Arrange➪Float All in 
Windows).
 
Photoshop CS4 now comes with what’s referred to as an 
Application Frame. Open documents are tabbed together 
neatly, one stacked behind the other. If you yearn for the old 
days and want your images to float within the application, 
choose the new Float in Window (for the currently selected 
image only) and Float All in Windows (for all your images) 
commands in the Arrange submenu.
Table 1-1 gives you the lowdown about the other options on 
the Window➪Arrange submenu.
The remaining bulk of the Window menu contains a list of 
panels in alphabetical order, as well as currently open 
documents.

What It Does
Consolidate All to Tabs
Takes all your open “floating” documents and tabs 
them together under the Options bar.
Match Zoom
Takes all your open documents and matches the 
magnification percentage of your currently active 
document.
Match Location
Takes all your open documents and matches the loca-
tion of your currently active document. For example, 
if you’re viewing the lower-left corner of your active 
document and choose Match Location, all your open 
documents are also displayed from the lower-left 
corner.
Match Rotation
Takes all your open documents and matches the 
canvas rotation of your currently active document.
Match All
Employs all Match commands simultaneously.
New Window
Opens another view of the same image, allowing you 
to work on a close-up of part of the image while view-
ing results on the entire image.
Minimize (Mac only)
Hides the image while placing the image’s thumbnail 
on the Dock. Click the thumbnail to restore the image 
in Photoshop.
Bring All to Front 
(Mac only) 
If you have multiple applications launched and 
document windows open, this command brings all 
Photoshop documents to the front, ahead of any open 
document windows from other applications.
Setting up the status bar
Each Photoshop document window comes equipped with a status bar. Many 
people tend to associate status with wealth, so I think there’s a good reason 
to accept the free wealth of information that the status bar offers:
 
✓ On the far left of the bar is a box that displays an active image’s current 
zoom level (such as 33.33%). Incidentally, the title bar of the document 
itself also shows the zoom level.
 
 
If you installed Photoshop to a networked computer and you activate 
the workgroup features, which enable file sharing and other perks, you 
see the icon for the Workgroup Services pop-up menu just to the right of 
the zoom-info box.
 
✓ To the right of the zoom level is the display area for file and image infor-
mation — which, by default, shows the document size. (You can custom-
ize this area to display other information.)

Because Photoshop files can get pretty hefty in size, your status bar shows 
the file size of the active image by default. To display other types of informa-
tion, click the right-pointing arrow in the status bar, choose Show, and 
select one of the following options from the menu that pops up (as shown 
in Figure 1-3):
Corbis Digital Stock
Figure 1-3: The status bar provides a wealth of vital information about your image.
 
✓ Versions: If you’re a Version Cue user, you can select this option, which 
allows you to select other versions of your file. For example, you may 
want to select a version with comments or one with a specific version 
date. Versions provide a good way of storing work that was executed in 
different stages. At each progress point, you can save a version of that 
file, thereby creating a snapshot of the file at that point in time.
 
 What’s Version Cue? It’s a program (which works across all Creative Suite 
applications) designed to increase productivity in a collaborative environ-
ment. Version Cue identifies and organizes files into projects. You can have 
various versions and alternates of the same project file. It also provides file 
security, file status, and allows for commenting by multiple users.
 
✓ Reveal in Bridge: This command transports you to the Adobe Bridge — 
where it then physically locates your active image, wherever it resides 
on your system.

14
Launching Photoshop and Customizing the Desktop
 
✓ Version Cue: If you have Version Cue enabled, Photoshop displays 
Version Cue information, such as if another user is using the file.
 
✓ Document Sizes: When you select this option, Photoshop displays two 
numbers to approximate the size of the image. The first number shows 
you the size of the file if you were to flatten (combine) all the layers into 
one and save it to your hard drive in the native Photoshop file format. 
The number on the right shows the size of the file, including layers, 
channels, and other components, and how much data Photoshop has to 
juggle while you’re working on the file. You want this option active when 
you need to keep track of how large your image is.
 
✓ Document Profile: When you select this option, the status bar displays 
the name of the color profile that the image uses, as well as the number 
of bits per channel. You probably won’t use this option unless you need 
to know the profiles of all the open documents while making complex 
color corrections. (You can find more information about profiles in Book 
II, Chapter 3.)
 
✓ Document Dimensions: When you select this option, the status bar 
shows you the size of the image by using the default measurement incre-
ment you’ve set in Photoshop’s Preferences (pixels, inches, picas, and 
so on). You might need this information for instant reference to the 
physical dimensions of your open files. For information on setting pref-
erences in Photoshop, see Book I, Chapter 5.
 
✓ Scratch Sizes: Scratch space is the virtual memory set aside on your 
hard drive to simulate RAM and make editing large files easier. Enabling 
this option shows two measurements for an active image. On the left, 
you see the amount of real memory and virtual memory that all open 
images are using. On the right, you see the total amount of RAM avail-
able for working with images. Photoshop needs a lot more memory and 
disk space to work on an image while that image is open, and that’s 
what’s shown by the Scratch Sizes display, as opposed to the Document 
Size display that shows only the file size of the document itself.
 
✓ Efficiency: This indicator helps you gauge whether you really have 
enough RAM to perform a task. It shows the percentage of time 
Photoshop spends actually working on an operation, compared to the 
time it must spend reading or writing image information to or from your 
hard disk. If the value dips below 100 percent most of the time, you need 
to allocate more memory to Photoshop (if you’re using a PC). For more 
information on parceling out RAM, see Book I, Chapter 5.
 
✓ Timing: This number shows you how long it took you to complete your 
most recent incredible feat.
 
✓ Current Tool: This option shows you the name of the tool currently in use.
 
✓ 32-Bit Exposure: This option is for adjusting the preview image for view-
ing 32-bit High Dynamic Range (HDR) images. The slider control is avail-
able only if you have an HDR image open. Book IX covers HDR.

Playing with Panels
Playing with Panels
Many image-oriented programs use panels of a sort, and Photoshop itself 
has had panels (formerly called palettes) since version 1.0 (released in 
January 1990). However, since Photoshop 3.0, the program has used a novel 
way of working with panels. Rather than standalone windows, Photoshop 
uses grouped, tabbed panels, which overlap each other in groups of two 
or three (or more, if you rearrange them yourself). To access a panel that 
falls behind the one displayed on top, click the panel’s tab. By default, some 
panels, such as Tool Presets, appear alone.
Panels may contain sliders, but-
tons, drop-down lists, pop-up 
menus (as shown in Figure 1-4), 
and other controls. You also 
find icons at the bottom of many 
panels. For example, at the base 
of the Layers panel are com-
mand icons that let you create a 
new layer, add a layer style, or 
trash a layer that you no longer 
want. Many panels — such as 
the Brushes, Styles, Actions, and 
Colors panels — include options 
for defining sets of parameters 
(called presets) that you can 
store for reuse at any time.
In Version CS3, Adobe revamped 
the look and feel of panels across 
all their Creative Suite applica-
tions and started to refer to them 
as icon panels. Whatever name 
you call them, they still hold 
the same information. They’re 
just more streamlined and 
can be easily tucked away and 
expanded, as needed. By default, 
the panels are anchored in the 
top-right by a multitiered Dock.

Playing with Panels
Here’s how to open, close, and otherwise manipulate a panel group from the 
Window menu:
 
✓ To expand a panel: Panels are represented by icons when collapsed. 
To expand a panel, simply click its icon. You can also select a panel by 
choosing it in the Window menu.
 
✓ To bring a panel to the front of its group: When the panel group is 
expanded, the panel that’s visible is the panel that has a check mark 
next to it on the Window menu. In this mode, you can select only one 
panel in any group because only one tab in a group can be on top at 
one time. When you select a panel from the Window menu, you have no 
way of knowing which panels are grouped together because Adobe lists 
panels alphabetically, rather than by groups. To bring a specific panel to 
the front, click its tab (when expanded) or icon (when collapsed).
 
✓ To move a panel out of its group: Grab the panel’s tab with your mouse 
and drag it to its new location, such as another group, into the Dock, 
or the Photoshop desktop. If you move the panels out of their groups 
or drag them onto the desktop so they stand alone, any of them can be 
check-marked in the Window menu.
 
✓ To collapse a panel: Click the gray blank area next to the tab.
 
✓ To close a panel: Select a check-marked panel in the Window menu. 
Note that the whole panel group closes. You can also select Close or 
Close Tab Group from the panel’s pop-up menu.
Here are some more panel-manipulation tips:
 
✓ Expand or collapse the Dock. To do so, click on the double triangles at 
the top of the Dock.
 
✓ Reduce a panel to its icon. Drag the panel by its tab and position it 
below the existing column of icons. Release your mouse button to make 
the panel collapse down to its corresponding icon.
 
✓ Save space by keeping panels in groups. You can drag all the panels in 
a group by dragging the gray blank area to the right of the group’s tab. 
Access an individual panel by clicking its tab to bring it to the front. As a 
result, several panels occupy the screen space required by only one.
 
✓ Use the Window menu if you can’t find a panel. On the Window menu, 
select the panel’s name to make it visible or to bring it to the top of its 
group.
 
✓ Customize, customize, customize. After you use Photoshop for a while, 
creating your own custom panel groups based on the panels you most 
often use can be a real timesaver. For example, if you don’t use the Paths 
panel very often but can’t live without the Actions panel, you can drag 
the Paths panel to another group or to to the panel dock area, and put 

17
Book I
Chapter 1
Examining the 
Photoshop 
Environment
Working with Your First Photoshop File
the Actions panel in the same group as the mission-critical Layers and 
Channels panels.
 
✓ Restore default panel locations, when desired. If you decide you 
don’t like the way you’ve arranged your panels, you can choose 
Window➪Workspace➪Essentials (Default) to return them to the default 
configuration (the way they were when Photoshop was installed).
 
Many panels (for example, the Swatches and Character panels) allow you 
to reset the settings back to their defaults. To do so, select Reset from the 
panel’s pop-up menu located in the top-right corner.
Working with Your First Photoshop File
So many menus, so little time! The second you begin working with Photoshop, 
you may be convinced that Adobe’s flagship image editor has somewhere on 
the order of 8,192 different menu selections for you to choose from. In truth, 
Photoshop has only about 500-plus separate menu items, including some 
that are duplicated. That figure doesn’t count the 100 or so entries for filter 
plug-ins (which can expand alarmingly when you add third-party goodies). 
However, even 500-plus menu items are considerably more than you find in 
the most ambitious restaurants. Basically, if you want to do something in 
Photoshop, you need to use the Menu bar (or its equivalent command snug-
gled within a panel menu). If you’re using the Mac OS, the Photoshop Menu 
bar may share space with Finder components (such as the Apple menu).
The following sections offer a summary of what you can find and where you 
can find it.
 
Photoshop also helps you by providing efficient context menus, which 
change their listings depending on what you’re doing. You don’t see options 
you don’t need, and do see options appropriate to what you’re working on. 
Right-click (Control-click on the Mac) to bring up the menu.
Opening, printing, and saving files
The File menu offers a cornucopia of file options, from opening new images 
and opening saved files to browsing existing files, closing files, and saving 
files. You find the page setup, preview, and printing commands, too. To open 
a file, choose File➪Open and navigate to the folder containing the file you 
want to open. Select the file and click Open. For detailed instructions on all 
the many different ways you can open files, see Book I, Chapter 3.
 
If you double-click anywhere in the gray empty area of the Photoshop 
window, the Open dialog box pops up — so you can navigate to a file you 
want to work on without wandering up to the File menu, using the Ctrl+O 
keyboard shortcut, or using Adobe Bridge.

18
Working with Your First Photoshop File
Making selections
Selections let you work with only part of an image. You can select an entire 
layer or only portions of a layer with one of the selection tools, such as the 
Marquee or Magic Wand tool. The Select menu offers several commands to 
modify your selection — from capturing more pixels to softening the edges 
of the selection. The Select menu (shown in Figure 1-5) is short and sweet, 
but the capability and control that the menu unleashes is nothing short of an 
image-editing miracle.
Understanding selections is such an important cornerstone to your 
Photoshop knowledge that I devote an entire minibook (Book III) to showing 
you how to use them.
Making simple image edits
The Edit menu contains tools that enable you to cut, copy, or paste image 
selections in several different ways. You can fill selections or stroke their 
outlines (create a line along their edges), which I explain in more detail in 
Book IV, Chapter 2. And you can use this menu to rotate, resize, distort, or 
perform other transformations (changes in size or shape) on your selections 
(see Book III, Chapter 3). You can undo the change you made in Photoshop, 
fade a filter, check your spelling, or find and replace text.

your selections.

Adjusting size, color, and contrast
You’d think the Image menu (shown in Figure 1-6) might have something to 
do with making changes to an image document as a whole, wouldn’t you? In 
practice, some of the entries you find here do apply to the whole document, 
but others can apply just to particular layers or selections.
For example, the Mode menu item allows you to change an entire image from 
color to grayscale. The Image Size, Canvas Size, Image Rotation, Crop, and 
Trim selections all change the whole document in some way. On the other 
hand, you can only apply the changes wrought from the Adjustments sub-
menu to an entire image if the document consists of only a background and 
has no layers. If the document has more than one layer, then adjustments 
such as Color Balance, Hue/Saturation, or Levels work only with a single 
layer or a selection on that layer.
Figure 1-6: The Image menu is where you find commands for adjusting the size, color, and 
contrast of your image.

20
Working with Your First Photoshop File
The Variables and Apply Data Set commands are reserved for working 
with data-driven graphics. Briefly, data-driven graphics make it possible to 
quickly produce multiple versions of an image for print and Web projects. 
Multiple versions allow for target audience customization for projects such 
as direct mail pieces. For example, you can base hundreds of versions of a 
brochure or Web banner on a single template. The Variables define which 
elements in a template change. A Data Set is a collection of variables and 
associated data.
 
You’ll find yourself turning to the Image menu more often than many of the 
other menus, partially because it’s so useful and partially because, for some 
reason, many of the options don’t have keyboard shortcuts that let you 
bypass the menu.
Creating layers
Layers give you a way of stacking portions of an image — like sheets of 
acetate — on top of one another so that you can work on individual pieces 
separately. Then, when you’re satisfied with your changes, you can either 
combine the changes into a final image or leave them in layers for maximum 
editing flexibility.
The Photoshop Layers feature, which gets an entire book of its own (Book 
V), lets you create new and duplicate layers, delete one or several layers, 
change layer properties (such as a layer’s name), or add special features, 
such as drop shadows or beveled edges, to objects in a layer. You can also 
create special kinds of layers to make adjustments or mask out portions 
of an image. The menu has selections for changing the order of the layers 
(moving a specific layer to the front or top of the stack, and so on) and 
grouping layers. Figure 1-7 shows an image that has three layers: The first 
layer is the symphony image, the second layer is the instrument, and the 
third layer contains the type.
You also can merge layers down, combine them with all other visible layers, 
or flatten them into one single-layer image (or background). Although con-
solidating your layers makes the file smaller, flattening is irreversible after 
you close the file. Storing an unflattened version of a file is always a good 
idea in case you want to make more changes later on.
Applying filters
A filter is an effect that changes an entire layer, channel, or selection. Some 
common filters include the Blur and Sharpen filters, as well as the Distort 
filters, such as Spherize. The Filter menu, shown in Figure 1-8, consists 

21
Book I
Chapter 1
Examining the 
Photoshop 
Environment
Working with Your First Photoshop File
almost entirely of cascading categories of image-transmogrifying plug-ins. 
You can wade through this menu to find the perfect effect to apply to 
an image or selection. Book VII has everything you need to know about 
filters.
After you apply a filter, Photoshop copies the filter command to the top of 
the Filter menu for easy accessibility, in case you want to reapply the filter 
with the exact same settings.
The Filter Gallery command allows you to apply several filters simultane-
ously in one neat editing window.
PhotoSpin
Figure 1-7: Layers enable you to easily edit elements individually in your document.

22
Working with Your First Photoshop File
Figure 1-8: The Filter menu is bursting at the seams with plug-ins 
to improve, enhance, or completely transform your image.
Liquify and Vanishing Point are more like mini-programs than filters. The 
rest of the Filter menu consists of 14 different filter categories, each contain-
ing from two to a dozen or more options:
 
✓ Single-step filters are pretty basic to use but can make a huge impact on 
an image. These include simple filters such as the Blur, Facet, and Clouds 
filters. Just select each filter to apply it; it has no options to specify.
 
✓ Dialog box–based filters let you select options galore. These filters come 
complete with preview windows, buttons, slider controls, and menus. 
You can distort, pixelate, sharpen, stylize, apply textures, and perform 
other functions with these filters.
 
✓ Photoshop CS3 introduced Smart Filters. If you convert your layer to a 
Smart Object, you can then apply a Smart Filter. A Smart Filter is smart 
because it doesn’t alter your image pixels, but merely “hovers” above them, 
thereby allowing you re-edit, or even remove, the filter if need be. For the 
scoop on this cool (and very useful) feature, see Book VII, Chapter 1.

23
Book I
Chapter 1

Environment

If you install additional filters from third parties, Photoshop lists them at 
the very bottom of the Filter menu. You can find third-party filters at Web 
sites such as www.alienskin.com, www.andromeda.com, and www.
autofx.com.
Unifying with the new Application bar
 
The new Application bar, shown in Figure 1-9, located at the far end of the 
main menu in Windows and directly below the main menu on the Mac, con-
solidates commands and features previously found, or also found, elsewhere 
in the application. For more details on most of these commands, check out 
Book I, Chapter 4. Here’s what you can find on this new bar:
 
✓ Application icon: The Photoshop icon is displayed to simply identify 
the application. In Windows, clicking the icon displays the standard 
system menu.
 
✓ Launch Bridge: This button allows you to access the image management 
application, Bridge, with a mere click.
 
✓ View Extras: Click this icon to select whether to show guides, the grid, 
or rulers from the drop-down list. For more on these items, see Book I, 
Chapter 4.
 
✓ Magnification Percentage: Displays the current magnification percent-
age. Click the down-pointing arrow to select from preset percentages of 
25%, 50%, 100%, and 200%. Or enter your desired magnification percent-
age in the text field.
 
✓ Hand and Zoom tools: Select these tools from the Application bar or 
Tools panel — your choice. Use the Hand tool to move around your 
image window and the Zoom tool to zoom in and out. For more on these 
two tools, see Book I, Chapter 4.
 
✓ Rotate View tool: Select this tool from either the Application bar or 
Tools panel. This new tool actually rotates your entire image window, 
not just the image within the boundaries of the window.
 
✓ Arrange Documents tool: Click the down-pointing arrow to select vari-
ous viewing configurations. Depending on the number of open images 
you have, various configurations will be available. You can also choose 
to float, rather than tab, your open images; create a new window; and 
display actual pixels or fit your entire image on-screen. See explanations 
of the Match commands in the section “Setting display settings with the 
Window menu,” earlier in this chapter.
 
✓ Screen Mode Switcher: Click the down-pointing arrow to select from 
standard, full screen with Menu bar, and full screen modes.

24
Working with Your First Photoshop File
 
✓ Workspace Switcher: Click the down-pointing arrow to select a different 
workspace. Note that the Essentials workspace resets all your panels 
and menus to the default settings.
 
 If you’re a Mac user and don’t care for this new bar, hide it by choosing 
Window➪Application Bar. Also, if you use other CS4 applications, you 
may find a similar Application bar.

Simplifying your edits with the Options bar
The Options bar, shown in Figure 1-10, is a great feature because it elimi-
nates the need to access a separate options panel for each tool. The bar 
remains available at all times, docked below the Menu and Application bars 
(unless you decide to hide it for some bizarre reason), and the options 
change as you switch tools. If the default location doesn’t work for you, feel 
free to move it anywhere you please.

Options bar
Figure 1-10: The ubiquitous Options bar is dynamic and reflects various options for the tool 
in use and operation being performed.
Because the Options bar changes its appearance with each active tool, I 
can’t explain all the components you might find there, but all Options bars 
do have some characteristics in common:
 
✓ Gripper bar: Grab this little bar, on the far left, with the mouse and drag 
to undock or dock the Options bar. You can let the Options bar float 
anywhere in the working space.
 
✓ Tool Presets/Options pop-up menu: This box displays the icon of the 
currently active tool. Click the down-pointing arrow to access a drop-
down list that includes a selection of brush tips (for painting and erasing 

26

tools); a flyout-type options menu that lets you select presets (saved set-
tings) for various tools; and additional options to set, such as the size of 
the icons used to represent brush tips. You may also reset a particular 
tool — or all tools — to the Photoshop default values.
 
✓ Bar options: Additional options, such as mode, opacity, feather, type 
styles, and fonts are arrayed on the rest of the Options bar.
Viewing and navigating the image
A hodgepodge of functions is sprinkled throughout the View menu. Some 
of them, such as Proof Setup, Proof Colors, and Gamut Warning, won’t 
trouble you until you’ve become a fairly advanced Photoshop user. For new 
Photoshop users, the various commands to zoom into and out of the image 
are likely the most familiar. You can also choose your screen mode, which 
lets you view your image full-screen with the Menu bar and panels, or full-
screen with just panels.
 
You’re better off accessing some functions, especially the zoom features, 
through keyboard shortcuts. See Book I, Chapter 5 for details.
From the View menu, you can select which extras 
Photoshop displays. You can choose to see (or 
hide) the following, as shown in Figure 1-11:
 
✓ Layer Edges: Displays a blue-stroked box that 
surrounds the boundaries of the content of 
the selected layer.
 
✓ Selection Edges: Moving lines that define the 
boundary of a selection and are very useful 
for obvious reasons.
 
✓ Target Path: Lines and curves that define a 
shape or are used to select part of an image. 
You definitely want to see them if the paths 
need editing.
 
✓ Grid and Guides: Lines that display on-
screen, which are great when you’re aligning 
selections, objects, or other components, and 
potentially distracting when you’re not.
 
✓ Count: Bulleted numbers indicating your counted elements will appear. 
As this book went to press, Adobe was considering putting the Count 
feature in only the Extended version of Photoshop.
 
✓ Smart Guides: Smart Guides enable you to precisely position and align 
layer content, and only appear when needed.
Figure 1-11: Viewing and 
navigating your image are the 
main tasks on the View menu.

✓ Slices: Rectangular pieces of an image to which you can optimize or 
apply Web features. If you slice the image, you probably want to view 
the results.
 
✓ Notes: On-screen notes that you can create and view. Notes can some-
times be confusing, unless you’re already confused; then notes can help 
you sort out what’s what.
 
The View menu holds the controls for turning on and off the snap feature in 
Photoshop. (The snap feature makes objects magnetically attracted to grids, 
guides, or other objects.) You can also create new guides, lock and clear 
slices (see Bonus Chapter 2 for slice-and-dice information), and turn rulers 
on or off. (The Introduction has details about finding bonus chapters on this 
book’s companion Web site.)
Introducing Adobe ConnectNow
 
With the Creative Suite 4, Adobe has introduced a new and, more importantly, 
free Web conferencing application that enables users to share ideas and col-
laborate on projects online. Using any computer platform and any browser, 
users can participate in online meetings and work sessions. ConnectNow

Chapter 2: Getting to Know 
the Tools Panel
In This Chapter
✓ Using the Tools panel
✓ Taking a look at what each tool does
✓ Creating tool presets
A
fter you have a good grasp of the overall Photoshop environment 
(described in Book I, Chapter 1), you’re ready to dive into the cache 
of gadgets that — along with the menus, panels, and dialog boxes — make 
it all happen. Just like you can use a saw, hammer, and nails to transform a 
pile of 2-x-4s into a garden gazebo, you can use the Lasso tool, Healing Brush, 
and Smudge tool to convert a mediocre photo into a masterpiece that’s fit to 
be framed. But remember, behind every garden 
gazebo is a carpenter who knew how to use the 
tools required to build it.
Turning On the Tools Panel
You can access the Tools panel by choosing 
Window➪Tools. Here are a few tips for using the 
Tools panel:
 
✓ To quickly hide and show the Tools panel 
(along with the other panels), press Tab.
 
✓ To move the Tools panel anywhere within the 
Photoshop window, drag the title bar. Re-dock 
the Tools panel by dragging it back to its 
original location.
By default, the Tools panel is a single column. Click the double triangle at 
the top of the panel to display a two-column configuration.
Selecting tools
To select a tool, simply click it in the Tools panel. A small black triangle in 
the bottom-right corner of a tool slot indicates that more tools are hidden 
behind that tool on a flyout menu, shown in Figure 2-1 (note that the Tools 

30
Turning On the Tools Panel
panel in Figure 2-1 is from the Extended Version of Photoshop). Click and 
hold down your desired tool to access the flyout menu. You can also access 
tools by using keyboard shortcuts (which are listed in the Cheat Sheet at the 
front of the book).
Figure 2-1: The Photoshop Tools panel offers a multitude of tools 
for your editing pleasure.

31
Book I
Chapter 2
Getting to Know 
the Tools Panel
Turning On the Tools Panel
For the most part, you can access a hidden tool by pressing the Shift key 
along with the keyboard letter of the visible tool. For example, to select the 
Pencil tool, which shares the flyout menu with the Brush tool, press Shift+B.
 
If you don’t like having to press the Shift key to access a hidden tool, choose 
Edit➪Preferences➪General (Photoshop➪Preferences➪General on the Mac) 
and deselect the Use Shift Key for Tool Switch option. You can then rotate 
through the tools by pressing the same letter repeatedly.
When you hover your mouse pointer over a tool, color control, or icon, you 
see a tool tip. The tool tip tells you the name of the tool or icon and its key-
board shortcut, if any. Although helpful at first, it can get annoying after a 
while. Turn it off by deselecting the Show Tool Tips option in the Interface 
section of the Preferences dialog box.
Getting to know your tools
The Tools panel is divided into three basic sections: tools, color swatches, 
and icons for Quick Mask or Standard mode. The following sections intro-
duce you to the tools. The following list details the other residents of the 
Tools panel, shown in Figure 2-2:
 
✓ Foreground Color and Background Color: Color swatches represent 
the current foreground and background colors. When using some of the 
tools and applying some commands, you may apply one of these colors. 
The small black-and-white swatches represent the default colors.
 
• Click the Default Colors icon to reset the colors to the default.
 
• Click the curved arrow icon to switch the foreground and back-
ground colors.
 
 For everything you need to know about color, see Book II, Chapter 3.
 
✓ Edit in Quick Mask Mode: The default editing mode is Standard mode. To 
edit in Quick Mask mode, click the icon. I cover Quick Masks, which offer 
a way to view, make, and edit a selection, in detail in Book VI, Chapter 2.

Introducing the Photoshop Tools
 
The Screen modes, which used to reside at the bottom of the Tools panel, 
have been moved to the new Application bar (Window➪Application Bar on 
the Mac only). This bar is located at the top of the application window, to 
the right of the Menu bar on the PC and directly below the Menu bar on the 
Mac. Click the icon located on the far-right of the Application bar to access 
various view modes. The default Standard Screen Mode enables you to see 
your entire Photoshop desktop. You can also select Full Screen Mode with 
Menu Bar, which hides your desktop background and other open images. Or 
click Full Screen Mode, which hides everything but your current image. Note 
that when you select this mode, a warning tells you that you must press F to 
return to Standard Screen mode. In addition to viewing modes, you can also 
find other handy items in the Application bar; see Book I, Chapter 1 for 
details.
Introducing the Photoshop Tools
I’m giving you just a very brief description of what each tool does. You can 
become more thoroughly initiated with the use of each of the tools while you 
go through the book. Don’t want to go page by page through the book? Okay. 
Well, you’re in luck; I also give you the exact spot where you can find more 
on each of the tools. For what it’s worth, I’ve organized the tools into logical 
groupings — although some can cross over into other groups, and some are 
so unique that they don’t fit well in any group.
Using selection tools
The selection tools are the workhorses of Photoshop. They allow you to cap-
ture and isolate pixels so that you can edit or manipulate just a portion of an 
image. Marquee tools capture rectangular or elliptical selections, or single 
rows or columns of pixels. Figure 2-3 shows an example of an elliptical selec-
tion. Whereas the lasso tools make freeform selections, the Magic Wand tool 
creates selections by picking up pixels of similar colors. The Quick Selection 
tool enables you to “paint” your desired selection. And the Move and Crop 
tools do just what their names describe — move and crop images. See Book 
III, Chapter 1 for details on all the selection tools except the Move and Crop 
tools. You can find Move-tool details in Book III, Chapter 3, and Book V, 
Chapters 1 and 5. Crop-tool details reside in Book II, Chapter 1.
Creating and modifying paths
The path tools create and modify paths, which are elements comprised of 
straight and curved segments and anchor points. You can then use these 
paths as a basis for a selection or to define a shape.

33

Getting to Know 
the Tools Panel
Introducing the Photoshop Tools
Figure 2-3: The Elliptical Marquee tool (left) lets you make an elliptical selection, 
and the Move tool (right) enables you to move a selection within your image.
 
Because of their precision, you may find that using path tools to ultimately 
create a difficult selection usually yields better results than you can achieve 
with the selection tools.
The Path Selection and Direct Selection tools select your paths and path 
components after you draw the path. Figure 2-4 shows examples of using the 
Pen tool and Direct Selection tool, respectively. (For more on the Pen tools, 
see Book III, Chapter 2.)

use the Direct Selection tool to select and manipulate those points and segments.

34
Introducing the Photoshop Tools
Using painting tools
The painting tools, in general, allow 
you to apply color or erase pixels. In 
the case of the Gradient tool, you can 
apply multiple colors simultaneously. 
And with the Art History Brush tool, 
you paint on a stylized effect rather 
than color. The Color Replacement 
tool lets you replace the color of your 
image with the foreground color. 
Figure 2-5 shows an example of a heart 
drawn with the Custom Shape tool, 
painted with the Brush tool (using the Scattered Rose brush tip) Special 
Effects brush (left), and later (right) partially erased with the Eraser tool.
 
All the painting tools rely on the Brushes panel for the size, shape, texture, 
and angle for the tip of the tool. See Book IV, Chapters 1 and 2, for details on 
most of the painting tools. You can find an explanation of the Eraser’s Erase 
to History option in Book II, Chapter 4.
Using tools for cloning and healing
The cloning and retouching tools are the powerhouse tools to break out 
when you need to do some image repairs. These tools allow you to duplicate 
portions of your image, paint with a pattern, or seamlessly fix scratches, 
wrinkles, and other blemishes. The unique History Brush tool lets you actu-
ally paint a previous version of your image back into your current image — 
perfect for undoing mistakes.
The Spot Healing Brush quickly removes small blemishes and hickeys of all 
kinds. The Red Eye tool removes the nasty red reflections in the eyes of your 
loved ones, as shown in Figure 2-6. Be sure to check out Book VIII, Chapter 
3 for info on cloning, pattern stamping, and healing. You can find History 
Brush details in Book II, Chapter 4.
Figure 2-5: The painting tools can add 
texture and color to a basic shape; the 
Eraser tool erases pixels to reveal your 
background color.

demon eyes.
Creating effects with typographical tools
The type tools pretty much do what their moniker suggests — create type of 
varying sorts. The Horizontal Type tool and Vertical Type tool create regular 
old type, plus type on a path; the Mask 
Type tools create selections in the 
shape of letters — which you can then 
fill with images, patterns, colors and 
so on. Figure 2-7 shows text created 
using both the Horizontal Type and 
Horizontal Type Mask tools. (For type 
details, see Book IV, Chapter 3.)
Using focus and toning 
tools
The focus and toning tools allow you to enhance your image by altering the 
pixels in various ways. You can lighten, darken, blur, smudge, sharpen, satu-
rate, or desaturate color in selected portions of your image.
 
These tools work best for touching up smaller areas, rather than the entire 
image. For example, in Figure 2-8, I used the Smudge tool to spike the 
groom’s hair. (Hopefully he doesn’t take it personally.) To saturate the 
orange on the right, I used the Sponge tool. See Book VIII, Chapter 2 for all 
you want to know about focus and toning tools.

(left) or a type mask (right) in Photoshop.

Sponge (right) tool.
Creating shapes
The shape tools allow you to create vector-based elements in your image. You 
can fill these elements with the foreground color or leave them as an empty path.
Although vector-based elements are the heart and soul of the shape tools, 
you can also create shapes filled with pixels of the foreground color. For 
shape details, see Book IV, Chapter 1. For more on resolution, see Book 
II, Chapter 1. Figure 2-9 shows the Custom Shape (left) and Rectangle and 
Ellipse tools (right) in action.

Viewing, navigating, sampling, and annotating tools
Photoshop has an abundance of tools to 
help you view and navigate your image 
window. These tools allow you to zoom 
in (as shown in Figure 2-10) and out, 
move your image within the window, 
and measure distances and angles. 
The Eyedropper and Color Sampler 
tools let you pick up and sample color 
respectively — handy for grabbing or 
evaluating color in an image. The Notes 
tool creates written notes that you can 
leave within an image window — useful 
for collaboration purposes or simply 
for reminders to yourself. (See Book II, 
Chapter 3 for more on the Eyedropper and Color Sampler tools. For the low-
down on the Measure, Zoom, and Hand tools, see Book I, Chapter 4.)
 
Bonus Chapter 3 covers the Notes tool. See the Introduction for details 
about this book’s companion Web site.
Using tools for the Web
Photoshop doesn’t have a whole lot of tools dedicated to the preparation 
of Web images. That’s mainly because Adobe’s other programs (Fireworks, 
Dreamweaver, and Flash) take up the slack in that department. In the Tools 
panel, you find the Slice tool and Slice Select tool, which allow you to create 
and select slices. Slices are rectangular sections from an image that you can 
optimize and turn into Web features. For example, you might slice an image — 
and, in Dreamweaver, apply rollovers and image maps in to those slices 
separately — for the best viewing experience on your Web page.
 
See Bonus Chapter 2 for all you need to know about slicing. The Introduction 
has all the details about this book’s Web site.
 
Photoshop CS4 has added a whole array of 3-D tools, which you can use to 
create graphics for Web animation, but only in the Extended version.
Saving Time with Tool Presets
 
Tool presets enable you to create tool settings that you can save and use 
again. Creating tool presets is a real timesaver if you use specific tool set-
tings on a frequent basis. For example, I make numerous 2-x-2-inch and 2-x-3-
inch rectangular selections on images I use in a newsletter. Because I saved 
the settings as presets, I don’t have to redefine them each time I want to 
select an image for my project.
Figure 2-10: The Zoom tool enables you to 
zoom in and out of your image.

Creating custom tool presets
Follow these short and simple steps to create your own custom tool preset:
 
1. Select the tool you want to create a preset for.
 
2. Select the option you want for the tool on the Options bar.
 
 For example, if you selected the Rectangular Marquee tool in Step 1, you 
may want to select Fixed Size from the Style pop-up menu and then enter 
your desired Width and Height values.
 
3. Click the Tool Preset Picker button on the Options bar, as shown in 
Figure 2-11 (it’s on the far-left side of the Options bar).
 
 Or you can choose Window➪Tool Presets to work through the Tool 
Presets panel.

4. Click the Create New Tool Preset button (the dog-eared-page icon).
 
 Or, if you’re using the Tool Presets panel, choose New Tool Preset from 
the panel menu. If the tool doesn’t allow for presets, such as the Measure 
tool, for example, the Create New Tool Preset button is grayed out.
 
5. Name the preset and click OK.
 
 Your new preset is now saved and ready for reuse.
 
6. To select the tool preset, you can do one of three things:
 
• Click the Tool Preset Picker button and select a preset from the pick-
er’s pop-up menu.
 
• Select a preset in the Tool Presets panel.
 
• Select a preset in the Preset Manager (Edit➪Preset Manager). Then, 
choose Tools from the pop-up menu and select your preset.
 
The Tool Presets panel contains a trash can icon that enables you to quickly 
delete a preset. Select the preset and drag it to the trash.

A
lthough you can create some interesting images from scratch in 
Photoshop, most of the time, you work with digital pictures that 
already exist. These pictures may be images captured by your scanner or 
photos you’ve snapped with your digital camera.
Photoshop offers you a lot of different options for 
opening existing images, creating new images, and 
saving original files or copies to your hard drive. 
After you open, edit, and save your files, you may 
want to transfer those images from screen to 
paper. This chapter takes you through the steps 
you need to know to get your photos in and out of 
Photoshop.
Browsing for Files
If you don’t know the exact filename or location 
of an image, you can use Adobe Bridge to search 
for and open files. (Check out Book I, Chapter 4 
for a complete description of Bridge.) Finding a 
file is about as easy as you might expect: Choose 
File➪Browse in Bridge or press Alt+Ctrl+O (Option+Ô+O 
on the Mac). The Bridge window opens, as shown in Figure 3-1.
 
You can also just click the Launch Bridge button, which is a Br icon on the 
new Application bar.

42
Opening an Image
Figure 3-1: Adobe Bridge allows you to efficiently search for your images.
In the default workspace, to navigate to a folder you want to search, click the 
Folders tab and locate your desired folder from the list. Click an image in the 
lightbox area to see it in the Preview window (which shows up on the right 
side of the Bridge). Photoshop graciously provides information about the file 
in the Metadata panel located below the Preview.
When you find a file you’re sure you want to open, either double-click 
it, choose File➪Open, or choose File➪Open With (and then choose your 
desired application) on the Bridge menu.
Opening an Image
If you know where an image file is 
stored, you can open the file in a simi-
lar way to opening a word processing, 
spreadsheet, or other file. Follow these 
steps to open a file:
 
1. In Photoshop, choose File➪Open.
 
 Or press Ctrl+O (Ô+O on the Mac).
 
 The standard Open dialog box 
for Windows Vista or the Mac OS 
appears. The layout of the dialog 
box differs slightly between the 
two. Figure 3-2 shows the Windows 
version and Figure 3-3 the 
Mac version.

Figure 3-3: The split-window Mac OS X Open dialog box.
 
 
When opening images, you can click the Use Adobe Dialog button to work 
with the Adobe dialog box, rather than the standard OS dialog box. The 
Adobe dialog box, shown in Figure 3-4, is like a pared-down mini-Bridge, 
offering various views and the ability to delete items and create folders. 
Project Tools (the Toolbox icon) enables you to select an item and see its 
location in Explorer (Windows), the Finder (Mac OS), or in Bridge. You 
also have access to certain metadata, such as filename, size, and creation 
dates. Version Cue aficionados also have several tools to use.
 
2. Navigate to the folder that contains your file.
 
 From the Files of Type list (Windows) or Enable list (Mac OS), you can 
select which types of files you want to display.
 
 To view all files, select All Formats (Windows) or All Readable Documents 
(Mac OS).
 
3. Click the name of the image file you want to open.
 
 To select multiple files, click the first file and then Ctrl-click (Ô-click on 
the Mac) each additional file.
 
 You may see a preview of the image in the Open dialog box’s Preview 
window.

44
Opening an Image
Figure 3-4: The Adobe dialog box acts like a mini-Bridge.
 
4. After you select the file you want, click the Open button.
 
 The file opens in Photoshop.
 
 If you choose File➪Open Recent, a submenu lists the last files you 
worked on. Click a filename to open it or simply type the number next 
to the filename. You can define the number of files that appear on this 
menu in the File Handling section of the Preferences dialog box. (For the 
lowdown on how to specify this value, jump ahead to Book I, Chapter 5.)
Opening special files
Photoshop needs to know the image format of a file (whether it’s a TIFF, PCX, 
PSD, or JPEG file, for example) before it can open the file. Photoshop uses differ-
ent methods in Windows and Mac OS to determine the format of an image file:
 
✓ In Windows, Photoshop looks at the file extension (.tif, .pcx, .psd, 
and so forth), and if it finds a standard image-format extension, it 
assumes that the file was saved using that format.
 
 Note that file extensions are hidden by default in Windows XP and Vista. 
You, like many other users, may have changed the default to display file 
extensions.
 
✓ The Mac OS X uses a similar system based on filename extensions. File 
extensions may or may not be hidden in the Mac OS. Showing or hiding 
file extensions can be accomplished via any file’s Info dialog box. Select 
the file in the Mac OS X Finder and press Ô+I to make the Info dialog box 
pop up. In this dialog box, you can show or hide the extension for that 
file and change what application is associated with that file (and all files 
with the same extension).

Placing Files
For compatibility reasons, Macintosh applications such as Photoshop usually 
use the Windows file extension. However, when you move files from one plat-
form to the other, they can easily be misidentified. With Photoshop’s Open As 
feature, you can specify the format that you think (or know) a given file uses. 
This facility works slightly differently in Windows than in the Mac OS.
Opening specific files using the Windows OS
In Windows, follow these steps to open a specific file:
 
1. Choose File➪Open As and navigate to the file you want to open.
 
2. From the Open As drop-down list, select the file format you want 
to use.
 
3. Double-click the file’s icon.
 
 If you selected the right format in Step 2, the file opens in Photoshop. If 
the file doesn’t open, you may have selected the wrong format. Select 
another and try again.
Opening specific files using the Mac OS
The standard Open dialog box includes an Enable option at the top. Select 
All Documents from the pop-up menu at the top. Then, you can select the file 
format you want to try directly from the Format list.
Opening as a Smart Object
Photoshop enables you to open a file as a Smart Object. Choose File➪Open 
as Smart Object to create a special layer that can contain both raster and 
vector data. Smart Objects are beneficial because they allow you to trans-
form and manipulate your image data non-destructively. (For details on 
Smart Objects, see Book V, Chapter 5.)
Placing Files
In Photoshop, use File➪Place to put PDF (Portable Document Format), 
Adobe Illustrator (AI), EPS (Encapsulated PostScript), PSD, JPEG, TIFF, BMP, 
GIF, PNG, and several other lesser-used formats files into separate layers of 
their own. These files are often created by programs other than Photoshop 
(such as Adobe Acrobat or Adobe Illustrator) or acquired from your digi-
tal camera. Although Photoshop can open these files independently, you 
can use the Place feature if you want to combine them with an existing 
image.

46
Placing Files
Follow these steps to place a PDF, Adobe Illustrator, or EPS file:
 
1. Open an existing document into which you want to place a file.
 
2. Choose File➪Place.
 
 The Place dialog box opens.
 
3. Navigate to the file you want to insert and then double-click the file.
 
 If you’re placing an Illustrator file, make sure it was saved with PDF 
Compatibility checked in the Illustrator Options dialog box. Otherwise, it 
may not be placed.
 
 For some types of files, such as 
multipage PDF files, you may see 
a dialog box like the one shown in 
Figure 3-5, which lets you specify 
which page you want to place. You 
can also select either the entire 
Page or just a particular Image on 
the page. Finally, select how much 
of your image you want to place 
from the Crop To pop-up menu. 
The default bounding box crops to 
the smallest area that includes text 
and graphics.
 
 Photoshop automatically places 
PDFs, JPEGs, TIFFs, or PNGs 
(among other image types) as 
Smart Objects. For more on Smart Objects, see Book V, Chapter 5.
 
 Your image appears in a bounding box in the center of your Photoshop 
image.
 
4. If you want, reposition the artwork by positioning your cursor inside 
the bounding box and dragging.
 
 You can also transform (size, rotate, and so on) your placed artwork, if 
you want — by dragging or rotating the handles on the bounding box or 
by entering values on the Options bar. Hold down the Shift key to con-
strain the proportions when scaling.
 
 You don’t have to be concerned if your placed image is a Smart Object, 
but be careful about sizing non–Smart Object images. If you enlarge them 
too much, you may degrade the quality of your image. For more informa-
tion on transforming images, see Book III, Chapter 3. Avoid degradation of 
quality by creating a Smart Object, which I explain in Book V, Chapter 5.
 
 Note that when you place a file, you can’t edit the text or vector art-
work in it within Photoshop. Why? Because Photoshop rasterizes the 
file, using the resolution of the file into which you placed it. You can, 
Figure 3-5: Use the Place command when 
importing a page from a multipaged PDF 
into an existing file.

Creating a New Image
however, edit a Smart Object in the program it was created in, such as 
Illustrator. See Book V, Chapter 5 for details. Note that when art is larger 
than the Photoshop image, Photoshop downsizes the art so that it fits 
the image. See Book II, Chapter 1 for more on rasterizing and resolution.
 
5. If you’re placing vector artwork, select Anti-Alias on the Options bar if 
you want to soften the edges of the artwork during the transformation.
 
 Not selecting the option produces a hard edge.
 
6. Double-click inside the bounding box to commit the placed image to a 
new layer.
 
 You can also press Enter (Return on the Mac) or click the Commit 
button (the check icon) on the Options bar.
Creating a New Image
At some point, you’ll want to create a new image from scratch. You may 
want an empty canvas to paint on or need a blank image as scratch space. 
Or you may want to paste a copied selection into a new document.
Follow these steps to use the New feature to create a new image:
 
1. Choose File➪New.
 
 Or press Ctrl+N (Ô+N on the Mac).
 
 The New dialog box appears, as 
shown in Figure 3-6.
 
2. Type a name for the new file.
 
 If you don’t specify a name, 
Photoshop creates one for you, 
such as Untitled-1, Untitled-2, and 
so forth.
 
3. If you want to create content 
for mobile devices (such a cell 
phone, PDA, or mini portable PC), 
click the Device Central button.
 
 What follows is a quick, easy process:
 
a. Specify your desired preferences by choosing Edit➪Preferences 
(Device Central➪Preferences on the Mac) and selecting your 
default Phone ID, language, and fonts in the Adobe Device Central 
dialog box.
 
 You may also specify your levels of Undo.
Figure 3-6: Specify all your desired options 
in the New dialog box.

Creating a New Image
 
b. In the dialog box’s main window, select your desired device pro-
file from the Device Sets list or from the Local or Online Libraries, 
as shown in Figure 3-7.
 
 Click the grouping icon (the two arrows) at the top of the Local 
Library and Online Library sections to view the device sets via 
another sorting criteria. Click the magnifying glass icon to search for 
a particular device.
 
c. Under the New Document tab, select the type of content you want 
to create, such as a full-screen graphic or wallpaper.
 
 To create a custom size, check the Custom Size option at the bottom 
and enter your desired dimensions.
 
d. Click Create.
 
 Your new document, sized and ready for art, opens in Photoshop.
 
 If you want to preview how your content will look, choose File➪Save for 
Web & Devices. See Bonus Chapter 1 for details.

 Note that you can also access the Device Central dialog box by choos-
ing File➪Device Central. And you find the same command in both Adobe 
Illustrator and Flash.
 
4. In the New dialog box, select a preset image category from the Preset 
pop-up menu.
 
 Choose from common categories such as U.S. Paper, Photo, Web, Mobile 
and Devices, and Film and Video.
 
 The Clipboard provides the size that corresponds with an image that 
you copied. Here are a couple of other preset tips:
 
• You can also choose to match the size of any open file. Open files are 
listed at the bottom of the Preset list.
 
• If you select Custom, Photoshop also allows you to create a user-
defined custom preset based on your defined settings: After you 
define your values, click the Save Preset button in the New Document 
Preset dialog box. Name your preset. Choose any or all the options 
you want to include in your preset. When you choose not to include 
an option, Photoshop displays the last used value for that option. 
Click OK. Your custom preset now appears near the top of the 
Preset list.
 
5. If you selected an image category from the Preset menu in Step 4, 
select your desired preset Size for that category.
 
6. Or, if you chose Custom in Step 4, enter the width and height of your 
image manually by typing the width and height of your choice in the 
text boxes.
 
 Note that any Preset sizes automatically revert to Custom when any 
of the preset’s values are changed, and that when you change the 
units for either the width or height, the other dimension also changes. 
You can hold down the Shift key to change both width and height 
independently.
 
 Like with other Photoshop dialog boxes, you may change from the 
default unit of measurement of pixels to another, such as inches.
 
7. Enter the resolution for the new document.
 
 Note that when you select a Preset image category and size, the recom-
mended resolution is entered for you. You can change this resolution if 
desired but remember, selecting the right resolution at this point in the 
creation process is important because if you need to change the resolu-
tion later, you degrade image quality. (For more information on selecting 
an appropriate resolution, see Book II, Chapter 1.)

50
Saving a File
 
 Note that Photoshop gives you the size of your image file, based on your 
settings, in the lower-right of the dialog box. This information is good to 
know if you’re targeting a specific file size for your image.
 
8. From the Color Mode drop-down list, select a color mode.
 
 Your choices include Bitmap, Grayscale, RGB Color, CMYK Color, and 
Lab Color.
 
9. Select your desired color depth for your document.
 
 Only one-bit color depth is available for bitmap images (each pixel is 
either black or white). The 8-bit and 16-bit color depths are available 
for the other color modes. And you may also create a new 32-bit image 
in RGB or Grayscale modes. For details on modes and color depths, see 
Book II, Chapter 2.
 
10. In the Background Contents drop-down list, select an option for how 
you want the background layer to be filled.
 
 Your choices are white, the current background color, or transparent.
 
11. Click the Advanced button to display a couple of additional options:
 
• Color Profile: Assigns a color profile (a definition of the way color 
looks in a document) to your new document. The default, Adobe RGB 
(1998), is fine when creating a new document unless you have good 
reason not to. This setting provides a nice, large gamut (range) of 
RGB colors.
 
• Pixel Aspect Ratio: Selects an aspect ratio (the relationship of width 
to height). The default setting of Square is fine for print or Web 
images. Images for digital video content may require a non-square 
aspect ratio, such as D1/DV NTSC.
 
12. Click OK when you finish entering your options.
 
 Photoshop creates the new image.
Saving a File
Before you exit Photoshop, you want to save your file on your hard drive or 
other media. Don’t worry if you forget to do this; Photoshop won’t let you 
exit without first asking you if you want to save any files that you’ve changed 
or newly created.
 
Saving files from time to time while you work on them is a good idea so you 
always have a recent copy safely stored on your drive.

Saving a File
Follow these steps to save a file:
 
1. Choose File➪Save to store the cur-
rent file with its present name.
 
 Choose File➪Save As to store a 
file already saved with a different 
name, or even a file with the same 
name but in a different location.
 
 The dialog box appears, as shown 
in Figure 3-8.
 
2. Navigate to the folder where you 
want to store the file.
 
3. Type a name in the File Name 
(Save As on the Mac) text box.
 
4. Select a format from the Format 
drop-down list.
 
 Some file formats have special 
capabilities and requirements. For 
details on file formats, see Book II, 
Chapter 2.
 
5. In the Save and Color options areas, select or deselect (if available) 
the following check boxes, as desired:
 
• As a Copy: Save the file as a copy.
 
• Annotations: Include or delete annotations in the saved copy. (See 
Bonus Chapter 3 for more on annotations. The Introduction has 
details about this book’s bonus material on the Web.)
 
• Alpha Channels: Include or ignore alpha channels (stored selec-
tions). (See Book VI, Chapter 1 for a discussion of channels.)
 
• Spot Colors: Enable spot colors in the saved file. (For more informa-
tion on spot colors, see Book IX, Chapter 1.)
 
• Layers: Include layers or simply flatten the image to one layer. (See 
Book V, Chapter 1 for the lowdown on layers.)
 
• Use Proof Setup: Enable proof setup, which includes an on-screen 
preview of how the image will look when printed or viewed on a spe-
cific device. (See Book II, Chapter 3 for more information.)
 
• ICC Profile (Windows)/Embed Color Profile (Mac): Embed a color 
profile in the file based on the settings established in your Color 
Settings dialog box. Leave this value at the default setting, but check 
out Book II, Chapter 3 for information on the specialized situations 
when you might want to change it.
Figure 3-8: Saving a file frequently is 
one of the smartest things you can do in 
Photoshop.

52
Closing and Quitting
 
• Thumbnail (Windows only): Embed a thumbnail image in the file if 
you’ve defined thumbnails as optional in Photoshop’s Preferences. 
(You can find more on preferences in Book I, Chapter 5.)
 
• Use Lower Case Extension (Windows only): Use lowercase exten-
sions (that is, .tif rather than .TIF), regardless of how you type 
the filename.
 
6. Depending on which file format you select, you may get an additional 
dialog box of options.
 
 For specifics on these file format options, see Book II, Chapter 2.
 
7. Click Save to store the image.
Closing and Quitting
When your session is finished, you want to close up shop and quit 
Photoshop. PC users, in addition to using the traditional File➪Exit option, 
can close Photoshop in any of the following ways:
 
✓ Choose Close from the Windows Control menu in the upper-left corner 
of the Photoshop title bar.
 
✓ Click the Close (X) button in the upper-right corner of the Photoshop 
title bar below Windows.
 
✓ Press Ctrl+Q.
Mac users can choose Photoshop➪Quit Photoshop or press Ô+Q.
When you use any of these methods, Photoshop asks you whether you want 
to save any open file that hasn’t been saved (or hasn’t been saved since it was 
modified in this session). Click the Yes button to save and close the files.
 
You can also close any open files without exiting Photoshop by pressing 
Ctrl+Alt+W (Ô+Option+W on the Mac).
You want to have a backup copy of an image safe on your hard drive prior 
to an editing session. If you change your mind about the modifications 
you make to an image, you can always return to the backup copy. Choose 
File➪Save As and enter a new name for the file. You can also select the As a 
Copy check box and append the word “copy” to the current filename.
Getting It on Paper
Hard-copy prints have become a hugely popular output option, thanks largely 
to the swarm of inexpensive photo-quality inkjet printers that are vying for your 
discretionary dollars. Today, anyone can afford a printer capable of producing 

53
Book I
Chapter 3
Starting, Finishing, 
and Getting It 
on Paper
Getting It on Paper
sparkling prints from digital images. The chief problem is restraining the urge to 
print everything in sight before your ink tank (and wallet) runs dry.
Actually, making the prints is only a minor puzzle, and one addressed in the 
following sections. You can print most images with just a few clicks. Most of 
the advanced options I discuss in this chapter are needed only for special 
situations or specialized applications, and they’re not discussed in detail; 
the following sections cover only the basics. If you need more detailed infor-
mation on printing, see Book IX, Chapter 1.
 
Many photofinishers, service bureaus, or even retail outlets can make prints 
from your Photoshop-edited images if you burn them to a CD, save them to 
a USB Jump Drive, or upload them to an FTP site over the Internet. Vendors 
such as Shutterfly (www.shutterfly.com), Kodak (www.kodakgallery.
com), and MyPublisher (www.mypublisher.com) offer prints of all sizes, 
calendars, and professionally printed and bound photo books.
Taking a look at printers
You can print Photoshop images on any kind of printer — but aside from 
the occasional 200-copy print run of black-and-white “Have You Seen This 
Kitty?” posters, monochrome laser printers are not high on the list of 
favored Photoshop output hardware.
More often, you’re choosing a full-color printer — probably an inkjet model, but 
possibly other models (such as dye-sublimation, thermal-wax, solid-ink, or even 
color laser) — as your printer. Although all these printers produce roughly simi-
lar results, they do have some differences, as detailed in the following list:
 
✓ Inkjet printers: These printers paint the page by spraying a jet of ink 
one dot at a time, under precision computer control. They produce 
better results when used with photo paper designed especially for ink-
jets. Inkjet printers generally provide excellent full-color output, but the 
cost of consumables (ink and paper) can add up fast.
 
✓ Dye-sublimation printers: These printers potentially offer better-looking 
prints, but the printers and materials are more expensive than inkjet 
printers. They use a continuous ribbon of color panels in a roll that’s 
the same width as the print, with each panel used only once. The print 
head’s tiny heating elements can melt dots of dye over a range of 256 
values to generate up to 16.8 million colors.
 
✓ Thermal-wax printers and solid-ink printers: These printers use blocks 
of wax or resin that are melted and sprayed directly onto a page. These 
devices are commonly used in printing barcodes and labels for clothing, 
autos, and aircraft.
 
✓ Color Laser: Color laser printers use colored toner and apply ink in four 
passes. They tend to be a little more expensive, and the quality isn’t as good 
as a nice inkjet print. They do usually print much faster than inkjet printers.

Getting It on Paper
Printing an image
The process of printing an image in Photoshop is slightly different in the 
Windows and Mac operating systems. The chief differences are in the Page 
Setup step, in which you select a printer and specify orientation, paper size, 
and other parameters. The following sections take a closer look at the Page 
Setup dialog box in the two operating systems.
Page setup in Microsoft Windows
With Windows applications such as 
Photoshop, you open the Page Setup 
dialog box by choosing File➪Page 
Setup or by pressing Shift+Ctrl+P. In 
this dialog box (shown in Figure 3-9), 
you can select the paper size, orienta-
tion (portrait or landscape), and other 
things — such as which paper tray 
to use
Page setup in the Mac OS
Choose File➪Page Setup or press 
Shift+Ô+P. You can set the page size 
and orientation, scaling, and addi-
tional parameters, depending on your 
printer, as shown in Figure 3-10.
In Mac OS X, you can also select a 
printer directly from the Print dialog 
box, just like you can in Windows. 
Also in Mac OS X, if you’re connected 
directly to a printer via the USB port, 
the system automatically detects the 
printer. If you’re on a network, select a 
printer from the Printer list in the Print 
dialog box.
Setting printing options
 
Photoshop has a couple printing 
modes to choose from, depending on 
how much control you need and how 
much of a hurry you’re in. Here are 
your options:
 
✓ Print One Copy: A quick way to 
print a hard copy using the default 
settings.
Figure 3-9: Set your desired paper size 
and orientation in the Windows Page 
Setup dialog box.
Figure 3-10: The Mac Page Setup 
dialog box offers options for paper size, 
orientation, and scaling.

✓ Print (Ctrl+P on a PC, Ô+P on the Mac): Opens a generous Print dialog 
box that includes a Preview window and many options. This dialog box 
is almost identical in Windows and Mac operating systems. Figure 3-11 
shows the Mac version.
Corbis Digital Stock
Figure 3-11: The Print dialog box gives you a multitude of options.
To set your print options, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪Print.
 
 The Print dialog box opens.
 
2. Select your desired printer from the Printer drop-down list.
 
3. Specify the number of copies you want.
 
4. Click the Page Setup button if you need to revisit that dialog box.
 
 Note that in Windows Vista, this dialog box may look different than 
the one you see when choosing File➪Page Setup, depending on which 
printer you selected in the Print dialog box. You may see specific set-
tings customized for your printer, such as print quality, special effects, 
and so on. These settings vary from printer to printer, so be sure to con-
sult your printer’s instruction manual.
 
5. Change your page orientation in the Print dialog box by clicking the 
Portrait or Landscape button next to the Page Setup Button.
 
6. Use the Top and Left boxes in the Position area to indicate where you 
want the image to appear on the page.

56
Getting It on Paper
 
 To center the image, select the Center Image check box. You can also 
click and drag the image in the preview window to position it if the 
Bounding Box option is selected.
 
7. If you aren’t centering your image, select your desired unit of measure-
ment from the Units drop-down list at the bottom of the dialog box.
 
8. If you want to scale the image up or down, select the scale percentage 
and/or enter height and width values in the Scaled Print Size area.
 
 You can also scale the image by clicking and dragging the corner 
handles of the image in the preview window. However, make sure the 
Bounding Box option is selected. Scaling in the Print dialog box doesn’t 
change the physical dimensions of the image, just the print size. But 
keep in mind that scaling up may give you a less-than-optimum printout. 
Additional options include
 
• Scale to Fit Media: Sizes your image to fit on a particular paper size.
 
• Match Print Colors: Gives you a soft proof in your Preview. For more 
on soft proofs, see Book II, Chapter 3.
 
• Gamut Warning: This new option displays colors that will be out of 
gamut, or out of the range of printable colors. These colors appear as 
gray pixels by default.
 
• Show Paper White: This option simulates the white point of the 
paper you choose in the Printer Profile submenu. (Choose Color 
Management from the menu at the top-right to access the Printer 
Profile submenu.)
 
 The Match Print Colors, Gamut Warning, and Show Paper White 
options are available only when your Color Handling is set to 
Photoshop Manages Colors. For details on color management when 
printing, see Book IX, Chapter 1.
 
• Bounding Box: Places the handles around the image area and allows 
for visual sizing.
 
• Print Selected Area: Allows you to print only part of a large image. 
Note that you need to make the selection before choosing the Print 
command.
 
• Units: Select your desired unit of measurement.
 
 Note that your document’s resolution is now displayed, as well.
 
9. Choose Output from the drop-down list located in the top-right.
 
 The other option on the drop-down list, Color Management, controls 
advanced proofing and color-profile tasks. (Check out Book IX, Chapter 
1 for information on printing using color management and Book II, 
Chapter 3 for more detail on general color-management topics.)

10. Select the Output printing options you want to apply:
 
• Background: The area surrounding the printed image is called the 
background, not to be confused with the background color on the 
Colors panel or the background layer of an image. You can change 
this color from the default (white) to any other color.
 
• Border: The dialog box that pops up lets you add a black border 
around an image in any width from 0 to 10 points, 0 to 3.5 millime-
ters, or 0 to .15 inches.
 
• Bleed: A bleed is an image that extends right up to the edge of the 
paper size on one or more edges. In effect, you’re cropping inside the 
image area. In practice, most printers don’t actually print right to the 
edge, so to bleed, say, a 5-x-7-inch image, you need to print it on a 
larger sheet of paper, such as 6 x 8. Clicking the Bleed button opens 
a dialog box in which you enter a width in inches, millimeters, or 
points inside the edge of the image.
 
• Screen: When you click the Screen button, you see the Halftone Screens 
dialog box that lets you create halftones for color separation. See Book 
IX, Chapter 1 for more information on color separations.
 
• Transfer: This is an advanced function used for prepress operations 
to compensate for the change in dot sizes when halftone images are 
printed on a press. Leave this setting at the default unless your ser-
vice bureau or offset print representative tells you otherwise.
 
• Interpolation: This option is available with only some printers, 
particularly PostScript Level 2 (or higher models), to even out the 
jagged appearance of diagonal lines. Just be aware that interpolation 
can help only so much, and in some cases, it can be damaging. For 
more on interpolation, see Book II, Chapter 1.
 
• Include Vector Data: If you have vector artwork in your image, be 
sure to include this option. For more info on printing vector data, see 
Book IX, Chapter 1.
 
• Send 16-Bit Data (Mac only): This options sends 16-bit information 
to the printer. Check it only if your image is 16-bit.
 
11. Select options for marking the area outside the print area.
 
 These options include several items that appear only when the print 
area is smaller than the paper size:
 
• Calibration Bars: This option adds an 11-step grayscale bar outside 
the image area when printing to a paper size that’s larger than the 
image area. You can use calibration bars to gauge how accurately the 
gray tones of an image are being reproduced.
 
• Registration Marks: Registration marks are handy when you’re print-
ing with multiple plates for color separations, such as those used in 
four-color or duotone processes. These marks help keep the plates 
aligned so the image is printed properly.

58
Getting It on Paper
 
• Corner Crop Marks: Clicking 
this box prints crop marks 
at the corners of the image, 
which indicate where trimming 
should take place. You can 
see these and other marks in 
Figure 3-12.
 
• Center Crop Marks: These 
crop marks show where the 
page will be trimmed at the top, 
bottom, and each side.
 
• Description: To include a 
description on a printout, 
choose File➪File Info and enter 
the text you want to appear. 
Then, check the Description 
box in the Print dialog box.
 
• Labels: Selecting this check 
box prints the document name 
and channel name on the 
image. (See Book VI, Chapter 1 for more on channels.)
 
12. Set the options that apply when you’re printing to film for color sepa-
rations, if that’s the case.
 
 Be sure to talk to your service bureau or offset printer representative for 
their recommendations. (For more tips, see Book IX, Chapter 1.)
 
 Here are your choices:
 
• Emulsion Down: The side of a film or photographic print paper 
that’s light-sensitive is called the emulsion side. You must specify 
whether you want the emulsion side up or side down for film output. 
Emulsion Down is the most common film output choice, although 
some publications may request Emulsion Up. The default is Emulsion 
Up (the check box isn’t selected). This option isn’t available with all 
printers.
 
• Negative: When you print an image on paper, you usually want a pos-
itive image, in which case, you shouldn’t select the Negative check 
box. If you’re printing the image on film (as is the case if you’re print-
ing color separations), your printer will probably request a negative.

Chapter 4: Viewing and 
Navigating Images
In This Chapter
✓ Exploring the image window
✓ Zooming within an image
✓ Moving with the Hand tool
✓ Traveling around with the Navigator
✓ Selecting screen modes
✓ Positioning and measuring precisely
✓ Finding images with Adobe Bridge
✓ Sharing images in a PDF or Web gallery
P
 hotoshop offers a variety of ways to view 
your image documents while you work with 
them. You can pull back to look at the big picture 
or zoom in to work on a tiny portion of the image 
in minute detail. A useful Navigator panel is also 
at hand to show you exactly where you are in an 
image and help you move to a specific spot with 
a click of the mouse button. Should you want to 
align objects precisely on the screen, Photoshop 
offers grids and guides with some “magnetic” 
properties. And, if you’re having trouble finding 
the image you want, an uber-browser, called Adobe 
Bridge, helps you search visually.
This chapter introduces you to all these viewing 
and navigating aids, each designed to help you spend 
less time cruising around the images and more time working with them.
Looking at the Image Window
Each Photoshop image document resides in its own window. A great feature 
of this window is that you can open multiple image windows for the same 
image. This feature comes in handy because sometimes you want to look at 

60
Looking at the Image Window

an image from two perspectives. For example, you may want to get up close 
and personal with an image to edit pixels, but you still want to view the full 
image in a fairly large size, as shown in Figure 4-1. In either case, all you need 
to do is create a new image window for the same image. You can size each 
window separately, and you can center the window on any portion of the 
image you want.
Corbis Digital Stock
Figure 4-1: Creating a new image window enables you to view the overall image while editing an 
area in close-up view.
Here’s a quick list of what you can do with multiple windows:
 
✓ Keep different parts of an image straight by creating multiple 
windows. Select the document window you want and then choose 
Window➪Arrange➪New Window for (filename) from the Menu bar. 
You can size and position the new window, and zoom in or out, without 
affecting the view of the original window.
 
✓ Keep windows organized by cascading them. If you find that you’ve 
created so many windows that you can’t view them all easily, Photoshop 
can automatically arrange them for you in its working space. Choose 
Window➪Arrange➪Cascade to create an overlapping stack of win-
dows arranged from the upper-left to the lower-right side of your dis-
play. Be sure, however, that your images are all floating in windows 
(Window➪Arrange➪Float All in Windows).

✓ Keep from losing important windows by tiling them. Choose 
Window➪Arrange➪Tile to arrange the windows side by side without 
overlapping. Photoshop shrinks the document windows so they all fit 
on-screen but doesn’t change the zoom amount. 
 
 You can also now click the Arrange Documents icon (next to the last 
icon) in the Application bar. Select from among a variety of layouts for 
your image windows. For example, you can choose to Tile All Vertically. 
 
✓ Tidy up by closing windows you don’t need anymore. To close a spe-
cific window when your images are tabbed, click its Close button in the 
upper-right corner of its title bar. If your images are in floating windows, 
click in the top-left corner.
 
✓ Close all windows in one fell swoop. To close all windows, choose 
File➪Close All. 
 
✓ Minimize/maximize a document. Note that your images must be in 
floating windows to view the Minimize and Maximize icons.
 
✓ Bring all Photoshop documents to the front (in Mac OS). The Mac OS 
allows you to work in multiple applications and multiple files simultane-
ously. Choose Window➪Arrange➪Bring All to Front to bring all your 
Photoshop documents to the forefront.
Zooming In and Out of Image Windows
Photoshop offers several ways to zoom in or out of an image, but you’ll 
probably find yourself using one method, such as the keyboard shortcuts, 
almost instinctively. Each method has advantages of its own. The following 
One image, two monitors
For many image-editing enthusiasts and pro-
fessionals, one monitor simply isn’t enough. If 
you have Windows XP or Vista installed, or any 
recent Mac OS, you can set up your computer 
so that you can use two monitors to edit an 
image. The extra space offers advantages for 
viewing and navigating your images.
In Windows, you can drag the image window 
anywhere in the Photoshop working space. If 
you want to drag it to a second display screen 
(and your video card supports spanning two 
displays), you have to stretch the Photoshop 
working space (or application window) across 
both displays. This works great if both moni-
tors are the same size. But if the monitors are 
significantly different sizes, it doesn’t work so 
well. Either way, make sure your monitors are 
set to the same resolution. Remember that you 
can also move panels and dialog boxes onto a 
second monitor.
Although explaining how to set up multiple moni-
tors on various operating systems is beyond the 
scope of this book, you can likely find details 
on how to set up an additional monitor in your 
operating system’s Help feature.

sections offer a quick discussion of the main zoom features, as well as some 
of the lesser-known zooming tricks.
Zooming with keyboard shortcuts
 
The keyboard shortcuts are the quickest and easiest way to zoom, after you 
use them enough to remember what they are. Table 4-1 offers a rundown 
of the handiest zoom keyboard shortcuts, which work no matter what tool 
you’re using. When you press a keyboard shortcut, Photoshop zooms in or 
out by one of its preset increments (such as 200 percent, 100 percent, 50 
percent, 33 percent, 25 percent, and so forth). The maximum magnification 
Photoshop now allows is 3,200 percent; the minimum magnification is less 
than one percent, way more than you’d ever need.

Using the Zoom tool
Click the Zoom tool in the Tools panel or press Z to activate it. You can also 
select the Zoom tool in the Application bar. Click anywhere in the image to mag-
nify it by one of the preset magnifications mentioned in the preceding section. 
Hold down the Alt key (or the Option key on the Mac) and click with the Zoom 
tool to zoom out. In either case, the zoom centers on the point you click.
 
The Zoom tool’s big advantage is its zoom selection facility. With the Zoom 
tool, drag in your image to create a temporary selection. When you release 
the button, Photoshop zooms in to fill the image window at the highest mag-
nification that includes the selected area.
When the Zoom tool is active, you also have additional zoom tools on the 
Options bar, as shown in Figure 4-2. Selecting a plus (+) or minus (–) sets the 
default magnification of the Zoom tool to either enlarge or reduce the image.

Figure 4-2: Zoom options include handy buttons for fitting your image on-screen and displaying 
the image’s print size.
When you zoom in and out, Photoshop doesn’t alter the size of the document 
window, so your image may become too large for its window (in which case, 
scroll bars appear so you can view the rest of the image) or too small (in 
which case, a gray border appears around the image).
 
Select the Resize Windows to Fit option on the Options bar to make 
Photoshop automatically change the size of the document window to show 
the full document in view, up to the size of the Photoshop working area.
Select the Zoom All Windows option to have Photoshop size all open docu-
ments simultaneously. For the other options on the Options bar, see the fol-
lowing section.
 
Version CS4 now offers animated zooms. This feature enables you to zoom 
in smoothly when you hold down your mouse button with the Zoom tool 
active. Be sure to check the Animated Zoom option in the Preferences set-
tings. For details on setting this, and other, zoom preferences, see Book I, 
Chapter 5.
Other ways to zoom
Although you’ll likely use the zoom methods mentioned in the preceding 
section most often, Photoshop offers some other ways to zoom that come in 
handy from time to time as well:

64
Zooming In and Out of Image Windows
64
 
✓ Zooming from the View menu: Choose View➪Zoom In or View➪Zoom 
Out to enlarge or reduce the image from the Menu bar. You can also 
choose from these options on the View menu:
 
• Actual Pixels: Shows your image on-screen at a 1:1 pixel ratio
 
• Fit on Screen: Enlarges the image to the maximum size that fits 
within the application window
 
• Print Size: Shows the image at the size it will print
 
 To resize windows to fit on-screen when you’re not using 
the Zoom tool, choose Edit➪Preferences➪General (or 
Photoshop➪Preferences➪General on the Mac) and select the Zoom 
Resizes Windows option.
 
✓ Typing ratios in the Magnification box: The Magnification box at the 
bottom of each document shows the current magnification ratio. Type 
an exact magnification ratio in this box and press Enter (Return on the 
Mac) to produce a custom zoom level. This box is handy if you need a 
specific amount of enlargement or reduction.
 
 Another Magnification box appears in the Navigator panel, along with 
some other options for zooming. I describe them in the section “Cruising 
with the Navigator Panel,” later in this chapter.
 
✓ Zooming with the Application bar: Select a preset zoom level from or 
enter any desired percentage in the Zoom Level drop-down list on the 
Application bar.
 
✓ The following commands live on the Window➪Arrange menu:
 
• Match Zoom: Choose Match Zoom to have all your open documents 
match the magnification percentage of your active document.
 
• Match Location: Choose this command to match the locations of all 
your open documents with the location of your active document. For 
example, if you’re viewing the center portion of an image, choosing 
this command then adjusts the views of all your open documents to 
the center, as well.
 
• Match Rotation: This new command enables you to match the 
canvas rotation of your active document, created by using the new 
Rotate View tool.
 
• Match All: And finally, Match All does all three commands 
simultaneously.
 
 ✓ Magnifying by dragging: With the Zoom tool, drag over the portion of 
the image you want to zoom into. A selection marquee appears, and 
when you release the mouse button, that portion of the image fills your 
document window. To freeze and then move the selection marquee 
around the image, begin your drag and then hold down the spacebar 
while dragging the marquee to a new location.

 Note that when you now zoom in greater than 500%, a pixel grid 
appears. Instead of having pixels butt up against one another flush, like 
in previous versions of Photoshop, a thin, gray line separates each pixel.
Handling the Hand tool
 
 The Hand tool helps you to quickly move around in an image document and 
works similarly to a scroll bar.
The Hand tool is more of a function than an actual tool because you rarely 
need to click the Hand tool to use it. Simply hold down the spacebar while 
using any other tool, and the cursor changes into the Hand icon, enabling 
you to move the image around in its window by dragging.
Here are some tips for using this tool:
 
✓ Press H to activate the tool. To activate the Hand tool without clicking 
its icon in the Tools panel, just press the H key. You can also select this 
tool from the Application bar.
 
✓ Use the Options bar to change the size of a window. When the Hand 
tool is active, the Actual Pixels, Fit on Screen, Fill Screen, and Print Size 
buttons appear on the Options bar. Click these buttons to display your 
image in a 1:1 pixel ratio (100% magnification); make the entire image fit 
within your screen; make the image fill your application working space; 
or make the document appear in the size it’ll be when printed.
 
✓ Use the Hand tool while zooming. When the Hand tool is active, you 
can hold down the Alt key (Option key on the Mac) and click the image 
to zoom out, or hold down the Ctrl key (Ô key on the Mac) and click to 
zoom in — without needing to press the spacebar like you would with 
the normal keyboard shortcut.
 
✓ Scroll All Windows. When the Hand tool is active, this option, in the 
Options bar, enables you to move around all open documents 
simultaneously.
 
✓ Double-click the Hand tool. Resizes the document image to a Fit on 
Screen magnification
 
✓ Press the Page Up or Page Down buttons to change the view. These 
buttons move the view up or down by a window.
 
 Now that you’ve become friendly with the Zoom and Hand tools, here’s 
one last tip. If you hold down the Shift key while scrolling with the 
Hand tool or zooming with the Zoom tool, all open image windows 
scroll or zoom together. This trick can come in especially handy, 
for example, when you create another view of the same document 
(Window➪Arrange➪New Window).

66
Cruising with the Navigator Panel

Rotating with the new Rotate View tool
 
Sharing the flyout menu with the Hand tool is the new Rotate View tool. This 
new tool, which can also be found in the Application bar, actually rotates 
your entire image window, as shown in Figure 4-3.
Follow these steps to use the Rotate 
View Tool:
 
1. Select the Rotate View tool from 
the Tools panel or Application 
bar.
 
2. Place your tool cursor in your 
image window and hold down the 
mouse button.
 
 A compass rose appears.
 
3. Drag the cursor clockwise (or 
counterclockwise) to rotate your 
image window.
 
 Note that you can see your 
numeric rotation angle in the 
Options bar. Check the Rotate All 
Windows option to simultaneously 
rotate all open documents.
 
4. When you reach your desired 
rotation angle, release your mouse button.
 
5. If you want to undo your rotation, click the Reset View button in the 
Options bar.
 
 Note that choosing Edit➪Undo or using the History panel to undo 
doesn’t revert your image to the original 0-degree rotation.
Cruising with the Navigator Panel
Some Photoshop users don’t use the Navigator panel (which is a roadmap 
to your image document) nearly as often as they could, and there’s a simple 
reason for that: In its default size, the Navigator panel is just too darned 
small to be of use.
Most new Photoshop users see the tiny Navigator window and decide that 
working with such a small thumbnail image isn’t worth the bother. There’s 
a quick fix, and after you’ve seen exactly what the Navigator panel can do for 
you, it may become one of your favorite tools. Here are the keys to using the 
Navigator panel, which you open by choosing Window➪Navigator:
Figure 4-3: Rotate your entire image 
window.

Chapter 4
Viewing and

Cruising with the Navigator Panel

✓ Resize the Navigator panel. 
Before you begin working with 
the Navigator panel, shown in 
Figure 4-4, grab the size box at the 
lower-right corner of the Navigator 
panel and drag it down and to the 
right to create a jumbo version 
with a much larger, more viewable 
thumbnail. It’s easiest to resize 
when you pull the panel out of the 
dock and let it float in the applica-
tion window.
 
 Resizing works really well if you’re 
using a second monitor. Placing 
the jumbo-sized Navigator panel 
on the second monitor works 
great. For more on working with
 two monitors, see the sidebar 
“One image, two monitors,” in 
this chapter.
 
 The Navigator panel is one panel 
that you probably want readily accessible. It’s most useful when it’s vis-
ible at all times. Undock the Navigator panel by pulling the tab of the 
panel to the left. Position the Navigator panel to one side of your image 
so it’s ready for instant use.
 
✓ View the thumbnail. The entire Navigator window shows the full docu-
ment image, with an outline called a View box showing the amount of 
image visible in the document window at the current zoom level.
 
✓ Change the view. Click anywhere in the thumbnail outside the View box 
to center the box at that position. The comparable view in your main 
document window changes to match.
 
✓ Move the view. Click anywhere in the thumbnail inside the View box 
and then drag to move the box to a new position. The main document 
window changes to match the new view.
 
✓ Zoom in or out. Click the Zoom In button (which has an icon of two 
large pyramids) or Zoom Out button (which has an icon of two smaller 
pyramids) to zoom in or out. Or drag the Zoom slider that resides 
between the two icons. The View box changes size when you zoom in or 
out, and Photoshop magnifies or reduces the view in the original docu-
ment window to match, as well.
 
✓ Specify an exact magnification. The lower-left corner of the Navigator 
panel has a Magnification box. It shows the current magnification, and you 
can type a new value to zoom to the exact magnification level you need.

If the View box color is too similar to a dominant color in your image, you 
can select a new color for its outline by selecting Panel Options from the 
Navigator panel pop-up menu.
Choosing a Screen Mode
Photoshop’s working area can become horribly cluttered. And here’s 
a secret: The more adept you become, the more cluttered the desktop 
becomes. Just when you begin to appreciate a neatly docked Options bar 
and the convenience of displaying panels, you realize that you’ve gobbled up 
all your free working space.
Photoshop now has three different screen modes (or maybe five, depend-
ing on what you consider to be a screen mode). Each mode shows or hides 
some of the elements on the screen at the press of a key or click of the 
mouse button. Select a mode by clicking the Screen mode icon at the right 
end of the Application bar. The final two modes are accessible via keyboard 
commands. Table 4-2 shows you how to unclutter your screen quickly.

Getting Precise Layout Results
Photoshop includes numerous useful features that help you lay out your 
images precisely. There are dozens of reasons to make a selection in a par-
ticular place, position an object at an exact location, or align several objects 
along the same imaginary line. Here are a few examples:

✓ You want to draw parallel lines exactly 50 pixels apart to create a 
“window blind” effect.
 
✓ You’re creating a set of thumbnails that need to be aligned in neat rows 
and columns.
 
✓ You want to create an object that’s the exact same size (in one or more 
dimensions) as another object already in your image.
You have several tools to help you do this and more.
Creating guides
Guides are nonprintable horizontal and vertical lines that you can position 
anywhere you like within a document window. Normally, they’re displayed 
as solid blue lines, but you can change guides to another color and/or to 
dashed lines.
To use guides, choose Edit➪Preferences➪Guides, Grid & Slices (or 
Photoshop➪Preferences➪Guides, Grid & Slices on the Mac), as I discuss 
in Book I, Chapter 5. Guides would be useful, even if they were only, well, 
guides. However, they have another cool feature: Objects and tools dragged 
to within 8 screen pixels of a guide are magnetically attracted to the guide and 
snap to it. That makes it ridiculously easy to align objects precisely. Because 
the objects snap to the guides, you can be confident that you’ve placed the 
objects exactly on the guide and not just near it. You can turn off the Snap to 
Guides feature if you want a little more control in your arrangements.
To place guides, follow these steps:
 
1. Make sure that rulers are visible in your image.
 
 Choose View➪Rulers to display them, if necessary.
 
2. Click in the horizontal ruler and drag down to create a new horizontal 
guide. Release the mouse button when the guide is in the location you 
want.
 
 Anytime you create a guide by dragging from the ruler, the Show Guides 
option automatically switches on. At other times, you can show or hide 
guides by choosing View➪Show➪Guides or by pressing Ctrl+semicolon 
(Ô+semicolon on the Mac).
 
3. Click in the vertical ruler and drag to the right to create a new vertical 
guide.
 
 When you release the mouse button, your new guide stops.
 
 You can also create a horizontal guide by Alt-clicking in the vertical ruler 
(Option-clicking on the Mac), or create a vertical guide by Alt-clicking in 
the horizontal ruler (Option-clicking on the Mac). Use whichever method 
is faster for you.

4. Use the Move tool (press V to activate it) to reposition your guides.
 
 Look for the guides in Figure 4-6.
Using guides
After the guides are in place, here are a few of the things you can do with them:
 
✓ Turn the Snap to Guides feature on or off. Choose View➪Snap To➪
Guides.
 
✓ Lock all guides so you don’t accidentally move them. Choose 
View➪Lock Guides. You can also press Alt+Ctrl+semicolon 
(Option+Ô+semicolon on the Mac).
 
✓ Remove all guides and start from scratch. Choose View➪Clear Guides.
 
✓ Change a horizontal guide to a vertical guide (or vice versa). Hold 
down the Alt key (Option key on the Mac) while you drag the guide with 
the Move tool.
 
✓ Align a guide at a precise location on the ruler. Hold down the Shift 
key while you drag a guide to force it to snap to the ruler ticks.

✓ Create a new guide in a precise location. Choose View➪New Guide, 
click the Horizontal or Vertical option, and type a distance from the 
ruler where you want the new guide to reside.
 
✓ Hide and show guides. Click the View Extras icon in the Application bar and 
select Show Guides from the drop-down list to toggle the view off and on.
Using grids
The Photoshop grid feature offers a convenient canned set of guidelines 
already nicely arranged for you at preset intervals. You can use a grid for 
any application where you want to align objects in a pleasing, geometrically 
precise arrangement.
Grids share some features in common with guides but boast a few 
differences, too:
 
✓ Like guides, grids don’t print with 
your image. They’re used only as 
reference lines in your on-screen 
image, as shown in Figure 4-7.
 
✓ Objects and tools can option-
ally snap to the lines on a grid, 
depending on whether you have 
View➪Snap To➪Grid turned on 
or off.
 
✓ You can show or hide grids by 
choosing View➪Show➪Grid. Or 
click the View Extras icon in the 
Application bar and select Show 
Grids from the drop-down list to 
toggle the view off and on.
 
✓ You can change the color of the grid and select solid lines, dashed lines, 
or dots for the grid by choosing Edit➪Preferences➪Guides, Grid, Slices 
(Photoshop➪Preferences on the Mac).
 
✓ You can specify the distance between grid lines and the number of 
subdivisions between grid lines in the Preferences dialog box. For more 
information on setting grid and guide preferences, see Book I, Chapter 5.
Measuring On-Screen
You can measure distances and objects within Photoshop many different 
ways. The rulers, used in combination with guides, are a good way to mark 
distances precisely so that you can create objects of a particular size. You 
can change the increments used for these measurements in Photoshop’s 
Preferences, as I detail in Book I, Chapter 5.

Figure 4-7: Grids enable you to arrange 
elements along evenly spaced lines.

However, Photoshop also has a handy Ruler tool that you can use to lay 
measurement outlines in any direction. These lines tell you a great deal 
more than just the size of the object you’re measuring. You can also mea-
sure angles and determine the exact coordinates of an object.
When you use the Ruler tool, the Options bar offers a read-out of informa-
tion that includes the following values:
 
✓ X, Y — the X and Y coordinates of the start of the line: For example, 
if you start at the 1-inch position on the horizontal ruler and the 3-inch 
position on the vertical ruler, the X and Y values on the Options bar 
are 1.0 and 3.0, respectively. (You select the increments for the X and Y 
values on the ruler in Photoshop’s Preferences.)
 
✓ W, H — the horizontal (W) and vertical (H) distances traveled from 
the X and Y points: A 1-inch long, perfectly horizontal line drawn from 
the X,1 and Y,3 position shows a W value of 1.0 and an H value of 0.0.
 
✓ A: The angle of the first line or the angle between two lines.
 
✓ L1: The total length of the line.
 
✓ L2: The total length of the second line.
 
✓ Clear: Press the Clear button to delete your current measurement.
Measuring an object
To measure an object, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the Ruler tool.
 
 It’s tucked away in the Tools panel with 
the Eyedropper. Press I, or Shift+I to cycle 
between the Eyedropper, Color Sampler, Note, 
and Ruler tools until the Ruler tool appears.
 
2. Click at a starting location for the measuring 
line and then drag to the end location.
 
 Hold down the Shift key while dragging to con-
strain the line to multiples of 45 degrees.
 
3. Release the mouse button to create the mea-
surement line, as shown in Figure 4-8.
Measuring an angle
You can measure an angle by drawing two lines 
and reading the angle between them from the 
Options bar. Just follow these steps:
 
1. Select the Ruler tool in the Tools panel.
Figure 4-8: The Ruler tool is 
your on-screen measuring 
device.

2. Click at a starting location for the first line and drag to the end location.
 
 You can hold down the Shift key while you drag to constrain the line to 
multiples of 45 degrees.
 
3. Release the mouse button to create the first line.
 
4. Hold down the Alt key (the Option key on the Mac) and click the end-
point of the first line that you want to use to measure the angle.
 
5. Drag the second line and release the mouse button when you reach 
your desired length.
 
6. On the Options bar, read the angle between the two lines (labeled A).
 
 You can also see the length of each line, labeled L1 and L2, as shown in 
Figure 4-9.

Using the Info Panel
The Info panel, accessible under the Window menu, shown in Figure 4-10, 
displays a variety of information, depending on what tool you’re using. To 
specify which status info options you want displayed, or whether you want 
Tool Hints shown, select Panel Options from the Info panel pop-up menu. 
For example, if you’re using the Ruler tool, the information in the Info panel 
duplicates the measurements shown on the Options bar. Selecting other 
tools modifies the Info panel’s appearance to reflect the functions of that 
tool. Here’s some of the information you can find out by keeping the Info 
panel visible on your desktop:
 
✓ When using most tools, the Info panel displays the X and Y coordinates 
of the cursor, as well as the color values of the pixel directly beneath the 
cursor.
 
✓ When making a selection with the marquee tools, the Info panel shows 
both the X and Y coordinates of the cursor, as well as the width (W) and 
height (H) of the selection.
 
✓ When dragging with the Crop or Zoom tools, the Info panel shows the 
width and height of the marquee used to define the cropping or zoom 
borders. The Crop tool’s current angle of rotation (A) is also displayed.
 
✓ With the Line, Pen, and Gradient tools, the Info panel shows the X and Y 
coordinates of the starting position for the line, path, or gradient you’re 
defining, as well as the distance (L) of the line you’ve dragged, the 
change in X and Y directions (Delta X and Delta Y), and the angle (A).
 
✓ When you use a transformation command, the Info panel displays the 
percentage change in the Width, Height, Angle, Angle of Horizontal Skew 
(H), and Angle of Vertical Skew (V). For more on transformations, see 
Book III, Chapter 3.
 
✓ When you use a color adjustment, such as 
Levels, and that adjustment dialog box or 
adjustment layer is active, the Info panel dis-
plays before and after color values beneath 
the mouse cursor. See Book VIII, Chapter 1 
for more on color adjustments.
 
✓ After you make a selection with the Lasso or 
Magic Wand tools, the Info panel shows the 
Width and Height of the selection.
 
✓ Select Panel Options from the Info panel’s 
pop-up menu. In the Info Panel Options 
dialog box that appears, you can define a 
second color readout, in addition to the 
default readout, using a different color 
model if you want, as shown in Figure 4-11. 
In addition to the regular color modes, the

default Actual Color option dis-
plays values in the current mode of 
the document. Proof Color displays 
values based on the setting chosen 
in View➪Proof Setup. The Total 
Ink option displays the percentage 
CMYK ink under the cursor based 
on the settings in the CMYK Setup 
dialog box in the Color Settings 
(Advanced). You can also define 
a measurement increment for the 
mouse cursor (in inches, pixels, 
millimeters, and so forth) inde-
pendently of the increment you’ve 
selected in Preferences. You can 
also choose to display other types 
of information about your file. For 
more info on these options, see 
Book I, Chapter 1.
Working with Extras
Extras are the optional items displayed on your screen, such as grids, pixel 
grids, guides and smart guides, selection and layer edges, notes, slices, and 
the target path (a line drawn with the Pen tool). Although you can turn on 
and off the display of each option independently, the Extras function helps 
you to create a set of extras that you want to see or hide. You can then turn 
them all on or off at the same time.
The following list explains how to show or hide these extras:
 
✓ To turn one extra on or off, choose View➪Show and then select the 
extra you want to show.
 
✓ You can also hide and show your guides, grid, and ruler by clicking the 
View Extras icon in the Application bar.
 
✓ To show or hide extras in a group, 
choose View➪Show➪Show Extras 
Options. Select each extra that you 
want to show in the dialog 
box that appears, as shown in 
Figure 4-12.
 
✓ To show or hide all the extras 
you’ve selected in the Extras 
Options dialog box, choose 
View➪Extras or press Ctrl+H 
(Ô+H on the Mac).

Managing Images with Adobe Bridge
Adobe Bridge, shown in Figure 4-13, is command and control central for not 
just Photoshop, but the entire Adobe Creative Suite. Version CS4 enhances 
Bridge even more. So, if you haven’t embraced Bridge yet, it won’t be long 
before you appreciate the omnipresent power of this application.

Figure 4-13: Adobe Bridge enables you to visually explore and locate your digital media assets.
Adobe Bridge enables you to visually browse your network, hard drives, 
and external media to find the exact image you need, and it has a multitude 
of viewing, sorting, cataloging, and organizing features to manage all your 
assets — photographic, illustrative, video, written, and so on. The Bridge is 
so multifaceted that, although you can access it from any Adobe application, 
it’s also a stand-alone program.
Here’s a brief description of what the Bridge offers:

✓ File Browsing: View, search, organize, and process your files. You can 
open, move, delete, rotate, label, and rate your images.
 
✓ Version Cue: If you have the Creative Suite installed, you can use the 
Bridge to organize and manage your Version Cue projects.
 
✓ Bridge Home: Again, if you have the Creative Suite, you have access 
to the Bridge Home, where you can get up-to-date information (such as 
tips, tricks, and news) about your Creative Suite applications. Click the 
house icon at the top of the Favorites panel to access the Bridge Home.
 
✓ Camera Raw: You can open and edit Camera Raw files directly from the 
Bridge and save them in a format that’s compatible with Photoshop. 
Note that you can edit JPEG and TIFF files, as well.
 
✓ Color Management: You can use the Bridge to synchronize the color 
settings across all your Creative Suite applications to ensure color 
accuracy and consistency. Note that this capability requires you have 
the applications installed on your computer.
 
✓ Create Projects: Finally, you can create projects, such as slideshows, 
PDF presentations, and Web galleries.
You can access the Bridge in several ways:
 
✓ In Photoshop, choose File➪Browse in Bridge.
 
✓ Click the Bridge icon in the Application bar.
 
✓ To launch Bridge directly, choose Start➪Adobe Bridge in Windows Vista 
(double-click the Bridge icon in the Dock or in the Applications/
Adobe/Bridge folder on the Mac).
Brief anatomy of Bridge
Before I dive headlong into the applicable operations of the Bridge, let me 
give you a brief anatomical breakdown of each of its main components (refer 
to Figure 4-13):
 
✓ Menu bar: Commands found on the Menu bar allow you to open or 
delete images, get photos from your camera, create stacks, add file info, 
and search for images. You can also label files and append their meta-
data (information about your file). The Menu bar also offers options 
for sorting and viewing files. Finally, on the Tools➪Photoshop menu, 
you have access to basically the same Automate menu that you find in 
Photoshop itself, plus a couple unique commands, which I cover in the 
section “Using the Menu bar and buttons,” later in this chapter.
 
✓ Application bar: You find some often-used commands on the new 
Application bar (which now comes standard in most of the Creative Suite 
applications) at the top of the application window. Click the right- and left-
arrow buttons to go forward and back among your files and folders. Click

the down-pointing arrow button to go to a parent or favorites location. 
Click the arrow-and-clock icon to access a recent file or folder. Click the 
camera icon to get photos from a camera. The Refine icon offers several 
options:
 
• Review Mode: This mode leaves the Bridge interface and displays 
your images full screen. You can find more details about this mode in 
the section “View Menu,” later in this chapter.
 
• Batch Rename: In this dialog box, you can rename, move, or copy a 
folder of images in one fell swoop. Bridge runs a script and processes 
the images simultaneously.
 
• File Info: This command brings up a comprehensive metadata panel 
in which you can edit info about your file. For more details, see 
Bonus Chapter 3 on the Web.
 
✓ Folder Hierarchy: A bar that appears below the Menu and Application 
bars lists the current location (such as a folder on your hard drive) on 
display. Click the right-pointing arrow to view the particular folder’s 
hierarchy, as well as Favorites and Recent Folders.
 
✓ Shortcut buttons: Create a new folder, and rotate or delete files with 
a click of the button. You can also switch to Compact mode (which I 
explain how to do in the following section).
 
✓ Favorites panel: Located in the upper-left of the Bridge window, this 
panel provides easy access to folders, files, as well as Version Cue and, 
if you’re a Creative Suite user, the Bridge Home. Drag whatever hard 
drives, folders, or files you want to include in your Favorites panel.
 
✓ Folders panel: Also located in the upper-left of the Bridge window, this 
panel shows the folder hierarchy on your computer. If an image file is 
available to your computer, Bridge lets you use this panel to find it.
 
✓ Filter panel: Enables you to see your assets sorted by various criteria. 
For example, you can view your images by date created, keywords, file 
type, and even the ISO setting of your camera. Select your criteria in the 
Filter panel, as shown in Figure 4-14, and view the results in the Content 
window. Click the No icon (a circle with diagonal line) at the bottom 
of the Filter panel to clear all filters. Click the pushpin icon to keep the 
filter intact when browsing for files in Bridge.
 
✓ Collections panel: If you’ve already gone through the trouble of meticu-
lously naming your files, or you’re like me and are too darned lazy to do 
so, then the new Collections panel is for you. It’s a lot less time-
consuming than using keywords — simply select, or find, your desired 
images in the Content area (technically referred to as the light table) 
and click the New Collection icon at the bottom of the panel. If you 
want to include selected files into a new collection, click Yes when 
prompted. Name your collection. To add a file to an existing collection, 
simply select the image(s) and drag it (or them) into the folder icon in 
the Collections panel. To delete a collection, select the collection and 

80
Managing Images with Adobe Bridge
80
click the trash icon. Click the 
time-saving New Smart Collection 
icon to have Bridge go out and 
collect your files based on estab-
lished criteria. Choose where to 
look and by what criteria. To add 
another criterion, click the plus 
sign. Specify match settings — any 
or all — and specify whether you 
want to include subfolders and 
non-indexed files. Click Save. If all 
goes well, you have a collection, or 
digital photo album, in short order.
 
✓ Workspace controls: Select from a 
variety of presets — Essentials (the 
default workspace), Filmstrip, or 
Metadata located at the top of the 
Bridge window. You can find addi-
tional workspaces in the pop-up 
menu to the right of the Metadata 
button. You can also find com-
mands to create a new workspace, 
and delete and reset workspaces. 
Find details on creating a new work-
space in the following section.
 
✓ Preview panel: In the top-right of 
the Bridge window is a preview of 
the currently selected file. You can 
reduce or enlarge the preview by 
dragging the separator bars on the left and bottom of the Preview panel. 
To more closely examine a portion of your image in the Preview panel, 
simply click the image. That portion then appears in a loupe window 
over your image. Hold down and drag the loupe to view other portions 
of the image. To close the loupe, simply click in the loupe window.
 
✓ Content light table: The largest area of the Bridge window is reserved for 
displaying the content. This window shows thumbnail images of all the 
files in the currently selected folder, along with information about each 
file. In addition, any subfolders are shown with a folder icon.
 
✓ Keywords panel: This feature lets you tag your images with keywords, 
such as the names of people or places, to enable easier locating and 
sorting of images.
 
✓ Metadata panel: The Metadata panel shows information about your 
images. The File Properties section shows items such as filename, date 
of creation, date last modified, image format, size, and so on. Any file 
information for images added via File➪File Info appears in the IPTC 
section of the Metadata panel. Likewise, you can also enter or edit 
Figure 4-14: The Filter panel sorts and 
displays your assets.

81

file information directly in the IPTC section in the Bridge. Finally, the 
Camera Data section displays information associated with your digital 
photos, such as the make and model of your camera, exposure, and ISO 
speed. You can also display other types of metadata, such as Camera 
Raw information, by selecting them in the Preferences dialog box, 
accessed via the Metadata panel pop-up menu.
 
 In Bonus Chapter 3 on this book’s companion Web site, you can find out 
about the Notes feature and advanced features of the Metadata panel. 
See the Introduction for details about this book’s Web site.
 
✓ Viewing controls: At the bottom of the Bridge window is a slider that 
reduces or enlarges the content thumbnails. Note that you can enlarge 
thumbnails up to 640 pixels. There are also icons to view your content 
as thumbnails, details, or a list.
Configuring the Bridge window
The Bridge, being as enormous and full-featured as it is, is surprisingly flexi-
ble when it comes to how you configure its various panels. Here’s a rundown 
of how to customize your Bridge window:
 
✓ To size the entire Bridge window, diagonally drag any corner or edge of 
the window. (On the Mac, drag the lower-right corner.)
 
✓ To resize panels, drag the bar that divides them. Position your cursor 
over the bar (the cursor changes to a double-headed arrow), and then 
click and drag the bar to size the panel.
 
✓ Switch to Compact mode by clicking the icon in the far-right corner of 
the Application window. This command condenses your Bridge window 
to just a portion of your light table and the Application bar. Click the 
Ultra Compact Mode icon to reduce the window to just the Application 
bar. Click the Switch to Full Mode icon to revert back. Other viewing 
options are available in the drop-down menu in the top-right corner 
when you’re in one of the compact modes.
 
✓ You can drag and regroup the tabbed panels in the Bridge, just like you 
can with Photoshop panels. To collapse a panel, double-click its tab.
 
✓ After you configure your Bridge, you can save it as a workspace preset 
that you can then call up at anytime. For example, you may want one 
workspace for working with photos and yet another when working with 
layout or word-processing files. Simply choose Window➪Workspace➪
New Workspace. Provide a name, choose to save your window location and 
sort order of images as part of the workspace, and click Save. Note that you 
can also select New Workspace from the Workspace drop-down menu in 
the Application bar. To access the workspace, choose Window➪Workspace 
and then select the name of your saved preset. It also appears as its own 
icon in the Workspace area at the top of the Bridge window. You may also 
select from several preset workspaces designed for specific tasks. For 

82
Managing Images with Adobe Bridge
82
example, if viewing files is your most important task, then select the Light 
Table preset, shown in Figure 4-15. Not happy with a workspace? Choose 
Window➪Workspace➪Delete Workspace and select your workspace from 
the Workspace drop-down list in the Delete Workspace dialog box. Or 
simply reset your workspace back to the Essentials workspace, the default.
Figure 4-15: The Light Table workspace focuses on the best viewing configuration in the Bridge.
Using the Menu bar and buttons
The Menu bar is a visual testimony to the numerous capabilities of the 
Bridge. The following sections provide a brief rundown of what you find 
on each menu.
File menu
Here’s what you find on the Bridge’s File menu:
 
✓ New Window: If you want one window to remain displayed as-is, choose 
this command to create another Bridge window.
 
✓ New Folder: This command creates a new folder in the location listed in 
the folder hierarchy. You can also click the Create a New Folder button 
in the row of shortcut buttons.
 
✓ Open: After you select a thumbnail in the Content window, you can choose 
the Open command to open the image in Photoshop or another CS4 appli-
cation. Of course, you can also simply double-click the selected file(s). To 
open multiple files, just hold down Ctrl (Ô on the Mac) while selecting.

✓ Open With: Select a file and choose the Open With command. Select 
your program of choice from the submenu that appears.
 
✓ Test in Device Central: Select a file and then this command, which 
launches the Adobe Device Central mini-application. In this mini-
application, you can see how your image will look on a variety of mobile 
devices. See Book I, Chapter 3 for details on Device Central.
 
✓ Open Recent: Choose from your most recent ten files.
 
✓ Open in Camera Raw: Select a Camera Raw file and choose this com-
mand to edit the Raw settings. You can also open JPEG or TIFF files.
 
✓ Close Window: When you have enough of the Bridge, choose this 
command.
 
✓ Delete (Move to Trash on the Mac): If you want to eliminate a file, select 
it and choose this command. Kiss that file goodbye by emptying the 
trash. You can also click the trash icon in the top-right of the Bridge 
window. Remember that when you trash things via the Bridge, you’re 
actually deleting them from the desktop, as well.
 
✓ Eject (Mac only): Select your media and then this command to eject that 
media from your computer.
 
✓ Return to (program): Choose this command to leave the Bridge and 
return to your program of choice.
 
✓ Reveal in Explorer (Finder on the Mac): This command brings up your 
operating system’s window and reveals the location of the selected file.
 
✓ Reveal in Bridge: This command visually escorts you to where your 
selected file resides.
 
✓ Get Photos from Camera: Select your desired device (camera or card 
reader) and import your images into your chosen folder and subfolder. 
Click Get Photos to start the download. Click Advanced Dialog if you 
want to apply metadata to the imported images.
 
✓ Move to: Select a file and move it to another location on your computer 
or network.
 
✓ Copy to: Select a file and copy it to another location on your computer 
or network.
 
✓ Place: Select a file, choose Place, and then choose one of the CS4 
applications, such as InDesign, from the submenu. That program then 
imports your selected file.
 
✓ Add to Favorites: You can choose to add or remove a folder from your 
Favorites. If you’re not familiar with Favorites, it’s a special folder that 
lists your favorite files, folders, programs, and drives for quick and 
handy access. You can easily find the Favorites panel and the Folders 
panel in the top-left of the Bridge window. And, depending on your 
operating system, you’ll come across numerous ways to access your 
Favorites.

84

✓ File Info: This feature lets you add some of your own metadata, such 
as title, author, copyrights, dates, credits, and so on. This information 
can come in handy for photographers and reporters. You can also edit 
(replace, append, save, and delete) some other data, such as IPTC data. 
But feel free to leave this data as it is.
 
Many commands, such as Open, Copy, Delete, and Label, are available via a 
context menu. Simply select an image or folder, and right-click (Control-click 
on the Mac) to access the menu.
Edit menu
On the Bridge’s Edit menu, here are your options:
 
✓ Preferences: Mac users can find the Preferences window on the Bridge 
menu, rather than Edit. Briefly, General preferences control the way the 
Bridge looks and feels. For example, you can control how light or dark to 
make the Content window for your files. Metadata preferences control 
which type of data is displayed in the Metadata panel. Check out Bonus 
Chapter 3 to find out more about metadata. You can assign names and 
keyboard shortcuts to your colored Labels. Specify which application 
to use to open files of certain types. The File Type Associations are 
specific to the Bridge only. Thumbnails settings have to do with items 
such as showing additional lines of data along with the thumbnail image. 
I suggest leaving those settings at their default unless you’re certain you 
want to change them.
 
✓ Undo/Cut/Copy/Paste/Duplicate: I lumped these commands together 
because they’re all self-explanatory. Undo undoes your last executed 
command. Select a file(s) and cut, copy, duplicate, or paste it from or 
into your folder.
 
✓ Select All/Deselect All: These two commands quickly select or deselect 
all the files in your selected folder.
 
✓ Invert Selection: Selects everything that’s currently not selected.
 
✓ Find: This command enables you to find files in selected folders, includ-
ing subfolders, based on a variety of criteria such as filename, dates, 
labels, or keywords. Click Find, and the files matching your criteria 
appear in the Bridge Content window.
 
✓ Develop Settings: If you have Camera Raw images, you can open them 
directly in the Bridge and apply the default Camera Raw settings or set-
tings from a previous conversion. You can also copy, paste, and clear 
settings via this submenu.
 
✓ Rotate: The rotate commands rotate your images in varying degrees and 
directions. When you open the image, Photoshop applies the rotation. 
You can also click the rotate buttons.

✓ Creative Suite Color Settings: See whether the color settings of all your 
Creative Suite applications are synchronized (the Creative Suite applica-
tions must be installed on your computer). If they aren’t, and you want 
them to be, select your desired setting from the list and click Apply.
 
✓ Camera Raw Preferences: Choose this command to establish your 
Camera Raw image, cache, and DNG (Digital Negative) File Handling set-
tings. Mac users can find the Camera Raw Preferences window on the 
Bridge menu, rather than Edit. For more on Camera Raw, see Book II, 
Chapter 2. For more on Camera Raw Preferences, see Book I, Chapter 5.
View menu
Here’s what the View menu has to offer:
 
✓ Full Screen Preview Space: Select this option to fill your screen with 
your selected image only. Press Esc to return to the Bridge application 
window.
 
✓ Slideshow: This neat option leaves the Bridge interface and displays just 
the images, full screen, from your selected folder.
 
✓ Slideshow Options: Choose settings for your slideshow, including the 
duration of your slide display, type and duration of your transitions, and 
whether to display a caption, among others. 
 
✓ Review Mode: This mode leaves the Bridge interface and displays your 
image(s) full screen. Click the forward- and back-arrow buttons to cycle 
through the images. Click the down-pointing arrow button to eliminate 
an image from the Review mode display. Click the magnifying glass icon 
to open a window in which you can enlarge portions of your image for a 
more detailed view. Click the Next icon to create a new collection from 
the images displayed in Review mode and then return to the Bridge 
interface. Click the X icon to just return to the Bridge interface.
 
✓ Compact Mode: Select this option to get a pared-down Bridge with just a 
Content window and Application bar — no panels.
 
✓ As Thumbnails/Details/List: Display your content in the default view of 
thumbnails. View it with Details, where you get a large thumbnail along 
with metadata, ratings, and labels, as shown in Figure 4-16. Or view it as 
a list, with smaller thumbnails, filenames, and some metadata.
 
✓ Show Thumbnail Only: This option shows just the thumbnail of the 
image without the accompanying data, such as filename, date, and so on.
 
✓ Grid Lock: This option provides a grid of horizontal and vertical lines 
around your thumbnails in the Content light table.
 
✓ Show Reject Files: Display files that you’ve labeled with the harsh moni-
ker of Reject.
 
✓ Show Hidden Files: Select this option to see files that Photoshop 
doesn’t recognize.

86
Managing Images with Adobe Bridge
86
 
✓ Show Folders: This option enables 
you to view folder icon thumbnails, 
in addition to image thumbnails.
 
✓ Show Items from Subfolders: 
Select this option to have all the 
files within your subfolders 
displayed.
 
✓ Sort: From this menu, select the 
criteria by which you want to 
sort your files. The default is by 
the name of your file, but a ton of 
other options, such as label, rating, 
or date, are up for grabs. After you 
select the criteria, the Bridge dis-
plays your files accordingly.
 
✓ Refresh: If you’ve renamed a file, 
the order of your files isn’t updated in the Bridge’s window. Choose 
Refresh to get your files in order.
Stacks menu
You can select a group of images and create a stack, which makes the 
images easier to manage and cuts down on clutter in your Content window. 
The top image thumbnail in the stack is visible in the Content window, and 
the number of images in the stack is visible on the top-left corner of that 
thumbnail, as shown in Figure 4-17. It’s not mandatory, but normally, you 
want to create stacks from similar images, such as multiple exposures of the 
same subject, multiple poses of a portrait, and so on. Here are the options 
found in the Stacks menu:
 
✓ Group as Stack: Select your desired photos and choose this command 
to create a stack.
 
✓ Ungroup from Stack: Select a photo and choose this command to 
remove it from the stack. 
 
✓ Open/Close Stack: Select Open to display each image in the stack 
(surrounded by an outline). Choose Close to collapse the stack.
 
✓ Promote to Top of Stack: First, open the stack and select your desired 
image. Choose this command to have that image appear on top of the 
stack.
 
✓ Expand/Collapse All Stacks: Opens and displays, or closes, all images in 
all stacks.
 
✓ Auto Stack Panorama/HDR: This script looks at the metadata (EXIF) 
of your images, and if it finds two or more files that have a timestamp 
within 18 seconds of each other, it first inspects the images by using the 
Auto Align algorithm. If everything is good to go, it creates a group, or 
Figure 4-16: View your content as Details.

stack, of panorama shots. It also creates a stack for HDR (High Dynamic 
Range) shots if it also finds different exposure value (EV) settings in the 
metadata. You can then process these stacks in Photoshop by choosing 
Tools➪Process Collections in Photoshop.
Label menu
The Label menu offers commands for rating and labeling your files:
 
✓ Rating: Rank your files using the one- to five-star system. You can now 
also apply a Reject rating, for those images that aren’t up to par. Use the 
View➪Sort menu or the Rating shortcut button to choose your desired 
ranking. Files with that ranking then appear in the Content window.
 
✓ Labels: Label your files for quick identification and organization. Again, 
use the View➪Sort menu, or the Sort shortcut or Rating shortcut 
buttons to choose and view the labeled files.
Note that you can also assign labels and ratings to folders.

Tools menu
Here are the offerings on the Tools menu:

88

✓ Batch Rename: Choose this command to rename multiple image files 
within a folder in one execution. You can rename the files and keep 
them in the same folder or move them to a new folder. Click the Browse 
button to select that folder. Then, designate how your files are named 
by selecting an option from the pop-up menu or typing your own name. 
Choose the starting number for renamed images and specify whether 
you want to enable the naming convention to be compatible with 
another platform.
 
✓ Device Central: This command launches Adobe’s Device Central, a mini-
application that lets you create graphics for mobile devices, such as cell 
phones. See Book I, Chapter 3 for more details.
 
✓ Create Metadata Template and Edit Metadata Template: Choose which 
metadata you want to include in the template. Name the template and 
save it. Choose Edit Metadata Template if you need to later modify the 
template.
 
✓ Append Metadata and Replace Metadata: Allow you to add or sub-
stitute existing metadata based on a template. To create a template, 
choose Tools➪Create Metadata Template.
 
✓ Cache: Cache is memory that stores frequently used data, such as 
thumbnails and file info, to allow for quicker loading when you display 
a previously viewed image or folder. Building a cache for a subfolder 
enables you to store the information for a selected folder. If you purge 
the cache, you delete ranking and thumbnail information, thereby cre-
ating more disk space. Exporting a cache lets you export to the folder 
selected in the Folders panel. Cache allows you to burn a CD without 
generating thumbnails. Note that purging the cache can also fix prob-
lems with thumbnails and previews that aren’t displaying properly.
 
✓ Photoshop: Some of the features are the same as those on the 
Photoshop File➪Automate menu. See Book IX, Chapter 2 for more on 
Photomerge and Merge to HDR. For more info on batch processing, see 
Book II, Chapter 5. The Load Files into Photoshop Layers command 
takes your selected images in Bridge and creates a new layered file in 
Photoshop, using those selected images. The Process Collections in 
Photoshop command searches for stacked Panorama and HDR images 
(see the “Stacks menu” section, earlier in this chapter), and imports 
them into Photoshop for processing into composite images.
Window menu
If you’ve configured the Bridge just to your liking and want to save it as a 
workspace for future retrieval, choose Workspace➪New Workspace. You 
can also select from preset workspaces that are configured for specific 
tasks, such as optimum viewing of thumbnails or pinpointing metadata. 
Finally, under the Workspace submenu, you find commands to reset and 
delete your various Bridge workspaces. See details on workspaces in the 
section “Managing Images with Adobe Bridge,” earlier in this chapter.

89

You can also choose to display or hide your various panels in the Window 
menu. Finally, you can open a new synchronized Bridge window, enabling 
you to perform your Bridge activities within two windows.
 
You should be aware that Photoshop has bestowed the Content window 
with light table powers. You can drag images around to reorder, group, or 
rank them. What the heck? You can just drag them around to give them a 
little exercise, if you want. Sitting in the Bridge window all day can make a 
file a little stiff.
Using keywords
Keywords are descriptive labels that you attach to files. They help to catego-
rize your images, enabling you to more efficiently and quickly locate your 
desired files. Here’s the lowdown on creating and using keywords:
 
✓ To create a new keyword (a categorical folder which contains key-
words): Click the plus sign (+) icon at the bottom of the Keywords panel, 
as shown in Figure 4-18, or select New Keyword from the Keywords panel 
pop-up menu. Specify your keyword and press Enter (Return on the Mac).
 
✓ To create a new sub keyword: Select your desired keyword, click the 
arrow-and-plus-sign (+) icon at the bottom of the Keywords panel, or 
select New Sub Keyword from the Keywords panel pop-up menu. Type 
the keyword you want to add and press Enter (Return on the Mac).
 
✓ To rename an existing keyword or sub keyword: Select the keyword 
and then select Rename from the Keywords panel pop-up menu. Provide 
a new name and press Enter (Return on the Mac).
 
 Note that renaming a keyword in the panel doesn’t also rename it if 
you’ve applied it to a file.
 
✓ To delete a keyword or sub keyword from the panel: Select the key-
word; then click the trash icon or select Delete from the Keywords panel 
pop-up menu. Again, deleting the keyword doesn’t delete it from any 
files that you’ve previously applied it to.
 
✓ To apply a keyword or sub keyword: Select the file or files, and then 
check the box to the left of the keyword in the panel.
 
✓ To remove a keyword or sub keyword from a file: Select the file(s) and 
deselect the check box to the left of the keyword in the panel.
 
✓ To search for images labeled with certain keywords: Select Find from 
the Keywords panel pop-up menu. Choose your desired folder or disk 
from the Look In menu or choose Browse to navigate to your desired 
location. Select your criteria from the pop-up menus and select your 
matching specifications — any or all. To add additional criteria fields, 
click the plus sign (+). Specify whether to include all subfolders and non-
indexed files. When you finish, click the Find button. All images 
containing your entered keyword appear in the Content window of the 

90

90
Bridge. Select your desired images and then click the New Collection 
button in the Collections panel to store and arrange your images in a 
digital photo album, referred to as a collection.
 
✓ To search for keywords: Use the Quick Find field (the magnifying glass 
icon) by entering a keyword and selecting Contains, Equals, or Starts 
With from the pop-up menu.
Figure 4-18: Create keywords to organize, and later sort, your images.
Creating PDF Presentations
 
In Version CS4, Adobe eliminated both the PDF Presentation and Contact 
Sheet II commands. To replace these commands, Adobe created a kind of 
super hybrid of the two features and placed it exclusively in Bridge. You 
can use this PDF generation feature to create a single, multipaged document 
from multiple images. This feature is great for several reasons. First, your 
recipient doesn’t need to have any specific hardware, software, utilities, 
or fonts to open and view the presentation. Your recipient needs only the 
Acrobat Reader program, a free download from www.adobe.com. In addi-
tion, sending a single file that contains multiple images is a great way to 
share your photos with family and friends. You avoid the hassle of having to 
e-mail your images as separate attachments. Finally, the PDF format offers 
excellent compression, thereby squeezing your file size down significantly 
without sacrificing image quality. Just be sure to check your final file size so 
that you don’t choke your recipients’ e-mail inboxes!

High if you want to be able to print the PDF with optimum results. Select 
Low if your PDF is meant to be viewed only on-screen. Finally, if you 
want to secure your PDF via a password or disable printing, select those 
options. Both options can be good when sending a PDF for approval pur-
poses only.
 
5. In the Layout section, specify how you want your images to be 
arranged on the page.
 
 Because I want one image per page, I’m leaving it as 1 Column and 1 
Row. Specify your margin measurements and other options for spacing 
and rotation.
 
6. If you want the filename and/or file extension below each image, 
select your desired font, size and color.
 
7. If you want your file to be viewed as a slideshow, specify your view-
ing options in the Playback area:
 
• Open in Full Screen Mode: Opens the PDF in Full Screen mode, 
where the page fills the screen.
 
• Advance Every [5] Seconds: Establishes how long each image 
appears on-screen. You can change the default of 5 seconds.
 
• Loop After Last Page: Enables the presentation to continually run. If 
not selected, the presentation stops after the last image.
 
• Transition: From the pop-up menu, select how you want one image 
to transition to the next. For certain transitions, you can also specify 
the Direction and Speed of the transition.
 
8. Finally, if you want watermarked text (which will be overlaid on the 
images), such as a copyright notice, enter the text and specify the font 
attributes and colors.
 
 You can also specify the Opacity (transparency) percentage.
 
9. Check View PDF After Save to have your PDF file open in Acrobat or 
Acrobat Reader.
 
10. Click Save. Name your file and click Save again.
 
 Bridge then creates your PDF, as shown in Figure 4-20.
Creating a Web Gallery
 
Like the Contact Sheet II and PDF Presentation commands, the Web Gallery 
command got the boot out of Photoshop, as well. But don’t fret. It didn’t 
go far. It moved into a new home in Adobe Bridge  —which is good news 
because, by now, you’re probably so proud of your Photoshop artistry that 
you want to show it off to the world on a Web page. It’s a breeze to use, so

even if you don’t know anything about 
HTML — except that it’s an acronym 
you hear a lot — you can create a 
Web-based display page for your images 
with very little trouble.
All you need to do is select the images 
you want to include on your Web page, 
select a style, enter a little information, 
and sit back and watch while Bridge 
does the rest. Of course, tell all your 
friends and colleagues where to find it.
If you want to know more about creat-
ing Web pages and posting them for 
anyone and everyone who has Internet 
access to see, check out Web Sites 
Do-It-Yourself For Dummies, by Janine 
Warner (Wiley).
A Web gallery is a Web page that 
includes small thumbnails and links that 
enable visitors to view those images in a larger size. But using thumbnails 
isn’t your only option. The gallery can also showcase one image at a time in 
large form and change the view at intervals, just like a slideshow.
The advantage of displaying your images in a Web gallery (compared to 
simply constructing one humongous page that shows all the images at their 
full file size) is that viewers who have slow Internet connections don’t have 
to wait for all the images to download. Even visitors who have fast Internet 
connections will appreciate not being inundated with a flood of images.
To create your Web gallery, follow these steps:
 
1. Select your desired images and choose Window➪Workspace➪Output.
 
 The Output panel appears.
 
2. Click the Web Gallery icon.
 
3. Select a template from the pop-up menu.
 
 Presets, such as Filmstrip and Slideshow, are available. I chose the 
Lightroom Flash Gallery template, as shown in Figure 4-21. Photoshop 
will automatically select the Style, based on your chosen template.
 
4. (Optional) To get an idea of what the template will look like, click the 
Refresh Preview button.
 
 You can also click Preview in Browser to see how your Web gallery 
looks in your default Web browser.

Bridge.

Figure 4-21: Specify your desired options in the Web Photo Gallery dialog box.
 
5. In the Site Info area, specify your desired site, gallery titles, and 
description. Also, enter your contact info and e-mail or Web address, 
if desired. If you want everyone to know that your Web gallery is 
copyrighted, tell them so.
 
 Be aware that putting an e-mail link on a Web page invites spam. So, be 
sure to have your e-mail client’s spam filter on full bore if you plan to 
include your e-mail address.
 
6. Specify the colors you want for your text, headers, menu, background, 
border, and controls.
 
 I left mine at the default colors.
 
7. In the Appearance area, specify whether you want your Web page to 
be laid out as scrolling, left-aligned, paginated, or a slideshow.
 
 I chose paginated so that visitors can navigate through the site by page.
 
8. Select the size of your preview and thumbnails.

9. In the Create Gallery section, click either Save to Disk or Upload.
 
 If you select Save to Disk, click Browse to navigate to the location where 
you want to save your Web gallery files. Then, click Save.
 
 If you select Upload, enter the FTP server address, your user name, your

Chapter 5: Customizing Your 
Workspace and Preferences
In This Chapter
✓ Saving your workspace as a preset
✓ Customizing keyboard shortcuts and menus
✓ Defining preferences in Photoshop
✓ Managing settings with the Preset Manager
N
ow, more than ever, Photoshop lets you have it your way without 
having to make a trip down to the local burger shack. You can easily 
customize the look of your workspace, specifying everything from the loca-
tion of panels to the arrangement of dialog boxes when you begin a session. 
You can even store these physical layouts and recall them anytime you 
like. And, in addition to customizing your keyboard shortcuts, you can also 
customize your menus to highlight certain workflow 
commands.
Photoshop also makes it easy to choose how 
certain tools and features operate. You can choose 
how the cursors for tools such as brushes look, 
tell Photoshop your preferred way of storing files, 
and specify just how much memory you want to 
set aside for image editing. You can set all these 
preferences once and then forget them, or you can 
change them from time to time when your needs 
change. This chapter shows you how to customize 
your workspace and preferences so that Photoshop 
works your way.
Creating Workspace Presets
Photoshop is a complicated program; the more you learn, the more compli-
cated (and routine) your activities become. For one project, you may find 
yourself using the Styles panel repeatedly to add special effects to layers. 
For your next project, you may never use the Styles panel but require fre-
quent access to the Paths panel to create curves that you use to make selec-
tions. And so it goes.

98
Creating Workspace Presets
 
Use custom workspaces to save time and effort, or to instantly clean up a 
messy desktop.
Custom workspaces come in handy if you share a computer with students, 
family members, or coworkers. Those who prepare images for both Web and 
print have different needs that may call for special workspaces, too.
You can start with one of the many preset workspaces. Photoshop CS4 offers 
preset workspaces for various workflows, such as retouching, Web design, 
working with type, and many others. These presets can modify menu and/or 
keyboard shortcuts. They can also modify which panels are visible. You can 
select a preset, then establish your panel preferences, and save the modified 
workspace as your own custom workspace. Read on to find out how.
You can tailor your workspace in these ways:
 
✓ Combine panels to group together the ones you use most often. Drag 
a panel’s tab into another panel group to add it to that group. If the 
Layers, Channels, and History panels are the ones you use most often, 
you might want to group them together. You can collapse panels that 
you rarely use down to space-saving icons, minimize them to just their 
title bars, or close them altogether.
 
 Before saving your workspace preset, show or minimize, collapse, or 
close the panels (however you prefer them) and move them to the loca-
tions you want on your screen.
 
✓ Position dialog boxes. Although they don’t save with the workspace, 
per se, Photoshop’s Menu bar dialog boxes pop up in the same location 
they appeared the last time you used them. You may want to drag them 
to a specific place on your screen so that they appear there every time. 
When I’m working with a large image, I sometimes position dialog boxes 
on the screen of my second monitor to maximize the area for the image 
on my main display.
 
✓ Customize the Options bar. You can grab the gripper bar at the left 
edge of the Options bar and drag it to another location. For example, 
you can dock the bar on the right, along with your other panels, or have 
it float in a specific place on your Photoshop desktop. Photoshop stores 
these settings with your workspace preset.
 
✓ Set Photoshop’s font size. You can change the size of the font for text that’s 
displayed on the Options bar and panels. Choose Edit➪Preferences➪
Interface (Photoshop➪Preferences➪Interface on the Mac). Select Small, 
Medium, or Large from the UI Font Size pop-up menu in the Interface dialog 
box. The change takes place the next time you start Photoshop.
 
Note that other settings concerning the appearance of screen modes, menu 
colors, and the actions of panels are located in the Preferences settings, 
described in the section “Setting Your Preferences,” later in this chapter.

Customizing Keyboard Shortcuts
Saving and Deleting Workspace Presets
After you set up your custom workspace, you can save it by choosing 
Window➪Workspace➪Save Workspace. In the Save Workspace dialog box 
that appears, type a name for your saved workspace.
You have the additional options of 
selecting which components — panel 
locations, keyboard shortcuts, and 
menus — you want to capture in 
your custom workspace, as shown 
in Figure 5-1. After you check your 
desired settings, click the Save button.
Your saved workspace now appears as 
a listing on the Workspace submenu.
Want to return to the way Adobe sees the world of Photoshop? Choose 
Window➪Workspace➪Essentials (Default).
To delete a saved workspace, choose Window➪Workspace➪Delete 
Workspace. In the Delete Workspace dialog box that appears, select the 
name of the workspace you want to remove from the drop-down list. Click 
the Delete button, and your preset is gone, gone, gone.
You can save a workspace, as well as delete it or select a preset, by clicking 
the handy new Workspace button on the right side of the Applications bar. 
The Workspace button displays the name of the current workspace. Simply 
click the down-pointing arrow and make your selection from the submenu.
Customizing Keyboard Shortcuts
For those of you who are like me — I avoid using a mouse, and prefer the ease 
and speed of keyboard shortcuts — Photoshop offers customizable keyboard 
shortcuts. You can assign shortcuts to menu commands, panel commands, 
and tools. You can edit, delete, or add to the Photoshop default set or create 
your own custom set. Follow these steps to customize keyboard shortcuts:
 
1. Choose Edit➪Keyboard Shortcuts In the Keyboard Shortcuts and 
Menus dialog box that appears (see Figure 5-2), make sure the 
Keyboard Shortcuts tab is selected.
 
 You can also choose Window➪Workspace➪Keyboard Shortcuts & Menus.
 
2. Select your desired set of keyboard shortcuts from the pop-up menu.
 
 You can also create a new set by clicking the New Set button (the disk 
with a down-pointing arrow icon).
Figure 5-1: Select which components to 
save in your custom workspace.

100
Customizing Keyboard Shortcuts
Figure 5-2: Customize keyboard shortcuts for enhanced productivity.
 
 Clicking New Set makes a copy of the selected set for you to then edit 
and customize. If you create a new set, name the set (leaving it with a 
.kys extension) and keep it stored in the Keyboard Shortcuts folder.
 
3. Select Application Menus, Panel Menus, or Tools from the Shortcuts 
For drop-down list.
 
 Click the triangle next to the menu heading to expand the particular 
menu headings.
 
4. Select your desired command from the list. Type the shortcut keys you 
want to assign to that command in the shortcut field.
 
 If a shortcut has already been assigned to that command, you can 
simply type over it.
 
 If the keyboard shortcut you type is already being used, Photoshop 
warns you that if you accept the shortcut, it’ll be removed from the 
original command.
 
5. Click Accept to assign the shortcut to the command or tool.
 
 If you later change your mind and want to use the original keyboard 
shortcut (if there was one), click Use Default. If you decide you don’t 
want the shortcut at all, click Delete Shortcut. And if you make a mis-
take, just click Redo.

 Application and Panel menu commands must include a Ctrl (Ô on the 
Mac) and/or a Function (F) key in the keyboard shortcut.
 
6. When you finish, click the Save Set button (the disk icon).
 
 If you want to delete the set, click the Delete Set button (the trash icon).
 
7. Click the Summarize button to save the keyboard shortcut set as an 
.htm file, which loads in your Internet browser.
 
 You can then print the file and keep it as a handy reference of your 
shortcuts.
 
8. Click OK to exit the dialog box.
Customizing Menus
Adobe takes the customization club to yet another level by adding the ability 
to customize menus. You have the choice of colorizing chosen menu items 
or hiding the menu items altogether, as shown in Figure 5-3.
Figure 5-3: Colorize menu items that you frequently access for quicker identification.

102
Setting Your Preferences
Follow these steps to make the Photoshop menus your own:
 
1. Choose Edit➪Menus.
 
 You can also choose Window➪Workspace➪Keyboard Shortcuts & Menus.
 
 The Keyboard Shortcuts and Menus dialog box appears (refer to 
Figure 5-3).
 
2. Click the Menus tab, and in the Set drop-down list at the top, select the 
Photoshop Defaults set or another preset.
 
 Or to create a new menu, click the New Set button (the disk with a down-
pointing arrow icon).
 
 Clicking New Set makes a copy of the selected set for you to then edit 
and customize. If you select a new set, name the set (leaving it with a 
.mnu extension), and keep it stored in the Menu Customization folder.
 
3. Select Application Menus or Panel Menus from the Menu For drop-
down list. Click the triangle to expand the individual menu headings.
 
4. Select one of the following options for your desired command:
 
• Visibility: To hide or show a menu item, click the Visibility button.
 
 Be careful not to hide the really critical commands, such as Open 
or Save.
 
• Color Swatch: To add color to a menu item, click the Color Swatch 
(or the word None) and select a color from the drop-down list.
 
5. When you finish making changes, click the Save All Changes to the 
Current Set of Menus button (the disk icon).
 
 To delete a menu set, click the Delete Set button (trash icon).
 
 Or, to create a new set based on the current menu, click the Create a 
New Set Based on the Current Set of Menus button.
 
6. In the Save dialog box, enter a name for the set and click Save.
 
7. Click OK to exit the dialog box.
 
If you’ve hidden some menu items and decide you want to temporarily show 
them while working in Photoshop, choose Show All Menu Items from the 
menu that has the hidden items.
 
To turn off menu colors (they’re on by default), choose Edit➪Preferences➪
Interface (Photoshop➪Preferences➪Interface on the Mac) and deselect 
Show Menu Colors.
Setting Your Preferences
Photoshop stores settings for many different options in various Preferences 
files on your hard drive. The first time you run Photoshop after a new instal-
lation, you probably want to customize preferences to suit your own needs.

103
Book I
Chapter 5
Customizing Your 
Workspace and 
Preferences
Setting Your Preferences
You can access the Preferences dialog box by choosing Edit➪Preferences 
(Photoshop➪Preferences on the Mac). The first category of settings that 
appear in the submenu are the General Preferences (shown in Figure 5-4). 
You can choose any of the other Preferences categories from the submenu.
Figure 5-4: The General Preferences dialog box specifies a lot of the 
“look and feel” of your Photoshop interface.
After you’re in any Preferences dialog box, you can move between the 
dialog boxes by clicking the Prev or Next buttons that appear in each of the 
Preferences dialog boxes. If you like keyboard shortcuts, you can switch to 
the other Preferences dialog boxes by pressing Ctrl+1, Ctrl+2 (Ô+1, Ô+2 on 
the Mac), and so forth. The following sections give you a rundown of what 
you can do with the settings in the different Preferences dialog boxes.
Setting general preferences
The General Preferences dialog box is where you select some options that are, 
well, general in nature. You can select some choices from drop-down lists, and 
others are check boxes you can select or deselect to activate or disable that 
option. Here’s a rundown of options in the upper part of the dialog box:
 
✓ Color Picker: Use the familiar Adobe Color Picker to select precise colors 
or work with the Windows or Macintosh system color pickers, as desired. 
You might want to use the Windows or Apple color picker, for example, 
if you’ve previously defined some custom colors outside Photoshop and 
now want to make them available for a Photoshop project.
 
✓ Image Interpolation: When Photoshop resizes an image, it must either 
create new pixels (when making the image larger) or combine exist-
ing pixels (to make the image smaller). To do this, the program exam-
ines neighboring pixels and uses the information to derive the new or 

104
Setting Your Preferences
replacement pixels. You can select the type of mathematical algorithm 
Photoshop uses to do this, though you likely want to stick with the 
default option, Bicubic (Best for Smooth Gradients). You can find out 
more about interpolation and the other algorithms in Book II, Chapter 1.
In the Options section of the General Preferences dialog box, you find nearly 
a dozen check boxes that you can select or deselect, as described in the fol-
lowing list:
 
✓ Auto-Update Open Documents: When you’re working on an image and 
move to another application to work on the same image, you’ll probably 
want the changes made in the other application to reflect in the docu-
ment still open in Photoshop. Select this check box so that Photoshop 
monitors the document and updates its version whenever the document 
is changed in the other application.
 
✓ Beep When Done: I remember the bad old days when computers were 
slow and Photoshop would take a minute or two to apply the Gaussian 
Blur filter or perform calculations when merging even moderate-sized 
image layers. The Beep When Done signal was my cue to stop watching 
television and resume working with Photoshop. Although most opera-
tions are a lot faster today, if you’re working with very large images or 
simply like to be notified when a step is finished, the beep option can be 
useful (or incredibly annoying to your coworkers).
 
✓ Dynamic Color Sliders: The sliders in the Color panel change colors to 
match the settings you make. If your computer is on the slow side, you 
can turn off this feature to improve performance.
 
✓ Export Clipboard: When this feature is active, Photoshop transfers its pri-
vate clipboard (used only within Photoshop) to the general Windows or 
Macintosh Clipboard so that you can paste information into other applica-
tions. If you activate this option, switching from Photoshop to other appli-
cations takes a little longer, and Photoshop’s clipboard contents replace 
whatever was in your system Clipboard when you switched.
 
 The clipboard is generally a poor vehicle for moving image data between 
applications because the transferred information may not be of the best 
quality. Instead, save your file and open it in the other application. If you 
do this, you can turn off the Export Clipboard option, saving you some 
time when switching between applications.
 
✓ Use Shift Key for Tool Switch: When this feature is active, you can 
change from one tool in the Tools panel to another in the same flyout 
menu (say, to change from the Gradient tool to the Paint Bucket tool) by 
pressing the Shift key and the keyboard shortcut for that tool.
 
✓ Resize Image During Paste/Place: By default, when you place or paste 
files that are larger than the document they’re being pasted or placed 
into, the files are resized to fit. Uncheck this option to have the file 
import with its exact dimensions, as shown in Figure 5-5.

✓ Animated Zoom: This option enables you to zoom in smoothly, rather 
than in increments, when holding down the mouse button or pressing 
Ctrl+plus/equal sign (+/=) (Ô+plus/equal sign [+/=] on the Mac).
 
✓ Zoom Resizes Windows: Select this check box if you want your docu-
ment windows to grow and shrink to fit your document while you zoom 
in and out. Deselect this check box if you want the document’s window 
to always remain the same size; you might want to deselect the check 
box if you frequently work with several documents side by side and 
don’t want them to change relative size while you zoom in and out.
 
✓ Zoom Clicked Point to Center: If selected, when you click the Zoom 
tool at a specific location, that location then becomes the center of your 
image window.
 
✓ Zoom with Scroll Wheel: This handy option enables your mouse scroll 
wheel to become a zooming tool, regardless of which tool you’re using.
 
✓ Enable Flick Panning: If selected, when you quickly drag and release with 
the Hand tool, the image continues to move, slowly decelerating to a stop.
In the History Log section, you can have Photoshop record all your editing 
commands. The History Log feature is handy if you want to present a finished, 

106
Setting Your Preferences
fully edited image to a client or manager, but need to be able to show the 
steps of how you got there. Or maybe you want a record of the steps, so you 
can repeat them on other images and don’t want to rely on your memory.
You have a few formats in which you can save your history log:
 
✓ Metadata: Saving the log to metadata (information embedded in your image 
file) allows you to view the log in the Bridge window and in the History tab 
of the File➪File Info dialog box. For more on Bridge, see Book I, Chapter 4.
 
✓ Text File: You can save the log to a text file. Click the Choose button to 
provide a name and location for the file.
 
✓ Both: This option saves the log as both metadata and a text file.
 
✓ Edit Log Items: You select Sessions Only, Concise, or Detailed. The Sessions 
Only option records your editing until you close the file or quit Photoshop. 
The Concise option keeps a comprehensive log (multiple sessions), but 
in short and sweet steps. The Detailed option provides a comprehensive, 
detailed log. For example, a concise log entry may be just Crop, whereas 
a detailed log entry may be Crop to rectangle, also providing the origi-
nal and cropped dimensions, the angle, and the resolution values.
The last option in the General Preferences dialog box is the Reset All 
Warning Dialogs button. If you’ve turned off the display of certain warnings 
by selecting the Don’t Show Me This Dialog Box Again check box, you can 
reactivate all the warnings by clicking this button.
Customizing the interface
The Interface preferences, shown in Figure 5-6, deal with the “look” of 
Photoshop. Here’s the scoop:
 
✓ Screen Modes: When using the Application Frame, you can select the 
color of the background around your image. You can also select whether 
your image edge is surrounded by a line, drop shadow, or nothing at all.
 
✓ Use Grayscale Application icon: Check this setting to convert the Ps 
icon at the tip of the toolbar to grayscale rather than color.
 
✓ Show Channels in Color: When selected, this option tells Photoshop 
to show each of the color channels (for example, Red, Green, and Blue; 
or Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black) in their respective colors in the 
Channels panel. In most cases, you don’t want to use this feature. You 
need to be able to see the channels in their grayscale form to perform 
image-editing tasks such as converting from color to grayscale or chan-
nel masking, or for selective sharpening on certain channels. Book VI, 
Chapter 1 introduces channels.
 
✓ Show Menu Colors: Check this option to have the ability to view cus-
tomized menus in color.

107

Setting Your Preferences
 
✓ Show Tool Tips: Photoshop can display little pop-up reminders about 
tools and other objects on your screen. If you find these reminders dis-
tracting, deselect this check box to turn off tool tips.
 
✓ Auto-Collapse Iconic Panels: If checked, panels automatically collapse 
down to just their icons when you click somewhere else within the 
Photoshop application.
 
✓ Auto-Show Hidden Panels: If checked, this option automatically shows 
any hidden panels.
 
✓ Remember Panel Locations: Select this check box if you want 
Photoshop to restore your most recent panel locations the next time 
you start up. Deselect this check box if you always want your panels in 
the same location each time you begin working.
 
✓ Open Documents as Tabs: Selecting this new option opens documents 
tabbed to the Application Frame. If you uncheck this option, images 
“float,” like in previous versions of Photoshop.
 
✓ Enable Floating Document Window Docking: Lets you dock floating 
document windows as tabs when dragging one document window to 
another document window. Holding down Ctrl (Control on the Mac) 
while dragging a floating window also temporarily turns on the prefer-
ence while you’re working in Photoshop.
 
✓ UI Font Size: Specify the size of the text displayed in dialog boxes, 
panels, and so on. Select from Small, Medium, or Large.
Figure 5-6: The Interface preferences category specifies the “look” of Photoshop.
Deciding how you want files handled
The options in the File Handling Preferences dialog box, shown in Figure 5-7, 
control how Photoshop handles files when they’re opened and closed. Here’s 
the lowdown on these options:

108
Setting Your Preferences
Figure 5-7: The File Handling Preferences dialog box offers settings 
for opening and saving files.
 
✓ Image Previews: Storing a preview thumbnail with an image can speed 
up browsing for the image you want. You can tell Photoshop to save a 
preview by default or to ask you first (in case you want to create images 
that are a little smaller in size, especially for the Web). Or you can also 
choose not to ever save a preview. Mac users need to select the kinds of 
image previews they need. Select the Icon option to enable an image icon 
to appear on the desktop. Select the Macintosh Thumbnail option to see 
a preview in the Open dialog box. Select the Windows Thumbnail option 
to see a preview in a Windows OS dialog box. Finally, select the Full Size 
option to save a low-resolution version of the file to use in applications 
that can open only low-resolution (72 ppi) Photoshop images.
 
✓ File Extension: You can select whether the file extensions appended to 
filenames (such as .psd, .tif, and so forth) are consistently uppercase 
or lowercase, as you prefer. On the Mac, you can choose whether to add 
extensions by selecting from the Always, Never, or Ask When Saving 
options. If you want cross-platform compatibility with PCs or you’re cre-
ating Web graphics, select the Always option. Mac users, select the Use 
Lower Case option to save extensions as lowercase characters.
 
✓ Camera Raw Preferences: Here are the details on these preferences, as 
shown in Figure 5-8:
 
• When a Camera Raw (CR) file is processed, the image settings can 
be saved in two different places — a sidecar .xmp file or a Camera 
Raw database file. Create a separate sidecar .xmp file if you want to 
archive your images or exchange them with other people because 
it’s a collaborative workflow. If you archive the files to a CD or DVD, 
copy them to a hard drive before opening them because CR can’t 
write an XMP file to read-only media. If you store your setting to a 
CR database file, the settings are saved in the folder Document and 
Settings/[username]/Application Data/Adobe/CameraRaw 
(Users/[user name]/Library/Preferences on the Mac).

109
Book I
Chapter 5
Customizing Your 
Workspace and 
Preferences
Setting Your Preferences
Figure 5-8: Establish preferences for Camera Raw images.
 
• When you reopen a CR image, the image settings you used when 
the file was last opened are reapplied. Select which Default Image 
Settings you want applied. The only settings that aren’t stored are 
color profile, bit depth, pixel dimensions, and resolution.
 
• The cache in Camera Raw stores data for file thumbnails, meta-
data and file info. You can choose to increase the cache, if desired. 
Note that 1GB holds data for around 200 images. If your cache gets 
bloated or corrupted, clicking the Purge Cache button deletes the 
data.
 
• DNG stands for Digital Negative, a popular format for storing CR 
images. DNG image settings are usually embedded in the file itself. If 
you want to stick with the norm, check the Ignore Sidecar .xmp file 
option. If you want a JPEG preview of your image, check the option 
and select from a Medium or Full Size preview.
 
• Another important setting is the JPEG and TIFF Handling option. 
Camera Raw (CR) enables you to open and edit both JPEGs and TIFFs. 
If you select Automatically Open All Supported JPEGs (or TIFFs), any 
JPEG or TIFF automatically opens in CR, rather than Photoshop. If you 
select Automatically Open JPEGs (or TIFFs) with Settings, CR opens 
any JPEG or TIFF with Camera Raw (crs) tags. So, any files that you 
have previously opened and edited, then closed by clicking Done in 
CR, will open in CR. Because working with Camera Raw images can be 
a little complex, Adobe offers a lot of documentation and videos on 
working with these types of images. Check www.adobe.com.

Setting Your Preferences
 
✓ Prefer Adobe Camera Raw for Supported Raw Files: Select this setting 
to have ACR open any and all Raw file formats supported by Photoshop.
 
✓ Ignore EXIF Profile Tag: When this option is selected, Photoshop ignores 
the sRGB tag that many digital cameras add to their EXIF (camera) data. 
The sRGB tag is widely used by digital cameras, but it’s not well respected 
among many high-end digital photography professionals.
 
✓ Ask Before Saving Layered TIFF Files: Photoshop can save an advanced 
type of TIFF file that includes layers, exactly like with its own native PSD 
files. However, many applications can’t read these files. If you always 
open TIFF files in Photoshop, or you’re using recent versions of other 
Creative Suite applications that can accept layered TIFFs and you don’t 
mind creating larger TIFF files in the process, you can disable this 
option. Otherwise, Photoshop asks you for confirmation each time you 
want to save a TIFF file that contains layers.
 
✓ Maximize PSD File and PSB File Compatibility: Photoshop lets you 
choose an option for file compatibility.
 
 Not all applications can handle the more sophisticated features that may 
be stored in a PSD file (such as fancy layer effects). If you frequently 
open PSD files in applications other than later versions of Photoshop, 
you may want to set this option to Always. Keep in mind that you may 
lose some features when you choose this option. Select Ask to have 
Photoshop prompt you when you save a file about whether you want to 
apply the option. Or select Never to ignore the option completely.
 
 When you maximize compatibility, Photoshop saves a composite (flat-
tened) version along with the layered file to ensure that older applica-
tions (such as Version 2) can read the files. However, this option can 
make your file size balloon significantly.
 
 The PSB (large file) format is like the PSD format in that it supports most 
Photoshop features. Currently, only Photoshop cs and higher can open 
PSB files. Again, keeping this option checked ensures maximum compat-
ibility with any future programs that may accept this format.
 
 If you plan to use your PSD files in InDesign or Illustrator, you should 
have the Maximize Compatibility feature selected because the perfor-
mance of these programs is faster when you have a composite along 
with the layers, especially with large files that have a lot of layers.
 
✓ Enable Version Cue: Select this option if your computer is located on a 
network and you need to share your files with others in your workgroup 
by using a server.
 
✓ Recent File List Contains: Type a value from 0 to 30 to specify the 
number of recently used files you want displayed in the Open Recent list 
on the File menu.

Handling performance options
Everything you need to specify Photoshop’s performance can be found in 
this dialog box. Here are the options, as shown in Figure 5-9:
 
✓ Memory Usage: The perennial question: How much memory does 
Photoshop require? The perennial answer: As much as you can cram 
into your computer! Memory is so inexpensive right now that you have 
no excuse for not having at least a gigabyte of RAM, and more is even 
better if you’re using an operating system that can handle extra memory 
efficiently, such as Windows XP or Vista, or Mac OS X. Version CS4 runs 
at its best with at least two gigabytes of RAM.
 
 When you cram your RAM, you want to make sure Photoshop can use 
as much as you can spare. You can use the Memory Usage slider, shown 
in Figure 5-9, to allocate your memory. Use a value of 50 to 80 percent, 
depending on how much memory you have to waste. Allocating more to 
Photoshop reduces the RAM for other applications, so if you have other 
programs that need a lot of memory, select a prudent value.
 
✓ History States: Photoshop remembers how your document looks at vari-
ous stages of editing, storing all the image information on your hard drive 
and listing the individual states in the History panel. (For more information 
on using the History panel, see Book II, Chapter 4.) Keeping track of every 
change you make requires a lot of memory and hard drive space, so you 
can specify how many resources to use by typing a value into this box. The 
default is 20 (the max is 1000). If you have resources to burn and frequently 
find yourself stepping way back in time to modify or delete a step, you can 
type a larger number. If your resources are skimpy and you don’t anticipate 
making many changes to earlier steps (or are willing to take frequent snap-
shots or save interim images), you can enter a smaller number.
Figure 5-9: Adjust the Memory Usage setting to allocate the maximum 
amount of RAM Photoshop gobbles up.

112
Setting Your Preferences
 
✓ Cache levels: You can set aside the amount of memory for storing 
screen images in the Cache levels setting, to speed up redraws of a 
reduced-view image on your screen while you make changes. You can 
specify the number of copies of your image stored in memory, from the 
default value of 4 up to 8 levels.
 
✓ Scratch disks: Scratch disks are areas on your hard drive that 
Photoshop uses to substitute for physical RAM when you don’t have 
enough RAM to work with the images you open. Scratch disks are no 
replacement for physical memory, but Photoshop needs scratch disks 
many times, even if you have huge amounts of memory.
 
 Photoshop uses your startup drive (the drive used to boot your oper-
ating system) as its first scratch disk by default. That may not be the 
best choice because your startup drive is usually pretty busy handling 
requests of your operating system and, if you’re running Windows, 
requests for the Windows virtual memory scheme (your so-called swap 
file or paging file). Ideally, your scratch disk(s) should be a different 
hard drive and, preferably, the fastest one you have available.
 
 If you have more than one hard drive, select one other than your startup 
drive as your first scratch disk.
 
 If you don’t have a second hard drive, you can improve scratch disk per-
formance by creating a partition on an existing drive for use as a scratch 
disk. Remember to keep the scratch disk defragmented (that is, with the 
files all organized together on your hard drive) by using your favorite 
defragmentation utility.
 
✓ GPU Settings: Photoshop attempts to auto-detect your video card and 
lists the make and model. Check Enable OpenGL Drawing to enhance the 
performance of your graphics display and speed up your screen redraw. 
If some of your tool cursors don’t appear while you edit an image, try 
unchecking this option to see whether it fixes the problem. Note that 
you need to check this option to enable viewing options such as flick 
panning, animated zooms, and the Rotate View tool.
Adjusting your cursors
The Cursors Preferences dialog box, shown in Figure 5-10, enables you to set 
several options that control how cursors display on-screen. The following 
list describes these options:

Figure 5-10: Choose the way your cursors are displayed — from 
crosshairs to brush tips.
 
✓ Painting and Other Cursors (shown in Figure 5-11): 
Select the Standard option to show a tool’s cursor as 
an icon representing the tool itself (although I don’t 
know why you’d want to do this). Here’s the low-
down on the other settings:
 
• Precise: Switches to a cursor that has crosshairs, 
which is useful for positioning the center of a 
tool’s operational area in a particular place.
 
• Normal Brush Tip: Displays a 50% point for the 
brush tip, which means that the diameter of the 
brush tip reflects feathering of 50% or more. The 
wispier feathered areas of 50% or less are outside 
the diameter area shown.
 
• Full Size Brush Tip: Displays the full size of the 
diameter of the brush tip.
 
• Show Cross Hair in Brush Tip: A great hybrid. It 
shows a cross hair in the center of either of the 
brush tips — great for precision retouching.
 
 Most users prefer to set the painting cursors to 
Normal or Full Size Brush Tip and the other cursors 
to Precise. Some folks do complain that precise cur-
sors are hard to see against some backgrounds, but 
you can always press the Caps Lock key to toggle 
precise cursors on or off.
 
✓ Brush Preview: To change the color of your brush 
editing preview, click the color swatch, which takes 
you to the Color Picker, where you can select your 
desired color.

Adjusting transparency and gamut
Photoshop uses colors and patterns to represent information about an 
image that’s normally invisible, such as areas that are transparent or parts 
of an image that contain colors that can’t be represented by your current 
display or printing system. The Transparency & Gamut Preferences dialog 
box, shown in Figure 5-12, enables you to tailor these displays to your own 
preferences.
Figure 5-12: Specify how transparency and out-of-gamut (meaning out-of-range) 
colors are displayed in the Transparency & Gamut Preferences dialog box.
For example, transparency is typically shown on-screen by using a gray-and-
white checkerboard pattern. You can change the pattern and colors if you 
prefer another type of display.
Here’s a rundown of the options you find in this dialog box:
 
✓ Grid Size: You can choose small, medium, large, or no grid at all. You 
may want to switch from the default medium-sized grid to a large grid if 
you’re using a very high-resolution setting (such as the 1920 x 1440 pixel 
setting I use on my monitor) so the grid is a little easier to see. (I don’t 
bother with this, myself.) Or you can switch to a smaller grid if you’re 
working at a 640 x 480 or an 800 x 600 resolution.
 
✓ Grid Colors: The default light grid is the least obtrusive, but you can 
switch to a medium or dark grid, if you want. Also, you’re not limited to 
gray-and-white checkerboard squares. To select custom colors, click the 
white and gray squares below the Grid Colors list.
 
✓ Gamut Warning: You can adjust the color used to represent out-of-
gamut colors and to specify the transparency for the warning color. 
Double-click the Color box to set the hue and select the transparency 
with the Opacity slider. The gamut warning is generally used before con-
verting RGB images to CMYK to see which colors will be lost. For more 
information on color gamuts, see Book II, Chapter 2.

A gamut is the range of colors that can be displayed or printed. In Photoshop 
talk, out-of-gamut colors generally are those that can’t be represented by 
cyan, magenta, yellow, and black and, therefore, can’t be printed. To turn 
gamut warnings on or off, choose View➪Gamut Warning. I recommend leav-
ing the gamut warning on. That way, you know what’s happening with your 
image’s colors.
Setting measurement preferences
In the Units & Rulers Preferences dialog box, shown in Figure 5-13, you can 
set the units used to measure things on-screen (inches, pixels, millimeters, 
and so forth) and to define a default column size when typing text in multiple 
columns. In addition, you can define the resolution of the image when you 
choose File➪New and select a preset from the Preset Sizes list. (See Book I, 
Chapter 3 for more on preset sizes.)
Figure 5-13: Specify your units of measurement and default Photoshop 
resolution settings in the Units & Rulers Preferences dialog box.
In the Units area of the dialog box, you find these options:
 
✓ Rulers: Select the measurement units that Photoshop uses for rulers. 
Your choices are pixels, inches, centimeters, millimeters, points, picas, 
or percent. The most popular units are inches and millimeters, but if 
you’re working with publications and specifying in picas, you might 
prefer that increment instead. If you’re prepping Web graphics, you may 
prefer to have your rulers incremented in pixels.
 
✓ Type: Select the measurement used to represent the dimensions of type. 
Point size is almost universally used, but pixels and millimeters are also 
available. You may want to use pixels if you’re trying to fit type into a 
specific-sized area of an image.

116
Setting Your Preferences
In the Column Size area, you can specify the following:
 
✓ Width: The width of the column in inches, centimeters, millimeters, 
points, or picas
 
✓ Gutter: The width of the area separating columns, also in inches, centi-
meters, millimeters, points, or picas
In the New Document Preset Resolutions area, you can set the following:
 
✓ Print Resolution: The default is 300 pixels per inch, a good overall print 
setting to keep. You can change to another value and use pixels per cen-
timeter as a measurement, if you want. Note that this resolution setting 
affects the Photo, International Paper, and U.S. Paper presets found in 
the New dialog box.
 
✓ Screen Resolution: Generally, 72 pixels per inch works with most images 
that are prepped for screen viewing. You can select another resolution 
and use pixels per centimeter, if you like. This resolution setting affects 
the Web, and Film and Video, presets found in the New dialog box.
 
Changing the resolution of an image after you created it can impact the 
sharpness of your image and degrade quality. Choosing the final resolution 
you want when you create a document is best, whether you specify the reso-
lution manually or use these presets.
In the Point/Pica Size area, you can select whether you want to use a measure-
ment of 72 points per inch (which first became relevant in the Macintosh realm 
and spread as desktop publishing became widespread) or the traditional 72.27 
points per inch definition used in the pre-computer era. Unless you have a spe-
cial reason to choose otherwise, use the PostScript (72 points per inch) option.
Setting up guides, grids, and slices
Guides are nonprinting lines you can create on your screen to make it easier 
to align objects. Grids are vertical and horizontal lines in the background 
that make lining up objects even easier. Slices are sections of an image 
you can create for Web page graphics so that each slice can be loaded and 
treated separately (usually in a table or similar arrangement). For more 
information on using grids and guides, see Book I, Chapter 4. Figure 5-14 
shows the Guides, Grid & Slices Preferences dialog box.
In the Guides and Smart Guides area, you can set these options:
 
✓ Color: Either select a color from the drop-down list or click the color 
sample swatch to select your own color. You may want to change the 
default color if that color is too similar to a dominant color in your image.
 
✓ Style (for guides only): Select from lines or dashed lines. If you work 
with images that contain many horizontal and vertical lines that extend 
across most of an image, dashed lines may be more visible.

In the Slices area, these are your choices:
 
✓ Line Color: From the drop-down list, select a color for the lines that sur-

✓ Show Slice Numbers: If you select this check box, Photoshop adds a 
slice number to the display of slices, which makes it easier to keep track 
of individual slices.

Introduction for details about this book’s companion Web site.
Adding plug-ins
Plug-ins are mini software programs that add features to Photoshop. The 
Plug-Ins folder is where Photoshop stores all your filters and other plug-in 
add-ons. A default folder is created when you install Photoshop.
Photoshop allows you to specify an additional folder to search other than 
its own Plug-Ins folder. This additional folder may come in handy if you want 
to keep your third-party add-ons separate from Photoshop’s native plug-ins. 

118
Setting Your Preferences
An auxiliary plug-ins directory (not nested within Photoshop’s own Plug-Ins 
folder) can simplify managing those extra filters, and you can turn off their 
use (potentially speeding up Photoshop’s load time) by deselecting the 
Additional Plug-Ins Folder check box in this dialog box, as shown in Figure 
5-15. You can also use this option when you have some plug-ins installed for 
another application and want to share them with Photoshop without having 
to make extra copies in your Photoshop Plug-Ins directory.
Figure 5-15: Plug-ins, like filters, add features to Photoshop.
Here are a couple tips on using plug-ins:
 
✓ To activate a new plug-ins folder: Select the Additional Plug-Ins Folder 
check box. In the dialog box that appears, navigate to the folder you 
want to use and select it. Click Choose. You then need to exit Photoshop 
and restart the program to activate the new directory.
 
✓ If you have a plug-in or folder you want to deactivate: Use a tilde (~) as 
the first character of the plug-in or folder name. Photoshop ignores the 
plug-in(s) or folder(s) specified. Just remove the tilde from the name to 
activate the plug-in or folder. This can come in handy if you’re having 
a program glitch and want to deactivate your plug-ins to troubleshoot 
whether they’re causing the problem.
 
Adobe changed the format for serial numbers with Photoshop 7, and if you 
have old plug-ins that require a valid Photoshop serial number, you can 
enter the serial number from an older version into the space provided in this 
dialog box.
Specifying type options
The Type preferences enable you to establish your font options, shown in 
Figure 5-16, as follows:
 
✓ Use Smart Quotes: Smart quotes are the curly quotes that typographer’s 
use for quotation marks and apostrophes. Straight quotes should be 
used for abbreviations for feet and inches. I recommend leaving this 
option checked by default.

✓ Show Asian Text Options: If unchecked (the default), Photoshop hides

✓ Enable Missing Glyph Protection: If certain glyphs (characters) are 
missing, Photoshop makes a substitution if this option is checked.
 
✓ Show Font Names in English: Photoshop displays Asian font names in 
English if this option is selected (and you check the Show Asian Text 
Option).
 
✓ Font Preview Size: Specify whether you want a small, medium, or large 
font for the font menu display of your Type tool.
Figure 5-16: The Type preferences establish your typographic options.
Using the Preset Manager
Many of the panels and tools Photoshop works with can use settings that 
you store on your hard drive as presets. For example, you can create custom 
colors and brush tips, build your own gradients, create a library of shapes, 
or compile a set of styles to apply to layers.
You want to become familiar with 
the Preset Manager, which provides 
a central management tool for all the 
options that are individually available 
from the panels and tools themselves. 
Just like with the tools, you can select, 
edit, and delete presets. The only thing 
you can’t do with the Preset Manager 
is actually create a preset. You must do 
this with the Tool Preset Picker, Tool 
Presets panel, Gradient Editor, Brushes 
panel, and other locations. For more 
details, see Book I, Chapter 2. Here are 
some tips on using the Preset Manager, 
in Figure 5-17:
Figure 5-17: The Preset Manager is the 
central management tool for all Photoshop 
presets for all panels.

Using the Preset Manager
 
✓ To show the Preset Manager, choose Edit➪Preset Manager. To hide it, 
click Done.
 
✓ To select a specific type of preset to work with, select it from the Preset 
Type drop-down list.
 
✓ To load an existing set of presets from your hard drive, click the Load 
button and navigate to the presets you want to access. You can also 
select a preset library listed on the pop-up menu of each preset type.
 
✓ To store a new or modified group of settings, click the Save Set button 
and type a name.
 
✓ To give a particular preset a new name, select the preset in the dialog 
box, click the Rename button, type the new name, and click OK.
 
 You can rename multiple presets consecutively by clicking and Ctrl-
clicking (Ô-clicking) the items that you want to rename, then clicking 
the Rename button. Photoshop asks you to supply a new name for each, 
in turn.
 
✓ To quickly load the default preset library for any tool or panel, select 
Reset [Preset] from the Preset Manager pop-up menu. You can also 
replace your current preset library with another.
 
✓ Different preset display options are available on the Preset Manager 
pop-up menu.

Image Essentials

T
o me, when people say that a bit of informa-
tion is essential, they mean, “Hey, you really 
gotta know this stuff or else!” Well, technically, 
you could skip this book and Photoshop wouldn’t 
be any wiser, but I don’t recommend it. In this 
book, I cover the nitty-gritty of topics like resolu-
tion, image modes, and file formats. Fun? Nope. 
Dry? Most likely, unless you’re the type who gets 
excited about pixel dimensions. But having a good 
handle on the information in this book is critical 
to ensuring good-looking images.
I show you how to safely size your images without 
causing them to turn to mush. You can also find 
information on cropping images and increasing 
canvas sizes, as well as an important chapter on 
both applying color and color managing your files. 
If you want to know more about how to undo your 
mistakes, you’ll want to check out the chapter on 
the History panel. And finally, if all this information 
makes your head spin and you need a breather, 
look at the chapter on Actions. Actions can auto-
mate a lot of your frequently executed Photoshop 
techniques, giving you more time to stop and 
smell those roses you just photographed.

Chapter 1: Specifying Size 
and Resolution
In This Chapter
✓ Comparing pixel and vector images
✓ Understanding how pixels appear on different monitors
✓ Working with the Image Size command
✓ Resampling images (if you must)
✓ Adjusting the canvas size
✓ Cropping an image
S
ize and resolution are slippery subjects. A digital image’s size may refer 
to its file size, how big you want it to be on a 
printed page (such as 3 x 5 or 8 x 10 inches), the 
size you want it be on-screen (full screen or just 
part of the screen), or how densely packed the 
pixels are (its resolution). To use Photoshop’s 
tools so that an image looks good in print or on-
screen, you need to know not only what type 
of size you’re working with, but also what the 
image’s resolution is — and how both of these fac-
tors might affect the image’s appearance.
Given all the factors in size and resolution, it’s 
not surprising that Photoshop has evolved into a 
Swiss Army knife. It offers multiple tools for speci-
fying, viewing, or changing an image’s size. In this 
chapter, I give you a bit of background in both 
size and resolution so that you know what tools to 
use and how to use them. In Book IX, you can find 
out how to use the basics I cover here in order to tailor size and resolution 
specifically for print.
I also explain how to change image size without harming your image. Yes, 
you can harm your image. Not intentionally, of course. But it can happen 
quicker than you can close a dialog box. However, with a firm understand-
ing of how pixels live and breathe, you can ensure that your images are safe 
from damage.

Putting Images under the Microscope
Putting Images under the Microscope
Digital images fall into two camps — vector images, which are created by 
mathematical formulas, and raster images, which are made up of pixels 
arranged in a grid. Photoshop allows you to produce both types of images 
and even to combine both types within a single file.
Table 1-1 gives you the skinny on vector and raster images.

Even though Photoshop can produce vector graphics, its primary mission 
is to create awe-inspiring raster images. And because the issue of resolu-
tion is so critical to raster images, this chapter primarily discusses methods 
for sizing and resizing raster images. 
I cover producing vector art in more 
detail in Book IV, Chapter 1.
Vector images
One cool thing about vector images — 
also called object-oriented images — is 
that when you zoom in on them, they 
don’t look blocky. That’s because vector 
images are made of segments (whether 
curved or straight) and anchor points, 
which are elements that indicate the 
endpoints of the segments. Both seg-
ments and anchors are defined by math-
ematical objects called vectors. Vectors 
use a unique mathematical formula to 
define the specific location of an object, 
as well as its geometric shape. Vector 
images, one of which is shown in 
Figure 1-1, are usually the product of 
Figure 1-1: Graphics that need clean lines, 
such as logos, typographic illustrations, and 
line art — such as my logo — work great in 
vector format.

Chapter 1
Specifying Size 
and Resolution
Putting Images under the Microscope
drawing programs, such as Adobe Illustrator, but Photoshop is also capable of 
producing a vector or two.
Here are a few more handy things to know about vector graphics:
 
✓ A curve is still a curve, even at 20,000 feet. Because they’re mathemati-
cally defined, vector graphics can be sized and otherwise transformed 
without an inkling of quality loss. Take that little 2-inch spot illustration 
and size it up to mural size, and it appears identical.
 
✓ You can get pretty pictures in small packages. Vector-image files can be 
small because file size depends on the complexity of the vector objects, 
not on the size of the illustration.
 
✓ Vector images are independent — resolution-independent, that is. Not 
only can they be transformed and printed without degrading their qual-
ity, but they also have no built-in resolution — they take on the resolu-
tion of the output device. For example, if you print my logo in Figure 1-1 
to an imagesetter (a high-end printing device used for color separations) 
at 3600 dots per inch (dpi), the image comes out at 3600 dpi. Print it to a 
300-dpi laser printer, and what do you get? A 300-dpi image.
 
Because your monitor can display images only on a grid, vector images 
display on-screen as pixels. This accounts for the jagged appearance you 
sometimes see when you zoom into a curved vector object. But don’t worry; 
it prints just fine.
Raster images
Raster images are usually the result of the digitizing of continuous-tone 
images, such as photographs or original painted or drawn artwork. Raster 
images are made up of a grid of squares called pixels. (Pixel is short for 
picture element; it’s the smallest component of a digital image.) If you’ve 
ever looked at a bathroom wall made up of those small square tiles remi-
niscent of the ’40s, you’re familiar with what a grid of pixels looks like up 
close: Each pixel lives in a specific location on that grid, and each contains a 
single color. When you edit a raster image, you’re editing one or more pixels, 
rather than an object-oriented shape.
But how do you fit a round peg into a square hole? By faking it. Unlike the 
true mathematical curve that’s possible when you’re drawing vector shapes, 
raster images must try to approximate a curve by mimicking the overall 
shape with square pixels. So, the elliptical shapes of my beanie (shown in 
Figure 1-2) have to fit within this system of squares. Fortunately, the pixels’ 
mimicry is unnoticeable in high-resolution images viewed at a reasonable 
distance. But when you zoom in, you can see that a curve in an image (such 
as the curve of my beanie) is indeed made up of square pixels.

126
Viewing Raster Images On-Screen
Figure 1-2: Raster images are composed of a grid of square pixels.
 
Raster graphics work great for photorealistic or painterly images in which 
subtle gradations of color are necessary. On the downside, because they 
contain a fixed number of pixels, raster graphics can suffer a degradation of 
quality when they’re enlarged or otherwise transformed. They’re also large 
in file size.
 
Bitmap, another name for raster, images are resolution-dependent. Because 
they contain a fixed number of pixels, the resolution of the device they’re 
being printed to is only one of two factors that influence the quality of the 
image. The quality of the output also depends heavily on the resolution of 
the image. For example, an image with 72 dots per inch (dpi) doesn’t look 
any better printed on a 600-dpi printer than it does on a 1200-dpi printer. 
Likewise, a 300-dpi image doesn’t look as good printed on an old 72-dpi dot-
matrix printer as it does on a 1200-dpi printer.
Viewing Raster Images On-Screen
When you view images on-screen, pixel dimensions come into play — 
especially if you’re putting images on the Web — because the display of 
images is based on 1 image pixel per 1 screen pixel. The most important 
issue, then, is making sure that your image fits inside your (or your 
audience’s) monitor when viewed at 100 percent.
 
When you view an image on-screen, the display size is determined by the 
pixel dimension, plus the size and setting of the monitor. You therefore need 
to determine what monitor resolution your audience is likely using and size 
your graphics accordingly. Table 1-2 illustrates how an 800-x-600-pixel image 
might display differently, depending on monitor resolution.

How Does an 800-x-600-Pixel Image Display?
22-inch monitor
1680 x 1050
The image fills a small portion of the screen.
17-inch monitor
1024 x 768
The image fills part of the screen.
800 x 600
The image fills the screen, with each pixel 
appearing larger.
15-inch monitor
800 x 600
The image fills the screen.
Larger images can’t be viewed in their entirety.
You may also hear monitor resolution being referred to in graphic display 
standards, such as VGA (640 x 480 pixels), XGA (1024 x 768 pixels), UXGA 
(1600 x 1200 pixels), WQXGA (2560 x 1600 pixels), and so on.
 
Resolution is measured in pixels per inch, or ppi. You may also run across 
the term samples per inch (spi), often used when talking about scanners. 
Another term you see often is dots per inch (dpi), always used in reference 
to printers, imagesetters, and other paper-outputting devices. You may hear 
people refer to dpi as printer resolution.
 
When displaying images on-screen, the recommended resolution setting is 
somewhere between 72 ppi and 96 ppi, even though resolution isn’t really 
a factor in preparing screen images. That’s just because monitors display 
somewhere in the 72- to 96-ppi range.
So, if you change the physical dimensions of an image, it’s always at a one-to-
one ratio with the monitor. If you view an image whose resolution is higher 
than that of the monitor, the image appears larger on-screen than in print. 
For example, try opening (or dragging and dropping) a 300-ppi JPEG file into 
a browser window. It explodes on your screen. Because the monitor can dis-
play only 72 to 96 ppi, it needs a ton of space to show all the pixels.
Using the Image Size Command
A time will come when you need to mess with the resolution or dimensions 
of an image. You may want to
 
✓ Change the file size.
 
✓ Make sure the resolution is appropriate for print.
 
✓ Adjust the dimensions so that they’re just right for viewing on-screen.
 
✓ Change the width, height, and/or resolution of your image for printing or 
some other kind of output.

128
Using the Image Size Command
Photoshop — powerhouse that it is — allows you to size an image in all 
these ways with the Image Size command on the Image menu. Follow these 
steps to resize your image:
 
1. Open the image and then 
choose Image➪Image Size.
 
 The Image Size dialog box opens, 
as shown in Figure 1-3. This is 
where the magic happens.
 
2. Note the current state of your 
image and decide whether any 
of the following values need to 
change in order to get a nice-
looking image for the desired 
output (print or the Web):
 
• The current pixel dimen-
sions and the resulting file 
size: My example shows 
1536 pixels in width and 1024 
pixels in height for a file size 
of 4.5MB (megabytes).
 
• The current document size: The size of your image when it prints on 
media, such as paper.
 
• The resolution: My example is 72 ppi, which is good for displaying 
on-screen or on the Web, but inadequate for printing. I’ll see some 
pixelation (visible little squares) on my printout. Therefore, to print, 
I need to reduce the size of the image so that my total pixels are 
packed into a smaller area, to give the image cleaner lines.
 
3. Make sure the Constrain Proportions check box is selected.
 
 The chain-and-bracket icon in the Document Size area indicates that the 
Constrain Proportions check box is selected. Nine times out of ten, you 
want your image to stay proportional. With the option selected, chang-
ing one value in the Document Size area makes the other values change 
automatically so that the proportions stay intact.
 
 You can also select the Scale Styles check box, which allows you to scale 
or not scale any effects or styles that you’ve applied to your layer(s). 
This option is available only if you check Constrain Proportions. (For 
more on styles, see Book V, Chapter 4.)
 
4. Make sure that the Resample Image check box is deselected.
 
 When you resample, you add or delete pixels in the image. Although 
you sometimes need to resample, doing so isn’t good for your image (I 
explain why in the following section).
Figure 1-3: The Image Size dialog box is one of 
the most important in Photoshop.

129
Book II
Chapter 1
Specifying Size 
and Resolution
Resampling Images
 
5. Enter any new values in the dialog box.
 
 For example, because I want to print my image, I enter a new value of 
300 pixels per inch for my resolution in the Document Size area. The 
other values automatically change.
 
6. Click OK.
 
 You won’t notice any difference in the way your image appears on-
screen because you haven’t added or deleted any pixels; you’ve merely 
compacted them into a smaller space.
 
 Congratulations! You’ve just safely resized your image. You can proudly 
say, “No pixels were harmed in the making of this image.”
Resampling Images
Resampling means you’re changing the pixel dimensions of an image. When 
you downsample (or resample down), you’re eliminating pixels and therefore 
deleting information and detail from your image. When you unsample (or 
resample up), you’re adding pixels. Photoshop adds these pixels by using 
interpolation. Interpolation means Photoshop analyzes the colors of the 
original pixels and “manufactures” new ones, which are then added to the 
existing ones.
You can specify the interpolation method in the Image Size dialog box. The 
default that appears in the dialog box is based on the interpolation method you 
specified in your General Preferences dialog box. Here are your five choices:
 
✓ Nearest Neighbor: This method is fast and provides for the smallest file 
size, but it’s less precise than the other options and therefore the lowest 
quality. 
 
✓ Bilinear: Considered a medium-quality method, it works by averaging the 
color of the pixel above, below, and to the right and left of each pixel.
 
✓ Bicubic: This method is the slowest but most precise. 
 
✓ Bicubic Smoother: A good method to use when you must upsample 
images. Can slightly affect the sharpness of the image.
 
✓ Bicubic Sharper: This is a good method when downsampling an image.
 
If you really must resample, especially when upsampling, I recommend leav-
ing the method set to Bicubic Smoother. Notice I said if you really must. 
Here are some reasons why you might choose to add or delete pixels:
 
✓ You no longer have access to the original artwork, which you could 
otherwise rescan at the proper resolution and size.
 
✓ You no longer have access to the original high-resolution file.

130
Resampling Images
 
✓ You want to print a photo at a specific dimension, but the image’s cur-
rent resolution won’t allow for decent quality output.
 
✓ You absolutely can’t replace the low-resolution image with another of 
higher resolution.
 
Resampling isn’t a recommended activity, especially when it pertains to 
upsampling. As smart as Photoshop is, having to manufacture pixels isn’t an 
exact science. Your image tends to lose detail and sharpness and get blurry 
and mushy. Overall blurriness and goopy edges tend to be an unfortunate 
side effect of interpolation, as shown in Figure 1-4. The bottom line is that 
your resampled image never looks as good as the original. Downsampling 
isn’t as scary. You’re deleting pixels, and therefore detail, but the degrada-
tion is virtually undetectable to the eye.
A potpourri of image-size do’s and don’ts
Here are some tips and tricks to keep in mind 
when you’re messing around with image size 
and resolution settings:
 ✓ Use the Smart Sharpen or Unsharp Mask 
filter after you resample. Choose Filter➪
Sharpen➪Smart Sharpen or Unsharp Mask. 
These filters heighten the contrast between 
pixels to give the illusion of sharpening or 
forcing the image more into focus.
 ✓ Don’t change your settings — just print. 
If you want to leave the size and resolu-
tion settings untouched, but you need to 
print your image at a different size, use the 
Scaled Print size option in the Print dialog 
box. (For details, see Book I, Chapter 3.)
 ✓ Start out with the proper dimensions. It 
goes without saying, but I’ll say it anyway. 
Try to enter the proper dimensions and 
resolution when creating a new document. 
You don’t want to find yourself in the unfor-
tunate situation of creating your file at 72 
ppi, spending hours getting it just perfect, 
and then remembering you were supposed 
to prep it for print and really needed it to be 
300 ppi. Be sure you scan images at a high 
enough resolution, too.
 ✓ Don’t use a higher resolution than you 
need. All you do is create an unnecessarily 
huge file with a slower print time. In some 
cases, it may actually make your printout 
look darker and muddier.
 ✓ Look no further than this book. Use the 
handy, dandy table of recommended 
resolution settings for a variety of output 
devices in Book IX, Chapter 1.

Adding pixels to an image
To add pixels to an image, follow these steps:
 
1. With your desired image open, first choose Image➪Duplicate to 
make a copy of your original. With the duplicate active, choose 
Image➪Image Size.
 
 The Image Size dialog box appears.
 
 This is where the havoc happens. Be careful!
 
2. Make sure that the Resample Image option is selected.
 
 The Width and Height in the Pixel Dimensions area are now text boxes 
into which you can enter values. They’re no longer fixed values as they 
are when Resample Image is deselected.
 
3. Enter a higher value for the resolution and, if desired, enter a higher 
value for the width or height.
 
 In my example, I entered a resolution of 300 ppi.
 
 The pixel dimensions increased dramatically, and so did the file size 
(from a mere 148.5K to 2.52MB), as shown in Figure 1-5.

132
Resampling Images
 
 If you get all discombobulated 
when working in the dialog box, 
press Alt (Option on the Mac). 
The Cancel button changes to a 
Reset button. Click it, and you’re 
back to where you started. This 
is a good shortcut to remember 
because it holds true for many of 
Photoshop’s dialog boxes.
 
4. Leave your Interpolation 
method set to Bicubic (Best for 
Smooth Gradients), which is a 
good option when upsampling.
 
5. Click OK.
 
 Photoshop now goes through its 
interpolation ritual and churns 
out a newly resampled image. Do a side-by-side comparison to the origi-
nal, looking at both at 100% view. Your original should look a whole lot 
better than the resampled image. And, for a real shocker, try printing 
out the two images and seeing what kind of degradation takes place.
Taking pixels out of an image
When you downsample, you eliminate pixels and therefore delete information 
and detail from your image. Although I’ve emphasized the pitfalls of resam-
pling up, you can sometimes damage your image by downsampling, as well.
Granted, downsampling is sometimes necessary when you’re converting 
high-resolution print graphics into Web graphics. For example, you may be 
forced to take images used for a corporate brochure and repurpose them 
into content for the company’s Web site. You probably won’t notice much 
degradation in image quality because the images are just being viewed on-
screen. In addition, downsampling can occasionally camouflage the moiré 
patterns caused by scanning halftones (for more on halftones, check out 
Book VII, Chapter 1). Keep in mind, however, that 72 ppi isn’t sufficient for 
printing an image, as shown in Figure 1-6.
 
You should never need to make an image smaller than 72 ppi.
To remove pixels from an image, follow the steps in the preceding section 
and change the image settings accordingly.
 
If you have to downsample your image significantly — for example, to 25 per-
cent of its original size — you get better results if you do several successive 
50-percent downsamples, applying an Unsharp Mask or Smart Sharpen filter 
on the image in between each image sizing. (For more on the Unsharp Mask 
filter, see Book VII, Chapter 1.)

Changing the Canvas Size
I’ve probably harped on you to the point that you’re slightly paranoid, or at 
least ultra-conscious, of using the Image Size command. Well, you can relax 
because the Canvas Size command is as safe as can be. Unlike the Image Size 
command, which enlarges or reduces the dimensions or resolution of your 
image, the Canvas Size command merely changes the size of the canvas, or 
page, on which the image sits.
When you increase the size of the canvas, Photoshop fills the expanded area 
outside the image with your chosen color. Increasing your canvas size can 
come in handy if you’re trying to add a frame or border around your image. 
If you make the canvas smaller, Photoshop crops (cuts away) the image.
Follow these quick-and-easy steps to change your canvas size:
 
1. Choose Image➪Canvas Size.

134
Changing the Canvas Size
 
 The Canvas Size dialog box, shown in Figure 1-7, appears. The current 
size of your canvas appears at the top of the dialog box.
Purestock
Figure 1-7: Increasing your canvas size adds to the area around your image.
 
2. Enter new values in the Width and Height text boxes.
 
 You can also change the unit of measurement by using the pop-up menus.
 
 Select the Relative check box to be able to specify an amount of space 
for Photoshop to add or remove around your image. This feature is 
handy when you’re adding or removing equal amounts of canvas around 
images with fractional measurements.
 
3. Specify your desired anchor placement.
 
 The anchor shows how the image sits inside the canvas. By default, 
Photoshop centers the image and adds or removes the canvas around it. 
Click any of the other eight squares to have Photoshop add or remove 
the canvas asymmetrically around the image.
 
 If you reduce either the Width or Height value and then click OK, an alert 
box appears asking if you really want to proceed because you’ll be clipping 
the image. This is actually another way of cropping an image, albeit not one 
you’ll use everyday. See the following section for more on cropping.
 
4. Select your canvas color from the Canvas Extension Color pop-up 
menu and click OK.
 
 Choose from Foreground, Background, White, Black, Gray, or Other. If 
you select Other, Photoshop transports you to the Color Picker, where 
you can select any color you desire. The small swatch to the right of the 
pop-up menu displays the current background color. You can also click 
this swatch to access the Color Picker (which I explain how to use in 
Book II, Chapter 3).

Cropping an Image
Cropping an Image
Even a novice photographer knows that cropping an image can make a com-
position stronger. Cropping entails cutting away background clutter or end-
less expanses of empty space in order to focus in on your desired subject.
This simple process can transform 
a ho-hum photograph into a visu-
ally exciting one. Take a look at my 
example in Figure 1-8. I mean, it doesn’t 
take an Ansel Adams to figure out 
which image is stronger. (It would be 
even better if the fence weren’t in the 
background; but hey, that’s nothing 
that a little Photoshop retouching can’t 
take care of. Check out Book VIII; it’s 
all about retouching and restoration 
techniques.)
Using the Crop tool
 
 The most popular way to crop an image is by using the Crop tool. This 
simple tool is as easy and effective to use as a T-square and an X-ACTO knife, 
just without the possibility of bodily injury. Select the Crop tool in the Tools 
panel or press C on the keyboard. Then, follow these steps:
 
1. With the Crop tool, drag around the part of the image you want to 
keep and then release your mouse button.
 
 While you drag, a marquee (a 
dotted outline) appears and dis-
plays the cropping boundaries. 
Don’t worry if your cropping mar-
quee isn’t exactly correct. You can 
adjust it in Step 2.
 
 The area outside the cropping 
marquee appears darker than the 
area inside in order to better frame 
your image. Adobe calls this a 
shield. You control the color and 
opacity (the amount of transpar-
ency) of the shield by adjusting 
the settings on the Options bar. If, 
for some strange reason, you don’t 
want the shield, deselect the Shield 
check box. Figure 1-9 shows a great 
example of way too much back-
ground clutter. I dragged around 
the only thing I want to retain — the birthday girl.
Figure 1-8: Cropping is one of the easiest 
ways to improve the composition of your 
image.

marquee appears darker so that you can

Cropping an Image
 
2. Adjust the cropping marquee by dragging the handles.
 
 The small squares on the sides and corners of the cropping marquee are 
called handles. When you hover your mouse over any handle or the mar-
quee itself, your cursor changes to a double-headed arrow, indicating 
that you can drag.
 
 To move the entire marquee, position your mouse inside the marquee 
until you see a black arrowhead cursor and then drag. Adjust the mar-
quee until you’re satisfied.
 
 You can also drag the origin point (the circle icon in the center) to 
change the axis of rotation.
 
 If you move your mouse outside the mar-
quee, the cursor changes to a curved, double-
headed arrow. Dragging with this cursor 
rotates the marquee. This feature can be 
extremely useful when you need to rotate 
and crop a crooked image. By using the Crop 
tool, you can perform both commands in 
one step and often more quickly and accu-
rately. Just be aware that rotation, unless 
it’s in 90-degree increments, resamples your 
image — which, if done repeatedly, can 
damage your image (see the earlier section, 
“Resampling Images,” for more on resam-
pling). Getting the rotation right the first time 
around is for the best.
 
3. Double-click inside the cropping marquee.
 
 You can also just press Enter (Return on 
the Mac) or click the Commit (check mark 
icon) button on the Options bar. Photoshop 
discards the area outside the marquee, as 
shown in Figure 1-10. If you want to cancel 
the crop, just press Esc or click Cancel (the 
slashed circle icon) on the Options bar.
Cropping with the Marquee tool
 
 If you get bored with using the Crop tool, you can also crop a selected area 
by choosing Image➪Crop. Simply make a selection with any of the tools and 
then choose this command. Although using the Rectangular Marquee tool 
for your selection makes the most sense, you don’t have to.
You can use Image➪Crop with any selection — circular, polygonal, kidney 
bean, even feathered. Photoshop can’t crop to those odd shapes, but it gets 
as close to the outline as it can. (For all you need to know on selections, see 
Book III, Chapter 1.)

background clutter allows you

Using the Trim command
The fabulous Trim command trims away transparent or solid-colored areas 
around your image. Choose Image➪Trim, and a dialog box appears. Select 
Transparent Pixels (for layered images), Top Left Pixel Color, or Bottom 
Right Pixel Color as a basis for the trim. Then, choose to trim away the Top, 
Bottom, Left, or Right side(s) from the image and click OK.
 
This command works great for quickly eliminating black-and-white borders 
around images.
Using the Crop and Straighten Photo Command
Choose File➪Automate➪Crop and Straighten Photos. Photoshop then looks 
for rectangular areas in your document, extracts each one into its own docu-
ment, and straightens those individual images, as shown in Figure 1-11.
 
The Crop and Straighten Photos command is fabulous if you want to save 
time by scanning multiple images initially into one document (and the com-
mand works on single images, as well). This command is a real manual-labor 
time-saver, and I wholeheartedly endorse it.

separate files.

Sure-fire cropping tips
Even though cropping is about as simple an 
image-editing maneuver as you can get, you 
need to know about a few other options:
 ✓ Perspective: If you need a nonrectangular 
cropping marquee, select this check box on 
the Options bar (your crop marquee must 
be active). This feature allows the corner 
handles to move independently. Note that 
when you apply the actual crop, the photo 
is transformed into a rectangular shape, 
thereby distorting the image based on your 
applied perspective.
 ✓ Front Image: Also in the Options bar, this set-
ting enables you to crop one image so that it’s 
the exact same size as another image. Open 
two images and crop the first one. Click Front 
Image. Photoshop enters the width, height, 
and resolution values from the first image on 
the Options bar. Drag the Crop tool on your 
second image and adjust the marquee, as 
desired. Double-click inside the marquee. 
Photoshop automatically crops your second 
image to match your first.
 ✓ Delete and Hide: If your image doesn’t con-
tain any layers — that is, it consists only 
of a background — any cropped areas 
are permanently deleted from your file. 
However, if your image consists of one or 
more layers (see Book V for the lowdown 
on layers), you have the choice of deleting 
or hiding your cropped area. Delete elimi-
nates the cropped area, whereas Hide just 
hides the cropped area. You can see the 
hidden areas if you move the layer by using 
the Move tool. Another way to see the 
hidden area is to choose Image➪Reveal 
All. Photoshop expands the canvas to 
show all areas in all layers, except for the 
Background layer.
 ✓ Width, Height, and Resolution: If you want 
to crop an image to an exact measurement, 
enter a value in these text boxes on the 
Options bar. These options are available 
only when the Crop tool is active and you 
haven’t yet dragged a cropping marquee. 
But be careful about the value you use 
for the Resolution setting. Remember, re-
sampling isn’t a good thing. To remove the 
entered settings, click the Clear button on 
the Options bar.

Chapter 2: Choosing Color Modes 
and File Formats
In This Chapter
✓ Choosing the right color mode
✓ Switching a file’s color mode
✓ Focusing on file formats
I
n addition to choosing a size and resolution (discussed in Book II, 
Chapter 1), you need to decide on a color mode and file format for your 
image. This decision is usually based on the final use for the image. Are you 
importing it into a page-layout program for offset printing? Posting it on a 
Web page? Using it for a newspaper article?
When you know an image’s final destination, you 
can make intelligent choices about which color 
mode and file format are best. This chapter gives 
you some background information to help you make 
those choices so that you don’t end up having to do 
extra work, spend extra time, or waste extra money.
Selecting a Color Mode
Every file has a color mode, also called an image 
mode or just plain mode. To determine the color 
mode of an image, look in the title bar of the 
image window or choose Image➪Mode. Color 
modes define the color values used to display the 
image. Photoshop offers eight different modes and 
enables you to convert images from one mode to 
another. The color mode you choose for a particu-
lar image depends on a couple of factors:
 
✓ The file format you plan to save it in: Some modes call for specific file 
formats. You may find that a certain format is unavailable because your 
file isn’t in the appropriate color mode.

140
Selecting a Color Mode
 
✓ The end use for the image: Do you plan to post the image on the Web? 
Or are you putting it in a brochure that will be offset printed? For more 
on prepping images for print, see Book IX, Chapter 1. For details on get-
ting images ready for the Web, see Bonus Chapter 1.
The following sections provide a brief description and example of each 
mode and any file-format or usage connections.
 
Color modes affect the number of colors that are displayed, as well as the 
size of the file and the number of channels. One or more channels — in 
which the color data is stored — represent each mode. Grayscale images 
have one color channel — Black. CMYK images have four color channels — 
Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black. (For the lowdown on channels, see Book 
VI, Chapter 1.)
RGB Color
Uses: RGB is the gold standard for most scanners, all monitors, all digital 
cameras, and some desktop inkjet printers. And it’s the primary color mode 
(with Indexed Color being secondary) to use with any images to be viewed 
on-screen (whether on the Web or in any kind of multimedia presentation).
File formats: Just about every file format, except GIF, can handle an image in 
RGB mode.
Basic RGB and CMYK color theory
When you view an RGB image, you’re looking at 
an image made up of three colors — red, green, 
and blue. These colors are
 ✓ The primary colors of light
 ✓ The colors that correspond to the three 
types of cones inside your eyes
 ✓ The colors that comprise white light from 
the sun
 ✓ The colors your monitor uses when display-
ing images
The CMYK color scheme is based on the light-
absorbing quality of ink on paper. In theory, a 
white light hits these inks. Some visible wave-
lengths are absorbed, or subtracted, and others 
are reflected back to your eyes. CMYK images 
comprise various percentages of only four 
colors of ink — cyan, magenta, yellow, and 
black. These colors correspond to the inks used 
in the offset printing process.

141
Book II
Chapter 2
Choosing Color 
Modes and 
File Formats
Selecting a Color Mode
RGB is a very good overall work mode. Images in RGB mode have full access 
to all Photoshop commands, including filters and image adjustments. RGB 
images contain values of 0 to 255 for each of three colors — red, green, and 
blue. With 8 bits of color information for each of the three colors, these 24-bit 
images can reproduce up to 16.7 million colors on-screen. And 48-bit images 
(16 bits per color) can display even more. Most scanners also scan images in 
RGB, all monitors display in RGB, and some desktop inkjet printers prefer to 
print RGB (rather than CMYK) images.
 
The RGB mode in Photoshop varies according to the RGB Working Space set-
ting you select in the Color Settings dialog box. For details on color settings, 
see Book II, Chapter 3.
RGB also supports High Dynamic Range, or HDR, (32-bit per color) images.
CMYK Color
Uses: CMYK is the standard for images that are color-separated for offset 
printing. Many other composite printing devices also require images to be in 
CMYK mode.
File formats: CMYK can handle just about every major format except GIF.
CMYK images, such as the one shown 
in Figure 2-1, contain a percentage of 
one or more four-process color inks —
cyan, magenta, yellow, and black. 
Darker colors have higher percentages, 
whereas lighter colors have lower per-
centages. Pure white is created when 
all four colors have a value of 0 per-
cent. Like RGB mode, the CMYK mode 
in Photoshop can vary according to 
the CMYK Working Space setting you 
select in the Color Settings dialog box.
Make sure that you do all your image 
editing in RGB mode, where you have 
access to the full range of filters. When 
you complete your editing, convert the 
image from RGB to CMYK. (For details, 
see the section “Converting from RGB 
to CMYK,” later in this chapter.)

(and all shades of gray in between) 
images.
File formats: All the most commonly 
used file formats accept Grayscale 
mode.
Grayscale images contain up to 256 
levels of gray. Each pixel has a bright-
ness value ranging from 0 (black) to 
255 (white). You can scan an image in 
Grayscale mode, or you can convert 
color images to grayscale. If you convert 
a color image to grayscale, Photoshop 
discards all the color information, and 
the remaining gray levels represent the 
luminosity of the pixels. (Check out the 
“Converting to grayscale” section, later 
in this chapter.) You can also convert a 
grayscale image to a color image; although this process doesn’t actually con-
vert your grayscale image to color, it enables you to apply color on top of the 
grayscale image.
High Dynamic Range (HDR) images can also support Grayscale mode. For 
more on HDR images, see Book IX Chapter 2.
Monotone, Duotone, Tritone, and Quadtone
Uses: Because printing presses can print only about 50 gray levels per ink 
color, duotones and multitones — which use two to four inks — are used to 
increase the range of tones of grayscale images. Duotones and multitones 
are often created by using black and spot colors (premixed inks), although 
you can also use process colors. (For more on spot colors, see Book IX, 
Chapter 1.)
File formats: The only file formats that can save duotones, tritones, and 
quadtones are native Photoshop, Photoshop 2.0, EPS, PDF, Large Document 
Format, or Photoshop Raw.

Choosing Color 
Modes and 
File Formats
Selecting a Color Mode
These modes create one-color, (mono-
tone), two-color (duotone), three-color 
(tritone; shown in Figure 2-3), and four-
color (quadtone) images. Photoshop 
lumps all the various tone modes 
under duotone. You can find a pop-up 
menu in the Duotone options dialog 
box from which you can select the 
various options. Unlike RGB and CMYK 
images, in which the components of 
the image display with different colors, 
the monotones, duotones, tritones, 
and quadtones have the colors mixed 
throughout the image. The colored 
inks are used to reproduce tinted 
grays, not the different colors you find 
in RGB and CMYK images.
To access the Duotone mode, you must 
first convert the color image to gray-
scale by choosing Image➪Mode➪
Grayscale. Then, choose Image➪
Mode➪Duotone. In the dialog box that appears, select Monotone, Duotone, 
Tritone, or Quadtone from the pop-up menu. Then, select ink colors — 
either spot or process — by clicking the appropriate swatches. Finally, 
you can adjust the curves settings by dragging the graph line. This tells 
Photoshop how to distribute the ink(s) among the various tones. You don’t 
have access to the individual color channels in Duotone mode. The only 
manipulation you can do in that mode is to specify the curve settings.
 
If you’re new to these modes, you need to know that Photoshop offers 
numerous preset duotones, tritones, and quadtones. To access these pre-
sets, select one from the Preset pop-up menu. Sometimes, printing these 
types of images can be challenging, so starting with these presets is a good 
idea if you’re inexperienced.
Indexed Color
Uses: Indexed Color mode is primarily for Web graphics and multimedia 
displays.
File formats: Indexed Color mode supports a variety of formats, with GIF 
being the most popular. Other formats supported include Photoshop, 
Photoshop 2.0, Photoshop Raw, BMP, EPS, IFF Format, ElectricImage, Large 
Document Format, PCX, PDF, PICT, PICT Resource, PNG, Targa, and TIFF.

Figure 2-3: Tritone images use three inks 
that are mixed throughout the image.

144
Selecting a Color Mode
Indexed Color mode, shown in Figure 
2-4, uses 256 colors or less; what graph-
ics aficionados call 8-bit color. When 
you convert an image to indexed color, 
Photoshop builds a Color Lookup Table 
(CLUT), which stores and indexes the 
color. (The Color Table option appears 
in the Mode menu.) If a color in the orig-
inal image isn’t in the table, Photoshop 
chooses the closest match or makes 
a new one from the available colors. 
Using fewer colors reduces the file size, 
which is why the GIF file format — a 
very popular Web-graphics format — 
uses this mode. (See the “GIF” section, 
later in this chapter.)
 
The Indexed Color mode doesn’t sup-
port layers, and editing capabilities 
are limited. For more on indexed color, 
see Bonus Chapter 1 on this book’s 
Web site. (The Introduction has details 
about the companion Web site.)
Lab Color
Uses: Lab Color mode provides a consistent color display, which is ideal for 
high-end image retouching.
File formats: You can save an image in Lab Color mode in native Photoshop, 
Photoshop Raw, EPS, TIFF, PDF, JPEG 2000, Large Document Format, or 
Photoshop DCS 1.0 and 2.0 formats. You can save images containing 48 bits (16 
bits per channel) in Photoshop, Photoshop Raw, PDF, Large Document Format, 
and TIFF formats.
Lab Color mode is usually thought of as the internal color mode that 
Photoshop uses when converting from one color mode to another — for 
example, when going from RGB to CMYK. It’s also the mode preferred by 
color-retouching experts because it’s considered to be device-independent (it 
appears consistent on various devices).
Lab Color mode consists of a lightness channel and two additional channels 
(a and b), shown in Figure 2-5, which contain the range of colors from green 
to red (a) and blue to yellow (b).

Choosing Color 
Modes and 
File Formats
Selecting a Color Mode
HDR images containing 32 bits per 
color can be saved in Photoshop, 
FXG, Large Document Format, 
OpenEXR, Radiance, Portable Bit 
Map, and TIFF file formats. OpenEXR 
and Radiance are two types of HDR 
file formats. See more on HDR images 
in Book IX, Chapter 2.
Bitmap
Uses: This mode is best for scanned 
line art (that is, art composed 
entirely of lines, such as a line draw-
ing of a camera you might see in a 
manual) and signatures (your John 
Hancock).
 
When scanning line art, be sure to crank up your scanning resolution to 1200 
ppi or so to ensure a good-quality bitmap image.
File formats: Photoshop, Photoshop 2.0, EPS, TIFF, PDF, BMP, PNG, GIF, 
Large Document Format, PCX, PICT, PICT Resource, Portable Bit Map, and 
Wireless Bitmap.
Bitmap images contain pixels that 
are either black or white, exclusively. 
You must convert color images to 
grayscale before you can access 
Bitmap mode. When you choose 
Image➪Mode➪Bitmap, a dialog box 
appears, offering options for resolution 
and method. The various methods give 
different appearances, one of which is 
shown in Figure 2-6, so try each one to 
see which you prefer. When you select 
Custom Pattern, you can then select a 
pattern from the drop-down menu.
If you save a file in Bitmap mode as 
an EPS (see the section “EPS,” later 
in this chapter), you can convert the 
white areas in the image to transparent 
areas. Transparency enables you to 
overlay the file over a background con-
taining color or an image, and only the 
dark pixels show.
Figure 2-5: Lab Color mode is the preferred 
editing mode for color experts because it’s 
device-independent.

choose a method such as Pattern Dither.

Converting to a Different Color Mode
Multichannel
Uses: Multichannel mode is for special 
printing needs or as an intermediate 
mode when converting between differ-
ent color modes.
File formats: The only file formats 
available for multichannel images are 
native Photoshop, Photoshop 2.0, 
Photoshop DCS 2.0, Large Document 
Format, or Photoshop Raw formats.
The Multichannel mode, shown in 
Figure 2-7, comprises multiple gray-
scale channels, each containing 256 
levels of gray. Whenever you delete or 
mix channels, you end up with a mul-
tichannel image. You can also convert 
any image with more than one channel 
to this mode. In a multichannel image, 
each channel becomes a spot channel, 
with 256 levels of gray.
For more on channels, see Book VI, Chapter 1.
Converting to a Different Color Mode
Sometimes, your image starts out in one color mode, and then you find you 
need to convert the image to another mode. Maybe you have to strip the color 
out of an image you’re submitting to the local newspaper. Or maybe you have 
to convert your RGB image to CMYK to get it ready for an offset print job.
 
When you convert modes, you’re permanently changing the color values in 
your image, so save a backup image, just in case.
 
The following sections offer pointers for the most common conversions 
you’ll make. If you want to convert an image into an indexed color for the 
Web, your best bet is to use the Save for Web option, which I cover in Bonus 
Chapter 1 on this book’s companion Web site (you can find out about the 
Web site in the Introduction).
Converting from RGB to CMYK
As I mention several times in this book, CMYK is the image mode necessary 
for high-end composite printing and offset printing. You first want to perform 
all your necessary image-editing tasks in RGB mode for the following reasons:

creates a multichannel image.

Book II
Chapter 2
Choosing Color 
Modes and 
File Formats
Converting to a Different Color Mode
 
✓ The image size is smaller because RGB mode has only three channels.
 
✓ The RGB color space provides more device independence because it 
isn’t reliant on inks.
 
✓ You have full accessibility to filters and image adjustments.
 
✓ RGB mode provides a large color gamut, so Photoshop preserves more 
colors after it makes image adjustments.
 
When you finish editing the image in RGB mode, you can convert the image 
from RGB to CMYK (you can perform any fine-tuning in CMYK mode, if nec-
essary). If you’re new to this procedure, you may be surprised at what can 
result. Because the color gamut (range of colors) of the RGB model (16.7 mil-
lion) is much larger than that of CMYK (approximately 55,000), you may see 
a color shift, which may range from slight to major.
The extent of the shift depends on the colors in the RGB image and how 
many of them are out of gamut. Photoshop replaces RGB colors that are out 
of gamut with the closest match available within the CMYK gamut, often 
replacing the electric blues, fiery reds, and sunny yellows with duller, mud-
dier CMYK equivalents. Unfortunately, you can’t do anything to prevent 
this replacement. It’s just the way of the world of color. However, if you can 
select colors (instead of acquiring them from a scan), be sure that you don’t 
select any colors that are out of gamut to begin with. You can also soft proof 
colors (preview the effects of your CMYK conversion without actually con-
verting) by choosing View➪Proof Setup➪Working CMYK. Check out Book II, 
Chapter 3 for details about selecting colors and soft proofing.
Converting to grayscale
You can convert a color image to grayscale in a multitude of ways, as shown in 
Figure 2-8. The following sections cover a few that you may want to try out.
Quick-and-dirty method
Choose Image➪Mode➪Grayscale. Photoshop then asks you whether you 
want to discard color information. Click Discard. If your image contains mul-
tiple layers, Photoshop first asks whether you want to merge your layers. If 
you want to keep your layers, click the Don’t Merge button.
Although this method does the job in stripping color from your image, you 
may be left with an image that’s flat and lacking contrast. You can apply a 
Levels adjustment (choose Image➪Adjustments➪Levels) to boost the con-
trast, or you can try one of the other conversion methods.
Be aware that you can no longer apply color to your image after you convert 
it. If you choose a color in the Color pan3l, the color appears gray in the 
foreground and background color icons. If you want to apply color to your 
grayscale image, convert it back to RGB or CMYK mode.

Figure 2-8: Photoshop gives you many ways to convert a color image to grayscale.
Lab Color mode method
This method most likely provides a better grayscale image than the quick-
and-dirty method we describe in the preceding section. Make sure that you 
finish all your edits that require layers before you follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Image➪Mode➪Lab Color.
 
 As I mention in the section “Lab Color,” earlier in this chapter, convert-
ing to Lab Color mode converts the channels into a lightness channel 
and a and b channels containing ranges of color. If you have layers, 
you’ll be prompted for whether you want to merge your layers. You can 
choose either option because, in Step 2, you have to flatten the image 
if you want to proceed with the operation. For details on working with 
layers, see Book V.
 
2. Choose Window➪Channels. Delete the a channel by dragging it to the 
trash icon at the bottom of the panel.
 
 Again, if you have layers, click OK to flatten your layers. If you select 
Cancel, you abort the operation.
 
 If you delete the a channel, the b channel then changes its name to 
Alpha 2.
 
3. Delete the Alpha 2 channel.

 That leaves you with the lightness channel, which is now named Alpha 1.
 
4. Choose Image➪Mode➪Grayscale.
 
 Your color image is now a grayscale one.
Best channel method
If you look at the individual channels in the image, one often stands out 
as being a very good grayscale image by itself. (If channels are a mystery 
to you, check out Book VI, Chapter 1 for details.) You may find that the 
Red channel provides a good grayscale image when the subject is people 
because humans have a lot of red in their skin. Or you may find that the 
Green channel looks good in a scenic shot. The Blue channel rarely yields 
a nice image, though. Most of the crud picked up in a digital image finds its 
way into the Blue channel.
In the Channels panel, select each channel and view its contents. 
Find the channel that looks the best, select it, and then choose 
Image➪Mode➪Grayscale. If you have layers, Photoshop asks whether you 
want to flatten your layers. Click OK. Photoshop then asks whether you want 
to discard all the other channels. Click OK.
 
You can also use the Channel Mixer to create custom grayscale images. For 
more on the Channel Mixer, see Book VI, Chapter 1.
 
Finally, you have yet one more way to convert to grayscale, via the Black & 
White feature in the Image➪Adjustments submenu. For details, see Book VIII, 
Chapter 1.
Using the Conditional Mode Change command
Photoshop enables you to specify instances in which one mode changes 
into another so that you can utilize the conversion command in an action. 
Briefly, an action is a collection of recorded and saved commands that you 
can replay again and again. (For details on actions, see Book II, Chapter 5.) 
Sometimes, when you incorporate a mode conversion as part of an action, 
you get an error message because the file you’re opening may not have the 
same mode you specified as the source mode in the action. For example, 
you may have specified CMYK as your source mode in the action. But if the 
action opens a file in Grayscale mode, you get an error message because 
the Grayscale mode of the file doesn’t match the CMYK source mode. The 
Conditional Mode Change command takes care of this problem. Follow these 
steps to add this command to your action:
 
1. Start creating and recording your action.

150
Choosing the Right File Format
 
2. Choose File➪Automate➪
Conditional Mode Change.
 
 The Conditional Mode Change 
dialog box, shown in Figure 2-9, 
appears.
 
3. Select the mode(s) you want as 
valid for the source mode.
 
 Other options include the All or 
None buttons to select (respec-
tively) all modes or no modes.
 
4. Select your desired target mode 
from the Mode pop-up menu.
 
5. Click OK.
 
 If all goes well, Photoshop incorpo-
rates the Conditional Mode Change command as a step in your action.
Choosing the Right File Format
A critical component in saving a file is choosing the file format. The file 
format is the way the file’s data is represented and saved. Photoshop gen-
erously offers numerous file formats to choose from. Some you’ll use fre-
quently, and others you’ll probably never set eyes on. I provide quite a bit of 
detail on the formats you’ll use most frequently in the following sections.
 
If a file format doesn’t appear in the Open, the Save, or another dialog box, 
you may need to install the optional plug-in for that particular format.
TIFF
TIFF, Tagged Image File Format, is by far one of the best and most useful 
formats. One of the great qualities of TIFFs is that they are and have always 
been totally cross-platform. In addition, almost every program on the planet 
can import TIFFs. Okay, so that’s a slight exaggeration. Almost every word 
processing, presentation, page-layout, drawing, painting, and image-editing 
program can import TIFFs. This file format works especially well for printed 
or color-separated images.
Photoshop enables you to save layers and transparency (explained in 
detail in Book V) and also use various methods of compression. You have 
the option of having Photoshop warn you that including layers increases 
your file size. To enable this option, select the Ask Before Saving Layered 
TIFF Files check box in the File Handling section of the Preferences 
dialog box (Edit➪Preferences➪File Handling on a Windows computer or 
Figure 2-9: Include the Conditional Mode 
Change command in your action to ensure 
all images are processed, regardless of the 
image’s mode.

Photoshop➪Preferences➪File Handling 
on the Mac). Photoshop saves the 
layers, along with a flattened version of 
the image. Be aware that some applica-
tions may display only the flattened 
version (in which case, transparency 
isn’t preserved).
It should come as no surprise that the 
most commonly used format offers a 
variety of options — all of which are 
available in the TIFF Options dialog box 
(shown in Figure 2-10). The following 
sections give you everything you need 
to know about your various options so 
that you can make an informed deci-
sion, based on your intended uses for 
the image.
Image Compression
 
Compression makes your file sizes 
smaller, but at a cost. If your files are 
unusually large, compressing them 
makes them save and open more 
slowly. TIFF files can be up to 4GB in size. Be careful, however, because older 
versions of Photoshop and other applications don’t support file sizes larger 
than 2GB.
Photoshop offers three methods of compression, besides the option of 
None, which (of course) leaves your image uncompressed:
 
✓ LZW: This method has been around for eons and is a lossless compres-
sion scheme, which means that data isn’t deleted to make your file 
smaller. LZW is especially good for compressing images with large areas 
of a single color. Most programs that support TIFF also support LZW 
compression, so you can use this method without much hesitation.
 
✓ Zip: Zip compression is also a lossless method and is popular in the 
Windows arena. Like LZW, it works well with images that have large 
areas of a single color.
 
✓ JPEG: This method, although popular and very effective, is a lossy com-
pression process. When compressing, JPEG deletes data to reduce the 
file size. (That’s where the loss in lossy comes from.) JPEG compression 
is a cumulative compression scheme, which means that it recompresses 
every time it saves. Over time, this can degrade image quality.
Figure 2-10: The TIFF options dialog box 
offers a multitude of options for saving 
TIFFs.

152
Choosing the Right File Format
 
 I recommend that you stick with LZW compression, if possible. If you 
need to create a JPEG, however, minimize the degradation of lossy com-
pression by leaving your image in either TIFF or native Photoshop file 
formats while editing. Then, when you’re completely done editing and 
you need to compress the image, save the file as a JPEG at a high-to-
maximum-quality setting.
Pixel Order
Specify how Photoshop arranges the data in the color channels of the TIFF 
file. Interleaved stores the samples from individual channels interleaved 
with each other (for example, RGBRGBRGB). Per Channel stores them con-
secutively (for example, RRRGGGBBB). Previously, Photoshop wrote all 
TIFFs as Interleaved. But Per Channel offers better compression and speed, 
and Adobe swears that all applications support the format.
Byte Order
Byte order is the way bits of data are arranged and stored. Specify whether 
you want to save the TIFF for a Mac or a PC. If you want to be able to use the 
image on both platforms, select IBM PC. Macs are much more forgiving when 
exchanging files.
Save Image Pyramid
This option enables you to save multiple resolutions of an image. The top of 
the pyramid is the lowest resolution, and the bottom of the pyramid is the 
highest resolution. If the program supports them, you can choose to open 
any of the resolutions. Photoshop can open the image only at the highest 
resolution within the file. I recommend leaving this option deselected.
Save Transparency
Select this option to preserve transparent areas when the TIFF is opened in 
other applications. Of course, those applications must also support trans-
parency. If you open a TIFF with transparency in Photoshop, the transpar-
ent areas are always preserved, whether or not you select the option. This 
option is disabled if your image has no transparent areas.
Layer Compression
If your file has layers and you choose to save them, you have the choice of 
RLE (Run Length Encoding) or Zip compression. Because RLE compression 
is also lossless, you have the choice of faster saves (RLE) or smaller files 
(Zip). The last choice is for Photoshop to discard the layers, thereby flatten-
ing the image, and then save it as a copy. Your original layered file remains 
intact. This option is disabled if your image has no layers.

JPEG
JPEG, the acronym for Joint Photographic Experts Group, is a file format that 
uses lossy compression (explained in the “Image Compression” section, ear-
lier in this chapter). The JPEG file format offers 13 compression settings — 
the higher the quality, the less the compression, and vice versa.
JPEG compression is very effective. It can squeeze your file size to practically 
nothing. But because the compression is lossy, I don’t recommend this format 
for high-end printing. JPEG supports RGB, CMYK, and Grayscale image modes.
 
If you want to post your image on the Web, you have to save it as a JPEG, 
GIF, or PNG. JPEG works great with photographic images that have a wide 
range of colors. You’re better off using the Save for Web feature when saving 
as a JPEG. You think 13 levels of compression is a lot? With Save for Web, 
you get around 100 levels of compression, along with some other options. 
Check out Bonus Chapter 1, on this book’s companion Web site, for the low-
down on all the JPEG options and settings. (The Introduction offers details 
about the book’s companion Web site.)
 
The .fxg file format is a new vector graphics file format. It’s an XML format 
used to describe graphic files and intended to be used for new Flash author-
ing applications.
JPEG 2000
JPEG 2000 is a cousin to standard JPEG; it provides a few more bells and 
whistles, including better compression rates and more quality settings. In 
addition to the standard lossy compression algorithms, JPEG 2000 (shown in 
Figure 2-11) also offers lossless compression and can support 16-bit images, 
alpha and spot channels, and transparency (8-bit images only). You can save 
this format by using the following image modes: RGB, CMYK, Grayscale, and 
Lab Color. If you want to utilize this file format, be sure to install the optional 
plug-in; it’s on the Photoshop CS4 Install CD.
 
One of the coolest features of this format is its support of a Region of Interest 
(ROI). This feature enables you to selectively choose a region of an image 
that you can then optimize to ensure the best quality. You save an alpha 
channel (explained in Book VI) to define that vital portion of the image 
where detail retention is critical. You can then compress the rest of the 
image more heavily and with lesser quality, resulting in a smaller file size. 
For more details on JPEG 2000, see Bonus Chapter 1 on this book’s compan-
ion Web site (which I talk about in the Introduction).
 
Although praising the qualities of JPEG 2000 is all well and good, be warned 
that you currently need a plug-in to view these files on the Web, and support 
is still spotty. In the future, this format may become a standard for the Web 
and for digital cameras.

154
Choosing the Right File Format
Figure 2-11: The JPEG 2000 format is a souped-up version of an old favorite.
GIF
 
GIF is another file format used for Web graphics. GIFs support transparency — 
but on the down side, you must save GIFs in the Indexed Color mode, which 
offers only 256 colors (or even fewer). Although this format is great for making 
tiny files, it’s not so great for continuous-tone images in which the number of 
colors displayed is critical. Therefore, the GIF format is usually reserved for 
illustrations (spot illustrations, buttons, logos, and so on) and type with large 
areas of flat colors and sharp details. For the whole story on GIFs, head to this 
book’s companion Web site (discussed in the Introduction) and check out 
Bonus Chapter 1.
EPS
EPS is short for Encapsulated PostScript. PostScript is a page-description lan-
guage developed by Adobe and used by many printers. The EPS format can 
contain both vector and raster graphics. (For details on vector and raster 
graphics, see Book II, Chapter 1.) The EPS format tends to create larger 
file sizes and doesn’t have a built-in compression scheme, as do JPEGs or 
TIFFs. EPS is a recommended file format for creating color separations for 
high-end, four-color print jobs. This is also the file format to use for images 
with clipping paths (explained in Book III) and one of the few formats that 
supports Duotone mode. In addition to duotones, EPS supports Lab Color, 

155
Book II
Chapter 2
Choosing Color 
Modes and 
File Formats
Choosing the Right File Format
CMYK, RGB, Indexed Color, Grayscale, and Bitmap modes. Also, you use this 
format when creating a DCS (Desktop Color Separations) file. It doesn’t sup-
port alpha channels. Finally, EPS is the format of choice for importing to and 
from drawing programs, such as Illustrator, FreeHand, and CorelDraw.
Here are the options when saving 
in the EPS format, as shown in 
Figure 2-12:
 
✓ Preview: If you import your EPS 
into another application, this 
option provides a low-resolution 
image for you to view. I recom-
mend choosing 8-bit TIFF, which 
works on both PC and Mac.
 
✓ Encoding: This option specifies 
the way an image is sent to the 
PostScript printer. Choose 
Binary if you can; it produces 
smaller files and keeps all origi-
nal data. If you’re having printing 
problems, choose ASCII. JPEG compresses the file, but discards data and 
may cause color-separation problems. Avoid it, if possible.
 
✓ Include Halftone Screen and Include Transfer Function: Use these 
options for offset print jobs. Let your friendly service bureau or com-
mercial printing expert specify these options.
 
✓ Transparent Whites: If your image is in Bitmap color mode, this option 
enables white areas to appear transparent.
 
✓ PostScript Color Management: This option converts the file’s color data 
to the printer’s color space. I don’t recommend selecting this option if 
you’re importing your image into a document that’s color managed. (For 
more on color management, see Book II, Chapter 3.)
 
✓ Include Vector Data: When selected, this option preserves any vector 
graphics, such as type and shapes. However, that data is preserved only 
when you import the file into another program. If you reopen the EPS in 
Photoshop, your vector data is rasterized.
 
✓ Image Interpolation: This option anti-aliases low-resolution images — 
softens their edges when they’re printed.
PDF: The universal donor
PDF is the acronym for Portable Document Format, which is the native format 
of Adobe Acrobat. This format, developed by Adobe, can contain editable 
text, vector, and raster data. PDF files are often used for electronic documen-
tation that will be downloaded from the Web. 
Figure 2-12: When saving an EPS, specify your 
options.

156
Choosing the Right File Format
PDFs can be extremely useful in the imaging world. Anyone with a computer 
running Windows, Mac OS, or Unix can read a PDF. All you need to view a 
PDF file is Adobe Acrobat Reader, which is available as a free download from 
the Adobe Web site. If you save your image as a PDF and e-mail it to (or post 
it on the Web as a downloadable file for) a colleague, manager, client, or 
friend, that person can see your image — colors, fonts, and all — exactly the 
way you see it. The other nice thing about PDFs is that they have an auto-
matic compression process that makes the files small and manageable for 
mail transfer or loading on the Web.
When you save a file as a Photoshop PDF, you have all the same save options 
of the native Photoshop format. PDF supports layers, alpha channels, spot 
colors, and annotations, so select these options if you have any. It also sup-
ports the same image modes as the native Photoshop format. In addition, 
you can now also save 16-bit images as PDFs. After choosing your initial 
options, you get an alert dialog box that informs you that the settings you 
just chose may be overridden by the settings you choose next.
The Save Adobe PDF dialog box offers a multitude of options. At the top 
of the dialog box are settings for presets, standards, and compatibility, as 
shown in Figure 2-13:
 
✓ Adobe PDF Preset: Select a preset setting from the pop-up menu. 
Photoshop then kindly gives you a description of that setting and what 
versions of Acrobat can open that PDF. The default setting of High 
Quality Print creates PDF files suitable for good-quality printing on desk-
top printers. Stick with the default as an overall setting — unless you 
want to specifically create a PDF to view on-screen or e-mail for approval 
purposes, in which case, select Smallest File Size.
 
 PDF/X is an ISO (International Organization for Standardization) standard 
for graphic content exchange designed for the prepress workflow. Ask 
your service provider or offset print house if it prefers one of the PDF/X 
formats, rather than the generic PDF, for final file output. For specifics on 
the criteria of each of the PDF/X formats, check the Acrobat Help file.
 
✓ Standard: Accept the default associated with your chosen preset or 
choose a flavor of PDF/X from the pop-up menu. 
 
✓ Compatibility: Specify the version of Acrobat you want your file to be 
compatible with. Note, however, that Acrobat 4 and 5 don’t support 
layers. When you change either the Standard or Compatibility options, 
(Modified) is added to your preset name.
In addition to the options along the top, described in the preceding list, this 
massive, multi-tiered dialog box offers the following categories in which you 
can refine your choices, if you want:
 
✓ General: The General category of settings contains the PDF presets, edit-
ing options, Acrobat version compatibility choices, and viewing options.

Figure 2-13: The Save Adobe PDF dialog box offers a smorgasbord of options.
 
✓ Compression: The PDF format, by nature, includes excellent compres-
sion, but you can compress and downsample your image even further to 
reduce (or maybe to simply adjust) the size of the PDF file. You can find 
details about downsampling in Book II, Chapter 1.
 
 If optimum print quality is a concern, you’re better off not down-
sampling your image at all.
 
✓ Output: The Output area covers how to handle the color data in your 
file when you export to PDF. I recommend keeping the default settings of 
your presets, unless you’re really sure of what you’re doing. An under-
standing of color management, explained in Book II, Chapter 3, helps 
you interpret the options in this area.
 
✓ Security: If want to apply some restrictions on who can open your PDF 
and what they can then do with it, you’ve come to the right spot. You can 
assign a password for opening the file in either Acrobat or Photoshop, 
but if you forget the password, there’s no way to extract it from your file. 
Make sure you write it down somewhere! You can also choose whether 
you want your user to be able to print or change the document.
 
✓ Summary: This option gives you a total rundown of all your specified 
options and alerts you to anything it finds not so kosher.

Acrobat 4 users can’t open PDFs that have 128-bit RC4 encryption.
 
 
You can also combine multiple images into a single, multi-paged PDF docu-
ment or slide show. This is a great way to e-mail images to co-workers, 
family, and friends. But you have to do it within Adobe Bridge. Click the PDF 
button in the Output tab and specify your options.
Photoshop
Of course, I can’t forget the native Photoshop format (.psd). This format 
offers a lot of benefits. First of all, along with TIFF and PDF, Photoshop 
enables you to save layers in your image. The other formats flatten the 
layers into a single background. This format works well if you’re going to 
spend a considerable length of time working on your image. The Photoshop 
format also supports all image modes, is the fastest format for opening and 
saving, and offers all the various save options.
Like TIFF, the Photoshop format uses a lossless compression process, 
although it’s invisible to you. If you need to open a file in an older version of 
Photoshop, be sure to save it as a native Photoshop file. Finally, almost all 
drawing and layout programs now support the importing of Photoshop files.
 
If you have QuickTime installed on your Macintosh (and, to a lesser extent, 
your PC), it provides a PSD translator that allows you to open PSD files in 
any application, such as Microsoft Word, that has the QuickTime translators 
enabled.
Photoshop Raw
This format is designed to transfer images among applications and plat-
forms. The Photoshop Raw format can be useful if you want to transfer an 
image to or from a mainframe computer or other type of device that doesn’t 
support the standard graphic formats. Don’t confuse it with the Camera 
Raw format I describe in the following section. The Photoshop Raw format 
supports CMYK, RGB, LAB, Grayscale, and Multichannel images. The format 
allows for any pixel or file size, but it doesn’t support layers.
You may never have to save a file in the Photoshop Raw format. If you do, you 
can likely accept the defaults for FileType, Creator, and Header. Save Channels 
In and Byte Order are similar to pixel order and byte order discussed earlier in 
this chapter. 
Camera Raw
The Camera Raw file format is the format used by many digital cameras to 
capture and save image data and also the image’s metadata, as shown in 

159
Book II
Chapter 2
Choosing Color 
Modes and 
File Formats
Choosing the Right File Format
Figure 2-14. In fact, this format captures everything about an image. It’s 
the closest possible thing to a digital negative. Each camera has its own 
proprietary raw image format. Fortunately, Photoshop can support most 
camera models, especially higher-end cameras. If, by chance, your new 
camera isn’t yet supported, check www.adobe.com periodically for updates.
Camera Raw files utilize a lossless scheme to capture and save image data, 
similar to TIFFs (explained in the section “TIFF,” earlier in this chapter). This 
approach is advantageous because no data is lost through compression as it 
is with the JPEG format. Camera Raw files also have the advantage of being 
smaller than uncompressed TIFFs. Of all the digital camera file formats, only 
Camera Raw images contain the actual, unadulterated data captured by the 
digital camera’s sensor without any camera adjustments, filters, and other 
processing. Many hard-core photographers consider this file format to be 
the pure digital “negative,” so to speak. They prefer to analyze, manipulate, 
and adjust the image data themselves, instead of leaving those decisions 
to the mercy of the camera. This file format also prevents the loss of any 
image data that can sometimes occur when a file is converted from its native 
format to a more commonly used format, such as TIFF or PSD. But Camera 
Raw is able to save your files as DNG (Digital Negative), TIFF, PSD, or JPEG 
formats, if you desire.

Choosing the Right File Format
Figure 2-14: The Camera Raw format is as close to a digital negative as you can get.
Here’s just a brief sampling of some of the more recent capabilities of 
Camera Raw:
 
✓ Select multiple Camera Raw files, as well as JPEGs and TIFFs, in Adobe 
Bridge and then edit the settings in one fell swoop.
 
✓ Make Camera Raw adjustments in white balance, exposure, shadows, 
contrast, saturation, sharpness, and so on. Your settings are applied to 
all selected files.
 
✓ Save your Camera Raw files in Adobe Bridge or import them into 
Photoshop for further enhancements.
 
✓ Rate your files inside Camera Raw.
 
✓ Crop your Camera Raw images.
 
✓ The Fill Light feature is similar to the Shadow function in Photoshop’s 
Shadow/Highlight feature. Move the slider (0 to 100) to lighten dark 
areas while leaving light areas undisturbed.
 
✓ Camera Raw files are processed in their own thread, which means you can 
do double duty — editing some files while saving others simultaneously.
 
 ✓ Camera Raw 5.0 now offers what’s referred to as localized corrections — 
using an Adjustment Brush, you can “paint” areas by using varying brush 
sizes to correct very specific portions of your image. Similarly, you can use 
the Graduated Filter to apply more or less adjustment to your image in a 
gradual, gradient-like manner. This is Camera Raw’s digital answer to using 
a Neutral Density analog filter when capturing a shot. The Graduated Filter 
can come in handy, especially when adjusting landscape shots.
 
Adobe has added additional camera support in version CS4 — but if, by 
chance, the Camera Raw feature still doesn’t support your particular camera 
model, contact Adobe to see whether it will be supporting your model in 
the near future. If your camera doesn’t capture images in the Camera Raw 
format at all, don’t worry. You’re fine with TIFF or JPEG, especially because 
you can edit these two formats in the Camera Raw dialog box. However, if 
your camera is capable of saving images in Camera Raw format, check out its 
capabilities. Visit www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/cameraraw.

with Camera Raw.
PICT
PICT, for Macintosh Picture, is a format developed by Apple as its main 
format for Mac graphics. It’s based on the QuickDraw screen language. And, 
although many Mac programs support PICT, I don’t recommend using it for 

161
Book II
Chapter 2
Choosing Color 
Modes and 
File Formats
Choosing the Right File Format
any images that you plan to print. PICTs are notorious for being absurdly 
slow in the printing department. Today, PICT images are used primarily for 
graphics that are incorporated into slides, screen presentations (such as 
PowerPoint), multimedia projects, and digital video. PICT supports these 
image modes: RGB (that include a single alpha channel), Indexed Color, 
Grayscale, and Bitmap (that don’t include alpha channels).
Make sure that QuickTime is running if you want to save a file as a PICT. In the 
PICT File Options dialog box, you have options for resolution and compres-
sion. Resolution uses the default option; otherwise, you delete colors from 
your image and can’t access the compression settings. The compression 
settings for PICT are more limited than those for the regular JPEG format — 
and they cause even more image degradation than those used with JPEGs. To 
minimize the damage, always select the maximum quality setting.
BMP
BMP (Bitmap) is a standard Windows file format commonly used for saving 
images that you want to make part of your computer’s resources, such 
as the wallpaper that you see on your Windows desktop. BMP is also a 
format used by computer programmers. BMP supports RGB, Indexed Color, 
Grayscale, and Bitmap image modes.
Here are your options when saving a BMP file:
 
✓ File Format: Choose between Windows and OS/2.
 
✓ Depth: Although you can select a bit depth, I recommend leaving the 
default setting Photoshop has selected for you.
 
✓ Compress (RLE): The compression scheme used is lossless, which is 
great, but don’t select this option if you’re creating wallpaper. Windows 
won’t recognize it.
 
✓ Flip Row Order: This option enables Windows to recognize the file by 
reading the first row of pixels first and the last row last. It’s for program-
mers who are coding for Windows applications. Leave it deselected 
unless you’re one of them.
Don’t worry about the Advanced Modes option. It’s even more eggheady 
than the other options and strictly programming territory.
Large Document Format (PSB)
Work with humongous files? Then you’ll be pleased to know that the Large 
Document Format supports files of any size. Besides the Photoshop Raw 
and TIFF file formats, the Large Document Format is the only other format 
that can save files larger than 2GB. Even better, the coveted features, such 
as layers, layer effects, and filters, are all supported by this format. If you 

162
Choosing the Right File Format
want to work with large files, just make sure you have the Maximize PSD and 
PSB File Compatibility option set to Always in the File Handling panel of your 
Preferences.
 
You knew it was too good to be true, right? Just remember that Large 
Document Format files can be opened in Photoshop CS or later, only. So, 
make sure any recipients of your files have the latest and greatest version 
of Photoshop. This limitation isn’t confined to older versions of Photoshop, 
either. Be forewarned that many other applications, and even some operating 
systems, fall to their knees when presented with a file size larger than 2GB.

C
olor in Photoshop takes on two personalities. On one hand, choosing 
colors and applying them is easy, fun, and stress-free. On the other 
hand, managing color — that is, making what you see on-screen 
match what comes out on paper (or in your browser) — can 
be difficult and frustrating.
Unfortunately, you have to be well-versed in both 
picking great colors and managing colors for print. 
What’s the use of creating the next Mona Lisa in 
Photoshop only to find that it looks like a fifth-
generation color Xerox copy? In this chapter, I 
start by showing you how to define and apply 
color; then, I ease you into the world of color 
management.
If you haven’t already read the section on color 
theory in Book II, Chapter 2, you might want to give 
it a gander before you dive into this chapter. Knowing 
a little color theory may make this chapter a little more-
palatable.
Dealing with Foreground and Background Colors
Photoshop has two categories of color — a foreground color and a back-
ground color. You apply the foreground color when you use the type tools, 
the painting tools, or the shape tools. The foreground color is also the 
beginning color of a default gradient applied by the Gradient tool. The 
background color is the color you apply with the Eraser tool (assuming you 

Defining Color
164
don’t have layers) and is the ending color of the default gradient. When 
you increase the size of your canvas, you fill the additional canvas with the 
background color (also assuming you don’t have layers). You can find the 
swatches that represent the two color categories in the lower part of the 
Tools panel, as shown in Figure 3-1.
 
The default color for the foreground is black; the background is white. Click 
the small icon labeled in Figure 3-1 or simply press the D key to return the 
colors to the defaults. To switch the foreground and background colors, 
click the curved arrow in the Toolbox or press the X key.
Here are a few tips to help you get a handle on using tools with foreground 
and background colors:
 
✓ Blend the foreground and background by using the Gradient tool. 
When you drag with the Gradient tool across the canvas and the gradi-
ent is set to the default, you get a blending of the fore-
ground and background colors.
 
✓ Fill selected areas with the foreground color. Just click 
your canvas with the Paint Bucket tool to select areas 
based on a Tolerance setting and fill those areas with the 
foreground color.
 
✓ Apply the background color by erasing. If you’re working 
on a background, rather than a layer, you can use the Eraser 
tool to apply the background color. Some people prefer to 
say you’re erasing to the background or canvas color.
 
 If you use the Eraser tool on a layer, you erase to 
transparency. See Book V for the scoop on layers.
 
✓ Add more background to your canvas and fill it with 
the background color. When you enlarge your canvas 
size, Photoshop, by default, automatically fills the added 
canvas with the background color.
 
 If you enlarge a layer, the extra canvas is transparent. 
See Book II, Chapter 1 if the word canvas seems foreign 
to you.
Defining Color
Like with nearly everything else in Photoshop, you can select color in 
several ways. In the following sections I explain each of these color-
definition options:
 
✓ Click a color in the Color Picker.
 
✓ Move the sliders in the Color panel.

✓ Sample color from your image (or elsewhere) with the Eyedropper tool.
 
✓ Grab a color from the Swatches panel.
Poking around Color Picker
When you click either the Foreground or Background color swatch in the 
Tools panel, you’re transported magically to the Color Picker. This huge 
dialog box, shown in Figure 3-2, allows you to select a color from the color 
spectrum (called a color slider) or to define your color numerically.
 
Choosing a color visu-
ally is fine for Web or 
multimedia work, but 
not recommended for 
print work. Among 
other reasons, your 
monitor uses an RGB 
(red, green, and blue) 
color model, whereas 
printers use a CMYK 
(cyan, magenta, 
yellow, and black) 
model. For more on 
this and other color-
management 
issues, see “Color 
Management 
Essentials,” later in 
this chapter. For the 
basics of color theory, 
see Book II, Chapter 2.
To select a color visually, follow these steps:
 
1. Click either the Foreground or Background color swatch in the Tools 
panel.
 
 The Color Picker dialog box appears (refer to Figure 3-2).
 
2. Drag the color slider to get in the ballpark of the color you want.
 
3. To fine-tune your choice, click in the large square on the left.
 
 This square area is called a color field. The circular icon targets your 
selected shade. The dialog box displays your new chosen color, as well 
as the current, or original, foreground or background color.
 
 The numeric values also change accordingly to represent the exact 
shade you’ve chosen.
Color field
Color slider Color values
Figure 3-2: Using the Color Picker is one of the many ways to 
specify color in Photoshop.

Defining Color
166
 
 Alternatively, if you know the numeric values of the color you want to 
use, you can plug in the values in the text boxes on the right side of the 
Color Picker. For example, RGB values are based on brightness levels, 
from 0 to 255, with 0 being black and 255 being the pure color or white. 
CMYK values are based on percentages (0 to 100) of the four process 
colors — cyan, magenta, yellow, and black. You can enter the hexadeci-
mal formula for Web colors.
 
4. When you’re satisfied with the color, click OK. Note that you can add 
your new color to your Swatches panel, if desired. Click the Add to 
Swatches button. Name your new swatch and click OK.
 
5. Click OK to exit the Color Picker.
 
You can do pretty much the same thing in the Color panel that you can do 
with the Color Picker. I prefer the Color panel, so I go into more detail about 
that approach in the following section.
Mixing with the Color panel
To open the Color panel, shown in Figure 3-3, choose Window➪Color. A 
couple of swatches in this panel may look vaguely familiar. That’s because 
they represent the foreground and background 
colors — just like the swatches in the Tools 
panel. And (also like the Tools panel swatches) 
the infamous Color Picker appears if you click the 
swatches in the Color panel. But forget the Color 
Picker; you don’t need to go there. Everything 
you need is right here in this tiny panel.
Before you use the Color panel to define your 
colors, you should know which color model you 
want to use. Here’s a short description of each:
 
✓ Grayscale: For working strictly in black, white, and shades of gray. You 
get one slider, K, which represents black. Move the slider to get shades 
of gray, including complete white and complete black.
 
✓ RGB (Red-Green-Blue): For anything that’s viewed on-screen — from 
multimedia and slide presentations to content for the Web. You can use 
it for printing on most desktop inkjet printers.
 
✓ CMYK (Cyan-Magenta-Yellow-Black): Used in printing.
 
✓ Web Color: Used strictly for the Web. If you select this model, make 
sure that you also select Make Ramp Web Safe from the Color panel 
options menu. The Ramp is the color spectrum bar at the bottom of the 
Color panel.
 
✓ HSB (Hue-Saturation-Brightness): Based on percentages of saturation 
and brightness, and an angle (0 to 360 degrees), which corresponds to a 
location on the color wheel. I don’t cover this model in Book II, Chapter 2.
Figure 3-3: The Color panel is 
a compact but efficient way to 
select colors.

Defining Color

Book II

Using and 
Managing Color
 
✓ Lab (Lightness, a, b): Contains three channels: one for lightness, one (a) 
that contains colors from green to red, and one (b) that contains colors 
from blue to yellow. Lab is more complex to understand and work with 
than the other models — and it’s the color model of choice for high-end 
color experts. (By the way, Lab is also Photoshop’s native color mode.)
When you want to define a color according to a color model, I think the 
Color panel is the way to go. Follow these quick and easy steps to define a 
color by using the Color panel:
 
1. Open the Color panel by choosing Window➪Color.
 
2. Make sure the color swatch you want to define, Foreground or 
Background, is selected on the left side of the Color panel.
 
 An outline appears around the selected swatch.
 
3. Select your desired color model from the Color panel pop-up menu by 
clicking the down-pointing arrow in the upper-right corner.
 
 You’ll probably be using RGB, CMYK, or Web Color the majority of the time.
 
 If you want to use the RGB color model but also want to ensure that any 
color you choose is printable, select CMYK Spectrum from the Color 
panel options menu. By default, all the colors in the ramp are printable. 
Just be sure to choose your colors by clicking in the ramp.
 
4. In the Color panel, move the sliders for each component of the color 
model or enter numeric values.
 
 You can also select a color by clicking inside the color ramp at the 
bottom of the Color panel. Click the small swatches at the far-right end 
of the color ramp to change your color to black or white.
 
5. To make sure your desired color works with the color mode you’ve 
selected, keep an eye open for an alert icon.
 
 Here are a few more tips to keep in mind when working with the 
Color panel:
 
• If you’re working in RGB or CMYK, this alert icon is known as the 
gamut alarm and looks like the triangular warning sign. Its appear-
ance is Photoshop’s way of saying, “Hey, you! That color you mixed 
won’t print the way you think it will because it’s out of gamut.” 
Remember, gamut is the range of colors a device can either display 
or print.
 
• Because the RGB color model has a much wider gamut than the 
CMYK color model, some of the colors can be viewed only on-screen 
and not reproduced on paper.
 
• If a color is out of gamut, Photoshop offers you a substitution. Inside 
a little square to the right of the gamut alarm icon, the closest 
printable color to the one you chose appears.

Defining Color
168
 
• If you’re working in Web Colors, be on the lookout for a small cube 
icon. Click either the icon or the square to use the closest Web-safe 
color. The cube indicates that the color you mixed isn’t a Web-safe 
color. Clicking the cube tells Photoshop that you want to use its 
Web-safe alternative, instead. A Web-safe color ensures that the 
color won’t dither (mix available colors to simulate a missing color) 
when displayed in the browser.
 
6. Click either the icon or the square if you want to use the closest print-
able color, rather than your original choice.
Grabbing color from the Swatches panel
Another way to define a foreground or background color is by clicking a 
color in the Swatches panel, shown in Figure 3-4. Choose Window➪Swatches 
to bring up the panel.
You can have any tool active when you use the Swatches panel to define a 
color because as soon as you move the tool over 
the Swatches panel, it temporarily changes to an 
Eyedropper icon that samples the color.
 
Besides being a way to select your foreground 
and background colors, the Swatches panel acts 
like a traditional artist’s paint palette in digital 
form by letting you store as many colors as you 
want in the panel for later use.
To change the background color, either select 
the background swatch icon in the Color panel or 
simply Ctrl-click (Ô-click on the Mac) a swatch in 
the Swatches panel.
Here are some of the things you can do with the Swatches panel:
 
✓ Customize the Swatches panel’s display. You can choose how to dis-
play the Swatches panel by selecting Small or Large Thumbnail (swatch 
thumbnails) or Small or Large List (swatch thumbnails along with a name) 
from the Swatches panel pop-up menu (click the down-pointing triangle in 
the upper-right of the panel to open the menu).
 
✓ Use preset colors. To load a particular preset swatch library, select 
it from the list on the Swatches panel pop-up menu. Click Append to 
add the library to the existing swatches or OK to replace the existing 
swatches. You can find libraries specific for Web graphics and for 
implementing spot colors, such as those created by Pantone, Toyo, and 
Focoltone. You can also select Load Swatches from the Swatches panel 
pop-up menu. In the Load dialog box, navigate to the Color Swatches 
Figure 3-4: The Swatches 
panel allows you to grab and 
store colors.

folder by following this path: Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CS4\
Presets\Color Swatches; then, select your desired library.
 
 You can also work with swatches by using the Preset Manager. (For 
more on the Preset Manager, see Book I, Chapter 5.)
 
✓ Customize your own Swatches panel. To add a color to the Swatches 
panel, do one of the following:
 
 
• Click the New Swatch icon at the bottom of the Swatches panel.
 
 
• Select New Swatch from the Swatches panel pop-up menu. Name 
your swatch and click OK.
 
• Click an empty spot in the Swatches panel (your cursor changes 
to a paint bucket icon). Name your swatch and click OK. Or Alt-
click (Option-click on the Mac) on an empty spot to add the color 
and bypass the Name dialog box. Note that the color that’s added 
depends on whether your foreground or background swatch is 
selected.
 
✓ Delete swatches that you don’t want anymore. To delete a swatch, drag 
it to the trash can icon at the bottom of the Swatches panel.
 
✓ Create your own library of swatches. To save a set of swatches as a 
library, select Save Swatches from the Swatches panel pop-up menu. 
Name your swatch library (leave the file extension as .aco) in the Save 
dialog box. Click Save. 
 
✓ Save swatches to share with other Adobe Creative Suite applications. 
Select Save Swatches for Exchange from the Swatches panel pop-up 
menu, and your color panel is saved in a format (with an .ase extension) 
that you can then load into sister applications, such as Illustrator and 
InDesign.
 
 I recommend saving libraries in a subfolder of the Presets folder. Follow 
this path: Adobe\Adobe Photoshop\Presets\Color Swatches; then, 
create your own folder, name the file, and click Save.
 
✓ Restore your default swatch libraries. To return to the default library of 
swatches, select Reset Swatches from the Swatches panel pop-up menu. 
You can choose to either replace or append to the current library.
Lifting and sampling color
 
 Photoshop lets you change foreground or background colors by lifting them 
from the image with the Eyedropper tool. Using the Eyedropper tool comes in 
handy when you want to sample an existing color in an image for use in another 
element. For example, if I want my text to be the same color as the flower in my 
image, I click a petal with my Eyedropper tool, which then lifts (samples) the 
color and makes it my new foreground color. I then create my type, which uses 
that foreground color. Voilà — color coordination at its finest.

Defining Color
170
Here are some handy tips for using the Eyedropper tool to suck up color 
from one place and use it elsewhere in your image:
 
✓ Select any color you want from any image that’s open. If you have 
multiple images open, you can click inside an image that you’re not 
working on. In fact, if that doesn’t knock your socks off, you can lift any 
color you see on-screen, even from a file in another application, such as 
Illustrator, or from your desktop. Just click and drag your Eyedropper 
from the image window onto the color you want to sample. Be sure that 
you can see both application windows simultaneously.
 
✓ Select your sampling area. You have only two options (found on the 
Options bar) to worry about when using the Eyedropper tool. You can 
select the color of just the single pixel you click (Point Sample). Or 
Photoshop averages the colors of the pixels in a 3-x-3-, 5-x-5-, 11-x-11-, 
31-x-31-, 51-x-51-, and 101-x-101-pixel radius. You can also choose to 
sample from just your currently active layer or all your layers.
 
✓ Make colors Web ready with a right-click of your mouse button. For 
you Webbies out there, if you right-click (Control-click on the Mac) your 
image to bring up the context menu, you have one more option — Copy 
Color as HTML. This option converts the sampled color to a hexadeci-
mal color code and copies the code to the Clipboard so that you can 
paste the code into an HTML file.
 
✓ Toggle between the Eyedropper and other tools. For your produc-
tive painting pleasure, when you’re using the Brush, Pencil, Color 
Replacement, Gradient, Paint Bucket, or Shape tool, holding down Alt 
(Option on the Mac) allows you to temporarily access the Eyedropper 
tool. Release the key to return to your original tool.
 
✓ Toggle between the background and the foreground. If the foreground 
color swatch is active, Alt-click (Option-click on the Mac) with the 
Eyedropper tool to lift a new background color. If the background color 
swatch is active, Alt-clicking (Option-clicking on the Mac) lifts a new 
foreground color.
To use the Eyedropper tool, you first need to decide whether you want to 
change the foreground or background color. Then, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the foreground (or the background) in the Tools panel or the 
Color panel.
 
2. Select the Eyedropper tool in the Tools panel (or press the I key).
 
 Fortunately, the Eyedropper looks exactly like a real eyedropper.
 
3. Click the color in your image that you want to use.
 
 That color becomes your new foreground (or background) color.

Using the Color Sampler tool to measure color
 
 The Eyedropper’s cousin, the Color Sampler tool, looks like an eyedropper with 
a small target next to the icon. It also shares the Eyedropper’s flyout menu.
The “Sampler” moniker is kind of misleading because this tool only measures 
the colors you click. In addition to merely obtaining the numeric value of a 
color, the Color Sampler tool can monitor changes to your image after you 
apply color-correction techniques and filters.
Follow these steps to use the Color Sampler tool:
 
1. Select the Color Sampler tool in the Tools panel and then click the 
color you want to measure.
 
 A target icon, labeled #1, appears on your image.
 
 Photoshop opens the Info panel automatically and shows you the 
numeric values for that color (as shown in Figure 3-5).

2. Repeat Step 1 up to three more times for a total of four targeted colors.
 
 Target icons appear for your second, third, and fourth samples.
 
3. With the Color Sampler tool, drag the targets to sample new areas 
of your image, if you want. Delete a target by Alt-clicking (Option-
clicking on the Mac) it.
 
 You can actually measure a fifth color by just moving the Color Sampler 
cursor around the image. The numeric value appears in the upper por-
tion of the Info panel.

Color Management Essentials
Grab some Tylenol. You’re about to delve into the rather confusing and 
sometimes cantankerous world (or as some users would call it — underworld) 
of color management. It’s, by far, the biggest headache of every graphics

professional’s day-to-day experience. And I’m sure quite a few home users 
also scratch their heads wondering why their digital photos looked so great 
on-screen and turned into a muddy mess on paper.
 
Reproducing color isn’t an exact science. In fact, sometimes you’d think it 
takes an act of voodoo magic to get the output you want. Don’t throw up 
your hands and live with whatever output comes out the other end; if you 
can’t change the color, you can at least change your attitude toward color. 
Getting a handle on color management requires four things — some knowl-
edge, some patience, a significant amount of time to experiment and test, 
and (most importantly) acceptance. Acceptance of the unfortunate fact that 
you don’t live in a WYSIWYG world: What you get in one medium is some-
times merely an approximation of what you see in another.
Why? Well, I start with the basic gripe of many users while they look disap-
provingly at their printout — “But it didn’t look like that on the screen!” As 
detailed in Book II, Chapter 2, you can work with two major color models — 
RGB (Red-Green-Blue) and CMYK (Cyan-Magenta-Yellow-Black). The RGB color 
model (16.7 million colors), which all monitors use, has a significantly wider 
range of color (called a gamut in computer lingo) than the CMYK color model 
(approximately 55,000 colors) that printers use. So, many of the colors you 
see on-screen fall outside the CMYK gamut — and therefore can’t be repro-
duced on paper. And, in some cases, some CMYK colors fall outside the RGB 
gamut. Programs such as Photoshop do their best by providing colors that 
are the closest match. But those out-of-gamut bright and vibrant colors are 
matched with duller, darker versions, at best.
And, if that difference alone isn’t enough to complicate matters, hardware 
devices that share the same color model can possess different gamuts 
within that color model. For example, the RGB color space of a monitor can 
differ from the RGB color space of a scanner. Not only that, but you can 
also have different color spaces within the same type of device. A 15-inch 
generic monitor doesn’t display color equal to a 24-inch Samsung or Apple 
monitor. Likewise, an Epson printer may not share the same color space as a 
Hewlett-Packard or Canon printer. So, when you take into account the differ-
ences that can occur among platforms, monitors, printers, browsers, scan-
ners, applications, paper and other substrates, or any of the almost infinite 
number of possible permutations, it makes you want to return to the days of 
quill and parchment. Techies often call this mind-numbingly large number 
of possible inconsistencies device-dependent color. In other words, the color 
is dependent upon the hardware device. And device-dependent color varies. 
That’s just the cold, harsh reality, and nothing’s changing that.
But Adobe, being the kind and benevolent software mega-giant that it is, 
has developed (first introduced in Version 5.0) a color-management system 
designed to be device-independent. The five-cent explanation of this system 
is that you first identify your working color spaces. Photoshop then tags 
your files with that color space by embedding a color profile (also known 

Color Management Essentials
175
Book II
Chapter 3
Using and 
Managing Color
as an ICC profile) with your files. The program analyzes any color space in 
which you either view or output a file and makes adjustments on the fly so 
that the color is viewed and printed reasonably accurately and consistently, 
in theory, independent of the device. Photoshop also reads the embedded 
color profile (or lack thereof) of any file you open and addresses how you 
want to deal with that profile if it doesn’t match your working color space.
In the following sections, I give you the 25-cent explanation — which I hope 
is enough to get you started in managing color. If color management is an 
extremely critical workflow issue for you, I recommend buying a book or two 
strictly devoted to nothing but managing color. It’s well worth the money. 
One of my personal favorites is Color Management for Digital Photographers 
For Dummies, by Ted Padova and Don Mason (Wiley).
Setting up your work environment
One aspect of color management that people often overlook is setting up 
a good working environment for digital image editing. You may wave your 
hand impatiently and say, “Yeah, yeah, I just want to get to the important 
stuff.” This is the important stuff.
 
Don’t worry. Setting up a good work environment won’t cost you much. Just 
do these things:
 
✓ Keep your computer desktop a neutral gray. Colors and patterns 
behind your images influence the way that you perceive those images. 
Creating a neutral, gray desktop is the closest you can get to mounting 
your work on gray, black, or white matte board (and not neon green or 
paisley), the way professional graphic designers and photographers do.
 
✓ Keep your lighting as consistent as possible. For example, avoid working 
on images in full, bright afternoon sun and then again under a single desk 
lamp late at night. Likewise, view on-screen images and your printed output 
under the same lighting.
 
✓ Keep the walls of your work environment as neutral as your monitor 
desktop. You don’t have to paint your office gray, but try to avoid a lot 
of colorful posters and artwork around and behind your monitor.
 
✓ Speaking of monitors, if you’re using an LCD (flat screen) monitor, be 
sure you’re sitting directly in front of it. Color shifts quite a bit on LCDs 
if you’re viewing it at even a slight angle. So, no slumping in your chair!
 
✓ Keep a swatch book (or two) handy, such as those from Pantone or 
Trumatch, to select your colors. Don’t make a decision based on what 
you see on-screen. These books give you a true representation of how on-
screen color looks when printed on paper. Just be sure to keep them out 
of the light and update them periodically when the colors start to fade.

Color Management Essentials
176
 
 Be prepared for a healthy monetary investment when you buy a swatch 
book. These little buggers can cost anywhere from $75 to $200. You can 
purchase swatch books from some larger art supply stores or order 
them online. You can purchase Pantone books from www.pantone.com. 
Do a Web search for others, such as Trumatch, Focoltone, and Toyo.
 
✓ Take some time to test your workflow (production methods) and your 
computer system. Scan images using multiple settings, print images 
using multiple settings, and view your images using different browsers 
on different monitors and different platforms.
Get to know the strengths, limitations, and quirks of every piece of your 
equipment. Experiment with Photoshop. I know, I know, you have a life. But 
trust me — it’s an investment with great returns.
Calibrating your monitor
Calibrating your monitor and creating an ICC profile of your monitor ensures 
that your monitor doesn’t display any red, green, or blue colorcasts (traces
 of color) and that it provides as neutral a gray screen as possible. Calibration
 is incredibly important if you want to standardize your image display — 
knowing that how you view your image today will be how you view your 
image tomorrow or next week.
If you really want to do a good calibration job, consider investing in a com-
bination hardware/software calibration package. These products used to be 
really pricey, but you can get a starter package for as little as $79. You can 
choose from several manufacturers, including datacolor (http://spyder.
datacolor.com) and x-rite (www.xrite.com).
If you’re a Vista user, you can check out the new Windows Color System 
(WCS). Go to http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/device/display/
color/WCS.mspx for detailed information. If you’re a Mac OS X user and on 
a super tight budget, you can use the Display Calibrator Assistant. Choose 
Apple➪System Preferences and click Displays in the Systems Preferences 
dialog box. Then click the Color tab and click the Calibrate button. Answer 
the questions in the Display Calibrator Assistant. (See Figure 3-8.)
The Display Calibrator Assistant attempts to remove any colorcasts and get 
as neutral a gray background as you can. They also create a profile of your 
monitor for Photoshop, Illustrator, and other programs so that those appli-
cations know how your monitor displays color.
 
When you calibrate your monitor, display an image for which you already 
know the color values. For example, use an image that you’ve worked with 
and for which you have a good print, and then use that image each and 
every time you calibrate. Your goal is to match the digital image on your

Managing Color
screen to the printed image. You should calibrate every so often because 
monitors can drift and degrade. Some experts say weekly is best; others are 
more liberal and say monthly is fine.
 
Not only is letting your monitor warm up a prerequisite before you calibrate, 
it’s also a good idea before you sit down to tackle any image adjustment work.
Figure 3-8: Mac users can use the Display Calibrator Assistant to calibrate their monitors.
Establishing Your Settings
After you calibrate your monitor (see the preceding section) and adequately 
arrange your work environment (described earlier in this chapter), you need 
to nail down the color settings and make sure they’re the right match for 
your intended output.
You establish these settings in the Color Settings dialog box, the rather 
intimidating dialog box shown in Figure 3-9. To open it, choose Edit➪Color 
Settings. In the Color Settings dialog box, you can choose from predefined 
settings established for specific types of output, or you can customize your 
own settings to fit your individual needs. The following sections offer more 
details about the settings you can choose in the Color Settings dialog box.
 
While you’re perusing the dialog box, hover your cursor over any item to 
make a great description of that item appear at the bottom of the dialog box.

Figure 3-9: The Color Settings dialog box is command central for establishing your color-
management system.
Handling Photoshop’s predefined settings
In the Color Settings dialog box, Photoshop allows you to take the easy route 
and select from a long list of predefined color settings based on your desired 
output. After you set up the predefined settings, Photoshop provides all the 
appropriate working color spaces and color-management policies you need 
to get good color results.
Being the smart program that it is, Photoshop won’t steer you down the 
wrong path with its predefined settings. The only way you can mess up the 
predefined settings is if your output doesn’t match the setting. For example, 
the Web Graphics Defaults setting isn’t appropriate for your high-end, four-
color print job because these two mediums use color in completely different 
ways (see Book II, Chapter 2 for details if you’re curious why this is so).
Be sure to click the More Options button in the Color Settings dialog box to 
access the full set of predefined color settings. Here’s a brief description of 
the main settings in the Settings drop-down list at the top:

You can always use a predefined setting as a starting point and adjust what-
ever individual settings you need to. If you do, your predefined setting name 
automatically changes to Custom.
Indicating your working spaces
If you select one of the predefined color settings from the Settings drop-
down list, Photoshop plugs in all the necessary remaining options in the 
dialog box. (If you select the Custom option, Photoshop leaves whatever 
settings were there previously because it knows you’re going to choose your 
own settings, anyway.)
When you select one of the predefined color settings, the first group of set-
tings that Photoshop plugs in contains your working spaces. Working spaces 
are the color profiles associated with the RGB, CMYK, Grayscale, and Spot 
color modes. If you select the Custom color setting, you need to choose your 
own working spaces.
 
Each of the four working spaces is equally important, so I advise you to 
read all the following sections — and read them in order — if you’re serious 
about color management.
RGB working spaces
Table 3-1 gives you a quick view of your RGB working space options.

What It Does
Recommendation
Monitor RGB
Sets the working space to 
your current monitor space 
(which it gets from the mon-
itor profile you established 
during calibration). Forces 
Photoshop to turn off color 
management.
I don’t recommend this 
setting unless you have a 
specific need to use it.
ColorSync RGB
Sets the working space to 
the profile specified in the 
Apple Color Sync control 
panel. The default setting 
for the ColorSync Workflow 
predefined setting.
For Macintosh only.

Working Space
What It Does
Recommendation
Adobe RGB (1998)
The default setting for all 
the Prepress predefined 
settings. It’s the best color 
profile to use for viewing 
24-bit (8-bit mode) images 
and for converting RGB files 
to CMYK. Provides a large 
gamut of RGB colors.
I recommend this option 
as a general setting for 
all print work and as an 
overall setting if you’re 
unsure what to choose.
Apple RGB
The default setting for the 
Emulate Photoshop 4 pre-
defined setting. Can also 
be used for older Mac OS 
scanners and monitors.
Unless you’re the proud 
owner of a 13-inch Apple 
monitor, I’d avoid it.
ColorMatch RGB
Use this working space 
only with Radius Pressview 
monitors.
I don’t think I need to 
give you a recommen-
dation on this one! You 
Radius Pressview users 
know who you are.
ProPhoto RGB 
(also called ROMM 
RGB)
Provides a large color 
gamut. Good for viewing 
48-bit (16-bit mode) images. 
May see banding in 24-bit 
(8-bit mode) images.
Good for output to dye 
sublimation and inkjet 
photo printers.
sRGB
The default setting for Web 
Graphics Defaults. This 
color profile represents 
a standard, Trinitron PC 
monitor — the monitor 
of choice for many of the 
world’s Web surfers. Can 
also be used with Windows 
scanners. Avoid it for print 
work because of its limited 
RGB color gamut.
If your goal is to ensure 
your Web graphics look 
relatively the same in 
Los Angeles as they do 
in Bangladesh, sRGB is a 
good profile to use.
 
If you click the More Options button in the Color Settings dialog box, you get 
even more RGB, as well as CMYK, Grayscale, and Spot settings. These set-
tings include profiles for monitors, printers, and various video formats. For 
the most part, you can stick with the main working spaces and be covered.
 
You can save and load any custom settings, including the individual RGB, 
CMYK, Grayscale, and Spot working spaces, as well as your entire group of 
color settings.

Establishing Your Settings
182
 
After you set RGB working spaces, don’t forget that you also have to configure 
the other three working spaces, as described in the following sections.
CMYK working spaces
CMYK working spaces are a little more involved than RGB options (listed in 
the preceding section). CMYK working spaces serve a threefold purpose:
 
✓ Photoshop converts your RGB file to the CMYK color space when you 
choose Image➪Mode➪CMYK.
 
✓ You view your RGB image in the CMYK color space when you choose 
View➪Proof Setup➪Working CMYK (see the section “Proofing Colors in 
the Final Output (Soft Proofing),” later in this chapter, for more on soft 
proofing colors).
 
✓ The CMYK color space determines how a CMYK file is displayed on an 
RGB monitor.
 
Europe (FOGRA), Japan, and the United States have specific color profiles 
for printing. Those CMYK options are divided between those for coated 
and uncoated paper, and sheet-fed or Web printing presses. The latter two 
have different percentages of ink coverage and paper stock. Macs also have 
a ColorSync Generic CMYK profile. I’d leave the setting at U.S. Web Coated 
(SWOP) v2 unless your commercial printer tells you otherwise.
Grayscale working spaces
Grayscale working spaces have to do with two parameters — viewing and 
dot gain of grayscale images (Image➪Mode➪Grayscale). You can select Gray 
Gamma 1.8 for a Macintosh monitor or Gray Gamma 2.2 for a PC monitor. 
You can also view an image according to how it will print, based on typical 
dot gain.
Dot gain is how much ink the paper absorbs, thereby increasing the size of 
every halftone dot. When continuous-tone images are digitized, they’re con-
verted into a series of dots known as a halftone.
If you’re preparing graphics for the Web, you may want to set your working 
space to Gray Gamma 2.2 — whether or not you’re using a Mac — because 
most of the Web surfers worldwide are PC users.
 
For print work, leave the setting at Dot Gain 20% unless your commercial 
printer tells you otherwise. You can enter any desired percentage in the 
Custom Dot Gain option.
Don’t forget — you still have to adjust another working space, which I cover 
in the following section.

Establishing Your Settings
183
Book II
Chapter 3
Using and 
Managing Color
Spot working spaces
Spot working spaces have to do with spot colors. Spot colors are premixed 
inks that are printed in addition to, or in lieu of, the four process colors — 
cyan, magenta, yellow, and black. Unless your commercial printer tells you 
otherwise, stick with a setting of Dot Gain 20%.
Working with your newly defined settings
After you define your color profiles in the Color Settings dialog box, you may 
want to get a handle on how these newly established settings affect how 
Photoshop works. Although the settings typically affect only how Photoshop 
works in the background, you nevertheless might want to be aware of the 
following key changes:
 
✓ By default, any new images you create use the color profile you 
selected in the Color Settings dialog box. Every file you create on your 
computer now uses the colors within the gamut of your color profiles 
(either RGB or CMYK, depending on your document color mode). Overall, 
this default setting should make managing color in Photoshop easier. For 
example, if you mostly work with multimedia or Web images and have 
specified your color settings accordingly, you don’t need to worry about 
whether each color will display accurately because you’ve set the defaults 
to reflect that color mode. But, if you want to prep an image for print, 
those defaults won’t work, and you need to change your individual work-
ing spaces to those that are print-oriented or to a preset, such as North 
American Prepress.
 
✓ The color settings you select are used to display any untagged images 
(images that don’t have an embedded color). An example of an untagged 
image is a Photoshop file created before Version 5 — that is, before 
Photoshop supported embedded color profiles.
 
✓ Your settings define how Photoshop converts your images from one 
working space to another. For example, say you choose North America 
Prepress 2 from the Settings drop-down list in the Color Settings dialog 
box. In this case, the default for CMYK is U.S. Web Coated (SWOP) v2, 
which is a specific CMYK setting for a Web printing press and coated 
paper, among other things. (This setting appears in the Working Spaces 
area of the Color Settings dialog box.) When you convert an RGB image 
to CMYK (Image➪Mode➪CMYK) prior to sending it off to the printer, 
Photoshop automatically tags the image with the U.S. Web Coated 
(SWOP) v2 color profile.
 
✓ When you save a file, make sure that you select the ICC Profile (Embed 
Color Profile on the Mac) option in the Save dialog box, if it’s available 
(see Figure 3-10). (Some file formats don’t support color profiles.) This 
selection ensures that Photoshop tags the file with the specified color 
profile and that its origins are always known.

Establishing Your Settings
184
Figure 3-10: Select the ICC (or Color) Profile check box when you save an image.
Setting color-management policies
After you establish working color spaces, the next step is to establish the 
default color-management policy for each color mode. In other words, you 
need to tell Photoshop how to interpret and manage the color profiles of 
files it opens.
Photoshop looks at the color profile of a file, compares it to your working 
spaces, and then employs the default policies you’ve established. If the file 
has the same color profile as yours, there isn’t an issue. You’re good to go.
But sometimes, this isn’t the case — like in these situations:
 
✓ The file you open has no profile. These can be older files, files that 
were created with color management turned off, or files created in other 
applications that don’t employ color management.
 
✓ The file you open has a color profile that doesn’t match your working 
space. Say that you have a Web designer friend, and his settings are 
based on the North America Web/Internet option. He gives you a file, 
and you open it in Photoshop on your computer. You do mostly print

work, so your settings are based 
on the North America Prepress 
2 option. Photoshop then dis-
plays an alert that says the file 
has an embedded color profile 
that doesn’t match your current 
RGB working space — his work-
ing space is sRGB and yours is 
Adobe RGB (1998). The alert then 
goes on to describe the default 
policy that’s invoked on the file, 
as shown in Figure 3-11.
 
If you’ve selected a predefined setting, the policies have already been estab-
lished for you, and those should work fine. I do recommend, however, that if 
you change the policies of any of the predefined settings, don’t choose Off as 
your option, unless you have a good reason. (Remember: Color management 
is a good thing.)
To set your color-management policies, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the Color Settings dialog box by choosing Edit➪Color Settings.
 
2. In the Color Management Policies area, select from the following three 
options for each color mode:
 
• Off: This option turns color management off for any new files you 
create, import, or open. However, if the opened or imported file’s 
color profile matches your current working space, the profile is 
preserved.
 
• Preserve Embedded Profiles: This option displays the files in 
their original embedded color space. No color conversion occurs. 
Untagged files remain untagged but use the current working space 
for display.
 
• Convert to Working RGB (or CMYK or Grayscale, depending 
on your image mode): This option converts any files with miss-
ing or mismatched embedded profiles to your working RGB space. 
Untagged files remain untagged but use the current working space 
for display.
 
3. Decide whether you want to check the Ask When Opening check box 
for Profile Mismatches.
 
 If you don’t select the Ask When Opening option for Profile Mismatches, 
Photoshop displays the Embedded Profile Mismatch alert message (see 
Figure 3-12), describing which default policy will occur. You can then select 
the Don’t Show Again check box, and from that point forward, Photoshop 
executes the policy without displaying an alert. For files with missing pro-
files, Photoshop simply invokes the default policy without an alert.
Figure 3-11: Photoshop alerts you when you 
open a file whose color profile doesn’t match 
yours.

 If you select the Ask When Opening 
option for Profile Mismatches 
check box, Photoshop not only 
displays an Embedded Profile 
Mismatch alert, but also provides 
you with options for handling the 
color of that file, thereby overrid-
ing the default policy, as shown in 
Figure 3-12.
 
 The options in the alert are similar 
to the default policies of the Color 
Settings dialog box. Here’s a brief 
explanation of each option in the 
alert:
 
• Use the Embedded Profile (Instead of the Working Space): 
Photoshop displays the file in its original embedded color space and 
doesn’t perform any color conversions.
 
• Convert Document’s Colors to the Working Space: Photoshop con-
verts the file from its embedded color space to your working color 
space.
 
• Discard the Embedded Profile (Don’t Color Manage): Photoshop 
doesn’t utilize any color management when opening files but dis-
plays the file in your working space.
 
 Be cautious about making any CMYK conversions. If you encounter a 
Profile Mismatch with a CMYK image, you probably want to preserve the 
image’s embedded profile unless you’re absolutely sure it should be con-
verted to another CMYK working space. But, if the image doesn’t have a 
profile, then, by all means, convert it to your CMYK working space.
 
4. Decide whether you want to check the Ask When Pasting box for 
Profile Mismatches.
 
 If you select the Ask When Pasting option for Profile Mismatches, 
Photoshop prompts you when you drag and drop layers or selections 
that have the same color mode (see Book II, Chapter 2 for more on 
modes) but different color profiles. In the Paste Profile Mismatch alert 
dialog box, you have two options:
 
• Convert (Preserve Color Appearance): Photoshop converts and 
matches the appearance of the color, rather than the RGB numerical 
values. For example, the RGB color of R 152, G 122, B 250 may be a dif-
ferent shade of purple in one RGB working space versus another. If you 
preserve the numerical values, the shades won’t match. If you preserve 
the appearance, Photoshop attempts to maintain the two shades.
 
• Don’t Convert (Preserve Color Number): Photoshop doesn’t convert 
the appearance of the color, but instead matches the RGB numerical 
values.
Figure 3-12: Checking the Ask When 
Opening option allows you to override your 
default color-management policy setting.

Book II
Chapter 3
Using and 
Managing Color
 
 If you don’t select the Ask When Pasting check box, Photoshop pastes 
the color appearance between RGB images and pastes the numerical 
values between CMYK images.
 
5. Decide whether you want to select the Ask When Opening check box 
for Missing Profiles.
 
 If you do select the check box, Photoshop displays a Missing Profile 
alert and also provides you with the following options, as shown in 
Figure 3-13:
 
• Leave As Is (Don’t Color Manage): This option leaves the image 
untagged and without a color profile, but displays the image in your 
working space.
 
• Assign Working RGB (or CMYK or Grayscale, 
depending on your image mode): your working space: Photoshop 
tags the image with your working space and displays it in that work-
ing space. If you change your working space, the image retains the 
old working space.
 
• Assign Profile: This option 
allows you to assign any 
color profile contained within 
the pop-up menu. You can 
use this option if you know 
where the untagged image 
originated. For example, if 
you scanned your image and 
your scanner doesn’t embed 
profiles, you can assign the 
scanner profile.
 
 Unless you have a specific 
reason not to, I recommend that 
you assign your working RGB space to those orphan files.
 
6. If you’re done working in the Color Settings dialog box, click OK to exit.
 
I recommend selecting the Ask When Opening and Ask When Pasting 
check boxes. With these boxes selected, you know when a profile mismatch 
occurs — and you have the choice of picking your course of action, which 
includes overriding the defaults you set in the policy settings. So, you can 
evaluate whether you want to preserve or convert on a file-by-file basis. For 
example, if you’re a print designer and a Web designer gives you a file, you 
get a profile mismatch alerting you that the file has the sRGB color space 
and that it doesn’t match your working space of Adobe RGB (1998). If you’re 
going to use the image as-is for Web content, you tell Photoshop to preserve 
the embedded profile and not to make any conversion. But if you want to 
repurpose the image (for, say, a logo), you have to instruct Photoshop to 
convert the file to your working RGB space. (Of course, ultimately, you have 
to also convert the image mode to CMYK for printing purposes.)
Figure 3-13: Photoshop alerts you when 
opening an image without a color profile and 
asks you how you want to proceed.

Getting Consistent Color among Adobe Applications

To find out the color profile of an image, select Document Profile from the 
pop-up menu at the bottom of the image window (which I describe in detail 
in Book I, Chapter 1). Also, if an image has a color profile that differs from 
your working space, an asterisk appears outside the parentheses in the title 
bar. An untagged image displays a pound sign.
By the way, when you select More Options in the Color Settings dialog box, 
you have a few additional options regarding color conversion engines and 
rendering intents, which are methods of color translation. I recommend 
putting your trust in Photoshop and leaving these options at their defaults 
unless you’re a bona fide color expert.
Getting Consistent Color among Adobe Applications
If you have a complete Adobe workflow (like I do), you may want to use the 
same color settings for all your Adobe applications. Illustrator, InDesign, and 
Acrobat share a similar Color Settings dialog box. They have a few minor dif-
ferences, but nothing major. If an element doesn’t exist in one application’s 
Color Settings dialog box, Adobe merely plugs in the default setting. You can 
choose the same predefined color setting from the Settings pop-up menu in 
each application, or you can use a shortcut.
With the advent of Adobe Bridge (explained in Book I, Chapter 4), getting 
consistent color across all your Creative Suite applications is merely a 
button click away. Just follow these steps:
 
1. Simply launch Bridge and choose Edit➪Creative Suite Color Settings.
 
 In the Suite Color Settings dialog box, shown in Figure 3-14, you can 
immediately tell whether the color settings across all your Creative Suite 
applications are synchronized. (Synchronized is Adobe’s cool name for 
the same.)
 
2. If they’re not and you want the settings to be the same, first click the 
Show Expanded List of Color Settings Files to ensure you have the full 
list of possibilities.
 
3. Then, just select your desired predefined color setting from the list 
and click the Apply button.
 
 Bridge then ensures that each Creative Suite application uses that color 
setting. You can also select a previously saved custom setting. If you 
want to see where your saved color settings files reside, just click the 
Show Saved Color Settings Files button.

Getting Consistent Color among Adobe Applications
189
Book II
Chapter 3
Using and 
Managing Color
You don’t have to synchronize your color settings. You may want to have 
different settings in InDesign, a page-layout program, than you have in 
Dreamweaver, a Web-page-creation application. In the Color Settings dialog 
box in each Creative Suite application, a message appears at the top to let 
you know whether your suite color settings are synchronized.
Figure 3-14: Getting consistent color among your Adobe Creative Suite applications is a matter of 
a few clicks in Adobe Bridge.
You can save your custom Color Settings in Photoshop by clicking the Save 
button in the Color Settings dialog box. To ensure that all your Adobe 
applications can access the settings file, save it to a default location:
 
✓ For Microsoft Windows, the default location is the Program Files/
Common Files/Adobe/Color/Settings folder.
 
✓ For Mac OS X users, the default folder is User/CurrentUser/
Library/ApplicationSupport/Adobe/Color/Settings.
You can also place saved custom color settings files that you’ve received 
from other people (for example, reps from your offset print house) in this 
location.

Proofing Colors in the Final Output (Soft Proofing)
190
Proofing Colors in the Final Output (Soft Proofing)
Photoshop allows you to preview on-screen how your image will look on a 
variety of output devices. First, choose View➪Proof Setup and select your 
desired setup. The Working options are based on the working spaces you 
specified in the Color Settings dialog box (described earlier in this chapter):
 
✓ Macintosh RGB and Windows RGB: Display your image as it’ll appear 
on a standard Macintosh or Windows monitor. This setting can come in 
handy when you want to get a general idea of how your Web graphic will 
look on another platform.
 
✓ Monitor RGB: Allows you to view the image by using your current moni-
tor’s color space. This setting essentially turns off your RGB working 
space and lets you see the image without any color management.
 
✓ Custom: Allows you to choose a specific device. For example, choosing 
U.S. Web Coated (SWOP) v2, from the Device to Simulate drop-down 
menu, lets you to see how your RGB images will look when they’re con-
verted to CMYK for printing. Or you can choose your desktop inkjet 
printer profile from the Device to Simulate drop-down menu to see how 
your images will look when printed to that device.
After you select your setup, choose View➪Proof Colors to view the image in 
your chosen working space. For the most reliable results, use a good-quality 
monitor and set up a good viewing environment (described earlier in this 
chapter). Also, keep in mind that although soft proofing is a good thing, it’s 
no substitute for a good-quality hard-copy proof. Some things — such as 
the type and quality of paper, certain inks, and so on — can’t be accurately 
simulated on-screen.
 
Photoshop now offers two new proof setup settings to view how images will 
appear to those who are color blind. Color Blindness Protanopia mimics 
red-green color blindness with less sensitivity to red light. Color Blindness 
Deuteranopia mimics red-green color blindness with less sensitivity to 
green light.

W
hen Thomas Wolfe said, “You can’t go home 
again,” he wasn’t talking about Photoshop. If 
you change your mind about something you do and 
want to return to your starting place (or any point 
in between), Photoshop is very forgiving. My 
favorite image editor offers many different ways 
to reverse actions, undo what you did, reapply 
effects you’ve cancelled, and generally change 
your mind as often as a new apartment owner 
deciding where to put the couch.
This chapter helps you master Photoshop’s pow-
erful time-traveling features, including the Undo 
command, the History panel, and tools such as the Art 
History Brush and the Eraser.
Undoing What’s Done with the Undo Command
Your first stop in your journey through time is the Undo/Redo command. 
This command simply reverses the last action you took or reapplies that 
action if you just undid it. For example, if you apply a brush stroke that you 
don’t like, use Undo to remove that stroke. Then, if you immediately change 
your mind, you can redo it by using the command again.

Reverting to What’s Saved
192
To undo your last action, choose Edit➪Undo or simply press Ctrl+Z (Ô+Z on 
the Mac).
 
Press the Undo/Redo shortcut keys rapidly to toggle an effect on and off if 
you want to compare the before and after effects quickly. When you decide 
which way to go, stop toggling. This procedure works best if you press 
Ctrl+Z (Ô+Z on the Mac) to apply both Undo and Redo.
The Undo/Redo command works for only a single command. If you do any-
thing else after you apply a command and then change your mind about 
that command, you have to resort to one of the other time-travel techniques 
described later in this chapter.
If you can’t undo or redo an action, Undo/Redo is grayed out in the menu, 
showing that it’s unavailable. However, you can often use the History panel 
to remove the action. See the section “Working with the Almighty History 
Panel,” later in this chapter, for details on how to use the History panel.
 
If you want to free the memory that the Undo command uses, choose 
Edit➪Purge➪Undo. If the item is grayed out, the buffer is already empty. You 
can’t undo this action, so do it only if Photoshop is acting sluggish.
Reverting to What’s Saved
Revert replaces your current file with the last saved file, effectively wiping out 
everything you’ve done since you last saved the file. You can revert to the last 
version of the file by choosing File➪Revert (or by pressing F12). Although you 
lose all the changes in your current file when the last saved version replaces it 
on-screen, the Revert command is stored on the History panel. You can find out 
how to remove a command from the History panel in the section “Introducing 
History panel options and tools,” later in this chapter.
Working with the Almighty History Panel
Undoing and redoing commands, explained in the preceding sections, are 
kid’s stuff compared to the power of the almighty History panel (choose 
Window➪History). Think of this tool as a recipe that lists the steps (how 
many appear depends on what you specify in your preferences, which I talk 
about in the following section) that you took to cook up your image in its 
present state. By using the History panel, you can browse through the recipe 
and return to any step in the list to begin work anew from that point.
Understanding states and snapshots
You can’t go too far in your use of the History panel without understanding 
two important concepts, as well as how the concepts are different:

Book II
Chapter 4
Time Travel—
Undoing in 
Photoshop
Working with the Almighty History Panel
193
 
✓ States: States is just another way of saying steps. At any given point in 
your image-editing activities, Photoshop saves your edits into states.
 
 By default, Photoshop remembers 20 states for an image. You can 
increase the number to as many as 1,000 in the Performance Preferences 
dialog box. Choose Edit➪Preferences➪Performance (or Photoshop➪
Preferences➪Performance in Mac OS X) and enter a new value (or move 
the slider) in the History States box.
 
 Boosting this number can eat up your available memory quite quickly. You 
may want to leave the states set to 20 and save snapshots of your image, 
as I describe in the section “Taking Snapshots,” later in this chapter. When 
you reach the limit of 20 steps, the oldest step (at the top of the list) is 
deleted to make room for the latest one at the bottom.
 
✓ Snapshots: You can save temporary copies of an image, each containing 
all its various states. For example, say you make six edits to an image 
before you take a snapshot. The snapshot shows the image, but it also 
contains a complete history of the six states. Make a few more changes 
and take another snapshot: The new snapshot contains the six states 
you made previously, as well as any new ones. See “Taking Snapshots,” 
later in this chapter, to find out how to use snapshots.
When you have these concepts down, you can get to the business of under-
standing how the individual tools in the History panel use states and snap-
shots to help you go back in time (and back to the future again) to undo, 
redo, and modify each miniscule edit you make to your images.
Introducing History panel options and tools
The History panel has several useful components you should know about, as 
shown in Figure 4-1:
 
✓ Snapshot thumbnail: This miniature image of the saved snapshot 
image gives you a copy of your document that has all the current states 
included. (For more on snapshots, see the section “Taking Snapshots,” 
later in this chapter.)
 
✓ Source state column: Click in this column to the left of a particular snap-
shot or state, and when you begin painting with the History Brush tool or 
erasing with the Erase to History option, Photoshop uses the snapshot 
or state that you select in this column as the source.
 
✓ History state: A particular step or edit in your document’s list of steps. 
An icon appears in this column showing what kind of action occurred in 
that state.
 
✓ Active state marker: This slider points to the currently active state. You 
can drag it up or down to change the current state.

Viewing an Image’s Various States
194
Figure 4-1: The indispensable History panel lets you undo up to 1,000 steps.
 
✓ Create new document from current state: Click this icon to create a 
duplicate copy of your image at the currently selected state. Your new 
document starts out with a nearly empty history list. The only state 
that’s present is Duplicate State.
 
✓ Create new snapshot: Click this icon to store an image of your 
document, preserving all the states listed.
 
✓ Delete current state: Click this icon to remove a selected state.
 
✓ Undone states: These grayed-out states are undone when you select an 
earlier state in the list.
 
✓ Open state: The original document that you first opened.
 
✓ Current history state: The active state that you’ve selected in the 
history list.
Viewing an Image’s Various States
You can move back to any state listed in the History panel, remove a state to 
cancel a step, or perform other time-travel stunts by using the History panel. 
The following sections outline some basic time-shifting techniques that you 
can use.
Going back to a particular state
To go back in time and resume editing at a particular point, just click the 
state to which you want to return. All subsequent states appear grayed out, 
or what Adobe calls undone. Then, begin editing your image as usual. As 
soon as you perform a new step, all the states that follow your re-entry point

vanish. It’s like applying the Undo command (Ctrl+Z on a PC, Ô+Z on the Mac) 
to a group of steps with one click.
 
If you intentionally (or accidentally) begin editing while a previous state is high-
lighted, and then you change your mind, immediately undo your action — press 
Ctrl+Z (Ô+Z on the Mac). The subsequent steps that were removed reappear.
Reviewing your image at different states
To review how your image looked at various previous states, just click the 
state that you want to take a look at. (You can also drag the active state 
marker up and down the list.) The document image immediately changes to 
reflect that earlier state. You can move back and forth between any two points 
in the history list, if you like. As long as you don’t make any editing changes 
during your time-traveling jaunt, your current history list is preserved.
Purging and clearing all states
To remove a state and all the steps that follow it, select the state and then 
press the Delete key or click the trash can icon.
You can clear all the states except the most recent one from the panel by 
selecting Clear History from the panel pop-up menu (click the down-pointing 
arrow in the right corner of the panel to make this menu appear). All your 
snapshots will be preserved. You can undo your clearing only if you choose 
Edit➪Undo immediately after you execute the command. You can also delete 
all the states except the last one in the history list and keep the snapshots 
you’ve saved by choosing Edit➪Purge➪Histories. You can clear or purge your 
history list when you no longer need the states it includes — either if you 
want to save memory or return to the original state of your document. When 
purging, just be sure that you’re really, seriously not interested in going back 
again later to make changes because you can’t undo this command.
Navigating the history list
You can move up and down the history list, even if the list isn’t visible on 
your screen. Choose Edit➪Step Forward to move forward in the history list 
and Edit➪Step Backward to move back. The best way to access these com-
mands is to use the keyboard shortcuts:
 
✓ Press Alt+Ctrl+Z (Option+Ô+Z on the Mac) to move backward in time 
(up the history list).
 
✓ Press Shift+Ctrl+Z (Shift+Ô+Z on the Mac) to move forward in time 
(down the history list).

Looking at the History Options Dialog Box
196
Looking at the History Options Dialog Box
The History panel has five options that 
change its behavior. To access these 
options, select History Options from 
the History panel pop-up menu, which 
opens the History Options dialog box, 
shown in Figure 4-2. For a rundown of 
the various settings, see Table 4-1.

create a snapshot of the 
image when you first open 
it, before you make any 
changes. You can return to 
this snapshot at any time 
by clicking its name in the 
History panel.
Checked. Consider it 
free insurance — you 
can always return to 
your original image, if 
necessary.
Automatically Create 
New Snapshot When 
Saving
This option, checked by 
default, tells Photoshop 
to create a new snapshot 
each time you save the 
image.
Depends. If you’re 
like me and save 
every couple of 
minutes, you prob-
ably don’t want to 
select this option; 
otherwise, you end 
up with a panel filled 
with unwanted 
snapshots.
Allow Non-Linear 
History
Selecting this option lets 
you edit or delete a state 
without removing all the 
states that follow it. When 
the Non-Linear History 
capability is active, you can 
edit an intermediate state 
in the history list, leaving 
the other steps below it 
unchanged.
Unchecked. Use this 
option with caution 
because steps are 
interdependent. A 
change that you 
remove may form the 
basis for another edit 
later on, so deleting 
it can cause weird 
results.

Taking Snapshots
Snapshots are duplicates of your image at a particular point in time, similar 
to saving a document with an alternate name to create a copy of that docu-
ment. (Photoshop automatically names the snapshots generically Snapshot 
1, Snapshot 2, and so on.) However, snapshots are temporary copies, avail-
able only during your current work session.
 
You can use snapshots to alternate between versions of an image when 
you’re making major changes. For example, if you plan to apply several fil-
ters and adjustments that will drastically modify your image, you may want 
to save a snapshot before you apply the filters and adjustments, and then 
save another snapshot after you apply them. You can then click either snap-
shot to switch from one version to the other quickly, as shown in Figure 4-3.
 
The second you close a file, the snapshots you’ve taken disappear forever. 
If you want a more permanent way of saving versions of your file, see the 
Layer Comps panel discussion in Book V, Chapter 2.
To take a snapshot, follow these steps:

1. Select the state at which you want to take a snapshot.
 
 You can select the most recent state that has all your latest editing 
changes, or you can select an earlier state. Just make sure that you take 
the snapshot before your desired state is eliminated.
 
2. Select New Snapshot from the panel pop-up menu.
 
 You can also click the New Snapshot icon at the bottom of the History 
panel. Either way, the New Snapshot dialog box opens. Photoshop 
names your first snapshot Snapshot 1.
 
3. In the Name box, enter a name for the snapshot.
 
 Use a name that helps you remember the contents of that particular 
snapshot.
 
 You can add or change the name of the snapshot later by double-clicking 
the snapshot name in the history list and typing the new name.
 
4. If you like, select a snapshot subtype in the From menu.
 
 Full Document, which is the default, creates a snapshot of all the layers 
in the image at the currently selected state. It’ll probably suit your

needs. You can also take a snapshot of merged layers or just the current 
layer. Book V explains working with layers.
 
5. Click OK to create the snapshot.
 
If you no longer need a snapshot, either select the snapshot and click the 
trash can icon, drag the snapshot to the trash can icon, or select Delete from 
the History panel’s options menu.
Restoring Part of an Image
Although the concept may seem like quantum physics, you can erase and 
brush on an image by using previously saved states or snapshots.
What? Okay, let me try this again. You can erase portions of an image to a 
history state, as well as paint on an image from a history state. So, traveling 
through time doesn’t have to be an all-or-nothing experience; you can erase 
or paint portions of a different state onto your currently active state.
For example, suppose you apply a blur filter to a face and decide later that 
you want to make the eyes sharp again. You can use the Eraser tool with 
the Erase to History option selected, or the History Brush tool, to paint over 
the eyes with information from an earlier state before you blurred them, as 
shown in Figure 4-4.

Using the Eraser with the Erase to History option
Use the Eraser with the Erase to History option when a portion of an earlier 
state or snapshot contains information that you want to include in an image 
that you’ve extensively edited. To erase and restore to a portion of an earlier 
state or snapshot, just follow these steps:
 
1. In the History panel, click in the far-left column of the state or snap-
shot that you want to use as the source for the Eraser tool with the 
Erase to History option.
 
 A Brush icon appears to the left of the state’s listing in the History panel, 
indicating that Photoshop will use this state as the source for the Eraser 
tool with the Erase to History option.
 
2. Select the Eraser tool.
 
 You can also press the E key to access the tool.
 
3. Select the Erase to History option on the Options bar.
 
4. Select any other Eraser tool options that you want to use, such 
as Brush size and type, Mode, Opacity and Flow percentages, or 
Airbrush.
 
 The Mode options include a Brush, Pencil, or Block tip for your brush.
 
5. Select your desired layer in the Layers panel and, in the History 
panel, select the state that you want to erase to.
 
6. Drag your eraser on the portion of the image you want to erase.
 
 Photoshop removes the image in the layer and replaces it with the 
image in the state that you specified as the source in Step 1.
 
You can convert the Eraser tool so that it temporarily uses the Erase to 
History option by holding down the Alt key (Option key on the Mac) while 
you erase or paint.
Using the History Brush tool
You can use the History Brush tool to apply an image area from a different 
state or snapshot to your current state. Use this tool to restore a portion 
of an image to an earlier state, while leaving the rest of the heavily modi-
fied image alone. The History Brush has an advantage over the Eraser tool 
because the History Brush gives you access to many different blend modes. 
Just follow these steps to use the History Brush:
 
1. In the History panel, click in the far-left column of the state or snap-
shot that you want to use as the source for the History Brush tool 
(refer to Figure 4-1).

 A Brush icon appears in the column, indicating that Photoshop will use 
this state as the source for the History Brush tool.
 
 In my example, I chose my original image just after I cropped it.
 
2. Select the History Brush tool in the Tools panel.
 
 You can also press Y to select the tool.
 
3. On the Options bar, select any other brush options that you want to 
use — such as Brush size and type, Mode, Opacity and Flow 
percentages, and Airbrush.
 
 For details on the brush options, see Book 
IV, Chapter 1.
 
4. Select your desired layer in the Layers 
panel and, in the History panel, select the 
state that you want to paint back to.
 
5. Drag with the History brush to paint over 
the portion of the image you want to 
restore.
 
 Photoshop paints over the image in the layer 
with the image from the state you specified 
as the source in Step 1.
 
 In Figure 4-5, I painted my original faces 
by using a 10–15% Opacity setting over my 
Water Paper-filtered image.
Using the Fill with History feature
If you can easily select the area that you want to replace with a specific 
state, you can use the Fill with History feature. Suppose you don’t like the 
sky in a particular image. You select the sky area and then add clouds by 
using the Clouds filter. After you make those changes, you want to put the 
original sky back, but you don’t want to reverse any of the other edits you 
performed in the meantime. Just follow these steps to replace an area by 
using the Fill with History feature:
 
1. Click in the far-left column of the state you want to use as the source 
for the Fill with History function in the History panel.
 
 For example, select the state that has the original sky.
 
2. With your current state active, use your favorite selection tools to 
select the area that you want to replace.
 
 For example, if you remembered to save your original sky selection 
before you added clouds, you can choose Select➪Load Selection and 
retrieve that selection. Book III covers selection tools in detail.

3. Choose Edit➪Fill and then select History from the Use pop-up menu.
 
4. Click OK to fill the selection with the image area from the selected 
state.
Using the Art History Brush tool
The Art History Brush tool is an interesting variation on the plain old History 
Brush tool. Both tools paint over an image by using information from a previ-
ous state. The Art History Brush tool, however, includes several choices on 
the Options bar that let you apply brush-stroke effects to your image when 
you paint:
 
✓ Style: The Style menu contains various-shaped brush stroke styles, such 
as Tight Short, Loose Medium, Dab, or Loose Curl.
 
✓ Area: This option controls the area that the paint stroke covers, inde-
pendent of the brush size you select. The larger the brush size, the more 
area it covers.
 
✓ Tolerance: This option adjusts the amount of the change applied to 
your image. A low tolerance value lets you apply strokes anywhere in 
the image, regardless of color values. A high tolerance value limits Art 
History strokes to areas that are very different from the source state or 
snapshot, making your image not quite as dramatically different from 
the original.
You can use these options to create an interesting hand-painted effect, 
which you can control quite easily after you have some practice.
The Art History Brush tool often works best when you use a state that’s 
quite different from the state you’re painting over. For example, you can 
When Photoshop won’t let you go back
Sometimes, you may see a No symbol (a slashed 
circle) when you try to use the Eraser with the 
Erase to History option, the History Brush tool, 
or the Fill with History command. Your cur-
rent image must be the same file size (have 
the same number of pixels) as the state you’re 
trying to go back to. Actions such as cropping, 
trimming, using the Image Size or Canvas Size 
commands, or rotating any amount other than 
180 degrees can prevent you from going back 
to a previous state. However, if you happen 
to have a square image, you can still use the 
Eraser with the Erase to History option if you 
rotate that image in 90-degree increments.

apply a heavy filter that makes the image almost unrecognizable and then 
use that filtered image to paint with the Art History Brush tool. You can even 
completely fill an image with color or texture, and work with that.
To paint with the Art History Brush tool, follow these steps:
 
1. Apply any effects that you want to use to a chosen state.
 
 See Book V, Chapter 4 for the details on effects.
 
 I started by applying a Cutout filter to my sunflower and then fading the 
filter to 40% (Edit➪Fade Cutout).
 
2. Click in the far-left column in the History panel to select the state that 
you want to use as the source for the Art History Brush tool, as shown 
in Figure 4-6.

3. Select the Art History Brush tool from the Tools panel.
 
 You can also press Y to select it.
 
4. Select from the choices on the Options bar.
 
 Several of the options, such as Brush, Mode, and Opacity, are similar to 
the options available with the ordinary Brush tool. The new options are 
Style, Area, and Tolerance.
 
5. Paint with the brush to get the effect you want.
 
Don’t forget that you can use the History panel to reverse Art History 
strokes if you change your mind about them!

Chapter 5: Creating Actions 
for Productivity and Fun
In This Chapter
✓ Working with actions in the Actions panel
✓ Playing preset actions
✓ Recording a new action
✓ Editing and organizing actions
✓ Using actions sets
✓ Processing batches of files
✓ Creating droplet applets
P
ractice makes perfect — but when repeating the same 
steps in Photoshop over and over, the result is 
often tedium and impatience. You wouldn’t want to 
have to reinvent the wheel each time you go for a 
spin around the block, so why repeat the actions 
that carry out specific tasks in Photoshop if you 
don’t have to? Photoshop lets you record steps 
by using a fast and fun feature called Actions. 
Photoshop also has presets for popular actions, 
such as creating a wood frame, simulating water 
reflections, or providing a molten-lead look. This 
chapter shows you how to take advantage of 
Photoshop’s presets, as well as its macro-recording 
and editing capabilities.
Using the Actions Panel
Not surprisingly, Photoshop has a panel dedicated to the automation of var-
ious chores. To view the Actions panel, choose Window➪Actions (or press 
F9 on a PC, Opt+F9 on the Mac) or click the Actions icon in the dock. You 
can view the Actions panel in two different modes, Button and List. Each 
mode is useful in its own way. You can access the mode you’re not currently 
using via the Actions panel pop-up menu:

Introducing Preset Actions
206
 
✓ Button mode: A convenient, compact mode that hides all the inner work-
ings of the actions, presenting only a list of buttons that you can click to 
trigger a particular macro. Button mode is fast and easy; just click and go.
 
✓ List mode: Shown in Figure 5-1, is the default 
display in which each action appears as a 
folder-like heading. You can open a heading 
to reveal all the steps within that action or 
collapse the heading to hide those steps. You 
need to be in List mode when you record an 
action and when you edit individual steps. 
List mode also lets you perform only a select 
number of the steps in an action.
When you’re working in List mode, the Actions 
panel has these three columns:
 
✓ The left column: Contains check boxes that 
you can select or deselect to include or 
exclude actions (or steps within an action).
 
✓ The middle column: Toggles on or off 
whether actions display dialog boxes. Some 
actions include options that you can select 
while running the macro. For example, the 
Vignette (Selection) action, which creates a 
faded frame around a selection, includes a 
dialog box that lets you specify the width of 
the fading. This dialog box appears only after 
you select this middle column; if you deselect 
the column, the action uses a default value. 
Adobe refers to this setting as Modal control.
 
✓ The right column: This widest column shows 
the name of the set of actions (folder icon) 
or the individual action. Click the right-pointing arrow to the left of 
the action’s name to reveal the individual steps of the action. If you’ve 
assigned any keyboard shortcuts to your action, they also appear in this 
column.
Introducing Preset Actions
Preset actions are actions that have been created by the kind folks at Adobe 
and come with Photoshop. You can also get other preset actions from 
Adobe’s Web site, as well as from third-party vendors. You may need to load 
an action into the panel so that it’s ready to use. After an action is loaded, 
you can apply all the steps in that action in one fell swoop by playing the 
action. The following sections explain how to work with preset actions in 
more detail.
Figure 5-1: The Actions panel 
lets you create and store 
actions — a set of recorded 
steps that automate repetitive 
tasks.

Introducing Preset Actions
207
Book II
Chapter 5
Creating Actions for 
Productivity and Fun
Loading preset actions
Photoshop’s preset actions are located in a series of files in the Actions 
folder. The default actions are loaded by, um, default when you first open 
Photoshop. However, you can open and use other preset actions. They 
include Frames (for putting frames around your images), Text Effects (for 
enhancing your text), and Image Effects (which let you give your image the 
appearance of being aged or neon, for example).
Follow these steps to load preset actions:
 
1. In the Actions panel, click the panel pop-up menu arrow and select 
Load Actions.
 
 In the Load dialog box, Photoshop opens the Actions folder in the 
Presets folder. This folder contains several sets of actions presets. If 
the folder is empty, navigate to C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe 
Photoshop CS4\Presets\Actions. (On the Mac go to Macintosh 
HD\Applications\Adobe Photoshop CS4\Presets\Actions.)
 
2. Select one of the actions sets.
 
3. Click the Load button.
 
 Even easier, Photoshop’s additional actions presets also appear at the 
bottom of the Actions panel pop-up menu. You can add any of them to 
your current list of actions by selecting the set’s name.
 
 The new actions presets appear in the Actions panel, appended below 
the default actions that are already there. You can show or hide the 
actions in the Default Actions or any of the other sets by clicking the 
expand/collapse arrow in the third column.
 
You can also make actions available — or unavailable — for an entire set by 
clicking the first column in the Actions panel to the left of the actions set’s 
folder icon.
Here are some other tidbits about loading and working with preset actions:
 
✓ Any actions sets that you create yourself (as I describe in the section 
“Creating and Saving Actions Sets,” later in this chapter) appear in the 
pop-up menu if you save them in the Photoshop Actions folder. If you 
save them somewhere other than the Actions folder, you can navigate to 
that folder by using the usual file navigation commands.
 
✓ To remove the existing actions and replace them with the set you’re 
loading, select Replace Actions from the panel pop-up menu.
 
✓ To reset the Actions panel to the Default Actions set (removing all other 
sets that you may have loaded), select Reset Actions from the panel 
pop-up menu.

Introducing Preset Action
208
 
✓ To clear all actions from the Actions panel, select Clear All Actions from 
the panel pop-up menu. (You might want to do this if you’re creating 
your own set of actions from scratch.)
 
✓ To rename an actions set, select it and then select Set Options from the 
panel pop-up menu.
 
If you do a Google search for Photoshop Actions, you get a barrage of user-
created actions, ranging from functional to funky. You can save these 
actions to your computer so that you can then load them into Photoshop. 
Remember: Check any file that you download from the Internet for viruses 
and other malware, using an antivirus program or a similar utility.
Playing a preset action
You perform an action on an image by 
playing that action. To play a preset 
action, just open the file that you want 
to apply the action to, and then do one 
of the following:
 
✓ In Button mode, click the action 
that you want to play. You don’t 
have any other options.
 
 ✓ In List mode, select the action that 
you want to play, and then click 
the Play Selection button at the 
bottom of the Actions panel or 
select Play from the panel pop-up 
menu.
 
If you want to play back just one step 
of an action (say, for testing purposes), 
select the step that you want to play in 
List mode, and then Ctrl-click (Ô-click 
on the Mac) the Play button in the 
Actions panel. You can also simply 
double-click the step in the list while 
holding down the Ctrl key (the Ô key 
on the Mac).
If all goes well, your original image 
transforms with a mere click of the 
mouse, as shown in Figure 5-2.

Creating a New Action
209
Book II
Chapter 5
Creating Actions for 
Productivity and Fun
Creating a New Action
When you create an action, you automate a series of steps. The hardest part 
about creating a new action is figuring out what functions you want to auto-
mate. Think about steps that you carry out over and over, and whether you 
could be more productive if you had an action that could do them for you. 
For example, you might want to create your own action to reduce images to 
a constant width of 500 pixels for display in an eBay auction. However, per-
forming color-correction tasks for your eBay images is more difficult to auto-
mate because your images may vary in their original color and contrast.
After you decide what you want to automate, examine the actual steps so 
that you can record them. After you record the steps, creating a new action 
involves little more than starting Photoshop’s macro recorder and carrying 
out the steps that you want to include in the action.
 
While you’re working out the kinks in your action, I highly recommend that 
you do so on a copy of your original file. That way, if things go awry, your 
original file is safe from harm.
Here are the steps to follow to create a new action:
 
1. Open an image.
 
2. Display the Actions panel in List mode by unchecking Button 
Mode in the panel pop-up menu.
 
 3. Click the Create New Action 
button at the bottom of the 
Actions panel.
 
 You can also select New Action 
from the panel pop-up menu.
 
 The New Action dialog box opens, 
as shown in Figure 5-3.
 
4. In the Name text box, enter a name 
for the action.
 
5. In the Set pop-up menu, select the actions set in which you want to 
save the new action.
 
 An actions set is merely a folder that contains individual actions for orga-
nizational purposes. Feel free to use an existing set or create your own.
 
6. (Optional) To associate the action with a function-key shortcut, select 
the name of the function key from the Function Key drop-down list.
Figure 5-3: Name your new action and 
specify your other options.

Editing and Managing Actions
210
 
 This step associates the action with a button on the keyboard. 
Associating an action with a function key, such as F2, F3, and so on, 
can cut down the time it takes you to perform common actions. But try 
to use keyboard shortcuts that aren’t already associated with other 
Photoshop tasks.
 
 Select the Shift or Ctrl (Shift or Ô on the Mac) check box to use either of 
these keys along with the function key.
 
 Any keyboard shortcut that you assign to an action overrides the default 
function already assigned to the keyboard shortcut. Keep in mind 
that a few exceptions exist in which the operating system wins in the 
case of a conflict. You can revert to the original shortcut by choosing 
Edit➪Keyboard Shortcuts. See Book I, Chapter 5 for details.
 
7. In the Color drop-down list, select a color to mark your action in 
Button mode.
 
 This option enables you to group related actions by color.
 
8. Click the Record button in the New Action dialog box to begin recording.
 
9. Carry out all the steps that you want to record.
 
10. Click the Stop Playing/Recording button at the bottom of the Actions 
panel to finish the action.
 
 Your new action appears in the Actions panel, in both List and Button 
modes.
Editing and Managing Actions
The first thing to do after you create a new action is to try it out by open-
ing an image and clicking the Play button in the Actions panel. If the action 
doesn’t perform the way you expect, you may need to edit your action to 
fine-tune it. You also may need to edit an action to add features or change 
the action’s behavior in some way. (For example, you might decide that you 
want your resizing action to change the size to 45 percent, rather than 50 
percent.) Photoshop enables you to edit your actions fairly easily. Also, keep 
in mind that certain actions won’t run on certain files. For example, if your 
action involves adjusting the opacity of a layer and you run it on an image 
without layers, it won’t work. You’d have to include a step that creates a 
layer first.
You have a lot of editing options; you can change the action’s name, key-
board shortcut, or color coding. Just double-click the action name in the 
Actions panel and then enter a new name; or select the action, select Action 
Options from the panel pop-up menu, and change the information in the 
dialog box, as desired. You can also hold down the Alt key (Option key on 
the Mac) and double-click the action’s name in the Actions panel to open the 
Actions Options dialog box.

Editing and Managing Actions
211
Book II
Chapter 5
Creating Actions for 
Productivity and Fun
Re-recording an action
As easy as editing an action is, your best option is often to simply re-record 
the action from scratch. If the action isn’t long or complex, you can often re-
record it in less time then you’d spend editing the existing action. You can 
re-record an action two ways:
 
✓ Create a new action from scratch. Perform all the steps again to replace 
the old action with a new one, saving the action with the same (or a 
different) filename.
 
✓ Use the clever Record Again feature. Photoshop runs through the steps 
that you already recorded, opening the dialog boxes that you used the 
first time around so that you can enter new values.
 
 This Record Again method is very handy if you want to change just some 
of the parameters, keeping the steps the same and in the same order. 
You don’t even have to remember what steps you used. Photoshop runs 
through them for you while you record the steps, or macro, again.
 
 To re-record a macro with the Record Again option, select the name of 
the macro that you want to re-record and select Record Again from the 
panel pop-up menu. When the different dialog boxes appear, enter the 
new values that you want and click OK until the macro is finished.
Editing an action
You can edit individual steps of an action. Here are some of the editing 
changes that you can make:
 
✓ Move a step. To move a step from one place in the action to another, 
click the step that you want to relocate and drag it to its new place in 
the action list.
 
✓ Add a step in the middle. To add a new step in the middle of an existing 
action, select the step that you want to precede the new step. Click the 
Record button and perform the steps that you want to add. 
Click the Stop Recording button when you finish.
 
✓ Add a step to the end. To add a new step at the end of an existing 
action, select the name of the action, click the Record button, and per-
form the steps that you want to add. Click the Stop Recording button 
when you finish.
 
✓ Remove a step. Click the step that you want to delete and then either 
drag the step to the trash can icon, or click the trash icon and click OK 
in the dialog box that pops up. (Alt-click the trash icon [Option-click on 
the Mac] to bypass the dialog box and delete the step without confirma-
tion.) You can also select a step and select Delete from the panel pop-up 
menu.

Creating and Saving Actions Sets
212
 
✓ Duplicate a step. Hold down the 
Alt key (Option key on the Mac) 
and drag the step that you want 
to duplicate to another location in 
the Actions panel. Photoshop then 
creates a copy of the step, leaving 
the original step where it was, as 
shown in Figure 5-4.
 
You can remove or duplicate an 
entire action by using the procedures 
described in the preceding list for 
removing a step or duplicating a step.
Creating and Saving 
Actions Sets
If you create your own sets of actions, 
you may want to include them in 
custom sets that you can load or 
remove, as needed. Just follow these 
steps:
 
1. Display the Actions panel in List mode.
 
 2. Click the Create New Set button in the Actions panel or select New Set 
from the panel pop-up menu.
 
 The New Set dialog box appears.
 
3. Enter a name for your actions set in the New Set dialog box and 
click OK.
 
4. Drag any existing actions that you want to include from their locations 
in the Actions panel to a new location within your new set folder.
 
5. Create any new actions that you want to include within the new set.
 
 See the section “Creating a New Action,” earlier in this chapter.
 
6. Select the name of the set and choose Save Actions from the panel 
pop-up menu.
 
7. Save the set in the Actions folder (which you can find in the Presets 
folder within the Adobe Photoshop CS4 folder).
Figure 5-4: Duplicate a step in an action.

Batch Processing Actions
213
Book II
Chapter 5
Creating Actions for 
Productivity and Fun
Batch Processing Actions
Photoshop’s Batch feature lets you apply an action to a group of files. Suppose 
you want to make changes to a series of files. You can open each file in 
Photoshop, play the desired macro, and then save the file. But that might take 
a few minutes, or much longer if you have a lot of files to process. If you want 
to keep your original file, too, you have to remember to save each file in a new 
folder. Batch processing can automate tedious chores for you.
To try out this useful tool, copy some files (at least five or six) to a new 
folder and follow these steps:
 
1. Make sure that all the files are in 
a single folder of their own.
 
 Any subfolders will be included in 
that folder.
 
 Photoshop, by default, works on 
all the files in a folder. You have 
to use Adobe Bridge if you want to 
choose only some of those files by 
using the Batch feature. You can 
find out more about Adobe Bridge 
in Book I, Chapter 4.
 
2. Choose File➪Automate➪Batch.
 
 The Batch dialog box opens, as 
shown in Figure 5-5.
 
3. In the Set pop-up menu, select the 
set that contains the action you 
want to apply.
 
 If you have only one set of actions loaded, that set appears by default.
Slowing down action playback
When you play back an action to test it, the 
action may run too quickly for you to see exactly 
what’s going on. To slow things down, select 
Playback Options from the panel pop-up menu 
and select a playback speed in the Playback 
Options dialog box.
Select Accelerated to zip through an action 
at normal speed, Step by Step to command 
Photoshop to briefly stop between actions 
so that you can examine what’s happened, 
or Pause For to create a short pause before 
moving on. (Make sure that you specify for how 
many seconds you want to pause.) If you want 
to get really fancy, you can select the Pause 
for Audio Annotation check box and use your 
microphone to describe what each step does.
Figure 5-5: By batch processing an action 
on a group of files, you can take a coffee 
break and still get work done.

Batch Processing Actions
214
 
4. In the Action pop-up menu, select the action that you want to apply.
 
5. In the Source pop-up menu, select Folder.
 
 You can also select Opened Files to process files that you already 
opened in Photoshop, Import to process a series of files captured with 
your scanner or transferred from your digital camera, or Bridge to pro-
cess files that you selected in Adobe Bridge.
 
6. Click the Choose button, navigate to the folder that you want to use, 
and click OK (in Windows) or Choose (in Mac OS).
 
7. Select other options in the Source area, as desired.
 
 Here’s a description of your choices:
 
• Override Action “Open” Commands: Normally, Photoshop opens 
each of the files in the selected folder automatically and processes 
them — so your action doesn’t have to contain an Open command. 
However, if the macro does contain an Open command, select this 
option. With this option active, Photoshop overrides Open commands 
in the actions that use specific files (rather than the batched files).
 
• Include All Subfolders: Select this option to process files in subfold-
ers within the folder that you specify.
 
• Suppress File Open Options Dialogs: Select this option to have 
Photoshop disregard any options that could be possibly selected 
upon opening a file.
 
• Suppress Color Profile Warnings: When it opens a file that contains 
its own color profile, Photoshop asks whether you want to use that 
profile or Photoshop’s default profile. Selecting this check box sup-
presses that choice; Photoshop always uses its own default color 
profile. I explain color profiles in Book II, Chapter 3.
 
8. In the Destination area, tell Photoshop what to do with each file after 
the action has been applied to it.
 
 Choose one of the following options from the drop-down list:
 
• None: Leaves the file open on your Photoshop desktop without 
saving it (unless the action itself contains a Save command).
 
• Save and Close: Closes the files in the same folder in which 
Photoshop found them. Your original file is overwritten, so use this 
option only when you don’t want to save the original or you have 
another copy.
 
• Folder: Saves the document in a folder.
 
9. If you chose Folder in Step 8, click the Choose button and navigate to 
a destination folder for your files.
 
10. Select the Override Action “Save As” Commands check box to ignore 
any Save As parameters in the action and use the filenames of the files 
(as specified in the File Naming section described in Step 11).

Creating Droplets
215
Book II
Chapter 5
Creating Actions for 
Productivity and Fun
 
11. In the File Naming section, specify how you want Photoshop to create 
the filenames for the new, processed files by selecting options from 
the drop-down lists.
 
 You can select options from six pop-up menus, depending on how long 
and complicated you want the filenames to be. 
 
 When you process large numbers of files, these naming tools can help 
you keep track of when and how the files were created.
 
12. Select the Windows, Mac OS, or Unix check box to specify what operat-
ing system you want the saved filenames to be most compatible with.
 
13. In the Errors pop-up menu, select whether you want Photoshop to stop 
processing a batch when it encounters an error or whether you want 
it to simply continue and list the errors in a file. If you select the latter 
option, click the Save As button and, in the Save dialog box, specify a 
name and location for the log.
 
 If you want to apply several different actions to a single set of files or 
apply the same action to multiple folders of files, just create an action 
that includes multiple batch-processing directives. To process multiple 
folders, you can also deposit shortcuts (in Windows) or aliases (in Mac 
OS) to each of the additional folders in the main source folder, and then 
select the Include All Subfolders check box in the Source area.
 
14. When you finish selecting options in the Batch dialog box, click OK to 
start the batch processing.
Creating Droplets
Droplets are drag-and-drop mini-applications — essentially applets — in 
macro form that can exist outside of Photoshop on your desktop, on your 
taskbar, or within a folder. They’re always available, so you can apply them 
to any image files you want. Think of them as batches waiting to happen.
You just need to drag the file or files that you want to process onto the drop-
let. Photoshop doesn’t even have to be open at the time. When you drop 
the file or files, the droplet opens Photoshop and carries out the steps in 
the action embedded in the droplet’s instructions. You must use an existing 
action as the core of the droplet.
To create a droplet, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪Automate➪Create Droplet.
 
 The Create Droplet dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 5-6.
 
2. In the Save Droplet In area, click the Choose button and enter a name 
and location on your hard drive for the droplet application.

Creating Droplets
216
 
 The location isn’t of overriding 
importance because after you 
create the droplet you can drag 
it to your desktop, a toolbar, or 
wherever you like.
 
 The rest of the Create Droplet 
dialog box is the same as the Batch 
Processing dialog box (described 
in the preceding section), except 
that you don’t have to specify 
a source. Droplets use the files 
dropped on them as their source

Selections

f there’s one technique that separates the 
really good Photoshop users from the wan-
nabes, it’s the ability to make a top-notch selec-
tion. Pick up any tabloid and you’ll agree with me 
that a lot of those wannabes seem to be gainfully 
employed! This book, along with Book VI, gives 
you a complete arsenal of selection commands, 
methods, and techniques. In this book, I give you 
information on how to create and modify selec-
tions and paths by using various Photoshop tools, 
such as the Marquee, Lasso, Magic Wand, Quick 
Selection tool, and Pen tools. After you go through 
this book, you can put those wannabes to shame.

✓ Roping selections with the Lasso tools
✓ Picking up pixels with the Magic Wand tool
✓ Selecting quickly to save time
N
o matter how much you know about Photoshop, if you can’t make 
a good selection, your work will look like it belongs with the cre-
atively (but poorly) composed images in those weekly tabloid rags. You 
know what I’m talking about — those pictures that go alongside headlines 
like “Bat Boy Wins Bake-Off” and “Woman with 16 Fingers Wins Typing 
Contest.”
 
Making accurate selections is the key to creating 
and editing images effectively so that the end result 
looks flawless. Fortunately, Photoshop offers a 
bevy of tools and techniques for creating selec-
tions, from the simple to the complex. Photoshop 
offers three basic methods of creating a selection: 
using a selection tool or method, using the Pen 
tool, or creating a mask.
In this chapter, I give you the foundation you need 
to use the selection and Pen tools. In fact, the rest 
of Book III covers these tools in detail. I cover the 
more complex method of masking in Book VI.
Defining Selections
The tools I discuss in this chapter require you to 
take a little piece of a larger image so that you can dig in and make some 
serious edits. Defining a selection means that you specify which part of the 

220
Marqueeing When You Can
image you want to work with. Everything within a selection is fair game for 
manipulation and is considered selected. Everything outside the selection 
is protected, or unselected. Simple enough, right? Well, you can also have 
partially selected pixels. Confused yet? A partially selected pixel has usually 
been anti-aliased, feathered, or masked. (I cover anti-aliasing and feathering 
in the section “Using the Marquee options,” later in this chapter. You can 
find out about masking in Book VI.)
 
When you use a selection tool to define a selection, a moving dotted outline 
called a selection marquee appears.
Marqueeing When You Can
Photoshop geeks call the selection marquee by a variety of names. 
Sometimes it’s referred to as a marquee, other times as a selection, and you 
might even hear people call it a selection outline, an outline, selection edges, 
or just plain old edges. A favorite name for these dotted lines is marching 
ants. Throughout the book, I usually call them selection marquees. Boring? 
Maybe. Accurate? Yup. Whatever you want to call the selection marquee, 
how you create one depends on the particular Marquee tool or command 
you use.
The Marquee tools are the easiest selection tools to use — so I suggest that 
you use them when you can.
 
In the Photoshop repertoire of tools, you find four types of Marquee tools: 
Rectangular Marquee, Elliptical Marquee, Single Row Marquee, and Single 
Column Marquee.
Using the Rectangular Marquee tool
The Rectangular Marquee tool creates rectangular or square selections. Use 
this tool when you want to zero in on an image, plucking it out of a larger 
background to provide a better focal point.
Follow these steps to make a selection with the Rectangular Marquee tool:
 
1. Select the Rectangular Marquee tool from the Tools panel.
 
 You can also use the keyboard shortcut — press the M key.
 
2. Click and drag from one corner of the area that you want to select to 
the opposite corner.

221
Book III
Chapter 1
Making 
Selections
Marqueeing When You Can
 
 While you drag, the selection mar-
quee appears. The marquee fol-
lows the movement of your mouse 
cursor (a crosshair or plus sign 
icon). For example, in Figure 1-1, 
I dragged from the lower-left 
corner to the upper-right corner.
 
3. Release your mouse button.
 
 You now have a full-fledged rectan-
gular selection.
 
If you want to create a perfect square, 
hold down the Shift key after you begin 
dragging. When you have your desired 
selection, release the mouse button 
and then the Shift key.
If you want to drag your selection 
from the center outward, rather than 
from corner to corner, hold down the 
Alt (Option on the Mac) key after you 
begin dragging. When you have your 
desired selection, release your mouse 
button and then release the Alt (Option 
on the Mac) key.
Using the Elliptical 
Marquee tool
The Elliptical Marquee tool is designed for elliptical or circular selections. 
You can easily select objects such as clocks, balls, and full moons by using 
this tool.
When you select with the Elliptical Marquee tool, you don’t drag from corner 
to corner; you drag from a given point on the ellipse, which makes the pro-
cess a little tougher. Here are the steps:
 
1. Select the Elliptical Marquee tool from the Marquee flyout menu in 
the Tools panel.
 
 You can also use the keyboard shortcut. If the Elliptical Marquee tool is 
visible, press the M key. If the Rectangular Marquee is visible, you must 
press Shift+M.

2. Position the crosshair near the area that you want to select and then 
drag around your desired element.
 
 While you drag, the selection marquee appears.
 
 You may find it easier to create an elliptical selection by holding down 
the Alt (Option on the Mac) key and dragging from the center outward. 
First, click the mouse button, and then before you move the mouse, hold 
down Alt (Option on the Mac) and drag. Release your mouse and then 
the key when you have your desired selection. If you want to draw from 
the center out and want a perfect circle, hold down the Shift key, as well. 
When you have your desired selection, release your mouse button and 
then the Shift+Alt (Shift+Option on the Mac) keys. This technique works 
for creating squares, also.
 
3. When you’re satisfied with your 
selection, release your mouse 
button.
 
 Your elliptical selection is alive 
and well, as shown in Figure 1-2.
 
• If you need to move the selec-
tion marquee to better center 
your selection, click and drag 
inside the marquee.
 
• You can move a selection with 
any of the Marquee tools by 
pressing the spacebar while 
you’re drawing.
 
• If the selection isn’t quite the 
right shape and size, jump to 
Book III, Chapter 2 to find out 
how to make perfect selections.
Using the Single Column and 
Single Row Marquee tools
The Single Row and Single Column Marquee tools select a single row or 
single column of pixels. If you don’t go blind using them, these tools can 
occasionally come in handy for selecting and repairing a thin scratch or fold 
line on an image, or for getting rid of an artifact, such as a colored line, that 
has somehow appeared on a scanned image. (You can find out more about 
making repairs in Book VIII.)
To use either of these tools, simply click the row or column of pixels that 
you want to work on. You don’t have to do any dragging, but it does help to 
zoom into your image so that you can better position the tool on the offend-
ing row or column.

Marqueeing When You Can
For more on zooming, see Book I, Chapter 4. Check out Figure 1-3 to get 
familiar with a single row selection.
 
The Single Row and Single Column Marquee tools don’t have keyboard 
shortcuts, so you’re stuck with having to click the tools to select them.
Using the Marquee options
If drawing from the center outward or creating a perfect circle or square 
doesn’t give you enough control, you may want to take a look at the mar-
quee settings provided by the Options bar. These options allow you to make 
even more precise selections by specifying exact measurements.
 
You must select the options on the Options bar before you make your selec-
tion with the Marquee tools.
For now, you can ignore the first five icons on the left side of the Options 
bar, as shown in Figure 1-4. The first icon has to do with tool presets, which 
I cover in Book I, Chapter 2. The next four icons are the selection-state icons 
(which I discuss in Book III, Chapter 3).

Here’s the lowdown on each of the remaining options:
 
✓ Feather: Feathering softens, or feathers, the edges of a selection. The 
amount of softening depends on the radius — the higher the radius, the 
softer the edge, as shown in Figure 1-5. The radius measures how far in 
all directions the feather effect extends.

225
Book III
Chapter 1
Making 
Selections
Marqueeing When You Can
 
 You can use feathering to create a subtle and natural transition between 
selections or to create a special effect in which an image slowly fades 
out to the background or to transparency. To feather while you’re 
selecting, select the Feather option on the Options bar before you use 
the Marquee tools. You can feather a selection after the fact by using the 
Select➪Modify submenu. Check out Book III, Chapter 2 for more feather-
ing details.
 
✓ Anti-Alias: Whereas feathering completely blurs edges, anti-aliasing 
just slightly softens the edge of an elliptical selection so that very hard, 
jagged edges aren’t quite so prominent, as shown in Figure 1-6. You 
don’t have an option in which you can enter a pixel value for anti-
aliasing. An anti-aliased edge is always 1 pixel wide.
 
 For the most part, I recommend keeping the Anti-Alias option selected, 
especially if you plan to create composite images. Anti-aliasing helps 
create natural-looking blends between multiple selections. However, if 
want a crisp, linear edge, uncheck this option.

✓ Style: The Style drop-down list contains three settings:
 
• Normal: This setting enables you to freely drag a selection to any 
desired dimension.
 
• Fixed Aspect Ratio: This option allows you to specify a ratio of width 
to height in a selection. For example, if you enter 2 for width and 1 
for height, you always get a marquee selection that’s twice as wide as 
it is high, no matter what the size.
 
• Fixed Size: Select this option to specify exact values for the Width 
and Height. This option comes in handy when several images need to 
be the same exact size, such as in a row of headshots in a corporate 
brochure.
 
✓ Width and Height: When you select a Fixed Size from the Style drop-
down list, you can enter values in the Width and Height text boxes. 
To swap the Width and Height values, click the double-headed arrow 
button.
 
 Even though the default unit of measurement in the Width and Height 
text boxes is pixels (px for short), you can enter any unit of measure-
ment that Photoshop recognizes — pixels, inches, centimeters, millime-
ters, points, picas, or percents. After the number, simply type the word 
or abbreviation of your desired unit of measurement. Photoshop even 
lets you enter mixed units of measurements, so if you want a selection 
100 pixels by 1.25 inches, you can specify that.
 
✓ Refine Edges: Although you prob-
ably won’t need to fine-tune a 
simple marquee selection, that’s 
what this option does. You can 
apply Refine Edges to any selec-
tion, and it appears in the Options 
bar of the Marquee, Lasso, Magic 
Wand, and Quick Selection (where 
it’ll come in handy) tools. You 
can also apply this command to 
any existing selection by choos-
ing Select➪Refine Edge. Here’s the 
lowdown on the settings in this 
option, shown in Figure 1-7:
 
• Radius: Improves the edge of 
the selection where it has soft 
transitions or a lot of detail. Be 
sure to check Preview if you 
want to see the effect.
 
• Contrast: Removes artifacts 
while tightening soft edges by 
increasing the contrast.

all the modes, simply press the F key.
 
• Zoom tool: Enables you to zoom into your image to see the effects of 
your settings.
 
• Hand tool: Lets you pan around your document window to see the

• Default: Click the Default button to revert your settings back to the 
Photoshop default. Hold down Alt (Option on the Mac) and click the 
Reset button that appears to revert to the settings when you first 
opened the Refine Edge dialog box.
Lassoing (When You Can’t Marquee)
Unfortunately, not much in life is perfectly rectangular or elliptical in shape. 
Most of the time, you have to deal with irregular shapes that have extrusions 
and protrusions (otherwise known as bumps or bulges) of some sort. That’s 
where the Lasso tools come in handy. This group of tools allows you to 
make freeform selections.
Photoshop offers three Lasso tools: the Lasso tool itself (which I call the reg-
ular Lasso to distinguish it from the others), the Polygonal Lasso tool, and 
the Magnetic Lasso tool. Each of the Lasso tools has its own special purpose 
in the realm of freeform selections. But, in the category of simplicity, they’re 
all almost as easy to use as the Marquee tools. You just have to drag around 
the part of the image that you want to select. Just don’t indulge in too much 
caffeine. A steady lasso hand is a good lasso hand.
The selection you make is only as good as how accurately you can trace 
around your desired element. If you don’t make an exact selection the first 
time around, you can always go back and make corrections (which I cover in 
Book III, Chapter 3).
 
If, when making a selection, you find yourself fighting with your mouse (and 
losing), you may want to invest in a digital drawing tablet, such as a Wacom 
tablet. Using the stylus and the tablet can make mastering tools such as the 
Lasso a whole lot easier.

228
Lassoing (When You Can’t Marquee)
 
The Lasso and Polygonal Lasso tools both have only three choices on the 
Options bar to worry about — Feather, Anti-Aliased, and Refine Edges. These 
options work exactly like they do with the Marquee tools. To find out more, 
check out the earlier section “Using the Marquee options.”
To make a selection by using the Lasso tool, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the Lasso tool from the Tools panel.
 
 It’s the tool that looks like (well, yeah) a rope. You can also use the key-
board shortcut; press the L key.
 
2. Position the cursor somewhere on the edge of the element that you 
want to select.
 
 The hot spot (the lead point) of the Lasso cursor is the end of the rope. 
If you need a little visual assistance, press your Caps Lock key, which 
switches your cursor to a crosshair.
 
 Zoom in on the image a bit if the element and the background don’t have 
a lot of contrast.
 
 In my example, I started at the top of the butte, as shown in Figure 1-8.

3. Trace around the element and try to capture only what you want to 
retain in your selection.
 
 While you trace, a line forms that follows the movement of your mouse.
 
 Don’t release your mouse button until you complete the selection by 
returning to the starting point to close the loop. When you release your 
mouse button, Photoshop thinks you’re done and closes the selection, 
as shown in Figure 1-9.

4. Continue tracing until you return to your starting point; release the 
mouse button.
 
 Recognizing that you’re now done, Photoshop presents you with a selec-
tion marquee that matches your Lasso line (see Figure 1-10).
Selecting straight sides with 
the Polygonal Lasso tool
Whereas the regular Lasso tool is great for selecting undulating, curvy elements, 
the Polygonal Lasso tool shines when it comes to the more regimented, straight-
sided subjects, such as city skylines, buildings, and stairways.

Figure 1-10: After tracing around your object, release your mouse, and Photoshop presents 
you with an accurate selection marquee.
 
Unlike the regular Lasso tool, the Polygonal Lasso tool has rubber-band-like 
qualities, and instead of dragging, you click and release the mouse button at 
the corners of the object that you’re selecting. It’s like a digital connect-the-
dots. (Bonus: Less manual dexterity required.)
The following steps show you how to select with the Polygonal Lasso tool:
 
1. Select the Polygonal Lasso tool in the Tools panel.
 
 You can also use the keyboard shortcut. Press the L key and then press 
Shift+L until you get the Polygonal Lasso tool. It looks like the regular 
Lasso tool, but it has straight sides.
 
2. With the Polygonal Lasso tool selected, click to establish the begin-
ning of the first line of your selection.
 
 A corner is always a good place to start.

231
Book III
Chapter 1
Making 
Selections
Lassoing (When You Can’t Marquee)
 
3. Move the mouse and click at the next corner of the object. Then, con-
tinue clicking at the various corners of your object.
 
 The line stretches out from each corner that you click, like a rubber 
band.
 
4. To close your selection, return to the first point that you clicked and 
click one last time.
 
 When you place your cursor over the starting point, a small circle 
appears next to your cursor, a sure sign that you’re at the right place for 
closing the selection. A selection marquee that matches your Polygonal 
Lasso line appears, as shown in Figure 1-11.
 
Which tool do you use if you have an object with both curves and straight 
sides? You can have two, two, two tools in one! Hold down the Alt (Option 
on the Mac) key to have the Polygonal Lasso tool temporarily transform into 
the regular Lasso tool. Then, click and drag to select the curves. Release the 
Alt (Option) key to return to the Polygonal Lasso tool. This trick works with 
the other Lasso tools, as well.

Lassoing (When You Can’t Marquee)
Attracting with the Magnetic Lasso tool
The last member of the lasso tool trio is the Magnetic Lasso, which I admit 
can be kind of tricky to use and sometimes even downright obstinate. The 
Magnetic Lasso tool works by analyzing the colors of the pixels between the 
elements in the foreground and the elements in the background. Then, it 
snaps to the edge between the elements, as if the edge had a magnetic pull.
 
The Magnetic Lasso tool performs best when your image has a lot of con-
trast between the foreground and background elements — for example, a 
dark mountain range against a light sky or a shadow against a stucco wall.
The Magnetic Lasso tool also has some unique settings — which you can 
adjust on the Options bar — to tame its behavior. I cover those settings in 
the following section. For now, follow these steps to use the tool:
 
1. Select the Magnetic Lasso tool in the Tools panel.
 
 You can also use the keyboard shortcut: Press the L key and then press 
Shift+L until you get the Magnetic Lasso tool. The tool looks like a 
straight-sided lasso with a little magnet on it.
 
2. Click the edge of the object you 
want to select.
 
 You can start anywhere; just be 
sure to click the edge between the 
element you want and the back-
ground you don’t want.
 
3. Move your cursor around the 
object, without clicking.
 
 The Magnetic Lasso tool creates 
a selection line similar to the 
other lasso tools. It also adds 
little squares, called points, along 
that selection line, as shown in 
Figure 1-12. These points pin down 
the selection line the way you 
might section off an area of your 
yard with ropes and stakes.
 
 Here are a couple more tips to 
keep in mind when working with 
the Magnetic Lasso tool:
 
• If the Magnetic Lasso tool starts 
veering off the edge of your 
object, back up your mouse 
and click to force a point down 
on the line.

Selections
Lassoing (When You Can’t Marquee)
 
• If the Magnetic Lasso tool adds a point where you don’t want one, 
simply press your Backspace (Delete on a Mac) key to delete it.
 
4. Continue moving your mouse around the object; return to your start-
ing point and click the mouse button to close the selection.
 
 Like with the Polygonal Lasso tool, a small circle appears next to your 
cursor, indicating that you’re at the correct place to close the selection. 
The selection marquee appears when the selection is closed.
Adjusting the Magnetic Lasso options
The Magnetic Lasso tool comes equipped with a few settings on the Options 
bar that control the sensitivity of the tool.
 
I recommend starting out by messing around with the Magnetic Lasso tool using 
its default settings. If the tool isn’t cooperating, then play with the options.
The first icon, on the far left, has to do with tool presets, and the next four 
icons are the selection state icons (check out Book III, Chapter 2). The 
Feather, Anti-Alias, and Refine Edge options work like they do with the 
Marquee tools (see the earlier section “Using the Marquee options”). The fol-
lowing list explains the remaining options:
 
✓ Width: This option, measured in pixels from 1 to 256, determines how 
close to the edge you have to move your mouse before the Magnetic 
Lasso tool recognizes the object you’re selecting. Decrease the value 
if the object’s edge has a lot of indentations and protrusions or if the 
image has low contrast. Increase the value if the image has high contrast 
or smooth edges.
 
 When using the Magnetic Lasso tool, you can change the Width value 
from the keyboard by pressing the left bracket ( [ ) key to lower the 
value and the right bracket ( ] ) key to increase the value.
 
✓ Edge Contrast: Measured in percentages from 1 to 100, this option 
specifies the required contrast between the object you’re selecting and 
its background before the Magnetic Lasso tool hugs the edge between 
them. If your image has good contrast between the foreground and back-
ground, use a high percentage.
 
✓ Frequency: This setting, measured in percentages from 0 to 100, speci-
fies how many points to place on the selection line. The higher the per-
centage, the greater number of points. If the object you want to select 
has a fairly smooth edge, keep the percentage low. If the edge is jagged 
or has a lot of detail, a high percentage may be more effective in getting 
an accurate selection line.
 
✓ Tablet Pressure (Pen icon): If you own a pressure-sensitive drawing 
tablet, select this option to make an increase in stylus pressure cause 
the edge width to decrease.

Performing Wand Wizardry
Performing Wand Wizardry
The Magic Wand. The name is intriguing, isn’t it? Any tool that has the 
audacity to call itself the Magic Wand must be so powerful that it can grant 
your every selection wish with a mere swoosh. Unfortunately, it’s not quite 
so awe-inspiring. A better name for this tool would be the Click-’n-Select tool. 
You click your image, and the Magic Wand tool makes a selection that con-
tains areas of similar color based on the color of the pixel you clicked.
Simple enough. What’s not quite so simple is how to determine how similar the 
color has to be to get the Magic Wand tool to select it. That’s where the impor-
tant Tolerance setting comes in. Before you tackle tolerance (and find out how 
it affects the Magic Wand tool’s performance), you first need to get the hang of 
using the Magic Wand tool. In case you haven’t used the Magic Wand before, I 
ordered the following sections with this in mind, so read them in order.
Selecting with the Magic 
Wand tool
Like with the Magnetic Lasso tool (cov-
ered in the section “Attracting with the 
Magnetic Lasso tool,” earlier in this chap-
ter), the Magic Wand tool works best 
when you have high-contrast images or 
images that have a limited number of 
colors. As shown in Figure 1-13, a black-
and-white checkered flag is a perfect 
example of something that the Magic 
Wand tool effectively selects. I click the 
top of a black square, and the Magic 
Wand tool picks up all the other sur-
rounding black pixels. I can now easily 
change the color of my black squares to 
red or yellow in one fell swoop.
As you can see, Figure 1-14 is a poor 
candidate for the Magic Wand tool. 
This image contains a ton of colors — 
and no definitive contrast between the 
glass, the wine, and the background. 
Although it takes only one click to 
select the black squares on the flag, 
other high-contrast candidates may 
take a few clicks. And some images 
may need you to make a tweak or two 
to the Tolerance setting, described in 
the following section.

best on images with limited colors.

Setting your tolerance
Sometimes, an image may contain a few shades of a similar color. Consider 
a cloudless sky, for example. A few shades of blue make up the bright blue 
yonder. By using the Magic Wand tool, if you click a darker shade of blue in 
the sky, Photoshop selects all similar shades of blue, but the lighter shades 
remain unselected. This is usually a sure sign that you need to increase your 
Tolerance level. The Tolerance setting determines the range of color that the 
Magic Wand tool selects.
Tolerance is based on brightness levels that range from 0 to 255:
 
✓ Setting the Tolerance to 0 selects one color only.
 
✓ Setting the Tolerance to 255 selects all colors — the entire image.
To use the Magic Wand tool and adjust Tolerance settings, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Select the Magic Wand tool in the Tools panel.
 
 The Magic Wand tool now shares the Quick Selection tool’s flyout 
menu (the Quick Selection tool is explained in the section “Saving Time 
with the Quick Selection Tool,” later in this chapter). Press the W key 
and then press Shift+W until you get a tool that looks like the weapon 
of choice for many Disney characters.
 
2. Click the portion of the image that you want to select; use the default 
Tolerance setting of 32.
 
 The pixel that you click determines the base color. The default value of 
32 means that the Magic Wand tool selects all colors that are 16 levels 
lighter and 16 levels darker than the base color.
 
 If you selected everything you wanted the first time you used the Magic 
Wand tool, stretch your arm and give yourself a pat on the back. If you 
didn’t (which is probably the case), go to Step 3.
 
3. Enter a new Tolerance setting on the Options bar.
 
 If the Magic Wand tool selected more than you wanted it to, lower the 
Tolerance setting. If it didn’t select enough, raise the setting.
 
4. Click the portion of the image that you want to select.
 
 Changing the Tolerance level doesn’t adjust your current selection.
 
 The Magic Wand tool deselects the current selection and makes a new 
selection — based on your new Tolerance setting, as shown in Figure 1-15. 
If it still isn’t right, you can adjust the Tolerance setting again. I regret that 
I can’t give you a magic formula that you can use to determine the right 
value. It’s all about trial and error.

Using the Magic Wand Options bar
If you get a selection close to what you want, stop there and then use the 
selection-refining techniques I discuss in Book III, Chapter 2. But before you do 
that, you need to know about the other Magic Wand settings on the Options 
bar. Besides Anti-Alias and Refine Edge, which I discuss in the earlier section 
“Using the Marquee options,” the three remaining options are as follows:
 
✓ Contiguous: When you turn on this option, the Magic Wand tool selects 
only pixels that are adjacent to each other. If you turn off the option, the 
Magic Wand tool selects all pixels within the range of tolerance, whether 
or not they’re adjacent to each other.
 
✓ Sample All Layers: This option is valid only when you have multiple 
layers in your image. (For more on layers, see Book V.) If you have 
multiple layers and this option is on, the Magic Wand tool selects color 
from all visible layers. If you turn off this option, the Magic Wand selects 
colors from the active layer only.

✓ Sample Size: Although this option affects the Magic Wand tool, it 
appears on the Options bar only when you select the Eyedropper 
tool. (For more on the Eyedropper, see Book II, Chapter 3.) Select the 
Eyedropper tool and, in the Sample Size pop-up menu that appears, 
select from the following options:
 
• Point Sample: Samples just the color of the pixel you clicked
 
• 3 by 3 Average: Averages the color of the pixel you clicked and the 
surrounding eight pixels
 
• 5 by 5 Average: Averages the color of the pixel you clicked and the 
surrounding 24 pixels
 
• 11 by 11 Average: Averages the color of the pixel you clicked and 
the surrounding 120 pixels
 
• 31 by 31 Average: Averages the color of the pixel you clicked and 
the surrounding 960 pixels
 
• 51 by 51 Average: Averages the color of the pixel you clicked and 
the surrounding 2600 pixels
 
• 101 by 101 Average: Averages the color of the pixel you clicked and 
the surrounding 10,200 pixels
Saving Time with the Quick Selection Tool
We all never have enough time. Luckily, Adobe heard our cries and gave 
us a great tool. Think of it as a combo Brush, Magic Wand, Lasso tool. Easy 
to use — with surprisingly good results — it’s sure to become part of your 
selection arsenal.
To make short work of selecting by using this tool, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the Quick Selection tool from the Tools panel.
 
 The tool looks like a wand with a marquee around the end. It shares 
the Magic Wand tool’s flyout menu. You can also press the W key, then 
press Shift+W until you get the tool.
 
2. If you’re making a new selection, be sure that the selection option is 
set to New Selection or Add to Selection in the Options bar.
 
3. Select your desired brush settings from the Brush picker in the 
Options bar.
 
4. If your image has layers and you want to make a selection from all the 
layers, select the Sample All Layers option.
 
 If you leave this option unselected, you select only from the current 
layer.

5. Check the Auto-Enhance option to have Photoshop assist you by auto-
matically refining your selection by implementing an algorithm.
 
6. Click and drag over the desired 
areas of your image.
 
 Your selection grows while you 
drag, as shown in Figure 1-16.
 
 If you stop dragging and click in 
another portion of your image, 
your selection includes that 
clicked area.
 
7. Change your selection, as needed.
 
 You have three options to change 
your selection:
 
• To add to your selection, hold 
down the Shift key while drag-
ging across your desired image 
areas. (If the Add to Selection 
option is already selected in 
the Options bar, you don’t have 
to hold down the Shift key.)
 
• To delete from your selection, 
press the Alt (Option on the 
Mac) key while dragging across 
your unwanted image areas.
 
• You can also select the Add to Selection and Subtract from Selection 
options in the Options bar.
 
8. If you need to further fine-tune your selection, click the Refine Edges 
option in the Options bar.
 
 I explain settings in detail in the “Using the Marquee options” section, 
earlier in this chapter.

A
lthough the Marquee, Lasso, and Magic Wand tools are fun, friendly, 
and pretty easy to wield (see Book III, Chapter 1), sometimes they 
don’t quite have the horsepower to make that really precise selection. So, 
either you spend a lot of time cleaning up what you’ve selected (see Book III, 
Chapter 3 for more on that topic), or you live with 
a ho-hum selection. That’s where the Pen tool and 
its related cronies come to the rescue. The Pen 
tool creates paths — which you can then convert 
into selections.
Because the Pen tool (along with the related path-
editing tools) offers control and precision, it can 
nail that accurate selection. The only problem is 
that the Pen tool is a far cry from fun, friendly, and 
easy. Many new users try the Pen a few times but 
end up muttering in disgust and returning grate-
fully to the Lasso tool. However, I guarantee that 
if you dedicate a good chunk of time to mastering 
the Pen tool, you can turn your elite little nose up 
at the simple Lasso tool.
Introducing Paths
Unlike the other selection tools, the Pen tool doesn’t initially produce a 
selection marquee. When you select the Pen tool and start clicking and 
dragging around your image, you create a path. Paths have three types of 
components — anchor points, straight segments, and curved segments.

240
Introducing Paths
Curved paths are called Bézier paths 
(after Pierre Bézier — who, in the 
1970s, invented the equation used for 
CAD/CAM programs). They’re based 
on a mathematical cubic equation 
in which the path is controlled by 
direction lines that end in direction 
points (often referred to as handles), 
as shown in Figure 2-1. The length and 
angle of direction lines control the 
pitch and angle of the Bézier curve.
Figure 2-1 and the following list intro-
duce the different kinds of anchor 
points that Photoshop puts at your 
disposal and show you exactly what 
they do. You can use some or all of 
these anchor points in a single path:
 
✓ A true corner point: Has no direc-
tion lines. Use corner points when 
you’re selecting objects that have 
straight sides, such as stairs or 
barns.
 
✓ A smooth point: Has two direc-
tion lines pointing in opposite 
directions that are dependent on 
one another. Use smooth points 
when selecting objects that have 
alternating curves, such as a sea of rolling waves.
 
✓ A cusp point: Has two direction lines that are independent of one 
another. Use cusp points when you’re selecting an object that has 
curves going the same direction, such as the petals on a daisy.
 
✓ A point between a straight segment and a curve: A corner point that 
has only one direction line.
After you create a Bézier path, you can then edit the path by moving, 
adding, deleting, or converting anchor points and by manipulating 
the direction lines. You can also transform paths by choosing Edit➪
Transform Paths. When you transform a path, you can scale, rotate, skew, 
distort, change the perspective of, or warp the path (see Book III, Chapter 3 
for details).

Creating and 
Working with Paths
Creating a Path with the Pen Tool
The path hovers over the image in its own space. You control the path via 
the Paths panel, where you can save it, duplicate it, stroke it with color 
(apply color to the edge only), fill it with color or a pattern, and (most 
importantly) load it as a selection. I say “most importantly” because nine 
times out of ten, you painstakingly create a path as a means to an accurate 
selection marquee. You may use the path as a clipping path one other time: 
to hide a part of a layer or part of an entire image.
Creating a Path with the Pen Tool
The best way to get the hang of the Pen tool is to dive right in and work with 
it. Start with straight lines, which are very easy, and then move on to the 
more difficult curves. The more you practice with the Pen, the more com-
fortable and proficient you can become. It definitely is an example of the old 
adage, “You get out what you put into it.”
Knowing your Pen tool options
Although every path consists of three basic components — segments, 
points, and direction lines — the Pen tool enables you to use these com-
ponents to create a few different types of paths. See Book IV, Chapter 2 for 
more information on the following options, accessible from the Pen tool’s 
Options bar. You must choose one of the following:
 
✓ Shape Layers: This option creates a shape on a new layer that’s called, 
not surprisingly, a shape layer. After you create the path that defines the 
shape, Photoshop fills the shape with the foreground color and stores 
the path as a vector mask (see Book VI, Chapter 3) in the Paths panel. A 
shape layer is a unique entity.
 
✓ Paths: This option enables you to create a traditional path that hovers 
over the image. The path you create is a work path — which is tempo-
rary, appears in the Paths panel, and is unsaved. If you’re creating a 
path that you eventually want to load as a selection, this is your option.
 
✓ Fill Pixels: This option is available only when you’re using the shape 
tools. It allows you to create a shape and fill it with the foreground color, 
but it doesn’t create a shape layer, nor does it retain the path.
 
For a detailed explanation of vector (shape layers and paths) and raster 
images (such as those created with fill pixels), see Book II Chapter 1.
Creating your first work path
Making a work path is the easiest of the three options, and you’ll use it 
frequently after you get the hang of using the Pen tool. The following steps 
show you how to create a simple, straight path:

242
Creating a Path with the Pen Tool
 
1. Open an image you want to practice on.
 
 I suggest choosing an image that has an element with both straight 
edges and curves, if you want to also practice creating curved paths in 
the next few sections.
 
2. Select the Pen tool from the Tools panel.
 
 Or you can just press the P key.
 
3. On the Options bar, click the Paths button.
 
 You can see this button in Figure 2-2.

path type from the Options bar.

4. To create a straight line, click and release your mouse button at the 
points where you want the line to begin and to end, leaving anchor 
points at those positions.
 
 You don’t need to do any dragging to create straight segments. When 
you click and add your anchor points, Photoshop creates straight seg-
ments that connect the anchor points, as shown in Figure 2-3.
 
5. To draw a constrained line — horizontal, vertical, or 45-degree angle — 
hold down the Shift key while you click.

244
Creating a Path with the Pen Tool
 
6. To end the path, click the Pen tool in the Tools panel to deselect it.
 
 Or use this very handy shortcut:
 
a. Hold down the Ctrl key (Ô on the Mac).
 
 The Direct Selection tool (the white arrow) appears.
 
b. Click away from the line and release the Ctrl key (Ô on the Mac).
 
 The Pen tool reappears.
 
 With your path now deselected, you’re free to start another, uncon-
nected path, if you need to.
 
 Check out the following sections if you want to add other kinds of seg-
ments to the path. Otherwise, skip to the section “Closing a path,” later 
in this chapter.
Drawing curves
You’re probably never going to create a simple work path that doesn’t have 
curves as well as straight lines. I mean, not much in life is perfectly linear. 
Most things have undulations here and there. Picking up from the preceding 
section, follow these steps to create curved paths:
 
1. If you’re adding on to a previously created open path, be sure to posi-
tion your cursor on the last anchor point you created on that open 
path before you continue.
 
 A slash mark or a small square appears next to your cursor. If you’re 
starting a new path, position the cursor where the curve begins.
 
2. Whichever appears — the slash mark or the square — click and drag 
toward the direction you want the bump of the curve to go. Release 
the mouse button when you’re done.
 
 Here are some quick pointers for this stage of the procedure:
 
• If you’re creating a new path, an anchor point and two direction 
lines, which have direction points at their ends, appear. If you’re 
adding a curve to your straight segment, an anchor point and one 
direction line with one direction point appear. The direction lines 
and direction points control the angle and pitch of the curve.
 
• How do you know how far you should drag? Use the rule of thirds. 
Imagine that your curve is a piece of string that you’ve laid out in a 
straight line. Divide that line into thirds. Generally, the distance you 
drag your mouse cursor is approximately one-third the length of that 
line.
 
• How do you establish the angle? Drag straight from the anchor point 
for a steeper curve and at an angle from the anchor point for a flat-
ter curve. The element in my example is a flatter curve; therefore, 
I dragged up and to the right at an angle of just a few degrees, as 
shown in Figure 2-4.

245
Book III
Chapter 2
Creating and 
Working with Paths
Creating a Path with the Pen Tool
 
3. Move the cursor to the end of the 
curve and click and drag in the 
opposite direction, away from the 
bump.
 
 Another anchor point and a set 
of two direction lines and points 
appear. Photoshop creates the curve 
segment between the anchor points, 
as shown in Figure 2-5. Here are a 
couple of other handy pointers:
 
• If you drag both direction lines 
in the same direction, you 
create a curve shaped like an S.
 
• On the Options bar, click the 
down-pointing arrow at the end 
of the row of tools and choose 
the Rubber Band option. With 
this option selected, Photoshop 
draws a segment between the last anchor point you create and wher-
ever your cursor is located, giving you a kind of animated preview of 
how the path will appear. I personally find the option distracting, but 
some users love it.
 
4. To draw more alternating curves, just repeat these steps, dragging in 
an opposite direction each time.
Connecting a straight segment to a curve segment
If you need to create a straight segment after creating a curve (or vice 
versa), you need to convert the point where the path changes from curved 
to straight. To convert a point, follow these steps:
 
1. Position your cursor over the second anchor point in the existing 
curve and hold down the Alt key (Option on the Mac).
 
 A caret (which looks like an upside down V) appears next to the Pen 
cursor.
 
2. Click and release your mouse button over the anchor point. Also 
release the Alt key (Option on the Mac).
 
 The bottom direction line disappears. You’ve converted a smooth point 
into a corner point with one direction line. This action now allows you 
to create a straight segment.
 
 It’s no coincidence that the tool icon for the Convert Point tool is also a 
caret. Whenever you see a caret symbol in Photoshop, it’s an indication 
that you’re converting an anchor point, from smooth to corner or vice 
versa.

3. Move your mouse to the 
end of the straight edge 
that you want to select, 
and click and release.
 
 You can press the Shift 
key while you click if 
you want the line to be 
constrained horizontally, 
vertically, or at an angle 
that’s a multiple of 45 
degrees.
 
 Photoshop connects the 
two anchor points with a 
straight segment, as 
shown in Figure 2-6.
Connecting curve segments with cusp points
If you want to create a curve that goes in the same direction as a curve that’s 
adjacent to it, you have to take a couple additional steps, in addition to fol-
lowing the steps in “Drawing Curves”:

Book III
Chapter 2
Creating and 
Working with Paths
Creating a Path with the Pen Tool
 
1. Convert the point — this time 
from smooth to cusp — by posi-
tioning your cursor over the 
second anchor point in the exist-
ing curve and holding down the 
Alt (Option on the Mac) key.
 
2. Click and drag toward the bump 
of the curve. Release the mouse 
button and then release the Alt 
(Option on the Mac) key.
 
 Essentially, your actions are pull-
ing the direction line out from 
the anchor point. Both direction 
lines move to the same side of the 
anchor point, yet they’re indepen-
dent of each other, creating the 
cusp point, as shown in Figure 2-7.
 
3. Move your cursor to where you 
want the curve to end and drag away from the bump to create your 
second curve.
 
 Try to keep anchor points on either side of the curve, not along the top. 
Also, try to use the fewest number of anchor points possible to create 
your path. That way, the path results in a much smoother curve. It also 
can reduce the possibility of printing problems.
Closing a path
To close the path, return to your first anchor point and click. A small circle 
appears next to your Pen cursor, indicating that you’re closing the path 
when you click.
Congratulations! You’re now the proud owner of a work path (see Figure 2-8). 
Don’t worry if the path isn’t perfect; you can find out how to edit paths in the 
section “Editing Paths,” later in this chapter. If your path is perfect and you 
want to save it now, skip ahead to the section “Working with the Paths Panel,” 
later in this chapter.
 
If your path is incomplete and you want to continue drawing it, either click 
or click and drag the endpoint with the Pen tool. A slash mark or small 
square appears next to the Pen cursor.

that go in the same direction with a cusp 
point.

Figure 2-8: To close your work path, return to your first anchor point and click.
Creating subpaths
You can create a series of lines or curves. For example, you may want to 
create a border consisting of some decorative curve shapes, which you 
could later stroke with color (see Book IV, Chapter 2). You can then save 
these subpaths under a single path name. To create a series of subpaths, 
simply end one path before starting another. Make sure that the paths aren’t 
hidden when you do so; otherwise, Photoshop eliminates the previous path 
when you start another.
Working with the Paths Panel
Working hand in hand with the Pen tool is the Paths panel. You can think of 
it as a kind of Command and Control Center for your paths. Although it isn’t 
mandatory, opening up your Paths panel (shown in Figure 2-9) is a good idea 
before you create a path so that you can stay apprised of what’s happening 
with your image. To open the panel, choose Window➪Paths.
The icons at the bottom of the Paths panel, from left to right (as shown in 
Figure 2-9), are
 
✓ Fill Path with foreground color
 
✓ Stroke Path with brush

Creating and 
Working with Paths
Working with the Paths Panel
 
✓ Load Path as Selection
 
✓ Make Work Path from Selection
 
✓ Create New Path
 
✓ Delete Current Path
The following sections highlight some 
of the stuff you can do with the Paths 
panel.
Creating a path
When you create a path, it automati-
cally appears in the Paths panel as a 
work path.
 
A work path is temporary and unsaved, 
and you can have only one work path in the Paths panel at a time.
If the work path is selected when you begin another path, your actions are 
added to the current work path. But if the existing work path is hidden and 
you begin drawing another path, that new work path replaces the existing one.
Creating a new path
 
 You can save yourself a lot of grief if you make sure that your path is saved 
before you start creating it. If you select New Path from the Paths panel 
pop-up menu before you create the path, Photoshop automatically saves the 
work path, and it becomes a saved path (also called a named path). You can 
also just click the Create New Path icon at the bottom of the Paths panel.
Saving a work path
To save a work path, double-click the path in the Paths panel. Or choose 
Save Path from the Paths panel pop-up menu (click the down-pointing trian-
gle in the upper-right of the panel to open the menu). Then, provide a name 
in the Save Path dialog box that appears and click OK.
After you save your path, you can reload it at any time. Unlike layers, paths 
take up very little storage space, so don’t hesitate to save them. Plus, you 
don’t want to go through all that work again if you don’t have to. Unlike work 
paths, you can have as many saved paths as your heart desires.
Deleting, duplicating, and renaming a path
 
 To delete a path, drag the path to the trash can icon at the bottom of the 
panel. Or choose Delete Path from the Paths panel pop-up menu.
Figure 2-9: The Paths panel allows you 
to save, delete, stroke, fill, and make 
selections from your paths.

250
Working with the Paths Panel
 
 You can duplicate a saved path by selecting the path in the Paths panel and 
selecting Duplicate Path from the Paths panel pop-up menu. You can also 
drag the saved path on top of the Create New Path icon at the bottom of the 
panel.
To rename a path, double-click the path name in the Paths panel. Then, 
enter the new name directly within the panel.
Stroking a path
You can use the Stroke Path command to paint a stroke along the path. You 
can select which painting or editing tool to use to stroke the path. Follow 
these steps:
 
1. Select the path in the Paths panel. Then, select Stroke Path from the 
Paths panel pop-up menu.
 
 Or hold down the Alt (Option on the Mac) key and click the Stroke path 
that has the brush icon (an outlined circle) at the bottom of the panel.
 
 
 You can also click the Stroke Path icon without holding down the Alt 
(Option on the Mac) key. This option bypasses the dialog box in Step 2 
and just strokes your path with whatever setting you used previously.
 
2. In the dialog box that opens, select one of the many painting or edit-
ing tools that you want to use to apply color to the stroke. Click OK.
 
 Make sure that you verify your chosen tool’s settings on the Options bar 
because Photoshop uses those settings to stroke your path. Photoshop 
also applies your current foreground color to the stroke.
 
 If you’re using a pressure-sensitive 
drawing tablet, you can select the 
Simulate Pressure check box to 
create strokes that have varying 
widths. If everything has gone well, 
you end up with a stroked path like 
the one shown in Figure 2-10.
 
 If you select one or more paths by 
using the Direct Selection tool (the 
white arrow in the Tools panel), 
the Stroke Path command changes 
to Stroke Subpath(s), enabling you 
to stroke only the selected paths.
 
Although paths themselves live in their 
own space, independent of layers, and don’t print, after you stroke or fill 
them, they do become part of your image layer and will print. Make sure the 
layer that’s currently active is the one you want your stroked or filled path 
to appear on before you perform the operation.

Filling a path
You can fill the interior of a path with color by choosing the Fill Path com-
mand. Follow these steps:
 
1. Select the path in the Paths panel and select Fill Path from the Paths 
panel pop-up menu.
 
 A dialog box gives options for Contents, Opacity, Blending, and Rendering. 
Briefly, for your Contents, choose between colors, pattern, or history. 
(For more on the Contents and Opacity options, see Book IV, Chapter 2.)
 
 
 Or you can hold down the Alt (Option on the Mac) key and click the Fill 
Path with Foreground Color icon (a solid circle) at the bottom of the 
panel. You can also click the Fill icon without holding down the Alt 
(Option on the Mac) key which fills the path with the foreground color 
and the other settings at the default. 
 
2. In the dialog box, leave the Blending Mode option set to Normal.
 
 Using the Layers panel to apply your blend modes is better because you 
have more flexibility (see Book V for more on layers). Here’s the scoop 
on the remaining options:
 
• The feathering option gradually blurs the edges of the fill into the 
background. Enter the Feather Radius in pixels. The more pixels, the 
greater the blur or feather.
 
• The anti-alias option just 
slightly softens the very edge 
of the fill by one pixel so the 
edges don’t appear as ragged.
 
 If you select one or more paths 
by using the Direct Selection tool, 
the Fill Path command changes to 
Fill Subpath(s), enabling you to fill 
only the selected paths.
 
3. After you set your options, 
click OK.
 
 Your path now is filled — similar to 
mine, which is shown in Figure 2-11.
Loading Paths as Selections
Creating a path is usually the means to an end — an accurate selection. 
Therefore, you frequently use the Paths panel to load your path as a selection.
Follow these steps to get the lowdown on how to do just that. Open an 
image, make a selection by using the Pen tool, and get started:
Corbis Digital Stock
Figure 2-11: If stroking your path with color 
isn’t enough, you can fill it instead.

252
Loading Paths as Selections
 
1. Select Make Selection from the Paths panel pop-up menu.
 
 Alternatively, you can also hold down Alt (Option on the Mac) and click 
the Load Path as Selection icon in the Paths panel.
 
 
 To bypass the Make Selection dialog box, simply click the Load path as 
Selection icon at the bottom of the Paths panel without holding down 
the Alt (Option on the Mac) key.
 
2. Feather or anti-alias your selection in the Make Selection dialog box.
 
 You have these options:
 
• Feather your selection by entering a pixel value in the Feather Radius 
box. (For more on feathering, see Book III, Chapter 3.)
 
• Leave the feather radius at 0 for a hard-edged selection.
 
• My personal recommendation: Select the Anti-Aliased option. This 
option slightly softens the edge of the selection by one pixel so that 
it doesn’t appear so jagged.
 
• If you have no other selections active, the Operation option will 
default to New Selection. If you happen to have another selection 
active when you load your current path as a selection, you can 
choose to add, subtract, or intersect with that other selection. 
 
 After the path is made into a selection (as shown in Figure 2-12), it acts 
like any other selection.

Turning a Selection into a Path
If you need a selection refresher, see Book III, Chapter 1. If you want to save 
your selection (saving a selection creates an alpha channel), jump ahead to 
Book VI, Chapter 1, where I explain details on working with channels.
 
Here’s one of my favorite shortcuts: To quickly load the path as a selection, 
select the path and then press Ctrl+Enter (Ô+Return on the Mac). You can 
also Ctrl-click (Ô-click on the Mac) your path name in the Paths panel to do 
the same. Just be aware that you bypass the Make Selection dialog box and 
its options when you use the shortcuts.
Turning a Selection into a Path
Although you probably won’t use this option nearly as often as you use the 
option to turn a path into a selection, the option is, indeed, available: You 
can create paths from existing selections.
Creating a path from a selection can come in handy if you need to save a 
path as a clipping path (because areas of the image outside the path are 
hidden). To create a path from a selection, follow these steps:
 
1. If you’ve been reading from the beginning of this chapter, you prob-
ably have a selection on-screen ready and raring to go. If you’re just 
now jumping in, select the desired element in your image.
 
2. With the selection marquee active, select Make Work Path from the 
Paths panel pop-up menu.
 
 
 You can also create a path from a selection by holding down Alt (Option 
on the Mac) and clicking the Make Work Path from Selection icon in the 
Paths panel. If you just click the icon without holding down Alt (Option 
on the Mac), you also make a path, but you bypass the dialog box.
 
3. In the dialog box that appears, enter a Tolerance value.
 
 The Tolerance value controls how sensitive Photoshop is to the nooks 
and crannies in the selection when it creates the path:
 
• The lower the value, the more sensitive it is, and the more closely 
the selection follows your path.
 
• Too low a value, such as 0.5, may create too many anchor points.
 
• Too high a value, such as 10 (the max), rounds out your path too 
much. Start with the default setting of 2.0.
 
 You can always tweak the path later (check out the section “Editing 
Paths,” later in this chapter).
 
4. If the path is still showing, simply click in the gray area below the 
path names in the Paths panel.
 
 This action deselects the path.

5. Select the work path in the Paths panel and select Save Path from the 
Paths panel pop-up menu. Name the path and click OK.
Using the Kinder Freeform Pen
Confession: There’s a more amicable incarnation of the Pen tool — the 
Freeform Pen tool. This tool is kind of a hybrid Lasso/Pen tool. Just click and 
drag around the element you want to select, and the tool creates an outline 
that follows your cursor, exactly like the Lasso.
After you release your mouse button, Photoshop provides the anchor 
points, lines, and curves for that path. In this way, the Freeform Pen works 
exactly like the Pen.
In my humble opinion, the Freeform Pen rates just an okay. The downside is 
that you’re back to needing a really steady hand in order to get an accurate 
selection. The Freeform Pen tool’s probably one notch better than the Lasso 
tool because you do get a path that you can refine before you load it as a 
selection. But I’d rather pay my dues and get skilled with the regular Pen.
Here are some Freeform Pen tips:
 
✓ To create straight segments by using the Freeform Pen, hold down Alt 
(Option on the Mac) while pressing the mouse button and then click to 
create the anchor point.
 
✓ Holding down Alt (Option on the Mac) temporarily turns the Freeform 
Pen into the regular Pen. When you want to return to using the Freeform 
Pen, release Alt (Option on the Mac), keeping the mouse button clicked.
 
Be careful: If you release Alt (Option on the Mac) after releasing the mouse 
button, Photoshop ends your path, and you can do nothing about it.
The following sections give you the scoop on the options, which you can 
find by clicking the down-pointing arrow on the Options bar, that go hand in 
hand with the Freeform Pen tool (see Figure 2-13).
Figure 2-13: The Freeform Pen is a cross between the Lasso and 
the Pen tools, and it requires a steady hand to create paths.

Curve Fit
The Curve Fit option lets you adjust the amount of error Photoshop allows 
when trying to fit your cursor movement to a path. You can enter a value 
from 0.5 to 10 pixels; the default setting is 2 pixels.
At the default setting, Photoshop doesn’t register any movement of your 
cursor that’s 2 pixels or less. Setting the value to 0.5 pixels makes the 
Freeform Pen very sensitive to your movement and forces the tool to very 
closely follow the edge.
The disadvantage of this option is that using it also causes a lot of unneces-
sary anchor points. Although a value of 10 pixels corrects this problem by 
making the option less sensitive, your path may not be as accurate if you 
back off on the sensitivity.
 
I recommend trying the Freeform Pen at each of these settings and then get-
ting a feel for the kind of path it makes.
Magnetic
When selected, the Magnetic option makes the Freeform Pen act much like 
the Magnetic Lasso tool (see Book III, Chapter 1). Click anywhere on the 
edge of the element you want to select. Release your mouse button and then 
move the cursor around the edge. The tool snaps to the edge of your ele-
ment, creating anchor points and segments. You can
 
✓ Manually control the magnetism. If the Freeform Pen tool starts to veer 
off course, you can force an anchor point down manually by clicking. 
To delete the most recent anchor point, press Backspace (delete on 
the Mac).
 
✓ Create straight segments. To create straight segments, Alt-click (Option-
click on the Mac) to temporarily get the regular Pen. Alt-drag (Option-
drag on the Mac) to temporarily access the regular Freeform Pen. To 
return to the Magnetic Freeform Pen tool, release Alt (Option on the 
Mac), click again, and continue moving the cursor.
To close a path by using the magnetic Freeform Pen, double-click or return 
to your starting anchor point.
Width, Contrast, Frequency, and Pen Pressure
The Width, Contrast, and Frequency settings are specifically for the 
Magnetic option and work just like the Magnetic Lasso options. Width speci-
fies how close to the edge (1–256) the tool must be before it detects an edge. 
Contrast (1–100) specifies how much contrast must be between pixels for 
the tool to see the edge. And Frequency (0–100) specifies the rate at which the 
tool lays down anchor points. For more details, see Book III, Chapter 1.

Creating Paths without the Pen
The Pen Pressure option is available only if you’re using a pressure-sensitive 
drawing tablet. It allows you to adjust how sensitive the tool is based on how 
hard you press down with the stylus.
Creating Paths without the Pen
I want to let you in on a fun way to create paths. Yes, I said fun. (You have to 
assume that by fun, I mean no Pen tool is involved in the method.)
You can grab any of the shape tools and create a work path. Before you do, 
however, be sure to click the Paths icon on the Options bar. It’s the icon 
that looks like a Pen cursor with a square path around it. Click and drag the 
shape tool of choice onto your canvas and presto, an instant path. These 
shapes can come in handy for creating small spot illustrations, logos, and 
Web buttons.
Follow these steps:
 
1. Open an existing image and select a shape tool.
 
 In the example shown in Figure 2-14, I used the Custom Shape tool.For 
details on the shape tools and their options, see Book IV, Chapter 1.

2. Choose a shape from the shape preset library on the Options bar.
 
 I chose a fish shape for my example.
 
3. Choose the Paths option in the Options bar. Using the Shape tool, click 
and drag a path in your image window. Press the Shift key while drag-
ging to constrain the shape’s proportions.
 
 You can then use the Paths panel to load the path as a selection. (See 
the section “Loading Paths as Selections,” earlier in this chapter.)
 
4. Choose Layer➪New➪Layer via Copy.
 
 You’ve just put the selection on its own layer. You can hide your original 
background image by clicking the eyeball icon in the Layers panel. For 
more on layers, see Book V.
 
5. If you want, add some type with the Type tool.
 
 Then, you can jazz it up — like this, for example:
 
• If you want to give your type some motion, click the Create Warped 
Text button on the Options bar. You can also apply drop shadows, 
bevels, and other effects by choosing Layer➪Layer Style.
 
• For my example, I chose the 
Arc style warp in the Warp Text 
dialog box.
 
• I also applied a Bevel and 
Emboss and Drop Shadow 
Layer Style to both the selec-
tion and the type. (For more 
on type, see Book IV, Chapter 
3.)
 
6. Delete the original image layer.
 
 When I was done, the image in 
Figure 2-15 was what I ended up 
with — fun and very easy.
Editing Paths
Often, it’s easier and less time consuming to try to get a reasonably decent, 
but not perfect, path by using the Pen tool. Then, after you have that path, 
go back and edit it for more accuracy. And although following the Eyeball-
It-Then-Fix-It strategy is valuable at any time in your Photoshop career, it’s 
especially true when you’re first figuring out how to use the Pen tool.
Photoshop offers you a bevy of editing tools that can make your path repair a 
snap. These tools even share the Pen tool’s flyout menu. In addition, the arrow 
tools, which Adobe calls the Path Selection and Direct Selection tools, are also

a few effects, you have a fun composite

Editing Paths
extremely helpful when it comes to fine-
tuning your path. In fact, you may find 
(as I do) that the Direct Selection tool is 
one of your favorite tools — so simple 
to use, yet so functional. Figure 2-16 
shows both sets of tools.
To edit a path, follow these steps:
 
1. If you can’t see the path you want 
to edit, select the path in the 
Paths panel.
 
 This selection activates the path.
 
2. To see the individual anchor 
points so that you can edit them, 
select the Direct Selection tool 
(remember, it’s the white arrow). 
Click anywhere along the path.
 
 You now see the individual 
anchor points and segments that 
comprise the path. Most of the 
anchor points, if not all, are hollow 
because they’re unselected, as 
shown in Figure 2-17.
 
3. If you need to move an anchor 
point, click it with the Direct 
Selection tool.
 
 When selected, the point becomes 
solid, also shown in Figure 2-17.
 
4. Drag to move the anchor point.
 
 If you need to, you can move a 
curved or straight segment in the 
same fashion.
 
5. If you need to move an entire 
path, use the Path Selection tool 
(the black arrow).
 
 You can also select multiple paths 
by holding down the Shift key while 
clicking the paths.
 
 If you move any part of the path 
beyond the boundary of the image 
canvas, it’s still available — just 
Figure 2-16: The compadres of the Pen tool 
help to refine your paths to perfection.

not visible. Use the Zoom tool to zoom out until you see the hidden 
portion of the path.
 
6. Using the Direct selection tool, manipulate the direction lines to 
change the shape of the curve. First, click the anchor point of the 
curve to select it. Then, click and drag the direction point going the 
same direction as the bump.
 
 By lengthening or shortening the direction line, you can control how 
steep or flat the curve is. By rotating the direction line, you change the 
slope of the curve, as shown in Figure 2-18. Here are a few more editing 
pointers:
 
• To add an anchor point in your path: Use the Add Anchor Point 
tool. Click in the path where you need an anchor point. This tool 
always adds a smooth point, no matter where you click.
 
• To delete an anchor point: Select the Delete Anchor Point tool, posi-
tion the cursor over the anchor point, and click it. The anchor point 
disappears, while you keep your path intact.
 
• To convert an anchor point from smooth to corner or vice versa: 
Select the Convert Point tool. Position your cursor over your desired 
anchor point. If the anchor point is a corner point, drag away from 
the anchor point to create the direction lines that create a smooth 
point. If the point is a smooth point, simply click and release the 
anchor point to convert it into a corner point. To convert a smooth 
point to a cusp point, make sure the direction lines are showing and 
then drag a direction line to break it into independent direction lines. 
And finally, to convert a cusp point back to a smooth point, just drag 
out from the anchor point.

Using the Options Bar
 
• To copy a path: First, select the path by using the Path Selection 
tool. Then, hold down Alt (Option on the Mac) and drag away from 
the path. While you drag, you carry a copied path with you.
 
• To delete a path: Select the path by using the Path Selection tool and 
press the Backspace key (Delete key on the Mac). You can also select 
a point on the path by using the Direct Selection tool and press 
Backspace (Delete on the Mac) twice.
Using the Options Bar
Quite a few options appear on the Options bar when the Pen tool or Path 
Selection/Direct Selection tools are active. Here’s the scoop on those options:
 
✓ Auto Add/Delete: Enables you to add or delete an anchor point by using 
the regular Pen tool.
 
✓ Show Bounding Box: Places a box around the path, allowing you to 
transform the path. The bounding box isn’t a path or part of your image. 
It’s merely a visual guide to assist you in transformations. For more on 
transformations, see Book III, Chapter 3.
 
✓ Path state buttons (Add, Subtract, Intersect, and Exclude): Combine all 
visible paths by adding, subtracting, intersecting, or excluding paths. 
Click your desired button to direct Photoshop on how to control the 
overlapping portions of the path(s) when you convert it to a selection. 
For example, clicking the Add button selects all areas, whether or not 
they overlap. Clicking Intersect selects only the overlapping areas.
 
✓ Combine button: Allows you to group paths together as a single unit. 
Select your desired paths and click the Combine button. When you 
select any one of the paths, all the paths within the group are selected.
 
✓ Align and Distribute buttons: Align two or more paths, and distribute 
three or more paths. The icons give you a good visual cue as to how the 
alignment or distribution will appear.

f you’re like me, you may find it tough to get the perfect selection the 
first time around. I mean, all you need is one too many cups of coffee, 
and that Lasso tool seems to take on a mind of its own. That’s 
okay. Photoshop is way too benevolent to leave you hanging 
with a mediocre selection. A multitude of techniques are 
available to modify and transform your selections. You 
can add or remove pixels from your selection, scale 
your selection outline, smooth out jagged edges, or 
switch what’s selected for what isn’t. Knowing how 
to clean up and modify your selections helps you to 
nail your desired element with precision.
If you haven’t already thumbed through the first two 
chapters of Book III and gotten a good grasp of how 
to create selections by using the mighty Photoshop 
Tools panel, go ahead and browse those chapters now.
Achieving Selection Perfection
Although the selection tools, such as the Lasso, Quick Selection, and Magic 
Wand tools, usually do a pretty fair job of capturing the bulk of your selection, 
making a really accurate selection often requires another sort of tool — 
concentration. Give your selections a little extra attention, and you’ll be 
amazed by the results. By adding and subtracting from the outline here and 
there, you can refine a selection and ensure that you capture only what you 
really want — and nothing that you don’t.

262
Achieving Selection Perfection
The following sections show you how to use keyboard shortcuts, along 
with your mouse, to make perfect selections. If you’re not one for keyboard 
shortcuts, you can use the four selection option buttons on the Options bar 
to create a new selection, add to a selection, subtract from a selection, or 
intersect one selection with another. You just need to grab the selection tool 
of your choice, click the selection option button you want, and drag (or click 
if you’re using the Magic Wand or Polygon Lasso tool).
 
When adding to a selection, a small plus sign (+) appears next to your 
cursor. When subtracting from a selection, a small minus sign (–) appears. 
When intersecting two selections, a small multiplication sign (×) appears.
Adding to a selection
If your selection doesn’t quite contain all the elements you want to capture, 
you need to add those portions to your current selection.
For you keyboarders, to add to a current selection, simply hold down the 
Shift key and drag around the pixels you want to include when using the reg-
ular Lasso or the Rectangular or Elliptical Marquee tool. You can also hold 
down the Shift key and click the area you want when using the Magic Wand 
tool, or drag the area you want when using the Quick Selection tool.
To include an area that has straight sides in your selection, you can hold 
down the Shift key and click around the area when using the Polygon Lasso 
tool. And although you may not have much need to do it, you can also hold 
down the Shift key and click when using the Single Column or Single Row 
Marquee tool. I wouldn’t use the Magnetic Lasso tool to add to a selection; 
it’s way too cumbersome.
 
You don’t have to use the same tool to add to your selection that you used 
to create the original selection. Feel free to use whatever selection tool you 
think can get the job done. (See Book III, Chapters 1 and 2 for details on 
selection tools and methods.)
Follow these steps to add to the circular selection, such as the one shown in 
Figure 3-1:
 
1. Make your first elliptical selection by selecting the larger circle with 
the Elliptical Marquee tool.
 
 Be sure you hold down the Alt key (Option on the Mac) to draw from the 
center out. See the left image in Figure 3-1.
 
2. To add the smaller circular area you will need to hold down two keys. 
First hold down the Shift key to add to the selection, and then hold 
down the Alt key (Option on the Mac) to draw from the center out. 
Note that you must press and hold down the keys in this order.

3. Drag around the smaller selection by using the Elliptical Marquee tool.
 
 The resulting selection is shown in the example on the right in Figure 3-1.
Figure 3-1: The original selection appears on the left, and the selection after adding is 
on the right.
Subtracting from a selection
Just like you can add to a selection marquee, you can also subtract from, or 
take a chunk out of, a selection. Here’s how to subtract from a current selec-
tion using the following tools: 
 
✓ The regular Lasso or the Rectangular or Elliptical Marquee tool: Hold 
down the Alt (Option on the Mac) key and drag around the pixels you 
want to subtract.
 
✓ The Magic Wand and Quick Selection tools: Hold down the Alt (Option 
on the Mac) key and click the area you want to remove.
 
✓ The Polygon Lasso tool: To subtract a straight-sided area, hold down 
the Alt (Option on the Mac) key and click around the area.
 
✓ The Single Column or Single Row Marquee tool: You can hold down 
the Alt (Option on the Mac) key and click. The Single Column and Single 
Row Marquee tools come in handy when you want to get rid of just the 
very edge of a selection.
In Figure 3-2, I first selected the outside of the frame by using the Polygon 
Lasso tool. I didn’t use the obvious tool of choice — the Rectangular 

264
Getting the Keys to Behave
Marquee tool — because the frame 
wasn’t completely straight. To deselect 
the inside of the frame from the selec-
tion, I held down the Alt (Option on the 
Mac) key and clicked at each corner of 
the inside of the frame when using the 
Polygon Lasso tool, resulting in selec-
tion shown in Figure 3-2.
Intersecting two selections
What happens when you hold down 
the Shift and Alt (Option on the Mac) 
keys together? Not a collision, but 
an intersection. Holding down both 
keys while dragging with the Lasso 
or Marquee tool, or clicking with the 
Magic Wand tool, creates the intersection of the original selection with the 
second selection.
 
To retain only the part of an image where two selections overlap, hold down 
Shift+Alt (Shift+Option on the Mac) and then drag.
You can select a portion of an image by using a tool such as the Polygonal 
Lasso tool. Then, hold down Shift+Alt (Shift+Option on the Mac) and drag 
by using the Rectangular Marquee tool. The resulting intersection of the two 
selections appears.
Getting the Keys to Behave
Photoshop has a little glitch in its way of doing things. Well, not so much of a 
glitch as a conflict. With so many ways of doing things, somewhere along the 
line, you may have to jigger with Photoshop to get it to do what you want. 
For example, how does Photoshop know whether you want to create a per-
fect square or add to a selection when you press the Shift key?
Let me lay this out for you:
 
✓ When you make an initial selection with the Rectangular or Elliptical 
Marquee tool, holding down the Shift key constrains the proportions 
of the selection, thereby allowing you to create a perfect square or a 
perfect circle.
 
✓ If you hold down Alt (Option on the Mac) when using either of these 
tools, you can draw from the center out.
 
✓ If you hold down Alt (Option on the Mac) when using the Lasso tool, the 
Lasso temporarily becomes the Polygonal Lasso tool.

Unfortunately, despite numerous requests, the ability to read users’ minds 
wasn’t a Photoshop Version CS4 upgrade feature. The following steps show 
you what you have to do to get Photoshop to recognize your wishes.
To add a perfectly square or round selection to an existing selection, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Hold down Shift and drag when using the Rectangular or Elliptical 
Marquee tool.
 
 Your selection is unconstrained.
 
2. While you drag, keeping your mouse button pressed, release the Shift 
key for just a moment, and then press and hold it again.
 
 Your unconstrained selection suddenly snaps into a constrained square 
or circle.
 
3. Release the mouse button before you release the Shift key.
 
 If you don’t release the mouse button before you release the Shift key, 
the selection shape reverts to its unconstrained form.
To delete part of a selection while drawing from the center out, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Hold down Alt (Option on the 
Mac) and drag when using the 
Rectangular or Elliptical Marquee 
tool.
 
2. While you drag, keeping your 
mouse button pressed, release the 
Alt (Option on the Mac) key for just 
a moment, and then press and hold 
it again.
 
 You’re now drawing from the center 
outward.
 
3. Release the mouse button before 
you release the Alt (Option on the 
Mac) key.
 
 See Figure 3-3.
 
Use the preceding steps when you’re selecting a doughnut, tire, inflatable 
swim ring, and other circular items that have holes in the middle.

Using the Select Menu
Using the Select Menu
Although you can add, subtract, and intersect selections by using the Shift 
and Alt (Option on the Mac) keys and the selection option buttons on the 
Options bar, you can do much more with the commands on the Select menu. 
In this menu, you can find ways to expand, contract, smooth, and fuzz your 
selection, and even turn your selection inside out. You can also use this 
menu to automatically select similar colors and create selection borders. 
And I show you how to do all this in the following sections. With this kind of 
knowledge, imperfect selections will soon be a thing of the past.
Selecting all or nothing
The Select All and Deselect commands are pretty self-explanatory. To select 
everything in your image, choose Select➪All. To deselect everything, choose 
Select➪Deselect. The key commands Ctrl+A (Ô+A on the Mac) and Ctrl+D 
(Ô+D on the Mac), respectively, come in very handy and are easy to 
remember.
 
In most cases, you don’t have to select everything in your image. If you don’t 
have an active selection marquee, Photoshop naturally assumes that you 
want to apply whatever command you execute to the entire image.
Reselecting a selection
If you’ve taken 20 minutes to carefully lasso a spiny sea anemone from its ocean 
home, the last thing you want is to lose your coveted selection marquee. But 
that’s exactly what happens if you accidentally click the canvas when you have 
an active selection tool in hand. The selection marquee disappears.
Sure, you can choose Edit➪Undo if you catch your mistake right away. And 
technically, you can access the History panel to recover your selection (see 
Book II, Chapter 4 for more on history). A much easier solution is to choose 
Select➪Reselect. This command retrieves your last selection.
Besides immediately bringing back a selection you accidentally deselected, the 
Reselect command can come in handy if you decide to select an element again 
for a second time. For example, if you do such a great job retouching your 
spiny anemone that you decide to add, by cloning, another anemone to your 
image, go ahead. It’s all up to you. By using the Reselect command, you can 
easily load the selection again, rather than start the selection from scratch.
 
The Reselect command works for only the last selection you made, so don’t 
plan to reselect a selection you made last week — or even ten minutes ago — 
if you’ve selected something else in the meantime.

Using the Select Menu
Swapping a selection
 
Sometimes, selecting what you don’t 
want is easier than selecting what you 
do want. For example, if you’re trying 
to select your pet dog, photographed 
against a neutral background, why 
spend valuable time meticulously 
selecting him with the Pen or Lasso 
tool, when you can just click the back-
ground with the Magic Wand tool? 
(Don’t forget to use the Shift key to 
select bits of background you might 
have missed the first time.)
After you select the background, just 
choose Select➪Inverse. Presto, you 
now have Fido the Retriever selected 
and obediently awaiting your next 
command, as shown in Figure 3-4.
Feathering a selection
In Book III, Chapter 1, I described 
how to feather (blur the edges of) a 
selection when using the Lasso and 
Marquee tools by entering a value in 
the Feather box on the Options bar. 
This method of feathering requires 
that you set your Feather radius before 
you create your selection.
Unfortunately, using this method, a 
problem arises if you want to modify 
the initial selection. When you make 
a selection with a feather, the mar-
quee outline of the selection adjusts 
to take into account the amount of 
the feather. So, the resulting marquee 
outline doesn’t resemble your precise 
mouse movement. As a result, modify-
ing, adding, or subtracting from your 
original selection is pretty tough.
 
A much better way to feather a selec-
tion is to make your initial selection 
without a feather, as shown in the 
top image of Figure 3-5. Clean up 
Figure 3-4: Sometimes, you want to select 
what you don’t want and then inverse your 
selection.
Corbis Digital Stock
Figure 3-5: You can more easily clean up 
your selection prior to applying a feather.

268
Using the Select Menu
your selection as you need to, and then apply your feather by choosing 
Select➪Modify➪Feather. In the dialog box, enter a Feather Radius value and 
click OK. The resulting selection appears in the bottom image of Figure 3-5.
 
The radius is how far out in all directions the feather extends. A radius of 
8 means the feather extends 8 pixels outward from the selection outline. A 
large feather radius makes the image appear to fade out.
Using the other Modify commands
In addition to the Feather command, the Select Modify menu contains a 
group of other modification commands that are lumped categorically. With 
the exception of the Contract command, you probably won’t use these 
options every day. But when you do use them, you’ll find they prove pretty 
handy. Here’s the lowdown on each command:
 
✓ Border: This command selects the area around the edge of the selection 
marquee. You specify the width of the area, from 1 to 200 pixels, and you 
get a border marquee. Select a foreground color, choose Edit➪Fill, pick 
Foreground Color from the Use drop-down list, and then click OK to fill 
your border with color. (By the way, you can also achieve a similar look 
by choosing Edit➪Stroke. See Book IV, Chapter 2 for details.)
 
✓ Smooth: If your selection marquee seems a bit ragged around the edges, 
try selecting the Smooth command to round off the nooks and crannies. 
Enter a sample radius value from 1 to 100 pixels. Photoshop examines 
each selected pixel and then includes or de-selects pixels in your selec-
tion based on the range specified by the radius amount. If most of the 
pixels are selected, Photoshop includes the strays; if most of the pixels 
are unselected, Photoshop removes the pixels. Start with 2 pixels — and 
if that doesn’t seem like enough, increase it by a few more pixels or so.
 
 Use this command with great caution. It’s just too easy to get mushy, ill-
defined selections.
 
✓ Expand: This command allows you to increase the size of your selection 
by a specified number of pixels, from 1 to 100. This command can come 
in handy if you just missed the edge of a circular selection and want to 
enlarge it, as shown in Figure 3-6.
 
✓ Contract: To shrink your selection by 1 to 100 pixels, choose Contract. I 
use this command a lot, in conjunction with the Feather command, when 
compositing multiple images.

Applying the Grow and Similar commands
The Grow and Similar commands are close cousins to the Magic Wand tool. 
(For more on the Wand and Tolerance, check out Book III, Chapter 1.) If 
you’re familiar with the modus operandi of the Magic Wand tool, you know 
that you rarely get the perfect selection on the first click. That’s because 
you’re making an intelligent guess about what Tolerance setting can pick up 
the pixels you want.
The Grow command compensates a little for the Magic Wand tool’s inac-
curacy. For example, if you need to include more in your selection, you can 
increase the Tolerance setting and try again — hold down Shift and click the 
area you need to include. Or you can choose Select➪Grow. The Grow 
Deleting a straight-sided selection
If you have an existing selection, holding down 
Alt (Option on the Mac) when using the Lasso 
tool subtracts from the selection. If you want 
to subtract a straight-sided selection from 
an existing selection, you can hold down Alt 
(Option on the Mac) and begin to drag. Then, 
release Alt (Option on the Mac) and select the 
Polygonal Lasso tool. But this process can be 
tricky and is really unnecessary. I recommend 
just grabbing the Polygonal Lasso tool itself to 
delete your straight-sided selection. Ditto for 
adding and getting intersections with straight-
sided selections.

270
Moving and Cloning Selections
command increases the size of the selection by including adjacent pixels 
that fall within the range of Tolerance.
The Similar command is like Grow, only the pixels don’t have to be adjacent 
to be selected. The command searches throughout the image and picks up 
pixels within the Tolerance range, wherever they may fall.
 
Both commands use the Tolerance value that’s displayed on the Options 
bar when you have the Magic Wand tool selected. Adjust the Tolerance set-
ting to include more or fewer colors by increasing or decreasing the setting, 
respectively.
The Refine Edge command helps to fine tune your selection. Find out the 
details in Book III, Chapter 1.
Moving and Cloning Selections
When you have your selection refined 
to ultimate perfection, you may then 
want to move it or clone it. To move a 
selection, simply grab the Move tool 
(the four-headed arrow) at the top-
right of the Tools panel, and then drag 
the selection.
Sounds easy enough, right? When 
you move the selection, however, be 
warned that the area where the selec-
tion used to reside is now filled with 
the background color, as shown in 
Figure 3-7. The background appears, of 
course, only if you’re moving both the 
selection outline and the image pixels. 
You can move just the selection outline 
(without the pixels), as I explain in the 
section “Moving the selection outline, 
but not the pixels,” later in this chap-
ter. Also, if you’re moving a selection 
on a layer, you’re left with transparent 
pixels. When you use the Move tool, 
your cursor icon changes to a pair of 
scissors, letting you know that you’re 
cutting out the selection.

using the Move tool, you leave a hole that 
reveals the background color.

Transforming Pixels
The Move tool has a couple of notable options residing in the Options bar:
 
✓ Auto-Select Layer: Select the topmost layer directly under the Move tool 
cursor, not necessarily the selected area.
 
✓ Auto-Select Group: Select the entire layer group that the selected layer 
belongs to.
 
✓ Show Transform Controls: Shows handles on the bounding box of your 
selected area.
Cloning
If the idea of leaving a big hole in your 
image doesn’t appeal to you, you can 
copy and move the selection, leaving 
the original image intact, as shown in 
Figure 3-8. Just hold down Alt (Option 
on the Mac) and drag when using the 
Move tool. This action is often referred 
to as cloning because you’re essentially 
making a duplicate of a selected area 
and then moving that duplicate 
elsewhere.
When cloning, your cursor icon 
changes to a double-headed arrow, 
notifying you that you’re duplicating 
the selection. 
Moving the selection outline, but not the pixels
If all you want to do is move the selection marquee without moving the 
pixels underneath, avoid using the Move tool. Instead, grab any selection 
tool — a Marquee tool, a Lasso tool, or the Magic Wand tool — and then 
click inside the marquee and just drag. That way, you move only the outline 
of the element, not the element itself. You can also use the arrow keys to 
nudge a selection marquee.
Transforming Pixels
After you perfectly select your element, you may find you need to resize or 
reorient that element. Transforming involves scaling, rotating, skewing, dis-
torting, warping, flipping, or adjusting the perspective of your pixels. 
Follow these steps to transform a selection:
 
1. Create your selection.
PhotoDisc
Figure 3-8: Hold down Alt (Option on the 
Mac) while dragging to clone your selection 
and not leave a nasty hole.

272
Transforming Pixels
 
 I’ll leave this task up to you; just use your well-honed selection expertise 
(or refer to earlier sections in this chapter for help).
 
 You can also apply transformations to a layer or to multiple layers (for 
more on this topic, see Book V).
 
2. Choose Edit➪Transform.
 
 If all you want is a single transformation, this command is adequate. 
However, if you want multiple transformations, you’re wise to stick 
with the Free Transform command, which I cover later in the sidebar 
“Distorting selected pixels with Free Transform.”
 
3. Choose a transformation type from the submenu:
 
 Scale: Increases or decreases the size of your selection.
 
 Rotate: Freely rotates your selection in either direction.
 
 Skew: Distorts your selection on a given axis.
 
 Distort: Distorts your selection with no restrictions on an axis.
 
 Perspective: Applies a one-point perspective to your selection.
 
 Warp: This option is like a mini-Liquify command, which you can use 
to distort your selection by manipulating a mesh grid that overlays 
your image. (Book VII, Chapter 3 covers Liquify.)
 
 Rotate 180°, 90° CW (Clockwise), or 90° CCW (Counterclockwise): 
Rotates the selection by specified amounts.
 
 Flip Horizontal or Vertical: Flips your selection along the vertical 
and horizontal axes, respectively.
 
 As soon as you select your desired distortion and release the mouse 
button, a box called the bounding box or transform box surrounds your 
selection, complete with handles on the sides and corners. You don’t get 
a bounding box when you select the Flip or Rotate (by degrees) transfor-
mations (which just get applied to your image).
 
4. Depending on which transformation type you choose in Step 3, drag 
the appropriate handle:
 
 Scale: Corner handles work best for this transformation. Hold down 
Shift to scale proportionately. Hold down Alt (Option on the Mac) to 
scale from the center.
 
 Rotate: Move your cursor outside the bounding box. When the 
cursor becomes a curved arrow, drag clockwise or counterclock-
wise. Hold down Shift to rotate in 15-degree increments.
 
 Skew: Drag a side handle.
 
 Distort: Drag a corner handle.
 
 Perspective: Drag a corner handle.

273
Book III
Chapter 3

Selections and Paths
Transforming Pixels
 
 Warp: Drag any control point or line on the default custom mesh grid 
to distort your selection. In fact, you can pretty much drag anywhere 
on the image, even in between mesh lines, to apply the warp. You 
can’t, however, add or delete control points.
 
 With the Warp transformation, you have some additional options. The 
Options bar has a drop-down list with various warping styles, such as arch, 
wave, and twist. In fact, these are the same styles you can find on the Warp 
Text menu (see Book IV, Chapter 3). When you choose one of the styles, 
Photoshop then applies the mesh grid for that style. Here’s the lowdown 
on the remaining options:
 
 Change the warp orientation: Change the direction of some styles, 
such as wave, flag, and fish.
 
 Bend: Increase or decrease the value, or drag the handle on the warp 
style, to increase the distortion.
 
 H% and V%: Increase the percentages to increase the horizontal (H) 
and vertical (V) distortions.
 
 Switch between Free Transform and Warp mode: Click this button 
to switch between the Free Transform box and the Warp mesh grid.
 
 Choosing Rotate 180°, 90° CW, or 90° CCW, or Flip Horizontal or Vertical 
just executes the command. Handle-dragging isn’t necessary.
 
 Photoshop executes all the transformations, except Warp, around a 
point called the reference point. The reference point appears in the 
center of the transform box by default.
 
 You can move the center point anywhere you want, even outside the 
bounding box. In addition, you can set your own reference point for 
the transformation by clicking a square on the reference point locator 
on the Options bar. Each square corresponds with a point on the bound-
ing box.
 
5. (Optional) Choose a second transformation type from the Edit➪
Transform submenu, if desired.
 
 If you’re an ultra-precise type of person, you can also numerically trans-
form the selection by entering values on the Options bar.
 
 In Figure 3-9, I executed all the transformations at the same time.
 
 Execute all your transformations in one fell swoop, if possible. In other 
words, don’t scale a selection now and then five minutes later rotate it 
and then five minutes after that distort it because every time you apply 
a transformation to an image, you’re putting it through an interpolation 
process. You want to limit how many times you interpolate an image 
because it has a degrading effect — your image starts to appear soft 
and mushy. Only flipping or rotating in 90-degree increments is 
interpolation-free. For more on interpolation, see Book II, Chapter 1.

274
Transforming Selection Marquees
 
6. After you transform your 
selection to your liking, click the 
Commit button on the Options 
bar, or press Enter (Return on the 
Mac).
 
 To cancel the transformation, 
press Esc or click the Cancel 
button on the Options bar.
 
 Your image is now magically trans-
formed. If your image isn’t on a 
layer, you can leave a hole filled 
with the background color after 
your image is transformed. Check 
out Book V to avoid this calamity.
 
To repeat a transformation, choose 
Edit➪Transform➪Again.
Transforming Selection 
Marquees
To transform just the selection mar-
quee — without affecting the underlying 
pixels — make your desired selection 
and then choose Select➪Transform 
Selection. Photoshop doesn’t have a 
submenu with individual transforma-
tions to choose from. Instead, you must 
apply the transformations like you do 
with the Free Transform command: by 
using the keyboard shortcuts. You can 
also enter values on the Options bar 
to transform numerically, or you can 
access the context menu. To move the 
selection marquee and the bounding 
box, simply drag inside the marquee 
or nudge it by pressing the keyboard 
arrow keys. Transforming selections is 
particularly handy when you’re trying 
to select elliptical objects. Getting a 
precise selection the first time around 
is often hard, so you may need to apply 
a transformation. For example, in Figure 
3-10, I scaled, rotated, and distorted the 
marquee around my plate to get a more 
accurate selection.

Using Content-Aware Scaling
Using Content-Aware Scaling
 
Content-Aware Scaling is a new, cool feature also known as “Seam Carving” 
and is based on an image resizing algorithm developed by Shai Avidan and 
Ariel Shamir. (See www.seamcarving.com for a great video demo.) This 
method of scaling enables you to resize and reshape your images without 
overdistorting the content and composition of those images. It also pre-
serves image quality much better than traditional transformations. Although 
the exact way the algorithm works is technically complex, don’t worry. It’s 
pretty darn simple to use. Here’s how to apply content-aware scaling:
 
1. Choose your desired layer in the Layers Panel. If you want to isolate 
the scaling to a selection on the layer, make that selection now.
 
 Note that Content-Aware scaling doesn’t work on adjustment layers, 
layer masks, individual channels or Smart Objects. For more on layers 
and Smart Objects, see Book V. For more on channels, see Book VI.
 
2. Choose Edit➪Content-Aware Scale.
 
3.  Specify your options in the Options bar as follows:
 
• Threshold: To minimize distortion, specify your Threshold percent-
age. Start with a higher percentage and then adjust accordingly, if 
necessary. 
 
• Protect: You can designate areas that you want to protect from scal-
ing by selecting them and saving them as alpha channels. (See Book 
VI, Chapter 1.) If you have an alpha channel, choose it from this 
sub-menu.
 
• Protect Skin Tone (man icon): Select this option to preserve skin 
tones from being distorted when scaling.
Distorting selected pixels with Free Transform
The Transform menu isn’t the only way to distort 
selected pixels. A much more efficient way is to 
use the Free Transform command, also on the 
Edit menu. Like the Transform command, the 
Free Transform command surrounds your selec-
tion with a bounding box. Within the bounding 
box, you can scale, rotate, skew, distort, or 
apply perspective without having to choose the 
individual distortions. You just have to use the 
right keyboard shortcuts. To scale and rotate, 
use the same method as the Transform com-
mands. Here’s the scoop on the rest:
 ✓ Skew: Ctrl+Shift-drag (Ô+Shift-drag on the 
Mac) on a side, or corner, handle.
 ✓ Distort: Ctrl-drag (Ô-drag on the Mac) on 
any handle.
 ✓ Perspective: Ctrl+Shift+Alt-drag (Ô+Shift+
Option-drag on the Mac) on a corner handle.

276
Transforming Paths
 
4. Click and drag one of the handles of the scale box that surrounds your 
layer or selection to resize your image. 
 
 Note that you can upscale (make your image bigger) or downscale 
(make your image smaller). You can also use the Horizontal and Vertical 
Scale numerical fields in the Options bar.
 
5. When you have completed your scale, double-click inside the scale 
box, or press Enter on your keyboard. 
 
 Check out Figure 3-11 to see the difference between a layer resized with 
Content-Aware scaling and Free Transform. Note how there is less dis-
tortion with the first method.

Transforming Paths
After you create a bounding box around the path (see Book III, Chapter 2 for 
more on paths), the transformation technique for paths is the same as it is 
for selections and selection marquees, except that you can apply the Distort, 
Perspective, and Warp commands only to whole paths. The major difference 
between transforming paths and selections is in how you first select the path.
To select all paths, follow these steps:

2. Click the pathname in the Paths panel.
 
3. Select the Path Selection tool.
 
4. Click the path by using the Path Selection

Transforming Paths
Putting It Together
Removing a Person (Without Getting in Trouble with the Law)
Follow these steps to seamlessly remove an unwanted element (in this case, a person) 
from an image:
 
When you ﬁ rst attempt this technique, start with an 
image that has an element that isn’t physically attached 
to something you want to keep in the image.
 
1. Open an image that contains something you want 
to remove.
 
2. Use the selection tool of your choice to select the 
element that you want to remove.
 
 You don’t have to be super-precise, so feel free to 
grab the Lasso tool. If you need a Lasso refresher, 
see Book III, Chapter 1. When you make your 
selection, be careful not to cut off any portion of 
your element. Otherwise, you leave some stray 
pixels — a dead giveaway that something was 
once there. Using the Lasso tool, I made a rough 
outline around the woman on the right, as shown 
in the ﬁ gure.
 
3. Position your cursor inside the selection mar-
quee, press and hold the mouse button and then 
hold down the Shift key, and drag your selection 
to move it horizontally (or vertically, if the image 
warrants it) to an area of the photo that you want 
to clone.
 
 The selection marquee, shown in the ﬁ gure, is the 
only thing that I moved.
 
4. With the Move tool selected, position your cur-
sor inside the selection marquee, hold down 
Alt+Shift (Option+Shift on the Mac), and then 
drag to move the cloned area on top of the ele-
ment that you’re removing. Carefully match up 
the edges, release your mouse button, and then 
release the Alt and Shift keys (Option and Shift 
on the Mac).

5. Choose Select➪Deselect.
 
 The cloned area now covers the element that you 
want to remove, as shown in the ﬁ gure. In the 
example, the beach/ocean selection now covers 
the woman.
 
 Depending on your image, you may want to 
choose Select➪Modify➪Feather and enter a 
pixel or so before you move the cloned area. 
Feathering softens the edges and smoothes 
out the transition between the cloned area and 
the background. (See the section “Feathering a 
selection,” in this chapter, for more on feather-
ing.) I didn’t feather my selection because it didn’t 
really need it. Try it both ways to see which looks 
better. Use the History panel to undo your steps, if 
necessary (see Book II, Chapter 4 for more on the 
History panel).
 
 The ﬁ nal step is to clean up any telltale signs that the element was there.
 
6. Select the Clone Stamp tool and select a medium-size feathered brush from the 
Brush Preset picker on the Options bar or from 
the Brushes panel, hold down Alt (Option on 
the Mac), and click a good area next to a ﬂ aw; 
release Alt (Option on the Mac) and then click 
the ﬂ aw.
 
 If the Clone Stamp is a mystery to you, be sure to 
check out Book VIII, Chapter 3.
 
 Repeat this step until you ﬁ x all the ﬂ aws and the 
clone blends in seamlessly with the background. 
Don’t get carried away with the Clone Stamp 
tool, or you end up with a smudgy mess. Being 
light-handed is a good thing, as I was in the now-
retouched image. Nobody can tell that only two 
people stand where three people once stood.

and Typing

L
ike a Swiss Army knife, Photoshop does it all. 
This book describes all you need to know 
about Photoshop’s drawing and painting tools. I 
first give you the lowdown on the ubiquitous 
brush. The brush — which is found not only in the 
Brush tool itself but within several other painting 
and editing tools — has more variations than you 
can shake a stick at. I also cover how to create vec-
tor shapes with the Shape tools and how to fill and 
stroke your selections with color. If one color is not 
enough, keep reading until you get to the section 
on gradients and patterns. I give you the steps for 
using the many Photoshop presets and also for cre-
ating your own gradients and patterns. Rounding 
out this section will be an introduction to the new 
3D Tools. And finally, because man doesn’t commu-
nicate by images alone, you can find lots of useful 
information about creating type. Not just regular 
old run-of-the-mill type, mind you (which is cov-
ered of course), but type on a path, type with shad-
ows and bevels, type filled with images, type 
warped into shapes — you get the . . . um . . . 
picture.

Chapter 1: Painting and Drawing 
with Photoshop
In This Chapter
✓ Making pencil sketches and brush strokes
✓ Using Brush presets
✓ Managing brushes with the Brushes panel
✓ Understanding vectors
✓ Creating basic and custom shapes
✓ Setting geometry options
You’re definitely going to want to brush up on your painting and 
drawing techniques now that you don’t have to worry 
about messing up your clothes. Painting is one of the 
basic skills you need to work in Photoshop. After you 
master the art of painting strokes and working with 
brushes, you’re well on your way to mastering 
more advanced techniques, such as masking and 
retouching, which benefit from strong painting 
skills. (I introduce the full range of Brush tools in 
Book I, Chapter 2.)
Going hand in hand with painting, of course, is 
drawing. Photoshop’s shape tools add an impor-
tant dimension to your drawing capabilities. This 
chapter introduces you to a plethora of tools and 
techniques. I start with painting and then move on to 
drawing. Embrace both, and they can serve you well.
Introducing the Pencil and Brush Tools
The Pencil and Brush tools are like peanut butter and chocolate. Not only 
do they work well together, but they also share many important traits. Just 
as important, however, are their differences. You can access these tools 
in the Tools panel. Press B to make the Brush tool appear by default. To 
access the Pencil, press Shift+B. You can toggle between these tools, along 
with the Color Replacement tool, by pressing Shift+B again. Find out more 
about using these tools in the following sections.

284
Introducing the Pencil and Brush Tools
Finding out what the Pencil tool does
The Pencil and Brush tools are very much alike, except that the Pencil tool 
has hard edges by default (as shown in Figure 1-1) and the Brush tool can 
have soft, feathered edges. The Pencil tool can also erase what it creates!
Illustration by Chris Blair
Figure 1-1: The Pencil tool draws hard-edged strokes and is perfect 
for digital sketches.
You can do all the following with the Pencil tool:
 
✓ Drag the mouse to draw freehand lines.
 
✓ Click at one point, release the mouse button, and then Shift-click at a 
second point to draw a straight line between the points. As long as you 
hold down the Shift key, you can keep clicking to draw straight lines 
between each of the points.
 
✓ Press the Alt key (the Option key on the Mac) and click in any area of 
your drawing to switch the foreground color to that hue.
 
✓ When using the Pencil, as well as the Brush and Color Replacement 
tools, press and hold down the V key to temporarily access the 
Move tool. Release the V key to return to the Pencil, Brush, or Color 
Replacement tool. This handy new shortcut enables you to move a layer 
or selection while drawing or painting without having to go back and 
forth to the Tools panel.

285
Book IV
Chapter 1
Painting and 
Drawing with 
Photoshop
Introducing the Pencil and Brush Tools
 
The Pencil tool also offers the Auto Erase option, which you activate from 
the Options bar at the top. Auto Erase is a handy feature that lets you 
remove portions of your pencil strokes without switching to the Eraser tool. 
When you have Auto Erase turned on, the operation of the Pencil tool is 
slightly different from the default. The effect of either of the following 
actions is that Photoshop erases lines you’ve drawn:
 
✓ When you click in any area of the drawing other than an area that’s fore-
ground colored (for example, the pencil lines you’ve already drawn), 
the Pencil tool begins drawing a line in the foreground color (this is the 
default mode).
 
✓ When you click in any area of the drawing that’s foreground colored 
(such as the pencil lines you’ve drawn), the Pencil tool draws by using 
the background color.
 
Because the Pencil tool doesn’t use 
soft-edged lines to draw, anything 
other than straight vertical or horizon-
tal lines has rough, jagged edges (often 
called jaggies), as shown in the close-
up image in Figure 1-2. Jaggies aren’t 
objectionable in some cases, especially 
in higher-resolution images, but if you 
zoom in on an area containing pencil 
lines, the jaggies are readily apparent. I 
show you how to modify the character-
istics of the lines drawn with the Pencil 
tool in the section “Working with the 
Brushes panel,” later in this chapter.
Using the Pencil tool
If you’re ready to start using the Pencil tool, keep in mind that lines that aren’t 
vertical or horizontal look jagged up close. But this doesn’t necessarily pose a 
problem in all cases, especially when working with Web graphics. Those same 
hard edges can lend themselves to producing crisp-edged images for display 
in a browser window. To try out the Pencil tool, follow these steps:
 
 1. Activate the Pencil tool by selecting it from the Tools panel.
 
 The Pencil tool shares a flyout menu with the Brush tool. You can press 
Shift+B to make it appear if it’s hidden underneath the Brush tool.
 
 The Pencil tool’s current brush tip (usually the 1-pixel brush, unless 
you select something else) appears in the Brush Preset picker on the 
Options bar.
 
 Click the thumbnail or arrow in the Brush box to summon the Brush 
Preset Picker panel if you want to select a different-size pencil tip.
Figure 1-2: Zooming in on hard-edged 
strokes displays jagged edges.

286
Introducing the Pencil and Brush Tools
 
2. If you want to draw using anything other than Normal mode, select a 
mode from the Mode options menu.
 
 Blend modes other than Normal cause colors to interact and blend in 
different ways. (You can find more about modes in Book V, Chapter 3.)
 
3. Select an opacity for your pencil strokes.
 
 If you want whatever is in the background to show partially through 
your strokes, select an opacity of less than 100 percent by using the 
slider or by typing an opacity percentage directly into the text box.
 
4. Click and drag with the mouse to create your pencil lines.
Painting with the Brush tool
The Brush tool is a basic tool used throughout Photoshop in various incar-
nations, so master its use as quickly as possible.
The most important difference between the Brush and the Pencil tools is 
that, by default, the Brush tool produces soft-edged lines that Photoshop 
renders smoother by a process known as anti-aliasing. This technique sub-
stitutes partially filled pixels along the edges of lines to produce the illusion 
of gradual fading. Our eyes merge the transparent pixels together, so the line 
looks smooth rather than hard-edged.
Although jagged edges are most 
apparent in diagonal lines, Photoshop 
applies anti-aliasing to brush stroke 
edges, even in horizontal and vertical 
lines. The fuzzier the brush, the more 
semi-filled pixels used to produce the 
effect, as you can see in Figure 1-3.
The Brush tool shares most of the 
basic features found in the Pencil tool, 
except the Auto Erase feature isn’t 
available:
 
✓ Select the Brush tool from the 
Tools panel or press B or Shift+B 
until you get the Brush.
 
✓ Select a brush tip from the Brush 
Preset Picker on the Options bar.

✓ Drag to paint, click and Shift-click to paint straight lines, and hold down 
the Shift key while dragging to constrain the Brush tool to horizontal or 
vertical lines.
 
✓ Press the Alt key (the Option key on the Mac) and click in any area of 
color to switch the foreground color to that color.
The Brush tool has several other options to select from:
 
✓ Flow: Flow determines how quickly the Brush tool applies the paint. You 
can set a flow rate from 1 to 100 percent by using the Flow slider or by 
typing a percentage directly into the text box. You might think of it as 
controlling how liquid the paint is. At low flow rates, Photoshop applies 
the paint slowly so the color is not as intense; at higher flow rates, the 
paint quickly reaches its full strength while you drag.
 
✓ Airbrush: Click the Airbrush button on the 
Options bar to switch the Brush tool (as well 
as many of the other tools that use brush 
tips) to Airbrush mode. This mode produces 
the spray effect you get with a traditional air-
brush. The longer you hold down the mouse 
button, the more paint pumps out of the tool, 
and the wider the airbrush effect spreads, as 
shown in Figure 1-4.
 
✓ Toggle the Brushes Panel: At the far right 
of the Options bar is a button (a panel icon) 
that shows or hides the Brushes panel. This 
button is a quick way to access this valuable 
panel, and it’s also available with the Pencil 
tool and other tools that use brush tips. I 
show you how to use the Brushes panel in the 
following section.
Working with the Brushes panel
You’ll find the Brushes panel extremely useful for changing the characteris-
tics of preset brush tips and for creating your own. You can also access and 
select brush presets, as I discuss in the section “Using the preset brushes,” 
later in this chapter.
Figure 1-4: Using the Airbrush 
option with the Brush tool 
enables you to create smoky 
strokes.

Introducing the Pencil and Brush Tools
You can view the Brushes panel in several ways:
 
✓ Choose Window➪Brushes from the menu bar.
 
✓ Click the Brushes panel icon in the Dock.
 
✓ Toggle the Brushes panel button on the right side of the Options bar.
 
✓ Press F5 to toggle the Brushes panel open or closed.
 
✓ Grab the Brushes panel’s icon and drag it out of the Dock and onto 
your Photoshop desktop. This mode keeps the Brushes panel easily 
accessible until you put it away by dragging it back to the Dock, 
clicking its Close box, or rendering it hidden by choosing Window➪
Brushes.
The Brushes panel displays a list of brush properties on the left and includes 
a brush-stroke preview at the bottom of the panel.
The largest pane in the dialog box is the upper-right area that shows various 
types of information, such as the size and type of brush tip, or the different 
controls offered for any of the twelve different properties you can set.
Click the Brush Presets label in the upper-left of the dialog box. The vari-
ous preset previews appear in the right panel, as well as a Master Diameter 
slider below the presets
Choosing a brush-tip shape
When you have Brush Tip Shape 
selected in the left column of the 
Brushes panel, a scrolling box shows 
the available brush tips, as shown in 
Figure 1-5. 
The twelve brush parameters you can 
choose to apply and edit are arrayed 
in the left column. You can select any 
of these options to apply them to the 
currently selected brush. Click on 
the option name to edit its character-
istics. Note that you must select the 
parameter name to access the options. 
Toggling the parameter on by check-
ing the check box doesn’t work. Here 
are the characteristics for Brush Tip 
Shape:
Figure 1-5: The Brushes panel offers a 
multitude of different brush tips.

Book IV
Chapter 1

Introducing the Pencil and Brush Tools
 
✓ Shape Dynamics: These controls include the amount of jitter (random-
ness or variation) produced when you draw a stroke, the amount of 
fade, the size, the jitter angle, the roundness, and other options. The 
higher the value, the greater the amount of variance for each option. 
Some of these options apply only when you’re using a pressure-sensitive 
digital tablet. Check your digital tablet’s instruction manual for more 
information on how to customize brushes for your tablet. The Flip X and 
Flip Y jitter option flips the brush shape across the horizontal axis (X) 
or the vertical axis (Y). For example, if your brush is an L shape and you 
select Flip X, your brush shape becomes a backward L. Check Flip Y to 
make your brush shape an upside down L shape. Check both to make it 
an upside-down, backward L shape.
 
✓ Scattering: This parameter controls the number and position of brush 
marks in a stroke. The higher the value, the higher the number of 
brush marks and the farther apart they are. When you have Both Axes 
selected, Photoshop distributes the brush marks radially, as if on a 
curve. The Count controls the number of brush marks at each spacing 
point. The higher the value, the greater the number of marks.
 
✓ Texture: This control allows you to impart a texture pattern (using the 
foreground color) to a brush stroke, either one of Photoshop’s preset 
textures or one of your design. Select Invert to reverse the light and 
dark pixels in the pattern. Scale sizes the pattern in each stroke. Texture 
Each Tip renders each tip when it’s stroked, giving a more saturated 
effect. Depth controls how prominent the pattern appears against the 
brush stroke. Minimum Depth specifies the minimum depth that the 
paint of each stroke shows through the pattern. Mode lets you choose 
one of Photoshop’s blending modes, as I describe in Book V, Chapter 3. 
You can find more about creating and working with patterns in Book III, 
Chapter 3.
 
✓ Dual Brush: You can use two tips to draw with a single brush. This 
option lets you select the characteristics of the second tip by using the 
same type of attributes — such as diameter, spacing, and scatter — 
that you applied to the first tip. You can also specify a blending mode 
between the two tips.
 
✓ Color Dynamics: This control uses your foreground and background 
colors to adjust how the color varies during a stroke, allowing you to 
create a multicolored brush. Slight variations give the stroke a more 
natural, organic look. You can introduce slight (or major) jitter to the 
hue, saturation, brightness, and purity of the colors, as well as some 
randomness between the foreground and background colors when 
you draw a stroke. Without color dynamics, the stroke color remains 
constant.

290
Introducing the Pencil and Brush Tools
 
✓ Other Dynamics: These options introduce randomness into the opacity 
and flow factors of a brush, again making the brush stroke look more 
natural and less machine-generated. Experiment with all the dynamics 
to see exactly how they can affect your image. Note that the Flow and 
Opacity settings in the Brushes panel don’t override those settings on 
the Options bar.
Here’s a list of brush-tip characteristics, which you can find on the left side 
of the Brushes panel:
 
✓ Noise: Adds random pixels to brush tips, giving them texture and an 
organic quality. This option is more apparent in feathered brushes.
 
✓ Wet Edges: The brush tip leaves a stroke that looks more like water-
color, with paint building up along the edges.
 
✓ Airbrush: Gives the brush tip a soft, airbrushed look.
 
✓ Smoothing: Smoothes out the curves when you draw arcs with the 
brush. Again, this option is more noticeable when you use a pressure-
sensitive drawing tablet.
 
✓ Protect Texture: Ensures that all brush tips that use a texture use the 
same texture. So, you can switch back and forth between brush tips 
while painting and still achieve a consistent texture.
Figure 1-6 shows the range of possibilities these options offer.
 
You can lock any of the brush characteristics by clicking the small lock icon 
to the right of the characteristic. Locking a characteristic ensures that the 
settings don’t change after you have your brush just so. This works espe-
cially well if you want the size of your brush to be correlated with the 
amount of pressure you apply to a stylus when using a drawing tablet. By 
locking settings, you override any specifications set by preset brushes. You 
can select the Reset All Locked Settings option from the Brushes panel 
pop-up menu to bring back the default settings of the brush. And finally, to 
clear all brush options, select Clear Brush Controls from the Brushes panel 
pop-up menu.
 
If you really like a brush you’ve created, feel free to save it as a preset that 
you can access again and again. Simply select New Brush Preset from the 
pop-up menu on the Brushes panel or from the Brushes drop-down panel on 
the Options bar.

Using the preset brushes
Photoshop has two brush panels, in a sense. In addition to the Brushes 
panel, there’s the Brush Preset Picker, shown in Figure 1-7. It’s tucked away 
on the Options bar and appears when you click the down-pointing triangle 
next to the box that displays the currently active brush tip.
Photoshop has a large number of predesigned brush presets that you can 
use. The default set includes six round, hard-edged brushes (which still have 
softer edges than the Pencil tool) and a group of twelve round soft-edged 
brushes. There are also airbrush, spatter, and natural media brush-tip pre-
sets, as well as a group of brush-tip shapes such as stars, leaves, and other 
shapes. You can also download brushes galore from the Web, so go crazy.

292
Introducing the Pencil and Brush Tools
Figure 1-7: The Brush Preset Picker offers a mini Brushes 
panel for quick and simplified access to brush tips.
A preset brush’s pixel diameters are shown as text below a thumbnail image 
of the brush shape when the panel’s display is in default mode. To use one 
of these brush tips, just click the Brush Preset Picker arrow or thumbnail 
on the Options bar and select the tip you want from the scrolling preset list. 
You can augment your choices with any of the following options:
 
✓ Move the Master Diameter slider to change the diameter of the 
selected brush. This is a quick way of getting a slightly larger or smaller 
brush when none of the presets meet your needs exactly. For example, 
the largest hard-edged brush preset is 19 pixels in diameter. You can 
click this brush tip and move the slider to the right to get a hard-edged 
brush in any size up to 2,500 pixels.
 
 To change the brush size by using the keyboard when a tool is active, 
press the ] key (the right bracket) to increase the size and the [ key (the 
left bracket) to decrease the size. The amount of change varies accord-
ing to the initial size of the brush. To adjust the size more dramatically, 
continue to press the bracket key.

293
Book IV

✓ Select the Use Sample Size option (available with certain brushes) to 
get brush strokes of equal size. Depending on the size settings in your 
Shape Dynamics characteristics, when you use a scatter brush, such 
as a fish or flower, you get random variations in sizes. Select the Use 
Sample Size option before you use the brush to get a consistent-size 
stroke every time (based on a preset sample size). Note that you must 
select the option each time you use the brush, and you must also click, 
not drag, the brush for each individual stroke to be equally sized.
 
✓ Select any of the libraries of additional brush-tip presets provided with 
Photoshop. Click the Brush Preset Picker’s pop-up menu and select one 
of the other brush libraries shown at the bottom. They have names like 
Special Effect Brushes and Faux Finish Brushes. Select one to append the 
brushes to your current set or to replace the current set with the library 
you select (a dialog box appears that offers a choice of either action).
 
 You can also manage brush-tip libraries by using the Preset Manager. 
(See Book I, Chapter 5 for information on using the Preset Manager.)
 
✓ Select your own custom library of brush tips that you’ve created. Click 
Load Brushes to append new brushes to your current collection or to 
replace them with the new library.
 
✓ If the Hardness option is available, adjust the slider to make the brush 
more (higher) or less (lower) fuzzy.
In addition to the presets Photoshop offers, you can create your own presets 
to use when you need them. Book I, Chapter 2 explains how to create your 
own presets.
Viewing preset brushes
You can change the way brushes are shown in the Brushes Preset Picker 
and Brushes panel by selecting a viewing mode from the Picker’s or panel’s 
pop-up menu:
 
✓ Text Only: This displays the names of the brush tips in several columns 
(depending on how wide you’ve made the panel).
 
✓ Small Thumbnail: This is the default view, with a thumbnail image of 
the brush tip and its diameter in pixels.
 
✓ Large Thumbnail: This view provides a closer look at the brush tip.
 
✓ Small List: This view shows a column list of the brush tips with their 
text names and small thumbnail.
 
✓ Large List: This view shows a column list of the brush tips with their 
text names and larger thumbnail.
 
✓ Stroke Thumbnail: This view shows a typical stroke by using the 
selected brush so you can see how it looks when applied.

Putting It Together
Colorizing Black-and-White Images
Just as there are valid artistic reasons for shooting a photo in black and white, there 
are equally reasonable rationales for changing a grayscale image into a color one. 
Perhaps the picture is an old one, taken before color ﬁ lm was widely used, and you 
want to colorize it. Or you may come across a monochrome image that would look 
even better in color. Photoshop lets you restore black-and-white pictures to their origi-
nal colors or create whole new color schemes. If you can imagine an image in color, 
use Photoshop to add the hues you want to see.
IT Stock Free
 
In my example, which you can ﬁ nd on this book’s Web site (see the Introduction for 
details), I chose a black-and-white photo of an adorable boy. Rather than a full-color 
treatment that attempts to duplicate a color photograph, I want to apply a technique 
that mimics the hand-colored look of the venerable Marshall’s Photo Coloring System 
of pigments, photo oils, spot colors, retouch pencils, and other products so popular in 
the ’50s and ’60s (and enjoying a rebirth today). Although I’ve worked with a Marshall’s 
kit myself, Photoshop is a lot faster, easier, and way less messy.
 
1. Open a grayscale image in Photoshop.
 
2. Choose Image➪Mode➪RGB Color to convert the grayscale image to a full-color 
image (even though it presently still lacks any color).

continued
 
3. Choose Layer➪New➪Layer.
 
 This creates a new transparent layer to paint on, as shown in the ﬁ gure. Although 
you can paint directly on an image layer (or a copy of an image layer), using an 
empty layer is safer — and gives you more ﬂ exibility in backtracking when you 
make a mistake. (For more information on working with layers, consult Book V.)
 
4. In the New Layer dialog box that appears, name the layer and then click OK.
 
 You can paint all your colors on a single layer, but you may ﬁ nd that using a sepa-
rate layer for each part of the face lets you fade that color in and out as required 
to blend smoothly with your other hues.
 
5. Select the Color mode from the Blend Mode 
drop-down list in the Layers panel.
 
 Photoshop uses this mode to combine the paint-
ing layer with the image layer, enabling you to 
apply color while retaining the details of the 
underlying image.
 
6. Select a color you want to apply from the 
Swatches panel or use the Color panel to mix 
your own.
 
 You can ﬁ nd information on color in Book II, Chapter 3.
 
7. Select the Brush tool in the Tools panel.
 
8. Click the down arrow next to the Brush Preset Picker on the Options bar and 
select a brush from the list.
 
 Hard-edged brushes appear ﬁ rst, and the soft-edged brushes follow. I would start 
with a soft-edged brush.
 
 The Airbrush option on the Options bar creates a very subtle and soft effect. 
Just be sure you pick the kind of brush that works best for the area of the picture 
you’re colorizing. (Use a small, fuzzy brush for smaller areas, and use a bigger, 
sharper brush for more deﬁ ned lines and wider areas.)
 
9. Paint all the parts of the image where you want to apply color.
 
 If you make a mistake, you can erase the bad 
strokes without affecting the underlying grayscale 
image because you’re painting on a separate layer.
 
 In my example, I chose a nice, light blue color to 
change the color of the boy’s eyes, as shown in 
the ﬁ gure. A small fuzzy brush is perfect for a small 
area such as the eyes.

296
Introducing the Pencil and Brush Tools
 
 Change brushes as necessary by clicking the Brush Preset Picker on the Options 
bar and selecting a larger or smaller brush.
 
10. When you ﬁ nish with that area of the image, create a new layer for each of the 
main components of the photograph and repeat Steps 4 through 9 with an ad-
ditional color.
 
 I painted the eyes, lips, cheeks, hair, and hair highlights separately because 
creating natural, subtle effects with people’s skin, hair, and eyes takes a special 
touch:
 
✓ Eyes: When painting the eyes, paint only the irises and leave the pupils 
their original black color. Don’t paint over the catchlights in the eyes, either. 
(Catchlights are reﬂ ections of light sources, such as windows or the ﬂ ash.)
 
✓ Lips: Color the inner surface of the lips a darker, rosier pink than the outer 
surface. Lips look best when portrayed in at least two shades. Don’t forget to 
color the gums with an even lighter pink.
 
✓ Hair: Hair looks best when the highlights and darker portions are slightly dif-
ferent colors.
 
✓ Cheeks: To put a little blush in the cheeks, choose the Airbrush option on the 
Options bar and work with a relatively large brush size. Apply a good dash of 
color to each cheek and a lighter bit of color to the forehead and chin. (I used 
a 300-pixel brush for this high-resolution image.)
 
 I left the clothes and background uncolored to emphasize that the focal point 
is the boy’s face.
 
11. For the overall skin tone, I chose a different technique, using the Hue/Saturation 
command. This technique works especially well with those who have naturally 
dark complexions. You can choose to paint the skin with a brush or use this 
technique:
 
✓ Duplicate the grayscale image layer and then choose Image➪Adjustments➪
Hue/Saturation.
 
✓ Choose the Colorize option and move the Hue slider to the left to produce a 
sepia tone. I set my Hue to 36. Set Saturation to 25 percent and click OK to 
colorize this layer.
 
✓ Use the Eraser tool to remove everything in the colorized layer that isn’t skin. 
In my example, I removed the hair, background, eyes, lips, teeth, and clothing. 
This result is a nice sepia tone to the face.
 
 
Be sure to pick a color that’s as close to real life as possible. If the subject 
has darker skin, you may need to move away from rosier blush tones.

12. When you ﬁ nish coloring your layers, you can experiment with different opacity 
levels for each colorized layer to see whether more-transparent hues might look 
better.
 
Drawing with Vector Shapes
Although I’m a big fan of photos and all the pixels that make up those 
photos, sometimes you have to call on a vector or two. Maybe you need to 
create a simple line art graphic for a Web page. Or perhaps you want to add 
a logo onto a poster. In these instances, drawing a vector shape with the Pen 
or Shape tool is the way to go.
Before you begin creating vector shapes in Photoshop, having a firm grasp 
on the basics of pixels versus vectors is a big help. Vectors describe a shape 
mathematically; pixel images, on the other hand, describe the same shape 
in terms of a map of pixels. The key difference is that, while you increase the 

298
Drawing with Vector Shapes
size of a pixel-based image, it begins to look blocky. Because vector images 
are based on mathematical formulas, they look good at any size. Figure 1-8 
shows both types of image. I explain the difference between vector and 
pixel-based images in more detail in Book II, Chapter 1.
Vector image
Pixel image
Figure 1-8: Photoshop images fall into one of two camps — vector or pixel.
When you create vector objects in a program like Photoshop, they’re com-
prised of paths, which are in turn made up of anchor points and straight and 
curved segments, or lines. You can create these points and lines by work-
ing with the preset shapes or by creating your own shape. The presets are 
easier to work with, but the custom shapes enable you to be more creative. 
In the following sections, I walk you through the steps for creating vector 
shapes, as well as the various options.
Drawing a preset shape
Follow these steps to draw a preset shape in your document:
 
1. Select a Shape tool from the Tools panel.
 
 You can also press U and select the shape tool from the Options bar. 
You can select from the following shape tools (shown in Figure 1-9):
 
• Rectangle/Ellipse: The rectangle and ellipse have no special param-
eters on the Options bar; however, they both behave much like 
their counterparts among the selection tools. For example, you can 
hold down the Shift key while dragging a shape to produce a per-
fect square or circle; hold down Shift+Alt (Shift+Option on the Mac) 
to additionally draw the shape outward from the center. You have 
other Geometry options that let you determine how you draw the 
shapes (unconstrained, fixed size, from center, and so forth).
 
• Rounded Rectangle: This shape has the same options as the rect-
angle shape, with the addition of a box in which you can type the 
radius of the circle used to round off the corners of the rectangle.

Figure 1-9: The shape tools and Options bar give you everything you need to make shapes, from 
simple squares to ornate fleur de lys.
 
• Polygon: This shape includes a box in which you can enter the 
number of sides you want for the polygon, in the range of 3 to 100, as 
well as Geometry options.
 
• Line: You can give the line shape a width from 1 to 1,000 pixels and 
assign a layer style and/or fill color. You can also enter parameters 
for an arrowhead at either or both ends.
 
• Custom: You can find numerous preset custom shapes to choose 
from. Like with any shape, you hold down Shift to constrain propor-
tions or Alt (Option on the Mac) to draw from the center out.

300
Drawing with Vector Shapes
 
2. Select the mode of shape you want to draw from the three icons on 
the Options bar.
 
 Here’s a list of ways in which you can create a shape (all options are on 
the Options bar):
 
 
• Shape Layers: Click this icon to create the shape in a new layer of its 
own. When you select this mode, icons appear on the Options bar 
that let you select a layer style and/or fill color.
 
 Shape Layers is a good choice if you want to keep your shapes in 
separate layers so you can manipulate them further. (Some options 
include making the shapes appear to have been added together, 
subtracted from each other, and so on.) Photoshop links shapes in a 
shape layer to a vector mask, which can show or hide portions of an 
image. You can find out more about shape layers and vector masks 
in the sections “Creating your own custom shape” and “Using vector 
masks,” later in this chapter. The shapes remain scalable until you 
change them into pixels by choosing Layer➪Rasterize➪Shape.
 
 
• Paths: Click this icon to create the shape with a path which “hovers” 
over your image. The shape appears as a path that you can edit by 
using the pen tools and the Paths panel. (For everything you need to 
know about paths, check out Book III, Chapter 2.)
 
 
• Fill Pixels: Click this icon to create a shaped area filled with the fore-
ground color. This option doesn’t produce a vector shape, but 
instead fills the shape with pixels. The process is similar to filling a 
selection created with the Rectangular or Elliptical Marquee tools or 
painting on your canvas with a painting tool. When you select this 
mode, the Options bar includes choices that let you specify a blend-
ing mode, the transparency of the filled area, and whether you want 
the area anti-aliased. You can’t edit a shape created with this option, 
except to modify the pixels.
 
3. Select your options — both on the Options bar (if any) and in the 
Geometry options drop-down panel, which also resides on the 
Options bar.
 
 The Options bar changes to reflect each type of shape; each type has its 
own options, which are listed in Step 1. For detailed explanations on the 
various Geometry options, see the section “Setting Geometry options,” 
later in this chapter.
 
 If you chose the Custom Shape tool in Step 1, click the down-pointing 
arrow to access the drop-down Shapes panel. Select the shape that 
works for you. You can access more preset shape libraries via the 
pop-up menu at the top of the panel (refer to Figure 1-9).

301
Book IV
Chapter 1
Painting and 
Drawing with 
Photoshop
Drawing with Vector Shapes
 
4. Drag in the document to draw the shape you’ve defined.
 
 The shape appears in the image window. If you chose the Shape Layer 
mode in Step 2, the shape also appears in the Layers panel in its own 
layer. A rectangle filled with the foreground color appears in the image 
column, and the shape itself is shown in the mask column as a vector 
mask, as you can see in Figure 1-10. The black layer of peeks through my 
vector mask, which is in the shape of pinwheels.
Figure 1-10: When you create a shape layer, you’re creating a layer of color 
that shows through a vector mask (path) in the form of your shape.
Drawing multiple shapes in a shape layer
After you create a shape layer, you can draw additional shapes in the layer, 
adding to the vector mask associated with that layer. You can add, subtract, 
overlap, and intersect shapes in exactly the same way you do with selec-
tions, as described in Book III, Chapter 3. Follow these steps:
 
1. After you create the first shape, as I explain in the preceding section, 
select your desired state button on the Options bar:
 
 
• Add to Shape Area: Combines and joins two or more shapes

302
Drawing with Vector Shapes
 
 
• Subtract from Shape Area: Subtracts one shape from another 
shape
 
 
• Intersect Shape Areas: Creates a shape only from the areas that 
overlap
 
 
• Exclude Overlapping Shape Areas: Creates a shape only from the 
areas that don’t overlap
 
2. Grab your desired shape tool and draw the next shape.
 
 Hold down the Shift key to temporarily switch to Add to Shape Area 
while drawing a new shape. Hold down the Alt (Option on the Mac) key 
to temporarily switch to Subtract from Shape Area. This works just like 
adding or subtracting selections.
Setting Geometry options
Geometry options for your shapes (rectangle/rounded rectangle, ellipse, 
polygon, line, and custom) help define how the shapes look. Click the down-
pointing arrow on the Options bar to access the geometry options. The fol-
lowing sections show you what you can do with these options.
Rectangular-shape Geometry options
Here are the Geometry options for the rectangle and rounded rectangle 
shapes, as shown in Figure 1-11:
Figure 1-11: Geometry options define how your particular shape appears.
 
✓ Unconstrained: When you have this option (the default) selected, 
Photoshop defines the size and proportions of the rectangle while you drag.
 
✓ Square: Select this button to constrain the shape to a perfect square. 
(You can also hold down the Shift key to do the same thing on the fly.)
 
✓ Fixed Size: This option lets you draw rectangles only in fixed sizes. 
Specify the exact size by entering a width and height.

303
Book IV
Chapter 1
Painting and 
Drawing with 
Photoshop
Drawing with Vector Shapes
 
✓ Proportional: This option lets you define an aspect ratio, or proportion, 
for the rectangle. Type 3 into the W box and 4 into the H box to constrain 
yourself to drawing any size rectangle with fixed proportions in a 3:4 ratio.
 
✓ From Center: Select this option to expand the shape from the center 
point you click.
 
✓ Snap to Pixels: This option snaps the edges of a rectangle or rounded 
rectangle to the pixels on your screen.
Elliptical-shape Geometry options
The ellipse shape has the same options that are available for rectangles 
(also shown in Figure 1-11). Of course, instead of being able to create a per-
fect square, you can restrain the shape to be a perfect circle. Also, the Snap 
to Pixels option (available for rectangles) doesn’t exist for ellipses.
Polygonal-shape Geometry options
These are the Geometry options for the polygon 
shape, as shown in Figure 1-12:
 
✓ Radius: This option controls the distance 
from the center of a polygon to its outer 
points.
 
✓ Smooth Corners: Select this option to round 
off the corners.
 
✓ Star: Select this option to create a star 
shape — that is, a polygon in which the sides 
indent inward, rather than extend outward 
from the corner points.
 
✓ Indent Sides By: The value entered here determines the amount the 
sides indent inward.
 
✓ Smooth Indents: This option rounds off the inner corners created by 
indenting the sides.
 
✓ Sides: Directly in the Options bar, indicate the number of sides for your 
polygon or the number of points for your star.
Line Geometry options
The line’s Geometry settings include whether to put arrowheads at the start 
or end of the line, or both, as shown in Figure 1-13. Figure 1-13 also shows how 
changing the width, length, and concavity settings affect the arrowhead shapes.

Custom-shape Geometry options
The custom shape options are similar 
to those you can find for the other 
Geometry shapes — with a couple of 
additions, shown in Figure 1-14:
 
✓ Defined Proportions: When you 
use this option, Photoshop limits 
any shapes created by using this 
new custom shape to the propor-
tions you use when you create 
it now. That is, you can change 
the size of a new shape, but only 
in proportion with the original 
custom shape you create.
 
✓ Defined Size: When you use this option, Photoshop limits any shapes 
generated based on this new custom shape to the size you set now.
Creating your own custom shape
You can create your own custom shape by defining the shape by using a 
vector mask, work path, or saved path. You can find out more about creat-
ing work paths and saved paths in Book III, Chapter 2. To create a shape and 
add it to your shape library, follow these steps:
 
 1. Select the Pen tool from the Tools panel or press Shift+P until the Pen 
tool is selected.
 
2. Select the Shape Layers icon on the Options bar and use the Pen to 
draw the shape you want to create.
 
 Book III, Chapter 2 describes the techniques for adding, removing, and 
adjusting the shapes of curves with the Pen tool.
 
 Photoshop automatically places the shape you create in its own shape 
layer as a vector mask. Find out more about what you can do with a 
vector mask in the following section.
Figure 1-14: You can size your shape 
without losing its original proportions by 
checking the Defined Proportions option.

3. In the Paths panel, select the path or vector mask you want to convert 
into a custom shape.
 
4. Choose Edit➪Define Custom Shape from the menu bar.
 
 The Shape Name dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 1-15.
 
5. Enter a descriptive name for your new shape in the dialog box and 
then click OK.
 
 The new shape appears in the custom shapes pop-up panel on the 
Options bar.
 
6. Select Save Shapes from the Shapes panel’s pop-up menu to store your 
new library on your hard drive.
 
Although you can’t create a shape with the Preset Manager, you can use the 
Preset Manager to manage the shapes in your shape library.
Figure 1-15: Create your own shapes when you tire of the presets.
Using vector masks
When you create a shape in Shape Layer mode, Photoshop automatically 
saves the shape as a vector mask. Essentially, a shape layer has two compo-
nents. First, Photoshop entirely fills the layer with color. Then, Photoshop 
places the shape, which (again) is comprised of a path, on top. The thumb-
nails in the Layers panel visually display this concept. The color peeks 
through the outline of the shape, and Photoshop hides (or masks) the rest 
of the layer. So, in other words, vector masks clip away the color of a shape 
layer. If you delete a vector mask, you’re left with just a layer of solid color.
 
Like all vector objects, vector paths print at the full resolution of the printer 
and are resolution-independent.
You can edit a shape that Photoshop has saved as a vector mask at any time. 
Simply click the vector mask thumbnail to select it. Then, use the Shape and 
Pen tools to edit the shape.
Here are some additional things you can do with a vector mask:
 
✓ To remove a vector mask, drag its thumbnail in the Layers panel to the 
trash can icon at the bottom of the panel. You can also select the layer 
and choose Layer➪Vector Mask➪Delete.

306
Drawing with Vector Shapes
 
✓ To enable or disable a vector mask, Shift-click its thumbnail in the Layers 
panel, or select the layer and choose Layer➪Vector Mask➪Disable 
(or Enable). Photoshop marks the thumbnails of disabled vector 
masks with an X.
 
✓ You can convert a vector mask to a layer mask by selecting the layer 
and choosing Layer➪Rasterize➪Vector Mask.
 
Version CS4 has given you an additional tool to refine masks — both vector 
and pixel. Choose Window➪Masks to bring up the new panel. Move the 
Feather slider to soften the edges of your hard-edged vector mask. Drag the 
Density slider to control the opacity of the areas outside the vector mask. 
For more details on this great new panel, see Book VI, Chapter 3.
Manipulating shapes
You can manipulate shapes you create by using a variety of tools. Here’s a 
quick list of the things you can do:
 
✓ Move: Select the Move tool (press V) to move shapes in their layer.
 
✓ Delete: Select a shape and press Delete to remove it.
 
✓ Adjust anchor points: Use the Direct Selection tool to manipulate 
anchor points, directional handles, lines, and curves.
 
✓ Transform shapes: Choose Edit➪Transform Path or with the Move tool 
selected, select the Show Transform Controls option on the Options bar 
to transform shapes. For more information, see Book III, Chapter 3.
 
✓ Align and distribute shapes: Use active buttons on the Options bar 
when you have the Move tool selected to change alignment and distribu-
tion along an imaginary line (shown on the button).
 
✓ Clone a shape: Hold down Alt (Option on the Mac) and move the shape 
with the Path Selection tool.
You can find more information on manipulating shapes in Book III, Chapter 2.
 
Remember that if you select the Fill Pixels option on the Options bar, you’re 
stuck with limited editing capabilities.

Chapter 2: Filling and Stroking
In This Chapter
✓ Filling and stroking selections or paths
✓ Building and applying gradients
✓ Creating and applying patterns
P
hotoshop offers several ways to create elements, such as geometric 
shapes, out of pixels, and filling and stroking them are two of the 
most venerable commands at your disposal. You can also paint geometric 
elements on your canvas by hand or convert vector shapes to pixels (see 
Book IV, Chapter 1 for more on that topic). But if you need pixels arranged 
into regular circles, ellipses, and polygons, the Fill and Stroke facilities of 
Photoshop are worthy of your consideration.
Here’s how they work:
 
✓ The Fill command adds color or a pattern to a 
selection of any shape or form you’ve created.
 
✓ The Stroke command applies color around the 
selection outline only.
This chapter shows you how to create these 
objects by filling and stroking selections and 
paths, how to add smooth gradient blends, and 
the best ways to apply patterns. After reading 
this chapter, you’ll have your fill of different 
strokes.
 
Another way of filling is by using a fill layer, which you 
can use to fill a shape. Because fill layers work a little 
differently from the types of fills discussed in this chapter, I 
cover them in Book V, Chapter 1.
Filling a Selection with a Solid Color
When you just want to add a solid color, you use either the foreground or 
background color. (These colors appear at the bottom of the Tools panel, 
as I explain in Book I, Chapter 2.) The following steps show you the basics 

308
Filling Options and Tips
of filling a selection with either the foreground or background color (you 
have plenty of other filling options, which I discuss in the following 
sections):
 
1. Create your selection on a layer.
 
 See Book III for all you need to know about selections and Book V for the 
scoop on layers.
 
2. Select a fill color as the foreground or background color.
 
 Choose Window➪Color. In the Color panel, use the color sliders to mix 
your desired color. For more on choosing color, see Book II, Chapter 3.
 
3. Choose Edit➪Fill.
 
 The Fill dialog box, shown in Figure 2-1, 
appears. In this dialog box, under Contents, 
you can select whether to fill with the fore-
ground or background color. You also can 
select Color (which launches the Color 
Picker), Black, 50% Gray, White, History, or 
Pattern.
 
4. Click OK.
 
 The color that you chose fills the selection.
 
You can also select a blend mode, the opacity of the fill, and whether to fill 
the entire selection or only portions of the selection that contain pixels (the 
nontransparent areas). I recommend not adjusting your Blending Mode or 
Opacity settings in the Fill dialog box, but instead creating a new layer for 
your fill and adjusting those settings in the Layers panel, where you have 
more flexibility. For all you need to know about layers, check out Book V.
Filling Options and Tips
After you make a selection, you’re ready to use one of the filling options. You 
can use the Fill dialog box (as described in the preceding section) to fill the 
selection with the foreground or background color; you can also choose to 
fill the selection with color, black, white, or gray. Photoshop is full of short-
cuts and options. Here are just a few:
 
✓ With the selection active, press Alt+Backspace (Option+Delete on the 
Mac) to fill it with the foreground color. All areas within the selection, 
including transparent areas, fill with the color.
 
✓ Fill only the pixels in a selection with the foreground color, leaving any 
transparent pixels transparent, by pressing Alt+Shift+Backspace (or 
Option+Shift+Delete on the Mac). For more on transparency, see Book V, 
Chapter 1.
Figure 2-1: You can fill your 
selection with color, history, 
or a pattern.

Book IV
Chapter 2
Filling and 
Stroking
Filling Options and Tips
 
 Lock the transparent pixels in a layer (and its selections) by clicking the 
Transparency icon in the Lock area of the Layers panel.
 
✓ If you’re working on the Background layer, you can also fill the selection 
with the background color by pressing the Backspace (Delete on the 
Mac) key. (Pressing Backspace/Delete on other layers creates a trans-
parent area that shows the image in the layer underneath the selection.)
 
✓ By selecting the Color option in the Fill dialog box, you access the Color 
Picker where you can select any color of the rainbow to fill your selec-
tion with. For more on using the Color Picker, see Book II, Chapter 3.
 
✓ Select the Pattern option in the Fill dialog box to fill the selection with a 
pattern. Click the arrow next to the pattern swatch and select a pattern 
from the pop-up panel. Click the Pattern panel pop-up menu to select 
more pattern libraries.
 
✓ Select the History option in the Fill dialog box to restore the selection to 
a state or snapshot of the image. For more on working with the History 
panel, see Book II, Chapter 4.
 
✓ Paint part or all the interior of the selection by using any of the Brush 
tools, as shown in Figure 2-2. This option lets you partially fill a selection 
by using a bit of flexibility and creativity. When you paint a selection by 
using Brush tools, Photoshop confines the paint inside the boundaries 
of your selection. For more on painting, see Book IV, Chapter 1.
 
✓ Pour color from the Paint Bucket tool into the selection.

Pouring with the Paint Bucket Tool
Pouring with the Paint Bucket Tool
The Paint Bucket tool, available in the Tools panel (where it shares a flyout 
menu with the Gradient tool), operates much like a combination of the Brush 
tool and the Magic Wand tool, as you can see by looking over its options. 
To use it, select the tool (press Shift+G until it’s active) and click inside 
the selection you want to fill. Here are your options, all of which are on the 
Options bar:
 
✓ Fill: You can select whether to fill with the foreground color or a 
pattern.
 
✓ Pattern: When you select Pattern from the Options bar, you can select 
a preset pattern, load patterns from your pattern libraries, or create a 
pattern of your own. You can find more information on patterns in the 
section “Working with Patterns,” later in this chapter.
 
✓ Mode: You can select a fill blend mode, too. You can find more informa-
tion on these modes in Book V, Chapter 3.
 
✓ Opacity: Adjust this value to make your fill semitransparent.
 
✓ Tolerance: Like the Magic Wand tool, you can choose a Tolerance level 
(0 to 255) that specifies how similar in color a pixel must be before it’s 
selected for painting. You can find more information on Tolerance levels 
in Book III, Chapter 1.
 
✓ Anti-Alias: Choose this option to blend the paint in smoothly with the 
areas not filled.
 
✓ Contiguous: When selected, the paint fills only pixels that are touching 
within your selection. When deselected, paint fills all pixels within the 
Tolerance level that you specify within your selection.
 
✓ All Layers: This option applies paint based on the colors in all layers 
that are within the selection and Tolerance level you specify.
 
Like with other tools that fill, you can prevent the Paint Bucket tool from 
filling the transparent pixels. Just select the Transparency icon in the Lock 
area of the Layers panel.
Stroking a Selection
Stroking enables you to create outlines of selections, layers, or paths. 
Stroking a selection creates a border around the selection. It’s up to you to 
decide whether to put the border inside, outside, or centered on the selec-
tion. (Photoshop doesn’t care.)

Stroking
Stroking a Selection
To stroke a selection, follow these steps:
 
1. In the Tools or Colors panel, choose a foreground color and make a 
selection of your choice.
 
2. Choose Edit➪Stroke.
 
3. In the Stroke dialog box, adjust the settings and the options, as shown 
in Figure 2-3:
Figure 2-3: Apply strokes to your selection up to 250 pixels wide.
 
• Width: You can select 1 to 250 pixels. You can also type a value by 
using another measurement, such as inches, but Photoshop converts 
it to pixel values before applying.
 
• Color: Click in the Color box to select the hue you want from the 
Color Picker.
 
• Location: Select where Photoshop should apply the stroke in rela-
tion to your selection border. Note that the Inside option always 
gives you sharp corners on a rectangle. The Center and Outside 
options can result in blunt corners.

312
Working with Gradients
 
• Mode: This determines how the stroke color merges with other 
colors on the same layer.
 
• Opacity: The default value is 100%. If you want the stroke to be semi-
transparent, type another value.
 
• Preserve Transparency: Select this option to apply the stroke only 
to nontransparent pixels.
 
4. Click OK to apply the stroke.
 
I recommend leaving the Blending Mode and Opacity setting options in the 
Stroke dialog box alone. Instead of adjusting these settings, create a new layer 
for your stroke and then choose different Blending Mode and Opacity settings 
in the Layers panel. This approach maximizes your ability to make edits.
Working with Gradients
A gradient is a wonderful blend of colors that you can apply to a layer or 
selection, gradually fading from one hue to another. Gradients can involve 
more than two colors, producing a veritable rainbow of variations. You can 
apply gradients by using preset selections of colors, or you can create your 
own gradient.
You can create the following gradient effects:
 
✓ Foreground to background: A transition from the current foreground 
color to the background color.
 
✓ Foreground to transparent: A transition from the current foreground 
color to transparent, allowing whatever’s under the transparent portion 
to show through.
 
✓ Black to white: A transition from black to white.
 
✓ An array of colorful selections: Including rainbows, coppery sheens, 
and other effects.
 
You can load other libraries of gradients from the Gradient panel menu’s librar-
ies. They have names such as Color Harmonies, Metals, and Special Effects. For 
more information on managing preset libraries, see Book I, Chapter 5.
In addition to being able to control the appearance and application of a gra-
dient, you also have the opportunity to adjust the Gradient tool’s options, all 
of which are on the Options bar:
 
✓ Mode: Select any of Photoshop’s blending modes.
 
✓ Opacity: Select how transparent the gradient is.
 
✓ Reverse: Reverse the order in which the colors are applied.

313

Working with Gradients
 
✓ Dither: Add noise, or random information, to produce a smoother gradi-
ent that prints with less banding (color stripes caused by the limitations 
of the printing process to reproduce a full range of colors).
 
✓ Transparency: This option determines whether Photoshop ignores the 
gradient’s transparency settings when you apply a gradient. If you dese-
lect this option, all portions of the gradient are fully opaque. I show you 
how to work with a gradient’s transparency in the section ”Adding trans-
parency to a gradient,” later in this chapter.
Applying a preset gradient to a selection
Here’s how to apply a preset gradient:
 
1. Select the layer from the Layers panel and/or make the selection that 
you want to apply the gradient to.
 
 2. Select the Gradient tool from the Tools panel, or press G or Shift+G 
until the Gradient tool becomes active.
 
3. Select one of the preset gradients from the Gradient Picker drop-down 
menu on the Options bar.
 
4. Select the gradient type by clicking one of 
the icons on the Options bar.
 
 Figure 2-4 illustrates each gradient type:
 
• Linear: Blends the colors of the gradient 
from start color to end color in a straight 
line
 
• Radial: Blends the colors outward in a cir-
cular pattern
 
• Angle: Creates a counterclockwise sweep 
around the starting point, resembling a 
radar screen
 
• Reflected: Blends the colors by using sym-
metrical linear gradients on either side of 
the starting point
 
• Diamond: Blends the colors outward in a 
diamond pattern
 
5. Choose any other options you want from the 
Options bar.
 
 I explain these options in the section “Working with Gradients,” earlier 
in this chapter.
 
6. Place the cursor at the position in the layer or selection where you 
want to place the starting color of the gradient.
Figure 2-4: You can choose 
from five gradients.

314
Working with Gradients
 
7. Drag in any direction to the point you want to place the end color.
 
 Longer drags result in a subtle transition between colors, whereas 
shorter drags result in a more abrupt transition. Press the Shift key 
while dragging to restrain the direction of the gradient to an even 
45-degree angle, as well as perfectly horizontal or vertical.
 
8. Release the mouse button to apply the gradient.
 
 The gradient I created is shown in Figure 2-5.
Figure 2-5: Indulge your love of color with Photoshop gradients.
Customizing and editing gradients
Although Photoshop includes dozens of different gradient presets, you may 
want to create your own. Perhaps you want to create a gradient with your 
company colors or build one to match the predominant colors in an image. 
Or you might want to create a gradient that includes more than two colors. 
The Gradient Editor lets you create your own gradient preset, using as many 
colors as you want, which you can save and reuse at any time.
The Gradient Editor has a lot of options, but it’s easy to use when you know 
what all the controls and options do. Follow these steps to create a simple 
smooth gradient:
 
1. Select the Gradient tool from the Tools panel.
 
2. Click in the gradient sample window itself (not the arrow) on the 
Options bar.
 
 The Gradient Editor dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 2-6.

Figure 2-6: The Gradient Editor enables you to create custom gradients.
 
3. Pick an existing gradient preset from the Presets area to use as the 
basis for your new gradient.
 
4. Select Solid or Noise from the Gradient Type pop-up menu.
 
 As soon as you start to edit the existing gradient, the name of the gra-
dient changes to Custom. A Noise gradient is one containing random 
colors. Because the colors are random, each time you create a noise gra-
dient, the result is different. If you choose Noise, you can select which 
color mode to use and how rough the gradient is, and select a range of 
acceptable colors.
 
5. Adjust the Smoothness slider.
 
 Click and drag the slider (click the right-pointing arrow) or enter a value 
to determine how smoothly to blend your colors into one another.
 
 If you choose Noise in Step 4, the slider changes to Roughness. This 
option affects how smoothly or abruptly one color transitions into 
another.
 
6. You can set the following options only if you choose Noise in Step 4:
 
• Color Model: Select your desired color model or limit the range of 
colors by adjusting the sliders. See Book II, Chapter 2 for more 
on color models.

316
Working with Gradients
 
• Restrict Colors: Limits the colors to printable CMYK colors only. 
Again, see Book II, Chapter 2 for details.
 
• Add Transparency: Lets you include transparency in your gradient, 
if desired.
 
• Randomize: Changes the colors in your gradient. Each time you click 
Randomize, you get a new set of colors.
 
7. To begin defining the color of the starting point for your gradient, first 
click the left color stop button under the gradient bar.
 
 The triangle above the stop turns black to indicate you’re working with 
the starting point of the gradient. Because Noise gradients are random, 
you can’t define the colors.
 
8. Select the starting color by using one of these methods:
 
• Double-click the left color stop and select a color from the Color 
dialog box that appears.
 
• Click the Color box in the Stops area of the dialog box and choose a 
color from the Select Stop Color dialog box that opens.
 
• Select Foreground, Background, or User Color from the Color pop-up 
menu in the Stops area of the Gradient Editor dialog box.
 
 If you select color with the Foreground or Background option, the 
color in the gradient changes automatically when you change the 
foreground or background color. The change doesn’t affect any gra-
dients you’ve already created, but it does affect any future gradients. 
However, when you open the Gradient Editor again, you can revert to 
the original foreground or background color you used when you cre-
ated the gradient by selecting the User Color option from the Color 
pop-up menu in the Stops area.
 
• Position the cursor (it appears as an eyedropper icon) anywhere in 
the gradient bar to select a start color from the bar, or position the 
cursor anywhere within an image on your screen and then click to 
select the color under the cursor.
 
9. Click the end point color stop at the right side of the gradient bar and 
use any of the methods described in Step 8 to choose the end color of 
the gradient.
 
10. Change the location of the start and end points of the colors by 
moving the color stops to the left or right. Click and drag the midpoint 
slider (a diamond icon that appears when click on an adjacent color 
stop) to adjust where the colors mix equally, 50-50.
 
 You can also change the position of the midpoint by typing a value into 
the Location box. The position of the color stops can also be changed 
this way.

317
Book IV
Chapter 2
Filling and

Working with Gradients
 
 Because the center point of the gradient is halfway between the start 
and end points, the gradient proceeds smoothly from one color to the 
other, meeting to blend evenly in the middle. Moving the color stops and 
the midpoint changes the proportions.
 
11. (Optional) Want to add another color? Just click below the gradient 
bar at the position you want to add the next color, then define a color 
for the new color stop.
 
12. (Optional) Repeat Step 11 for additional colors.
 
 Heck, you can keep going like this for hours.
 
13. For the additional color stops, move the stops to the left or right to 
adjust the location of the start and end points for each color. Then, 
adjust the midpoint sliders between the colors.
 
14. If you change your mind, you can redefine the color or click the 
Delete button.
 
 You can also remove a color stop by dragging it down or up from its 
position on the gradient bar.
 
15. After your edits are complete, give your gradient a Name, if you want, 
and click the New button.
 
 Your gradient is added to the Presets menu. Figure 2-7 shows an exam-
ple of a unique gradient that I created in the Gradient Editor.
Figure 2-7: The Gradient Editor gives you more creative license than the presets.

Working with Gradients
Adding transparency to a gradient
By default, a gradient has 100-percent opacity in the start color and pro-
gresses to 100-percent opacity in the end color. If you like, you can have the 
gradient fade out to transparency so that the portion of the image under 
the gradient shows through. To add transparency to a gradient, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Create a gradient, as described in the preceding sections.
 
2. Select the left opacity stop.
 
 This stop is located just above the gradient bar, as shown in Figure 2-8.
Opacity stop
Opacity slider
Figure 2-8: Lighten your gradients by adjusting the opacity of your colors.
 
3. Use the Opacity slider to specify the amount of transparency for the 
gradient at its start point.
 
 You can also type a value into the Opacity box.

319
Book IV
Chapter 2
Filling and 
Stroking
Working with Gradients
 
4. Select the right opacity stop, and then slide the Opacity slider or enter 
a percentage in the text box to specify transparency for the gradient 
at its end point.
 
 The lower the percentage, the less opaque the color.
 
5. Move the opacity stops to the right or left to adjust the location where 
Photoshop applies each stop’s opacity setting.
 
6. Move the midpoint slider (a diamond icon) to adjust how the color 
and the transparency mix.
 
7. Click above the gradient bar to add more opacity stops if you want to 
vary the transparency of the gradient at different points.
 
 For example, you could fade transparency from 100 percent to 50 per-
cent and back to 100 percent to produce a particular effect. Figure 2-9 
shows a gradient with varying levels of transparency.
Figure 2-9: Transparency gives a gradient a different look.
 
Gradients ordinarily proceed smoothly from one color to another. If you want 
a less homogeneous appearance, adjust the Smoothness slider to a value of 
less than 100 percent (click the right-pointing arrow to access the slider).

320
Working with Patterns
Managing and Saving Gradients
If you’re smart, you’ll want to store the gradients you create so that you can 
use or edit them again later. Before you can save them, however, be sure and 
add them to the gradient Presets (see “Customizing and editing gradients” 
earlier in this chapter). Here are some tips for managing your gradients:
 
✓ To save a gradient, click the Save button in the Gradient Editor dialog 
box. You save the current presets, including your new gradient, under 
the current library’s name or another one that you choose.
 
✓ To load gradient presets into the Gradient Editor, click the Load button 
and select the name of the gradient library that you want to add to the 
Presets list.
 
✓ To add an additional set of presets to the current presets, select the 
name of the presets from the Gradient Editor’s pop-up menu.
For more information about managing gradient presets with the Preset 
Manager, see Book I, Chapter 5.
Working with Patterns
Patterns are textures or repeating configurations of pixels that you can use to 
fill selections or layers, apply with painting tools, smear around your image 
with the Pattern Stamp tool, or use as a basis for the Healing Brush and Patch 
tools. Photoshop offers a large selection of patterns; you can download an 
even larger selection, and you can even create your own in two different ways.
You select patterns from panels that appear on the Options bar for many 
of the tools just mentioned, much like brush tips and gradients, and you 
manage them in much the same way, using the Preset Manager (see Book I, 
Chapter 5). The following sections show you how to apply a preset pattern 
and create your own.
Applying a preset pattern
Although you can apply patterns by using many different tools, this chapter 
sticks with applying patterns as fills. To fill a layer or selection with a preset 
pattern, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose the layer from the Layers panel and/or make the selection you 
want to fill with a pattern.
 
2. Choose Edit➪Fill and select Pattern from the Use pop-up menu.

321

3. In the Custom Pattern panel, select the pattern you want to fill with.
 
 Here are some tips in choosing a pattern:
 
• Choose a pattern from the drop-down panel, as shown in Figure 2-10.
 
• Replace the current patterns with new patterns by selecting Replace 
Patterns from the panel pop-up menu (click the right-pointing arrow 
on the right side of the dialog box). Then, select the new pattern 
library from the dialog box that appears.
 
• Append new patterns to the current set by selecting Load Patterns 
from the panel pop-up menu.
 
• Append one of the preset libraries that come with Photoshop by 
selecting the pattern from the list at the bottom of the panel pop-up 
menu.

Working with Patterns
 
4. Choose any other fill options you want to apply, such as Mode, 
Opacity, or Preserve Transparency.
 
 The Preserve Transparency option prevents Photoshop from filling the 
transparent areas on your layer with a pattern.
 
 I recommend adjusting the Mode and Opacity settings in the Layers 
panel rather than the Fill dialog box. This approach allows you the maxi-
mum flexibility if you want to make edits later.
 
5. Click OK to fill the layer or selection with the chosen pattern.
Creating a new pattern
You can create your own pattern, basing it on an existing image or one you 
create yourself. Select a small portion of an image to build an abstract pat-
tern or use a recognizable object to define that object as a pattern stamp. 
You can use anything, from a logo to your signature, as a pattern.
To create your own pattern, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the image that contains the area you want to use as a pattern or 
create an image from scratch.
 
2. Make any modifications to the image to produce the exact pattern that 
you want.
 
 3. Use the Rectangular Marquee tool to select the area you want to con-
vert into a pattern.
 
 If you don’t make a selection, Photoshop uses your entire image as a 
basis for the pattern.
 
 If you’re using a selection to define your pattern, you must use a rectan-
gular selection. You can’t use a feathered selection of any kind.
 
4. Choose Edit➪Define Pattern.
 
5. Enter a name for your pattern in the Define Pattern dialog box.
 
 Your new pattern appears in the Pattern panel for use.

P
hotoshop has morphed into a surprisingly good tool for 
creating type used in images. Over time, features 
have been added that let you create paragraphs of text 
or simple lines of text used as headlines or labels. 
You can change the spacing between characters, 
warp your type, check your spelling, or create 
selections in the shape of text. Drop shadows, 
beveled type, and other special effects are yours 
quickly and easily. And you can even place text 
on or inside a path.
You may still want to use Adobe Illustrator or 
InDesign to create professional layouts in which 
you can keep text and image files separate, or 
where you have to place buckets full of text at small 
point sizes. But if what you’re looking for is a great-
looking image that includes great-looking snippets of text, 
Photoshop can do the job. This chapter introduces you to 
Photoshop’s basic type tools, as well as its more advanced type capabilities.

Understanding Different Kinds of Type
Selecting a Type Mode
The text you create in Photoshop can be categorized in several different 
ways, but ultimately, you’re either adding just a little text (such as a word 
or single line of text) or a lot (maybe a paragraph or so). Accordingly, 
Photoshop separates type into two modes:
 
✓ Point type: Use this mode to create a headline or label. You can create 
point type by clicking in your image and typing; the line appears while 
you type and grows to whatever length you need (even if that length is 
wider or taller than your image). Point type never wraps around to a 
new line. To wrap to the next line, you must insert a hard return.
 
✓ Paragraph type: Use this mode to enter longer blocks of text on an 
image. It’s (unsurprisingly) similar to the kind of type you’re accus-
tomed to working with in word processing programs. In Paragraph 
mode, all the text goes into a resizable bounding box, and if a line is too 
long, Photoshop automatically wraps it around to the next line.
The Point type and Paragraph type modes each operate a bit differently, 
although they share many features and options. I explain each of them sepa-
rately in the sections “Entering Text in Point Type Mode” and “Entering Text 
in Paragraph Type Mode,” later in this chapter.
Understanding Different Kinds of Type
Whether you’re using Point type mode or Paragraph type mode, you can 
select several type options, each designed to help you work with, display, 
print, and edit text. These options determine how Photoshop enables you to 
work with text in a file:
 
✓ Vector type: All text in Photoshop is initially created as vector type. 
Vector type provides scalable outlines that you can resize without 
producing jaggy edges in the diagonal strokes. You can also edit type 
in this mode, adding or subtracting characters or adjusting attributes, 
such as kerning and tracking. Vector type is always of optimum quality 
and appears crisp and clean. (See Book II, Chapter 2 for more details on 
vector and rasterized images.)
 
✓ Rasterized type: When Photoshop converts vector type into pixels, that 
text is rasterized. When text is rasterized, it’s no longer editable; instead, 
it’s a frozen graphic of what the text looks like. When you finish editing 
vector type and want to merge the text with the other pixels in an image 
(or to perform some manipulations that can be done only with raster-
ized text, such as applying filters), you can transform the vector type 
into pixels by rasterizing it. You can’t resize rasterized type without 
losing some quality or risking a bad case of the jaggies.

Editing Type
Exploring the Type Tools
 
✓ Pixel fonts: Pixel fonts are tiny 
fonts designed for display at small 
sizes on computer screens, espe-
cially Web sites. Pixel fonts are 
designed so that every pixel cor-
responds to a pixel on your screen. 
These fonts, with names such as 
MINI 7, MiniSerif, and Tenacity, are 
created in fixed sizes (say, 7 pixels 
high for MINI 7 or 10 pixels high for 
Tenacity and PixelDust). Diagonal 
lines are avoided as much as possi-
ble, with the font designs favoring 
horizontal and vertical strokes. As 
a result, pixel fonts look crisp and 
clear at small sizes without anti-aliasing (smoothing around the edges). 
Indeed, you shouldn’t use anti-aliasing with pixel fonts, nor should you 
attempt to resize or rescale them. You can buy or download pixel fonts, 
install them on your computer, and use them just like you use other 
fonts. You can see some examples of pixel fonts in Figure 3-1.
Exploring the Type Tools
Strictly speaking, Photoshop has four type tools (found in the Tools panel), 
but two of them are simply vertically oriented versions of the main two text 
implements. You can use either Paragraph or Point type mode with any of 
the type tools:
 
✓ Horizontal Type: Use this tool to enter point or paragraph type 
oriented horizontally on your screen. If you want text that’s ori-
ented at an angle other than vertical, you can rotate it by choosing 
Edit➪Transform➪Rotate after you enter the text. This tool creates the 
type on its own type layer, except when used in Bitmap, Multichannel, 
or Indexed Color modes, which don’t support layers. (Book II, Chapter 2 
covers these modes.)
 
✓ Vertical Type: The Vertical Type and Vertical Type Mask tools 
(described in the following bullet) are handy for entering Asian charac-
ters. However, you can also use this tool to enter Roman character point 
type oriented in a vertical column. You can also use the Vertical Type 
tool to create columns of paragraph text, but the results look a little 
strange. After you enter your text columns, you can rotate the text to 
an orientation other than vertical by choosing Edit➪Transform➪Rotate. 
Like the Horizontal Type tool, this tool creates type in its own type 
layer, except with file modes that don’t support layers.
Figure 3-1: Unlike traditional fonts, pixel 
fonts are designed to fit into the pixel grid 
of your screen.

326
Entering Text in Point Type Mode
 
✓ Horizontal Type Mask/Vertical Type Mask: These tools operate iden-
tically to their siblings described in the two preceding bullets, with 
two exceptions. Instead of adding filled type, both the Horizontal and 
Vertical Type Mask tools create a selection border in the shape of the 
type you enter. Both tools add a selection marquee to the current active 
layer. You can do anything with a type selection that you can do with 
any other selection, including saving it (Select➪Save Selection) for reuse 
later. You can find a longer discussion of the type mask tools in the sec-
tion “Creating type outlines,” later in this chapter.
The Horizontal and Vertical Type tools have some interesting options, which 
I explain in the following section. You can also set controls in the Paragraph 
and Character panels, which I discuss in the sections “Working with the 
Character Panel” and “Working with the Paragraph Panel,” later in this 
chapter.
Entering Text in Point Type Mode
If you’re image oriented (and why wouldn’t you be if you’re using Photoshop?), 
you’re probably not planning to include a novella with your graphics.
Point type is great for headlines, labels, and similar small amounts of text. 
You can also use it to create logos and headings for Web pages. The Web is 
one place where text that isn’t tack-sharp can still do the job.
 
Although a Photoshop image is generally not the place you want to insert a 
whole lot of text, you can add larger blocks of text that are professional and 
effective — read the section “Entering Text in Paragraph Type Mode,” later 
in this chapter. You can modify how point type and paragraph type are dis-
played by using the Paragraph and Character panels.
To enter point type, just follow these steps:
 
1. Open a saved image or create a new Photoshop document.
 
 2. Select either the Horizontal or Vertical Type tool from the Tools panel, 
or press T to select the type tool if the one you want is visible.
 
 Press the Shift+T to cycle through the four available type tools until the 
one that you want is active.
 
 Your cursor looks like an I-beam, similar to the one you see in a word 
processing program.
 
3. Click the area of the image where you want to insert the text.
 
 Where you click is called the insertion point.

327
Book IV
Chapter 3
Creating and 
Editing Type
Entering Text in Paragraph Type Mode
 
 A small horizontal line about one-third of the way up the I-beam shows 
where the baseline (on which the line of text rests) is for horizon-
tal type. If you select the Vertical Type tool, the cursor is rotated 90 
degrees. The baseline is centered in the I-beam and represents the 
center axis of the vertical column of text you type.
 
4. Select any of the type options from the Options bar, Character panel, 
or Paragraph panel.
 
 To access the panels, click the Character and Paragraph toggle button 
on the Options bar or select either panel on the Window menu.
 
 I describe these options in the sections, “Working with the Character 
Panel” and “Working with the Paragraph Panel,” later in this chapter.
 
5. Type your text. Press Enter (or Return on the Mac) to begin a new line.
 
 Lines of point type don’t wrap around. When you press Enter or Return, 
you’re inserting a hard carriage return that doesn’t move. You have to 
remove hard returns if you want to change the length of the lines you 
type.
 
6. When you finish entering the text, click the Commit (the check mark 
icon) button on the Options bar.
 
 A new type layer with your text is created. The layer appears in your 
Layers panel, as indicated by the T icon.
Entering Text in Paragraph Type Mode
Paragraphs are best allocated to captions or text descriptions that accom-
pany an image. Large amounts of text in an image don’t look their best 
because when you rasterize the type, even the most carefully entered text 
may have a fuzzy look.
Paragraph type is similar to the text you enter in a word processing pro-
gram, except that it’s contained inside a border, called a text box or a bound-
ing box. While you type into a text box, the lines of text wrap around to fit 
the dimensions of the box. If you resize the box, Photoshop adjusts the 
wrapped ends to account for the new size.
You can type multiple paragraphs, use typographical controls, and rotate or 
scale the type. You can easily resize paragraph type (and point type, too) by 
entering a new point size value in the Character dialog box without having 
to reselect all the text. Just make sure the text layer is selected in the Layers 
panel and the Text tool is active. This approach works for all the other text 
characteristics, as well.

328
Entering Text in Paragraph Type Mode
To enter paragraph type, follow these steps:
 
1. Open a saved image or create a new Photoshop document.
 
2. Select either the Horizontal or Vertical Type tool from the Tools panel, 
or press T to select the type tool if the one you want is active.
 
 Press the Shift+T to cycle through the four available type tools until the 
one you want is active.
 
 Your cursor looks like an I-beam, similar to the one you see in a word 
processing program.
 
3. Insert and size the text box by using one of the following methods:
 
• Drag to create a text box of an arbitrary size. After you release the 
mouse button, you can drag any of the handles at the corners and 
sides of the box to customize the size.
 
• Hold down the Alt (Option on the Mac) key and drag a box of any 
size. The Paragraph Text Size dialog box appears. You can enter the 
exact dimensions of the box you want to create. When you click OK, 
a bounding box of the size you specified appears, complete with 
handles for resizing the box later, if you want.
 
4. Select the type options you want from the Options bar, or Character or 
Paragraph panel.
 
5. Enter your text. To start a new paragraph, press Enter (Return on 
the Mac).
 
 Each line wraps around to fit inside the bounding box, as you can see in 
Figure 3-2.
Figure 3-2: Paragraph text automatically wraps 
to conform to your bounding box.

Creating Type on or in a Path
 
 If you type more text than fits in the text box, an overflow icon (plus 
sign) appears in the bottom-right handle. You can resize the text box by 
gripping any of the eight handles and dragging.
 
6. Click the Commit button on the Options bar (the button looks like a 
check mark).
 
 Photoshop creates a new type layer.
Creating Type on or in a Path
Photoshop also offers the ability to place type in and on a path. The way 
you create path type in Photoshop is very similar to the way you create path 
type in InDesign and Illustrator. Follow these steps:
 
 1. Grab the Pen or Shape tool. Select the Paths option the Options bar 
and create your path. For more on paths, see Book III, Chapter 2.
 
 You can also copy and paste an existing path, or import a path from 
Illustrator or another compatible drawing program.
 
2. Using the regular Type tool (either Horizontal or Vertical), click on or 
inside the path.
 
 When clicking on the path, your type cursor changes to indicate type on 
a path. If you clicked inside the path and are filling it with type, a bound-
ing box appears.
 
3. Type your desired text and marvel at how the type glides along or 
inside the path, as shown in Figure 3-3.
 
 Commit the type by clicking the Commit button (the check mark) on the 
Options bar. After you commit the type, the path itself doesn’t appear 
unless you stroke or fill it with color, as I did with my smaller heart.
 
4. To adjust the starting (x icon) or ending point (circle icon) for the type 
on a path, click either point with the Path Selection tool and drag the 
type to a new position.
 
5. Edit the text (changing characters, colors, alignment, and so on) just as 
you would with regular type.
 
6. Adjust the path by using any of the path tools — the Direct Selection 
tool, the Convert Point tool, and so on.
 
 The type magically reflows along the newly adjusted path.
 
To create regular point or paragraph type when you click near a path, hold 
down the Shift key when clicking, telling Photoshop you don’t want path type.

330
Using the Options Bar
Figure 3-3: Make a visual statement with your type by putting it on or 
in the path of your choice.
Using the Options Bar
The Options bar contains a group of options, shown in Figure 3-4. Some 
(but not all) of these options are duplicated in the Character panel. Those 
options that appear in both places are the most frequently used options. 
Talk about convenience.
Figure 3-4: The text options on the Options bar.
Your options, from left to right, include
 
✓ Change the Text Orientation: Use this handy button to toggle between 
vertical and horizontal text orientations. Just select the type layer you 
want to transform and with the Type tool selected, click the text orienta-
tion button in the Options bar. This option works with point type and 
paragraph type, although the results you get from switching the para-
graph type to vertical orientation may look odd.

331
Book IV
Chapter 3
Creating and 
Editing Type
Using the Options Bar
 
✓ Font Family: Select the font/typeface you want from the drop-down list.
 
 Photoshop provides you with a WYSIWYG (what you see is what you 
get) font menu. After the font name, the word “sample” is rendered 
in the actual font. You also find one of these abbreviations before 
the font name: a, Adobe Type 1 (PostScript) fonts; TT (TrueType); 
O (OpenType). Those fonts with no abbreviations are Bitmapped 
fonts.
 
✓ Font Style: Some fonts can have additional style, such as light or demi-
bold, and other styles are assigned as separate typefaces. Only the 
styles available for a particular font appear in the list. The font style also 
now supports a WYSIWYG menu.
 
 If a font you want to use doesn’t offer bold or italic style, you can simu-
late either or both by selecting a faux style in the Character panel.
 
✓ Font Size: Select the size of the text from this list or type a size in the 
text box. Generally, text sizes are shown in points, with 72 points equal-
ing approximately 1 inch. (A 36-point font is 1/2 inch in size at 72 pixels 
per inch [ppi].)
 
 If you don’t like points, you can switch to millimeters or pixels in the 
Units and Rulers Preferences dialog box. (You can find instructions for 
doing this in Book I, Chapter 5.)
 
✓ Anti-Aliasing: This list includes four different types of smoothing to 
use on your text, plus none (which leaves your text unsmoothed). For 
small type, try Sharp to avoid your type from being too fuzzy around 
the edges. But the exact results depend on the typeface, so be sure to 
take a gander at your type. Bonus Chapter 1 (on this book’s Web site) 
explains anti-aliasing in detail. See the Introduction for details about the 
Web site.
 
✓ Text Alignment: Three buttons specify whether Photoshop aligns your 
Horizontal Type tool text left, center, or right. When you use the Vertical 
Type tool, the buttons transform into Top, Center (vertically), and 
Bottom choices.
 
✓ Text Color: Click in this box to select a color from the Color Picker.
 
✓ Create Warped Text: This option lets you warp and bend text by using 
15 different types of distortion.
 
✓ Toggle Character and Paragraph Panels: Click this button anytime a 
type tool is active to show or hide the Character and Paragraph panels.
 
✓ Cancel: Click this button (or press the Esc key) to cancel the text entry 
you’re making.
 
✓ Commit: Click this button to apply the text to a type layer.

332
Working with the Character Panel
Working with the Character Panel
The Character panel (shown in Figure 3-5), which 
is usually paired with the Paragraph panel, lets 
you format the appearance of individual type 
characters. Choose Window➪Character or click 
the Character panel icon (capital letter A) in the 
dock. Five of the options in the Character panel are 
exactly the same as those on the Options bar. The 
duplicated features include Font Family, Font Style, 
Font Size, Anti-Aliasing, and Text Color. The other 
menus, buttons, and text boxes provide additional 
functions. I discuss these options in the following 
sections.
Leading
 
 Leading is the amount of space between the baselines of consecutive lines 
of type, usually measured in points. (The baseline is the imaginary line on 
which a line of type rests.) You can select a specific amount of leading or 
allow Photoshop to determine the amount automatically by choosing Auto 
from the Leading menu.
Wider line spacing can make text easier to read (as long as you don’t go over-
board!) or can be used for artistic effect. Tighter line spacing makes for more 
compact text but can decrease readability if your tightening goes too far.
When you select Auto Leading, Photoshop multiplies the type size by a value 
of 120 percent to calculate the leading size. So, Photoshop spaces the base-
lines of 10-point type 12 points apart. You can change this automatic value 
by clicking the Paragraph panel and selecting Justification from the panel’s 
menu. A dialog box appears, containing several values. Type the amount 
you want in the Auto Leading box. If all this seems confusing, I recommend 
experimenting with leading to get a true idea of how various values affect the 
space between lines of text.
Tracking
 
 Tracking is the amount of space between letters in a word, line, or para-
graph. You can specify negative tracking to squeeze all the letters together 
more closely or positive tracking to let them spread out a bit.
 
Don’t confuse tracking with kerning, which deals with the space between two 
individual letters. Tracking sets a value to evenly space all the letters you 
select, and kerning helps you close or widen the gap between two individual 
letters, officially called a letter pair.
Figure 3-5: The Character 
panel offers type specification 
options galore.

333
Book IV
Chapter 3
Creating and 
Editing Type
Working with the Character Panel
One use for tracking is to help lines of text fit a specified horizontal space, 
and you can make this technique work if you use it judiciously. Beginners 
typically overdo tracking, squeezing letters together so tightly they touch, 
or spreading them apart so that wide gaps appear. You can see examples of 
tracking in Figure 3-6.
Figure 3-6: Tracking adjusts the spaces between your selected letters.
To track a set of characters or a line, select the text you want to squeeze 
or expand, and select a value either from 0 to –100 or 0 to 200 from the 
Tracking menu, or type a specific value (from –1000 to 10000) in the Tracking 
text box. Each unit is equal to 1/1,000 of an em (the width of an em dash in a 
particular typeface), so a setting of –100 reduces the space between charac-
ters by 1/10 the width of an em dash (quite a lot!).
Kerning
 
 Kerning is a technique for adding or 
removing space between pairs of letters 
to make them fit together more closely 
and aesthetically. For example, the let-
ters A and V are a natural fit and often 
look better when kerned slightly closer. 
If you select Metrics in your Kerning 
option, Photoshop automatically tries to 
kern the characters to provide an attrac-
tive look, like that shown in Figure 3-7. 
The Optical option kerns a pair of letters 
based on their particular shape. The 
kerning tables are built into the indi-
vidual font. Be warned that cheap fonts 
sometimes have poorly created kern-
ing tables or no tables at all — another 
good reason to stick with quality fonts.
To manually kern letters, click the point between the two characters and 
select a percentage either from 0 to –100 or 0 to 200 from the Kerning menu, 
Original

Figure 3-7: Kerning a pair of letters can 
enhance their appearance.

334
Working with the Character Panel
or type a specific value (from –1000 to 10000) in the Kerning text box. Like 
with the Tracking menu, the values represent 1/1,000 of an em.
Vertical and Horizontal Scale
 
 The Vertical and Horizontal Scale 
options represent the relationship 
between the height and width of the 
text. By default, this relationship is 
100 percent. To make the width of the 
type proportionately 50 percent more 
than the height, enter 150 percent into 
the Horizontal Scale box. You can see 
examples of scaling in Figure 3-8.
 
Be careful about using the Scale options. Type designers create fonts with 
very specific proportions. When you deviate from those proportions, you 
can destroy what was once a beautifully designed typeface.
Baseline shift and text attributes
 
 The Baseline option adjusts the height above or below a typeface’s normal 
baseline. You usually employ this option to create superscripts and sub-
scripts. A bar with several buttons in the Character panel lets you turn on or 
off several type attributes with a single click. Table 3-1 covers the many text 
attributes.
Table 3-1 
Character Panel Text Attributes
Icon
Name
What It Does
Faux Bold
Creates a fake bold. Warning: Applying faux 
styles can distort the proportions of a font. It’s 
really best to use fonts as they were originally 
designed — and if there’s no bold font style, 
c’est la vie.
Faux Italic
Creates a fake italic. Like with faux bold, take 
caution when using this attribute to prevent 
distortion.
All Caps
Changes the case of the characters in 
selected text to all capitals or back to their 
original case when you turn it off.
Small Caps
Creates uppercase letters about the size of 
lowercase letters in a font. Less obtrusive than 
full-size caps in text passages. Photoshop 
either uses the small caps char acters built into 
many fonts or creates faux small caps for you.

Name
What It Does
Superscript
Raises a character automatically to create a 
superscript, as in E=MC2. You probably also 
want to reduce the size of the character.
Subscript
Lowers the character below the baseline, 
creating a subscript. Usually, subscripts are 
reduced in size, as in H2O.
Underline
Underlines the selected characters.
Strikethrough
Provides a strikethrough effect to the 
selected characters. In legal applications, 
strikethrough is widely used to show sections 
that have been removed, but in their original 
context.
Character Set
Selects the language you want to use for 
Photoshop’s spell checker and for hyphen-
ation. The option includes variations, such as 
English: USA or English: UK, and French or 
Canadian French.
You can also find the attributes in Table 3-1 on the Character panel pop-up 
menu. And the menu lists a few other attributes that aren’t displayed 
directly in the panel:
 
✓ Change Text Orientation: Rotates your text horizontally or vertically.
 
✓ Standard Vertical Roman Alignment: Displays the text in the standard 
alignment you’re used to seeing — across the page.
 
✓ Open Type: When you work with OpenType fonts, you may find that 
they include tables of various font attributes. These tables allow you 
to apply various styles, such as true; diagonal fractions; alternate Old 
Style numerals; fancy cursive type uppercase letters (Swash and Titling); 
ligatures (designed to fix the kerning of certain awkward letter combina-
tions, such as fi and tt); and ornamental fonts (think dingbats or wing-
dings), such as leaves and flowers.
 
✓ Fractional Widths: This setting is the default display. When type gets 
small, the spacing between characters may vary by fractions of a pixel. 
Photoshop has to favor one pixel or the other, and sometimes the 
appearance is strange. Overall, however, it provides the best spacing for 
the legibility and appearance of the type. But, for small type to be dis-
played on the Web, the readability may be impaired due to some charac-
ters running together and words having gaps.

336
Working with the Paragraph Panel
 
✓ System Layout: Displays the text by using the operating system’s default 
text handling, similar to what you see in WordPad or TextEdit. This 
option doesn’t allow fractions of pixels and removes any anti-aliasing. 
This is a good option for text to be displayed on the Web.
 
✓ No Break: Prevents words from breaking at the end of lines. You may 
want to select this option to prevent words such as proper names, 
dates, initials, and so forth from breaking. Select your text and then 
select the option.
 
✓ Reset Character: Select this option to reset your character attributes 
(font family, size, style, and so on) back to Photoshop’s default.
Working with the Paragraph Panel
You can use the Paragraph panel, shown in Figure 3-9, to format any or all 
paragraphs in a type layer. Simply select the paragraph or paragraphs that 
you want to format by clicking an individual paragraph with the Type tool. 
You can drag a selection to select multiple paragraphs; or in the Layers 
panel, click a type layer that contains the paragraphs to format all of them at 
the same time.
 
The Paragraph panel’s pop-up menu gives you 
access to Justification and Hyphenation dialog 
boxes. You can use these to customize the default 
settings that Photoshop uses for these functions. 
As a side note, if you’re not familiar with the word 
glyph used in the Justification dialog box, it’s 
another word for a font character.
Changing paragraph alignment
At the top of the Paragraph panel, you see a set of seven alignment buttons. 
Three of these buttons align non-justified text. They include the following:
 
✓ Left Align Text: All text is even with the left margin and allowed to be 
ragged on the right side of the column.
 
✓ Center Text: Text is evenly centered in its column and ragged on both 
right and left edges.
 
✓ Right Align Text: All text is even with the right margin and allowed to be 
ragged on the left side.
 
With vertical type, these choices align the text to the top, a center axis, and 
the bottom of a column.
Figure 3-9: Use the Paragraph 
panel to align and indent your 
text.

Working with the Paragraph Panel
Changing paragraph justification
Four options in the Paragraph panel produce justified text, in which 
Photoshop inserts spaces between characters as necessary so that each 
line is flush on both left and right sides. In addition, you choose to make the 
last line flush left, flush right, centered, or force justified on both sides with 
spaces inserted by Photoshop. This last option sometimes calls for some 
manual tweaking to avoid a final line that’s squeezed or expanded too much. 
You can apply justification options to paragraph type only, not point type.
 
The “rules,” or criteria, that Photoshop uses for creating justified text can 
be found in the Justification dialog box, accessible via the Paragraph panel 
pop-up menu.
For vertical type, the justification choices are Top align, Center, Bottom 
align, or Justify (four options).
Changing paragraph indentation
Three options in the Paragraph panel let you enter an amount of indenta-
tion between the sides of the text bounding box and the actual text. You can 
specify the amount of indentation from the left or right, and for the first line 
of the paragraph (creating a first line that’s indented more than the others in 
the paragraph). For vertical type, the indentations are rotated 90 degrees.
Changing spacing between paragraphs
Two options in the Paragraph panel let you specify the amount of space 
between paragraphs. You can specify the amount of space before every 
paragraph, the amount after every paragraph, or both.
Breaking long words across two lines
The final option in the Paragraph panel is the Hyphenate check box, which 
specifies whether Photoshop hyphenates words that are too long to fit on 
a line or leaves them intact. Turning on hyphenation can prevent awkward 
spacing, particularly with justified text that would otherwise contain a lot 
more spaces between characters to make a line fit.
 
The criteria that Photoshop uses for creating hyphenated text can be found 
in the Hyphenation dialog box, accessible via the Paragraph panel pop-up 
menu.
The Paragraph panel’s pop-up menu has a few additional options:
 
✓ Roman Hanging Punctuation: Controls whether punctuation marks 
(quotations, dashes, colons, and so on) appear inside or outside the 
margins. Select this option to have the punctuation marks appear 
outside.

✓ Adobe Single-Line Composer: Composition includes using a host of 
parameters (such as word and letter spacing, and hyphenation) to deter-
mine where a line should break. This option composes type one line at a 
time and offers more manual control over where lines break. The option 
favors compressing or expanding word spacing over hyphenation, but 
prefers hyphenation over compressing or expanding letter spacing. This 
option is selected by default.
 
✓ Adobe Every-Line Composer: Looks at multiple, possible breaking 
points for a range of lines. The option can optimize earlier lines in the 
paragraph to avoid weird breaks later on in the paragraph. Emphasis 
is given to even spacing of letters and words over hyphenation. This 
option can provide more even spacing and fewer hyphens.
 
✓ Reset Paragraph: Resets all the paragraph attributes back to the 
Photoshop defaults.
Editing Text
You can apply all the options described in this chapter while you enter text, 
or later, when you’re rearranging words or fixing typos and other errors. To 
make changes to the text itself, just follow these steps:
 
1. Open a saved image or create a new Photoshop document.
 
2. Select the appropriate Type tool.
 
3. In the Layers panel, select the existing type layer you want to modify 
or, for a new type layer, click the Type tool in the document.
 
4. To modify existing text, drag the mouse from the insertion point to 
select characters to copy, delete, or format. For new type, begin typing 
at the place you clicked. Press the backspace or delete key as you type 
to eliminate characters. 
 
5. When you’re done entering your changes, click the Commit button.
Finding and replacing text
You can make global changes in a text layer, switching all occurrences of 
a set of characters to another string. For example, you might have typed 
Ghandi a few dozen times before remembering that the Mahatma’s name is 
spelled Gandhi. To replace text, follow these steps:
 
1. Open a saved image or create a new Photoshop document.
 
2. In the Layers panel, select the type layer you want to modify.
 
3. Choose Edit➪Find and Replace Text.

 The Find and Replace Text 
dialog box appears, as shown 
in Figure 3-10.
 
4. Type or paste the text you want to 
replace in the Find What box.
 
5. Enter the replacement text in the 
Change To box.
 
6. (Optional) If you want the search 
to locate only text that exactly 
matches the case of the Find string 
(for example, FREEdom but not Freedom), select the Case Sensitive 
option.
 
7. (Optional) To ignore the search word embedded in another word (say, 
to find the but not there or they), select Whole Word Only.
 
8. Click Find Next.
 
9. When each string is found, select whether you want to
 
• Change: This option changes only the string of text just located. 
Click this button if you’re looking for one particular occurrence.
 
• Change All: This option changes all occurrences of the search text 
with the replacement string in your text.
 
• Change/Find: This option changes the found text and then looks for 
the next occurrence.
Checking your spelling
Photoshop can check your spelling by using an internal dictionary that you 
can update with words of your own. Even though you’re not likely to enter 
huge amounts of text in Photoshop, that’s no excuse for misspelling the 
words that you do include. Indeed, because it’s so difficult to change text 
after you’ve rasterized a text layer, the spell checker can save you a great 
deal of work. Follow these steps to use it:
 
1. Open a saved image containing type layers.
 
2. Make sure that you’ve specified the correct language in the Character 
panel’s Character Set menu.
 
3. Select the text that you want to check or select a type layer, in the 
Layers panel, to check all the text on that layer.
 
4. Choose Edit➪Check Spelling.
 
5. When Photoshop identifies a possible error in the Not in Dictionary 
box, click Change to substitute the recommended correction for the 
word that’s spelled incorrectly.

text with the Find and Replace command.

 Or you can choose from one of these options:
 
• Ignore: Leaves the word alone and continues to check the rest of the 
text.
 
• Ignore All: Ignores all instances of the word for the rest of the spell-
check session.
 
• Suggestions: Select a different word from the Suggestions text box or 
type in the correct spelling yourself.
 
• Change All: Corrects all occurrences of the misspelled word.
 
• Add: Adds the unfamiliar word to Photoshop’s dictionary.
 
 Deselect the Check All Layers option to check only the currently selected 
layer.
 
6. Click Done when you finish.
 
 The Check Spelling dialog box closes.
Masking, Shaping, and Warping Type
You can do a lot more with type than create labels, captions, or paragraphs 
of text. Type can become an integral part of your decorative design, espe-
cially when you stylize, warp, or otherwise transform it in interesting ways.
Your Photoshop text can have character, too, communicating messages with 
more than just words. The text of a beach scene can appear to be wavy, or 
watery and translucent. Halloween type can take on a ghostly or spooky 
appearance. Type can be romantic, otherworldly, cheerful, or comical. It all 
depends on how you create and apply it.
The following sections show you some of the tricks you can perform by 
masking, warping, and shaping your type so that your words come to life 
and add something special to your images.
Playing with type layer opacity
Layers are the stacks of digital overlays on which each of the elements of 
your image reside. (Check out Book V, Chapter 1 for the lowdown on layers.) 
You can change the transparency of a type layer, like you can with any other 
layer in Photoshop, reducing the opacity (transparency) of the type so that 
it allows the underlying layer to show through. Take a look at Figure 3-11, 
which shows type at varying levels of opacity over an image.

Figure 3-11: Varying the opacity of your type is as easy as dragging a slider.
Changing the opacity of a type layer 
can convey an idea of gradual visibility 
of words onto an image. When working 
with opacity in multiple layers of type, 
you can create a sort of non-animated 
fade-in, each with a greater opacity. 
Figure 3-12 shows an example of this 
effect.
Another way to alter the transparency 
of type is to use a layer mask. (Check 
out Book VI, Chapter 3 for more infor-
mation on layer masks.) By using a 
layer mask, you can customize your 
transparency with maximum flexibility 
and still edit the text to change the 
wording, font size, font, or anything 
else. Simply apply a gradient, or grab 
a brush and paint on the layer mask. I 
used the fun Drippy Water Color Brush 
and painted on my layer mask, as 
shown in Figure 3-13.
The first Putting-It-Together project in 
this chapter, “Ghosting Your Type,” 
shows you another way to use type 
opacity to create a ghostly effect.

the message across.

Masking, Shaping, and Warping Type
Creating fade effects
To create text that appears to fade out, just follow these steps:
 
1. Enter the words fading out slowly (or other text of your choice) 
into a new type layer.
 
 You can find out how to enter text in the section “Entering Text in Point 
Type Mode,” earlier in this chapter.
 
2. Choose Layer➪Layer Mask➪Reveal All.
 
 This step creates a mask that can show or hide some of the layer. With 
Reveal All selected, the layer defaults to showing everything on the 
layer without hiding any of it. For details on layer masks, see Book VI, 
Chapter 3.
 
3. Press D to make sure that Photoshop’s colors are the default black and 
white.
 
4. Select the Gradient tool from the Tools panel.
 
 Or press Shift+G until the Gradient tool is active. For more on working 
with gradients, see Book IV, Chapter 2.
 
5. Select the Linear Gradient fill from the Options bar.
 
6. In the Options bar, click the Gradient picker (down-pointing arrow) 
and select the Foreground to Background gradient.
 
 This is, by default, the first one in the panel, unless you’ve changed the 
defaults.
 
7. Click the layer mask’s icon in the Layers panel to make sure it’s active. 
You will see brackets around the layer mask thumbnail icon.
 
8. Click on the left side of the type layer and drag to the right side.
 
 Photoshop creates a gradient in the layer mask that’s black on the right 
and fades to white on the left, as shown in Figure 3-14. So, the mask is 
most transparent on the left side (where the mask is white) and least 
transparent on the right side (where the mask is black). It reveals more 
of the original type on the left and fades it out on the right, as you can 
see in the figure.

Ghosting Your Type
 
Need some ghostly, semitransparent type? You can twist, transmogrify, and transform 
your text by using Photoshop’s arsenal of features. Create your type from scratch in an 
empty document or add the type to an existing picture or background. (You can ﬁ nd my 
example image on this book’s Web site.) For the heck of it, these steps show you how to 
add ghostly writing to an existing image. Just follow these steps:
 
1. Open the background image you want 
to overlay with the ghost type.
 
 Any image, ectoplasmic or not, will do.
 
2. Select the color you want to use for 
your text from the Swatches panel.
 
 Black and orange are good Halloween 
colors, but you can use any contrasting 
color.
 
 You can also sample a color from your 
image by using the Eyedropper tool. 
Simply click your desired color, and it 
then becomes your new foreground 
color.

3. Select the Horizontal Type tool from the Tools panel and then click the area where 
you want to add the text.
 
 The vertical cursor that appears is the size that the text will be.
 
4. Select a font, style, and size from the drop-down lists on the Options bar.
 
5. Select an anti-aliasing method to help smooth the edges of your type.
 
 Anti-aliasing, which I cover in the section “Using the Options Bar,” in this chapter, 
softens a hard edge by adding partially transparent pixels.
 
6. Type your text.
 
 The text appears on top of the background.
 
7. Click the Commit button (the check mark icon) on the Options bar to insert the text 
you’ve typed into a layer of its own.
 
8. To change the opacity of the type, adjust the Opacity setting in the Layers panel.
 
 To make additional changes to the text, use a ﬁ lter. For example, if you want to 
make the text wavy, select the Wave ﬁ lter in the Filter➪Distort menu. Or you can 
use other ﬁ lters from the array discussed in Book VII. Just remember, when you 
use a ﬁ lter, a warning pops up, informing you that the type layer must be rasterized 
(converted from editable text to pixels) ﬁ rst. Click OK, and you’re on your way.
 
9. When you’re satisﬁ ed with the look, save your image for additional editing later or 
choose Layer➪Flatten Image to combine the text and background.

Creating type outlines
In addition to its Vertical and Horizontal Type tools (discussed in the sec-
tion “Exploring the Type Tools,” earlier in this chapter), Photoshop includes 
Vertical and Horizontal Type Mask tools. These tools function almost identi-
cally to their conventional counterparts, with one important exception: Type 
mask tools don’t create a new layer. Instead, they create a selection that 
hovers over the currently active layer, like the one shown in Figure 3-15.
Figure 3-15: Type mask tools create selection marquees from your letter shapes.
You can treat the selections created with the type mask tools just as you can 
any other selection. Try the following:
 
✓ Move type mask selections around your document when any of the 
selection tools are active.

346
Masking, Shaping, and Warping Type
 
✓ Store type selections as alpha channels by choosing Select➪
Save Selection. I introduce selections in Book III, Chapter 3. You can find 
out how to save selections and make alpha channels in Book VI, Chapter 1.
 
✓ Skew type selections (or change them in some other way) by using 
Select➪Transform Selections. You can find more information on trans-
forming selections in Book III, Chapter 3.
 
✓ Convert a selection into an editable path, as described in the section 
“Transforming type into vector shapes and paths,” later in this chapter. 
Book III, Chapter 2 also introduces the joy of working with paths.
 
✓ Use the selection to cut or copy portions of an image in text-shaped 
chunks, as shown in Figure 3-16. You can find out how this last sug-
gestion works by following the steps in the Putting-It-Together project 
“Carving Your Type in Stone,” at the end of this chapter, in which you 
can find out how to literally carve your words in stone.
Rasterizing your type layer
 
The Type tool creates editable type layers. You can change the wording, 
spacing, font, font size, and other factors as much as you want, as long as 
the type remains in a type layer.
Digital Vision
Figure 3-16: Use a type mask to create type from an image.
However, after you make all the changes you want, you may need to convert 
your type layer to pixels in the form of rasterized type. After they’re raster-
ized, you can apply filters, paint on the type, and apply gradients and pat-
terns. Rasterizing type layers allows you to merge the type with other pixels 
in your image and, eventually, flatten the image to create a finished docu-
ment suitable for use with other programs.

347
Book IV
Chapter 3
Creating and 
Editing Type
Masking, Shaping, and Warping Type
 
After you convert your type to pixels, you can no longer edit the type. Nor 
can you resize the text without risking jaggies. Rasterize your type only when 
you’re certain you won’t need to edit or resize it anymore. Make a copy of the 
type layer before you rasterize it and toggle off the visibility of the copy, and 
make sure you save an unflattened copy of the document with all layers intact. 
By making these copies, if you need to edit the type, you can use the layered 
file that has the unrasterized text. For more on layers, see Book V.
To rasterize your type, select the type layer that you want to convert to 
pixels. Then, choose Layer➪Rasterize➪Type. The type is shown in the 
Layers panel on a transparent background.
Transforming type into vector shapes and paths
By default, regular type created with the Type tool is vector-based type, not 
bitmapped, rasterized type. But you can also convert regular type (each 
character) to individual vector shapes. The individual characters then 
become shapes defined by vector masks. You can edit the shapes like any 
shapes created with the shape tools, by manipulating anchor points, and 
straight and curved segments. See Book IV, Chapter 1 for the lowdown on 
shapes. And you can also convert regular type to work paths, where each 
character becomes a path, editable by using the selection arrows and Pen 
tools, like any other path. Type is usually converted into a path in order to 
create a vector mask based on the type (an image is contained within the 
editable paths created by the letterforms). For more on paths, see Book III, 
Chapter 2. For more on vector masks, see Book VI, Chapter 3.
So, you can convert regular, type to shapes in the form of a vector mask or 
work path. You convert type to vector shapes and paths in order to edit it 
with the Pen tools. Here are the ways to do that:
 
✓ To convert type to an editable work path, choose Layer➪Type➪
Create Work Path.
 
✓ To convert type to shapes, choose Layer➪Type➪Convert to Shape.
Rasterizing type the other way
In addition to rasterizing a type layer in the 
usual way, you can also rasterize it by merging 
it with a non-type layer. For example, in your 
Layers panel, if your type layer is directly on top 
a text layer that has already been rasterized, 
you can merge the layers by pressing Ctrl+E 
(Ô+E on the Mac).
You may also come across the opportunity to ras-
terize a type layer because Photoshop reminds 
you to. Some commands, particularly filters, oper-
ate only on pixels. When you try to use them, you 
may see a warning dialog box. Often, the dialog 
box includes an option for immediately convert-
ing the type layer to rasterized form.

348
Masking, Shaping, and Warping Type
Here are the chief things to know about 
type converted into a shape or path:
 
✓ Like a type layer, you can resize it 
without producing jagged diagonal 
lines.
 
✓ You can edit the shape of the charac-
ters, but you can’t edit the text itself, 
as shown in Figure 3-17.
 
✓ You must rasterize the converted 
type before you can merge it with 
pixel-based layers or apply special 
effects with filters. You can apply 
layer styles to any kind of type, how-
ever. Be sure to check out Book V, 
Chapter 4 for all you need to know 
about layer styles.
 
✓ If you’ve converted your type into 
a shape, it becomes a vector mask 
exactly like other vector masks in Photoshop, and you can edit the 
shape of the characters by using the Pen tools. You can find detailed 
information on editing vector masks in Book VI, Chapter 3.
Wreaking havoc on your type
Photoshop’s great automated Warp feature can twist your type in predict-
able ways that are not only repeatable but, thanks to the controls in their 
dialog boxes, also customizable. The cool part is that even though type has 
been warped, it remains fully editable until you rasterize it. All you need to 
do to warp your text is click the Warp icon on the Options bar, which opens 
the multifaceted Warp Text dialog box (shown in Figure 3-18), and then 
choose your warp style and distortion options in that dialog box.
 
Web designers take note: You can’t warp text that has a faux bold style 
applied (found in the Character panel).
You can find a whole list of special effects in the Warp Text dialog box, 
such as Arc, Arch, Bulge, Flag, Wave, Fish, Fisheye, and Twist. Each of these 
effects provides a special look to your type, as shown in Figure 3-19.

allows you to alter the shape of the letters.

Figure 3-18: Choose from a number of warp styles.
Each effect has a dialog box of its own 
that allows you to set the parameters 
for the amount, direction, degree of 
distortion, amount of bend, and so 
forth. You can watch your type warp 
right on-screen and tailor the distor-
tion however you like. You can apply 
most asymmetrical warp effects to 
type in either horizontal or vertical 
directions. Fisheye, Inflate, and Twist 
are among those effects that can’t be 
rotated because they’re already ori-
ented in horizontal and vertical direc-
tions that you can control with sliders.

Carving Your Type in Stone
You can use a type tool to create selections shaped like text and then use images them-
selves as textures for the type. A type selection can cut out any part of a picture for use 
any way you want.

Follow these steps to carve letters into a stone texture image:
 
1. Open the stone texture image you want to use.
 
 I’m using a sandstone wall, but you can use other kinds of stone, wood, or any 
texture that interests you. Best of all, the embossed look that results is only one of 
many different looks you can achieve simply by making small changes in the layer 
style that you apply to the text.
 
2. Select the Horizontal Type Mask tool from the Tools panel and then click the area 
where you want to enter your text.
 
3. Select the font, font style, font size, and other text parameters from the drop-down 
lists on the Options bar.
 
4. Enter the text you want to use onto 
the texture you’ve chosen. Then, click 
the Commit button (the check mark 
icon) on the Options bar to set your 
text.
 
 The selection in the shape of the text 
appears where you typed the text.
 
5. Press Ctrl+C (Ô+C on the Mac) to 
copy the selected area of your chosen 
texture (the brick in the shape of the 
text, in my example), and then press 
Ctrl+V (Ô+V on the Mac) to paste a 
text-shaped section of that texture in 
a layer of its own.
 
 The text blends in with what’s in the background layer (in my example, the sand-
stone) and is invisible (for now).
 
6. Choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Bevel and Emboss to open the Layer Style dialog box.
 
 In the Layer Style dialog box, you can ﬁ nd dozens of different effects that you can 
create.
 
7. Experiment with the settings in the Layer Style dialog box to try out different looks 
and to achieve various effects:
 
✓ Select the kind of beveling or embossing you want from the Style and Technique 
drop-down lists in the Structure area.
 
 I selected Inner Bevel and Chisel Hard to produce a dramatic, hard-edged 
embossing effect.
 
✓ Move the Depth slider to the right to increase the depth of the bevel.

✓ Select the Contour check box in the layer styles column on the left side of the 
dialog box for an even more pronounced 3-D look.
 
✓ In the Shading area, you can adjust controls that allow you to change the ap-
parent angle of the illumination that produces the bevel’s shadow.

Working with 
Layers

L
ayers are like modern appliances. Sure, you 
could live without a microwave, a dish-
washer, and a vacuum cleaner, but cooking and 
cleaning would take a lot longer, and it wouldn’t 
be nearly as convenient. Layers give Photoshop 
users the ultimate in editing flexibility. This in 
turn saves production time, giving you more time 
to let your creative juices flow. 
In this book, I give you information about how to 
create and edit layers. You see how to take multi-
ple images and create single composite images. I 
also cover how to manage your layers by using 
layer sets and layer comps. And you find out how 
to enhance your layers by using adjustment lay-
ers, layer styles, blend modes, and various opac-
ity settings. Finally, you’ll want to check out the 
chapter on the Smart Objects. These intelligent 
objects allow you to transform elements indefi-
nitely without loss of quality.

Chapter 1: Creating Layers
In This Chapter
✓ Backgrounds versus layers
✓ Taking a look at the types of layers
✓ Working with the Layers panel
✓ Creating layers
✓ Compositing with multiple layers
✓ Transforming layers
✓ Automatically aligning and blending layers
P
eople are often surprised and even downright shocked when I tell them 
that pretty much everything they can do with layers they can also do 
without them. Not using layers would be more technically chal-
lenging and a heck of a lot more tedious, but you could still 
get the job done. The benefit to using layers is that you 
have tremendous flexibility. The changes you make 
to the pixels on the individual layers are permanent, 
but the interaction between the pixels on different 
layers is dynamic. You can make endless edits as 
long as those layers exist. Layers make working 
in Photoshop a lot more forgiving, allowing you 
to make changes quickly and productively.
But hey, it’s not just the technical and practical 
aspects that make layers so wonderful. Layers also 
allow you to express your creative side, composit-
ing several images into one with just a drag of the 
mouse. The only downside to layers is that each one 
makes your file size grow and therefore can start to slow 
your system performance. And you can save layers in only a 
few file formats. But the downsides are a small price to pay for some-
thing that makes your image-editing life so much easier.
Getting to Know the Layers Panel
In terms of a real-world analogy, think of layers as sheets of acetate, similar 
to those clear plastic sheets used with overhead projectors. You draw 

356
Getting to Know the Layers Panel
different elements on the various sheets. What you draw on one sheet 
doesn’t affect the other sheets. You can show just one sheet, or you can 
stack several on top of one another to create a combination image. You can 
reshuffle the order of the sheets, add new sheets, or delete old sheets. Any 
space on the sheet that doesn’t have a mark on it is clear, or transparent.
That’s how layers work in Photoshop. You can place elements on separate 
layers, yet show them together to create a combination image, or composite. 
You can also add, delete, or rearrange layers. And unlike sheets of acetate, 
you can adjust how opaque or transparent the element on the layer is, as 
well as change the way the colors between layers interact (blend modes).
Just like with every other important aspect of Photoshop, the program 
houses layers in a single location, called a panel. It’s time to formally meet 
the powerful panel that controls the operations of layers. To display the 
Layers panel, shown in Figure 1-1, choose Window➪Layers or, easier yet, 
press F7.

The order of the layers in the Layers panel represents the order in the 
image. The top layer in the panel is the top layer in your image, and so on.
For some tasks, you can work on only one layer at a time. For other tasks, 
you can work on multiple layers simultaneously.

✓ Select multiple non-contiguous layers. Ctrl-click (Ô-click on the Mac) 
your desired layers.
 
✓ Select all layers except the Background. Choose Select➪All Layers.
 
✓ Select layers of similar type. If you want to select all the type layers, for 
example, select a layer and then choose Select➪Similar Layers.
 
✓ Deselect all layers. Choose Select➪Deselect Layers or click in the area 
below the bottom layer or background.
 
✓ Select the actual element (the non-transparent pixels) on the layer. 
Ctrl-click (Ô-click on the Mac) the layer’s thumbnail in the panel. If 
you forget this handy shortcut, you can also select your layer in the 
Layers panel and then choose Select➪Load Selection. Make sure that 
the layer name that appears in the Channel pop-up menu is [layer name] 
Transparency and click OK.
 
 ✓ Create an adjustment or fill layer. Click the Create a New Fill or 
Adjustment Layer icon at the bottom of the panel. Note that you can also 
click an adjustment icon in the new Adjustments panel. See “Introducing 
Different Types of Layers,” later in this chapter, for more on these layers.
 
 ✓ Duplicate an existing layer. Drag the layer to the Create a New Layer 
icon at the bottom of the panel. See the following section for more on 
creating layers.
 
✓ Rename a layer. When you create a new layer, Photoshop provides 
default layer names (Layer 1, Layer 2, and so on). If you want to rename a 
layer, simply double-click the layer name (the name, not the thumbnail) 
in the Layers panel, enter the name directly in the Layers panel, and press 
Enter (Return on the Mac). Although it may seem tedious to give your 
layers meaningful names, it can help your productivity, especially when 
the number of layers in your file starts to increase. This renaming short-
cut works throughout Photoshop (the Channels panel, the Paths panel, 
and so on). You can also select the layer and select Layer Properties from 
the Layers panel options menu or choose Layer➪Layer Properties.
 
✓ Determine what layer holds the element you want to edit. Select the Move 
tool and Ctrl-click (Ô-click on the Mac) the element. Photoshop automati-
cally activates the appropriate layer. Or you can right-click (Control-click on 
the Mac) the element. A context menu appears, telling you what layer the 
element resides on and then enabling you to select that layer.

Looking at the Background and Layers
 
 You can use the keyboard shortcut Alt+] (right bracket) (Option+] on 
the Mac) to move up one layer; Alt+[ (left bracket) (Option+[ on the 
Mac) to activate the next layer down.
 
✓ Adjust the interaction between colors on layers and adjust the trans-
parency of layers. You can use the blend modes and the Opacity and 
Fill options at the top of the panel to mix the colors between layers and 
adjust the transparency of the layers. For details, see Book V, Chapter 3.
 
 ✓ Delete a layer. Drag it to the trash icon at the bottom of the Layers 
panel. You can also choose Layer➪Delete➪Layer or choose Delete Layer 
from the panel options menu.
 
✓ Change the size of the layer thumbnails. Choose Panel Options from the 
panel menu and select a thumbnail size. You can also choose whether to 
display just the boundary of the layer contents or the whole document in 
the thumbnail. And, finally, you can choose to have a layer mask on your 
fill layer by default and have your layer effects appear in expanded view. 
Fill layers are described in the section “Taking advantage of fill layers,” 
later in this chapter, and layer effects are covered in Chapter 3.
The remaining icons at the bottom of the Layers panel allow you to link 
layers, create layer styles, layer masks, and layers groups, all of which war-
rant sections of their own. See Book V, Chapter 4 for more on layer styles 
and Chapter 2 for more on layer groups. Check out Book VI, Chapter 3 for 
more on layer masks.
The preceding list represents just the tip of the iceberg. You can also view 
and hide layers, link, lock, color-code, rearrange, merge, flatten, and animate 
layers. Book V, Chapter 2 covers most topics in detail.
Looking at the Background and Layers
When you create a new image with white or background colored contents, 
scan an image into Photoshop, or open a file from a stock photography CD 
or your own digital camera, you basically have a file with just a background.
An image contains only one background, and you can’t do much to it besides 
paint on it and make basic adjustments. You can’t rearrange the background in 
the stack of layers — it’s always on the very bottom of the Layers panel. You 
can’t change the opacity or blend mode of a background, either. What you can 
do is convert a background to a layer, and then the world’s at your feet.
To convert a background into a layer, follow these steps:
 
1. Double-click Background in the Layers panel.
 
 Alternatively, you can choose Layer➪New➪Layer from Background. 
Note that the name Background is italicized in the Layers panel, as 
shown in Figure 1-2.

2. Name the layer or leave it at the default name of Layer 0.
 
 You can also color-code your layer in this dialog box or by select-
ing Layer Properties from the panel pop-up menu. Color-coding 
your layer just makes it stand out more noticeably in the Layers 
panel.
 
3. Click OK.
 
 Photoshop converts your background into a 
layer, as indicated in the Layers panel. Note 
that the layer name is no longer italicized, as 
shown in Figure 1-3.
 
 When you create a new image with transpar-
ent contents, the image doesn’t contain a 
background but instead is created with a 
single layer. You can also convert a layer into 
a background by selecting it and then choos-
ing Layer➪New➪Background from Layer. 
Note that this option is available only when 
no background exists.

background to convert it into 
a layer.

Introducing Different Types of Layers
Introducing Different Types of Layers
Although turning the background into a layer (discussed in the preceding 
section) is a popular activity, Photoshop refers to layers in the plural for a 
reason. Image editing would be no fun if you didn’t have a variety of different 
layers to mess around with.
Photoshop Standard offers five types of layers (Extended gives you two 
more — Video and 3D). Four of the five have very specific purposes in the life 
of your image. Some you may never use, and some you’ll use only occasionally. 
But the vanilla-flavored type, which you’ll use the most, is simply called a layer.
Using plain vanilla layers
The regular layer is the one that most closely matches the acetate analogy 
(discussed in the section “Getting to Know the Layers Panel,” earlier in this 
chapter). You put various elements on separate layers to create a compos-
ite image. You can create blank layers and add images to them, or you can 
create layers from images themselves. You can create as many layers as 
your computer’s RAM lets you. And sometimes layers are created automati-
cally by a specific action.
Because each layer in an image is a separate entity, you can edit, paint, 
transform, mask, or apply a filter on a layer without affecting the other 
layers. And after an element is on a layer, you no longer have to make a 
selection (get the selection outline) to select it — you simply drag the ele-
ment with the Move tool. The element freely floats in a sea of transparency. 
Because showing “clear” areas or transparency is impossible on a computer 
monitor, Photoshop uses a gray-and-white checkerboard, by default, to rep-
resent the transparent areas of a layer.
Because you’ll work with regular layers on a daily basis, I spend the majority 
of Book V discussing them.
Playing around with layer masks
A layer mask is like a second sheet of acetate 
that hovers over a layer. You can use layer 
masks with regular layers, adjustment layers, 
fill layers, and Smart Filters. For example, you 
may paint on a layer mask (typically with black, 
white, and various shades of gray) to selectively 
hide or display an adjustment (or an image on 
a regular layer). Any black areas on the mask 
hide the adjustment, any white areas show the 
adjustment, and anything in between (gray) 
partially shows the adjustment. The new Masks 
panel gives you even more flexibility because 
it includes options for controlling the density 
and feather of the mask. I cover layer masks in 
detail in Book VI, Chapter 3.

Introducing Different Types of Layers
Using adjustment layers
An adjustment layer is a special kind of layer used mostly for color correc-
tion. What’s great about adjustment layers is that you can apply that color 
correction without permanently affecting any of your layers. Adjustment 
layers apply the correction to all the layers below them, without affecting 
any of the layers above them.
Because the color correction actually resides on a layer, you can edit, delete, 
duplicate, merge, or rearrange the adjustment layer at any time. You have 
more flexibility in your image-editing chores and more freedom for experi-
mentation. In addition, none of this experimentation harms your image 
because it takes place above the image on an adjustment layer.
Photoshop has 15 kinds of adjustment layers, and you can use as many as 
your heart desires. The adjustments offered are the same adjustments you 
find on the Image➪Adjustments menu. For specifics on each adjustment and 
what it corrects, see Book VIII, Chapter 1. Here’s how to create an adjust-
ment layer:
 
1. Open an image of your choice.
 
 Because you’re applying an adjustment layer, you may want to use an 
image that’s in need of some color correction. In the case of adjustment 
layers, you don’t need to convert your background into a layer. I chose 
an image that was oversaturated.
 
2. Choose Layer➪New Adjustment Layer. From the submenu, choose 
your desired adjustment. In the New Layer dialog box, name the layer 
(if you want), leave the other options at their defaults, and click OK.
 
 For my example, I chose Hue/Saturation.
 
 You can also just click the Create a New Fill or Adjustment Layer icon 
(the black and white circle icon) at the bottom of the Layers panel and 
choose an adjustment from the pop-up menu that appears.
 
 The dialog box pertaining to your adjustment appears in the new 
Adjustments panel. The adjustment layer also appears in the Layers 
panel, shown in Figure 1-4. The adjustment layer icon and a thumbnail 
appear on the adjustment layer. The thumbnail represents a layer mask. 
For more on layer masks, check out the “Playing around with layer 
masks” sidebar, in this chapter.
 
3. Make the necessary corrections and click OK.
 
Photoshop CS4 gives adjustment layers a panel of their very own. Choose 
Window➪Adjustments to bring up this new panel, shown in Figure 1-4. Click 
an icon to apply one of the 15 adjustments. The dialog box pertaining to 
your adjustment appears within the panel. You can also now select a preset 

362
Introducing Different Types of Layers
for an adjustment. Presets appear in the list window of the Adjustments 
panel (click the right-pointing arrow next to the adjustment name) or, after 
you select the adjustment, in the pop-up menu directly to the right of the 
adjustment name in that particular adjustment’s dialog box. Here are a few 
tips to keep in mind when working with this new panel:
 
✓ Click the arrow at the bottom of the panel to switch between the adjust-
ment list and adjustment controls windows.
 
✓ Click the manila envelope icon to switch between compact and 
expanded views of the panel.
 
✓ Click the triple-double circle icon to have the new adjustment affect all 
the underlying layers. Click again (to return to the default setting) to 
have the new adjustment clip to, or just affect, only the layer directly 
under the adjustment layer.
In the adjustment controls window
 
✓ Click the double circle to toggle between having the adjustment layer 
affect all layers or just the layer directly below the adjustment.
 
✓ Click the eye icon to toggle visibility of the adjustment layer.
 
✓ Click the eye and curved arrow icon to view a previous state.
 
✓ Click the curved arrow to reset the default settings for the adjustment 
layer.
 
✓ Click the trash icon to delete the adjustment layer.
 
✓ Access the panel pop-up menu to make adjustments, reset an adjust-
ment, change the view of the panel, save and load presets, or close the 
panel.
In my example, the layer mask is all white, so my adjustment shows up full 
strength over my image. Note that you can also apply an adjustment layer to 
a selected portion of your image by painting on your layer mask. Like regular 
layers, you can also adjust the opacity, fill, and blend modes of an adjust-
ment layer. For more on these options, see Book V, Chapter 3.
 
If you want to view your image without the adjustment, click the eye icon 
in the left column of the Layers panel to hide the adjustment layer. You can 
find more about viewing layers in Book V, Chapter 2. If you want to delete 
the adjustment layer, simply drag it to the trash icon in the Layers panel, 
or choose Delete➪Layer from the Layer menu or the Layers panel options 
menu. You can also perform these commands via the new Adjustments 
panel.

Editing adjustment layers
After you create an adjustment layer, you can easily edit it. Simply click the 
adjustment layer icon in the Layers panel. In the adjustment’s dialog box, 
make any edits and then click OK. The only adjustment layer that you can’t 
edit is the Invert adjustment. It’s either totally on or totally off.
Isolating your adjustments
If you don’t use an adjustment layer when you make color corrections, the 
correction you apply affects only the active layer (the layer highlighted in 
the Layers panel). But you can also isolate your adjustment layer to a single 
layer or a portion of a single layer.

364
Introducing Different Types of Layers
Here are some tips for using and isolating adjustment layers:
 
✓ Correct part (but not all) of a layer. To enable the adjustment layer 
to correct only a portion of a layer, make a selection before you create 
the adjustment layer. The adjustment affects only the pixels within the 
selection outline.
 
 The adjustment affects the pixels within the selection outline on each 
layer that resides below the adjustment layer. In addition to making a 
selection, you can also create and select a closed path (see Book III, 
Chapter 2 for more on paths).
 
 Another way to correct part of a layer is to paint on the adjustment layer 
mask. Painting with black hides the adjustment, painting with various 
levels of gray partially hides the adjustment. For more on layer masks, 
see Book VI, Chapter 3.
 
✓ Clip to the layer. By default, when you now apply a new adjustment 
layer, that adjustment clips to the layer directly below the adjustment 
layer. This means that the adjustment layer will affect only that under-
lying layer. You can, however, click the triple-double circle icon in the 
bottom-right corner of the Adjustment Layers panel to have the adjust-
ment affect all underlying layers.
 
✓ Create a layer group. You can create a layer group (described in Book V, 
Chapter 2) and place the layers you want adjusted in that group. Then, 
make sure that the blend mode is set to any mode except Pass Through. 
For more on modes, see Book V, Chapter 3.
Taking advantage of fill layers
A fill layer lets you add a layer of solid color, a gradient, or a pattern. Like 
adjustment layers, fill layers also have layer masks, as indicated by the mask 
icon thumbnail in the Layers panel.
You can create as many fill layers as you want, just like you can with regular 
layers and adjustment layers. You can also edit, rearrange, duplicate, delete, 
and merge fill layers. And you can blend fill layers with other layers by using 
the opacity, fill, and blend mode options in the Layers panel.
 
Like an adjustment layer, to confine the effects of a fill layer to a portion of 
the image, make a selection, or create and select a closed path, before you 
create the fill layer (see Book III, Chapter 2 for more on paths). And edit-
ing or changing the contents of a fill layer is similar to editing or changing 
the contents of an adjustment layer (see the preceding section for details), 
except that fill layers don’t have their own panel. To edit a fill layer, double-
click the fill layer thumbnail in the Layers panel.

365
Book V
Chapter 1
Creating Layers
Introducing Different Types of Layers
Here’s how to create a fill layer:
 
1. Open an image of your choice.
 
 In this case, open an image that would look good with a border or text. 
For my example, I created the word fujiyama by using the Horizontal 
Type Mask tool (for details, see Book IV, Chapter 3). If you don’t have an 
active selection, the fill layer encompasses your entire canvas.
 
2. Choose Layer➪New➪Fill Layer. From the submenu, choose your 
desired fill. Name the layer, leave the other options at their defaults, 
and click OK.
 
 For my example, I chose Pattern from the submenu.
 
 
 You can also just click the Create a New Fill or Adjustment Layer icon at 
the bottom of the Layers panel and select a fill from the pop-up menu.
 
3. Follow the steps that correspond with the option you choose in Step 2:
 
• Solid Color: Select your desired color from the Photoshop Color 
Picker. (For more on color, see Book II, Chapter 3.)
 
• Gradient: Select a preset gradient from the pop-up panel or click 
the gradient preview to display the Gradient Editor, where you can 
create your own gradient. Set additional gradient options, as desired. 
(For gradient details, see Book IV, Chapter 2.)
 
• Pattern: Select a pattern from 
the pop-up panel. Drag the 
scale slider to adjust the size of 
the pattern. I scaled my Crayon 
on Vellum pattern 120%, as 
shown in Figure 1-5. Click Snap 
to Origin to position the origin 
of the pattern with the docu-
ment window. Finally, select 
the Link with Layer option to 
specify that the pattern moves with the fill layer if you move it.
 
4. Click OK.
 
 After you close the dialog box, the fill layer appears in the Layers panel. 
Similar to adjustment layers, a layer mask was created on the fill layer. 
In my example, in Figure 1-6, the word fujiyama appears white on the 
layer mask, thereby allowing my pattern to show through. The remain-
ing areas are black, hiding my pattern. I added a couple of layer styles 
(Drop Shadow and Inner Bevel) to my type to jazz it up a bit. If you want 
to do the same, jump ahead to Book V, Chapter 4.
 
 If you want to delete the fill layer, do one of three things: Drag it to the 
trash icon in the Layers panel; choose Delete➪Layer from the Layer 
menu; or choose Delete Layer from the Layers panel options menu.
Figure 1-5: Scale your preset pattern for 
your fill layer.

366

One final note: You can rasterize a fill layer to convert it to a regular raster 
image. Choose Layer➪Rasterize➪Fill Content. A raster image enables you 
to use painting tools or filters on the layer. Raster images are introduced in 
Book II, Chapter 1.
Making use of shape layers
Believe or not, Photoshop isn’t just about photos and painting. It also has 
a whole slew of shape drawing tools — six, to be exact. You can fill those 
shapes with solid color, gradients, or patterns. When you create a shape, it 
resides on its own unique shape layer. A shape layer contains a vector mask, 
similar in concept to the adjustment layer mask described in the section 
“Using adjustment layers,” earlier in this chapter.
If you look at the Layers panel, you can see that the Shape layer has two 
thumbnails: One is entirely filled with color, and the other contains the 
path of the shape, as shown in Figure 1-7. To state it simply, the color is 
peeking through the path of the shape, and the rest of the layer is hidden or 
masked. The paths that constitute a shape are vector paths; when printed, 
they retain their smooth curves without the jagged edges you often see 
from bitmap editing programs. Although you can edit, move, and transform 
shapes, your ability to edit shape layers is limited. To apply filters and 
other special effects, you must first rasterize the shape layers — that is, 
convert the vector paths to pixels. For more details on shapes, see Book IV, 
Chapter 2.

Creating Layers

Figure 1-7: On a shape layer, color peeks through a path and is hidden everywhere else.
Using type layers
To create type, such as the type shown in Figure 1-8, 
click your canvas with the Type tool (horizontal 
or vertical) and type your desired text. After you 
commit your text by pressing Enter on the numeric 
keypad or clicking the Commit button on the 
Options bar (it looks like a check mark), you’ve 
created a type layer. In the Layers panel, you see a 
layer with a T icon, indicating that it’s a type layer. 
Initially, the name of the type layer corresponds to 
the text you typed (you can change the layer name, 
if you want). Like shapes, the text in Photoshop is 
true vector type and, if left in that format, always 
prints smooth and without the jaggies.
Another great thing about type in Photoshop is 
that it’s live; you can edit the text at any time. You 
can also change the orientation, apply anti-aliasing 
(softening of the edges), create paths from the type, and even warp it into 
various distortions. You can also convert the type to a shape. And like regular 
layers, you can move, rearrange, copy, and change the layer options (opacity, 
Figure 1-8: Type layers 
automatically appear when 
you create and commit type.

Making Layers
fill, and mode) of a type layer. If, however, you want to apply certain special 
effects, such as filters, you must first rasterize (convert into pixels) the text. 
For everything you need to know about type, see Book IV, Chapter 3.
Making Layers
As I mention in the section “Using plain vanilla layers,” earlier in the chapter, 
good, old-fashioned, regular layers are the backbone of the world of layers. 
The following sections take a look at the various ways to create these layers.
Creating a new layer
 
 
You can create a new layer in a couple of ways:
 
✓ To create a new blank layer in an image that’s currently open: Click the 
Create a New Layer icon at the bottom of the Layers panel. You can also 
create a new layer by selecting New Layer from the panel pop-up menu or 
by choosing Layer➪New➪Layer. Both methods open a dialog box in which 
you name your layer and specify other options for grouping, color-coding, 
blending, and opacity (all of which I explain in other chapters in Book V). 
Provide a name for your layer and click OK. If you chose the first method, a 
layer with the default name of Layer 1 appears in the Layers panel.
 
 When you click the Create a New Layer icon, the layer is added above 
your active layer. By holding down the Ctrl key (Ô on the Mac) when 
you click, Photoshop adds the new layer below the active layer.
 
✓ To create an entirely new document with a layer: Choose File➪New. 
In the New dialog box that appears, select the Transparent for the 
Background Contents option. Your new file then appears with Layer 1, 
rather than a background.
When your new transparent layer is ready and waiting, you can put content 
on the new layer in several ways:
 
✓ Use one of the painting tools and paint directly on the layer.
 
✓ Make a selection on another layer or the background (for the difference 
between the two, see the preceding sections in this chapter) within the 
same document or from another image entirely. Then, choose Edit➪Copy. 
Select your new blank layer in the Layers panel and choose Edit➪Paste.
 
✓ Make a selection on another layer (or the background) within the same 
document or from another image, and then choose Edit➪Cut. Select 
your new blank layer and choose Edit➪Paste. Just remember that 
Photoshop deletes the selection from the source and adds it to your 
new layer, as shown in Figure 1-9.
 
✓ Transfer an entire image to your new layer by choosing Select➪All and 
then either Edit➪Copy or Edit➪Cut. Select your new blank layer and 
choose Edit➪Paste.

hole on the original layer.
Using Layer via Copy and Layer via Cut
Another way to create a layer is to use the Layer via Copy command on 
the Layer menu. Make a selection on a layer or background and choose 
Layer➪New➪Layer via Copy. The copied selection is placed on a new layer 
with the default name of Layer 1. You can do the same with the Layer via Cut 
command, but in this case, Photoshop deletes the selected area from the 
source layer or background, and places it on the new layer. The source layer 
is left with a gaping transparent hole (refer to Figure 1-9). If you used the 
background for the source, your background color fills the space. Remember 
that you can use these two commands only within the same image. You can’t 
use them between multiple images.

370
Compositing with Multiple Images
Duplicating layers
If you want to duplicate an existing layer, first select it in the Layers panel. 
Then, drag the layer to the Create a new layer icon at the bottom of the 
panel. You can also duplicate a layer by selecting Duplicate Layer from the 
panel pop-up menu or by choosing Layer➪Duplicate Layer. Like with creat-
ing a new layer, both methods prompt you with a dialog box to name your 
layer and include other options. Provide a name for your layer and click OK. 
If you chose the first method, Photoshop provides the default name of the 
original layer with the word Copy appended to the name.
 
Duplicating layers can be especially handy when you want to experiment 
with a special effect but don’t want to harm your original image.
Compositing with Multiple Images
Often, when working with layers, you’re not confined to using a single image. 
I mean, you can do only so much to that family portrait taken down at the 
local photo studio. But take your family and put them in front of the ruins 
at Machu Picchu or the summit at Mount Everest (you can even add faux 
snow with a technique shown in Book VII), and you have endless hours of 
fun. When you get the hang of working with several images, you’ll find that 
it opens a whole new door of creative possibilities. And you’re not limited to 
just plain old snapshots. You can incorporate type, vector illustrations, and 
scans of just about anything you can place on a scanning bed. Apply some 
layer styles, maybe a filter or two (see Book VII), and you have an image 
worthy of some major wall space.
Bypassing the clipboard
Yes, you can always cut and paste, or copy 
and paste, a layer from one image to another, 
but I prefer to drag and drop, rather than copy 
and paste, between two images. By dragging 
and dropping, you bypass the temporary stor-
age area for copied and stored data, the clip-
board. (Whenever you copy or cut a selection, 
Photoshop stores the selection on the clip-
board until you’re ready to paste it to its new 
home.) So, what’s wrong with that? Well, noth-
ing, unless you’re working with high-resolution 
images. Storing images on the clipboard, even 
on a temporary basis, can slow down your 
system. Keeping your clipboard clear of data 
ensures that Photoshop is running lean and 
mean so that you can drag and drop more 
images, selections, and layers more quickly 
and more efficiently. If you want to hold a little 
spring cleaning on your clipboard, you can 
always choose Edit➪Purge➪Clipboard, which 
empties your clipboard of any stored data. Take 
my advice and try the drag-and-drop method. I 
guarantee that, like me, you’ll be flexing your 
trigger finger — all the better to drag and drop 
even faster.

Copying and pasting images
In the “Making Layers” section, earlier in this chapter, I explain how to use the 
Copy, Cut, and Paste commands within the same image or between two dif-
ferent images when you want to fill a new blank layer with content. You can 
also use the Copy and Paste commands without having a blank layer ready. 
When you copy and paste a selection without a blank layer, Photoshop auto-
matically creates a new layer from the pasted selection. You can go about 
your merry way and perform all your layer creations by using only those 
commands. However, I rarely use them when working with multiple images. I 
prefer the drag-and-drop method, which I describe in the following section.
 
The Copy Merged command on the Edit menu creates a merged copy of all 
the visible layers within the selection.
Dragging and dropping layers
To copy an entire layer from one document to another, simply select 
your desired layer in the Layers panel, grab the Move tool, and in your 
image window, drag and drop that layer onto your destination document. 
Photoshop automatically introduces the dropped layer as a new layer above 
the active layer in the image. You don’t need to have a selection outline to 
copy the entire layer. However, if you want to copy just a portion of the 
layer, make your desired selection, as shown in Figure 1-10, before you drag 
and drop with the Move tool. If you want the selected element to be cen-
tered on the destination image, hold down the Shift key while you drag and 
drop. See the sidebar “Bypassing the clipboard,” in this chapter, for more on 
dragging and dropping.
 
In order to drag and drop your images, be sure to specify that your 
images float rather than are tabbed. To do so, choose Window➪Arrange➪
Float All in Windows.
 
What if you have multiple elements on one layer and want to select only 
one of the elements to drag and drop? Simply grab the Lasso tool and draw 
around the object. You don’t have to be super precise, but don’t include 
any portion of the other elements on the layer. Then, hold down the Ctrl 
key (Ô key on the Mac) and press the up-arrow key once. The element then 
becomes neatly selected. Not only can you drag and drop the element, but 
you can also move or edit it without affecting the other pixels on the layer. 
Flip to Book III, Chapter 1 for help with making selections.
Using the Paste Into command
You may occasionally want to place an image on a separate layer, yet have it 
fill a selection. That’s where Edit➪Paste Into comes into play. This command 
enables you to insert a copied or cut selected image into a selection outline.

For example, if you want to make it appear as if a snake is poking its head 
out of the opening of a cave, or a bottle is poking out of a can, as shown in 
Figure 1-11, Paste Into is your command. Be sure to check out the Putting-
It-Together project, in this chapter, to get more practice at this practical 
technique.
Follow these steps to insert a copied or cut selected image into a selection 
outline:
 
1. Make the selection on the layer that you want the image to fill.
 
 I’ll call this the destination layer.
 
2. Select the image that will fill that selection.
 
 I’ll call this the source image.
 
3. Choose Edit➪Copy.
 
4. Return to the destination layer and choose Edit➪Paste Into.
 
 Photoshop converts the selection outline on the destination layer into a 
layer mask. The pasted selection is visible only inside the selection out-
line. In my example, my bottle is showing only inside my selection. The 
bottom of the bottle is hidden, making it look like my bottle is sitting 
inside the can.

Transforming Layers
When compositing multiple images, you’ll no doubt have to scale some of 
your image to fit it into your layout. Fortunately, Photoshop makes scaling 
an easy chore by providing you with the Transform and Free Transform 
commands on the Edit menu. Transforming layers is almost identical to 
transforming selections, except that you don’t need to make a selection 
first. After an element is on a layer, you can just choose the appropriate 
transformation command and off you go. In addition, you can apply a trans-
formation to multiple layers simultaneously if you select the multiple layers 
first. Because I explain each transformation in excruciating detail in Book III, 
Chapter 3, check that out if you need more detail.

374
Auto-Align Layers
 
Try to perform all your transformations in one execution. Don’t go back 
numerous times and apply various transformations. Each time you trans-
form pixels, you’re putting your image through the interpolation process 
(increasing, decreasing, or remapping pixels). Done repeatedly, your image 
may start to turn into mush. And if not mush, it won’t be as pristine and 
crisp as it was before.
If your image looks jagged after you transform it, you may have your prefer-
ences set incorrectly for your interpolation method. Choose Edit➪Preferences➪
General (Photoshop➪Preferences➪General on the Mac) and select the Bicubic 
option from the Image Interpolation pop-up menu. Bicubic enables a smoother 
appearance to your interpolated pixels. You can also try Bicubic Smoother 
when resampling up (upsampling) and Bicubic Sharper when resampling 
down (downsampling). For more on resolution and resampling, see Book II, 
Chapter 1.
 
When the Move tool is active, you can transform a layer without choosing a 
command. Simply select the Show Transform Controls option on the Options 
bar. This option surrounds the contents (or an active selection) of the layer 
with a bounding box that has handles. Drag these handles to transform the 
contents.
Auto-Align Layers
One of the coolest features in Photoshop is the Auto-Align Layers command. 
How many times have you taken photos at a reunion, wedding, or other 
family event where none of the shots are perfect? In one shot, Aunt Marlene 
has her eyes closed. In another, Momma Sue is looking to the side for Junior 
who should be in the photo. The Auto-Align Layers feature enables you take 
these multiple images and composite them into that perfect shot by aligning 
your image and then letting you mask out the parts of the image that you 
don’t want.
 
Note that you can also use the Auto-Align Layers feature to stitch together 
images such as panoramic shots or scans of oversized images — any series 
of images that have even a slight overlap.
Follow these steps to Auto-Align your layers:
 
1. Create a new document with the same dimensions as your source images.
 
2. Open all your source images. With the Move tool, drag and drop each 
image into the new document.
 
 Each image should be on a separate layer.
 
3. If you desire, you can choose a layer to use as a reference. Lock the 
reference layer.

375
Book V
Chapter 1
Creating Layers
Auto-Align Layers
 
 If you don’t set a reference layer, Photoshop analyzes the layers and then 
selects the layer in the center of the final composite as the reference.
 
4. In the Layers panel, select all the layers you want to align and choose 
Edit➪Auto-Align Layers.
 
5. Choose one of the projection methods:
 
• Auto: Photoshop analyzes the layers, decides which method would 
create the best composite, and then applies the alignment.
 
• Perspective: Photoshop designates one of the layers as the reference 
layer. The remaining layers are then transformed so that content is 
aligned.
 
• Collage: This option enables you to move, rotate, and scale your 
layers to get your desired layout.
 
• Cylindrical: This is a good option for panoramic shots. It places the 
reference layer in the center and then places remaining layers on an 
unfolded cylinder to minimize distortion.
 
• Spherical: This option also places the reference layer in the center 
and places the remaining layers on a sphere to correct distortion. 
This option comes in handy when you want to align shots taken with 
a wide-angle lens.
 
• Reposition Only: This is a good option when you need to stitch 
together oversized scanned images. It’s also the option you want to 
select if you’re trying to create the perfect shot that I described in 
the introduction of this section.
 
6. Check options to correct for lens problems such as Vignette Removal 
and Geometric Distortion.
 
 Vignetting is an exposure problem caused when light at the edges of the 
images is reduced and the edges become darkened. Geometric Distortion 
refers to problems such as barrel (bulging out) and pincushion (pinch-
ing in) distortions.
 
7. Click OK.
 
 Photoshop then finds the common areas of the layers and aligns them, 
as shown in Figure 1-12. If you’re stitching together images, you’re done. 
If the composite has visible seams or inconsistencies, you can apply the 
Auto-Blend Layers command described in the following section.
If you’re creating the perfect shot, add a layer mask to your top layer, set 
your foreground color to black, and use the Brush tool (with the appropri-
ate size tip) to paint over the portions you want to hide or delete. In a mask, 
black hides pixels, so the layer underneath shows through. Repeat this 
process of layer masking your content until you have the shot you want. For 
more on layer masks, see Book VI.

376
Auto-Blend Layers
Figure 1-12: Use Auto-Align Layers to stitch or composite multiple images.
Auto-Blend Layers
You may have images that need to be stitched together. For example, you 
may need to stitch together a series of panoramic shots you took or an 
oversize image you had to scan in several sections because it couldn’t fit on 
your scanner. As you can see in Figure 1-13, the Auto-Blend command helps 
to smooth out the tell-tale seams or weird color inconsistencies that occur 
when stitching together shots with different exposures or contrast settings. 
Note that you can also use the File➪Automate➪Photomerge command to 
stitch together images. For more on Photomerge, see Book IX, Chapter 2.

Book V
Chapter 1
Creating Layers
Auto-Blend Layers
You can also use this command to blend a stack of several images together. 
For example, say you took several shots, at varying depths of field, of a 
group of flowers, which caused some flowers to be in focus and others to 
be blurry. You can blend them together to get a composite shot with all the 
flowers in focus.
Follow these few steps to blend layers:
 
1. Create a new document and then open all your source images. With 
the Move tool, drag and drop each image into the new document.
 
 Each image should be on a separate layer.
 
2. Select all the layers and choose Edit➪Auto-Align Layers.
 
 Note that you can try and align the layers yourself manually.
Figure 1-13: Seamlessly blend your images with the Auto-Blend command.

378
Auto-Blend Layers
 
3. Choose a projection method (see details in the preceding section), 
then click OK.
 
4. Select all the layers (avoiding the Background layer, if you have one) 
and choose Edit➪Auto-Blend Layers.
 
5. Select your Blend Method — either Panorama or Stack Images.
 
 Select Panorama for, well, panoramic shots. Select Stack Images for non-
panoramic images, such as shots of flowers with varying depths of field. 
Check the Seamless Tones and Colors option to optimize the blending of 
the multiple images.
 
6.  Click OK.
 
 Notice that this command automatically applies layer masks to each 
layer, as necessary. These layer masks attempt to mask, or hide, under- 
and overexposed areas.
 
You can apply this command only on RGB or Grayscale images.
Putting It Together
Creating Layers and Using the Paste Into Command 
to Make a Collage
If you remember your elementary-school days, you probably remember cutting out a 
bunch of pictures from magazines and pasting them on a piece of construction paper. 
Well, with Photoshop, the idea of a collage isn’t much different, but the activity is a 
little more reﬁ ned. Maybe you want to let loose your artistic side. Or maybe you need 
to combine several images into one as part of a job. Whatever your reason, you can 
use the steps here to get started on your ﬁ rst collage. And by the way, if collage is too 
froufrou a word for you, you can substitute it with composite — which has the deﬁ ni-
tion of “derived from many components.” I usually do.
 
Creating a collage takes many steps. Throughout Book V, you can ﬁ nd several ongoing 
Putting-It-Together projects, all of which lead you to a ﬁ nished collage. Be sure to save 
your collage ﬁ le so that you can work on it while you make your way through this 
minibook.
If you’re short on photos, you can go to www.gettyimages.com. Be sure to 
register so that you can have access to a huge gallery of free comping images. Comp-
ing images are small, low-resolution images used for internal corporate or personal 
noncommercial use only. You can also purchase high-resolution images for a song ($1 
to $5) at www.istockphoto.com or www.stockxpert.com.
To create the ﬁ rst layer of your collage, follow these steps:

379
Book V
Chapter 1
Creating Layers
Auto-Blend Layers
 
1. Decide on two images you want to use in your collage and open them by choos-
ing File➪Open.
 
 I recommend picking an image to use as your main canvas and then opening up a 
supporting image that you can select and then drag onto that main image. How-
ever, if you want, you can also start with just a blank document. For my example, I 
decided on a travel theme and opened an image of the Grand Canyon and another 
image of a passport, as shown in the ﬁ gure.
Photo Disc
 
2. Choose Window➪Layers to open the Layers panel.
 
 Always be sure that the Layers panel is visible whenever you’re creating a com-
posite from multiple images. You need to see what’s happening while you drag 
and drop, and you need to be aware of what layer you’re working on at all times.
 
3. Select the desired element in the supporting image.
 
 Feel free to use whatever selection method suits your fancy, but remember, the 
ﬁ nished collage will look only as good as its individual selections. For more on making 
selections, see Book III.
 
 Because the contrast between my passport and the background behind it was 
very good, I grabbed the Magic Wand tool, set the Tolerance to 50, and clicked 
the passport. I then held down the Shift key and, with the Lasso tool, circled the 
remaining pixels in the gold type that the Magic Wand tool didn’t pick up.
 
4. Choose Select➪Modify➪Contract and, in the Contract Selection dialog box, 
enter a value. Then, choose Select➪Modify➪Feather and enter a value in the 
Feather Selection dialog box.
continued

380
Auto-Blend Layers
continued
 
 Contract the selections lightly (I chose a value of 1 pixel) before you apply a 
feather (I chose a 0.5 pixel value) to avoid picking up some of the background dur-
ing the feathering process. Note that the values you choose depend on the reso-
lution of your images — the lower the resolution, the smaller the value needed.
 
 Using a small feather helps to avoid the harsh, I-cut-it-out-with-a-pair-of-pinking-
shears look.
 
5. With the Move tool, drag and drop the selection onto the background image.
 
 The Layers panel shows that you’ve produced a layer. You’ll notice that your main 
image remains as the background below the layer, as shown in the ﬁ gure.
 
 Don’t worry if your element isn’t the right size. You can ﬁ nd a Putting It Together 
project in Book V, Chapter 2 that shows you how to scale the layer.
 
6. Choose File➪Save As. In the Save As dialog box, name the ﬁ le collage and 
make sure the format is Photoshop.
 
 Keep the ﬁ le in a handy spot on your hard drive so that you can ﬁ nd it when 
you’re ready to do more with your collage.
In the preceding steps, I showed you how to create a layer by dragging and dropping a 
passport onto a background image of the Grand Canyon. The process I demonstrate in 
the following steps is a little different. It entails pasting one selection into another.
Sticking with my travel theme, I opted to take the image of a compass and paste it into 
the background so that the compass looks like it’s peaking out from the side of the 
canyon. To paste one selection into another on your collage, follow these steps:

381
Book V
Chapter 1
Creating Layers
Auto-Blend Layers
continued
 
1. Choose File➪Open. Select the ﬁ le you saved from the preceding exercise. Also, 
open a new supporting image.
 
2. Choose Window➪Layers to open the Layers panel.
 
 Always keep the Layers panel visible whenever you’re creating a composite from 
multiple images.
 
3. Select the part of the supporting image that you 
want to use.
 
 Feel free to use whatever selection method you 
desire, but try to get as accurate a selection as 
you can.
 
 For my compass image, I used the Elliptical 
Marquee tool, while holding down the Alt key 
(Option on the Mac), to draw from the center out 
to select the bottom portion of the compass. With 
the same tool, I held down the Shift key, then the 
mouse button, and then the Alt key (Option) to add the top portion of the compass, 
as shown in the ﬁ gure.
 
4. Contract and feather the selection (as described in Step 4 in the preceding set of 
steps).
 
 Unless you’re going for some special effect, be consistent with the treatment of 
the edges of each of your elements in your composite.
 
5. Choose Edit➪Copy.
 
6. In your saved collage ﬁ le, move the ﬁ rst supporting image (the image you added 
in the preceding set of steps) to the side with the Move tool. Then, use the Lasso 
tool (or any other selection tool) to create a selection in which to paste your 
new supporting image.
 
 I want the compass image to look like it’s peeking up from behind the side of the 
canyon, so I made a selection in the cliffs of the Grand Canyon.
 
7. Choose Edit➪Paste Into.
 
 If you use the Move tool to move the pasted image around the canvas, you see 
that the pasted image is invisible outside the boundaries of the selection outline, 
as shown in my collage.
 
 Don’t be concerned if your element isn’t the right size. I show you how to scale 
your layer in Book V, Chapter 2.

382
Auto-Blend Layers
continued
 
 The Layers panel shows a second thumbnail next to the compass thumbnail. This 
thumbnail represents the layer mask created automatically when you pasted into 
a selection. A layer mask allows portions of the layer to show and be hidden. In my 
example, the white areas on the layer mask are where my compass shows through. 
Those white areas correspond to the selection I made in Step 6. The black areas 
represent where my compass would be hidden if I were to move it into those areas. 
For more on layer masks, see Book VI, Chapter 3.

Chapter 2: Managing Layers
In This Chapter
✓ Viewing, moving, and shuffling layers
✓ Aligning and distributing layers
✓ Linking and locking layers
✓ Creating layer sets
✓ Flattening and merging layers
✓ Using the Layer Comps panel
H
opefully, you had the time and inclination to check out the first chapter 
of Book V. That’s where you get all the basic information on creating 
layers. In this chapter, you get the scoop on how to manage the layers you’ve 
created. And unlike some coworkers, clients, or family members, 
layers are downright agreeable to being managed — even 
micromanaged, for that matter. The beauty of layers is 
that they’re so darn easy to get along with. You can hide 
them, shuffle them around, link and lock them, herd 
them into groups, and even smush them together 
into one loving, collective layer. Yes, Photoshop 
has a whole slew of ways to get your layers in the 
orderly and organized fashion you deserve.
Often, hiding all the layers in your image except 
for the one you want to edit is useful. You can 
focus on the element at hand without the distrac-
tion of all the other components of the image. 
You can hide a layer with a single quick click of the 
mouse button, as I describe in the following list:
 
✓ Hide all the layers but one. Select the layer you want 
to display. Alt-click (Option-click on the Mac) the eye icon 
for that layer in the left column of the Layers panel. To redisplay all the 
layers, Alt-click (Option-click on the Mac) the eye icon again.
 
✓ Hide an individual layer. Click the eye icon for that layer, as shown 
in Figure 2-1. To redisplay the layer, click the blank space in the eye 
column.

384
Managing Layers
Photo Disc
Figure 2-1: You can hide and show individual layers to better focus your tasks.
You can also hide layer styles or entire layer groups by using the same 
method as with layers. You can find out more about layer groups in the sec-
tion “Creating Layer Groups,” later in this chapter. For the lowdown on layer 
styles, see Book V, Chapter 4.
 
Only layers that are visible will print. Hiding layers for printing can be useful 
if you want to have several versions (each on a separate layer) of an image 
for a project within the same document. You can view selective layers, print 
them, get approval from the powers that be, and then delete the layers with 
the scrapped versions. Only one file to manage — even I can handle that.
 
If clicking is just too strenuous for you, try this neat trick: Drag through the 
eye column to hide or display multiple layers in one fell swoop. Now that’s 
technology.

385
Book V
Chapter 2
Managing Layers
Moving Layer Elements
Rearranging Layers
You can shuffle the order of layers like clear sheets of acetate used with 
overhead projectors. The stacking order of the layers in the Layers panel 
corresponds to the order of the layers in the document. If you want to move 
a layer to another position in the stacking order, drag the layer (or layer 
group) up or down in the Layers panel. While you drag, you see a fist icon. 
Release your mouse button when a highlighted line appears where you want 
to insert the layer.
Alternatively, you can change the order by selecting the layer (or layer 
group) and then choosing Layer➪Arrange. Then, select one of the following 
commands from the submenu:
 
✓ Bring to Front and Send to Back: Send the layer to the very top or very 
bottom of the stacking order.
 
✓ Bring Forward and Send Backward: Move the layer one level up or down.
 
✓ Reverse: Switches the order of your layer stack if you have two or more 
layers selected.
 
If your image has a background, it always remains the bottommost layer. If 
you need to move the background, first convert it to a layer by double-clicking 
the name in the Layers panel. Enter a name for the layer and click OK.
Moving Layer Elements
Rearranging layers is different from moving the content on the layer. Because 
the elements on a layer are free floating on a bed of transparency, it’s a piece 
of cake to move the element whenever necessary. Moving the element has no 
effect on any of the other layers, and it doesn’t harm the image one iota.
To move an image on a layer, first select that layer in the Layers panel and 
then just drag it with the Move tool (the arrow pointer with a tiny four-headed 
arrow), located in the Tools panel; it doesn’t get any simpler than that. Here 
are a few more handy tips when moving an image and using the Move tool:
 
✓ Move the layer in 1-pixel increments. Press an arrow key (located 
between the keyboard and keypad) when you have the Move tool 
selected. To move the layer in 10-pixel increments, press Shift when you 
press the arrow key.
 
✓ Find out what layer holds the element you want to move (or edit 
in some other way). If you have the Auto-Select and Layer options 
selected in the Options bar, select the Move tool and click the element. 

386
Moving Layer Elements
Photoshop automatically activates the layer that the element resides 
on. If you don’t have this option checked, then Ctrl-click (Ô-click on the 
Mac) the element. Or, you can right-click (Control-click on the Mac) the 
element. A context menu appears, telling you what layer the element 
resides on, and then enables you to select that layer from the context 
menu. Note that it also lists the background layer.
 
✓ Switch to a layer when you click with the Move tool on any part of a 
layer. Select the Auto-Select and Layer options on the Options bar. But 
be careful if you use this option, especially if you have a lot of overlap-
ping elements; you may inadvertently select a layer when you don’t 
want to.
 
✓ Select the Auto-Select and Group options on the Options bar to select 
the layer group that the selected layer is in. For more on groups, see 
the section “Creating Layer Groups,” later in this chapter.
 
✓ Display a bounding box that has handles around the elements on your 
layer. Select the Show Transform Controls check box on the Options 
bar. This box can be useful if all your elements are melting into one 
another in an indistinguishable conglomeration.
 
 I recommend keeping this option checked so that you essentially have 
the same controls (scale, rotate, and so on) you have if you chose Edit➪
Free Transform. For more on transformations, see Book III, Chapter 3.
Putting It Together
Transforming and Moving Layers in a Collage
When you have a couple of images in your collage (see the Putting It Together project 
in Book V, Chapter 1), you can start transforming them to your liking. Moving and scaling 
are the manipulations you’ll probably do the most. Photoshop enables you to transform 
layers without affecting any other layer within the image. (For more on transformations, 
see Book V, Chapter 1 and Book III, Chapter 3.) To transform and move images in a col-
lage, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪Open. Select your saved collage ﬁ le in the dialog box that opens.
 
2. Choose Window➪Layers to open the Layers panel.
 
3. In the Layers panel, select the layer you want to transform.
 
 In my example, I chose the layer that has the passport on it.
 
4. Choose Edit➪Free Transform.
 
 By choosing Free Transform rather than Transform, you interpolate the image only 
once, rather than twice. For more on interpolation, see Book II, Chapter 1.

5. Shift-drag a corner transformation handle to scale the image down to the desired 
size but maintain the proportions, which reduces the amount of distortion.
 
 I reduced the passport in my example to about half its original size.
 
6. Position the cursor just outside the handle until a curved arrow appears. Rotate 
the image the desired amount.
 
 The ﬁ gure shows my example; I rotated the passport about 35 degrees.
Photo Disc
 
7. When you transform the selection to your liking, double-click inside the trans-
form box or press Enter (Return on the Mac).
 
8. Transform the element that has a layer mask. In the Layers panel, choose the 
layer and follow Steps 4 through 7.
 
 In my example, that’s the compass layer.
 
 Be sure to click the layer’s thumbnail and not the layer mask thumbnail. Other-
wise, you transform the layer mask thumbnail, rather than the element.
 
9. When you transform the selection to your liking, double-click in the transform box.
 
 I scaled the compass slightly so that the top of the compass became visible. Then, I 
rotated the compass to show more of the compass face, rather than the cover.
 
10. Choose File➪Save.
You probably already have a pretty good sense of the possibilities (which are inﬁ nite) 
available to you when you create and change collages. Of course, you can always add 
more stuff to a collage and rearrange the layers, as needed. Just follow these steps:

388
Moving Layer Elements
continued
 
1. Choose File➪Open and select your collage ﬁ le. Also open another image.
 
 I chose a boarding pass image.
 
2. Choose Window➪Layers to open the Layers panel if it isn’t already visible.
 
3. Select the desired element in the supporting image.
 
 It goes without saying that making the selection accurate can only enhance your 
composite. I selected the boarding pass with the Polygonal Lasso tool.
 
4. Contract and feather the image’s edges and use the Move tool to drag the selection 
into the collage ﬁ le.
 
 For the most professional appearance possible, use consistent values for modifying 
and feathering all the selections in this composite.
 
5. Position and transform the selection, as needed.
 
 Follow the directions provided in the preceding steps list. In my example, I scaled 
the boarding pass to the same size as the passport, rotated it clockwise, and posi-
tioned it a little lower than the passport.
 
6. In the Layers panel, rearrange your layers, if needed, by selecting a layer and drag-
ging it above another layer.
 
 In my image, I dragged my passport layer above my boarding pass layer, as shown 
in the following ﬁ gure.
 
 Because the layers are independent entities, you can shufﬂ e them indeﬁ nitely like a 
deck of cards.

Aligning and Distributing Layers
Aligning and Distributing Layers
If you’re a precision junkie like me, you’ll appreciate Photoshop’s ability to 
align and distribute your layers. These commands can be especially useful 
when you need to align items such as navigation buttons on a Web page 
mock-up or a row of headshots for a corporate publication.
Follow these steps to align and distribute your layers:
 
1. In the Layers panel, select the layers you want to align, as shown in 
Figure 2-2.
Figure 2-2: Select the layers you want to align in the Layers panel.
 
2. Choose Layer➪Align and select 
one of the alignment commands.
 
 Photoshop provides you with 
handy little icons that illustrate the 
various alignment types. You also 
find these icons as buttons on the Options bar when you have the Move 
tool selected, as shown in Figure 2-3. Feel free to use either method.
Figure 2-3: The Options bar offers different 
alignment buttons.

390
Linking Layers
 
 Note that, depending on which alignment 
type you choose, Photoshop aligns to the 
layer element that’s the farthest to the top, 
bottom, left, or right. If you align to the center, 
Photoshop splits the difference among the 
various layer elements.
 
3. In the Layers panel, select three or more 
layers that you want to distribute evenly.
 
4. Choose Layer➪Distribute and select one of 
the distribute commands.
 
 The distribute commands evenly space the 
layers between the first and last elements in 
either the row or column.
 
 For the word-challenged, you can find an icon 
illustrating the distribution types. And like 
alignment, the distribute icons appear as but-
tons on the Options bar when you have the 
Move tool selected. You can see the buttons 
from Figure 2-2 precisely aligned and evenly 
distributed in Figure 2-4.
You can also align a layer to a selection outline by following these steps:
 
1. Make your desired selection in the image.
 
2. Select a layer or layers in the Layers panel.
 
3. Choose Layer➪Align Layers to Selection and choose an alignment 
type from the submenu.
 
 Note that the Align Layers to Selection command doesn’t appear in the 
Layer menu until you have both layers and an active selection outline.
 
 For the Auto-Align Layers option, the last icon on the Options bar, check 
out Book V, Chapter 1.
Linking Layers
You’ll probably find that you don’t need to link layers in most cases. Simply 
select multiple layers and apply your command — moving, scaling, rotating, 
and so on. Occasionally, however, you may want to link layers so that they 
stay grouped as a unit until you decide otherwise.
Figure 2-4: The aligned and 
evenly distributed buttons.

Linking Layers
To link layers, follow these short steps:
 
1. Select the layers or layer groups in the 
Layers panel.
 
2. Click the Link Layers icon at the bottom of 
the Layers panel, as shown in Figure 2-5.
 
 A link icon appears to the right of the layer 
name in the Layers panel.
 
 To remove a link, click the Link Layers icon 
again.
 
If you find the need to quickly select all the 
linked layers in your Layers panel, select just 
one of the layers and then choose Select Linked 
Layers from either the Layer menu or the Layers 
panel pop-up menu. This technique can come 
in handy, for example, when working on Web 
pages with a lot of linked layers containing but-
tons or labels in a navigation bar.

Putting It Together
Selecting Layers in a Collage and Adjusting Their Size
When you’re working on composites, you may ﬁ nd the need to adjust the size or angle of 
more than one layer. You can select the layers you want to scale or rotate and transform 
all the layers at the same time. This strategy enables you to adjust all the layers the same 
amount at the same time — thus ensuring that they stay proportional in size. If you want 
to be certain that all the layers stay selected during the transformation process, you can 
link them for extra insurance. Follow these steps:
 
1. Open your saved collage ﬁ le.
 
 Make sure that the Layers panel is visible.
 
2. Select the layers you want to transform. If you want to link them, simply click the 
Link Layers icon at the bottom of the Layers panel.
 
 In my example, I selected Layers 1 and 3 — my passport and boarding pass.

Locking Layers
Locking Layers
After you get your layers the way you want 
them, you may want to lock them to pre-
vent them from being changed, as shown 
in Figure 2-6. To lock a layer, select it in the 
Layers panel and select one or more of the 
lock options at the top of the Layers panel. 
See Table 2-1 for details about each option.
 
You can also choose Layer➪Lock Layers or 
select Lock Layers from the Layers panel 
pop-up menu.
continued
 
3. Choose Edit➪Free Transform and Shift-drag the corner transformation handle to 
scale the layers. When you’re satisﬁ ed, double-click inside the transform box or 
press Enter (Return on the Mac).
 
 Because both layers are selected, any transformation you apply, including moving 
and scaling, affects both layers, as shown in the ﬁ gure.

Locking Layers
When you select the Lock All option, a solid, dark gray lock icon appears 
on the layer, indicating the layer is fully locked. When you select any of the 
other lock options, the lock appears light gray and hollow, indicating the 
layer is partially locked.
By default, the background is locked and can’t be unlocked until you con-
vert the background into a layer by choosing Layer➪New➪Layer from 
Background. In addition, by default, type layers have the Lock Transparent 
Pixels and Lock Image Pixels options selected. These options are grayed out 
and can’t be deselected. However, if you need to paint on the type layer, you 
can always rasterize it, thereby removing all locking options. For more on 
type, see Book IV, Chapter 3.
 
If you have layer groups, you can choose Layer➪Lock All Layers in Group or 
select Lock All Layers in Group from the Layers panel pop-up menu.

Color-Coding Layers
Color-Coding Layers
To visually distinguish your 
layers in the Layers panel, 
Photoshop lets you color-code 
your layers or layer groups, as 
shown in Figure 2-7. Choose 
Layer➪Layer Properties or select 
Group Properties from the Layers 
panel pop-up menu. Choose a 
color from the drop-down list and 
click OK.
 
For a great timesaver, right-click 
(Control-click on the Mac) the 
layer’s eyeball icon to make a 
context menu listing the colors 
appear.
 
I find that color-coding works 
especially well with layer groups. 
First, organize your layers into 
groups, such as navigation but-
tons, type, images, border, back-
ground, and so on. Then, assign a 
color to each group. By using the 
same color-coding system from 
one project to the next, you can get a little productivity boost by 
instinctively knowing where to find your elements.
Creating Layer Groups
I don’t know about you, but having a file cabinet full of neatly labeled manila 
folders containing all my vital paperwork is very satisfying. It’s compact. It’s 
organized. It’s “at the ready,” as they say in the military. Fellow geeks can 
revel in Photoshop’s digital answer to the manila folder, which enables you 
to organize layers into layer groups. You can expand or collapse layer groups 
to see or hide their contents. In their collapsed state, layer groups are a 
great antidote for the annoying scrolling that you must do in an abundantly 
layered file. And groups enable you to apply opacity settings, blend modes, 
and layer styles to multiple layers at a time.
 
 To create a layer group, click the Create a New Group icon (the folder 
icon) at the bottom of the Layers panel, shown in Figure 2-8. You can 
also select New Group from the Layers panel pop-up menu or choose 
Figure 2-7: Color-coding layers helps to visually 
identify and organize your layers.

395
Book V
Chapter 2
Managing Layers
Creating Layer Groups
Layer➪New➪Group. The latter 
two methods prompt you for a 
group name in addition to a few 
other options (similar to regular 
layers). You can color-code your 
group and specify a blend mode 
and opacity setting. Note that the 
default mode is Pass Through, 
which lets the blend modes 
applied to the individual layers 
remain intact. If you select any 
other mode, that mode overrides 
all the layers in the group.
After you create your group, drag 
your layers into the group folder 
in the Layers panel. If the group is 
collapsed when you drag or if you 
drag a layer on top of the group 
icon itself, Photoshop places the 
layer at the bottom of the layer 
group. If the group is expanded, 
you can drag the layer to a spe-
cific location within the group. 
To collapse or expand the group, 
click the triangle icon to the left 
of the folder icon.
Although layer groups are pretty straightforward, keep these few points 
in mind:
 
✓ Like with regular layers, you can select, duplicate, show, hide, lock, and 
rearrange layer groups. See other sections in this chapter for more on 
these commands.
 
✓ You can nest layer groups. Create (or drag) one layer group into another 
layer group.
 
✓ You can create a layer group from selected layers. Select the layers 
that you want to be in a group, and then select New Group from Layers 
from the Layers panel pop-up menu or choose Layer➪New➪Group from 
Layers. Name the group in the dialog box that appears and click OK.
 
✓ If you select a layer within a group and then choose Layer➪Arrange, the 
command applies to the stacking order only within the layer group.
 
✓ You can merge layer groups. Select the group and select Merge Group 
from the Layers panel pop-up menu or choose Layer➪Merge Group. For 
more on merging, see the following section.

Flattening and Merging Layers
 
✓ You can rename your group by double-clicking the group name in the 
Layers panel. You can also choose Layer➪Group Properties or select 
Group Properties from the Layers panel pop-up menu.
 
✓ In addition, you can lock layers within a group. Select Lock All Layers 
in Group from the Layers panel pop-up menu or choose Layer➪Lock All 
Layers in Group.
Flattening and Merging Layers
Being the true layers evangelist that I am, I tout the glories of layers in the first 
two chapters of this minibook. And layers are wonderful. But they do have a 
dark side. They can make your file go from slim and trim to bulky and bloated. 
You not only get a larger file size that slows your computer system perfor-
mance, but you’re also limited to the file formats that allow you to save layers: 
Photoshop’s native format (.psd), TIFF (.tif), Large Document Format 
(.psb), and PDF (.pdf). If you save your file in any other format, Photoshop 
smashes your layers down into a background. This file limitation often forces 
users to save two versions of every layered file — one as a native Photoshop 
file and one as something else, such as EPS or JPEG, to import into another 
program. For more on file formats, see Book II, Chapter 2. To curb large file 
sizes or use layered images in a wider range of formats, you have a couple of 
options:
 
✓ Merging layers: Combines visible, linked, or adjacent layers into a 
single layer (not a background). The intersection of all transparent 
areas is retained. You can merge layers or layer groups. You can also 
merge adjustment or fill layers (see Book V, Chapter 1 for details), but 
they can’t act as the target layer for the merge. Merging layers can help 
decrease your file size and make your document more manageable. 
You’re still restricted to the layer-friendly file formats, however.
 
✓ Flattening an image: Combines all visible layers into a background. 
Photoshop deletes hidden layers and fills any transparent areas with 
white. Flattening is usually reserved for when you’re completely finished 
editing your image.
 
When you convert an image from one color mode to another, that conver-
sion may cause the file to flatten. Look out for the warning dialog box that 
prompts you of this result, and go back and save a copy of your file as a 
native Photoshop file, thereby preserving your layers. See Book II, Chapter 2 
for details about color modes.

Merging layers
You can merge your layers several ways. To use the first option, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Ensure that all the layers (and layer groups) that you want to merge 
are visible, as shown in Figure 2-9.
Photo Disc
Figure 2-9: Merging layers can make your file size a lot smaller.
 
2. Choose Merge Visible from the Layers panel pop-up menu or the Layer 
menu.
 
 All visible layers are smushed into a single layer, as shown in Figure 2-9.
 
Hold down Alt (Option on the Mac) when choosing Layer➪Merge Visible. 
Photoshop merges those layers onto a new layer.
You can also merge layers by following these steps:
 
1. Position the layer or layer groups that you want to merge adjacent to 
each other in the Layers panel.
 
2. Select the top layer of those you want merged.
 
3. Choose Merge Down from the Layers panel pop-up menu or the Layer 
menu.
 
 If the top layer is a layer group, the command is called Merge Group.
 
 Note that Merge Down merges your selected layer with the layer directly 
below it.

398
Flattening and Merging Layers
Flattening layers
To flatten an image, follow these steps:
 
1. Ensure that all the layers you want to retain are visible.
 
 Photoshop discards all hidden layers.
 
2. Choose Layer➪Flatten Image or select Flatten Image from the Layers 
panel pop-up menu.
 
 The transparent areas of your flattened image 
are filled with the background color and 
appear as a background layer in the Layers 
panel, as shown in Figure 2-10.
 
 Note that Photoshop doesn’t prompt you with 
a warning like, “Are you sure you really want 
to do this?” But if you mistakenly flatten your 
image, you can undo the command immedi-
ately by choosing Edit➪Undo. If you go ahead 
and perform another action, then undo your 
mistake by using the History panel. However, 
note that if the flattening step is no longer in 
the History panel, there’s no way to undo the 
flattening. See Book II, Chapter 4 for the scoop 
on the History panel.

layers only if you’re

Putting It Together
Checking Your Collage for Flaws and Consolidating Layers
When you begin a project, you may think you know what you want the ﬁ nal result to look 
like. But when your creative juices start ﬂ owing, you may decide that something doesn’t 
look right. For example, while I was working on my collage, I discovered that the sky 
behind and above the canyon was a little on the ordinary side.
 
1. Open the saved collage ﬁ le and open a new 
image that you want to incorporate into the 
collage.
 
 In my example, I thought the sky needed some 
kick, so I opened an image that contained a sky 
I liked.
 
2. Select the part of the image that you want to 
Photo Disc

Chapter 2
Managing Layers
Flattening and Merging Layers
add to your collage, as shown in the ﬁ gure.
 
 Most of the time, consistency is key. In my example, however, I didn’t need to 
feather the image. Because I’m going to paste it into the old sky, the edges of the 
element won’t be seen.
 
3. Choose Edit➪Copy.
 
4. In the collage image, select the portion of the image into which you want to paste 
your copied element.
 
 Because I’m pasting the image into the background image, I ﬁ rst needed to make 
the selection I wanted to paste into. I used the Magic Wand tool. After a couple of 
additional Shift-clicks, I selected the entire sky behind the canyon.
 
5. Choose Edit➪Paste Into.
 
 The element you copied (in my case, the new sky) appears inside the selected area 
of your collage, as shown in the ﬁ gure.
When you’re close to ﬁ nalizing your collage, you might want to consolidate layers. Mini-
mizing the number of layers makes projects easier to manage and your ﬁ le size smaller, 
which is great when you get ready to add the ﬁ nishing touches to your collage.
 
Be sure that before you merge your layers, you’ll never have to manipulate them sepa-
rately, especially if the elements on the layer overlap each other, as mine do.
To consolidate two layers, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the layers in the Layers panel.
 
2. Select Merge Layers from the Layers panel pop-up menu.
 
 The two layers merge and become one.
 
3. Choose File➪Save.

Working with the Layer Comps Panel
Working with the Layer Comps Panel
The Layer Comps feature doesn’t really add more layer functionality, but 
because it shares a similar moniker, I explain it in this minibook.
What Layer Comps does do is enable you to create and save multiple ver-
sions of your project within a single master file. Through the Layer Comps 
panel, Photoshop records all the vital statistics of your layers, including 
their visibility, position, and blending options. These statistics come in 
handy when you want to show a client or art director various design ver-
sions within a single document. That’s right: No longer do you have to save 
the various renditions of a design or project in multiple files. Just be aware 
that layer comps do add to your file size.
The following steps walk you through the day-to-day operation of the Layer 
Comps panel:
 
1. Choose Window➪Layer Comps to display the panel, shown in 
Figure 2-11.

2. Create all your desired layer content.
 
 Note that if you perform all your editing on just a background layer, you 
can’t save the document as a layer comp.
 
 3. When you have a version of the document that you want to save as a 
comp, click the New Layer Comp button at the bottom of the panel or 
select New Layer Comp from the panel pop-up menu.
 
 The New Layer Comp dialog box appears.
 
 To create a comp and bypass the options dialog box, hold down the Alt 
(Option on the Mac) key when you click the New Layer Comp button.
 
4. Name your layer comp and 
select the attributes you want 
recorded — Visibility, Position, 
and Appearance (Layer Style) 
of the layers. Click OK.
 
 You can also add an optional 
comment about the configura-
tion you’re capturing, as shown in 
Figure 2-12.
 
 Note that if you add a comment, 
you see a triangle just to the left 
of the layer comp name (refer to the sunflower solo comp shown in 
Figure 2-11). Click the triangle to see your comment in the panel.
 
5. Continue creating your various configurations of the document, cap-
turing a layer comp after each.
 
6. To display a particular layer comp, click in the left column in the 
Layer Comps panel.
 
 A document icon appears, which indicates that particular layer comp is 
selected.
 
7. To efficiently cycle through all your layer comps, click the Apply Next 
Selected Layer Comp or Apply Previous Selected Layer Comp icon 
(the arrows) at the bottom of the Layer Comps panel.
 
 You can also, less efficiently, apply layer comps by selecting the particu-
lar layer comp and selecting Apply Layer Comp from the panel pop-up 
menu. The document icon moves to that layer, and Photoshop displays 
that layer comp.
Here are a few more Layer Comp tidbits:
 
✓ To rename a layer comp: Simply double-click its name in the panel.
 
 ✓ To delete a layer comp: Select it and click the trash can icon in the 
Layer Comps panel. You can also drag the layer comp to the trash can 
icon or select Delete Layer Comp from the panel pop-up menu.
Figure 2-12: Add project details in the 
Comment field of the New Layer Comp 
dialog box.

Working with the Layer Comps Panel
 
✓ To duplicate a layer comp: Select it and drag it onto the New Layer 
Comp icon in the panel or select Duplicate Layer Comp from the panel 
pop-up menu.
 
 ✓ To update a particular layer comp with the currently active configura-
tion of the document: Select the layer comp, and then select Update 
Layer Comp from the panel pop-up menu or click the Update Layer 
Comp button at the bottom of the panel.
 
✓ To display your document at its latest configuration (but not neces-
sarily the latest saved layer comp): Select Restore Last Document State 
from the panel pop-up or simply click in the column to the left of the 
Last Document State item in the Layer Comps panel.
 
✓ To rearrange the order of the layer comps: Simply drag it to a new 
location in the panel.
To output your layer comps, choose File➪Scripts➪Layer Comps to Files.Select 
this command to make Photoshop export your layer comps to individual files. 
In the dialog box that appears, shown in Figure 2-13, provide a destination 
and prefix name for your file. Indicate whether you want to include Selected 
Layer Comps Only (you must select 
them before you choose the com-
mand). Leave that option deselected 
to have Photoshop export all layer 
comps. Then, choose your desired file 
type and specify whether you want 
to include ICC Profiles (see Book II, 
Chapter 2) and Maximize Compatibility 
(see Book I, Chapter 5). Click Run and 
then sit back and watch the magic 
happen.
 
Note that the Layer Comps to PDF 
and Layer Comps to WPG (Web 
Photo Gallery) commands have been 
removed from the Scripts submenu. 
Both have been replaced by the Adobe 
Output Module in Adobe Bridge. For 
more on creating PDFs and Web galler-
ies, see Book I, Chapter 4.

Chapter 3: Playing with Opacity 
and Blend Modes
In This Chapter

✓ Applying blend modes for effects
✓ Setting the blend options
I
n this chapter, I show you how to let down your hair and get those cre-
ative juices flowing. Yes, I’m about to say the “F” word: Fun.
This chapter, along with Book V, Chapter 4, focuses on how to tweak the 
layers you’ve made. Maybe you want to make one of your layers semi-
transparent so that you can see the layer beneath it; or say you want 
to try blending the colors between a couple layers in a way 
that’s slightly offbeat. Look no further.
Although some techniques in this chapter may reek 
of complexity, keep in mind that you don’t need to 
totally understand them. Take these techniques 
as far as you want. And remember, there’s no 
substitute for good old experimentation. Before 
you jump into these techniques, it helps to have a 
handle on the methods of layer creation and man-
agement that I explain in Book V, Chapters 1 and 2.
Adjusting Layer Opacity
By far one of the easiest ways to make your image look 
oh-so sophisticated is to have one image ghosted over another, 
as shown in Figure 3-1. Creating this effect is a snap with the Opacity 
option in the Layers panel. You adjust the opacity in two ways:
 
✓ Select your desired layer in the Layers panel. Then, either access the 
slider by clicking the right-pointing arrow or enter a percentage value in 
the Opacity text box.
 
✓ You can also double-click a layer thumbnail, choose Layer➪Layer Style➪
Blending Options, or select Blending Options from the Layers panel pop-up 
menu. (Click the triangle in the upper-right corner to open the menu.)

404
Adjusting Layer Opacity
Any of these methods brings up the Layer Style dialog box, where you can 
enter a value or drag the slider for opacity.
The Opacity setting allows you to mix the active layer with the layers below 
it in varying percentages from 100% (completely opaque) to 0% (completely 
transparent). Remember that you can adjust the opacity only on a layer, not 
a background.
 
You can also change the Opacity percentage by using keyboard shortcuts. 
With any tool active, except a painting or editing tool, press a number key. 
Press 5 for 50 percent, 25 for 25 percent. If you’re entering a two-digit value, 
just be sure you type the numbers quickly, or else Photoshop interprets the 
numbers as two different values. You get the picture. Note that for the 
default of 100 percent, you must press 0.
Figure 3-1: Adjusting the opacity enables one image to ghost over another.

405
Book V
Chapter 3
Playing with 
Opacity and 
Blend Modes
Creating Effects with Blend Modes
Adjusting the Fill Opacity
In addition to adjusting the regular opac-
ity for a layer, you can also adjust the 
fill opacity. Fill opacity works a little 
differently from regular opacity. The 
regular Opacity setting affects layer 
styles (see Book V, Chapter 4) and blend 
modes (see the following section) that 
have been applied to the layer. Fill opac-
ity, however, affects only the pixels or 
shapes that reside on the layer. It doesn’t 
affect the styles or blends. As you can 
see in Figure 3-2, the drop shadow and 
emboss styles in the bottom example 
show through full strength.
To adjust the Fill Opacity setting, 
select your desired layer in the Layers 
panel, then enter a value in the Fill 
Opacity text box or drag the pop-up slider. The other methods for adjusting 
fill opacity are similar to the regular opacity option.
Creating Effects with Blend Modes
Photoshop’s 25 blend modes (27 when you work with the painting and edit-
ing tools) determine how the colors in different layers interact with each 
other. Blend modes can produce a multitude of interesting, sometimes even 
bizarre, effects. And what’s more, you can easily apply, change, or discard 
blend modes with no permanent damage to your layers.
Most options in the Blend Mode pop-up menu (located under the Layers tab) 
in the Layers panel are the same as those on the Mode pop-up menu on the 
Options bar. The exceptions are the Behind and Clear modes, which you 
can find only on the Options bar because they’re available only for use with 
painting and editing tools.
 
I urge you to pick an image with a few layers and apply each blend mode to 
get a good handle on what the various blend modes do. In fact, try a few dif-
ferent images because the effects may be subtle or intense, depending on 
the colors in the image. Throw in some different opacity percentages, and 
you’re on your way to endless hours of creative fun.
 
You’ll find these modes called blend modes, painting modes, brush modes, 
layer modes, calculations, or just plain modes. They’re usually referred to as 
blend modes or layer modes when used with layers and painting modes, and 
brush modes when used in conjunction with a painting or editing tool.
Figure 3-2: Fill opacity (bottom) affects only 
layer pixels, not styles or blend modes that 
have been applied to the layer.

General blend modes
In the General category, you find the following modes, which are shown in 
Figure 3-3 and explained in Table 3-1.
Table 3-1 
General Blend Modes
Blend Mode
Description
Normal
You’re probably very familiar with the Normal blend mode by 
now. It’s the default that lets each pixel appear in its very own 
unadulterated state. The other three modes are used only in cer-
tain circumstances.
Dissolve
The effects of Dissolve can be seen only with a layer that has an 
opacity setting of less than 100% — the lower the opacity, the 
more intense the effect. The effect is created by allowing some 
pixels from lower layers, which are randomized, to show through 
the target layer.
Behind
Available only when you have a painting or editing tool active. 
Type must be rasterized, and Lock Transparency must be dese-
lected. Allows you to edit or paint only on the transparent areas of 
the layer, giving the illusion that the strokes are behind the layer.
Clear
Available only when you have a painting or editing tool active. 
Type must be rasterized, and Lock Transparency must be dese-
lected. Allows you to edit or paint with transparency, giving the 
appearance that holes are being punched into your image.

Blend modes that darken
Overall, the blend modes in this category all produce effects that darken 
your image, as shown in Figure 3-4. However, one of my favorite uses for the 
Darken blend mode is a little different. Scan a handwritten letter or sheet of 
music and layer it over an image. Apply the Darken blend mode to the letter 
or sheet-music layer. The white areas of the paper become transparent, and 
only the letters or musical notes display, creating a nice composite image. 
Table 3-2 describes these modes.

Description
Darken
If the pixels on the layer are lighter than those below, the lighter 
pixels turn transparent. If the pixels on the layer are darker, they 
appear unchanged. A great mode for superimposing scanned 
text or line art because it allows the white color of the paper to 
essentially drop out, leaving only the dark letters or lines.

408
Creating Effects with Blend Modes
Table 3-2 (continued)
Blend Mode
Description
Multiply
Burns the layer into the layers underneath. The Multiply mode 
darkens all colors where they mix. With layers, it’s comparable 
to sticking two slides in the same slot in a slide projector. If 
painting, each successive stroke creates a darker color, as if 
drawing with markers.
Color Burn
Darkens the layers underneath and burns them 
with color. Increases contrast. Blending with white pixels has 
no effect. Like applying a dark dye to your image.
Linear Burn
Darkens the layers underneath by decreasing the brightness. 
Similar to Multiply but tends to make portions of your image 
pure black. Blending with white pixels has no effect.
Darker Color
When blending two layers, the darker of the two colors will be 
visible.
Blend modes that lighten
If you have blend modes that darken, well, having modes that lighten just 
makes good sense. So, if you have the need to throw some digital bleach on 
your brightly colored pixels, try out a couple of these blend modes, which I 
describe in Table 3-3. Figure 3-5 shows examples of these effects.
Table 3-3 
Blend Modes That Lighten
Blend Mode
Description
Lighten
If the pixels on the layer are darker than those below, the darker 
pixels turn transparent. If the pixels on the layer are lighter, they 
appear unchanged. The opposite of Darken.
Screen
Lightens the layer where it mixes with the layer underneath. 
Blending with black pixels has no effect. Like putting two slides 
in two different projectors and pointing them at the same 
screen. The opposite of Multiply.
Color Dodge 
Lightens the pixels in the layers underneath and infuses them 
with colors from the top layer. Like bleaching your layer. 
Blending with black pixels has no effect.
Linear Dodge 
(Add)
Lightens the layers underneath by increasing the brightness. 
Similar to Screen but tends to make parts of your image pure 
white. Blending with black pixels has no effect.
Lighter Color
When blending two layers, the lighter of the two colors will be 
visible.

Lighting blend modes
This group of blend modes plays with the lighting in your layers. Some of 
these blend modes, such as Pin Light, are 
reserved for the occasional wacky special 
effect. The following list and images explain 
and show each mode:
 
✓ Overlay: Multiplies the dark pixels in the 
top layer and screens the light pixels in the 
underlying layers. Enhances the contrast 
and saturation of colors.
 
✓ Soft Light: Darkens the dark pixels and 
lightens the light pixels. If the pixels on 
the top layer are lighter than 50% gray, the 
lighter pixels are lightened further. If the 
pixels on the top layer are darker than 50% 
gray, the mode darkens pixels. Blending 
with black or white results in darker or 
lighter pixels, but doesn’t make parts of 
Overlay

your image pure black or pure white. Similar to Overlay, but softer and 
subtler. Like shining a soft spotlight on the image.
 
✓ Hard Light: Multiplies the dark pixels and 
screens the light pixels. Like shining a bright, 
hard spotlight on the image. If the pixels on 
the top layer are lighter than 50% gray, they’re 
screened. If the pixels on the top layer are 
darker than 50% gray, the mode multiplies the 
pixels. Can be used to add highlights and 
shadows to an image. Blending with black or 
white gives you black and white.
 
✓ Vivid Light: If the pixels on the top layer are 
darker than 50% gray, this mode burns (or 
darkens) the colors by increasing the contrast. 
If the pixels on the top layer are lighter than 50% 
gray, the mode dodges (or lightens) the colors by 
decreasing the contrast. A combination of Color 
Burn and Color Dodge.
 
✓ Linear Light: If the pixels on the top layer are 
darker than 50% gray, the mode burns (or 
darkens) the colors by decreasing the bright-
ness. If the pixels on the top layer are lighter 
than 50% gray, the mode dodges (or lightens) 
the colors by increasing the brightness. A 
combination of Linear Burn and Linear Dodge.
 
✓ Pin Light: Replaces the colors of pixels, 
depending on the colors in the top layer. If the 
pixels on the top layer are darker than 50% 
gray, the mode replaces pixels darker than 
those on the top layer and doesn’t change 
lighter pixels. If the pixels on the top layer are 
lighter than 50% gray, the mode replaces the 
pixels that are lighter than those pixels on the 
top layer and doesn’t change pixels that are 
darker. A combination of Darken and Lighten; 
useful for special effects.
 
✓ Hard Mix: Similar to Vivid Light, but reduces 
the colors to a total of eight — cyan, magenta, 
yellow, black, red, green, blue, and white. 
Although the results depend on the mix of 
existing colors on the top and bottom layers, 
this mode usually creates a highly posterized 
effect.

Blend modes that invert
If the blend modes discussed in the preceding sections are a tad too tame 
for you, you may want to check out the inverters — Difference and Exclusion 
(described in Table 3-4). These blend modes invert your colors and can pro-
duce some interesting special effects, as shown in Figure 3-6.
Table 3-4 
Blend Modes That Invert
Blend Mode
Description
Difference
Produces a negative, or inverted, effect according to the 
brightness values on the top layers. If the pixels on the top 
layer are black, the mode doesn’t change the colors of the 
underlying layers. If the pixels on the top layer are white, the 
mode inverts the colors of the underlying layers. Can produce 
bizarre results.
Exclusion
Similar to Difference, but with less contrast and saturation. 
If the pixels on the top layer are black, the mode doesn’t 
change the colors of the underlying layers. If the pixels on the 
top layer are white, the mode inverts the colors of the under-
lying layers. Medium colors blend to create gray.
Exclusion
Difference
Figure 3-6: The Difference and Exclusion blend modes invert colors.
HSL color model blend modes
These blend modes use the HSL (Hue Saturation Lightness) color model to 
mix colors. My favorite blend mode in this group is Color, which allows you 
to apply color to images without obscuring the tonality. The Color mode is 
great for “hand painting” grayscale images. See details on this technique in 
Book IV, Chapter 1. Table 3-5 lists these modes, and Figure 3-7 shows their 
effects.

HSL Color Model Blend Modes
Blend Mode
Description
Hue
Blends the luminance (brightness) and saturation 
(intensity of the color) of the underlying layers with the 
hue (color) of the top layer.
Saturation
Blends the luminance and hue of the underlying layers 
with the saturation of the top layer.
Color
Blends the luminance of the underlying layers with the 
saturation and hue of the top layer. This mode is great 
for colorizing grayscale (with a color mode set to RGB) 
images because it preserves the shadows, highlights, 
and details of the underlying layers.
Luminosity
Blends the hue and saturation of the underlying layers 
with the luminance of the top layer. Preserves the 
shadows, highlights, and details from the top layer and 
mixes them with the colors of the underlying layers. The 
opposite of Color.
 
The following blend modes work with 8-, 16-, and 32-bit images: Normal, 
Dissolve, Darken, Multiply, Lighten, Linear Dodge, Difference, Hue, 
Saturation, Color, Luminosity, Lighter Color, Darker Color.

Working with the Advanced Blending Options
If you want to get serious about layers, then you need to know about the 
Advanced Blending Options, which you can find in the Layer Style dialog 
box. These options allow you to tailor the way your layer styles and blend 
modes interact with your layers. Getting to the advanced options is just like 
accessing opacity and blend modes: You can double-click a layer thumbnail, 
choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Blending Options, or select Blending Options 
from the Layers panel pop-up menu. The massive Layer Style dialog box 
rears its multi-paneled head, as shown in Figure 3-8.
Figure 3-8: The Layer Styles dialog box is home to Advanced 
Blending Options.
(By the way, if you’re ready to know more about these blending features, skip 
to Book V, Chapter 4, where I cover layer styles.)
Advanced options to blend with
The advanced options aren’t for the faint of heart. To be frank, the options 
are, well, advanced, so you might find them a tad too eggheady for your 
taste. But if not, here you go:
 
✓ Fill Opacity: I cover this in the section “Adjusting the Fill Opacity,” 
earlier in this chapter.

414
Working with the Advanced Blending Options
 
✓ Channels: This option allows you to restrict your blending options to 
specific channels only. For all you need to know about working with 
channels, check out Book VI.
 
✓ Knockout: This option allows you 
to specify which layers have holes 
in them so that you can view the 
layers underneath. You first have 
to use the Fill Opacity option to set 
the opacity of the knockout. The 
lower the opacity, the more the 
hole shows; therefore, set it to 0% 
(like in my example in Figure 3-9) 
to see all the way through. Set the 
Knockout to Shallow to create a 
hole through one layer group (see 
Book V, Chapter 2) or a clipping 
group (see Book V, Chapter 4). Set 
the Knockout to Deep to create 
a hole all the way through to the 
background. If you’re working with 
just layers, and not layer groups 
or clipping groups, the knockout 
cuts through to the background. 
If there’s no background, it cuts 
through to transparency.
 
✓ Blend Interior Effects as Group: 
This option applies the blend mode of the layer to interior layer effects, 
such as inner glows, satin, and color overlay, and so on. Deselect this 
option to prevent the blend mode from affecting the layer effects. You 
can see the difference in Figure 3-10.
 
✓ Blend Clipped Layers as Group: The blend mode of the bottom layer in 
the clipping group affects all the other layers in the group. Deselect this 
option to make each layer retain its own blend mode and appearance.
 
✓ Transparency Shapes Layer: Confines layer effects and knockouts to 
opaque areas of a layer. Deselect this option to apply the mode’s layer 
effects and knockouts to the entire layer. (See Figure 3-11.)
 
✓ Layer Mask Hides Effects: Confines layer effects to the area designated 
by the layer mask. (For more on layer masks, see Book VI, Chapter 3.)
 
✓ Vector Mask Hides Effects: Confines layer effects to the visible area des-
ignated by a vector mask, as shown in Figure 3-12. (For more on vector 
masks, see Book VI, Chapter 3.)

layers to enable you to view the layers 
underneath.

Blend If options
By using the slider bars, you can specify which colors are visible in the 
active layer and which colors show through from the underlying layers. You 
can select a specific channel from the Blend If pop-up menu to apply the 
option to a single channel. The default channel of Gray affects all channels in 
the image. The two sliders at the bottom of the Layer Style dialog box do the 
following:
 
✓ This Layer: Allows you to set a blending range. In other words, you 
can hide certain colors according to the brightness values in the active 
layer. By dragging the black triangle to the right, you exclude darker 
colors. By dragging the white triangle to the left, you exclude lighter 
colors.
 
✓ Underlying Layers: Forces the colors from the underlying layers to 
show through the active layer. Again, dragging the black and white tri-
angles excludes ranges of colors.
 
Excluding and forcing colors can result in some harsh color transitions. You 
can provide for a smoother transition between blended and unblended areas 
by splitting the slider into two parts, allowing the pixels to gradually fade to 
transparency. Alt-drag (Option-drag on the Mac) on either the black or white 
triangle in either slider bar to split the triangle into two halves. The left and 
right triangles mark the beginning and end of the blending range, where 
pixels fade into or out of view.

Putting It Together
Fine-Tuning and Adjusting Opacity Settings in Your Collage
If you’ve followed along with the Putting It Together projects I discuss in Book V, Chap-
ters 1 and 2, you may have a collage that you’re pretty satisﬁ ed with. You just need to 
make the ﬁ nal tweaks and then go to sleep (or get home to your spouse and children).
One of the most important tweaks you can make is to opacity. Follow these steps to 
adjust the opacity settings on some of the layers:
 
1. Open your saved collage ﬁ le.
 
 If the Layers panel isn’t already visible, open it.
 
2. Select a layer in your collage and move the opacity slider to the left or right.
 
 If you want the layer to be more opaque, move the slider to the right. If you’re inter-
ested in making the layer more transparent, move the slider to the left.
 
 I chose Layer 4 and adjusted the opacity to 75%. I like the blue sky in my collage, 
but it’s a tad too vibrant in comparison to the rest of the image. Adjusting the opacity 
tones it down and allows the blue to blend in more naturally.
 
3. Save the ﬁ le and move on to the next layer you want to adjust.
 
 If you have more complicated opacity settings to adjust, keep reading.

continued
 
4. Select the background layer and then select Duplicate Layer from the Layers panel 
pop-up menu. Click OK to close the Duplicate Layer dialog box.
 
 Making a copy of the background is great because it allows you to add a blend 
mode, like you do in Step 5, and then adjust it to get just the right amount of the 
effect.
 
 For example, if you want to deﬁ ne an element in your collage, but applying it directly 
on the layer makes the effect too intense, make a copy of the layer. I wanted to 
pump up the deﬁ nition of the canyon in my collage, but when I used the blend mode 
directly on the background, the result looked too harsh.
 
 By the way, I couldn’t resist the urge to include a pair of hiking boots in my collage.
 
5. Select the background copy layer and select a mode (such as Vivid Light) from the 
Mode pop-up menu in the Layers panel.
 
 The deﬁ nition likely looks great, but the contrast is over the top.
 
6. Adjust the opacity to tone it down.
 
 I changed the opacity in mine to 35%.
 
7. When you’re satisﬁ ed with the opacity and contrast, save the collage ﬁ le.

A
fter you have all the basic elements in your layered composite image, 
you may want to give it a little pizzazz and finesse. Maybe a headline 
would pop out a little more if you beveled the edge, or maybe that silhou-
etted image would take on a little more dimension if you placed a drop 
shadow behind it. This chapter is where you find out how to do 
that and more. (If you’re wondering how to create a com-
posite image with layers, see Book V, Chapters 1, 2, and 
3, which introduce the basics of creating composites 
with layers.)
Layer Styles Basics
In the old days, creating a drop shadow in 
Photoshop took a concerted effort. And bev-
eled or embossed type? Well, I’ll just say that 
you really had to have the inside scoop on some 
Photoshop tricks. Now, however, Photoshop makes 
creating these kinds of effects as easy as selecting an 
option.
 
In this chapter, you may see the terms effect and style used 
interchangeably. Technically, however, Adobe says that after layer 
effects are applied to a layer, they become part of a layer’s style. You can 
save and load styles, but not effects. So, if you apply a bunch of effects and 
want to be able to easily re-create the look, save it as a style.
When you get started with layer effects and styles, keep the following tips in 
mind:
 
✓ You can apply layer effects to regular layers, shape layers, fill layers, and 
type layers, but not to backgrounds, completely locked layers, or layer 

420
Introducing the Many Layer Styles
groups. For more on backgrounds, see Book V, Chapter 1. For details on 
locking layers and creating layer groups, see Book V, Chapter 2.
 
✓ Layer effects are dynamically linked to the contents of a layer. If you 
move or edit the contents of the layers, the effects are updated.
 
✓ When you apply effects, they become part of the layer’s style. A styled 
layer has an fx symbol next to the layer’s name in the Layers panel. You 
can expand (to view the individual effects) or collapse the layer style by 
clicking the triangle icon next to the florin.
 
✓ If you create a style so fantastic that you want to save it for later use, 
you can save a custom style as a preset and store it in the Styles panel 
(see the section “Saving your own style,” later in this chapter).
 
✓ Feel free to cut loose and have some fun. Layer styles are completely 
nondestructive. They don’t muck around with your actual pixel data. If 
you don’t like them, edit them. If you really don’t like them, delete them 
to go back to your original unstylized image.
Introducing the Many Layer Styles
Layer effects fall into a few categories. You can add shadows, glow effects, 
beveled and embossed edges, and overlay colors and patterns, and you can, 
of course, tweak to your heart’s content. This list introduces the various 
effects that you can apply (in the following sections, I explain how you apply 
each layer style and tweak its settings):
 
✓ Shadows: Add a soft drop or inner shadow to the contents of a layer. 
You can adjust the blend mode, color, opacity, angle, size, and contour 
to suit your needs. Figure 4-1 shows examples of both types of shadows.

Introducing the Many Layer Styles
 
✓ Glows: Add a soft highlight that appears on the outside or inside edges 
of the contents of a layer, as shown in Figure 4-2. Like shadows, you can 
fine-tune the appearance by adjusting numerous options.
 
✓ Bevels: Create a 3-D edge on either the outside or inside edges of the 
contents of a layer, giving the element some dimension. Similarly, 
emboss effects make elements appear raised off or punched into the 
page. Satin creates a satiny or draped fabric effect over your element. 
All these effects (shown in Figure 4-3) offer numerous options to adjust 
their appearances.

Applying a Layer Effect
 
✓ Overlays: Apply a fill of color, a gradient, or a pattern over the contents 
of your layer, as shown in Figure 4-4. You can adjust the opacity of the 
overlay, among other options, so that your original element shows 
through more clearly. You can also surround your layer with a stroke 
consisting of a color, gradient, or pattern.

2. Choose Layer➪Layer Style and choose an effect from the submenu.
 
 You can also click the Layer Style icon in the Layers panel and select an 
effect from the pop-up menu.
 
 An intimidating Layer Style dialog box with a ton of options rears its 
head, as shown in Figure 4-5.
 
3. Select the Preview check box on the right of the dialog box so you can 
see your effects while you apply them.

4. To accept the default settings, just click OK.
 
 Or you can experiment with the settings.
 
 You can use sliders or check boxes, enter values in the text boxes, and 
so on. The following sections in this chapter describe the options and 
settings in detail.
 
5. If you refine your effect settings, click OK when you finish.
 
 Photoshop applies your effect to your layer, as indicated by the fx icon.
Managing and Editing Layer Styles
You can always just apply the layer effect with Photoshop’s default settings, 
but what fun is that? To edit a style, double-click the Effect name or the 
Effects label, double-click the layer thumbnail or double-click the Layer Style 
icon in the Layers panel, and make your desired adjustments in the Layer 
Style dialog box. If you double-clicked the layer thumbnail or the icon, be 
sure to select your desired effect from the left side of the dialog box to get 
access to your effect’s settings.

424
Managing and Editing Layer Styles
The following sections give you the details on each of the options. But a pic-
ture is worth a thousand words. Experiment to see these effects come alive.
Managing layer styles
Here are a few pointers to keep in mind when working with and editing layer 
styles:
 
✓ Choose several effects at one time. Simply select the check box for 
the effect on the left side of the Layer Style dialog box. To access the 
options for each effect, you must click the effect name so that it’s 
highlighted.
 
✓ Remove an effect. Deselect the check box associated with it.
 
✓ Move a style onto a separate layer. By default, layer styles are attached 
to a layer. To put a style on a separate layer, select the styled layer and 
choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Create Layer. You see a new layer in the 
Layers panel with a name, such as Layer 0’s Drop Shadow.
 
 Although separating a style onto its own layer may give you more 
manual editing capability and allow you to apply filters, you lose all edit-
ing ability with the Layer Style dialog box. Also, the style won’t dynami-
cally update when you change the layer itself. Your style basically 
becomes just a generic mass of colored pixels.
 
✓ Copy and paste effects onto other layers. Select the layer containing the 
effect and choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Copy Layer Style. Select the layer 
or layers on which you want to apply the effect and choose Layer➪Layer 
Style➪Paste Layer Style. Even easier, you can also just hold down the Alt 
(Option on the Mac) key and then drag and drop an effect from one layer 
to another.
 
✓ Hide effects. Choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Hide All Effects to hide all 
effects on the image, not just the selected layer.
 
✓ Display hidden effects. Choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Show All Effects.
 
✓ Remove all the effects on a layer. Choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Clear 
Layer Style. You can also drag the Effects bar (what Adobe calls the 
name Effects) or fx icon to the trash icon in the Layers panel.
 
✓ Remove a single effect. Simply drag and drop the single effect to the 
trash icon in the Layers panel.
 
✓ Resize a layer effect. Select your desired layer in the Layers panel. 
Choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Scale Effects. Select Preview and enter a 
value between 1 and 1,000 percent. This command allows you to scale 
the effect without scaling the element.

Editing drop shadow or inner shadow effects
If you used the default settings to apply your drop shadow or inner shadow 
and want to do some tweaking, edit by following these steps:
 
1. In the Layers panel, double-click the Effect name.
 
 Or you can double-click the layer thumbnail or the Layer Style icon (fx 
icon).
 
 The Layer Style dialog box opens. If you double-clicked the layer thumb-
nail or the Layer Style icon, you need to click the Drop Shadow or Inner 
Shadow name on the left side of the dialog box.
 
2. Change the Blend Mode setting to adjust how the colors of the shadow 
mix with the colors of your elements.
 
 Usually, the default mode of Multiply works best.
 
3. Adjust the Opacity setting to change how transparent the shadow 
appears.
 
4. To select a shadow color, open the Color Picker by clicking the swatch 
to the right of the Blend Mode setting.
 
5. Establish the angle of your light source.
 
6. Select the Use Global Light option to ensure that all the shadows and 
highlights of all your elements are consistent.
 
 You don’t want one layer to look like it’s 6 a.m. and another to look like 
it’s 2 p.m. The neat thing is that if you change the angle on one layer 
style, all the styles (with the Use Global Light option selected) you’ve 
applied to your layers adjust to that new angle dynamically.
 
7. Specify how far the shadow is offset from your element with the 
Distance setting.
 
8. Adjust the Spread, Choke, and Size settings to specify the boundary, 
intensity, and size of the shadow.
 
9. Select the Layer Knocks Out Drop Shadow option if you have a trans-
parent object on top of the shadow.
 
 This option prevents the shadow from showing through the object.
 
10. After you refine your effect settings, click OK.
 
 Your effect is edited and ready to go, as shown in Figure 4-6.
 
 You can also choose to apply various contours and noise to your 
shadow. See the section “Playing with Contours,” later in this chapter, 
for details.

Changing default inner and outer glow effects
The inner and outer glow effects possess many of the same settings as the 
shadows. But unlike shadows, glows offer the option of using a gradient, 
which can produce an interesting halo effect, as shown in Figure 4-7.
PhotoSpin
Figure 4-7: Colorize a glow with a gradient.
Follow these steps to edit your own glow:

2. Click the name of the Effect and specify Blend Mode, Opacity, Color, 
Spread, and Size settings.
 
 If you’re editing an inner glow effect, you see the options of Source 
(Center or Edge) and Choke, rather than Spread. The Center option 
applies the glow over the entire image except the edge, whereas the 
Edge option applies only to the element’s edge. The Choke option 
behaves similarly to the way the Spread option behaves.
 
3. If you want to use a gradient rather than a solid color, select a preset 
gradient from the Gradient drop-down panel or click the Gradient 
Editor button to edit or create your own gradient.
 
 Book IV, Chapter 2 explains the Gradient Editor in detail.
 
4. In the Technique option, select either the Softer or Precise setting.
 
 Choose Softer to apply a blurred glow. This option doesn’t preserve 
detailed edges of the element.
 
 Choose Precise to create a glow that’s good for hard-edge elements, 
such as type. This option does preserve the details.
 
5. Use the Range and Jitter options for the Contour setting.
 
 For more on contours, see the “Playing with Contours” section, later in 
this chapter.
 
6. After you refine your effect settings, click OK.
 
 Your effect is edited and ready to rock.
Editing Bevel and Emboss Effects
Because Photoshop offers five bevel and emboss styles, you have a ton of 
options. Some are similar to those found with the shadow and glow effects, 
whereas others are unique. The Layer Style dialog box is divided into four 
panels.
Structure
This panel contains the most relevant options:
 
✓ Technique: These settings of Smooth, Chisel Hard, or Chisel Soft deter-
mine how soft or hard the edge of the bevel is. Chisel Hard works well 
with type and harder-edged elements. You can see an example of each in 
Figure 4-8. I used a depth of 700% and a size of 8.

428
Editing Bevel and Emboss Effects
Smooth
Chisel Hard
Chisel Soft
Figure 4-8: Choose from three types of bevels.
 
✓ Depth: Affects how raised or sunken the edge of the bevel or pattern 
appears.
 
✓ Direction: For these settings, Up positions the highlight along the edge 
closest to the light source and the shadow on the opposite edge. Down 
does the opposite, positioning the shadow near the light source.
 
✓ Size: Controls the size of the bevel or emboss effect.
 
✓ Soften: Blurs the shading of the effect.
Shading
Because of the 3-D nature of bevel and emboss effects, Photoshop has 
settings for Highlight and Shadow (each with separate Blend Modes and 
Opacity options) and Angle. Because bevels and embosses are more dimen-
sional, an additional setting of Altitude affects the light source.
Texture
In the Texture panel (click Texture on the left side 
of the Layer Style dialog box), you can apply a 
pattern onto your layer that creates a texture, as 
shown in Figure 4-9. Adjust the scale and depth 
of the pattern, and link the pattern to the layer, if 
desired. If you link the pattern and layer, the pat-
tern moves when you move the layer. The Snap to 
Origin command aligns the pattern origin with the 
document if you select the Link with Layer option. 
If you don’t select the option, the Snap to Origin 
command aligns the pattern to the upper-left 
corner of the layer.

patterns onto your elements.

Changing Overlay Effects
Contour
Contours change the distribution of the colors in 
the effect, as shown in Figure 4-10. You can use 
the various presets offered to create interesting, 
and sometimes bizarre, shadows, glows, bevels, 
and other effects. For details on contour and its 
various iterations, see the section “Playing with 
Contours,” later in this chapter.
Editing Satin Effects
You can adjust the color, blend modes, opacity, 
angle, distance, and size — all of which I explain in the preceding sections. 
You can also adjust the contour, which is discussed in the section “Playing 
with Contours,” later in this chapter.
Changing Overlay Effects
Shadows, being based in reality, are the kinds of effects you’ll find yourself 
using frequently. On the other hand, you’ll probably use overlay effects only 
occasionally, if at all. In most cases, overlays are reserved for the realm of 
the special effect. But, in case you need to apply an overlay, here are the 
options:
 
✓ Color Overlay: Adjust the Blend Mode, Opacity, and Color settings of 
the overlay. This effect, along with the Gradient Overlay and Pattern 
Overlay, is best used with an opacity setting of less than 100% or a blend 
mode other than Normal. That way, the elements underneath aren’t 
totally obliterated.
 
✓ Gradient Overlay: Choose a preset gradient from the drop-down 
Gradient picker or click the Gradient swatch to access the Gradient 
Editor to create your own. The Align with Layer option uses the bound-
ing box of the layer to calculate the gradient. Specify the angle, style 
(Linear, Radial, Angle, Reflected, or Diamond), and scale of the gradient. 
Reverse flips the gradient. Adjust the Blend Modes and Opacity settings.
 
✓ Pattern Overlay: Select a preset pattern from the Pattern picker drop-
down panel. Snap to Origin and Link with Layer work the same as with 
Bevel and Emboss. Select Blend Modes and Opacity settings. Use the 
Scale slider to size the pattern. Figure 4-11 shows a fabric pattern over-
lay on a rose.

and an Overlay blend mode.
Changing Stroke Effects
Specify the size of your stroke in pixels and whether you want it to ride the 
outside, center, or inside of the edge of the element. Determine the Blend 
Mode and Opacity settings. Specify whether to fill your stroke with a color, 
gradient, or pattern. Select your desired color, gradient, or pattern from the 
corresponding options. These options are similar to those of overlay effects, 
described in the preceding section.
Playing with Contours
Several of the layer effects have various options for contours. Contours 
change the distribution of the colors in the effect. The default setting for all 
the effects except satin is linear contour. In an effect with a linear contour, 
the opacity drops off in a straight line.
But you’re not limited to the linear contour option. Click the arrow of the 
Contour option to make a variety of preset contours appear in a drop-down 
menu, as shown in Figure 4-12. Click the panel arrow to load the complete con-
tour preset library by selecting Contours at the bottom of the submenu. You 
can also click the Load Contours command to load other libraries you may have 
saved previously or acquired from friends, colleagues, or third-party vendors.

Playing with Contours
Figure 4-12: Choose from a wide assortment of preset contours for your layer styles.
The presets offer contours such as Ring, Rolling, Sawtooth, and Steps, all 
of which create rings of transparency within the shadows and glows. If you 
use contours with bevel and emboss effects, you can create nooks, crannies, 
bumps, and lumps that are highlighted and shaded.
In the Contour panel pop-up menu, you can also find options for naming 
and deleting contours, as well as saving, loading, resetting, and replacing 
contour libraries. Using different contours can create fun and funky shadows 
and glow, as shown in Figure 4-13.

Adjusting contour settings
You’re using Photoshop, the Swiss Army knife of the graphics-editing world, 
so you can do a whole lot more than select a preset contour and apply it to 
a layer. Depending on the effect you’re working with, you can change the 
appearance of the contour in a variety of ways:
 
✓ Noise: Randomizes the colors of selected pixels in the drop or inner 
shadows to give a gritty effect.
 
✓ Anti-Aliasing: Slightly softens the edge pixels of a contour.
 
✓ Range: Controls how much of the glow is targeted for the contour. 
Reduce the Range setting to get a less feathered, tighter, and larger 
glow.
 
✓ Jitter: Doesn’t affect the appearance of the default glow, but with other 
gradients, the Jitter setting varies the color and opacity of selected 
pixels to give a roughened effect.
 
✓ Invert: Turns the colors of the satin effect inside out.
 
✓ Gloss Contour: Changes the distribution of color in the effect over the 
layer. It creates a metallic effect when used with the Bevel and Emboss 
styles. The Contour option that appears indented below the Bevel and 
Emboss style in the Styles list, does the same for the edges of the layer. 
It creates shaded and highlighted nooks and crannies when used with 
the Bevel and Emboss styles.

Applying and Modifying Preset Styles
Modifying contours with the Contour Editor
If the preset contours just don’t do it for you, feel free to create your own by 
following these steps:
 
1. Open the Contour Editor dialog 
box, shown in Figure 4-14, by 
clicking the Contour thumbnail in 
the Layer Style dialog box.
 
2. Click the line on the Mapping grid 
to add points and drag the line to 
adjust the slope.
 
 You can also select a point on the 
Mapping line and enter values in 
the Input and Output boxes.
 
3. To create a sharp corner, rather 
than a curve, select a point and 
click the Corner option.
 
4. When you have the contour to 
your liking, click the New button, 
give it a name in the Contour 
Name dialog box that appears, 
as shown in Figure 4-15, and 
click OK.
 
 Photoshop saves your custom con-
tour as a preset and makes it avail-
able in the Contour panel.
 
You can save custom contours for reloading later or for trading with friends 
and neighbors. (Try giving them away on Halloween.) Photoshop saves a 
contour as a .shc file in the Contours folder in the Presets folder in the 
Photoshop application folder.
Applying and Modifying Preset Styles
In addition to layer effects, Photoshop also offers you a multitude of preset 
layer styles that you can access via the Styles panel, in the Window menu, 
shown in Figure 4-16.
You can also access these styles by using the Style picker drop-down panel 
on the Options bar, when the Pen or shape tools are active and you have the 
Shape Layer option selected. And you can find the Styles panel nestled at the 
top of the Layer Style dialog box, as well.

Here are the many splendid ways to apply a preset style:
 
✓ Select the layer and click a style in the Styles panel.
 
✓ Drag and drop a style from the Styles panel onto a layer in the Layers 
panel.
 
✓ Drag and drop a style directly onto the image window. When your 
cursor is over the element to which you want to apply the style, release 
your mouse button.
 
✓ Double-click the layer thumbnail in the Layers panel. Select Styles in 
the upper-left side of the Layer Style dialog box. Choose a style from the 
panel. Click OK to close the Layer Style dialog box.

Applying and Modifying Preset Styles
 
✓ If you’re using a Pen or shape tool, select the Shape Layer option. Then, 
select a style from the Style picker drop-down panel on the Options bar 
before drawing the shape.
 
By default, applying a style over another style replaces it. To add a style 
along with another, hold down the Shift key while clicking or dragging the 
style.
Managing preset styles
Here are some additional points to remember when using the Styles panel. 
You can do any of the following:
 
✓ Load another Style preset library. In the Styles panel, the Style picker 
drop-down panel in the Options bar, or the Styles panel in the Layer 
Style dialog box, you can select Load Styles from the panel pop-up menu 
to add a library to your current preset list (refer to Figure 4-16). Select 
the library and click Load. You can also select Replace Styles. Even 
easier, just select a preset library from the bottom of the menu and click 
OK to replace or append your current list.
 
✓ Use the Preset Manager to load preset style libraries. You can also 
rename, delete, and save whole libraries of presets. See Book I, Chapter 5.
 
✓ Return to the default library of presets. Select Reset Styles from the 
Styles panel pop-up menu.
 
✓ From the Styles panel pop-up menu, select a viewing option for your 
panel. You can select Small or Large Thumbnail or Small or Large List. 
And, of course, there’s also Text Only, but what fun is it if you can’t see 
the presets?
 
✓ Rename a preset style. Although there are a lot of ways to rename a 
preset style, it’s easiest to double-click the style in the Styles panel. If 
you’re in Thumbnail view, type a new name in the dialog box and click 
OK. If the view is set to Small List or Large List, simply type a new name 
directly in the Styles panel and press Enter (Return on the Mac).
 
✓ Save a set of preset styles as a library. Select Save Styles from the 
Styles panel pop-up menu, from the Styles panel of the Layer Style dialog 
box pop-up menu, or from the Style picker drop-down panel pop-up 
menu on the Options bar. Name the library, navigate to the Styles folder 
in the Presets folder in the Photoshop folder, and click Save.
 
✓ Delete a preset style. Drag the style to the trash can icon in the Styles 
panel or Alt-click (Option-click on the Mac) the style. You can also select 
Delete Style from the Styles panel of the Layer Style dialog box or the 
Style picker drop-down panel on the Options bar.

436
Applying and Modifying Preset Styles
 
✓ Clear a style (that is, remove it from the layer). Select your desired 
layer in the Layers panel and click the Clear Style button in the Styles 
panel. You can also click the Default Style (None) swatch in the stand-
alone Styles panel or the ones located in the Layer Style dialog box or on 
the Options bar.
 
✓ Change the style or color of the currently active shape layer. Click the 
link icon on the Options bar and select a different style or color. This 
option allows you to experiment with different styles for that shape.
 
 Conversely, if you deselect the link icon, Photoshop doesn’t change the 
style of the active shape layer when you select a different style. This 
option allows you to select a different style or color for a new shape 
layer without affecting the previous shape layer.
Saving your own style
If you get bored using the preset style libraries, or if you really went to town 
and created a custom style that you think is so fabulous that you’ll want to 
use it again and again, you can easily save it to the Styles panel. Just follow 
these steps to save a custom style:
 
1. Create your own custom style by applying layer effects and/or styles 
to your layer.
 
 Starting with an existing preset style and modifying the settings to suit 
your needs is also easy.
 
2. After you complete your style, click the Create New Style button in the 
Styles panel or select New Style from the Styles panel pop-up menu.
 
 You can also simply click in an empty space in the Styles panel. Or you 
can double-click the fx icon or effect name to open the Layer Style dialog 
box, in which you can click the New Style button.
 
3. In the New Style dialog box, shown in Figure 4-17, name your style 
and select your desired options.
 
 The Include Layer Effects check box includes any effects you applied 
via the Effects section of the Layer Style dialog box — drop shadows, 
bevels, and so on.
 
 The Include Layer Blending Options check box includes any blending 
you did by using the Blending Options section of the Layer Styles panel. 
Photoshop adds your new style to the end of the Styles panel. If you 
want to edit your custom style, you must select each individual effect in 
the Layers panel and adjust the settings in the Layer Styles dialog box.
 
In the Styles panel, Alt-click (Option-click on the Mac) to create a new style 
and bypass the dialog box. Your style gets the default name of Style 1.

Clipping Layers into Masks
Figure 4-17: Create a custom style and save it in your Styles panel.
Clipping Layers into Masks
In a clipping mask, the bottommost layer (also known as the base layer) acts 
as a mask for the layers above it. The layers in the group clip to the opaque 
areas of the base layer and don’t show over the transparent areas of the 
base layer.
At this point, you might be saying, “Huh?” Instead of trying to decipher the 
definition, a better way to understand a clipping mask is to just create one. 
Follow the steps in this section, and I know that rather than “Huh,” you’ll be 
saying “Yeah, baby,” just like Austin Powers.
Creating a clipping mask works well if you want to fill type with different 
images on multiple layers.

438
Clipping Layers into Masks
Using the steps that follow, I created a new document with a white back-
ground. I took the Custom Shape tool, selected the Fill Region option (see 
Book IV, Chapter 1 for more on shapes), and drew a heart on my second 
layer. I added a drop shadow and inner bevel to my heart for added dimen-
sion, but this step isn’t mandatory.
I then opened an image of an island and dragged and dropped that image 
onto my composite. I opened an image of some dolphins, selected a couple 
of dolphins, and dragged and dropped them onto my composite.
And, finally, I created some type and applied a drop shadow and inner bevel 
to the type, as shown in Figure 4-18.

Follow these steps to create your own clipping mask:
 
1. Open or create an image that has several layers.
 
2. Hold down Alt (Option on the Mac) and position your mouse cursor 
over the line dividing two layers in the Layers panel.
 
 Your cursor changes to two overlapping circles with a small arrow icon. 
You can also choose Layer➪Create Clipping Mask.
 
3. Click your mouse button.
 
 I did this three times: in between my type and the dolphin layer, in 
between the dolphin and the island layer, and in between the island 
layer and my heart shape. Notice how all my images and my type clip to 
the base layer (the heart shape) in the Layers panel (refer to 
Figure 4-18).
 
 Nothing outside the boundaries of the heart shape is visible on any 
of the layers in the clipping mask, as shown in Figure 4-18. The down-
pointing arrow icons beside each layer on the Layers panel indicate that 
the layers are clipped. The clipping mask takes on the opacity and blend 
mode of the base layer.
Managing clipping masks
Here’s some clipping mask trivia:
 ✓ To remove a single layer from the clipping 
mask, you can simply Alt-click (Option-click 
on the Mac) the line between the two layers 
in the Layers panel. Or you can select the 
layer and choose Layer➪Release Clipping 
Mask. Both commands remove the selected 
layer and any layers above it from the clip-
ping mask.
 ✓ To ungroup all the layers in the clipping 
mask, select the clipped layer and choose 
Layer➪Release Clipping Mask.
 ✓ You can also apply clipping masks to adjust-
ment and fill layers. If you clip between a 
regular layer and an adjustment layer, or a 
regular layer and a fill layer, the adjustment 
or fill layer affects only the pixels of the 
adjacent underlying layer, rather than all 
the underlying layers. For more on adjust-
ment and fill layers, see Book V, Chapter 1.

Putting It Together
Adding Text and Layer Styles to a Collage
If you’ve been reading Book V from the beginning, then you may have a nearly complete 
collage on your hands. If you’re at all interested in using words with your images, then 
now (at the end of the project, not the beginning) is the time to add them. Adding type can 
turn a good composite into a dynamite and cohesive image that conveys exactly what 
you want. I’m no Shakespeare and can’t help you create the perfect tag line, but I can 
show you how to add text to your collage. Adding layer styles gives you versatility in the 
kinds of effects you can apply to layers, so I show you how to apply those to a collage. To 
add and adjust type, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the saved collage ﬁ le.
 
 Make sure that the Layers panel is open.
 
2. Select the Eyedropper tool from the Tools panel. Click a color in the collage that 
you like.
 
 The color you sampled is now the foreground color.
 
3. Select the Type tool. On the Options bar, select a font, style, point size, and other 
formatting options.
 
 I recommend choosing an easy-to-read serif font and applying a bold style to it. I’m 
using Times Bold, and I set the point size to 100.
 
 I set the Anti-Aliasing option to Crisp and the Alignment option to Left, but you can 
explore your options until you’re dizzy (or your deadline passes).
 
4. Click inside your image and type some text.
 
 I typed Go outside for my travel collage.
 
5. Select the Move tool from the Tools panel and position the type in the collage.
 
 I put my text in the upper-left corner.
 
6. Adjust your settings as you desire.
 
 If you want to add a second, smaller line of text, grab the Type tool again, click the 
image, and reduce the point size from the Options bar. You can change other set-
tings, as well.
 
7. When you’re satisﬁ ed with your changes, click under the ﬁ rst line of text and type 
your next line.
 
 Under Go outside, I typed and play, as shown in the ﬁ gure.
 
 With the Move tool, ﬁ ne-tune the position of the type.

When you’re satisﬁ ed with the size, style, color, and appearance of the type in your 
collage, you can make some more large-scale changes by creating layer styles. Follow 
these steps:
 
1. Add a drop shadow.
 
 Make sure that you select Use Global Light so that all the layers use the same 
angle.
 
 In the Layers panel, select the layer that includes the ﬁ rst line of text. Then, 
choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Drop Shadow. Make sure the Drop Shadow box is 
selected in the left column.
 
 You can change the angle so that the light source is coming from one direction or 
another (mine’s set at 120% so that the light’s coming from the upper-left).
 
2. Add bevels and embossing.
 
 Click the Bevel and Emboss style in the left column.
 
 Make sure that you actually select the style and not just the box; otherwise, the 
right panel with all the options doesn’t appear.
 
 In my example, I selected Inner Bevel from the Style pop-up menu in the right 
panel. Then, I selected Chisel Soft from the Technique pop-up menu. My idea was 
to give the type a carved-in-stone look.
 
3. Click OK when you’re satisﬁ ed with the styles you’ve created in the layer so far.

4. Apply the same styles to the layer that includes the second line of text, as shown 
in the ﬁ gure.
 
 To get the exact same settings without having to make every adjustment again, 
right-click (Control-click on the Mac) the fx icon on the ﬁ rst layer you worked 
on and select Copy Layer Style from the context menu that appears. Select the 
second type layer and right-click (Control-click on the Mac) on the layer name, 
then select Paste Layer Style from the context menu that appears.
 
5. Make any last adjustments and choose File➪Save.
 
 You’re all done. If you feel like it, keep adding to or reﬁ ning the collage when you 
ﬁ gure out new tricks.

Chapter 5: Working 
with Smart Objects
In This Chapter
✓ Creating Smart Objects
✓ Converting Smart Objects
✓ Editing Smart Objects
W
ith the advent of Smart Objects, Photoshop has significantly cut 
your editing time while letting you transform your objects indefi-
nitely without fear of quality loss. That’s right. Vector files, raster files — it 
doesn’t matter to these intelligent fellows. And with Smart Objects, you 
create the art once, and then if you want to show the art again, you use 
what are called instances. These instances can be linked to your original art, 
which makes editing a breeze. This chapter tells you all about 
this feature — the ultimate in digital recycling.
Introducing Smart Objects
A Smart Object is actually what Adobe refers to as 
a container, in which a bitmap (raster) or vector 
image’s source data is embedded. So, in essence, a 
Smart Object is composed of two files, one inside 
the other. Adobe uses the analogy of a new file, the 
child, which is embedded into the original file, the 
parent. This source data of the child is contained in 
the Smart Object parent but keeps all its native char-
acteristics and is fully editable.
Here are a few advantages of Smart Objects:
 
✓ Transform with minimum degradation. In Book III, Chapter 3, I warn 
you about the negative side of transformations. When transforming 
traditional layers, your image goes through the process of resampling, 
which then causes degradation of quality. With Smart Objects, you can 
perform multiple transformations on your artwork without losing any 
additional image quality. Photoshop does this by actually using your 
original source data to render the additional transformations.

444
Creating Smart Objects
 
✓ Preserve non-native file data. Photoshop transforms any non-native 
image information, such as Illustrator vector artwork, into a format it 
can recognize without altering the native data.
 
✓ Edit the Smart Object, and all instances are dynamically updated. If you 
make changes to the original Smart Object, all instances (duplicates of the 
original) are automatically changed, as well. No need to change them indi-
vidually. This can be a real timesaver, especially if you’ve gone crazy with 
the number of instances you’ve used, such as on a map or Web home page.
 
✓ Apply a Smart Filter. Layers must first be converted to Smart Objects 
before you can apply a Smart Filter. Smart Filters are a totally non-
destructive way to apply filters which can then be edited indefinitely. 
For details on this great feature, see Book VII, Chapter 1.
Creating Smart Objects
You can create a Smart Object in a few ways. You can import the artwork 
via the Place command. You can also copy and paste the artwork from 
Illustrator into Photoshop. Or you can convert a Photoshop layer into a 
Smart Object. Finally, you can create one Smart Object from another. I dis-
cuss the specific steps for each way in the following sections.
Placing artwork
You may not have much experience in using the Place command in 
Photoshop because most activities involve opening images and creating new 
ones. But with the advent of Smart Objects, you may call on this command 
more frequently. Follow these steps to place artwork:
Figure 5-1: Create a Smart Object by placing your artwork into a 
Photoshop file.

445
Book V
Chapter 5
Working with 
Smart Objects
Creating Smart Objects
 
1. Choose File➪New and create a new blank Photoshop document, using 
your desired size and settings.
 
 If you’re unsure about creating a new file, see Book I, Chapter 3. You can 
also use an existing Photoshop file.
 
2. Choose File➪Place. In the Place dialog box, locate and select your 
desired artwork. Click the Place button.
 
 If your file is in any format besides Illustrator or PDF, it pops right 
onto your canvas, as shown in Figure 5-1. Note the bounding box and X 
around and across the image, which is an indication that the image has 
been placed.
 
 If your file is a native Illustrator or 
PDF file, the Open as Smart Object 
dialog box appears, asking you for 
additional information, as shown 
in Figure 5-2. If it’s a multipaged 
PDF, you can select the page or 
image you want placed. Select your 
cropping options. Not sure what 
they mean? Just select one and 
view the thumbnail to see how the 
image appears in relationship to 
the page. By the way, you can also 
select between a Small, Large, and 
Fit Page thumbnail view.
 
 If you happen to deselect the 
Create PDF Compatible File option when saving your native Illustrator 
file, you see a nasty warning in the Place PDF dialog box telling you to 
go back and resave your file with the option checked and then place the 
file again. Don’t take it personally. Illustrator was programmed based 
on PDF core code and sometimes doesn’t like it when you strip it of the 
connection.
 
 You can also select the image in 
Adobe Bridge and choose File➪
Place➪In Photoshop. See Book I, 
Chapter 4 for details on working 
with Bridge.
 
3. Using the bounding box, trans-
form (scale, rotate, and so on) 
your image to your desired 
dimensions and then position 
it on your canvas, as shown in 
Figure 5-3.
Figure 5-2: When placing an Illustrator or 
PDF file, specify your options in the Open As 
Smart Object dialog box.
Figure 5-3: Transform and position your 
image before committing it into your file.

446
Creating Smart Objects
 
 Remember, you can rest assured that your transformations are applied 
without degrading the quality of your image.
 
 Note that if your image is larger than the Photoshop canvas, it’s 
automatically sized to fit within the canvas dimensions. If you need a 
refresher on transforming and moving, see Book III, Chapter 3.
 
 If you’re placing a PDF, EPS (most of them), or native Illustrator file, 
specify the Anti-Alias option on the 
Options bar. Check it to create a 
softer, blended edge. Uncheck it to 
produce a hard edge.
 
4. After you have your image the way 
you want it, either double-click 
inside the bounding box, press Enter 
(Return on the Mac), or click the 
Commit (check mark icon) button on 
the Options bar.
 
 When the artwork is committed, the 
native file data is embedded into the 
Photoshop file, and the artwork is 
rasterized on its own layer. The Smart 
Object icon appears on those layers, 
as shown in Figure 5-4.
 
 If you change your mind and don’t want to commit the image, press Esc 
or click the Cancel button on the Options bar.
Copying and pasting
Before you copy and paste artwork from Illustrator into Photoshop as a 
Smart Object, be sure to check the PDF and AICB (No Transparency Support) 
options in the File Handling and Clipboard preferences in Illustrator. Leave 
the default of Preserve Appearances and Overprints checked. By doing 
so, you can control how your artwork is rasterized in Photoshop. If left 
unchecked, Photoshop rasterizes the art without your vital input. Follow 
these steps to copy and paste artwork as a Smart Object from Illustrator into 
Photoshop:
 
1. Open your desired Adobe Illustrator file in Illustrator.
 
2. Select your artwork and choose Edit➪Copy.
 
3. Switch to Photoshop. Open your desired Photoshop document or 
create a new document.
 
4. Choose Edit➪Paste.
 
5. In the Paste dialog box, shown in Figure 5-5, select the Smart Object 
option and click OK.

Chapter 5
Working with 
Smart Objects
Creating Smart Objects
 
 Your image is imported and appears in a 
bounding box, and the Layers panel shows 
that you pasted the image as a Smart Object, 
as shown in Figure 5-5.
 
6. Using the bounding box, transform (scale, 
rotate, and so on) your image to your desired 
dimensions and position it on your canvas.
 
 Perspective, Distort, and Warp transforma-
tions are unavailable to Smart Objects.
 
 Because you chose Smart Object in the Paste 
dialog box in Step 4, remember that you can 
transform your artwork without degrading it 
before you place it into Photoshop. Like with 
the Place command, the native file data is embedded into the Photoshop 
file, and the art is rasterized on its own layer after the artwork is com-
mitted.
 
7. Commit the artwork by either double-clicking inside the bound-
ing box, pressing Enter (Return on the Mac), or clicking the Commit 
(check mark icon) button on the Options bar.
Converting a layer into a Smart Object 
and vice versa
If you want to convert a layer into a Smart Object, follow these steps:
 
1. Select your desired layer in the Layers panel.
 
2. Choose Layer➪Smart Objects➪Convert to Smart Object.
 
 You can also select the command from the Layers panel pop-up menu. 
After you convert a layer into a Smart Object, you see the Smart Object 
icon in the lower-right corner of the layer thumbnail.
You can also convert a Smart Object into a layer. You may want to do this if 
you need to paint on your artwork. Follow these steps to make the conversion:
 
1. Select your desired layer in the Layers panel.
 
2. Choose Layer➪Rasterize➪Smart Object.
 
 Note that your Smart Object is rasterized at its current size, so be sure it’s 
the size you want before you execute the command. Your Smart Object 
icon disappears, and you’re left with a normal, run-of-the mill layer.
Creating one Smart Object from another
Sometimes, you may want to use one Smart Object as the basis for another. 
Depending on your needs, you can keep the new Smart Object linked or 
Figure 5-5: When copying 
and pasting artwork from 
Illustrator to Photoshop, 
specify how you want the 
artwork pasted.

Editing Smart Objects
unlinked to the original. If it remains linked, modifying the original automati-
cally modifies the duplicate. If unlinked, you can modify the original without 
changing the duplicate. In addition, you’re free to change the duplicate 
without worrying about affecting the original. Follow these steps to create a 
Smart Object from another:
 
1. Select the Smart Object layer in the Layers panel.
 
2. Create a duplicate Smart Object that’s linked or unlinked to the original:
 
• An unlinked object: Choose Layer➪Smart Objects➪New Smart 
Object via Copy.
 
• A linked object: Choose Layer➪New➪Layer via Copy.
 
 A new Smart Object layer appears in the Layers panel, as shown in 
Figure 5-6.
 
You can also drag and release the Smart Object layer over the Create a New 
Layer icon at the bottom of the Layers panel. This action creates a duplicate 
Smart Object that’s linked.

Editing Smart Objects
Editing Smart Objects
One of the great things about Smart Objects is that you can edit the contents, 
or source data. If the source content is a vector-based PDF, AI, or EPS file and 
was prepared in Illustrator, it opens in that program. If the source content 
is raster-based and created in Photoshop, the file opens in Photoshop. (For 
details on vector versus raster images, see Book II, Chapter 1.)
Follow these steps to edit the contents of a Smart Object:
 
1. In your document, select the Smart Object layer in the Layers panel.
 
2. Choose Layer➪Smart Objects➪Edit Contents.
 
 Or you can simply double-click the Smart Objects layer thumbnail in the 
Layers panel.
 
 A dialog box appears telling you to save your changes and to save the 
file in the same location.
 
3. Click OK to close the dialog box.
 
 The Smart Object opens in the 
program in which it was created, 
either Illustrator or Photoshop.
 
4. Edit your file ad nauseum.
 
5. Choose File➪Save to incorporate 
the edits.
 
6. Close your source file.
 
7. Return to your Photoshop docu-
ment, which contains your Smart 
Object.
 
 If all goes as expected, all instances 
of the Smart Object are updated. 
For example, my butterflies went 
from purple in Figure 5-6 to blue in 
Figure 5-7.
Replacing contents
When replacing the contents of a Smart Object with new contents, you auto-
matically update all instances of that Smart Object in your document, which 
can be a real productivity enhancer. Just follow these short steps:
 
1. Select the Smart Object layer in the Layers panel.
 
2. Choose Layer➪Smart Objects➪Replace Contents.
 
3. In the Place dialog box, locate your new file and click the Place button.
Figure 5-7: The Photoshop document 
automatically reflects any editing you do to 
your Smart Object.

Editing Smart Objects
 
4. Click OK if presented with a 
dialog box, and the new contents 
pop into place, replacing the old 
contents, as shown in Figure 5-8.
 
 All instances of that Smart Object 
are also updated in your document.
 
 To replace the contents of a single 
instance of a Smart Object, you 
have to make sure that the Smart 
Object isn’t linked to other Smart 
Objects. To create an unlinked 
Smart Object, select the Smart 
Object instance you want to 
change, choose Layer➪Smart 
Objects➪New Smart Object via 
Copy. Make your desired replace-
ment and then delete the original 
Smart Object.
Exporting contents
You can export your Smart Object and save it to a hard drive or external 
media. Photoshop exports the contents of your Smart Object in its original 
placed format, such as JPEG, native Illustrator (.ai), TIFF, PDF, and so on. 
Follow these steps:
 
1. Select the Smart Object in the Layers panel.
 
2. Choose Layer➪Smart Objects➪Export Contents.
 
3. In the Save dialog box, navigate to your destination and click Save.
 
 Note that if your Smart Object was created from layers, it exports in the 
PSB format. Remember, you can open the .psb file only in Photoshop. It 
won’t open in another program.
 
The last command in the Layer➪Smart Objects submenu is Stack Mode. 
Unfortunately, this command is available only in the Extended version. 
People in the science, forensics, medical, and pro video fields are probably 
thrilled over its capabilities. How about the rest of us? Well, using image 
stacks can help to decrease the noise in your images across multiple expo-
sures. In this case, noise can be defined not just as the grainy or wavy little 
artifacts throughout your image, but also anything that you don’t want in the 
picture — cars, birds, annoying people walking in front of your scenic shot. 
If this sounds like something worthwhile for your workflow, it may be worth 
checking out an upgrade.

blue butterflies with that of a rarer species.

Book VI
Channels and 
Masks

I
f you got the basics down and are ready for 
something a little more challenging, this is 
your book. Here I help you start working with 
channels and creating masks. Creating masks is 
one of the most accurate ways to make a selection 
and is especially useful in tackling more difficult 
selections. 
In this book, I show you different ways of creating 
a mask, from quick masks to layer masks to chan-
nel masks. If you’ve ever flung your mouse or sty-
lus pen in frustration because you couldn’t select 
the hair on your loved one’s photo, you’ll be well-
served by reading this book and getting up to 
speed on masking techniques.

Chapter 1: Using Channels
In This Chapter
✓ Understanding what a channel is
✓ Working with the Channels panel
✓ Editing channels
✓ Creating alpha channels
✓ Using the Channel Mixer
I
f you’re reading this, it probably means that you didn’t quickly thumb 
through this chapter, say “Yuck, boorrrrringgg!” and move on to sexier 
topics such as blending, filtering, and retouching. You knew that would be a 
huge mistake.
The wonderful thing about channels is that they offer you 
greater control and selectivity when doing those very 
things — blending, filtering, and retouching. Channels 
give you one more level of control when editing your 
images. You can use individual channels for layer- 
blending options and filters, as well as starting 
points for masks.
Channels also come into play when saving selec-
tions for later use or for adding spot (custom) 
colors to your image. You can also use channels 
to turn color images into nicely contrasted gray-
scale images. And finally, you can play around with 
the colors in an image by mixing up the channels. 
So bear with me. The topic of channels may be a bit 
dry and technical, but in the end, channels enable you to 
hold the envious title of Master Editor.
To understand how channels work, you’ll find it helpful to know a few 
things about colors — specifically, the various color modes, which I cover 
in Book II, Chapter 2.

Understanding Channels

Understanding Channels
When you look at a color image, you see one big, 24-bit, composite collection 
of colored pixels. Technically speaking, however, Photoshop doesn’t see 
that at all. Photoshop perceives a color image as individual bands of 8-bit, 
grayscale images. RGB images have three bands; CMYK images have four 
bands.
 
I know it’s strange to think of a color image as being composed of several 
grayscale images, but it’s true. Each one of these bands, or grayscale images, 
is a channel. Specifically, they’re color channels. If you just can’t get past the 
fact that a color image is the sum of several grayscale channels, as shown in 
Figure 1-1, then just think of channels as holding tanks for color data.
Corbis Digital Stock
Figure 1-1: A color image is composed of 8-bit grayscale images referred to as channels.
Another way of relating channels to the real world is in terms of hardware. 
Here’s how the most common hardware handles color:
 
✓ When you offset print a CMYK image, the process separates the colors 
(see Book IX, Chapter 1) into four colors — cyan, magenta, yellow, and 
black. Paper passes through four individual rollers on the printing press, 
and each roller contains one of those four colored inks.
 
✓ Scanners scan in RGB via a pass of red, green, and blue sensors over 
your image.
 
✓ Digital cameras capture images in RGB.
 
✓ CRT screens display images via red, green, and blue tubes.

Understanding Channels

Book VI
Chapter 1
Using Channels
In addition to color channels, there are channels called alpha channels 
(covered in the section “Introducing Alpha Channels,” later in this chapter) 
and others called spot channels (discussed in Book IX, Chapter 1). Photoshop 
now supports up to 56 channels per file. So knock yourself out! Just remember 
that each channel you add increases your file size.
Briefly, you can use alpha channels to create, store, and edit selections, 
defining them not by a selection outline, but by black, white, and varying 
shades of gray pixels — in other words, a grayscale image. Black pixels 
represent unselected areas of the image, white pixels represent selected 
areas, and gray pixels represent partially selected pixels.
You can create spot channels when you want to add a spot (or custom) 
color to your image. Spot colors are premixed inks often used in addition to 
or in lieu of CMYK colors.
All images, no matter what their color mode, have at least one channel. 
Grayscale, Bitmap, Duotone, and Indexed Color (for GIF Web images) modes 
have only one channel. RGB and CMYK images have three and four channels, 
respectively. They also contain a composite channel, which reflects the com-
bination of the individual color channels and gives you the full color display.
A little bit about bit depth
When you’re standing around the water cooler 
or the color printer, and hear people talking 
about a 1-bit or an 8-bit image, they’re refer-
ring to something called bit depth. Bit depth 
measures how much color information is avail-
able to display and print each pixel. A higher 
bit depth means the image can display more 
information — specifically, more colors. For 
example, a 1-bit image can display two color 
values — black and white. That’s why a purely 
black-and-white image is called a bitmap 
image. Likewise
 ✓ An 8-bit image can contain up to 256 gray-
scale levels (28). Grayscale images are 8 bit 
(1 channel, 8 bits).
 ✓ A 24-bit image can contain about 16 mil-
lion colors (224). RGB images are 24 bit 
(3 channels × 8 bits).
 ✓ CMYK images are 32 bit (4 channels × 8 
bits). CMYK images, however, are limited 
to the number of colors that are physically 
reproducible on paper, which is around 
55,000.
 ✓ High Dynamic Range (HDR) images are 96 bit 
(3 channels [RGB] × 32 bits). Theoretically, 
they’re capable of having about 65 million 
colors, but in reality, the maximum range is 
determined by what colors were captured 
by the camera.
Bit depths typically range from 1 to 64 bits.

Working with Channels
Like with layers (which I discuss in Book V), channels have their own panel 
that acts as command central for viewing, creating, and managing tasks. 
The first step is accessing channels by choosing 
Window➪Channels. The Channels panel appears, 
as shown in Figure 1-2.
Viewing channels without 
a remote
Selecting a channel in the Channels panel auto-
matically makes it appear in the image window. To 
select a channel, click the channel thumbnail or 
name in the panel. To select more than one chan-
nel, Shift-click. To show or hide a channel, click 
in the eye column in the far left of the panel. You 
can also drag through the column to hide or show 
the channels quickly.
CMYK, RGB, and Lab images have a composite channel, in addition to their 
individual channels. This composite channel is the combination of all the 
channels in the image and is named after the color mode. For example, the 
composite channel in Figure 1-2 is the first one, called CMYK.
Changing the default channel view
The default setting is to view your channels in grayscale. You can, 
however, view them in color. To do so, choose Edit➪Preferences➪Interface 
(Photoshop➪Preferences➪Interface on the Mac) and select Show Channels 
in Color.
Although this option graphically exemplifies the way an image comprises 
separate color channels, it really does you no good if you want to work with 
your channels for editing. That’s because the color view obscures details 
and makes measuring the impact of adjustments and filters more difficult. 
You need to see the channels in their true grayscale form for that.
 
If you select or show more than one channel, even in the default grayscale 
view, the channels always appear in color.
To change the size of the thumbnail that appears, select Panel Options 
from the Channels panel pop-up menu. Select your desired thumbnail 
size. If you’re working with several channels and you have a dinosaur of a 
computer, you can also choose None to turn off the thumbnails — which 
improves performance.
Figure 1-2: The Channels 
panel stores all the image’s 
channels, from spot to alpha 
channels.

Using Channels
Duplicating and deleting channels
Duplicating channels is something you may do quite often. I know I do. And 
deleting channels isn’t just for neat freaks: Channels take up a lot of memory, 
so getting rid of the ones you no longer need is always good.
Here are some instances when duplicating channels is a good idea:
 
✓ When you want to create a channel mask: First, you find a suitable 
channel and then make a duplicate. (For more on this technique, see 
Book VI, Chapter 3.) You can use channel masks to select difficult ele-
ments involving fine details, such as hair, fur, smoke, and so on.
 
✓ When you want to make a backup copy of the channel before doing 
some editing: Having a backup, just to be on the safe side, is always a 
good idea. For example, you may want to apply an Unsharp Mask filter 
to one or two channels to improve the focus of the image. For more on 
the Unsharp Mask filter, see Book VII, Chapter 1.
 
✓ To insert a copy of an alpha channel into another image: For example, 
maybe you spent an hour creating elaborate alpha channels for shadows 
and highlights on a product photographed in flat lighting.
 
 You may have 12 products, all the same shape but different colors, that 
you need to apply those highlights and shadows to. Instead of re-creating 
the wheel each time, you could simply duplicate the alpha channels into 
each file.
Duplicating channels
To duplicate a channel, follow these short steps:
 
1. Select your desired channel in the Channels panel.
 
2. Select Duplicate Channel from the 
panel pop-up menu.
 
 The Duplicate Channel dialog box 
appears, as shown in Figure 1-3.
 
3. In the Duplicate section, name the 
channel.
 
 You can also drag the channel to 
the New Channel icon at the bottom 
of the panel. If you do this, Photoshop provides a default name and 
bypasses Steps 3 through 6.
 
 You can also duplicate a channel to another image by dragging the chan-
nel. Open your destination image and drag the desired channel from 
your current image into the destination image window. The duplicated 
channel appears in the Channels panel.
Figure 1-3: Name and provide a destination 
for your duplicate channel.

Working with Channels
458
 
4. In the Destination section, select a file from the Document 
drop-down list.
 
 Or choose New to create a new image.
 
 You can choose your current image or any 
open image with the same pixel dimensions as 
your current image. (For more on pixel dimen-
sions, see Book II, Chapter 1.)
 
 If you choose New, Photoshop creates a new 
image that has a single channel. Provide a 
name for the file.
 
5. Select Invert if you want to reverse the 
selected and unselected areas of the 
duplicate channel.
 
 You use the Invert option primarily when 
you duplicate an existing alpha channel. For 
more on alpha channels, see the section 
“Introducing Alpha Channels,” later in this 
chapter.
 
6. Click OK.
 
 The dialog box closes. Your duplicate channel appears in the Channels 
panel, as shown in Figure 1-4.
Replacing one channel over another
To replace the contents of one channel into another, you can use the copy-
and-paste method. In your current image, select your desired channel in the 
Channels panel. Choose Select➪All and then Edit➪Copy. Select the channel 
in the destination image that you want to replace and choose Edit➪Paste. 
The pasted content of the channel replaces the original content.
Deleting unwanted channels
To delete an unwanted channel — something you definitely want to do 
because channels can eat up a lot of space — select the channel in the 
Channels panel and do one of the following:
 
✓ Drag the channel to the trash-can icon at the bottom of the panel.
 
✓ Select Delete Channel from the panel pop-up menu.
 
✓ Click the trash-can icon and then click Yes in the dialog box.
 
✓ Alt-click (Option-click on the Mac) the trash-can icon.

channels for masking, as well 
as for backup purposes.

Using Channels
Rearranging and renaming channels
Although you can’t shuffle or rename color channels, you can do so with 
spot and alpha channels. To move a spot or alpha channel, simply drag it 
up or down in the Channels panel. When you see a dark line appear where 
you want the channel to go, release your mouse button. You can move a 
spot or alpha channel above a color channel only in a multichannel image. In 
short, in a multichannel image, each channel becomes an independent spot 
channel, and the channels no longer have a relationship with each other. 
Multichannel images don’t support layers. For more details, see Book II, 
Chapter 2.
To rename a spot or alpha channel, double-click the name in the Channel 
panel and type a new name. You can also select Channel Options from the 
panel pop-up menu.
Splitting channels
You can split the channels of your image into separate images in separate 
files. For example, in Figure 1-5, you see the Red, Green, Blue, Alpha, and 
Spot channels split into individual channels. Choose Split Channels from the 
panel pop-up menu. When you do so, your original image closes. The chan-
nel files have the name of your original image plus the channel name. You 
can split channels only on a flattened image — in other words, an image that 
has no individual layers.
Corbis Digital Stock
Figure 1-5: Be sure to save all changes in your original image before you split it because 
Photoshop closes your file.

Working with Channels
460
You might want to split channels if you need to save your original file in a 
format that doesn’t preserve channels — such as EPS, which doesn’t support 
alpha channels. Or you may want to split channels to merge them later on.
Merging channels
You can merge channels into a single image. The channels must be opened as 
separate images, in grayscale mode, and have the same pixel dimensions. You 
can merge channels only when they’re flattened images and have no layers.
Merging color channels can create some unique special effects. For exam-
ple, by mismatching your channels when you merge them, you can create 
bizarre, and sometimes beautiful, color shifts.
To merge channels, follow these steps:
 
1. Open your split channel files and activate any one of them.
 
2. Choose Merge Channels from the Channels panel pop-up menu.
 
3. In the Merge Channels dialog box, choose your desired color mode, as 
shown in Figure 1-6.
 
 Any modes that are unavailable 
are grayed out. You may not have 
enough channels for the grayed-
out modes.
 
4. Enter the number of channels 
you want.
 
 When you choose your mode in 
Step 3, Photoshop automatically 
fills in the number of channels for 
the mode. If you deviate and enter something different, the file becomes 
a multichannel file.
 
5. Click OK.
 
6. Select your channels in the 
dialog box that appears.
 
 In my example, the Merge CMYK 
Channels dialog box appears. If 
you want to merge the channels 
normally, make sure that each 
channel matches (Red for Red, and 
so on). If you want to rearrange the 
channels, you can mix them, as I 
did in Figure 1-7, so that the Cyan 
channel is mixed with the Magenta 
channel, and so on.
Figure 1-6: Choose the color mode and 
number of channels in this dialog box.
Figure 1-7: You can mismatch your 
channels when merging them to create a 
unique effect.

7. If you’re merging into a multichannel image, 
click Next.
 
 Repeat this step for each channel.
 
8. Click OK.
 
 You’ve now merged your files into a single 
image, which appears in your Photoshop 
window.
 
 Photoshop closes individual channel files and 
merges any spot channels as alpha channels.
 
 Check out Figure 1-8 to see how my sunflower 
went from yellow to magenta just by merging 
the layers a little differently.
 
If you have an image that includes alpha or spot 
channels, select Multichannel from the Mode drop-
down list in Step 3; otherwise, Photoshop doesn’t 
include those channels in the merged image. After 
you merge the image, Photoshop gives all the 
channels the names Alpha 1, Alpha 2, Alpha 3, and 
so on. To get back to a color composite, choose 
Image➪Mode➪RGB Color or CMYK Color.
Using Painting and Editing 
Tools with Channels
Sometimes, it’s better to edit individual channels 
rather than the composite image. Mediocre flatbed 
scanners often reproduce, and digital cameras 
sometimes capture, an image that’s slightly soft or out of focus. You may want 
to counteract that effect by applying an Unsharp Mask or Smart Sharpen filter. 
Before you do, you should examine each channel separately. You may find 
that the Blue channel contains a lot of garbage — 
artifacts, dithering, and other nasty crud.
 
Blue channels are notorious for acquiring this junk, so try to avoid sharpening 
this channel unless you really want to accentuate what’s already ugly.
Instead of applying the Unsharp Mask or Smart Sharpen filter on Blue chan-
nels, select the Red and Green channels in the Channels panel and then 
choose Filter➪Sharpen➪Unsharp Mask or Smart Sharpen. Similarly, you can 
apply a Gaussian Blur filter to a channel to soften the unsightly pattern (called 
a moiré pattern) caused by scanning a halftone. (See Book VII, Chapter 1 for 
more on moiré patterns, and filters are covered throughout Book VII.)

Using Painting and Editing Tools with Channels

Although Unsharp Mask, Smart Sharpen, and 
Gaussian Blur are a few corrective filters that you’ll 
use frequently, I also find it useful to apply a 
special-effect filter to individual channels. Some-
times, applying a filter to the composite image pro-
duces an effect that’s, well, overdone. Applying the 
filter to one or two channels can produce an effect 
that’s subtler and less in-your-face. For example, in 
Figure 1-9, I applied a filter to just the Blue channel 
for the flower on the top. Using individual channels 
can also be useful for applying filters that produce 
monochromatic images, such as the Graphic Pen 
or Photocopy filters (be sure your foreground and 
background colors are black and white). If you 
apply the filter to the entire image, you get a black-
and-white image. If you apply it to an individual 
channel, you retain some color.
You can select a color channel and then edit that 
channel by using a painting or editing tool in the 
image. Keep these facts in mind:
 
✓ Painting with white adds the color channel’s 
color at full intensity in the composite image.
 
✓ Painting with black removes the color in the 
composite image.
 
✓ Painting with a value of gray adds color at varying levels of intensity in 
the composite image.
For example, if you paint with white on the Blue channel in an existing 
image, Photoshop adds more blue to the color composite image. But if you 
paint with black, Photoshop adds yellow to the image because when you 
remove blue, you’re left with the opposite (or complementary) color — 
yellow. To perform this channel magic, select the Brush tool and then select 
your desired brush size from the Options bar. Select your desired color in 
the Color panel. Select the channel you want to edit in the Channels panel 
and paint on the image. You can see the results by selecting the composite 
channel in the Channels panel. Refer to Figure 1-9 to see how I gave a flower 
a channel-color makeover.
 
The results are a little different if you try this technique on a blank CMYK 
canvas. For example, when you paint with black on the Cyan channel, your 
composite color image displays cyan. When you paint with white, you get 
no change.

individual color channels, you

color (bottom).

Introducing Alpha Channels
463
Book VI
Chapter 1
Using Channels
Introducing Alpha Channels
You use alpha chan-
nels for selections 
that are incredibly 
detailed or that you 
want to save and 
reuse. To make that 
selection, an alpha 
channel uses black, 
white, and shades of 
gray to create a mask. 
The selected pixels are 
white, and unselected 
pixels are black. For 
example, in the alpha 
channel of the image 
shown in Figure 1-10, 
the selection includes 
the lanterns and trees; 
they appear white in 
the alpha channel. If an 
alpha channel includes 
gray areas, those areas 
are partially selected 
(or partially unse-
lected, depending on 
whether you think the glass is half full or half empty).
You can create a mask by first duplicating a color channel and then edit-
ing that channel with painting and editing tools and filters. (See Book VI, 
Chapter 3 for the details.) You can also create an alpha channel by saving a 
selection you’ve created. After you create a channel mask or save a selection 
as an alpha channel, you can load that channel to use it as a selection in any 
image. The following sections explain how to save a selection as an alpha 
channel and load a selection.
Saving a selection as an alpha channel
One of the great things about alpha channels is that you can save them and 
then retrieve them time and time again, which can be especially handy if 
you’ve taken a lot of time and effort to create the selection. Why reinvent 
the wheel if you want to select the element again in the future? Sure, you 
can create a mask by using Quick Mask mode and Color Range (see Book VI, 
Chapter 2), but those masks are only temporary.

After you make the initial selection, saving it is a piece of cake. Follow 
these steps:
 
1. Make a selection in your image (see 
Book III for help).
 
2. Choose Select➪Save Selection.
 
 You can also click the Save Selection as 
Channel button (a circle on a square icon) 
at the bottom of the Channels panel. A new 
channel appears with the default name of 
Alpha 1, bypassing Steps 3 and 4.
 
3. Select a destination image in the Document 
pop-up menu.
 
 You can select your current image, any other 
open image that has the same pixel 
dimensions, or a new image.
 
4. Select a destination channel from the 
Channel pop-up menu.
 
 You can select a new channel, an existing 
alpha channel, or a layer mask. (See Book VI, Chapter 3 for more 
on layer masks.)
 
• If you select New, name the channel.
 
• If you select an existing alpha channel or layer mask, select your 
desired operation: Replace, Add To, Subtract From, or Intersect. 
These commands add to, subtract from, or intersect your current 
selection with the existing alpha channel.
 
5. Click OK.
 
 Your alpha channel is complete and appears in the Channels panel, as 
shown in Figure 1-11.
Loading an alpha channel
If you’ve gone through the trouble of creating an alpha channel, it’s no doubt 
because you want to easily load (or access) the selection again and again. To 
load an alpha channel, use any one of these many methods:
 
✓ Choose Select➪Load Selection. In the Load Selection dialog box, select 
your document and channel. Click Invert to swap selected and unse-
lected areas. If your image has an active selection, choose how you want 
to combine the selections.
 
✓ Select the alpha channel in the Channels panel, click the Load Channel 
as Selection icon at the bottom of the panel, and then click the 
composite channel.

Using Channels
 
✓ Drag the channel to the Load Channel as Selection icon.
 
✓ Ctrl-click (Ô-click on the Mac) the alpha channel in the Channels panel.
 
✓ Ctrl+Shift-click (Ô+Shift-click on the Mac) to add the alpha channel to an 
active selection.
 
✓ Ctrl+Alt-click (Ô+Option-click on the Mac) to subtract the alpha channel 
from an active selection.
 
✓ Ctrl+Alt+Shift-click (Ô+Option+Shift-click on the Mac) to intersect the 
alpha channel with an active selection.
 
Adding channels can start to bloat your file size, so use them judiciously. 
The Photoshop native format and TIFF format compress channel information 
and therefore are good file formats to use when working with a lot of chan-
nels. The only formats that preserve alpha channels are Photoshop, TIFF, 
PDF, PICT, Pixar, Photoshop Raw. BMP, TGA (Targa), and PSB (Photoshop

The Channel Mixer actually does what its name implies — it mixes color 
channels. This feature lets you repair bad channels and produce grayscale 
images from color images. It also allows you to create tinted images and 
more intense special effects. Finally, it allows you to do the more mundane 
tasks of swapping or duplicating channels.
Although some Photoshop elitists 
worldwide tout the Channel Mixer as 
an advanced feature not to be mucked 
with by amateurs, I say, “Give it a 
whirl.” Intimidation is a nasty road-
block to creative fun. Just make a 
backup copy of an image before diving 
into the mix by following these steps:
 
1. Select the composite channel in 
the Channels panel.
 
 If you have an RGB image, the com-
posite channel is the RGB channel; 
for CMYK
 images, it’s the CMYK channel.
 
2. Choose 
Image➪Adjustments➪Channel 
Mixer.
 
 The Channel Mixer dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 1-12.
 
3. If desired, select a Preset from the pop-up menu.

the Channel Mixer enables you to repair 
bad channels.

 CS4 provides an assortment of Black and White presets you can use 
to convert your color images to grayscale. This is a great conversion 
method because it preserves detail and provides very good contrast 
control.
 
4. For Output Channel, select the channel in which to blend one or more 
source (existing) channels.
 
 For example, if your Blue channel is lousy, select it from the 
Output Channel drop-down list. Note that if you’re using one of the 
black-and-white presets, you have only the Gray channel available.
 
5. Drag any source channel’s slider to the left to decrease the channel’s 
effect on the Output channel or drag to the right to increase the effect.
 
 Because my Blue channel contains artifacts and dithering picked up by 
the scanner, I’m raising the Red and Green values from 0% to 25% and low-
ering the Blue value from 100% to 50%. To retain good contrast, try to use 
a combo of Red, Green, and Blue values that add up to close to 100%.
 
 You can also enter a value from –200% to +200%. Using a negative value 
inverts the color data of the source channel.
 
6. Tinker with the Constant option to add a Black or White channel of 
varying opacity.
 
 This option adjusts the grayscale value of the selected Output channel. 
Drag the slider to a negative value to get a Black channel. Positive values 
give a White channel.
 
 This option brightens or darkens the overall image, but it may cause 
strange color shifts if adjusted to the extreme. I recommend leaving it at 
0 most of the time. But try it. It may help.
 
7. Select Monochrome to apply the same settings to all output channels, 
producing a color image that has only values of gray.
 
 This is another great way to produce a grayscale image from a color 
image. Adjust the individual sliders to mix the values until you’re satis-
fied with the contrast.
 
 You can save (and load) any of your custom settings by clicking the 
Preset Option button just to the left of the OK button.
 
8. Click OK to exit the Channel Mixer.
 
 After you exit the Channel Mixer, choose Image➪Mode➪Grayscale to 
complete the conversion.
 
 If you select and then deselect the Monochrome option, you can modify 
the blend of each channel separately. By doing so, you can create color 
images that appear to be hand-tinted with color inks. Go for the subtle 
treatment or a more intensely colored look.
 
 Swapping color channels can produce some bizarre color effects. For 
example, try selecting the Red channel from the Output Channel drop-
down list. Set the Red source channel to 0 and then set the Green source

channel to 100. Try other combinations, Green for Blue, Blue for Red, 
and so on. Sometimes, they can be downright freakish, but occasionally 
you may stumble on one that’s worthy.
Putting It Together
Giving Flat Art Highlights and Shadows
Sometimes, you need to give your art — whether it’s a photo or another type of image — 
a little shine and shadow to bring it to life. You can do this by creating and saving your se-
lections as alpha channels and ﬁ lling them with translucent color. The great thing about 
alpha channels is that because you save them with your document, you can use them 
time and time again. Just follow these steps:
 
1. Create a simple piece of artwork to use as a basis for your shadows and highlights.
 
 I created a pool ball by creating two layers. On each 
layer, I used the Elliptical Marquee tool to create 
different-sized circles. I ﬁ lled each circle with a 
separate color, as shown in the ﬁ gure. To follow 
along with these steps, you can download this im-
age from this book’s Web site (see the Introduction 
for details).
 
2. Choose Window➪Channels.
 
 The Channels panel appears.
 
 Be sure to keep this panel visible because you’ll be 
creating new channels for the highlights.
 
3. Select the Pen tool from the Tools panel and create a path for the highlight.
 
 I created a path for 
the highlight on the 
top-left portion of the 
ball in my example, 
assuming that the 
light source is com-
ing from the upper-
left corner. If the Pen 
tool seems like a 
foreign object to you, 
check out Book III, 
Chapter 2.

4. Choose Window➪Paths.
 
 The Paths panel appears.
 
5. Click the Load Path as Selection icon (a dotted circle) at the bottom of the Paths 
panel.
 
 Your work path disappears and a selection marquee appears.
 
6. Choose Select➪Save Selection.
 
 The Save Selection dialog box appears.
 
7. Name the channel. Make sure to select New Channel under Operation and click 
OK.
 
 An additional channel appears in the Channels panel, as shown in the preceding 
ﬁ gure. This new channel is the alpha channel — your saved selection.
 
8. Click the Create a New Layer icon (the dog-eared page) in the Layers panel. 
Double-click the layer name and rename it.
 
 I named mine large highlight.
 
 Putting your highlights and shadows on separate layers is important so that you 
can apply different opacity settings and also retain the ability to tweak them later, if 
needed.
 
9. Choose Edit➪Fill, select the White option for Contents, and leave all the other op-
tions at their default settings. Click OK to close the Fill dialog box.
 
 Your highlight is now ﬁ lled with white. Don’t worry; it won’t stay this opaque.
 
10. In the Layers panel, adjust the Opacity setting to 50%.
 
 The highlight now appears translucent (refer to the preceding ﬁ gure).
 
11. Select the Pen tool and create a path for the 
highlight on the bottom of the object, as seen in the 
ﬁ gure.
 
 Make sure the path matches up to the edge of the 
object. Use the Direct Selection tool if you need to 
adjust the anchor points or curve segments of the 
path.
 
12. In the Paths panel, click the third icon from the left 
at the bottom of the panel.
 
 The work path disappears, and a selection marquee appears.

13. Choose Select➪Save Selection. In the Save Selection dialog box that appears, name the 
channel. Make sure to select New Channel under Operation and click OK.
 
 Mine is called bottom highlight. Another alpha channel appears in the Channels panel.
 
14. Repeat Steps 8 through 10, but adjust the opacity to only 30%.
 
15. Use the Pen tool to create a path for the smaller shadow.
 
 For example, I created a path on the bottom-right of the ball.
 
16. Load the path as a selection in the Paths panel and choose Select➪Modify➪Feather. 
In the Feather Selection dialog box, enter 3 pixels and click OK.
 
 The idea is to give the shadow a softer edge.
 
17. Repeat Steps 6 through 10, but ﬁ ll the selection 
with black, rather than white, and adjust the 
opacity to 20%.
 
 The shadow is shown in the ﬁ gure.
 
18. Use a selection tool to add a cast shadow.
 
 In my example, I used the Elliptical Marquee tool to 
create an ellipse at the base of the ball by holding 
down Alt (Option on the Mac) and dragging the 
mouse, shown in the ﬁ gure.
 
 Then I feathered the selection 25 pixels before I 
saved the selection.
 
 The cast shadow needs to have really fuzzy edges, 
thus the large number of pixels for the feather.
 
19. Repeat Steps 8 and 9, ﬁ lling the selection with 
black.
 
 My highlighted and shadowed pool ball is ready to 
roll, shown in the ﬁ gure.
 
 If your cast shadow layer is above your object, you have to change the stacking order 
and move your shadow layer so that it’s below your object.
 
 Now that you’ve spent all this time on the front end creating your alpha channels, you 
can save time on the back end by using those alpha channels to apply highlights and 
shadows to similar artwork.

ing new layers, ﬁ lling them with color, and adjusting their opacity.
 
 In my example, I took the highlights and shadows I created with lucky pool ball 
number 7 and loaded them as alpha channels in pool ball number 5.

Chapter 2: Quick-and-Dirty 
Masking
In This Chapter
✓ Using Quick Masks
✓ Working with Color Range
✓ Selecting by erasing
M
asking is essentially just another way of making a selection. Instead 
of defining your selection with a selection outline, masks define your 
selection with up to 256 levels of gray, which allows you to have varying lev-
els of selection. Photoshop masks (or protects) unselected pixels from any 
commands you execute. Photoshop doesn’t mask selected pixels, making 
them fair game to any executed commands.
Different types of masks have different purposes — channel 
masks, layer masks, and vector masks. You can use them to 
temporarily make a selection, save and load selections, 
define vector shapes, selectively apply an adjustment 
layer or filter, blend one layer into another, and so 
on. Although selecting with the Marquee, Lasso, 
Magic Wand, and Pen tools can be fine, you’ll soon 
find that these tools have a limited repertoire: You 
can’t use them with much accuracy on more com-
plex images. That’s when you turn to masking.
Most things that pack a powerful punch are either 
expensive or hard to master, or both. Well, you 
already forked out a pretty penny for Photoshop. And 
yes, masking isn’t for those who get their selections via 
a drive-thru window. To help you with the learning curve, 
in this chapter, I ease you into masking by using Photoshop’s 
automated masking tools. Although they aren’t quite as accurate 
as the hardcore masking I cover in Book VI, Chapter 3, they’re easier on you, 
and with certain images (or a serious time crunch), the quick-and-dirty masking 
tools get the job done.

Working with Quick Masks
472
Working with Quick Masks
As you can probably guess from the name, Quick Masks allow you to create 
and edit selections quickly without having to bother with the Channels 
panel. Although you don’t really create an end-product mask per se, the way 
you go about getting your selection is “mask-like.” They’re also user-friendly 
in that they allow you to see your image while you’re working. You can begin 
your Quick Mask by using a selection tool or a painting tool. After you have 
your Quick Mask, you can edit the mask by using any painting or editing tool.
 
Quick Masks are temporary, so if you create one you really like, be sure to 
choose Select➪Save Selection at the end of the following steps. (Note that 
you have to be out of Quick Mask mode to do this.) That way, you can save 
the selection as an alpha channel. For more on saving selections as alpha 
channels, see Book VI, Chapter 1.
Follow these steps to create your very own Quick Mask:
 
1. Open a new document and, using any selection tool, select the element 
you want in your image.
 
 Don’t worry about getting the selection perfect. You can fine-tune your 
selection after you have the Quick Mask in place. Note that you can also 
just paint your mask from scratch. But I think that starting with a selec-
tion is easier.
 
 
2. Click the Edit in Quick Mask Mode button in the Tools panel (or press 
the Q key).
 
 If your Quick Mask settings are at the default, a color overlay covers and 
protects the area outside the selection, as shown in Figure 2-1. The 
selected pixels are unprotected.

the unselected (or protected) areas.

3. Refine the mask by using a painting or editing tool.
 
 Paint with black to add to the mask, thereby 
making the selection smaller. Even though 
you’re painting with black, your strokes show 
up as a red overlay, as shown in Figure 2-2. This 
red overlay is a visual carryover from back in 
the day when artists used rubylith (red trans-
parent material) to mask portions of their art 
during airbrushing. Paint with white to delete 
from the mask, making the selection larger. 
Paint with a shade of gray to partially select the 
pixels. Partially selected pixels take on a semi-
transparent look, perfect for feathered edges.
 
 
4. After you finish editing your mask, shown in Figure 2-3, click 
the Edit in Standard Mode button in the Tools panel to exit the 
Quick Mask.
 
 You can also press the Q key.
 
 The overlay disappears, and a selection outline appears. Your selection 
is ready and waiting for your next command. The selection outline cor-
relates with the unmasked or selected areas of the Quick Mask. Don’t be 
surprised if the wispy or soft edges you so diligently selected aren’t 
readily apparent when you switch back to normal editing mode. When 
you composite your selected image with another, your hard quick-
masking work will be evident.
 
You can change Quick Mask options by double-clicking the Quick Mask 
Mode button in the Tools panel. When you add a Quick Mask to a selection, 
by default, a red overlay covers the masked area. The overlay has an opacity 
setting of 50%. In addition to changing the color (to provide better contrast 
with your image, perhaps) and opacity of the overlay, you can also choose 
whether you want the overlay to represent the masked (unselected, pro-
tected) areas or the selected (unprotected) areas.
Using the Color Range Command
The Color Range command allows you to select similarly colored pixels in a 
selection or within an entire image. You can think of it as a smarter Magic 
Wand tool (which I talk about in Book III, Chapter 1). Unlike the Magic Wand 
tool, however, Color Range lets you adjust your selection before you ulti-
mately get the selection outline. It does this by using Fuzziness (a cousin of 
Tolerance, also discussed in Book III, Chapter 1), which allows you to select 
colors relative to how closely they resemble the sampled colors. Photoshop 
selects all the identical colors, partially selects similar colors, and doesn’t 
select dissimilar colors. You adjust the fuzziness, and Photoshop adjusts 
the selection.

Quick Mask.

convert your mask into a selection outline (bottom).
Starting with Color Range basics
Here are some Color Range command tips before you get started:
 
✓ You can save and load Color Range settings by clicking the appropriate 
buttons in the dialog box. But heck, after you have a selection, you can 
also choose Select➪Save Selection to save it as an alpha channel.
 
✓ You can select a color range based on preset colors or tones that you 
choose from the Select drop-down list. For example, choosing red auto-
matically selects all the red in the image. Choosing midtones selects all 
the medium-range tones in the image. And Out-of-Gamut (only available 
for RGB and Lab modes) selects all colors that can’t be printed by using 
CMYK colors. For more on modes, see Book II, Chapter 2.

 If you choose the Color Range command when you have an active selection, 
Photoshop selects only colors within the selection outline and ignores the 
rest of your image.
Executing the Color Range command
Follow these steps to work with the Color Range command:
 
1. Choose Select➪Color Range.
 
 The Color Range dialog box appears in full glory.
 
2. Choose Sampled Colors from the Select drop-down list and then select 
the Eyedropper tool in the dialog box.
 
3. Select a display option — Selection or Image.
 
 I recommend leaving the setting at the default of Selection so that you 
can see the mask while you build it. You can toggle between the two 
views by pressing Ctrl (Ô on the Mac).
 
4. Either in the image itself or in the image preview in the Color Range 
dialog box, click to sample your desired colors.
 
 The image preview changes to a mask. Black areas show unselected pix-
els, white areas show selected pixels, and gray areas show partially 
selected pixels.
 
 Your goal is to try to make what 
you want to select all white and 
what you don’t want to select all 
black, as shown in Figure 2-4. And 
if you want some things partially 
selected, they can remain gray.
 
5. Adjust the selection by adding or 
deleting colors.
 
 You can select or delete as many 
colors in your image as you want.
 
 Use the Add to Sample tool (the 
plus eyedropper icon) to add, and 
use the Subtract from Sample tool 
(the minus eyedropper icon) to 
delete.
 
 You can be lazy like me and just 
stick with the regular eyedropper 
icon. Simply hold down Shift+Alt 
(Shift+Option on the Mac) to add 
and delete.

command, your desired selection area 
appears white in the preview box.

6. Fine-tune the range of colors by dragging the Fuzziness slider.
 
 The Fuzziness ranges extend from 0 to 200. A higher value selects more 
colors, and a lower value selects fewer colors. While you adjust the fuzz-
iness, the mask dynamically updates.
 
 If you can’t quite get the control you want with the Fuzziness slider, try 
selecting the new Localized Color Clusters option. Instead of just main-
taining a single color cluster from the colors you select, this option 
enables you to select multiple color clusters. This option can help with 
obtaining cleaner, more precise selections, especially when you’re try-
ing to select more than just one color. Adjust the Range slider to fine-
tune the range, or area, of your selection.
 
 The Invert option selects what’s currently unselected and deselects 
what’s currently selected. And if you totally muck things up, you can 
reset the dialog box by holding down Alt (Option on the Mac) and click-
ing Reset.
 
7. Select a Selection Preview from the drop-down list to preview the 
selection in the image window.
 
• None: Displays the image normally
 
• Grayscale: Displays just the grayscale mask
 
• Black Matte and White Matte: Displays the selection against a black 
or white background
 
• Quick Mask: Shows the mask over your image, using your Quick 
Mask settings.
 
8. Click OK.
 
 Your image appears with a selection outline based on the Color 
Range mask.
 
 Now, do what you will with your nice, clean selection.
 
 I decided my Thai dancer needed to be in a more exotic locale, so I 
transported her (by dragging and dropping with the Move tool onto 
another image) to a mystical Shangri-La, shown in Figure 2-5.
Selective Erasing with the Eraser Tools
The eraser tools let you erase portions of an image to the background color, 
to transparency, or even to the way your image looked earlier in your editing 
session. There are three eraser tools — the regular Eraser, the Magic Eraser, 
and the Background Eraser. All three share a tool flyout menu.
The eraser tools look like real erasers, so you can’t miss them. But just in 
case you do, press E and then Shift+E to toggle through the three tools.

When you erase pixels, those pixels are gone. Gone. For good. Before using 
the eraser tools, it might be wise to make a backup of your image. You can 
save the image either as a separate file or as another layer. That way, if 
things run amuck, you have some insurance.
Erasing to the background or transparency
 
 The Eraser tool allows you to erase areas on your image to either the 
background color or to transparency. Select the Eraser tool, drag through 
the desired area on your image, and you’re done.
If the image contains just a background, you erase to the background color, 
as shown in Figure 2-6. If the image is on a layer, you erase to transparency.
I rate this tool in the same category as the Lasso tool. It’s quick, it’s easy, but 
it has limited applications. Use it only for minor touchups. The Eraser tool 
definitely isn’t a tool to use on its own for making accurate selections.
 
The most useful function I find for the Eraser tool is to clean up my channel 
masks. Set the mode to Block, zoom into your mask, and clean up those black- 
and-white pixels. See Book VI, Chapter 3 for more on channel masks.

Figure 2-6: The Eraser tool erases either to the background color (left) or, if on a layer, to

These options on the Options bar control the Eraser tool:
 
✓ Mode: Select from Brush, Pencil, and Block. When you select Brush or 
Pencil, you have access to the Brush Preset picker panel on the far left 
of the Options bar.
 
 Use the Brush Preset drop-down picker panel to select from a variety of 
brush sizes and styles. Block has only one size, a square of 16 x 16 pix-
els. But because the block size remains constant, if you zoom way in, 
you can perform some detailed erasing.
 
✓ Opacity: Specify a percentage of transparency for the erasure. Opacity 
settings less than 100 percent only partially erase the pixels. The lower 
the Opacity setting, the less it erases. This option isn’t available for the 
Block mode.
 
✓ Flow: Set a flow rate percentage when using Brush mode. Flow specifies 
how fast Photoshop applies the erasure and is especially handy when 
using the Airbrush option.
 
✓ Airbrush: Click the button when using Brush mode to turn your brush 
into an airbrush. With this option, the longer you hold your mouse 
button down, the more it erases.

✓ Brush Panel: Click the toggle button to bring up the full Brushes panel.
Selecting and erasing by color
 
 The Magic Eraser tool works like a combination Eraser and Magic Wand 
tool. It both selects and erases similarly colored pixels:
 
✓ When you click a layer: The Magic 
Eraser tool erases pixels of a similar 
color based on a specified range 
and leaves the area transparent, as 
shown in Figure 2-7.
 
✓ When you click the background: 
The Magic Eraser tool automati-
cally converts the background to a 
layer and then does the same 
thing.
 
✓ When you click a layer with 
locked transparency: The Magic 
Eraser tool erases the pixels and 
replaces the area with the back-
ground color.
The Tolerance value defines the range 
of colors that Photoshop erases, just 
like it does with the Magic Wand tool. 
The value determines how similar a 
neighboring color has to be to the 
color that you click. A higher value picks up more colors, whereas a lower 
value picks up fewer colors. In my example in Figure 2-7, I set my Tolerance 
value to 8 and clicked in the upper-left of my image. Photoshop selected and 
erased only a limited shade of black due to my lower Tolerance setting.
Here are the other options:
 
✓ Anti-Alias: Creates a slightly soft edge around the transparent area.
 
✓ Contiguous: Selects only similar colors that are adjacent to each other. 
Deselect this option to delete similar-colored pixels wherever they 
appear in your image.

✓ Sample All Layers: Samples colors using data from all visible layers, but 
erases pixels on the active layer only.
 
✓ Opacity: Works like it does for the regular Eraser tool.
Removing an image’s background
 
 The Background Eraser tool is probably the most sophisticated of 
the eraser-tool lot. It erases away the background (in the composition of the 
image, not the Layers panel) from an image and leaves the foreground 
untouched — in theory, anyway.
Like the Magic Eraser tool, the Background Eraser tool erases to transpar-
ency on a layer. If you drag on the background, Photoshop converts the 
background into a layer.
To use the Background Eraser tool, you 
need to carefully keep the crosshair 
that appears in the center of the cursor, 
also known as the hot spot, on the back-
ground pixels while you drag. Then 
Photoshop deletes all background pix-
els under the brush circumference. But, 
if you get close to a foreground pixel 
with the hot spot, that pixel is gobbled 
up, as well. As you can see from my 
example in Figure 2-8, I got a little too 
close to the man’s face in some spots, 
and it left him a little chewed up.
Here’s the rundown on the options, 
found on the Options bar, for the 
Background Eraser:
 
✓ Brush Preset picker: Provides vari-
ous settings to customize the size 
and appearance of your eraser tip. 
The size and tolerance settings at 
the bottom are for if you use a pres-
sure-sensitive drawing tablet. You 
can base the size and tolerance on the pen pressure or position of the 
thumbwheel.
 
✓ Sampling: The three settings (represented by icons) determine what 
areas should and shouldn’t be erased. The default Continuous setting 
allows you to sample colors continuously while you drag through the 
image. The Once setting erases only areas that contain the color you 
first clicked. If the background is pretty much one color, you can try this 
option. The Background Swatch setting erases only the areas containing 
the background color.
Background Eraser chews up man’s face.

✓ Limits: The Contiguous setting erases similar colors that are adjacent to 
one another. The Discontiguous setting erases similar colors whenever 
they’re under the brush tip, regardless of whether they’re adjacent. The 
Find Edges setting erases contiguous pixels while retaining the sharp-
ness of the edges.
 
✓ Tolerance: Works just like the Magic Eraser Tolerance setting.
 
✓ Protect Foreground Color: Prevents you from erasing areas that match 
the foreground color.
Putting It Together
Framing a Photo with Quick Mask
Sometimes, you may want to add a decorative border or edge to your image. Maybe 
you’re creating a postcard or greeting card, and the standard rectangular shape image 
just doesn’t provide enough pizzazz. Although adding a border or edge might look 
difﬁ cult, it is a snap with the Quick Mask 
command. Just follow these steps:
 
1. Using any selection tool, create a 
selection on your image.
 
 I started with a rectangle in my image 
and then chose Select➪Inverse to turn 
the selection inside out.
 
2. Click the Edit in Quick Mask Mode 
button in the Tools panel.
 
 A color overlay covers and protects the 
area outside the selection, as shown in 
the figure.
 
 Your selected area is open for you to 
edit as you so desire.
 
3. Grab the Brush tool, choose the Heavy 
Stipple brush, and set the brush diam-
eter to 168 pixels.
 
 You can find the Heavy Stipple brush in 
the Wet Media Brushes library of the 
Brushes panel. See Book IV, Chapter 1 
for more on the Brushes panel.
 
4. Paint around the edges of the mask with black to add to the masked area.

the steps, clicking around the image and also in the interior of the mask.
 
 Because white adds to the selected area, your image starts to show through.
 
 I ended up with a mottled mess, shown in the figure.
 
 You can also apply a filter or adjustment (Image➪Adjustment) to the Quick Mask. See 
this technique in action in Book VII, Chapter 2.
 
8. Click the Edit in Standard Mode button to exit the Quick Mask mode.
 
 The overlay disappears, leaving you with a selection outline, shown in the figure.
 
 The selection outline correlates with the unmasked or selected areas of the Quick 
Mask. If you had a feathered mask, such as mine, the selection outline runs halfway 
between the selected and unselected areas of the mask, creating a soft transition.
 
9. Your selection is ready and waiting for 
your next command.
 
 In my example, I deleted my selection, 
thereby filling the hole with my back-
ground color of white and leaving me 
with a stippled image. Note that 
because my brush was feathered and 
also varied in the Flow settings, some of 
my image is also feathered and 
semitransparent.

Advanced Masking Techniques
In This Chapter
✓ Creating and editing layer masks
✓ Using vector masks
✓ Working with channel masks
I
f you haven’t already checked out Book VI, Chapter 2, which covers 
Photoshop’s quick and easy masking tools, you might want to breeze 
through that chapter first, especially if the word mask brings to mind an 
image from Halloween rather than a selection technique. In this chapter, I 
dive into some manual masking techniques.
Layer masks are tremendously useful, and if 
you’re like me, you’ll find yourself addicted to 
them. They can be fantastic for blending layers 
and making multiple images dissolve into one 
another. Vector masks create shapes defined by 
vector paths and produce clean, smooth-edged 
graphic elements.
Channel masks are probably the most time-con-
suming of the masking lot, but they’re powerful 
and accurate. Like anything in life, the more you 
practice using them, the faster and better you get.
But Photoshop CS4 includes a new feature to help 
in your masking tasks — the Masks panel. This 
handy panel enables users to add, control, and 
refine masks of all sorts.
After you get through this final chapter of Book VI, you’ll be familiar with 
every masking technique Photoshop has to offer. By then, you’ll be pre-
pared to use masks to select a very hairy orangutan, dyed green, perched in 
a tree in a lush rainforest. And how many people can say that?

Introducing the Masks Panel

Introducing the Masks Panel
 
This new panel, shown in Figure 3-1, enables you to add, control, and refine 
your layer, vector, and filter masks. I explain layer and vector masks in 
the sections “Working with Layer Masks” and “Creating and Editing Vector 
Masks,” later in this chapter. Details on filter masks can be found in Book VII, 
Chapter 1. For now, I cover just the features in this panel because they may 
assist you in getting your mask exactly the way you want it:
 
✓ Thumbnail: Shows what layer or mask is currently selected in your file.
 
✓ Add Pixel Mask/Select Pixel Mask: Click this icon to add a layer mask. If 
you added a layer mask by another means, such as via the Layers panel 
or Layer menu, the icon is automatically selected. Remember that when 
working with masks, black hides areas of your image, white shows areas 
of your image, and any gray areas are partially hidden at varying per-
centages, depending how dark or light the gray is.
 
✓ Add Vector Mask/Select Vector Mask: Click this icon to add a vector 
mask. If you added a vector mask by another means, the icon is auto-
matically selected.
 
✓ Select Filter Mask: This icon appears only when a Smart Filter has been 
applied. For more on Smart Filters, see Book VII, Chapter 1.
 
✓ Density: Think of this option as a kind of opacity control for your mask. 
To lessen the transparency of the masked (or hidden) area, select the 
mask and drag the slider to the left.
 
✓ Feather: The Feather option softens the edges of the mask, creating 
more of a dissolve between your layers when creating a composited 
image. To see the effect on the actual mask itself, hold down Alt (Option 
on the Mac) and click the mask thumbnail in the Layers panel, which 
temporarily hides the layer and shows only the mask. Hold down Alt 
(Option on the Mac) and click to display the layer again.
 
✓ Mask Edge: Click this button to bring up the Refine dialog box. In this 
dialog box, you can fine-tune the edges of your masks to your liking. For 
an explanation of the Refine dialog box, see Book III Chapter 1.
 
✓ Color Range: Click this button to open the Color Range dialog box. Color 
range is yet another way to create a selection or mask. For details on 
this feature, see Book VI, Chapter 2.
 
✓ Invert: This option reverses the colors of the mask. Therefore, black 
areas become white, white becomes black, dark gray converts to light 
gray, and so on.
 
✓ Load Selection from Mask: Click this option to load your mask as a 
selection. Note that the black areas of your mask are unselected, the 
white areas are selected, and the gray areas are partially selected. For 
more on selections, see Book III.

✓ Apply Mask: Click this icon to have your mask permanently applied to 
the layer. The mask is then deleted. Be careful when applying this option 
because you can no longer edit the mask and refine your visible areas.
 
✓ Disable/Enable Mask: Click this icon to show or hide your mask.
 
✓ Delete Mask: Click the trashcan icon to delete the mask.
 
✓ Mask Options: This first command in the panel pop-up menu enables 
you to change the color and opacity of your mask overlay.
 
✓ Add Mask to Selection, Subtract Mask from Selection, Intersect Mask 
with Selection: These commands, also in the panel pop-up menu, allow 
you to add to, delete from, or intersect with existing selections made 
from your masks.
 
✓ Close/Close Tab Group: The final commands in the panel pop-up menu 
close the Masks panel and the group that the Mask panel belongs to, 
respectively.

Working with Layer Masks
Like any other mask, a layer mask is a grayscale image that you can edit to 
your heart’s content. Layer masks are excellent for blending layers of images 
together and creating soft transitions between elements.

Working with Layer Masks
486
For versatility, layer masks are unparalleled. They allow you to gradually brush 
in transparency and opacity on a selective pixel basis. Paint with black to hide 
portions of the layer; paint with white to display portions; and paint in varying 
shades of gray to partially show elements. You can even apply gradients, image 
adjustments, and filters to your layer masks to create interesting special effects.
After you get the concept of layer masks, you’ll never use the eraser tools 
(covered in Book VI, Chapter 2) again. You won’t have to because one of the 
great things about layer masks is that you can forever edit, or even delete 
them, with no permanent harm whatsoever to the image.
Creating layer masks
To create a layer mask, select your desired layer and choose Layer➪Layer 
Mask➪Reveal All or Hide All.
 
✓ Reveal All: Creates a mask filled with white, which shows the layer
 
✓ Hide All: Creates a mask filled with black, which hides, or masks, the 
layer and shows nothing but transparency
You can also click the Add Layer Mask icon at the bottom of the Layers 
panel (which, by default, selects Reveal All). Or you can click the Add a Pixel 
Mask icon in the new Masks panel.
 
You can’t add a layer mask to a background layer. You must convert the 
background layer to a regular layer if you want to use a layer mask on 
the background of an image.
 
You can also use an existing selection to create a layer mask. Select your 
desired layer and make a selection by using one of the selection tools. 
Choose Layer➪Layer Mask➪Reveal Selection or Hide Selection. You can also 
click the Add Layer Mask button in the Layers panel to create a mask that 
reveals the selection.
After you create the layer mask, you can grab the painting tool of your 
choice and apply your grayscale color. Remember: Add white to the mask to 
display the image. Add black to hide the image. Add gray to make the layer 
semitransparent.
Using the Gradient and Brush tools on a layer mask
I must confess: I use two of the layer masking tools more than the others:
 
✓ The Gradient tool: Setting this tool to a linear gradient of black to white 
or white to black is truly awesome. Select the layer mask in the Layers 
panel and drag with the Gradient tool on the layer mask to create the 
gradient. The darker areas of the gradient gradually hide the image, 
whereas the lighter areas gradually show the image.

Book VI
Chapter 3

Techniques
 
✓ The Brush tool: With a large, feathered tip, using the Airbrush option 
and the Flow set to around 10%, this tool is amazing. With these set-
tings in place, you can create feathered edges that blend one layer into 
another without any harsh lines. Again, select the layer mask in the 
Layers panel and drag with the Brush tool on the layer mask.
In Figure 3-2, which is an image with two layers (the flag on the bottom and 
the girl on top), I used a combination of both these tools. I started with the 
black-to-white linear gradient, which I dragged from the left edge of my image 
through to the right edge. I then took the Brush tool with a large feathered tip 
(265 pixels), selected the Airbrush option, set the Flow to 10%, set my fore-
ground color to black, and worked my way around the profile of the girl’s face 
to get rid of some more of the background behind her.

To edit a layer mask, click the Layer Mask thumbnail in the Layers panel. 
Select your desired painting or editing tool, and paint or edit the mask to 
perfection. Just be sure that you’re working on the layer mask, rather than 
editing the image itself. Otherwise, you apply paint directly to your image. 
You can tell because you see brackets around the layer mask thumbnail in 
the Layers panel. You also see the Pixel Mask icon highlighted and the mask 
thumbnail displayed in the Masks panel.
Managing layer masks
Here are some tips to help you work with your layer masks. You can do the 
following:
 
✓ Load a layer mask. Loading a 
layer mask means getting a selec-
tion outline based on the layer 
mask. Simply Ctrl-click (Ô-click on 
the Mac) the Layer Mask thumb-
nail. You can also click the Load 
Selection from Mask icon in the 
Masks panel.
 
✓ View the mask without viewing 
the image. Sometimes when you’re 
editing a layer mask, you may find 
it helpful to see the mask itself 
without having to view the image, 
too. For example, in Figure 3-3, I 
hid the image of the little girl and the flag to see the layer masks. Simply 
Alt-click (Option-click on the Mac) the Layer Mask thumbnail to view the 
mask and hide the image on the layer.
 
 To redisplay the image, Alt-click (Option-click on the Mac) again or click 
the eye icon in the far left column.
 
✓ View the layer mask as a red overlay. If you prefer to see your layer 
mask as a red overlay (called a rubylith), Alt+Shift-click (Option+Shift-
click on the Mac) the Layer Mask thumbnail. You can also click the eye-
ball icon on the layer mask in the Channels panel.
 
✓ Click again with the same keys to remove the overlay. You can change 
the opacity and color of the overlay in the Layer Mask Display Options 
dialog box, which you access by double-clicking the layer mask channel 
in the Channels panel. You can also change it by selecting Mask Options 
from the Masks panel pop-up menu.
 
 A rubylith is similar to the red overlay used with Quick Masks, covered 
in Book VI, Chapter 2.
 
✓ Paste a copied selection into a layer mask. Simply Alt-click (Option-
click on the Mac) the Layer Mask thumbnail. Choose Edit➪Paste and 
Figure 3-3: Check out just your layer mask 
without the image.

Techniques
then choose Select➪Deselect. Click the image thumbnail in the Layers 
panel to return to the image.
 
 The copied selection can consist of anything, but this technique comes 
in particularly handy when you’re copying one layer mask into another.
 
✓ Disable (temporarily hide) or enable a layer mask. Just Shift-click the 
Layer Mask thumbnail or choose Layer➪Layer Mask➪Disable or Enable. 
Or click the Disable/Enable Mask icon in the Masks panel.
 
✓ Unlink a layer from its layer mask. By default, Photoshop links a 
layer mask to the contents of the layer. This link allows them to move 
together. To unlink a layer from its layer mask, click the link icon in the 
Layers panel. Click the icon again to re-establish the link. You can also 
choose Layer➪Layer Mask➪Unlink or Link.
 
✓ Delete a layer mask. Just drag the Layer Mask thumbnail to the trash-
can icon in the Layers panel. Click Delete in the dialog box. Or you can 
choose Layer➪Layer Mask➪Delete. Finally, click the Delete (trash-can) 
icon in the Masks panel.
 
✓ Apply a layer mask. When you apply a layer mask, you essentially fuse 
the mask to the layer, so your mask is permanently applied to the layer. 
Photoshop replaces all black areas in the mask with transparent pixels 
and all gray areas with partially transparent pixels; all white areas are 
unaffected. Drag the thumbnail to the trash-can icon in the Layers panel. 
Click Apply in the dialog box. You can choose Layer➪Layer Mask➪Apply 
or click the Apply Mask icon in the Masks panel.
Putting It Together
Making a Photo Gradually Fade from Color to Grayscale
Layer masks are extremely powerful when it comes to 
blending multiple images so that one seems to dissolve 
into the others. In this project, I don’t show you how to 
use a layer mask to blend different images, but rather 
the same image — one in color and one in grayscale. 
Follow these steps:
 
1. Open a copy of your favorite color image, like the 
one shown in the ﬁ gure.
 
 The subject matter isn’t critical here, so feel free 
to whip out that old prom picture.

2. Choose Image➪Duplicate.
 
 Accept the default name and click OK in the dialog box that appears.
 
3. With the duplicate image active, choose Window➪Channels.
 
 View each of the channels to ﬁ nd the one that gives you the best grayscale image.
 
4. Select your desired channel in the Channels panel.
 
 If you need a refresher on channels, see Book VI, Chapter 1. The Red channel gives the 
best contrast for the portrait in my example. Because skin tones tend to have a lot of 
red in them, the Red channel usually provides the best grayscale image of a person.
 
5. Choose Image➪Mode➪Grayscale and click OK in 
the Discard Other Channels alert box.
 
 Photoshop has now stripped the color from the im-
age, shown in the ﬁ gure.
 
 This is only one way to convert a color image to 
grayscale. There are a lot of others. Check them out 
in Book II, Chapter 2.
 
6. Choose Window➪Layers.
 
 The Layers panel appears.
 
7. Holding down the Shift key with the Move tool 
selected, drag and drop your grayscale image onto 
your color image.
 
 This action automatically creates a new layer from 
the grayscale image. (See Book V for more information about layers.)
 
 By holding down the Shift key, you keep the grayscale image centered over the color 
image.
 
8. Close your duplicate image.
 
9. Press D to access the default colors.
 
 This step gives you a black foreground swatch and a white background swatch in 
your Tools panel.
 
 Now, I show you how to use one of my favorite techniques, a black-to-white gradient, 
on the layer mask.
 
10. Make sure that the grayscale layer is the active layer in the Layers panel and click 
the Add Layer Mask icon at the bottom of the panel.
 
 It’s the icon that looks like a dark square with a white circle on top. Photoshop adds a 
second thumbnail on your layer, indicating that a layer mask has been applied.
 
 A layer mask acts like a piece of clear acetate over your layer.

11. Select the Gradient tool and then select the default gradient of Foreground to 
Background.
 
 To get the default gradient, click the Gradient Picker on the Options bar and select 
the ﬁ rst gradient.
 
 It should be a gradient of white to black because it’s based on the current fore-
ground and background colors, which reverse when you select the Layer Mask 
thumbnail. For a gradient refresher, see Book IV, Chapter 2.
 
12. Drag the gradient from the top of your image to the bottom.
 
 Or from left to right. Or at a diagonal. It’s your call.
 
13. Experiment with long drags and short drags. The angle and length of your mouse 
movement determine how the layer mask reveals the underlying image.
 
 In my example, I dragged from the bottom of the image to the top and stopped about 
two-thirds of the way up.
 
 Where black appears on the layer mask, the grayscale image is hidden. Where 
white appears on the mask, the grayscale image shows through and everything in 
between allows the grayscale image to partially show.
 
 Although I used a linear gradient in my example, you can experiment with the other 
types, as well. Radial gradients can provide some interesting effects.
 
14. When you complete your mask, save and close the ﬁ le.

Creating and Editing Vector Masks
492
Creating and Editing Vector Masks
Whereas layer masks let you create soft-edged masks, vector masks create 
hard-edged masks defined by shapes created by a vector path on a layer. 
Vector-based shapes produce clean, smooth, and well-defined edges that are 
never jagged. And you can size and transform vector shapes without ever 
degrading the appearance of the element. (For an introduction to vector 
images, see Book IV, Chapter 1.)
You create a vector mask when you create a shape with any one of the shape 
tools. You can also create a vector mask when you convert type to a shape 
(Layer➪Type➪Convert to Shape). See Book IV, Chapter 3.
Adding a vector mask to a layer
To add a vector mask to layer, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the layer in the Layers panel and choose Layer➪Vector 
Mask➪Reveal All or Hide All.
 
 I describe Reveal All and Hide All in the “Creating layer masks” section, 
earlier in this chapter. Remember that you can’t add a vector mask to a 
background layer. You can also click the Add a Vector Mask icon in the 
Masks panel.
 
2. Select the Paths icon in the Options bar. On the vector mask, create a 
path with the Pen tool or grab any shape tool and create a shape.
 
 See Book III, Chapter 2 for more on paths and Book IV, Chapter 1 for 
more on shapes.
 
 I selected the Custom Shape tool and dragged a sunburst shape on my 
vector mask. Notice how everything inside the path (represented by 
the white area on the vector mask thumbnail) is visible and everything 
outside the path (represented by the gray areas on the vector mask 
thumbnail) is hidden, or masked, as shown in Figure 3-4.
 
 Like layer masks, you can add vector masks only to layers, not back-
grounds. If necessary, simply convert your background to a layer by 
double-clicking the background in the Layers panel.
 
3. If your vector mask is satisfactory, save your file and then close it.

Another way to add a vector mask is to select your desired layer, draw a 
work path with the Pen tool or one of the shape tools, and then select 
Layer➪Vector Mask➪Current Path.

Managing vector masks
Here are a few vector mask tips. You can perform the following tasks:
 
✓ Edit a vector mask path. Use the pen tools and the Direct Selection tool, 
as described in Book III, Chapter 2.
 
✓ Add multiple shapes or paths to the existing vector mask. All you need 
to do is drag another shape with any of the shape tools. Or add another 
path with the Pen tool. You can also add, delete, and intersect shapes 
and paths using the Add, Subtract, Intersect and Exclude icons in the 
Options bar.
 
✓ Remove a vector mask from a layer. Drag the thumbnail to the trash 
icon in the Layers panel or choose Layer➪Vector Mask➪Delete. You can 
also click the Delete (trash) icon in the Masks panel.
 
✓ Disable (temporarily hide) or enable a vector mask. Shift-click the 
vector mask thumbnail or choose Layer➪Vector Mask➪Disable (or 
Enable). You can also click the Disable/Enable Mask icon in the Masks 
panel.

Creating Channel Masks
494
 
✓ Rasterize a vector mask. Rasterizing 
(or turning the mask into a pixel-
based image) converts the vector 
mask into a layer mask. Choose 
Layer➪Rasterize➪Vector Mask.
 
✓ Apply layer styles to vector shapes. 
This is a quick and easy way to 
create buttons for a Web page or a 
custom logo, as shown in Figure 3-5. 
Just select the layer, not the vector 
mask, and choose Layer➪Layer 
Style. Select your style of choice. 
For details on layer styles, see 
Book V, Chapter 4.
Creating Channel Masks
Photoshop’s channel masks are probably the most time-consuming masks to 
use because they require a lot of manual labor. Not heavy lifting, mind you, 
but work with the tools and commands in Photoshop.
But, don’t get me wrong, it’s time well spent. Channel masks can usually 
accurately select what the other Photoshop tools can only dream about — 
wisps of hair, tufts of fur, a ficus benjamina tree with 9,574 leaves.
You can create a channel mask in a lot of ways, but I’m here to offer you one 
that works most of the time. To create a channel mask, follow these steps:
 
1. Analyze your existing channels to find a suitable candidate to use to 
create a duplicate channel.
 
 This is usually the channel with the most contrast between what you 
want and don’t want. For instance, in my example, the Red channel 
provided the most contrast between the windmills and the sky, which I 
wanted to mask, and the background, which I didn’t.
 
 To duplicate the channel, drag your desired channel thumbnail to the 
New Channel icon at the bottom of the Channels panel. After you dupli-
cate the channel, it then becomes an alpha channel.
 
2. Make sure the alpha channel is selected in the Channels panel and 
choose Image➪Adjustments➪Levels.
 
 Using the histogram and the sliders in the Levels dialog box, increase 
the contrast between the element(s) you want and don’t want selected. 
Click OK when you’re done to close the dialog box.
Figure 3-5: Adding layer styles to your 
shapes can make them really shine.

3. Select a tool, such as the Brush or Eraser tool, and paint and edit the 
alpha channel to refine the mask.
 
 See Figure 3-6. I used the combo of the Brush and Eraser set to Block 
mode to clean up my mask.
 
4. When you complete the mask, click the Load Channel as Selection 
icon (the dotted circle icon on the far left) at the bottom of the 
Channels panel. Then click your composite channel at the top of the 
list of channels.

Figure 3-6: Use the Levels and Photoshop painting and 
editing tools to refine your channel mask.
 
 This step loads your mask as a selection, giving you that familiar selec-
tion outline. You can also use one of my favorite keyboard shortcuts: 
Ctrl-click (Ô-click on the Mac) directly on the alpha channel to load the 
mask as a selection.
 
 Your selection is now ready to go.
 
5. You can leave it within the original image, or drag and drop it onto 
another image with the Move tool, as I did in Figure 3-7.
 
 Because my new sky was darker than my original, I also darkened my 
windmills so the lighting would be more consistent. If you’ve done a good 
job, nobody will be the wiser that the two images never met in real life.

Putting It Together
Masking Hair, Fur, and Other Wispy Things
Hair, fur, fuzz, and other objects with complex or loosely deﬁ ned edges can prove difﬁ cult 
to select with the run-of-the-mill selection techniques. But that’s where masking can 
save the day. Because a mask allows for a 256-level selection, it does a great job of pick-
ing up those elusive strands of hair and such that would otherwise probably be cut off in 
the selecting process.
Perhaps you’ve seen those photos where everyone in a composite image appears to 
have helmet hair? Here are the steps to avoid the Aqua Net look and select even the 
smallest wisp of hair:
 
1. Choose File➪Open.
 
 Select an image that contains something hairy, furry, or fuzzy. A portrait is an ideal 
choice (unless the subject is hair challenged).
 
 For your ﬁ rst attempt at this technique, starting with an image that has a pretty 
simple and uncluttered background is best.
 
 In my example, I used an image of a pensive, young urban professional shown in the 
ﬁ gure.

2. Choose Window➪Channels.
 
 View each channel by clicking the channel 
name in the Channels panel.
 
 Each channel is an independent grayscale 
image and a potential starting point for a 
mask.
 
 It’s best to start with the channel that con-
tains the most contrast between what you 
want to select and what you don’t. If it’s a 
toss-up, go with the channel that makes 
selecting the difﬁ cult part of the image 
easiest (in my example, that’s the hair, so I 
chose the Red channel).
 
3. Choose Duplicate Channel from the Chan-
nels panel pop-up menu. In the Duplicate Channel dialog box, name the channel mask 
and click OK.
 
 You’ve created an alpha channel for the mask, shown in the ﬁ gure. Now, you can edit 
the mask without harming the original channel.
 
4. Make sure the alpha channel is selected in the Chan-
nels panel and choose Image➪Adjustments➪Levels. 
Boost the contrast in the image by dragging the Input 
sliders for shadows, midtones, and highlights.
 
 Make the element(s) you want to select to be all white 
or all black with a little gray in the wispy areas. In other 
words, you want to change most of the pixels in the im-
age to either black or white.
 
 If you need help using the Levels adjustment, see Book 
VIII, Chapter 1.
 
 Remember, the goal is to select the person and his or her hair. You can do that in one of 
two ways:
 
✓ By selecting the person
 
✓ By selecting the background ﬁ rst and then inverting the selection
 
 In a mask, traditionally, white represents a selected area, black represents an unselect-
ed area, and gray represents a partially selected area.
 
 In my example, because my guy is darker than the background, I adjusted the contrast 
to make the subject as black as I could while making the background lighter. You can 
see the result in the ﬁ gure.

5. When you’re done, click OK to close the Levels dialog box.
 
6. Reﬁ ne the mask by selecting the Eraser tool and selecting Block Mode from the 
Options bar.
 
 The Block Eraser is a great tool for cleaning up masks. It allows you to paint inside 
the mask without creating any feathered edges
 
 
7. Press D to access the default colors.
 
 Remember the Eraser tool paints with the background color, so be sure you have the 
color you want before you drag. Press X to switch the foreground and background 
colors.
 
8. Clean up your mask by painting with black and 
white, as shown in the ﬁ gure.
 
 Make sure to use short strokes so you can undo any 
mistakes you make.
 
9. Use the Zoom tool if you need to touch up the 
details.
 
 The Block Eraser tool has only one size, so you have 
to zoom in to paint thinner strokes and zoom out to 
erase a larger area.
 
 Remember to leave some gray around the wispy 
areas, as seen in the ﬁ gure; otherwise, they may 
look chopped off.
 
 Take your time and be as accurate as you can. Patience makes a big difference.

 If you’re not sure what you need to 
paint on the mask and you want to 
refer to the color image, simply click 
the composite channel (either RGB or 
CMYK, depending on your image) at the 
top of the Channels panel. Then click 
the mask channel again to return to 
your mask. Or, you can view both the

ly. Your mask appears as a red overlay.
 
 Your mask is reﬁ ned and ready to go.

enter a value somewhere between 0.5 pixel (for a low-resolution image) to 2 pixels 
(for a high-resolution image). Feathering allows for a soft, natural-looking transition 
between your masked element and the background. I used a 1-pixel feather for my 
image.
 
11. Return to the composite image by clicking the RGB channel (or CMYK, if warranted).
 
 The selection outline appears in your 
composite image, shown in the ﬁ gure.
 
12. If you need to invert your selection, 
choose Select➪Inverse.
 
 In my example, I just ﬁ lled my back-
ground with a solid color, so I left the 
background selected.
 
13. Choose Window➪Color and mix a color 
of your choice. Choose Edit➪Fill, and in 
the Fill dialog box, choose Foreground 
Color for your Contents, and click OK.
 
 Photoshop now replaces the back-
ground with a solid color. Check the 
edges to see how clean your mask is.

14. Make any ﬁ nal edits you need to make.
 
 My guy looked like he spent too much 
time at the local tanning booth, so I 
toned down the redness in his skin by 
using the Variation commands (see 
Book VIII, Chapter 1), as seen in the 
ﬁ gure.
 
15. When you’re happy with your channel 
mask, save and close the ﬁ le.
 
 It takes practice to get masking down 
to a science, but believe me, it’s worth 
your time. Nine times out of ten, a 
channel mask lends a much better se-
lection than any of the easier, quicker 
selection tools and techniques.
 
 Instead of ﬁ lling the background with 
a color, you can also open a second image and, with the Move tool, drag and drop 
your masked element into the second image. A couple of things to keep in mind 
when compositing with two images: First, try to use two images whose lighting isn’t 
so dissimilar that it looks artiﬁ cial. Take into account the time of day, the angle of the 
light, and so on. Second, try to select two images whose levels of focus make sense. 
If you need to soften one of the images, apply the Gaussian Blur ﬁ lter. If your mask is 
good, your person should look right at home in his or her new digs.

ot an image that needs to be sharper or 
maybe less dusty? How about an image that 
needs to look like it was wrapped in plastic and 
then xeroxed on a circa-1970 photocopier? Either 
way, this is the book that describes the fine-tuning 
and the folly of filters. 
Filters can do wonders in correcting your images, 
making them look better than the original. And if 
it’s special effects you’re interested in, look no fur-
ther. Filters can make your image look ripped, 
sprayed, wet, hot — and just about any other 
adjective you’re interested in. The best news is 
that Photoshop offers Smart Filters — filters that 
work their magic without damaging your pixels. If 
distortions are more your thing, you won’t be dis-
appointed with the Liquify command, for which 
image warping, pushing, bloating, and puckering 
are daily activities.

F
ilters have a long and glorious history, ranging from per-
forming essential tasks (such as removing abrasive 
particles from the oil in your car’s crankcase) to even 
more important chores involving the pixels in your 
Photoshop images. In both cases, filters (also called 
plug-ins because they can be installed or removed 
from Photoshop independently) seize tiny, 
almost invisible bits of stuff and rearrange them 
in useful ways. The results are something you’d 
never want to do without.
This chapter introduces you to the basics of 
Photoshop’s filter facilities and starts you on the 
road to plug-in proficiency.
You Say You Want a Convolution?
All filters do one simple thing in a seemingly complicated way: They make 
Photoshop do your bidding. Deep within a filter’s innards is a set of instruc-
tions that tells Photoshop what to do with a particular pixel in an image or 
selection. Photoshop applies these instructions to each and every pixel in 
the relevant area by using a process the techies call convolution (creating a 
form or shape that’s folded or curved in tortuous windings), but which we 
normal folk simply refer to as applying a filter.

504
You Say You Want a Convolution?
Corrective and destructive filters
Filters fall into two basic categories:
 
✓ Corrective filters: Fix problems in an image. They fine-tune color, 
add blur, improve sharpness, or remove such nastiness as dust and 
scratches. Although corrective plug-ins can be fairly destructive to cer-
tain pixels, they don’t change the basic look of an image, in general. You 
might not even notice that a corrective filter has been applied unless 
you compare the new version of the image with the original.
 
✓ Destructive filters: Tend to obliterate at least some of an image’s origi-
nal detail (some to a greater extent than others) while they add special 
effects. They may overlay an image with an interesting texture, move 
pixels around to create brush strokes, or distort an image with twists, 
waves, or zigzags. You can often tell at a glance that a destructive filter 
has been applied to an image: The special effect often looks like nothing 
that exists in real life.
An unaltered image (such as the image on the left in Figure 1-1) can be 
improved by using a corrective filter such as Unsharp Mask (center) or 
changed dramatically with a destructive filter such as Find Edges (right).

Figure 1-1: Filters range in variety from the corrective (center) to the destructive (right).
Filter basics
Whether a filter is corrective or destructive, it falls into one of two camps. 
Here’s the scoop:
 
✓ Single-step filters: The easiest filters to use, single-step filters have no 
options and use no dialog boxes. Just select the filter from the menu 
and watch it do its stuff on your image or selection. The basic Blur and 
Sharpen filters are single-step filters.

505
Book VII
Chapter 1

Introducing Smart Filters
 
✓ Mini-application filters: Most 
filters come complete with at 
least one dialog box, along with 
(perhaps) a few lists, buttons, and 
check boxes. And almost every 
mini-app filter has sliders you can 
use to adjust the intensity of an 
effect or parameter (see Figure 
1-2). These filters are marked in 
the menus with an ellipsis (a series 
of dots) following their names; like 
with other menu commands that 
show those dots, it’s an indication 
that more options are lurking.
The controls themselves are easy to 
master. The tricky part is figuring out 
what the various parameters you’re 
using actually do. How does chang-
ing brush size affect your image when 
you’re using a brush-stroke filter? What 
happens when you select a particular 
pattern with a texturizing filter? You 
can read descriptions of how various filter controls affect your image, but 
your best bet is to simply experiment until you discover the effects and 
parameters that work best for you. Just be sure that you save a copy of the 
original image; filters do permanent damage to files — modifying, adding, 
and deleting pixels.
 
Adobe has added a new command under the Filter menu — Browse Filters 
Online. As this book went to press, selecting this command launches your 
browser and takes you to the Photoshop section of www.adobe.com. At the 
moment, I’m not sure what plans Adobe has for this new feature, but I’m 
sure it will be good!
Introducing Smart Filters
A couple versions ago, Photoshop gave us the great feature of Smart 
Objects. The last version sweetened that feature even more with the addi-
tion of Smart Filters. In my humble opinion, Smart Filters is one of the best 
recent features of Photoshop. Smart Filters are the same filters we all know 
and love, but they are applied to your image non-destructively. Technically, 
the filters are applied to your pixel data, but Photoshop always retains the 
original pixel data inside the Smart Object. Then, each time a filter is edited, 
Photoshop installs the original pixel data and re-applies the filter. Never 
mind how it’s done behind the curtain; just know that Smart Filters act like 
layer effects, appending themselves to your layer, where they can be edited, 
Figure 1-2: Mini-application filters require 
you to specify various settings before 
applying your filter.

rearranged, and deleted at any time. For more on Smart Objects, see Book V, 
Chapter 5. 
Here are the steps to apply a Smart Filter:
 
1. Create a Smart Object by doing one of the following:
 
• Choose File➪Open As Smart Object. Select your file and click Open.
 
• In an existing file, choose File➪Place. Select your file, size and posi-
tion the image to your liking, and press the Commit button in the 
Options bar in Photoshop.
 
• Select a layer in the Layers panel and choose Layer➪Smart 
Objects➪Convert to Smart Object.
 
• Select a layer in the Layers panel and choose Filter➪Convert for 
Smart Filters.
 
• Copy and paste Illustrator content as a Smart Object into Photoshop.
 
2. Select your desired filter from the Filter menu.
 
 Any filter applied to a Smart Object becomes a Smart Filter.
 
 Your Smart Filter is appended beneath your Smart Object layer, as 
shown in Figure 1-3.

 You can also apply the Shadow/Highlight and Variations adjustments as 
Smart Filters. These are found under the Image➪Adjustments submenu.

Introducing Smart Filters
 
 When you add a Smart Filter to a 
layer, Photoshop automatically adds 
a layer mask, represented by the 
white thumbnail in the Layers panel, 
as shown in Figure 1-4. Technically, 
when a layer mask is applied to a 
smart filter, it’s called a filter mask. 
Correspondingly, an alpha channel 
appears in the Channels panel.
 
 By default, the entire filter is dis-
played, as evidenced by an all-white 
filter mask. But the application of a 
filter mask enables you to selectively 
hide and show the effects of the filter, 
if you want. If you made a selection 
on the layer before applying a Smart 
Filter, the mask will reflect that selec-
tion. For more Smart Filter masking 
details, see the following bulleted list. 
For information on masking in general, 
check out Book VI.
 
 
 Note that Adobe has added a Masks 
panel which enables you to control 
and fine-tune masks of all types—layer 
masks, vector masks, and filter masks. 
Check out Book VI, Chapter 3 to find 
out details on using this great panel.
 
3. Edit the filter as often as you like 
by simply double-clicking the filter 
name in the Layers panel.
 
 You can also right-click (Control-click on the Mac) on the filter name to 
access a context menu from which you can select Edit Smart Filter (refer 
to Figure 1-3).
 
 Your filter’s dialog box appears, enabling you to adjust the parameters, 
as desired. You can’t edit single-step filters (those that don’t display a 
dialog box but are automatically applied). You can, however, double-
click to reapply certain filters, such as Clouds and Difference Clouds, in 
the Render filter menu.
 
4. (Optional) If desired, adjust the blend modes and opacity settings of 
the Smart Filter by right-clicking (Control-clicking on the Mac) on the 
filter line in the Layers panel to access a context menu. From that 
menu, select Edit Smart Filter Blending Options.
 
 In the dialog box that appears, select your desired blend mode from 
the Mode pop-up menu. Adjust your opacity by entering a percentage 
or moving the slider. This is a great way to tone down the effect of the 
Filter mask

with their own mask.

Introducing Smart Filters
filter and achieve a more subtle appearance. Doing so is similar to fading 
a filter (described in the section “Fading a Filter,” later in this chapter), 
only better because you can infinitely edit the settings.
 
5. Add as many filters as you need to the Smart Object.
 
 Filters reside in a grouped stack.
 
6. (Optional) If you no longer want the filter, delete it by selecting it in 
the Layers panel and dragging it into the trash at the bottom of the 
panel.
 
 To delete an entire Smart Filter group (multiple filters), grab the Smart 
Filters line in the Layers panel and drag it into the trash. You can also 
delete the filters by right-clicking (Control-clicking on the Mac) on the 
filter name and selecting Delete Smart Filter from the context menu that 
appears. You can also delete all filters by right-clicking (Control-clicking 
on the Mac) on the Smart Filters line in the Layers panel and choosing 
Clear Smart Filters from the context menu.
Here’s everything else you need to know about the ins and outs of working 
with Smart Filters:
 
✓ Any file format that supports layers, such as PSD, TIFF, and PDF, sup-
ports Smart Filters.
 
✓ You can’t apply Liquify or Vanishing Point as Smart Filters.
 
✓ Click the eye icon next to the filter name in the Layers panel to display 
or hide the individual Smart Filter. Click the eye of the Smart Filters 
group to toggle on or off all the filters.
 
✓ When executing commands, such as a transformation (scale, rotate, and 
so on), on a layer that has a Smart Filter, Photoshop alerts you that it’ll 
turn off the Smart Filter in the preview during the transformation and 
reapply it after the transformation is complete. You may check the Do 
Not Show Again option to bypass the alert box from then on.
 
✓ You can rearrange the order of multiple filters by dragging them up or 
down the list in the Layers panel.
 
✓ To move a smart file, drag the filter from one Smart Object layer to 
another. To copy Smart Filters, hold down Alt (Option on the Mac) while 
dragging.
 
✓ In the cases of multiple filters, only a single filter mask is applied to all 
filters within the group.
 
✓ You can use most of the same tools used to edit regular layer masks, 
such as the Brush and Gradient tools, to edit filter masks.
 
✓ You can adjust the Density and Feather options of the filter mask by 
using the Masks panel. See Book VI, Chapter 3 for details.

Sharpening What’s Soft
 
✓ Filter masks aren’t linked to the Smart Objects, so if you move either one 
with the Move tool, the other doesn’t move along with it.
 
✓ To hide the filter mask, hold down Shift and click the filter mask thumb-
nail in the Layers panel. You can right-click (Control-click on the Mac) 
on the filter mask thumbnail and select Disable Filter mask from the con-
text menu that appears.
 
✓ To delete the filter mask, drag the thumbnail to the trash at the bottom 
of the Layers panel. You can also right-click (Control-click on the Mac) 
on the filter mask thumbnail and select Delete Filter Mask from the con-
text menu that appears. In addition, you can also add, subtract, or inter-
sect the mask as a selection in this same context menu.
 
✓ To display just the filter mask, hold down Alt (Option on the Mac) and 
click the filter mask thumbnail in the Layers panel.
 
✓ To add a filter mask, right-click (Control-click on the Mac) the Smart 
Filter line in the Layers panel and select Add Filter Mask from the con-
text menu that appears.
 
Sometimes, when converting from one color mode to another, such as when 
going from RGB to CMYK, certain filters can’t be supported. Photoshop 
prompts you with an alert box saying so and asks you whether you want 
to rasterize the layer. Rasterizing essentially converts your Smart Object 
into a regular layer and fuses your Smart Filters onto that layer. Bye-bye, 
Smart Filter. If you choose not to rasterize, any Smart Filters that can’t be 
displayed are annotated with an alert icon (a triangle with an exclamation 
mark) in the Layers panel.
Sharpening What’s Soft
Sometimes, your images aren’t as sharp as you want. Sometimes, your 
images have a tiny bit of softening caused by scanning an image or perhaps 
by capturing a photo on your digital camera. Or perhaps you want only a 
particular part to be sharper so that it stands out from its surroundings.
All sharpening tools operate by increasing the contrast between adjacent 
pixels. If you look at a sharpened image side by side with the original version 
(as shown in Figure 1-5), you see that no new information has been provided. 
Instead, the contrast is boosted so edges are more distinct. The dark parts 
of the edges are darker; the light parts at their boundaries are lighter.
Photoshop has six main sharpening features, only five of which are actu-
ally filters, on the Filter➪Sharpen menu. The sixth (the Sharpen tool) isn’t a 
filter, strictly speaking. It is a tool in the Tools panel and is more like a paint-
brush that lets you sharpen areas selectively by using strokes.

510
Sharpening What’s Soft
Figure 1-5: Sharpening an image boosts the contrast of neighboring pixels and gives the illusion 
of improved focus.
Sharpen
The Sharpen filter is best used for minimal touchups in small areas. This 
single-step filter increases the contrast between all the pixels in the image 
or selection. Although this filter makes the image look sharper, it can add a 
grainy look to solid areas that aren’t part of the edges.
Sharpen More
The Sharpen More filter, a single-step filter, increases the contrast between 
pixels even more than the regular Sharpen filter. Like the Sharpen filter, 
Sharpen More is best relegated to noncritical sharpening because it doesn’t 
do a very good job of sharpening large areas. Also, it doesn’t provide the 
control you need for more intense projects.
Sharpen Edges
The Sharpen Edges filter is a single-step filter that’s superior to the Sharpen 
and Sharpen More filters because it concentrates its efforts on the edges of 
images, adding sharpness without making the image grainy or noisy. It’s best 
used for quickie fixes.
Smart Sharpen
The newest member of the Sharpen team is definitely a keeper: Smart 
Sharpen does a great job of detecting edges and sharpening them less 
destructively. Like the veteran Unsharp Mask filter, discussed in the next 
section, this filter gives you a lot of control over the sharpening settings, as 
shown in Figure 1-6. Here’s the scoop on those settings:

511

Figure 1-6: The Smart Sharpen filter gives the most control over your 
sharpening specifications.
 
✓ Preview: Obviously, keep this option checked so that you can take a 
gander at what’s happening as you sharpen. You’ll appreciate the large 
Preview window.
 
✓ Basic and Advanced: The only difference between the two views is that 
with the Advanced view, you can control the amount of sharpening in 
the Shadow and Highlight areas of your image. Use the following con-
trols to fine-tune the amount of sharpening in your light and dark areas:
 
• Fade Amount: Determine the amount of sharpening.
 
• Tonal Width: Specify the range of tones you want to sharpen. Move 
your slider to the right to sharpen only the darker of the shadow 
areas and the lighter of the highlight areas.
 
• Radius: Specify the amount of space around a pixel that’s used to 
determine whether a pixel is in the shadow or the highlight area. 
Move your slider to the right to specify a greater area.
 
✓ Settings: You can save your sharpening settings so that you can load 
them for later use without having to re-create them. Click the disk/down-
pointing arrow icon to do so.
 
✓ Amount: Use this control to vary the amount of edge sharpening. A 
higher value increases the contrast between pixels around the edges. 
Your choices range from 1 percent to 500 percent. For subtle amounts 
of sharpening, anything around 100 percent or less provides the effect 
you’re looking for without making the image appear overly contrasty 
(yes, that’s a technical term) or unrealistic.

512
Sharpening What’s Soft
 
✓ Radius: This slider controls the width (in pixels) of the edges that 
the filter will modify. The higher the value, the wider the edge that’s 
affected. Your range varies from 0.1 pixel (for fine control) to 64 pixels 
(for broader sharpening effects). How you use this control varies chiefly 
on the resolution of your original image. Low-resolution images (100 
pixels per inch and lower) look best when you use only a small radius 
value, from a fraction of a pixel up to 3 or 4 pixels.
 
 A good rule to consider when you select a radius is to divide your 
image’s ppi resolution by 150 and then adjust from there. For example, if 
you have a 150 ppi image, set the radius at 1 and then tweak from there.
 
✓ Remove: Specify the algorithm to be used to remove the blurriness in 
the image. Gaussian Blur is the method used by Unsharp Mask and is 
good for removing that hazy type of blurriness. Lens Blur detects and 
sharpens the edges and detail in the image, and it does a good job of 
reducing those nasty halos that can occur from sharpening. Motion Blur 
reduces the blurriness that can occur when you move your camera (or 
your subject moves).
 
✓ Angle: Specify the direction of motion if you choose Motion Blur as your 
algorithm.
 
✓ More Accurate: Check this option to make Photoshop provide a more 
accurate removal of blurriness. It takes longer, but it’s worth the wait, as 
shown in Figure 1-7.
Figure 1-7: Smart Sharpen can take your soft, mushy photo and make it come to life.
Unsharp Mask
Don’t feel bad: Everyone is confused by the name Unsharp Mask the first 
time they encounter it. This filter provides a sophisticated attempt to dupli-
cate a sophisticated photographic effect called (you guessed it) unsharp 
masking, in which two sheets of film are sandwiched together to create a 
final image. One sheet is the original film negative (or a duplicate), and the 
second is a positive image (the “normal” photograph) that’s blurred slightly. 

513
Book VII
Chapter 1

Blurring What’s Sharp
When the two are put together, the light and dark areas cancel each other 
out, except at the edges — because of the blurring of the positive mask, 
which causes the edges to spread at those points.
Unsharp masking is a tricky procedure in the darkroom. It’s much more pre-
cise in the digital realm because Photoshop can easily control the width of 
the areas to be masked, as well as a relative brightness level to use before 
beginning to apply the masking effect.
In the Unsharp Mask dialog box, you can find two of the same controls that 
you have with Smart Sharpen (see the preceding section) — Amount and 
Radius. You also have another option called Threshold. Threshold controls 
the difference in brightness that must be present between adjacent pixels 
before the edge is sharpened. That is, you need to have a distinct contrast 
between adjacent pixels along an edge in order to sharpen the edge. Your 
choices range from brightness values of 0 to 255. Selecting a low value 
emphasizes edges with very little contrast difference (which is usually what 
you want). You’re generally better off leaving this control at 0 unless your 
image has a lot of noise. Higher values force Photoshop to provide edge 
sharpening only when adjacent pixels are dramatically different in bright-
ness. Increasing the threshold too much can cause some harsh transitions 
between sharpened and unsharpened pixels.
 
In most cases, the Amount and Radius sliders are the only controls you need 
to use. Threshold is most useful when the first two controls create excessive 
noise in the image. You can sometimes reduce this noise by increasing the 
Threshold level a little.
 
Sharpening always increases contrast, so keep this in mind if you plan 
on adjusting the contrast of your image with other commands and tools. 
Sharpening is usually one of the last commands you apply when correcting 
and enhancing your images.
Blurring What’s Sharp
What, me blurry? The answer is yes, if you have an image that contains 
unwanted grain (the roughness or noise added by the photographic film) or 
perhaps an ugly pattern of halftone dots used in a printed image.
You might need to blur a background to make the foreground seem sharper 
or blur a portion of an image to create an angelic glow. Here are your blur-
ring options (all in the Filter➪Blur menu):
 
✓ Average: This single-step filter calculates the average value (or color) 
of the image or selection and fills the area with that average value. This 
option can help you smooth the values of areas that contain a lot of 
noise.

514
Blurring What’s Sharp
 
✓ Blur: Also a single-step filter, Blur provides overall blurring of an image.
 
✓ Blur More: This filter provides a significantly increased amount of blur-
ring compared to the regular, old-fashioned Blur filter.
 
✓ Box Blur: The Box Blur filter blurs your image in the shape of, well, a 
box or square.
 
✓ Gaussian Blur: This filter offers a radius control to let you adjust the 
amount of blurring more precisely. It also has a really cool name.
 
 The Gaussian Blur filter is an excellent tool because it gives you a great 
deal of control over the amount and type of blurring you get, especially 
when compared to the single-step Blur and Blur More filters, which 
apply a fixed amount of blur. Use these latter two filters when you 
simply want to de-sharpen an image a tad, and turn to Gaussian Blur 
when you’re looking for a specific effect.
 
✓ Lens Blur: This filter simulates the blurring that can occur when you 
capture an image with a camera. For details, see the sidebar “Applying 
the Lens Blur filter,” in this chapter.
 
✓ Motion Blur: This filter simulates the blur you see in objects that are 
moving.
 
✓ Radial Blur: This filter produces the kind of blur you might get when 
photographing a revolving automobile tire. You can also get a zoom 
effect with this filter.
 
✓ Shape Blur: The Shape blur basi-
cally blurs your image according 
to the shape you choose from 
the panel. The shape choices you 
have are the same as those with 
the Custom Shape tool. Move 
the Radius slider to the right 
for a larger blur. You can see an 
example of different shape blurs in 
Figure 1-8.
 
✓ Smart Blur: This filter lets you 
control how Photoshop applies the blur to edges and other details of the 
image.
 
✓ Surface Blur: This filter blurs the surface or interior of the image, rather 
than the edges. If you want to preserve your edge details but blur every-
thing else, this is your filter.

image in a variety of shapes.

Smoothing with the Facet and Median Filters
Applying the Lens Blur filter
If you’ve ever played with the aperture settings 
on a camera, you’re probably well aware that 
you can determine how shallow or deep your 
depth of field is. Depth of field relates to the 
plane of focus (the areas in a photo that are in 
front of or behind the focal point that remain in 
focus) or how in-focus the foreground elements 
are when you compare them to the background 
elements. If you use a Lens Blur filter on an 
alpha channel (see Book VI, Chapter 1 for more 
on alpha channels), the alpha channel acts as 
a depth map. This approach is great for taking 
a fully focused image and creating a shallow 
depth of field in which the foremost object is in 
focus and the background elements get blurrier 
the farther they are from the focal point. You can 
achieve this effect by creating an alpha chan-
nel filled with a white-to-black gradient — black 
where you want the most focus, white where 
you want the least focus or most blur.
Here’s a brief description of setting the Lens 
Blur filter options:
 ✓ Source: If you have an alpha channel, 
select it from this pop-up menu. The Lens 
Blur option interprets the various gray-
scale values of the alpha channel and 
applies the blur according to the value set 
in the Blur Focal Distance option. Choose 
Transparency to make an image get blur-
rier while it gets more transparent. Choose 
Layer Mask to apply the blur according 
to the grayscale values on the layer mask 
(see Book VI, Chapter 3 for more on layer 
masks). If your image contains none of 
these options, choose None. Photoshop 
applies the blur on the image.
 ✓ Blur Focal Distance: Specifies how blurry 
or in focus an area of the image is. Drag 
the slider to specify the value or click the 
crosshair cursor on the part of the image 
that you want to be in full focus.
 ✓ Iris: The Iris settings are meant to simulate 
a camera lens. Specify the shape of the 
lens, as well as the radius (size of the iris), 
curvature, and rotation of that shape.
 ✓ Specular Highlights: The Lens Blur filter 
averages the highlights of an image, which, 
if left uncorrected, cause some highlights 
to appear grayish. These controls help to 
retain specular highlights, or those high-
lights which should appear very white. Set 
the Threshold value to specify which high-
lights should be specular (remain white). 
Set a Brightness value to specify how much 
to re-lighten any blurred areas.
 ✓ Noise: Blurring, of course, obliterates any 
noise (or film grain) that an image may 
have. This absence of noise can cause the 
image to appear inconsistent or unrealistic, 
in many cases. Drag the slider to add noise 
back into your image.
Smoothing with the Facet and Median Filters
One reason you might want to blur an image is to reduce dust and scratches, 
or to smooth away sharp edges. In the following sections, I show you how to 
use the versatile Facet and Median filters to soften an image.

516
Smoothing with the Facet and Median Filters
 
Although the Facet and Median filters smooth images by eliminating some 
detail, you can compensate for the blurring effect by applying the Smart 
Sharpen or Unsharp Mask (covered earlier in this chapter) with a low radius 
setting to sharpen things up a little.
The Facet filter
The Facet filter breaks up an image by using a posterizing effect. It gathers 
up blocks of pixels that are similar in brightness and converts them to a 
single value, using geometric shapes. (When you posterize an image, you 
reduce it to a very small number of tones.)
The geometric shapes make the image look more randomly produced, while 
eliminating much of the banding effect you get with conventional posterizing 
filters.
The effects of the Facet filter are subtle and best viewed at close range. The 
original image in Figure 1-9 contains some dust, scratches, and a few other 
defects. Instead of retouching them one by one, I used Facet.
Facet is a single-step filter, so you don’t need to adjust any controls. Just 
choose Filter➪Pixelate➪Facet and evaluate your results. You can apply the 
filter multiple times. However, even one application smoothes out the pic-
ture and eliminates the worst of the artifacts.
If you apply the Facet filter multiple times, your image takes on a kind of 
pointillist, stroked look that becomes obvious. Using the filter over and over 
on the same image can yield quite interesting special effects.

Smoothing with the Facet and Median Filters
The Median filter
The Median filter (look for it on the Filter➪Noise menu) operates similarly 
to the Facet filter in that it reduces the difference between adjacent pixels 
by changing the values of some of them. In this case, it assigns the median 
values of a group of pixels to the center pixel in the group. Unlike the Facet 
filter, the Median filter gives you a bit of control. You can choose the radius 
of the group that Photoshop uses to calculate the median value. Median 
tends to make an image look a bit blurrier because it reduces the contrast 
of adjacent pixels. However, it does a good job of smoothing the image and 
removing artifacts.
Creating an Angelic Glow
Sometimes, a little blur can add a soft, romantic mood or angelic glow that can improve 
glamour photos, pictures of kids, or even something as mundane as a ﬂ ower. The secret 
is to apply only enough blurring to provide the soft effect you want without completely 
obliterating your original subject. Assuming, of course, that your subject doesn’t deserve 
obliteration; that the kids are your own (or those of a close friend or relative); and that 
they are, in fact, of that rare angelic variety.
You don’t want to use this effect on other subjects, such as men, who generally like a 
rugged, masculine appearance. Many senior citizens regard the age lines on their faces 
as badges of distinction earned over a long, rewarding 
life. Don’t try softening them up with glowing effects, 
either.
To add an angelic glow to your little angel, just follow 
these steps:
 
1. Open the image in Photoshop.
 
 I used one of a cute little girl.
 
2. Choose Layer➪Duplicate Layer to create a copy 
of the image layer.

3. Select Filter➪Blur➪Gaussian Blur.
 
 Gaussian Blur softens the upper layer, 
producing an airy glow.
 
4. Move the Radius slider to the right to 
produce a moderate amount of blur 
and then click OK to apply the blurring 
effect, as shown in the ﬁ gure.
 
 I used a value of 7.
 
5. In the Layers panel, select Lighten 
from the Modes pop-up menu.
 
6. Use the Opacity slider (click the right-
pointing arrow to access the slider) to 
reduce the amount of glow (if it’s too 
much for your tastes).
 
 I reduced my Opacity to 65 percent.
 
7. Choose Layer➪Flatten Image to combine all the 
layers.
 
 Experiment with different amounts of Gaussian Blur 
until you ﬁ nd the perfect glowing effect, as I did in 
my ﬁ gure.
continued
Applying a Filter Again
You can reapply the last filter you worked with — using the same settings — 
by pressing Ctrl+F (Ô+F on the Mac). (It’s also the first command on the Filter 
menu.) You might want to do this to strengthen the effect of a filter on a par-
ticular image, layer, or selection. Or you simply may want to apply the same 
filter to a succession of images or selections.
To bring up the dialog box for the last filter you applied, press Ctrl+Alt+F 
(Windows) or Ô+Option+F (Mac). This shortcut can be very useful when you 
apply a filter and then decide you want to go back and use different settings. 
After applying the filter, press Ctrl+Z (Ô+Z on the Mac) to undo, and then 
press Ctrl+Alt+F (Ô+Option+F on the Mac) to bring up the filter’s dialog box. 
The dialog box opens with the settings you used last time, allowing you to 
make adjustments and then reapply the filter.

Selectively Applying a Filter
Fading a Filter
Sometimes, you may not want the full effects of a filter applied to your image 
or selection. Often, applying a filter full strength tends to give it that artificial 
“Photoshopped” look. Photoshop has a handy Fade Filter facility that lets 
you control the intensity of the filter’s effects. You can access this feature 
by choosing Edit➪Fade or by pressing Shift+Ctrl+F (Shift+Ô+F on the Mac). 
The Fade Filter facility also has a Preview option, so you can preview the 
changes you’re making to the original image.
 
You must fade your filter immediately after you use the filter. If you use a 
painting or editing tool after applying the filter, for example, Fade Filter 
doesn’t appear on the Edit menu anymore. Photoshop replaces it with Fade 
Brush Tool or whatever your last execution was.
You can fade the effect in the Fade dialog box in the following ways:
 
✓ Adjust opacity settings. Just about every filter allows you to adjust 
opacity, so most of the time, the Opacity slider is all you need to adjust 
the strength of the filter applied to your image.
 
✓ Use a blending mode. Use one of the blend modes in Photoshop to 
merge the filter effect with the original image. For more on blend modes, 
see Book V, Chapter 3.
 
 You can also fade a filter’s effect by applying a filter to a duplicate layer or 
to a selection on that layer. Then adjust the opacity or blend mode of the 
filtered layer so that it merges with the unfiltered layer underneath it.
 
You can also apply a Smart Filter to your layer or selection. By doing so, you 
get the utmost flexibility in editing the filter’s opacity and blend modes — 
not just once, but infinitely. For more about Smart Filters, see the section 
“Introducing Smart Filters,” earlier in this chapter.
Selectively Applying a Filter
You don’t need to apply filters to an entire image or an entire layer. You can 
achieve some of the best effects when you apply a filter to only a portion of 
an image — say, to an object in the foreground but not on the background. 
Your choices include the following:
 
✓ Selections: Make a selection and apply the filter only to that selection. 
You can use Quick Mask mode (see Book VI, Chapter 2) to paint a selec-
tion. This technique can give you a high degree of control; it even lets 
you feather the edges of the selection so the filter effect fades out.

520
Selectively Applying a Filter
 
✓ Channels: You can store selections as alpha channels (visible in the 
Channels panel, of course). But you can also choose to apply a filter to 
only one of the other channels, such as the Red, Green, or Blue channels 
in an RGB image. By using this technique, you can create a filter effect 
that’s applied to only one color in an image. (Check out Book VI, Chapter 
1 for information about channels.)
 
Because a Smart Filter comes equipped with its own layer mask, you can 
selectively apply the filter to your layer in varying percentages. For details, 
see the section “Introducing Smart Filters,” earlier in this chapter.
Putting It Together
Sprucing Up a Scanned Halftone
Publications use only a limited number of 
ink colors to reproduce a photograph. Every 
tone you see in a black-and-white image 
must be reproduced by using pure black 
ink and the white (okay, dirty beige) of the 
paper. Full-color images are represented 
by combining CMYK (cyan, magenta, yel-
low, and black). Printers can’t use various 
shades of gray ink to create grayscale pho-
tos. They also can’t use different strengths 
of color inks to generate the rainbow of 
hues you see in an image on-screen. To get 
at least some of that subtlety, photographs 
have to be converted to a pattern of dots 
before they can be printed.
Our eyes blend the dots together to produce the illusion of a grayscale or color image 
with smooth gradations of tone. However, a problem arises if you want to reuse a photo-
graph and don’t have access to the original. Scanners can capture the halftone dots, but 
the resulting image usually has an unpleasant pattern called moiré.
You have several ways of reducing the moiré effect, usually by blurring the image so that 
the dots merge and the underlying pattern vanishes. Many scanners have a descreen 
setting that partially eliminates the effect, but that setting sometimes actually blurs your 
image more than you want. Fortunately, you can usually do a pretty good job in Photo-
shop. But remember that, if there’s any way possible, scanning from continuous-tone 
images always yields the best quality.
In the following steps, I demonstrate an easier way to eliminate a moiré pattern (over the 
years, I managed to lose the original negative and print). You can see the dreadful moiré 
pattern that resulted when I scanned the clip.

521
Book VII
Chapter 1
Making Corrections 
with Daily Filters
Selectively Applying a Filter
To rid your scanned halftone print of bothersome moiré, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the image in Photoshop.
 
2. Zoom in so that you can see the halftone pattern clearly while you work, as shown 
in the ﬁ gure.
 
3. Choose Filter➪Blur➪Gaussian Blur.
 
 The Gaussian Blur dialog box appears.
 
 You can also ﬁ rst convert your image to a Smart Object and then apply your Gauss-
ian Blur and Smart Sharpen ﬁ lters as Smart Filters. See the section “Introducing 
Smart Filters,” in this chapter.
 
4. Move the Radius slider to the right until the halftone pattern is blurred and then 
click OK to apply the blur.
 
 I used a value of 1.7 pixels in my ﬁ gure.
 
5. Choose Filter➪Sharpen➪Smart 
Sharpen to restore some of the image’s 
sharpness now that you’ve eliminated 
the pattern. Choose Gaussian Blur for 
the Remove algorithm.
 
 As long as the Radius value for the 
Smart Sharpen ﬁ lter doesn’t exceed 
the radius of the Gaussian Blur that 
you ﬁ rst applied, the two ﬁ lters won’t 
cancel each other out. You want the 
sharpening to make the details of the 
image crisper without bringing back 
those blurred halftone dots.
 
6. Move the Amount slider to the right to sharpen the image.
 
 Try to ﬁ nd a setting that does the job 
without making the image appear 
unnaturally sharp or show too much 
contrast. I used 150 percent in my ﬁ gure.
 
 Calculate a starting Radius value by 
dividing the ppi (pixels per inch) of the 
scanned image by 150. If a moiré pattern 
reappears, reduce the Radius value.
 
7. Click OK to apply the sharpness.
 
 The result of my blur-and-sharpen exer-
cise is shown in the ﬁ nal ﬁ gure.

P
hotoshop has dozens of filters that let you enhance your 
image in unusual ways. You can create Old Masters 
portraits from common snapshots, shatter your image 
into a thousand sparkling pieces, create clouds in a 
cloudless sky, create stained glass, or perform hun-
dreds of other tricks.
The big challenge in using these filters is figuring 
out what each filter can do and how to apply it to 
the best effect. This chapter builds on Book VII, 
Chapter 1 by introducing you to more of those 
fabulous Photoshop plug-ins — and shows you 
some typical applications for them. Several Putting-
It-Together projects have step-by-step instructions. 
For the first few examples, I provide you with the set-
tings I used to achieve particular looks. However, filter 
effects vary greatly when applied to different images, so 
you have to play with the filter controls yourself when you use 
these techniques with your own images.
 
You can apply a filter to a layer, selection, or channel. And you can also fade 
a filter, change opacity settings, and use layer masks to soften the effects of 
filters. In fact, in some cases, you may have to decrease the effect of a filter 
because full strength can look overdone. On the other hand, when applied 
selectively, the same filter may look subtle and sophisticated. Although fil-
ters can be a blast to play with, you want to exercise some restraint when 
applying them for a real project. Getting carried away with the effects is 
easy, but the simplest effect is often the most beautiful.

Working in the Filter Gallery
Working in the Filter Gallery
The Filter Gallery (a dialog box-like gizmo that Adobe refers to as an editing 
window) gives you an alternative route to access and apply filters. To put it 
on-screen, choose Filter➪Filter Gallery. In this window, you can apply mul-
tiple filters, as well as edit or delete them later. This feature has made filters 
more flexible, more user-friendly, and easier to apply.
Follow these steps to get up and running in the Filter Gallery:
 
1. Choose Filter➪Filter Gallery.
 
 The Filter Gallery dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 2-1.
 
2. Click your desired filter category folder.
 
 The folder expands and displays the filters in that category. A thumbnail 
illustrating the filter’s effect accompanies each filter. To collapse the 
filter category folder, simply click it again.
 
3. Select the filter you want to apply.

4. Specify any settings associated with the filter.
 
 You get a large preview of your image in the left side of the dialog box. 
Use the magnification controls to zoom in and out of the preview. When 
you change your settings, the preview dynamically updates itself. To 
preview a different filter, simply select that filter.
 
 If you want your custom settings to be the new default for the filter, 
simply hold down the Ctrl key (Ô key on the Mac) while you are specify-
ing your settings. The Cancel button changes to Default. After you have 
established your settings, release the Ctrl (or Ô) key. Your new settings 
then become the new default. 
 
5. When you’re happy with the filter, click OK to apply the filter and exit 
the dialog box. But if you want to apply another filter, leave the dialog 
box open and proceed to Steps 6, 7, and 8.
 
6. If you want to apply another filter, click the New Effect Layer button 
at the bottom of the dialog box.
 
 Clicking this button duplicates the existing filter.
 
7. Select your new filter, which then replaces the duplicate.
 
 Photoshop lists each of the filters you apply to the image in the bottom-
right of the dialog box.
 
8. When you’re done, click OK to apply the second filter and exit the 
dialog box.
 
 You can apply as many filters as you want to your image. But, often, less 
is more.
Here are some other helpful tips to keep in mind when you’re using the Filter 
Gallery:
 
✓ To delete an applied filter, select it in the list in the lower right of the 
dialog box and click the Delete Effect Layer button (the trash can icon) 
at the bottom of the dialog box.
 
✓ To edit an applied filter’s settings, select it in the list and make any nec-
essary changes. Click OK to reapply. Although you can edit a particular 
filter’s settings, that edit affects any subsequent filters you’ve made after 
applying that particular filter.
 
✓ You can rearrange the order of the applied filters. Simply select and 
drag the filter up or down within the list.
 
 Rearranging the order of the applied filters changes the resulting effect 
of the filters.

526
Getting Artsy
 
✓ To resize the Filter Gallery dialog box, drag the lower-right corner.
 
✓ To hide the Filter menu and provide the maximum real estate for the 
preview box, click the arrow to the left of the OK button.
 
✓ You can choose any of the filters found in the Filter Gallery from the 
Filter menu itself. Choosing a Filter menu filter launches the Filter 
Gallery automatically — but not all filters are available in the Filter 
Gallery. You have to access some of them individually from the Filter 
menu.
 
Don’t be misled into thinking that the Filter Gallery is like layer styles, where 
the styles can be removed and the underlying pixel data is returned to its 
pristine, original state. Regular filters change the pixels of an image perma-
nently, and after you apply one, you can’t remove it. So, be sure that you 
really like what you’ve done and that you have a backup copy of that pre-
cious family photo or critical project image.
That being said, if you do want your filters to act like layer styles, they can. 
You can apply a Smart Filter to any layer that you first convert into a Smart 
Object. Smart Filters enable you to apply a filter non-destructively, with-
out altering any underlying pixels. For more on Smart Filters, see Book VII, 
Chapter 1.
Getting Artsy
Quite a few Photoshop filters produce artistic effects. You can find a large 
collection of them in the Sketch and Stylize submenus. However, the Artistic 
menu contains 15 versatile filters that you can use to add brush strokes to 
your images, wrap them in plastic, create poster-like effects, and manufac-
ture other interesting looks.
Many Photoshop users employ these 
filters to create images that look as if 
they were painted. What those users 
might not tell you, unless pressed, 
is that artsy filters can make terrible 
photos look better — or, in some 
cases, pretty darn good. These filters 
can disguise a multitude of photo-
graphic sins, turning shoebox rejects 
into pretty decent digital transforma-
tions. The photo of a clock in Figure 2-2 
is, arguably, not very interesting — and 
(worse) it’s blurry. I moved the camera 
while I was taking the photo.
Figure 2-2: This photo isn’t that interesting 
and is slightly out of focus.

Getting Artsy
To improve this image, I employed filters on the Filter➪Artistic menu. Try 
one of the following filters:
 
✓ Poster Edges: A quick application of this filter improves the photo 100 
percent. (See the left photo in Figure 2-3.) The filter not only gives the 
picture an artsy, poster-like look, it also enhances the edges to make the 
clock’s outline appear sharper.
 
 I set the Poster Edges filter’s Edge Thickness to 4, bumped the Edge 
Intensity up to a value of 6 to create dramatic-looking edges, and set the 
Posterization level to 6 to allow more tones for a bit more realism.
 
✓ Rough Pastels: This filter, shown in the right photo in Figure 2-3, gives 
the look of a fine art piece created with oil pastels. I used the settings of 
8 for the Stroke Length and Stroke Detail, 100% Scale, and 20 for Relief. I 
left my light source at Bottom.
Figure 2-3: The Poster Edges filter (left) and the Rough Pastels filter (right) help.
 
✓ The Dry Brush: This filter can add an even more stylistic effect, reduc-
ing details down to a series of broad strokes.
 
✓ Colored Pencil: This filter crosshatches the edges of your image to 
create a pencil-like effect.
 
✓ Cutout: This effect assembles an image from what looks like cut-out 
paper shapes, which resemble a kid’s art project.
 
✓ Film Grain: This photographic effect diffuses an image with thousands of 
tiny dots that simulate clumps of film grain. (Think of old home movies.)
 
✓ Fresco: This effect looks (supposedly) like pigments applied to fresh, 
wet plaster. Okay, I guess . . . if you squint.
 
✓ Paint Daubs: This effect uses smears of color from your choice of a half-
dozen different brush types. Very Jackson Pollock.

528
Stroking Your Image with Filters
 
✓ Plastic Wrap: This filter can produce a wet look, particularly when you 
apply it to a selection and then fade the filter so it doesn’t overpower 
the detail in your image.
 
✓ Watercolor: This nice pastel effect diffuses an image while adding an 
interesting, watery texture.
Stroking Your Image with Filters
You can find more stroking filters on the Brush Strokes submenu, along 
with some interesting texturizing filters that can spruce up less-than-perfect 
photos and add a new look to even your best shots.
Choose Filter➪Brush Strokes to find the stroking filters that can provide 
hours of fun, including
 
✓ Ink Outlines: Adobe describes this filter as producing the look of a cor-
roded ink drawing.
 
✓ Spatter: This filter generates the look you might get from a sputtering 
airbrush, as shown in Figure 2-4. I set my Spray Radius to 25 and my 
Smoothness to 10.
 
✓ Accented Edges: Use this filter to make a subject jump out from its back-
ground by emphasizing the edges of all the objects in the picture.

Creating Exotic Edges for Your Images
An attractive border can give your image 
an edge. If you want an edgy look or want 
to take your work right to the edge, you 
can apply this technique faster than you 
can say, “Overworked metaphor!” Pho-
toshop lets you apply deckled looks and 
other effects to the borders of your image 
by using any of several plug-ins built right 
into your trusty Filters menu.
Follow these easy steps to the edge of 
image immortality:
 
1. Choose a photo that you think could 
use a decorative border and open it 
in Photoshop.
 
2. With the Rectangular Marquee tool, 
select the portion of the image you’re 
framing, as shown in the ﬁ gure.
 
3. Double-click the Quick Mask Mode 
icon in the Tools panel. In the Quick 
Mask dialog box that appears, 
choose Selected Areas in the Color 
Indicates area.
 
4. Click OK to enter Quick Mask mode.
 
 Photoshop highlights the rectangle 
you selected in color, as shown in the 
ﬁ gure.
 
5. Choose Filter➪Blur➪Gaussian Blur, 
set the Radius, and click OK.
 
 To give the image a softer edge when the selection is deckled, I’ve set the Radius 
to 30.
 
6. Choose Filter➪Brush Strokes➪Sprayed Strokes.
 
7. Adjust the Stroke Length and Spray Radius sliders to acquire the desired effect.
 
 The higher the resolution, the higher the value you may need. In this case, I moved 
the Stroke Length and Spray Radius sliders to the max of 20 and 25 (respectively).

Distorting for Fun
Distorting for Fun
With a couple exceptions, Photoshop’s Distortion filters twist, turn, and 
bend your images in surprising ways, turning ordinary objects into wavy 
images, pinched shapes, and bloated spheres.
The first exception? The Diffuse Glow filter distorts images only to the extent 
that it imbues them with a soft, romantic, fuzzy look that can make the 
sharpest image look positively ethereal.
I’ve never figured out why Adobe dumped this useful filter into the Distort 
submenu, but there it is. (And here it is applied to a girl in Figure 2-5.)

8. Select your desired Stroke Direction 
from the drop-down list.
 
 I selected Right Diagonal for my

9. Click OK to apply the effect to the 
Quick Mask selection.
 
 After application, the edges of the 
quick mask overlay (highlighted area) 
appear frayed, as shown in the ﬁ gure.
 
10. Press Q to exit Quick Mask mode.
 
 A selection border with ragged edges 
appears around the selection.
 
11. Press Ctrl+C (Ô+C on the Mac) to 
copy the selected area, and then 
press Ctrl+V (Ô+V on the Mac) to 
paste it into a new layer.
 
12. Create a new layer and ﬁ ll it with the 
color you want for the background.
 
 I ﬁ lled my background with white.
 
13. In the Layers panel, move the 
background layer underneath your 
deckled image.
 
14. Choose Layer➪Flatten Image. When prompted, if you want to discard hidden lay-
ers, click OK.
 
 The ﬁ nished image appears, as shown in the ﬁ nal ﬁ gure.

Figure 2-5: Give your photo a heavenly aura with the Diffuse Glow filter (left).
The second exception is the Lens Correction filter, which fixes distor-
tions caused by the camera lens. In the dialog box, you can find settings 
to correct barrel and pincushion distortions, in which straight lines appear 
(respectively) bowed out or in. Select the Remove Distortion tool and drag 
on the image — or you can also drag the Remove Distortion slider. Use the 
Straighten tool to rotate a tilted image, as shown in Figure 2-6. You can also 
correct perspective issues by using the Transform sliders of Vertical and 
Horizontal Perspective. If your images suffer from vignetting (in which the 
edges are darker than the center), slide the Vignette sliders to correct the 
problem. Finally, got colored fringe around your subjects? Photographers 
call this nastiness chromatic aberration. Fringe, aberration, whatever it’s 
called — get rid of it by using the Red/Cyan or Blue/Yellow Fringe sliders. 
The Move Grid, Hand, and Zoom tools can help make your adjustments more 
user-friendly.

Pumping Up the Noise
The Glass filter can do the following to your images:
 
✓ Add a glass-block texture
 
✓ Add a canvas texture
 
✓ Create frosted-glass fuzziness
 
✓ Break up your image with tiny lenses
 
Don’t like any of Photoshop’s textures? No biggie; you can also load your 
own texture. Click the Texture pop-up menu (the right-pointing arrow) and 
select Load Texture.
Pumping Up the Noise
Noise in images consists of any graininess or texture that occurs, either 
because of the inherent quality of the image or through the editing process. 
Noise filters, such as the Photoshop Add Noise plug-in, produce random 
texture and grain in an image. If you’re new to image editing, you might 
wonder why you’d want to add noise to an image in the first place. Wouldn’t 
it be smarter to remove it? Well, sometimes. In practice, you can find a lot of 
applications that call for a little noise here and there:
 
✓ Adding texture: Objects that become too smooth, either because of 
blurring or other image editing you may have done, often look better 
when you add some noise to give them a texture. This technique is par-
ticularly useful if one object in an image has been edited, smoothed, or 
blurred more than the other objects in the image.
 
✓ Blending foreign objects into a scene: When you drop a new object into 
the middle of an existing scene, the amount of grain or noise in the new 
object is often quite different from the objects it’s joining.
 
 For example, say you’ve decided to take a photo of your house and 
want to insert a certain luxury car in your driveway. Unfortunately, your 
digital photo of your brother-in-law’s luxo-mobile is a lot sharper than 
the picture of your house. Adding a little noise can help the two objects 
blend more realistically. You may even forget that the car isn’t yours.
 
✓ Improving image quality: Images that contain smooth gradients often 
don’t print well because some printers can’t reproduce the subtle blend 
of colors from one hue to another. The result is objectionable banding in 
your printed image: You can see distinct stripes where the colors prog-
ress from one to another. Adding a little noise can break up the gradient 
enough that your printer can reproduce the blend of colors, and the 
noise/grain itself is virtually invisible on the printed sheet.

534
Pumping Down the Noise
Pumping Down the Noise
Although the Add Noise filter adds grain, the other filters in the Noise 
submenu don’t add noise at all; instead, they make noise and artifacts 
(flaws, such as the dust and scratches on old film) less noticeable. Choose 
Filter➪Noise to find your tools, which include
 
✓ Despeckle: This filter makes dust spots in your image less noticeable 
by decreasing the contrast of your entire image — except at the edges. 
That translates into a slightly blurry image (which masks the spots) that 
still retains sharpness along the edges of image components. You end 
up with a little blur to soften the image but enough detail in the edges 
that the picture still looks good.
 
✓ Dust & Scratches: This filter concentrates its blurring effect on only 
those areas of your image that contain scratches and other artifacts. 
Photoshop performs this magic by looking at each pixel in an image and 
moving out in a radial direction until it encounters an abrupt transition 
in tone. (That’s a signal that a spot or scratch has been found.) You can 
specify the radius in which Photoshop searches for the little culprits, 
from 1 to 100 pixels. Be careful not to overdo it. Too much of this filter 
can obliterate the detail in the image. Leave the Threshold at 0. If you 
journey into the world of mush, try using Edit➪Fade right after you 
apply the filter.
 
 When working with any of the Noise filters, be very conservative at first. 
All the Noise filters involve destruction of image data. Remember, that’s 
just the nature of filters, in general — changing pixel data. A little bit can 
help — and be just the effect you’re looking for. Just a little bit more, 
however, may completely wreck things.
 
✓ Median: This filter reduces contrast around dust motes, thus hiding 
them, in a slightly different way. This filter looks at the pixels surround-
ing each pixel in the image and replaces the center one with a new pixel 
that has the median brightness level of that group. The process is a little 
hard to describe succinctly; but basically, the bright spots darken while 
the rest of the image isn’t affected. For more on the Median filter, see 
Book VII, Chapter 1. 
 
✓ Reduce Noise: This filter, shown in Figure 2-8, is designed to remove 
luminance noise and JPEG artifacts that can appear on digital photos. 
Luminance noise is grayscale noise that makes images look overly 
grainy. Here’s some info on the options:
 
• Strength: Specify the amount of noise reduction. You can reduce 
noise in the overall image or (if you click the Advanced button) chan-
nel by channel.
 
 Be sure to check out the Blue channel, in particular. It’s often the 
channel that captures all the crud.

• Preserve Details: A higher number preserves edges and details but 
reduces the amount of noise removal. Find a happy medium.
 
• Reduce Color Noise: Removes random colored pixel artifacts.
 
• Sharpen Details: Counteracts the fact that removing noise reduces 
sharpness, as well.
 
• Remove JPEG Artifact: Check this option to remove the annoying 
blocks and halos that can occur because of low-quality JPEG 
compression.
 
 You can also save and reload your settings. Click the disk/arrow icon. 
In the New Filter Settings dialog box, enter a name for your settings

Breaking Your Image into Pieces
The Pixelate filters in Photoshop break up your images into bits and pieces, 
providing more of those painterly effects you can get with brush strokes and 
artistic filters.
The Pixelate submenu includes the Crystallize filter (applied to the little girl 
shown in Figure 2-9), as well as plug-ins that produce color halftone effects, 
fragmented images, and the pointillize effect (used in the “Creating Snow and 
Rain” Putting-It-Together project, in this chapter).

Rendering
In computerese, rendering means creating something from nothing, in a way. 
That’s why rendering filters in Photoshop all produce special effects by cre-
ating a look, object, or lighting effect that’s melded with your original image.
Using the Clouds filter
The Clouds filter can muster a sky full of clouds from scratch with a few 
clicks of the mouse, as in the now-cloudy picture shown in Figure 2-10. This 
filter creates clouds using random values from between the foreground 
and background colors. Indeed, most Photoshop veterans use this filter so 
much that they have a surprising number of clouds in their images. Find 
it at Filter➪Render➪Clouds. To create a more contrasty cloud effect, hold 
down Alt (Option on the Mac) quickly when choosing the command. If you 
don’t like the first set of clouds you get, apply the filter again and again until 
you do. If you want a more “realistic” sky, try using a dark sky blue for your 
foreground color and a very light blue, or white, color for your background 
color.

Creating fibers
This filter can create a textile-like effect out of thin air. Choose

slider to increase the contrast between light and dark areas. Move the 
Strength slider to increase the tightness of the weave of the fibers. Click the

Using other rendering filters
Other useful filters on the Render submenu (at Filter➪Render) include
 
✓ Difference Clouds: Use this filter to create puffy objects in the sky (or 
foggy clouds at lower levels). Instead of performing this magical feat the 
way the Clouds filter does, the Difference Clouds filter uses image infor-
mation to figure the difference in pixel values between the new clouds

Rendering
and the image they’re joining. The result is a unique cloud effect. Try 
applying the filter repeatedly to create a marbleized effect.
 
✓ Lens Flare: This filter creates the reflection effect that plagues photogra-
phers when they point their cameras toward a strong light source, such 
as the sun. Photoshop mimics several different kinds of photographic 
lenses, giving you useful flares that can spice up concert photos, add a 
sunset where none existed, and create other kinds of lighting bursts. In 
the Lens Flare dialog box, specify a location for the center of the flare by 
clicking the image thumbnail or dragging the crosshair.
 
✓ Lighting Effects: As a sort of photo-studio lighting setup, this filter uses 
pixels to do its work. You can set up 16 different lights and manipulate 
how they illuminate your photo.
 
✓ Texture Fill: This filter fills an area with a grayscale image. Select the 
filter and open the image you want to use as the texture fill.
Putting It Together
Creating Snow and Rain
Sometimes, you may come across a photo that needs a little bit of atmosphere thrown in 
to give it extra punch. And I mean atmosphere literally. By using a couple of ﬁ lters and 
a blend mode, you can add some rain or snow to any image. Just follow these steps to 
create either rain or snow:
 
1. Open a color image. If it isn’t 
currently in RGB mode, choose 
Image➪Mode➪RGB Color.
 
 Make sure you’re in RGB mode; the 
blend mode used in these steps 
doesn’t work correctly with CMYK 
images.
 
2. Drag the background layer to the 
Create a New Layer icon at the 
bottom of the Layers panel.
 
 You now see a layer named Back-
ground Copy in the Layers panel.
 
3. Double-click the name Background Copy and type Snow.
 
 This isn’t a mandatory step. I’m just being ultra-organized.
 
4. First, set your background color to white. With the Snow layer active, choose 
Filter➪Pixelate➪Pointillize. In the dialog box, set your cell size to whatever value 
you prefer. Click OK.
 
 The bigger the cell size, the bigger the snowﬂ akes or raindrops.

 For rain, you might try a cell size of 3 
(which is the minimum) or 4. For 
snow, try a larger cell size, between 6 
and 9. I used a value of 7 in my image.
 
5. On the Snow layer, choose 
Image➪Adjustments➪Threshold. 
Move the slider all the way to the 
right, to a max value of 255.
 
 This adjustment takes the colored 
cells and turns them to either black or 
white.
 
 By using a value of 255, all brightness values less than 255 turn black, and the 
remaining value turns white.
 
6. On the Snow layer, select Screen from the Mode pop-up menu in the Layers panel.
 
 The Screen blend mode lightens 
the Snow layer, where it mixes 
with the background. Blending 
with black pixels has no effect; 
therefore, they drop out, as shown 
in the ﬁ gure.
 
7. Choose Filter➪Blur➪Motion 
Blur. In the dialog box that opens, 
specify the Angle and Distance 
values.
 
 If you want the wind to appear to be 
blowing hard, set the angle more di-
agonally, around 45 degrees. If you 
want the weather to appear to be 
coming straight down, set the angle 
to 90 degrees. Setting the distance 
elongates the pointillized cells that 
you created in Step 4, making them 
look a little more realistic. For snow, 
start with a range of about 8 to 12 
pixels. For rain, start a little higher, 
around 15 to 25 pixels. I used a 
value of 12 pixels in my ﬁ gure.
 
 If you’re creating rain, proceed to 
Step 8. If you’re a snow person, 
you’re done, as shown in the pre-
ceding ﬁ gure.

8. Choose Filter➪Sharpen➪Unsharp Mask.
 
 The Unsharp Mask dialog box appears.
 
9. Specify the Amount, Radius, and Threshold values and click OK.
 
 The Unsharp Mask ﬁ lter gives the illusion of sharpening the focus of the image by 
increasing the contrast between the pixels.
 
 I used an amount of 500%, a Radius of 1, and kept the Threshold at 0. This gives the 
raindrops a little more deﬁ nition.
 
10. Choose Filter➪Blur➪Motion Blur. In the dialog box that appears, specify the Angle 
and Distance values.
 
 Again, the angle is up to you, but 
make it consistent with the value that 
you used in Step 7. Set the distance 
according to how you want your rain 
to appear — a moderate spring rain 
or a torrential, close-to-hurricane 
type of downpour. In the image 
shown here, I used 45 degrees and 25 
pixels.
Getting Organic with the Sketch Filters
The Sketch filter menu contains a few filters that don’t really belong there. 
That’s because many current Photoshop filters were acquired from Aldus 
Corporation (now defunct), and Adobe had to shoehorn them into the orga-
nizational structure of Photoshop. But no matter — they work nonetheless.
If you were to encounter a picture of Michelangelo’s David, shown in Figure 
2-11, you might be tempted to sketch the famous sculpture by using one of 
the filters you can find when you choose Filter➪Sketch.
Perhaps a Conté Crayon effect or a Graphic Pen and Ink look would be nice. 
But the Sketch submenu also includes other artistic effects, such as the Note 
Paper look, a halftone screen, chalk and charcoal, and even a bas-relief effect 
that turns flat images into a Michelangelo-esque sculpture.

You can also experiment with these other Sketch filters:
 
✓ Chrome: Creates a polished chrome effect. Use the Levels adjustment to 
add more contrast, if necessary.
 
✓ Photocopy: Gives that infamous, anachronistic look (dating back to 
the days when photocopiers didn’t do a very good job of reproducing 
halftone images). Creates areas of black and white with little gray value 
when the default foreground and background colors of black and white 
are selected.

542
Getting Organic with the Sketch Filters
 
✓ Plaster: Creates a look that resembles molten plastic more than it looks 
like plaster. The filter uses the foreground and background values to 
color the image.
 
✓ Stamp: Mimics a rubber or wooden-block stamp (not very sketch-like, 
indeed!).
 
✓ Reticulation: Adds texture by reproducing a veritable photographic 
disaster — the wrinkling of film emulsion that occurs when you move film 
from one developing chemical to another that has an extremely different 
temperature (think hot developer followed by a bath in cold water). The 
highlights look grainy; the shadow areas look thick and goopy.
 
✓ Torn Edges: Creates the look of ragged paper and colorizes the image, 
using the foreground and background colors.
 
✓ Water Paper: Creates the look of paint-like daubs on fibrous wet paper.
Even if the Sketch filters don’t all produce sketchy effects, they do have one 
thing in common: They give your images an organic look that’s decidedly 
uncomputer-like.

Adding Water Droplets and Other Wet Effects
 
You can ﬁ nd a lot of techniques for creating nice, neat, round drops of water by using 
Photoshop. Unless you’ve just waxed your car and expect a rain shower within moments, 
however, perfectly beaded water droplets can be fairly rare. In real life, you’re likely to 
encounter some sloppy drops and driblets. This technique simulates that look. You could 
use it to add sparkling water drops to a ﬂ ower, create a wet-look texture for artistic 
effect, or add a three-dimensional trompe l’oeil (“fools the eye”) optical illusion. Find the 
ﬂ ower image I use on this book’s companion Web site if you want to follow along. Follow 
these steps to add wet effects:
 
1. Open a plain old bone-dry photograph in 
Photoshop.
 
 I’m using a ﬂ ower photograph, which will look 
great wet.
 
2. Press D to make sure you have the foreground and 
background colors in Photoshop set to the default 
values of black and white.
 
3. Choose Window➪Channels. Choose New 
Channel from the Channels panel menu.
 
 This choice creates a new alpha channel for the water droplets. (For more on chan-
nels, see Book VI.)

4. In the Color Indicates area of the New Channel 
dialog box, select the Selected Areas radio button 
and set Opacity to 100%. Click OK.
 
5. Select Filter➪Render➪Clouds to create a motley 
cloud effect to use as the basis for your random 
water droplets.
 
 To view your alpha channel, select it in the Channels 
panel.
 
6. Choose Image➪Adjustments➪Threshold, and then 
move the slider to create black blotches that will 
become water droplets, as shown in the ﬁ gure. 
Click OK.
 
 I used a value of 83, but because the Clouds ﬁ lter 
produces random results, you may ﬁ nd that a 
different value works better for you.
 
7. Choose Filter➪Blur➪Gaussian Blur and move the 
Radius slider enough to blur the jagged edges of the 
droplets. Click OK.
 
 I used a value of 3.8 pixels.
 
8. Choose Filter➪Sharpen➪Unsharp Mask and adjust 
the Amount and Radius sliders to ﬁ rm up the edges 
of the droplets. Click OK.
 
 I found that an Amount of 85% and a Radius of about 
46 creates soft-edged-but-distinct 
water droplets, as shown in the ﬁ gure.
 
9. Ctrl-click (Ô-click on the Mac) the 
new channel in the Channels panel to 
load the selection you’ve created, as 
shown in the ﬁ gure.

nels panel to return to your full-color

Patchwork filter.

 The bevel/embossing effect adds a 
third dimension to the drops. You can

controls to get the exact effect you 
want. I used the Inner Bevel style, 
set to the Smooth Technique in the 
Structure area of the dialog box. I used 
the sliders to increase the Size of the 
bevel to 27 pixels and Softened the 
edges by 11 pixels.

You can find other filters on this menu to help you create mosaic effects, 
add yet another kind of film grain, and create stained-glass effects in your 
images. But the most versatile filter in this set is the Texturizer, shown in 
Figure 2-13. The Texturizer filter enables you to apply various kinds of tex-
tures to your images or selections, including Canvas, Sandstone, Burlap, or 
Brick.

You can select the relative size of the texture compared to the rest of your 
image by using the Scaling slider, and adjust the amount of 3-D relief effect. 
You can even select the direction of the light source that produces the 3-D 
look, selecting from top, bottom, either side, or any of the four corners of 
the image. If those variations aren’t enough for you, then create your own 
texture, save it as a Photoshop PSD file, and use that file to texturize your 
image.
 
You can find a handful of other filters that allow you to load your own tex-
tures, including Rough Pastels, Underpainting, and Conté Crayon.

Looking at the Other Filters
Looking at the Other Filters
The Video and Other categories are the homes of the oddest of the odd. For 
example, the Other submenu is home to the Custom filter, which is no filter 
at all — it’s a dialog box that has a matrix in which you can type numbers 
that Photoshop uses to process the pixels in your image in unexpected 
ways. The center box in the matrix represents a pixel in your image; the sur-
rounding boxes represent the pixels that surround that pixel. The numbers 
you type tell Photoshop whether to darken or lighten pixels. You can experi-
ment to see what will happen, and, if you like the effect, tell all your friends 
that you meant to do that.
The High Pass filter, also in the Other category, applies an effect opposite to 
the Gaussian Blur filter. It finds and keeps the details in the edges where it 
finds distinct color or tonal differences and turns the rest of the image gray. 
When converting a continuous-tone image into a bitmap (black and white 
only) image, applying this filter is useful before applying the Threshold 
adjustment. See Book VIII, Chapter 1 for more on the Threshold command. 
The High Pass filter is also handy for creating a channel mask. (See Book VI, 
Chapter 3 for details.)
Two other filters that help with masking are the Minimum and Maximum 
filters. The Minimum filter expands the black areas while decreasing 
white areas (a process known as choking in traditional photography). The 
Maximum filter expands the white portions while decreasing black areas 
(known as spreading). The radius value you enter tells the filter how many 
pixels to expand or decrease from the edges of your selection.
The Video menu contains its own share of strange filters, including the NTSC 
Colors filter, which performs the rather obscure function of converting all 
the colors in your image to match the colors used for television reproduc-
tion. (NTSC stands for National Television Systems Committee.) You can use 
this filter to process digital presentations or slides that you want to show 
on television, if you’re really, really particular about how the colors are 
portrayed.

iquify is the only Photoshop filter that gets a chapter of its own. But, 
then again, Liquify is no ordinary filter; it’s the ultimate in image distor-
tion tools and therefore is a good deal more complex than most of 
its kin on the Filter menu. What other filter has its own hefty 
tools panel, loads of buttons, several different modes, and 
more than a dozen option categories that amount to 
dozens more variations?
The Liquify command lets you push and pull on 
parts of your image; twist, turn, and pinch other 
parts; bloat sections; freeze portions in place 
so that they remain immune to the transforma-
tions going on around them; and perform selec-
tive reconstructions if you don’t like everything 
you’ve done. You can perform this magic with a 
remarkable degree of control, too.
This chapter explores all the features of the Liquify 
command and shows you how to use these features to 
create sensational images.
Exploring the Liquify Window
At first glance, the Liquify window is a little daunting. It’s a little daunting on 
second, third, and fourth glances, too. But when you quit glancing and dive 
into this versatile filter, you’ll find that the tools and options make a lot of 
sense.

548
Exploring the Liquify Window
You open the Liquify window by choosing Filter➪Liquify, and there, the 
Liquify Tools panel appears on the left, as shown in Figure 3-1. The other 
options available with Liquify (which I describe in the section appropriately 
named “The Options Areas,” later in this chapter) appear on the right side 
of the window. The Tools panel includes a dozen tools that you can use to 
paint and distort your image.
 
Like with Photoshop’s main Tools panel, you can activate each tool by press-
ing a letter associated with its name.

in this list with their keyboard shortcuts in parentheses, the painting tools 
(refer to Figure 3-1) are

Book VII
Chapter 3
Distorting with the 
Liquify Command
Exploring the Liquify Window
 
 ✓ Forward Warp (W): This tool is faintly 
reminiscent of the Smudge tool, but it doesn’t blur 
the pixels quite as much as it pushes them forward 
while you drag, creating a stretched effect. Use the 
Warp tool to push pixels where you want them to go, 
using short strokes or long pushes.
 
 When compared to a tool like the Smudge tool, which 
tends to destroy detail, the Warp tool can preserve 
detail within distortions.
 
 ✓ Twirl Clockwise (C): Place the cursor in one spot, 
press the mouse button, and watch the pixels under 
your brush rotate like a satellite photo of a tropical 
storm. Or drag the cursor to create a moving twirl 
effect. Pixels move faster in the center than along the 
edges of the brush. To twirl the other way, hold 
down the Alt (Option on the Mac) key while you drag 
or hold down the mouse button.
 
 Try this technique with the other tools I describe in this list (with some 
tools, the effect is more obvious than with others). Simply hold down 
the mouse button. The longer you hold down the mouse button, the 
more prominent the effect becomes.
 
 ✓ Pucker (S): This tool is the equivalent of the Pinch 
filter, squishing pixels toward the center of the area 
covered by the brush while you hold down the mouse 
button or drag. To reverse the pucker direction, which 
essentially applies a bloat, hold down the Alt (Option 
on the Mac) key while you hold down the mouse 
button or drag.
 
 ✓ Bloat (B): Here is an analog to the Spherize filter, 
pushing pixels toward the edge of the brush area while 
you hold down the mouse button or drag the mouse. 
To reverse the bloat direction — doing so applies a 
pucker — hold down the Alt (Option on the Mac) key 
while you hold down the mouse button or drag.

 ✓ Push Left (O): Formerly known as the Shift Pixels 
tool, this odd tool moves pixels to the left when you 
drag the tool straight up. Drag down to move pixels 
to the right. Drag clockwise to increase the size of 
the object being distorted. Drag counterclockwise to 
decrease the size. To reverse any of the directions, 
hold down the Alt (Option on the Mac) key while you 
hold down the mouse button or drag.
 
 ✓ Mirror (M): Formerly known as the Reflect tool, 
the Mirror tool drags a reversed image of your 
pixels at a 90-degree angle to the motion of the 
brush. Hold down the Alt key (Option key on the 
Mac) to force the reflection in the direction opposite 
the motion of the brush (for example, to the left of a 
brush moving right, or above a brush moving down). 
This tool is a good choice for producing shimmery 
reflections.
 
 ✓ Turbulence (T): This tool adds a random jumbling 
effect to your pixels when you click and hold down 
your mouse. It acts similarly to the Forward Warp tool 
when you click and drag. You can use the Turbulence 
tool to re-create maelstroms of air, fire, and water 
with (well, yeah) clouds, flames, and waves.
The other tools
The remaining tools in the Liquify Tools panel (refer to Figure 3-1) are
 
 ✓ Reconstruct (R): This tool lets you reverse or alter — completely or par-
tially — the distortions you’ve made. You can retrace your steps if you 
went overboard in your warping activities.
 
 ✓ Freeze Mask (F): Use this tool to protect areas from changes. It paints 
the frozen area with a red overlay, just like Quick Mask mode.
 
 ✓ Thaw Mask (D): This tool unprotects areas by erasing the red protective 
“freeze” tone. This is a lot like erasing areas you’ve painted in Quick 
Mask mode.
 
 ✓ Hand (H): The Hand tool works exactly like the standard Photoshop 
Hand tool. Click and drag the image to move it around within the 
Preview window. You can find more about the Hand tool in Book I, 
Chapter 4.
 
 ✓ Zoom (Z): The Zoom tool works exactly like the standard Photoshop 
Zoom tool. Indeed, you can also zoom in and out by using the Ctrl+ the 
plus sign (Ô+ the plus sign on the Mac) and Ctrl+ the minus sign (Ô+ the 
minus sign on the Mac) shortcuts. See Book I, Chapter 4, for more on 
using the regulation Zoom tool.

The Options Areas
Separate from the Liquify Tools panel and in the lower-left corner of the 
Liquify window is a magnification box with a pop-up menu that you can use 
to select magnifications from 6 percent to 1600 percent. Or, if you like but-
tons, click your way to magnification by using the +/– zoom control buttons.
The Options Areas
On the right side of the Liquify window (refer to Figure 3-1), you can find 
some menus and buttons that let you specify options for the tools, for recon-
structing and freezing, and for viewing. I point them all out to you here and 
cover exactly how to use them in the rest of this chapter:
 
✓ Load Mesh and Save Mesh: Liquify lets you show or hide a crisscross 
area called a mesh, shown in Figure 3-2. The mesh provides a visual map 
of the distortions you’ve applied. The mesh starts out as a square grid 
and changes while you apply distortions. The mesh lets you clearly see 
exactly what you’ve done to the image and, even better, provides a way 
to save those distortions on your hard drive so that you can load and 
reapply them to the same (or a different) image later.
 
✓ Tool Options: You can use the Tool Options area to apply parameters to 
the painting tools. You can specify the following options:
 
• Brush Size: Specifies the width of the brush.
 
• Brush Density: Specifies how fast the brush effect levels off at its 
edges. For example, with a feathered brush, the effect is stronger in 
the center and lighter at the edges.
 
• Brush Pressure: Specifies the speed at which you distort while you 
drag. Lower is slower.
 
• Brush Rate: Specifies the speed at which you distort while you keep 
a tool, such as the Twirl tool, stationary. Again, lower is slower.
 
• Turbulent Jitter: Determines how tightly the brush jumbles pixels. 
When using the Turbulence tool, this option gives the stroke a more 
natural, organic look.
 
 When you select the Reconstruct tool, you can also select a Reconstruct 
mode from the pop-up menu. (I explain each of these modes in the sec-
tion “Extending and Cloning Distortions,” later in this chapter.)
 
 If you have a pressure-sensitive stylus tablet, you can also choose to use 
the amount of pressure you apply to control the width of your brush 
stroke.

552
The Options Areas

Figure 3-2: The mesh provides a visual map of your applied distortions.
 
✓ Reconstruct Options: Here, you can select one of several Reconstruct 
modes. Reconstruct and Restore All buttons let you reverse all changes 
made on unfrozen areas (a little at a time) or revert to your last set 
of distortions. I show you how to use these options in the section 
“Reconstructing an Image,” later in this chapter.
 
✓ Mask Options: Consider freezing and masking one and the same when 
you’re immersed in the Liquify dialog box. The mask options let you 
freeze areas from existing selections, layer masks, transparent areas, or 
alpha channels in your image. You can also invert the frozen area (thaw-
ing frozen portions of the image and freezing the previously thawed 
areas), and thaw all the areas that were frozen with one click. Here’s the 
lowdown on the options, each of which is indicated by a double-circle 
icon:
 
• Replace Selection: Allows you to freeze or mask areas of your image 
based on an existing selection, transparent area, alpha channel, or 
layer mask. (For more on alpha channels and layer masks, see Book 
VI, Chapters 1 and 3, respectively.)

• Add to Selection: Displays the mask in the image and then enables 
you to add to the frozen areas by using the Freeze tool. Adds pixels 
to the currently frozen areas.
 
• Subtract from Selection: Subtracts pixels from the currently frozen 
areas.
 
• Intersect with Selection: Masks only those pixels that are selected 
and currently frozen.
 
• Invert Selection: Inverts selected pixels and currently frozen areas.
 
 Click None to remove frozen areas. Click Mask All to freeze the entire 
image. Click Invert All to exchange frozen and thawed areas.
 
✓ View Options: You can show or hide frozen (masked) areas, the mesh, 
or the image. Also, if you select the Show Mesh option, you can select 
the mesh size and color. If you select the Show Mask option, you can 
select the color that indicates frozen areas. For example, if your image 
contains a lot of red, you may want to change the freeze color to blue to 
create more contrast.
Finally, you can also apply a backdrop that shows how the image being 
liquified will appear when merged with other layers. To view your distorted 
image along with other layers, select the Show Backdrop option and then 
select the particular layer you want to view, or select All Layers from the Use 
pop-up menu. You can now choose whether you want the backdrop in front, 
behind, or blended with the distorted image. Specify an opacity percentage 
for the displayed layers so they won’t obliterate the image being distorted. 
The default (50 percent) allows you to see both your image and layers well 
so that you can keep track of your distortions.
Transforming an Image
Liquify seems impossibly complex on the surface, but it’s as easy to apply 
as finger paint after you play with it a little. Here’s a step-by-step scenario of 
the things you might do to apply some distortion to your own image:
 
1. Select and open an image you want to transmogrify with Liquify; 
select a layer.
 
2. If you don’t want to distort the whole layer, you can make your 
desired selection.
 
 You can also use a layer mask, alpha channel, selection, or transparent 
area to define what portions you want to distort.
 
3. Choose Filter➪Liquify.
 
 The Liquify dialog box appears.

554
Transforming an Image
 
4. If applicable, load your selection, layer mask, transparent area, or 
alpha channel into the Mask Options area.
 
 Make sure you select the Show Mask option in the View Options area. If you 
have a saved selection (also known as an alpha channel), you have an alpha 
channel option to choose from. Otherwise, you don’t see that option.
 
5. You can also select the Freeze Mask tool and paint over the areas that 
you want to mask or protect.
 
 After you freeze an area, you may want to get rid of the freeze highlight-
ing for a while. Deselect the Show Mask option in View Options to turn 
the display off.
 
6. In the View Options area, make sure that the Show Mesh and Show 
Image options are both selected.
 
 You can hide any or all of these at any time to get a different view of 
your image. For example, you might want to hide the frozen areas and 
mesh to view only your image with the distortions you’ve applied so far. 
Or you might want to look only at the mesh, as shown in Figure 3-3, to 
get a look at the distortions by themselves. Being able to examine the 
liquification process in several different ways is one reason that Liquify 
is so controllable.

distortions are mapped.

7. If you’re having trouble seeing the mesh (or think the mask color will 
blend in with a dominant color in your image), use the View options 
to change the size and color of the mesh and the hue of the mask.
 
 If you want to see your image distortions against a backdrop, you can 
select that option, as well.
 
8. Use the painting tools to apply various effects to your image, as shown 
in Figure 3-4.
 
 Remember to adjust the brush size and pressure to get the exact cover-
age you want.
 
 At various points while you work, you may decide you want to freeze 
parts of the image from further changes (either temporarily or 
permanently).

9. If you decide you want to work on an area again, select the Show 
Mask option to display the frozen areas (if necessary). Then select the 
Thaw Mask tool and erase all or part of the freeze.

10. Use the Reconstruct tool or options to partially or fully reverse or 
modify your distortions.
 
 If you want to start over, click Restore All to get back to your original 
image. All option settings stay as is. Hold down the Alt (Option on the 
Mac) key and click Reset to revert back to your original image and reset 
all options to their default settings.
 
11. When you finish, save the mesh you created by clicking Save Mesh. 
Give the mesh a name and store it on your hard drive.
 
 This step is totally optional, but saving your work is a good idea if you 
really like what you’ve done.
 
12. Apply the distortion to your image by clicking OK and exiting the 
Liquify dialog box.
Mastering Freezing and Thawing
Liquify’s ability to protect areas by freezing, and unprotect areas by thawing, 
deserves a closer look. Consider freezing the equivalent to masking. Here’s a 
summary of the things you need to know:
 
✓ The easiest way to freeze/
unfreeze is to use the Freeze 
Mask and Thaw Mask tools to 
paint the areas you want to 
protect or unprotect, as shown 
in Figure 3-5. Use the brush con-
trols to modify how either tool 
paints or erases. When you set 
brush pressure to less than 100 
percent, the opacity of the mask 
you’re painting determines how 
frozen that area is. For example, if 
an area is only 25-percent frozen, 
using a distortion tool on that 
area produces only three-quar-
ters the distortion you get in an 
area that’s completely thawed.
 
✓ You can use active or saved 
selections to define a frozen 
or masked area. This is a great 
capability; you can use all the 
selection tools in Photoshop to 
define frozen/unfrozen areas 
before you invoke Liquify. You 
can, for example, select a por-
tion of your image by using the 
Purestock
Figure 3-5: Protect areas from distortion by 
freezing them.

Magic Wand or Quick Selection tool, another portion by using Quick 
Mask mode, and then save them all (choose Selection➪Save Selection) 
as alpha channels. Then, when you use Liquify, choose any of those 
saved selections, or alpha channels, to freeze an area.
 
✓ Select the basis that you want to use for your mask from the pop-up 
menu of the Replace Selection command (the far-left icon under Mask 
Options).
 
 You can also select a layer mask to define your mask. This is a great 
way to apply your distortions at varying degrees of intensity. Where the 
mask reveals more, the distortion is more prominent. Where the mask 
hides more, the distortion is subtler. For details on layer masks, see 
Book VI, Chapter 3.
 
✓ To thaw all frozen areas, click the None button in the Mask Options 
area.
 
✓ To freeze all thawed areas, click the Mask All button in the Mask 
Options area.
 
✓ To reverse your frozen/unfrozen areas, click the Invert All button. 
That which was frozen is thawed, and that which was unfrozen is frozen. 
Amen!
Reconstructing an Image
One of the most powerful capabilities of Liquify is that it can reconstruct 
your image fully or partially — restoring some or all of the image to its pre-
Liquify state. This capability gives you a great deal of control over exactly 
how Photoshop transforms your image; you can backtrack any part of the 
transformation exactly the way you want. Here are some of your options:
 
✓ To cancel all the changes made on your image (say, you really, really 
messed up), click the Restore All button in the Reconstruct Options 
area. The image returns to its original state (as it was when you first 
opened the Liquify window) and removes distortions in both frozen and 
unfrozen areas.
 
✓ To change only unfrozen areas of your image to their original states, 
select the Revert mode in the Reconstruct Options area of the dialog 
box, and then click the Reconstruct button multiple times until you 
get to your desired image. The frozen areas remain distorted, but every-
thing else returns to normal.
 
 Use this option when you’re displeased with some sections but like the 
distortions in others. Freeze the stuff you like and let Liquify cancel the 
changes elsewhere.
 
✓ To paint portions of your image back to normalcy, select Revert mode 
in the Tool Options area, and then select the Reconstruct tool from 
the Liquify Tools panel. You can use the Reconstruct tool to restore the 

558
Extending and Cloning Distortions
areas that you paint. The image reverts more quickly at the center of the 
brush, so you have an extremely fine degree of control in how you revert 
your image. The mesh may help you see exactly what portions are being 
restored, too.
 
✓ You can also click the Reconstruct button to have Photoshop apply an 
overall reconstruction. Click the button to make Photoshop reconstruct 
once. Click it again to remove even more distortion.
 
 If you don’t necessarily want to reconstruct your image back to its origi-
nal condition, but rather want to alter, extend, or clone your distortions, 
you can select Reconstruct modes other than Revert. See the following 
section, which talks about the other Reconstruct modes.
Extending and Cloning Distortions
Liquify allows you to extend distortions you’ve made in frozen areas into 
parts of the image that are unfrozen. If you have an image that has the req-
uisite frozen and unfrozen portions, first select a mode — which determines 
specific ways in which Photoshop extends the image from the frozen areas 
into the unfrozen area.
Reconstruct modes
The Reconstruct modes include the following four:
 
✓ Rigid: This mode keeps rigid right angles in the mesh’s grid, which can 
generate some mismatches (Adobe calls these discontinuities) at the 
edges where the frozen and unfrozen portions meet. This mode restores 
unfrozen areas to close approximations of their original states.
 
✓ Stiff: Adobe describes this as a weak magnetic field, attracting the edges 
between the frozen and unfrozen 
areas strongly where they meet 
and producing less distortion in 
unfrozen areas farther away from 
the edges.
 
✓ Smooth: This mode smoothly 
spreads the frozen areas’ distor-
tions through the unfrozen areas. 
It produces a smooth blending 
effect, as shown in Figure 3-6.
 
✓ Loose: This mode generates an 
even smoother blending effect 
between frozen and unfrozen 
areas than the Smooth mode.

Distorting with the

Extending and Cloning Distortions
Use the Reconstruct tool to expand the frozen-area distortions into the 
unfrozen area, using the mode you’ve selected to blend the pixels while you 
paint. You can drag to paint, or click and Shift-click to paint in straight lines 
(much like you do with Photoshop’s regular Brush tools).
More Reconstruct modes
There are three Reconstruct modes that work slightly differently than the 
four discussed in the preceding section. These modes more or less clone 
particular distortions you’ve already applied elsewhere in the image. Like 
the Clone Stamp tool, these modes allow you to select part of the distortion 
and apply (or clone) copies of the selection to other parts of your image:
 
✓ Displace: Displace copies the amount of displacement at the starting 
point of the distortion to unfrozen parts of your image. You can use this 
mode to displace parts of your image to a different position in the image.
 
✓ Amplitwist: Amplitwist applies the displacement, scaling (sizing up or 
down), and rotation of the distortion to unfrozen areas to match those 
that exist at the starting point.
 
✓ Affine: Affine does much the same thing as Amplitwist, using displace-
ment, scaling, rotation, and skew in the distortion to modify unfrozen 
areas to match those distortions that exist at the starting point.
 
Each time you click the mouse button, you create a new starting point, so if 
you’re trying to extend a distortion effect from a single starting point, don’t 
release your mouse button until you’re done using the Reconstruct tool.
Using Displace, Amplitwist, and Affine
The Displace, Amplitwist, and Affine Reconstruct modes use different com-
binations of distortion factors — such as displacement, scaling, rotation, 
or skew. Unlike the other modes, the Reconstruct button isn’t available for 
these three. You can use these modes only with the Reconstruct tool. To use 
Displace, Amplitwist, or Affine, follow these steps:
 
1. Open an image to work on and choose Filter➪Liquify.
 
2. Select the Reconstruct tool.
 
3. Select one of the three modes — Displace, Amplitwist, or Affine — 
from the Reconstruct Mode pop-up menu in the Tool Options area.
 
4. Click a place in the image where you want to clone the applied 
distortion.
 
5. Drag with the mouse in the unfrozen areas to apply that distortion.

Extending and Cloning Distortions
 
6. To change the origin of the distortions being copied, click again any-
where in a distorted area to select a new sampling point. Then resume 
dragging in unfrozen areas.
 
 Your image takes on a distorted appearance, like the one shown in 
Figure 3-7.
 
7. When you finish, click OK to apply the distortion.

lthough taking the perfect photo is a great goal, 
it’s one that is often just beyond our reach. Not 
to worry though, if you’re a Photoshop owner. In this 
book, you find out what you need to know about 
correcting color in all its permutations — contrast, 
saturation, replacing, remapping, and so on. You find 
details on using the focus and toning tools to manu-
ally adjust the tones, textures, and colors in your 
images. I also give you details on how you can give 
your images a digital spa day with the two Healing 
Brushes and the Patch and Red Eye tools. You learn 
how to remove blemishes, wrinkles, and every other 
one of nature’s imperfections. After you master these 
techniques, you’ll be on your way to doing your own 
digital extreme makeovers. But whatever you do, 
don’t leave this book without checking out the 
Vanishing Point feature. This single command alone 
may be well worth the money you plunked down for 
Photoshop.

P
hotoshop can provide magical transformations to images, making 
them unrecognizable from the original. But sometimes what you really 
want is simply to make an image look the same as the original — only better. 
Perhaps the colors are a little too warm, or the shadows a bit inky, but you 
don’t want an image that looks more processed than a freeze-
dried floral arrangement. You’d be happy to have everyone 
admire your image without a clue that you’ve made 
major corrections in Photoshop.
Welcome to the world of image enhancements. 
This chapter concentrates on the things you can 
do to correct color, contrast, hue, and color 
saturation. After you master the basic tools, 
you can explore some even more sophisticated 
things that you can do by using features such 
as Photoshop’s Adjustment Layers (in Book V, 
Chapter 1), which let you dynamically apply your 
changes in remarkably flexible ways. But before 
you dive into image adjustments, make sure you 
remove any flaws, such as dust, scratches, blemishes, 
and other nasty items, from your image. Check out 
Book VIII, Chapter 3 to find out about fixing imperfections.
Introducing the Histogram Panel
One of the first things you want to do before you make any color or tonal 
adjustments to your image is to take a good look at the quality and distribu-
tion of the tones throughout your image. I don’t mean just eyeballing the 
composite image on your screen. I’m talking about getting inside your image 

564
Introducing the Histogram Panel
and looking at its guts with the Histogram panel — and keeping it on-screen 
so you can see its constant feedback on your image adjustments.
A histogram displays the tonal range 
(also referred to as the key type) of 
an image, as shown in Figure 1-1. It 
shows how the pixels are distributed 
by graphing the number of pixels 
at each of the 256 brightness levels 
in an image. On this graph, pixels 
with the same brightness level are 
stacked in bars along a vertical axis. 
The higher the line from this axis, 
the greater the number of pixels 
at that brightness level. You can 
view the distribution for each color 
channel separately or for the com-
posite image as a whole.
 
From this graph, you can then deter-
mine whether the image contains 
enough detail in the shadow, mid-
tone, and highlight areas. This infor-
mation helps you determine what image adjustments you may need to make. 
The following steps walk you through the basics of using the panel and inter-
preting the information you find there:
 
1. Choose Window➪Histogram to bring up this graphical wonder.
 
 By default, the histogram displays the tonal range of the whole image, in 
the composite image’s color mode, such as RGB, CMYK, Grayscale, and 
so on. For details on color modes, see Book II, Chapter 2.
 
2. Select Compact View, Expanded View, or All Channels View from the 
Histogram panel pop-up menu:
 
• Compact View: The default. Displays only a histogram of the whole 
image (or your chosen selection or channel) with no controls or sta-
tistics.
 
• Expanded View: Shows a histogram with statistics and controls for 
selecting and viewing the histogram of individual channels. This view 
also has controls for refreshing the histogram to show uncached 
data and choosing a selected layer (on the Source pop-up menu). 
Refer to Figure 1-1 to see this view.
 
• All Channels View: Shown in Figure 1-2, this view displays all the 
options of the Expanded View, plus shows the individual histograms 
for each color channel. You may also choose to view your channels 
in color.
Figure 1-1: The Histogram panel displays 
how pixels are distributed at each of the 256 
brightness levels.

Figure 1-2: The All Channels View displays individual histograms for each color channel, as well 
as the composite channel.
 
3. Choose a different source in the Channel and/or Source pop-up menu, 
if needed.
 
 For example, instead of seeing a histogram for an entire image, you 
can display the histogram of an individual channel, alpha channel, or 
spot channel from the Channel pop-up menu.You can also focus on the 
selected layer or an adjustment layer. Just select the layer in the Layers 
panel and select Selected Layer or Adjustment Composite from the 
Source pop-up menu.
 
 For more on adjustment layers, see Book V, Chapter 1.
 
4. If the Cached Data Warning icon (a triangle with an exclamation 
mark) appears in the upper-right corner of the histogram, click the 
Uncached Refresh button just above the icon to see a histogram that 
reflects the image’s current state.

566
Introducing the Histogram Panel
 
 The warning lets you know that Photoshop is reading the histogram 
from cache rather than showing your image’s current state. Cache is a 
reserved, high-speed section of your computer’s memory. The image 
cache allows the histogram to display faster because it’s calculating 
the histogram based on a representative sampling of the pixels in your 
image.
 
 Unless it’s really bogging down your workflow, I recommend viewing 
your image’s histograms by using uncached data.
 
5. With the Histogram panel displaying the controls and data you want 
to check, examine the tonal range in the histogram.
 
 An image with good tonal range displays pixels in all areas. An image 
with poor tonal range has gaps in the histogram, as shown in Figure 1-3.
 
 The rest of this chapter explains ways you can correct color problems 
that you find.
Overexposed
Correct exposure
Underexposed
Figure 1-3: Images with poor tonal range have noticeable gaps in the histogram.
 
6. If you’re into numbers, check the statistics to evaluate your image, as 
well.
 
 See the sidebar “Understanding the histogram statistics,” in this chap-
ter, for how to interpret these details.

Choosing Automatic Color Correctors
 
 Position your cursor within the 
histogram to see statistics about 
a specific value. Drag your cursor 
within the histogram to see sta-
tistics about a range of values 
(Photoshop highlights the range).
 
When you make adjustments based 
on problems you see in the histo-
gram, be sure to select any Preview 
options in the dialog boxes of your 
image adjustments, such as Levels. 
That way, the Histogram panel dis-
plays both the original and adjusted 
histograms, as shown in Figure 1-4.
Choosing Automatic 
Color Correctors
Photoshop has three automatic correction tools that can, in many cases, 
improve appearance with a simple click of a menu command: Auto Tone, 
Auto Color, and Auto Contrast. Before you use them, first note their pros 
and cons:
Figure 1-4: Select the Preview option in image 
adjustment dialog boxes in order to view both 
the original and adjusted histograms.
Understanding the histogram statistics
The Histogram panel gives you all kinds of sta-
tistics about the pixels in your image. Some of 
these statistics, such as Standard Deviation, 
may be for those who live in the land of Calculus. 
But you may be able to glean some useful infor-
mation from the other statistics that can help 
you in your image-adjusting tasks. Here’s a 
brief explanation of each statistic:
 ✓ Mean: Average intensity value
 ✓ Standard Deviation: How much the inten-
sity values vary
 ✓ Median: Middle value of the intensity value 
range
 ✓ Pixels: Total number of pixels used to rep-
resent the histogram
 ✓ Cache Level: The current level of image 
cache used to calculate the histogram
These statistics display a value only when you 
position or drag your cursor in the histogram 
(each value corresponds only to the portion of 
the histogram under your cursor):
 ✓ Level: Intensity level
 ✓ Count: The total number of pixels corre-
sponding to that intensity level
 ✓ Percentile: The number of cumulative pixels 
(in percentages) at or below that level, from 
0% (left) to 100% (right)

568
Choosing Automatic Color Correctors
 
✓ The upside: These controls are easy to use. You don’t need to know 
much about toning, color balance, or contrast to use the automatic cor-
rectors (that’s why they’re automatic). But you can find out more about 
correcting tone, color balance, and contrast in sections later in this 
chapter, when I explain how to make adjustments manually.
 
✓ The downside: An automatic control’s ease of use almost always comes 
with a downside. In the case of the color correctors, none likely can do 
as good a job as you can do manually, and sometimes automatic con-
trols even do more harm than good.
 
If you have an average image (one that doesn’t require a great deal of cor-
rection), you can try out the automatic color correctors to see whether they 
help. I explain how in the following sections. If you don’t want to try the 
automatic controls, apply the manual tools explained in sections later in this 
chapter to produce the exact look you want.
Auto Tone
The Auto Tone command, formerly known as Auto Levels, uses a bit of built-
in Photoshop intelligence to automatically apply the Levels command (dis-
cussed in the section “Leveling for better contrast,” later in the chapter) to 
your image.
 
Auto Tone works best with average images that could use a bit of tweaking 
but have a lot of detail in the highlights (the brightest portions of an image 
that contain detail), shadows (the darkest portions of an image that contain 
detail), and midtones.
Auto Tone defines the very lightest and darkest pixels of each of the three 
colors as white and black, respectively, and then arranges the midtone 
pixels in between. While it balances the tones in your image, the command 
may reduce colorcasts or even introduce some. You can fine-tune the color 
manually after Auto Tone has done its work.
To try out the Auto Tone command, just choose Image➪Auto Tone or press 
Shift+Ctrl+L (Shift+Ô+L on the Mac).
 
Although Auto Tone can improve your contrast, it may also produce an 
unwanted colorcast (a slight trace of color). If this happens, cancel the com-
mand and try the Auto Contrast command. If that still doesn’t improve the 
contrast, try the Levels command instead. And even better, try your Levels 
adjustment on an adjustment layer. If it doesn’t work, you can always delete 
it. No harm, no muss. For more on adjustment layers, see Book V, Chapter 1.
Auto Color
The Auto Color command adjusts both the color and contrast of an image, 
based on the shadows, midtones, and highlights it finds in the image. You 

569
Book VIII
Chapter 1
Enhancing Images 
with Adjustments
Choosing Automatic Color Correctors
usually use this command to remove a colorcast (or bias) or balance the 
color in your image. Sometimes, using Auto Color can be helpful in cor-
recting oversaturated or undersaturated colors, as well. You can access 
the command by choosing Image➪Auto Color or by pressing Shift+Ctrl+B 
(Shift+Ô+B on the Mac).
Although Auto Color can do a good job on its own, you can customize 
the parameters it uses to make its color corrections in the Auto Color 
Corrections Options dialog box, which I discuss in the section “Setting Auto 
Color Correction Options,” later in this chapter. Figure 1-5 shows an image 
corrected by using Auto Tone and Auto Color.
Figure 1-5: Using Auto Tone and Auto Color quickly improved the contrast and colors of this 
snapshot.
Auto Contrast
Like its manually operated cousin, the Brightness/Contrast command, the 
Auto Contrast command fiddles with the overall contrast and colors (if 
you’re working with a color image) in an image, instead of making adjust-
ments to each color individually. Auto Contrast converts the lightest and 
darkest pixels to white and black, respectively, making all highlights in the 
image lighter and all shadows darker without changing the color values. 
This command may not do as good a job at improving contrast as Auto Tone 
does, but it retains the color balance of an image and doesn’t cause any 
nasty colorcasts.
 
Try using this command on hazy images. If you find it overdoes the adjust-
ment, try choosing Edit➪Fade and bringing down the Opacity level to blend 
the adjusted image with your original image. For more on using the Fade 
command, see Book VII, Chapter 1.

570
Setting Auto Color Correction Options
To use Auto Contrast, choose Image➪Auto Contrast or press Alt+Shift+
Ctrl+L (Option+Shift+Ô+L on the Mac).
Setting Auto Color Correction Options
You can use the Auto Color Correction Options dialog box to tweak exactly 
how Photoshop applies its Auto Tone, Auto Color, and Auto Contrast con-
trols, as well as for the manually operated Levels and Curves commands. 
You can apply the settings only to a particular image-editing session or save 
the settings as defaults for all your Photoshop work.
Setting color correction options is a more advanced task, and you can make 
best use of the tools if you already understand manual color and contrast cor-
rections. You can brush up on your color theory, too, in Book II, Chapter 3.
To customize the automatic options, follow these steps:
 
1. Open an image and choose Image➪Adjustments➪Levels or press 
Ctrl+L (Ô+L on the Mac).
 
 You can also use the Curves command by pressing Ctrl+M (Ô+M on 
the Mac).
 
2. Click the Options button in the 
dialog box to access the Auto 
Color Correction Options dialog 
box, shown in Figure 1-6.
 
3. In the Algorithms area, click the 
method you want Photoshop to 
use to adjust the tones.
 
 Your choices include
 
• Enhance Monochromatic 
Contrast: This option applies 
the same changes to the Red, 
Green, and Blue channels, 
making brighter areas appear 
lighter and shadow areas 
appear darker, with no changes 
made to the colors. (This is the 
method used by the Auto Contrast command.)
 
• Enhance Per Channel Contrast: This option individually adjusts the 
red, green, and blue colors so that each has its own best balance of 
light and dark tones, even if the color balance changes a bit. (This is 
the algorithm used by the Auto Tone command.)
Figure 1-6: After you know the basics, 
customize the auto correction options.

Setting Auto Color Correction Options
 
• Find Dark & Light Colors: This option locates the average lightest 
and darkest pixels, and uses their values to maximize the contrast of 
the image. (This is the algorithm used by the Auto Color command.)
 
4. Select the Snap Neutral Midtones check box if you want Photoshop to 
base its gamma, or midtone, correction values around a neutral color 
located in the image.
 
 The Auto Color command uses this option.
 
5. In the Target Colors & Clipping area, enter a value in each of the Clip 
text boxes.
 
 Setting clipping values between 0.5% and 1% eliminates the too-dark and 
too-light pixels.
 
 These values adjust the amount of black and white pixels that Photoshop 
removes from the darkest and lightest areas of the image. This option is 
useful because every image includes some very dark pixels that contain 
no real image information, as well as some very light pixels that are com-
pletely washed out. Factoring in these two kinds of pixels when you adjust 
tonal values is a waste. By setting the clipping values between 0.5% and 
1%, you leave these no-good pixels out of the picture, so to speak.
 
6. Click the Shadows, Midtones, or Highlights swatch.
 
 The Color Picker appears, allowing you to set a preferred value for the 
darkest, medium, and lightest areas.
 
7. Select the Eyedropper tool from the Tools panel.
 
8. Move your mouse over the image and locate the dark, middle, or light 
tone you want to use. Click it when you find it.
 
9. Click OK to exit the Color Picker. Repeat Steps 6 through 8 for each of 
the three colors you want to change.
 
 When you move the mouse over the image, the values in the Info panel 
change, helping you pick the shadow, midtone, or highlight area you 
want.
 
10. Back in the Auto Color Corrections dialog box, select the Save as 
Defaults check box to store the settings you just made for subsequent 
use in any Photoshop session.
 
 If you don’t select the check box, Photoshop applies the changes you 
made to only the current session.
 
11. Click OK to exit the Auto Color Correction Options dialog box.
 
 Your options are now customized. Note that these changes also affect 
the Auto buttons in the Levels and Curve dialog boxes.

Using Simple Color Correctors
Using Simple Color Correctors
Photoshop has several simple manual tools you can use to fix color in 
ways that are different from the Auto Tone, Auto Contrast, and Auto 
Color commands. They’re the Brightness/Contrast control, Color Balance, 
Desaturate command, and the ever-popular Variations tool (all found in the 
Image➪Adjustments menu). In the following sections, you can find out when 
to use (and when not to use) each of them.
Applying Brightness/Contrast
Beginners gravitate to the Brightness/Contrast control because it seems so 
intuitive to use. If your image is too dark, move a slider to make it lighter; if 
it’s too light, move the same slider to make it darker. Right? You can fix an 
image that’s overly contrasty or overly flat-looking the same way. Right?
Maybe.
I say Maybe and not flat out No 
because, in recent versions, Adobe 
has improved the command, as dem-
onstrated in Figure 1-7. Instead of 
applying all its adjustments equally to 
all areas of your image (whether they 
need it or not), it now applies adjust-
ments proportionately to your image, 
like the Levels and Curves adjustments 
do. Just steer clear of the Use Legacy 
option, which reverts the Brightness 
and Contrast command back to its pre-
CS3 algorithm, thereby turning your 
image into a mess.
 
Even though Adobe has improved the 
Brightness and Contrast command, 
you’re better off using Levels and 
Curves, which can tailor your image 
enhancements to the exact portions of 
the image you want to work with.
Tweaking with the Color 
Balance controls
With an understanding of color theory 
(which I explain in Book II, Chapter 
3), you can probably use the Color Balance controls to make some simple 
changes to the color in your image. The difficult part is recognizing exactly 
which color you need to add or subtract from your image in the first place.
Figure 1-7: The Brightness and Contrast 
command attempts to improve tonal values 
in your image.

Using Simple Color Correctors
Colors are subtler than you might think. For example, a slight colorcast 
toward cyan can look a lot like a slightly green or blue colorcast. Is your 
image too red, or does it have too much magenta?
 
Use the Variations command that I describe in the section “Correcting 
Colorcast with Variations,” later in this chapter, to figure out how to tell the 
various colorcasts apart. The Variations command displays each of the dif-
ferent types of colorcasts in an array so you can compare them.
To use the Color Balance controls, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Image➪Adjustments➪Color Balance or press Ctrl+B (Ô+B on 
the Mac) to access the Color Balance dialog box.
 
2. Choose the Shadows, Midtones, or Highlights option to select the 
tones of an image you want to work on.
 
 Usually, Midtones is the best choice, unless your image has a colorcast 
in the shadows or highlights that doesn’t affect the overall image. That 
can sometimes happen when a subject is close to a colored wall or other 
object that reflects light onto, say, the shadowed side of a subject.
 
3. Select the Preserve Luminosity option.
 
 When this option is selected, Photoshop modifies the colors of the 
image, but the brightness and contrast of the tones stay the same. If 
you’re not happy with the results, uncheck the option.
 
4. Move the Cyan/Red, Magenta/Green, or Yellow/Blue slider to add or 
subtract color, watching the effects of your adjustments on the 
original image.
Resisting the urge to go nuts with sliders
If you’re like me, you like clicking options, 
adjusting values, and sliding sliders back and 
forth. Thankfully, Photoshop is happy to oblige 
you with options to make you feel so powerful 
that you can take on any project.
Was that a sinister laugh I heard? Easy there, 
partner. I’m about to tell you something that will 
break your heart at first — but you’ll thank me 
later: Always pick a single slider and stick with 
it when you’re trying to compensate for any col-
orcast. Moving two sliders is a waste because 
you can accomplish anything you want with 
just one.
For example, if you move both the Cyan/Red and 
Magenta/Green sliders an equal amount to the 
left (adding cyan and magenta), you’re actually 
just adding blue. Moving three sliders is even 
worse because, depending on the amount and 
direction of movement, the three sliders are 
likely to at least partially cancel each other out 
or multiply the effects. However, if a cast is in 
just one area, such as the shadows, and a dif-
ferent colorcast is in another area, it may be 
useful to do more than one adjustment.

574
Fixing Lighting with Shadow/Highlight
 
 The Color Levels boxes show the amount of each color that Photoshop 
adds and subtracts while you move the sliders. Figure 1-8 shows an 
example of subtracting green to improve the color in an image.
Purestock
Figure 1-8: Use the Color Balance adjustment to remove colorcasts from an image.
 
 The colors are arranged by their opposites on the color wheel. Dragging 
the slider toward Cyan adds cyan to the image and subtracts its comple-
ment, red. Dragging toward Green adds green to the image and subtracts 
magenta.
Fixing Lighting with Shadow/Highlight
The Shadow/Highlight adjustment is a great feature that offers a quick and 
easy method for correcting over- and underexposed areas in your image. 
This command works well on a subject photographed with the light source 
coming from behind (backlit), giving that subject a dark foreground. The 
adjustment can also bring out the detail in harsh shadow areas in subjects 
shot in bright, overhead light, as shown in Figure 1-9.

Book VIII
Chapter 1

Fixing Lighting with Shadow/Highlight
Original
Adjusted with Shadow-Highlight
Figure 1-9: The Shadow/Highlight adjustment is a quick way to correct the lighting in your 
images.
To familiarize yourself with this tool, follow these steps:
 
1. Open an image in dire need of repair and choose 
Image➪Adjustments➪Shadows/Highlights.
 
 Note that you can also adjust CMYK images, as well as RGB.
 
 When the dialog box appears, the correction is automatically applied 
in your preview. If you don’t see any change, make sure you’ve selected 
the Preview check box. The default settings in the dialog box are meant 
to correct backlit images, so they may or may not do the right correc-
tion job for you with the default settings.
 
2. Move the Amount slider to adjust the amount of correction for your 
Shadows and/or your Highlights.
 
 The higher the percentage, the lighter the shadows and the darker the 
highlights. You can also enter a value in the percentage text box.
 
3. If you’re happy with the results, you can click OK and be done with 
the adjustment. However, if you crave more control, click the Show 
More Options check box at the bottom of the dialog box.
 
 A whole array of sliders magically appears, as shown in Figure 1-10.
 
4. Drag the Tonal Width slider to increase or decrease the range of tones 
adjusted in the shadows or highlights.
 
 The lower the percentage, the narrower the range of tones that are 
affected. For example, by using a very low percentage, only the darkest 

576
Fixing Lighting with Shadow/Highlight
parts of the shadow or the light-
est parts of the highlight are 
corrected. A higher percentage 
includes a wide range of tones, 
including midtone areas. The 
appropriate percentage to use 
varies among images, so start with 
the default setting of 50% and work 
in small increments from there.
 
 If, when lightening the shadow 
areas, you find the midtones and 
highlights getting too light, reduce 
the Tonal Width percentage of the 
Shadows. But, if you start seeing 
artifacts, you’ve set the percentage 
too high.
 
5. Drag the Radius slider to increase 
or decrease the number of pixels 
used in the local neighborhood.
 
 To fix lighting, this command light-
ens or darkens pixels according 
to the luminance (brightness) of 
the surrounding pixels, techni-
cally called a local neighborhood. 
The best local neighborhood size 
depends on the particular image, 
so play with this slider and view the results. If the Radius is too small, 
your main subject may lack contrast. Conversely, if it’s too large, your 
background may be overly bright or dark. Adobe recommends setting 
the radius to approximately half the size of the main subject in your 
image. So, if your subject takes up roughly 600 pixels, then set your 
radius to 300 pixels.
 
6. Make additional changes in the Adjustments area, as needed:
 
• Color Correction: Available for color images only, this control 
enables you to correct the colors in only the adjusted portions of 
your image. Often, when you increase or decrease the Amount of 
Shadows or Highlights, you bring out the “hidden” colors. Generally, 
higher Color Correction values make colors more saturated, whereas 
lower values make colors more desaturated.
 
• Brightness: Available for grayscale images only. Move the slider left 
to darken and right to lighten.
 
• Midtone Contrast: Move the slider left to reduce contrast and right 
to increase contrast. Just be aware that when you increase the 
Midtone Contrast, you may also undesirably darken shadow areas 
and lighten highlight areas.
Figure 1-10: The Shadow and Highlight 
dialog box offers controls for adjusting 
the amount of correction in your shadow, 
midtone, and highlight areas.

Adjusting Exposure
 
• Black Clip/White Clip: As I explain in the section “Setting Auto Color 
Correction Options,” earlier in this chapter, setting clipping values 
between 0.5% and 1% eliminates the too-dark and too-light pixels.
 
7. Click the Save As Defaults button to save and make your settings the 
defaults.
 
 If you want to reset the settings back to the original defaults, hold down 
Shift and click the Save As Defaults button. You can save as many settings 
as you want. Click the Load button to reload a particular setting. To save 
the settings as new settings, but not as the defaults, click the Save button.
 
8. Click OK to apply the adjustment and exit the dialog box.
Adjusting Exposure
This Exposure adjustment is primarily meant to correct tonal values of High 
Dynamic Range (HDR) images, which are 32-bit. (In layman’s terms, the bits indi-
cate how much information is stored about the color. The more bits, the better 
the color.) But you can apply Exposure adjustments to 16-bit or even 8-bit 
images, as well. This command works by using a linear color space, also known 
as gamma 1.0, rather than your image’s color space, to make tonal adjustments. 
Figure 1-11 shows an example of an image helped by this adjustment.
Figure 1-11: Fix tonal values with the Exposure adjustment.

578
Correcting Colorcast with Variations
 
If you use the Exposure adjustment with 16-bit or 8-bit images, the slider’s 
adjustments may be too drastic. Hold down the Ctrl (Ô on the Mac) key 
when your mouse is over the number field and drag to access the scrubby 
sliders, which offer a less dramatic adjustment when you slide the control. 
Also, keep an eye on your image. The Exposure adjustment sometimes clips, 
or loses, data on lower-bit images.
To apply the Exposure adjustment, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Image➪Adjustments➪Exposure.
 
2. Adjust any of the following:
 
• Exposure: This option adjusts mainly the highlights and pretty much 
ignores the darkest shadows.
 
• Offset: This option darkens the shadow and midtone values, and 
leaves the highlights alone.
 
• Gamma Correction: This option adjusts the image’s gamma, or mid-
tone, values.
 
3. Use the Eyedroppers to adjust the luminance, or brightness, values in 
the image.
 
 Note that this is different from Levels, where the eyedroppers adjust all 
the color channels:
 
• Set Black Point Eyedropper: Sets the Offset. The pixel you click 
becomes the black point.
 
• Set White Point Eyedropper: Sets the Exposure. The pixel you click 
becomes the white point.
 
• Midtone Eyedropper: Sets the Exposure. The pixel you click 
becomes the middle gray value.
 
4. Click OK to apply the adjustment.
 
 To save the settings, click the Save Preset button (to the right of OK). 
Name the preset and click Save in the Save dialog box. Apply the preset 
later by clicking the Load button.
Correcting Colorcast with Variations
Photoshop’s Variations feature is a variation (so to speak) on the profes-
sional photographer’s ring around (a set of color prints, each made with 
slightly different color balance) or test strip (a single print of an image made 
so that each section is shown using a different color balance). Both tools let 
you view several renditions of an image and choose the best one visually 
by comparing them. You might want to use Variations when you’re unsure 
exactly how the color is biased and you want to compare several versions of 
an image to see exactly what the colorcast is.

Putting It Together
Correcting Tinted, Faded Photos
In this Putting It Together project, I employ the Variations feature to restore the color in a 
scan of a color print originally made in 1965. Unfortunately, the years have not been kind 
to this photo; it has a slight, but annoying, greenish tinge because the magenta dye layer 
of the print has faded. As a result, the other two color layers, cyan and yellow, appear 
proportionately stronger when compared to the magenta that remains, and cyan and 
yellow make green.
I plan to use the Variations feature of Photoshop to restore the magenta layer in this 
photo that’s green with age.
To correct colorcast in an old photograph by using the Photoshop Variations feature, 
follow these steps:
 
1. In Photoshop, open an old, fading photo that needs color correction.
 
 In this case, I’m using an old, faded, greenish-looking picture, shown in the ﬁ gure, 
but any colorcast works.

2. Choose Image➪Adjustments➪Variations from the menu bar.
 
 The Variations dialog box appears.
 
3. Select the Show Clipping option to tell Photoshop to show any areas of the image that 
will be “overwhelmed” by the correction you’re contemplating.
 
 That is, no new information is added.
 
4. If you want to use corrections you saved, load those settings by clicking the Load but-
ton. Otherwise, skip to Step 5.
 
5. Make adjustments with the Fine/Coarse slider.
 
 In my example, the greenish picture needs some magenta, so I dragged the Fine/Coarse 
slider to the left. I wanted to have a smaller increment of change when I adjust the 
color.
 
 You can also click one of the tick marks to move the slider to that position. Photoshop 
doesn’t allow setting the control to any of the intermediate positions between the 
marks.

6. Make sure that you’ve selected the Midtones radio button, and then click the Preview 
window containing the amount of color you want to add.
 
 Watch the Current Pick thumbnail, which reﬂ ects the correction.
 
 In my case, I need to click the More Magenta image.
 
 Click several times if your initial application isn’t enough or click other Preview win-
dows to add additional colors.
 
 Photoshop applies your corrections only to the middle tones of the image. In many 
cases, that’s sufﬁ cient. However, sometimes shadows take on a particular hue, or the 
highlights may gain colorcasts of their own.
 
7. Click the Highlights and/or Shadows radio buttons to add colors only to those parts of 
the photo.
 
 Variations isn’t the best tool to make complex color corrections, so be careful.
 
 You might be able to see a highlight color in the shadows under the pillow, most notice-
able in the More Magenta preview. The highlight is the Clipping indicator showing that 
the change made by that Preview window is too much for that particular area of the 
picture. That is, Photoshop can’t add any more magenta to the highlighted area without 
losing detail in the image.
 
8. Click the Darker preview (in the lower-right corner of the dialog box) to make the 
photo a little darker.
 
 Adjust the Fine/Coarse slider to adjust the amount of change, or gradually darken and 
lighten the image by clicking multiple times.
 
 In my case, only one click is necessary.
 
9. Click the Saturation radio button to brighten the colors and use the Fine/Coarse slider 
to control how much saturation you add or remove.
 
 The Variations feature also lets you adjust the purity of color, or saturation, of the colors 
in an image. Now, only three previews appear: a less-saturated version, the current 
choice, and a more-saturated version. My photo was washed out, or undersaturated, 
so I clicked the More Saturation button.
 
10. To save your settings, click the Save button, apply a name to the settings, and store 
them in the folder of your choice.

582
Washing Out Color with Desaturate
continued
 
 I recommend saving your settings, especially if you’re working on a copy of the 
origi nal image and want to apply the same corrections later, or if you plan to correct 
several photos that have the same color defects.
Although not as sophisticated as some color-correction techniques, the 
Variations feature has the advantage of being quick and simple, and it 
doesn’t require a lot of training to use.
Washing Out Color with Desaturate
Sometimes, you don’t want any color at all. Photoshop’s Desaturate com-
mand can wash all the color out of a layer or selection.
 
Just because you can do something doesn’t mean you should. Use this 
command with caution because neither the Desaturate command nor 
Photoshop’s Image➪Mode➪Grayscale command is the best technique for 
converting a color image to monochrome. Simply removing the color can 
produce an image that appears to be too low in contrast, which is another 
kettle of fish altogether. See Book II, Chapter 2, along with the section 
“Converting to Black & White,” later in this chapter, for a better way to 
create grayscale images.

583
Book VIII
Chapter 1
Enhancing Images 
with Adjustments
Working with Professional Color Correctors
However, if you simply want to eliminate the color from a layer or selection 
image quickly, the Desaturate command does the job. To apply it, select 
your desired layer in the Layers panel, select the area you want to operate 
on, and then choose Image➪Adjustments➪Desaturate or press Shift+Ctrl+U 
(Shift+Ô+U on the Mac).
Using the Saturation control in the Hue/Saturation command gives you 
better control over the degree of desaturation you desire, while leaving 
the image looking richer. I show you how to play with saturation by using 
the Hue/Saturation controls in the section “Getting colorful with Hue/
Saturation,” later in this chapter.
Working with Professional Color Correctors
The simple color correctors I discuss in the section “Using Simple Color 
Correctors,” earlier in this chapter, usually aren’t enough to provide thor-
ough color correction if you have a really problematic image on your hands. 
Fortunately, Photoshop has the kind of professional tools needed to make 
sophisticated color corrections for higher-end color printing. You don’t have 
to be a pro to use the Levels or Curves commands, nor to work with the 
Hue/Saturation controls. But you’ll feel like one after you master these pow-
erful tools.
Leveling for better contrast
If you want to adjust tonal values of images (the brightness or darkness of 
tones) or correct colors (the relationship between the colors), the Levels 
command is the tool for you. It offers more control than the Auto Tone 
command, which I discuss in the section “Auto Tone,” earlier in this chap-
ter. The Levels command is also a much more sophisticated tool than the 
Brightness/Contrast control because you can work with individual tones, 
brightening or darkening individual tones as you want, and you have a great 
deal more information to help you make your choices.
Open the Levels dialog box, shown in Figure 1-12, by pressing Ctrl+L (Ô+L 
on the Mac) or choosing Image➪Adjustments➪Levels. The graph shown in 
the center of the dialog box is a histogram, which I describe in detail in the 
section “Introducing the Histogram Panel,” earlier in this chapter. You can 
use this dialog box, histogram and all, for evaluating and adjusting levels in 
the following ways:
 
✓ Visually check the distribution of dark, midtone, and light values.
 
✓ View separate histograms for each channel. The default histogram 
displays information for the entire image. To see the histogram of an 
individual channel, select it from the Channel pop-up menu. For an RGB 

584
Working with Professional Color Correctors
image, you can view the Red, 
Green, and Blue channels. For 
a CMYK image, you can view 
the Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and 
Black channels. You can view 
the histograms of each chan-
nel simultaneously by using the 
Histogram panel.
 
✓ Adjust the black and white 
points based on the histogram. 
The three triangles at the bottom 
of the histogram, in black, 
gray, and white, represent the 
shadow on the left, midtone in 
the middle, and highlight on 
the right. Even though they’re 
located where they are, many 
images have no black tones at 
the far-left side of the scale, nor 
white tones at the far-right side.
 
 One of the simplest corrections you can do is to move the black and 
white sliders so that they actually correspond to the pixels containing 
dark and light tones. Simply slide the black triangle so that it corre-
sponds to the first true black pixels in the image (the beginning of the 
histogram), and then move the white triangle to align it with the lightest 
pixels (the end of the histogram). That ensures that Photoshop doesn’t 
waste tones by allocating them to areas of the image that actually have 
no image detail. Figure 1-13 shows an example of an image that was res-
cued by the use of the Levels adjustment.
Figure 1-13: Applying the Levels command to a dark photo dramatically improves the contrast.
Figure 1-12: The Levels dialog box offers 
controls for adjusting the contrast in your 
image.

✓ See exactly what happens when you use the Auto Tone command. 
When you click the Auto button, which applies the same adjustments as 
the Auto Tone command, Photoshop applies its own suggested changes, 
resetting the white point and the black point, and redistributing the gray 
values of the pixels in between. Afterward, the histogram shows that the 
pixels fill the complete range from white to black.
Setting black and white points manually
For more control, you can use the Eyedropper tools in the Levels dialog box 
to set the black and white points. Just follow these steps:
 
1. Open an image and choose Image➪Adjustments➪Levels.
 
 Make sure you have the Info panel open (Window➪Info), and display the 
HSB and RGB color modes. (To do this, select Panel Options from the 
Info panel pop-up menu and select HSB and RGB from the Color Readout 
pop-up menus.) See Book II, Chapters 2 and 3 for more on color modes.
 
 Remember that you can also apply certain adjustments, such as 
Levels, via an adjustment layer rather than directly to the image itself. 
Adjustment layers provide more editing flexibility if you later decide you 
need to tweak the adjustment. For more on adjustment layers, see Book 
V, Chapter 1.
 
2. Select the White Eyedropper tool and move it around the image while 
watching the Info panel.
 
3. Look for the lightest white in the image, which may be anywhere from 
90% to 100% in brightness (the B under HSB). Select that point by 
clicking.
 
4. Using the Black Eyedropper tool, repeat the process outlined in Steps 
2 and 3 to select the darkest black in the image, which may be any-
where from 0% to 10% in brightness (B).
 
 The combination of these two choices redistributes the pixels from pure 
white to pure black.
 
 You can also set the white and black points by moving the position of 
the white and black triangles on the input sliders (just under the histo-
gram). Or you can enter numbers in the Input Levels boxes. The three 
boxes represent the black, gray, and white triangles, respectively. Use 
the numbers 0 to 255 in the white and black boxes.
 
5. Use the Gray Eyedropper tool to remove any colorcasts. Select an area 
of your image that should be neutral gray, one in which the Info panel 
shows equal values of red, green, and blue.
 
 Note that the Gray Eyedropper tool isn’t available when you’re working 
on grayscale images.

586
Working with Professional Color Correctors
 
 Although you generally make changes to the entire document by using 
the RGB channel, you can apply changes to any one of an image’s com-
ponent color channels by selecting the specific channel in the Channel 
drop-down menu at the top of the Levels dialog box (refer to Figure 1-12). 
You can also make adjustments to selected areas only. This can be help-
ful when one area of your image needs adjusting but others don’t. See 
Book III, Chapter 1 for details on making selections.
 
6. Adjust the output sliders at the very bottom of the Levels dialog box.
 
 Moving the black triangle to the right reduces the contrast in the shad-
ows and lightens the image. Moving the white triangle to the left reduces 
the contrast in the highlights and darkens the image.
 
7. Adjust the midtones with the gray triangle slider (it appears between 
the black and white input sliders, just under the histogram).
 
 The values you’re adjusting are called the gamma values.
 
 Dragging this triangle to the left lightens the midtones. Dragging it to the 
right darkens the midtones while leaving the highlights and shadows 
alone. You can also move the gray triangle by entering numbers from 
9.99 to 0.1 in the center option box. The default value (1.0) lies exactly in 
the middle of the range.
 
 If you’re working with a series of similar images (such as a bunch of 
video captures), you can save the settings to reuse them later.
 
 You can also now select a preset Levels setting, such as Increase 
Contrast or Lighten Shadows, from the Preset pop-up menu in the Levels 
dialog box. Use a preset as your starting point and then fine-tune the 
adjustment manually by adjusting the input sliders, as described in the 
preceding steps.
 
8. Click the Save button to store your settings.
 
 This step saves the settings, but it doesn’t apply them. Just click the 
Load button to retrieve them.
 
9. Click OK to apply your settings and exit the dialog box.
Adjusting curves for hard-to-correct photos
The Curves command is one of the most advanced Photoshop correction 
tools available, offering sophisticated control over the brightness, contrast, 
and midtone (gamma) levels in an image; I’m talking about control that’s far 
beyond what the Levels and Brightness/Contrast dialog boxes offer. This 
section introduces you to the functions of the Curves command, but you’ll 
want to practice using it a great deal to gain the kind of experience you need 
to work with it effectively.
Whereas the Brightness/Contrast dialog box lets you change an image glob-
ally, and the Levels command allows you to change the shadows, highlights, 

587
Book VIII
Chapter 1
Enhancing Images 
with Adjustments
Working with Professional Color Correctors
and midtones separately, Curves goes far beyond either of those settings. It 
lets you change pixel values at 16 different points (which include start and 
end points) along an image’s tonal range. You can work with the combined 
Red, Green, and Blue color channels (or CMYK channels) or apply your 
changes to the individual colors. Often, images that just can’t be fixed to 
your satisfaction with Levels can be helped with the Curves adjustment, as 
shown in Figure 1-14.
Figure 1-14: The Curves adjustment offers more control and sophistication than many other color 
correction tools.
Working with the Curves dialog box
You access the Curves dialog box, shown in Figure 1-15, by choosing 
Image➪Adjustments➪Curves or by pressing Ctrl+M (Ô+M on the Mac).
The following tips help you to begin understanding how to interpret the 
information and use the tools in this dialog box:
 
✓ The horizontal axis maps the brightness values as they are before 
image correction (input).

588
Working with Professional Color Correctors
 
✓ The vertical axis maps the 
brightness values after cor-
rection (output). Each axis 
represents a continuum 
of 256 levels, divided into 
four parts by finely dotted 
lines. In the default mode, 
the lower-left corner rep-
resents 0,0 (pure black) 
and the upper-right corner 
is 255,255 (pure white). 
By default, the dialog box 
shows a 4-x-4 (quarter tone) 
grid; Alt-click (Option-click 
on the Mac) inside the 
grid to toggle it to a 10-x-
10 (10% increment) grid. If 
you have the Curve Display 
Options visible, you can use 
the Quarter Tone or 10% 
Increment display buttons.
 
✓ Whenever you open 
the Curves dialog box, 
the graph begins as a 
straight line. Unless you 
make changes, the input 
is exactly the same as the 
output, a direct 1-to-1 cor-
relation.
 
✓ You can expand the Curve Display Options and specify the following:
 
• Show Amount Of: Choose between Light and Pigment to display the 
brightness levels or percentages. To keep things simple, I’d leave 
them at the default of Light (levels), where darker values are at the 
bottom-left and lighter values are at the top-right. Choose between a 
simple or detailed grid (icons).
 
• Show: If you’re adjusting curves for individual channels, choose 
Channel Overlays to superimpose those individual curves. Select 
Baseline to show your original straight line curve. Choose to dis-
play a histogram overlay. For more on histograms, see the section 
“Introducing the Histogram Panel,” earlier in this chapter. Check 
Intersection Line to display horizontal and vertical lines to help you 
align your points while you drag them on the curve.
 
✓ The Eyedropper can show you pixel values. When you use the 
Eyedropper tool to click in the image, a circle appears on the graph to 
show you the value of the pixel being sampled. At the bottom of the 
Curves grid box, you can read the pixel’s input and output values.

✓ Auto sets black and white values. When you click the Auto button, the 
darkest pixels in the image (the deep shadows) are reset to black, and 
the lightest areas are set to white. Like with the Levels dialog box, this 
option is the easiest way to make a correction but may not be the best.
 
✓ Eyedropper tools can also set black, white, and gray values. The 
Curves dialog box has black, white, and gray Eyedropper tools you can 
use to set the black, white, and midtone points, just like you can with 
Levels.
 
✓ Select the Show Clipping options to have Photoshop display where 
clipping occurs in the image during your corrections. Remember, clip-
ping occurs when a pixel’s values are lighter or darker than the highest 
or lowest value that can be displayed in the image, resulting in loss of 
detail in those areas.
Adjusting curves
If you click at any point on the curve other than the end points, Photoshop 
adds a control point that shows your position. You can remove a control 
point by dragging it downward until it’s completely off the graph or by drag-
ging it on top of the next point up or down from it on the graph. You can add 
up to 14 points to the curve.
Curve presets are located at the very top of the Curves dialog box. If you’re a 
Curves novice, trying one of these presets is a good way to get your feet wet 
in how curves work. Note that when you select a preset, a curve is loaded 
into your dialog box. You can also use a preset as a starting point and then 
tweak it further with your own adjustments. Experiment with the curves to 
see how they affect the image. For example
 
✓ Click the Auto button to have Photoshop analyze your image’s color and 
tonal values, and make an automatic adjustment. Again, you can use this 
preset as a starting point and tweak from there.
 
✓ Flattening a curve lowers contrast.
 
✓ Making a curve steeper heightens contrast.
 
✓ Moving a curve downward (if the display is set to Light) darkens the 
image. Moving it upward lightens.
 
✓ If your display is set to Light, adjust your highlights by moving points in 
the top-right of the curve, shadows by adjusting points in the bottom-left 
of the curve, and midtones by moving points in the center of the curve.
 
✓ A gently sloped S-shaped curve increases contrast, especially in the 
highlight and shadow areas. Using a curve like this also helps to define 
the midtones.
 
✓ For ultimate control, Photoshop lets you draw a curve with the precise 
shape you want, creating an arbitrary curve or map. Click the Pencil tool 

590
Working with Professional Color Correctors
and then draw peaks and valleys in the Curves dialog box. Watch the 
changes in your original image.
 
✓ You can also add points to the curve by holding down Ctrl (Ô on the 
Mac) and clicking your image. Adding points is beneficial if you want to 
preserve an area in your image.
 
✓ If you want to adjust the color in your image, select your desired chan-
nel from the Channel pop-up menu and then adjust the curve. For more 
on channels, see Book VI.
 
Arbitrary maps, such as the one shown in Figure 1-16, create distinctive 
solarization color effects when Photoshop warps the colors of your image. 
They’re fun to play with, maybe useful now and then, but not nearly as prac-
tical as S curves.

After you create a custom curve, you may want to save it (a good idea) to 
load and apply it to other photos with similar contrast issues. Click the 
Preset Options button (just to the left of the OK button) and select Save 
Preset from the pop-up menu that appears.

Converting to Black & White
Photoshop provides a great way to convert a color image to grayscale with 
the Black & White feature. For other ways to make your image grayscale, see 
Book II, Chapter 2 and the section “Washing Out Color with Desaturate,” 
earlier in this chapter.
The great thing about the Black & White feature is that, like the Channel 
Mixer (which you can read about in Book VI, Chapter 1), you have a lot of 
control over how your colors are converted.
Here’s how to go to grayscale by using Black & White:
 
1. Choose Image➪Adjustments➪Black & White.
 
 Your Black and White dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 1-17. In addi-
tion, Photoshop automatically applies a default conversion to your image.
 
2. Adjust the conversion to your liking by doing one of the following:
 
• Choose a Preset: Select a preset conversion (or a custom one you 
saved previously) from the pop-up menu. Note that you can also use 
one of the presets as a starting point and then adjust from there.
 
• Click Auto: This option analyzes your image’s color values and 
then converts to grayscale, while trying to maximize your gray tonal 
values. Again, this conversion can be used as a starting point.
 
• Adjust the sliders: Do your own thing. Drag the sliders left to darken 
and right to lighten the tones. That’s what I did in my example in 
Figure 1-17. Note that your mouse turns into an eyedropper when 
you move or click over your image. Click areas of your image to 
highlight that dominant color in your dialog box. Click and drag on 
the image itself with the eyedropper to move the color slider for that 
color, making it darker or lighter.
 
3. If desired, select the Tint button to apply a tone of color to the black 
and white image.
 
 Adjust the Hue and Saturation sliders to choose a tint color and inten-
sity of that color. Click the color swatch to access the Color Picker, 
where you can select another color.
 
If you totally goof up your image, hold down Alt (Option on the Mac) and 
click the color chip to reset that adjustment. To reset all adjustments, hold 
down Alt (Option on the Mac) to convert the Cancel button into Reset and 
click that button.
 
After you establish a custom conversion setting, save it to apply to other 
similar images by selecting Save Preset from the Preset Options pop-up 
menu, just to the left of the OK button.

Getting colorful with Hue/Saturation
Photoshop’s Hue/Saturation controls let you adjust colors based on their hue, 
saturation, and lightness. The Hue/Saturation dialog box doesn’t work with 
the Red, Green, and Blue (or Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black) channels of an 
image. Instead, it operates on the different colors, or hues. You can select all 
the colors (Master) from the Edit pop-up menu or one color to modify.
Three sliders are in the Hue/Saturation dialog box (see Figure 1-18):
 
✓ Hue: Shifts all the colors clockwise or counterclockwise around the 
color wheel, depending on the direction you move the slider. I moved 
my Hue slider to the left to turn the image green and purple.
 
✓ Saturation: Increases or decreases the richness of the colors in an 
image. I moved my Saturation slider to the right to increase the satura-
tion and make the image almost glow.
 
✓ Lightness: Modifies the brightness values.
You can adjust any of these values by moving the sliders and watching the 
results in the image window. The top color bar at the bottom of the dialog 
box represents the colors in their order on the color wheel before you made 
any adjustment. The lower color bar shows how the modifications you make 
affect the colors.
 
Select the new slider (the pointing finger icon) to adjust your Hue and 
Saturation values. With the icon selected, drag directly on your image to 
adjust the Saturation. Hold down the Ctrl (Ô on the Mac) key and drag on 
your image to adjust the Hue.
 
When you select an individual color to adjust, sliders appear between the 
color bars so that you can define the range of color to be adjusted. You 
can select, add, or subtract colors from the range by selecting one of the 
Eyedropper tools and clicking in the image.

ImageState
Figure 1-18: The Hue/Saturation command enables you to adjust colors based on their hue 
(color), saturation (intensity), or lightness (brightness).
 
You can also now select a Hue/Saturation preset, such as Old Style or Sepia, 
from the Preset pop-up menu in the Hue/Saturation dialog box.
The Hue/Saturation dialog box also lets you colorize images, a useful option 
for creating sepia colored images, like in the Putting It Together project 
“Making a New Photo Look Old,” in this chapter.
Using the Colorize option
Use the Colorize option in the Hue/Saturation dialog box to change the color 
of any selected area to a new, solid color. This option is unlike the Hue 
slider, which changes only individual pixels based on their present color 
values. Just follow these steps:
 
1. Open an image and access the Hue/Saturation dialog box by choosing 
Image➪Adjustments➪Hue/Saturation or pressing Ctrl+U (Ô+U on 
the Mac).
 
2. Select the Colorize option.

594
Working with Professional Color Correctors
 
3. Drag the Hue slider in either direction to change a color.
 
 Photoshop doesn’t colorize pure white pixels and pure black pixels 
because colorization affects only gray pixels (from a brightness value of
1 to 254).
 
 You can also adjust the Saturation and Lightness, if desired.
Pumping up the Vibrance
 
Think of the new Vibrance adjustment as a souped-up, more intelligent Hue/
Saturation command. This adjustment increases the saturation in an image 
but does it in a non-linear fashion. Therefore, pixels with a lower satura-
tion get more adjustment, and pixels with a higher saturation get less. As 
a bonus, the adjustment includes a built-in skin-tone protector to prevent 
faces from becoming overly red. Choose Image➪Adjustments➪Vibrance. In 
the Vibrance dialog box, move the Vibrance and Saturation sliders to the 
right to increase each. But use a light touch with this adjustment. A little 
goes a long way, as shown in Figure 1-19.

Making a New Photo Look Old
Black-and-white photography is a newer phenomenon than you might think. Daguerreo-
types and other early photographs frequently had a brownish or bluish tone to them. 
You can create sepia-toned masterpieces of your own. (Or, if you want, you can create 
a tint in green, blue, or another shade.) Toned pictures can create a mood or otherwise 
transform a mundane photo into something interesting.
In this Putting It Together project, I chose a recent photo of a boy and his donkey in Java, 
Indonesia. Without any nasty anachronisms, such as automobiles or satellite dishes, 
aging this image is easy.
The Photoshop Hue/Saturation feature is all you need to perform this time-traveling 
magic. Just follow these easy steps:
 
1. Open the image in Photoshop and convert it to 
black and white by choosing Image➪
Adjustments➪Black & White. Click OK.
 
 You choose this command rather than the 
Image➪Mode➪Grayscale command to convert 
the photo to black and white because you’re going 
to continue to work with it as a color image — the 
image just won’t have colors until you add them. 
For more info on the Black & White adjustment, see 
the earlier section, “Converting to Black & White.”
 
2. Choose Image➪Adjustments➪Hue/ Saturation.
 
 The Hue/Saturation dialog box appears.
 
3. Select the Colorize check box so that you can add 
color to the image.
 
4. Adjust the Hue slider to produce the 
tone you’re looking for.
 
 To produce a rich sepia tone, move 
the Hue slider to the far left. If you 
prefer green, blue, or some other 
shade, you can experiment with this 
slider to get the exact color you want.

5. Adjust the Saturation slider to modify the richness of the color.
 
 I used a setting of 25, as shown in the ﬁ gure. When you move the slider to the right, 
the color becomes more pure. You end up with a striking red at the far-right position.
 
6. Adjust the Lightness slider to lighten or darken the 
photo, depending on your mood.
 
 
Generally, you want to leave the Lightness slider 
at the default middle position. To create a darker, 
moodier picture, move it to the left; to produce a 
more faded look, move it to the right.
 
7. When you’re satisﬁ ed with your changes, click OK.
 
 Now, my photo looks like a vintage postcard.
 
 You can create similar effects by using the Photo-
shop Duotones, Tritones, and Quadtones features. 
See Book II, Chapter 2 for more information on 
these tools. You can also try the Tint options in the 
Black & White adjustment (see the section “Con-
verting to Black & White,” in this chapter).
Corbis Digital Stock
Matching Color between Documents
The Match Color command enables you to match colors in a single image 
or between images — a source image and a target image. But it doesn’t stop 
there. You can also match colors between layers or even selections. You can 
further refine your correction by adjusting the luminance and color intensity 
(saturation).
 
This command is great for getting rid of colorcasts in a single image. It also 
works wonders for matching the color of the lighting between two images or 
layers — for example, if you want to realistically composite an image shot 
under fluorescent lighting and one shot in natural light.
 
The Match Color command works only with RGB images, but be sure to 
apply this command before you perform any color conversions.

597
Book VIII
Chapter 1
Enhancing Images 
with Adjustments
Matching Color between Documents
Follow these steps to use the Match Color command to match one image 
with another:
 
1. Open the two images you want to match.
 
 If you want, you can make selections in one or both of those images — 
for example, if you’re creating a composite image from two separate 
images and want to match the lighting color or skin tones. Without 
selections, the overall target image is matched to the source image. In 
my example in Figure 1-20, I selected an image taken outdoors in natu-
ral light and one taken inside under fluorescent lights (which give that 
image a nasty green colorcast). I want to use the girl in each image in a 
composite and therefore want to try to match the skin tones.
 Figure 1-20: The Match Color command lets you match colors within a 
single image or between two images.
 
2. Make sure your target image (the one that needs to be corrected) is 
the active file and choose Image➪Adjustments➪Match Color.
 
 If you’re using a specific layer in your target image, select that layer 
prior to choosing the command. Make sure you select the Preview 
option so that you can view your adjustments on the fly.

598
Matching Color between Documents
 
3. In the Match Color dialog box, shown in Figure 1-21, select your 
source image from the Source pop-up menu in the Image Statistics 
area.
 
 Select None if you’re working with only one image (if the source image 
and target image are the same).
 
 Remember, the source image contains the colors you want to match in 
the target image.
Figure 1-21: Match color between two images with different lighting.
 
4. If you’re using a particular layer in your source image, select it from 
the Layer pop-up menu.
 
 Or choose the Merged option to match the colors from all the layers.
 
5. If you have selections in your images, you can select one of the follow-
ing options:
 
• If you have a selection in your target image but want to match the 
colors from the whole image, select the Ignore Selection when 
Applying Adjustment option.
 
• Select the Use Selection in Source to Calculate Colors option if you 
want to use the colors in the selection in the source image to calcu-
late the adjustment. Deselect this option to ignore the selection in 
the source image and match the colors from the entire source image.

Switching Colors with Replace Color
 
• Select the Use Selection in Target to Calculate Adjustment option if 
you have a selection in the target image and want to use the colors 
in the selection to calculate the adjustment. If unselected, the adjust-
ment is calculated using the colors of the whole image.
 
6. Select the Neutralize option to remove any colorcasts in the target 
image.
 
 
When using the Match Color command, your cursor becomes the 
Eyedropper tool. This allows you to sample colors on your images and 
look at the color values in the Info panel while making your adjustments.
 
7. Adjust the luminance by moving the slider or entering a value.
 
 A higher value increases the brightness in the target image. A lower 
value decreases brightness.
 
8. Adjust the color intensity of your target image.
 
 A higher value increases the color saturation, and a lower value 
decreases the saturation. Moving the slider to 1 desaturates the image 
to grayscale.
 
9. Use the Fade option to control the amount 
of adjustment that is applied to the target 
image, moving the slider to the right to 
reduce the amount.
 
 If you move the slider all the way to the right, 
the image returns to its original colors.
 
10. If you want to save your settings to use on 
other images, click the Save Statistics button. 
Then, in the Save dialog box that appears, 
name the file, specify the location, and click 
Save.
 
 To reload the settings later, click the Load 
Statistics button and navigate to the file.
 
11. Click OK to apply the adjustment and exit 
the dialog box.
My image, shown in Figure 1-22, has less of that 
nasty green cast from the fluorescent lighting.
Switching Colors with Replace Color
The Replace Color command creates interesting creative effects by allowing 
you to substitute one set of colors for another. It builds a mask, using colors 
you select, and then replaces the selected colors with others that you spec-
ify. You can adjust hue, saturation, and lightness of the masked colors.
Figure 1-22: These tones are 
a better match with the target 
image.

600
Switching Colors with Replace Color
Just follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Image➪Adjustments➪Replace Color.
 
 The Replace Color dialog box appears, as 
shown in Figure 1-23.
 
2. Choose either Selection or Image:
 
• Selection: Shows the mask in the Preview 
window. The masked area is black, semi-
transparent areas are shades of gray, and 
unmasked areas are white.
 
 For details on masks, see Book VI, 
Chapter 2.
 
• Image: Shows the full image itself in the 
Preview window. Use this option if you 
zoomed in on the original image to select 
colors more easily, but you still want to be 
able to see the full image in the preview.
 
3. Click the colors you want to select.
 
 You can click the colors in either the image 
itself or the Preview window.
 
4. Shift-click or use the plus (+) Eyedropper 
tool to add more colors.
 
5. Press the Alt key (Option key on the Mac) and click, or use the minus 
(–) Eyedropper tool and click, to remove colors.
 
6. To add colors similar to the ones you select, use the Fuzziness slider 
to refine your selection, adding or subtracting from the selection 
based on the tolerance value.
 
 
If your selection isn’t quite cooperating, try selecting the new Localized 
Color Clusters option to assist you in obtaining a cleaner, more precise 
selection. The Localized Color Clusters option is especially handy if the 
color you’re trying to select is somewhat varied.
 
7. Move the Hue, Saturation, and Lightness sliders to change them to 
new values.
 
8. When you like the result, click OK to apply the settings.

Increasing and Decreasing Color
Increasing and decreasing color is a popular Photoshop activity, so the fact 
that Photoshop offers more than one way to do it is no surprise. In addition 
to the Selective Color command, which I describe in the following section, 
several other commands are a lot easier to understand — and a lot easier 
to use.
This is the place to start reading if you want to know all about the Gradient 
Maps command and the various color mapper tools, all of which are 
designed to change the arrangement of the colors in your photos in ways 
that don’t produce realistic-looking images. Images that have been color-
mapped are certainly interesting to look at.
Using the Selective Color command
You use the Selective Color command (in the Image➪Adjustments menu) 
chiefly to manipulate the amount of process colors (that is, cyan, magenta, 
yellow, and black) used in printing an image. In the Selective Color dialog 
box, select the color you want to edit from the Colors pop-up menu. Adjust 
the CMYK sliders to modify the selected color.
With the Relative method selected, you can add or subtract color. For exam-
ple, if a pixel is 30 percent cyan and you add 20 percent cyan, Photoshop 
adds 6 percent cyan to the pixel (20 percent of 30 percent is 6 percent).
With the Absolute method selected, Photoshop bases the amount of change 
on the exact value you enter. For example, if a pixel is 30 percent cyan and 
you add 20 percent cyan, the pixel changes to a total of 50 percent cyan.

602
Increasing and Decreasing Color
Using gradient maps
Gradient maps convert your image to grayscale and then replace the range 
of black, gray, and white tones with a gradient of your choice, in effect color-
izing your image — often, in startling ways.
Photoshop maps the lightest tones of your image to one color in the gradient 
and changes the darkest tones to the other color of the gradient (assuming 
you’re using just two colors for the gradient). Photoshop changes all the 
formerly gray tones to an intermediate color between the two. When you 
use multiple colors or fancy gradients, the image really gets interesting. Just 
follow these steps to try out this feature:
 
1. Open an image and access 
the gradient map, shown 
in Figure 1-25, by choosing 
Image➪Adjustments➪Gradient 
Map.
 
2. Choose the gradient you want 
from the gradient list.
 
 
This list is exactly like the one 
offered with the Gradient tool. You 
can edit the gradient used for your 
map exactly like you do for the Gradient tool. For more information on 
choosing gradients, see Book IV, Chapter 2.
 
3. Choose either or both of these options:
 
• Dither: Adds random noise to smooth out the gradient and reduces 
banding.
 
• Reverse: Changes the direction of the gradient. Use the Reverse 
option to create a negative quickly.
 
4. Click OK to apply the gradient map.
 
 
If the effect is a little too intense for your taste, try fading the gradient 
map (Edit➪Fade Gradient Mask) and then adjusting the opacity percent-
age and/or applying a different blend mode.
Adding color with photo filters
Photographers will appreciate the Photo Filter command, which is remi-
niscent of the analog method of placing a colored filter in front of a camera 
lens to tweak the color balance and color temperature of the light coming 
through the lens. This is a great way to make an image appear cooler or 
warmer. Have a portrait where your subject appears a little too bluish?

tones in your images with a gradient.

rosiness back into his or her cheeks. 
You can also apply a colored filter to 
add a tint of color to your image. 
Figure 1-26 shows how I warmed up an 
overly cool image.
To apply the Photo Filter adjustment, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Open your image and choose 
Image➪Adjustments➪Photo Filter 
to apply the filter to the entire 
image.
 
 If you want to apply the filter 
to one or more layers, choose 
Layer➪New Adjustment Layer➪

Filter pop-up menu or select the 
Color radio button to select a 
custom color for your filter.
 
 See Table 1-1 for a brief description of the filters in the Filter pop-up 
menu.
 
 If you opt for the custom color, click the swatch to select a color from 
the Color Picker.
 
4. Select the Preserve Luminosity check box if you don’t want the filter 
to darken your image.
 
 Note that some photo pros advocate not checking this option, but it’s up 
to you.
 
5. Adjust the Density slider to control the amount of color applied to 
your image.
 
 A higher value provides a stronger adjustment. Use the Density control 
with restraint. Anything above 50 percent produces a severe effect.
 
6. Click OK to apply the adjustment and exit the dialog box.

and Cooling Flter (80)
Adjusts the white balance in an image. A photo shot in 
a high color temperature of light makes an image blue. 
Warming Filter (85) makes the colors warmer, more 
yellow. Similarly, an image shot in light of a low color 
temperature benefits from the Cooling Filter (80), which 
makes the colors more blue.
Warming Filter (81) 
and Cooling Filter (82)
Similar to the preceding filters but for minor adjustments.
Colors
These filters adjust the hue of an image. You can select a 
color to get rid of a colorcast. For example, if your image 
is too green, select magenta. If it’s too blue, select yellow. 
You can also select a color to apply a special effect.
Playing with the color mappers
Photoshop also includes some fun-filled color mapping commands (in the 
Image➪Adjustments menu), so-called because they change the colors of your 
image in specific ways. Two of them, Invert and Equalize, don’t even have any 
options. They’re akin to single-step filters that you apply and forget. (I cover 
filters in Book VII.) I show all the color mappers in Figure 1-27.
Invert
Invert simply reverses all the colors and tones in your image, creating a neg-
ative image. Photoshop changes black tones to white, white tones to black, 
dark grays to light grays, and colors to their complements. For example, a 
light yellow color becomes a dark blue, and so forth.
 
Some folks mistakenly think they can use this command to create a posi-
tive (or color-correct) version of a scanned color negative. It isn’t so simple 
because color negatives have an orange mask overlaying the color informa-
tion. Converting a color negative correctly requires a lot of color correcting 
and tweaking. If you have sophisticated scanning software, you may have a 
command that does the conversion. A couple third-party Photoshop filters 
also do the duty. But to do it manually requires a lot of color correcting and 
tweaking. Something you may not want to try at home!
Equalize
This command locates the lightest and darkest pixels in an image, defines 
them as white and black, respectively, and then changes all the other pixels 
in between to divide the grayscale values evenly. Depending on your image, 
this process may increase contrast or otherwise alter the color and tones 
when the values are evenly distributed.

reversing colors or converting your image to black and white.
Threshold
Threshold converts your image to black and white, with all pixels that are 
brighter than a value you specify represented as white, and all pixels that 
are darker than that value as black. You can change the threshold level to 
achieve different high-contrast effects.
Posterize
This color mapper creates an interesting graphic effect by reducing the 
number of colors in your image to a value you specify, from 2 to 255. Low 
values provide distinct poster-like effects. While you increase the number of 
color levels, the image begins to look either more normal or a bit like a bad 
conversion to Indexed Color.

✓ Blurring for effect
✓ Focusing on sharpness
O
ne of the coolest things about Photoshop is the way it offers several 
tools to accomplish similar end results, but with distinctly individual-
ized looks. The focus and toning tools in Photoshop are examples of 
this. The focus tools blur, sharpen, and smudge your image 
in much the same way as the Blur, Sharpen, and Liquify 
filters (which I cover in Book VII). The toning tools 
lighten, darken, and change the richness of color in 
your image a bit like commands such as Levels, 
Curves, and Hue/Saturation (covered in Book VIII, 
Chapter 1).
But where their counterparts operate only on 
layers or selections, the focus and toning tools 
let you paint the effects you want directly onto 
your image. Using these tools, you can often 
create much more subtle, natural looks tailored to 
meet your exact needs, as I explain in this chapter.
 
While you work through this chapter, keep in mind 
all the tips I give you in Book IV, Chapter 1 about using 
brushes. Most of that information applies to the brush-like focus 
and toning tools, as well.

Lightening and Darkening with Dodge and Burn Tools
Lightening and Darkening with Dodge and Burn Tools
Dodging and burning originated in the darkroom, where photographers sal-
vage negatives containing areas that are too dark or too light by adding or 
subtracting a bit of exposure when an enlarger makes prints.
An enlarger makes a print by projecting an image of a negative onto a piece 
of photosensitive paper. During the exposure, the darkroom technician can 
reduce the amount of light falling onto the paper by placing some object 
(often a disk shape of cardboard or metal impaled on a piece of wire) in the 
light path to dodge part of the image. The worker can burn other parts of 
an image by exposing only a small portion through an opening, such as the 
fingers in a cupped pair of hands. The Dodge and Burn tools in Photoshop 
adopt their icons from those popular real-world tools used to achieve these 
effects in the darkroom.
However, the Photoshop counterparts are a great deal more flexible. For 
example, the worker in a darkroom varies the size of the dodging or burning 
tool by moving it up or down in the light path. Unfortunately, the closer the 
real-world tool gets to the paper, the sharper it appears, forcing the dark-
room worker to move the tool more rapidly and frequently to blur the edges 
of the effects. With the Photoshop Dodge and Burn tools, you can set the 
size of the tool and its softness independently simply by selecting a brush of 
the size and with the hardness or softness you require.
You can also set the Photoshop tools to operate primarily on shadows, mid-
tones, and highlights. You can adjust the degree of lightening and darkening 
applied by specifying an exposure, too.
 
The Dodge (used to lighten) and Burn (used to darken) tools can be very 
effective tools, but you can’t add detail that isn’t there. Keep the following in 
mind:
 
✓ When you lighten very dark shadows that contain little detail, you end 
up with grayish shadows.
 
✓ Darkening very light areas that are completely washed out doesn’t look 
very good, either.
In either case, you want to use the Dodge and Burn tools in moderation and 
work only with small areas. To dodge or burn a portion of an image, just 
follow these steps:

609
Book VIII
Chapter 2
Repairing 
with Focus and 
Toning Tools
Lightening and Darkening with Dodge and Burn Tools
 
1. Open an image with under- or overexposed areas and select the 
Dodge or Burn tool from the Tools panel.
 
 Press the O key to choose the active toning tool or press Shift+O to 
cycle through the available toning tools until the one you want is active.
 
2. In the Options bar, make these 
adjustments:
 
a. Select a brush from the 
Brushes panel.
 
 Larger, softer brushes spread 
the dodging and burning effect 
over a larger area, making 
blending with the surrounding 
area easier.
 
 You can choose the same 
brushes available with any 
of the painting tools, includ-
ing preset brushes from your 
library.
 
b. Under the Range options, 
select Shadows, Midtones, or 
Highlights.
 
 Use Shadows to lighten or 
darken detail in the darker 
areas of your image, Midtones 
to adjust the tones of average 
darkness, and Highlights to 
make the brightest areas even 
lighter or (more frequently) 
darker.
 
 In Figure 2-1, the original image 
(top) had mostly dark areas, 
so I dodged the shadows. Note 
the increased detail in the eyes, 
teeth, and hair. I also gave a 
couple swipes to the highlight 
areas with the Burn tool.
Figure 2-1: The Dodge and Burn tools are 
effective when touching up smaller dark and 
light areas.

Turning Down the Color with the Sponge Tool
 
c. Select the amount of the effect to apply with each stroke by using 
the Exposure slider or text box.
 
d. Check the Protect Tones option.
 
 This new setting provides more natural and subtle dodging and burn-
ing results by preserving the hues and tones of the image pixels.
 
3. Paint over the areas you want to lighten or darken with the toning 
brush, gradually building up the desired effect.
 
 Using a soft-edged brush is often best when dodging and burning. You 
want to create a realistic, not retouched, appearance.
 
 The Exposure control is similar to the Opacity control offered by other 
painting tools, but it’s especially important with dodging and burning.
 
 
Using a low value is best (I often work with 10-percent exposure or less) 
so that you can carefully paint in the lightening or darkening you want.
 
 High exposure values work too quickly and produce unnatural-looking, 
obviously dodged or burned areas in your images.
 
 
For an even softer, more gradual effect, click the Airbrush icon on the 
Options bar.
 
4. If you go too far, press Ctrl+Z (Ô+Z on the Mac) to reverse your most 
recent stroke.
 
5. When you finish, choose File➪Save to store the image.
Turning Down the Color with the Sponge Tool
The Sponge tool, which soaks up color like, well, a sponge, reduces the 
richness or intensity (or saturation) of a color in the areas you paint. It can 
also perform the reverse, imbuing a specific area with richer, more vibrant 
colors.
Surprisingly, the Sponge tool also works in grayscale mode, pushing light 
and dark pixels toward a middle gray, providing a darkening or lightening 
effect to those pixels. Unlike the Hue/Saturation or Desaturate commands 
(Image➪Adjustments), which work only on layers or selections, you can use 
the Sponge tool on any area that you can paint with a brush.
You can use the Sponge tool on an image in subtle ways to reduce the satu-
ration in selected areas for an interesting effect. For example, you may have 
an object that’s the center of attention in your picture simply because the 

611
Book VIII
Chapter 2
Repairing 
with Focus and 
Toning Tools
Turning Down the Color with the Sponge Tool
colors are so bright (or even garish). The Sponge tool lets you reduce the 
color saturation of that area (and only that area) to allow the other sections 
of your image to come to the forefront. You can also use the Sponge tool to 
make an artistic statement: You could reduce or increase the saturation of 
a single person in a group shot to make that person stand out (perhaps as 
being more colorful than the rest).
To use the Sponge tool, just follow these steps:
 
1. Open an image and select the Sponge tool from the Tools panel.
 
 Press the O key to choose the Sponge if it’s the active toning tool or 
press Shift+O to cycle through the Sponge, Dodge, and Burn tools until 
the Sponge tool is active.
 
2. In the Options bar, make the following changes:
 
a. Select a brush from the Brushes panel.
 
 Use large, soft brushes to saturate/desaturate a larger area.
 
 Smaller brushes are useful mostly when you need to change the satu-
ration of a specific small object in an image.
 
b. Select either Desaturate (reduce color richness) or Saturate 
(increase color richness) from the Mode pop-up menu.
 
c. Select a flow rate (the speed with which the saturation/desatura-
tion effect builds up while you apply the brush) with the Flow 
slider or text box.
 
d. If you want an even softer effect, select the Airbrush icon.
 
e. Check the Vibrance option.
 
 
This great new setting allows saturation for each color to reach its 
fullest level, but the setting stops saturation after that point to avoid 
clipping (when colors fall outside the printable range). At the same 
time, it allows saturation to continue for any colors that haven’t 
reach the clipping point.
 
3. Paint carefully over the areas you want to saturate or desaturate with 
color.
 
 In Figure 2-2, I saturated the little girl to make her more a focal point and 
desaturated the parents and surroundings.

Smoothing with the Smudge Tool
Purestock
Figure 2-2: The Sponge tool saturates (increases richness) and desaturates (decreases richness) 
color.
Smoothing with the Smudge Tool
Although grouped among the focus tools, the Smudge tool performs more of 
a warping effect, something like the Warp tool in the Liquify dialog box (see 
Book VII, Chapter 3 for information on this command).
Smudge pushes your pixels around on the screen as if they consisted of 
wet paint, using the color that’s under the cursor when you start to stroke. 
However, don’t view the Smudge tool as a simple distortion tool that pro-
duces only comical effects. I use it on tiny areas of an image to soften the 
edges of objects in a way that often looks more natural than blurring tools. 
The Smudge tool can come in handy when retouching images to create a 
soft, almost painted look, as shown in Figure 2-3. Just don’t go too gung-ho, 
or you may obliterate detail that you want to preserve.
 
Smudged areas may be obvious because of their smooth appearance. Adding 
a little texture by using the Noise filter after you smudge is often a good idea 
if you want to blend a smudged section in with its surroundings. You can 
find tips on applying the Noise filter in Book VII, Chapter 2.

Smoothing with the Smudge Tool
To apply the Smudge tool, just follow 
these steps:
 
1. Open the image and select the 
Smudge tool from the Tools 
panel.
 
2. Select the settings you want from 
the Options bar:
 
a. Select a brush from the 
Brushes panel.
 
 Use a small brush for smudg-
ing tiny areas, such as edges. 
Larger brushes produce drastic 
effects, so use them with care.
 
b. Select a blending mode from 
the Mode pop-up menu.
 
c. Select the strength of the 
smudging effect with the 
Strength slider or text box.
 
 Low values produce a lighter 
smudging effect; high values 
really push your pixels around.
 
d. If your image has multiple 
layers and you want Photoshop to use the color information from 
all the visible layers to produce the smudge effect, select the 
Sample All Layers option.
 
 The smudge still appears only on the active layer, but the look is a 
bit different, depending on the contents of the underlying layers.
 
3. Use the Finger Painting option to begin the smudge by using the fore-
ground color.
 
 You can get some interesting effects with this option.
 
 
You can switch the Smudge tool into Finger Painting mode temporarily 
by holding down the Alt key (the Option key on the Mac) while you drag.
 
4. Paint over the areas you want to smudge.
 
5. Watch the screen carefully while you smudge so that you can redirect 
your daubs to achieve the look you want.
 
 
This tool can be a little on the destructive side. If you’re looking to pre-
serve reality, use it with restraint. If you want to get wild, go crazy.
 
6. When you finish, choose File➪Save to store your image.

Softening with the Blur Tool
Softening with the Blur Tool
Adding a little blur here and there 
can save an image with a few defects. 
Blurring can also be used for artistic 
effect — say, to add a little motion to 
a soccer ball frozen in time by a too-
fast shutter speed. You can also blur 
portions of your image to emphasize 
and focus on a particular element, as 
shown in Figure 2-4, where I blurred 
the flowers a bit to draw attention 
to the butterfly. The Photoshop Blur 
tool makes painting your blur effects 
exactly where you want them easy.
The Blur tool doesn’t push pixels around 
like the Smudge tool does. Instead, the 
Blur tool decreases the contrast among 
adjacent pixels in the area painted.
The mechanics of using the Blur tool 
and several of its options are similar to 
those of the Smudge tool (which I talk 
about in the preceding section). Just 
follow these steps:
 
1. Open an image and select the Blur tool from the Tools panel.
 
2. In the Options bar, specify these settings:
 
a. Select a brush from the Brushes panel.
 
 Use a small brush for applying small areas of blur.
 
 
Use larger brushes with caution to, for example, blur the entire back-
ground to make a foreground object appear sharper in comparison.
 
b. Select a blending mode from the Mode pop-up menu.
 
c. Select the strength of the blurring effect with the Strength slider or 
text box.
 
d. If your image has multiple layers and you want to blur based on 
the pixel information in all the visible layers in your image, select 
the Use All Layers option.
 
 Selecting this option can produce a smoother blur when you merge 
the layers later.
 
3. Paint over the areas you want to blur.
 
4. When you finish, choose File➪Save to store your image.

Cranking Up the Focus with the Sharpen Tool
Cranking Up the Focus with the Sharpen Tool
In theory, the Sharpen tool is nothing more than the Blur tool (discussed in 
the preceding section) in reverse — instead of decreasing contrast among 
pixels, the Sharpen tool increases the contrast. In practice, however, you 
need to use this tool with a bit more care than the Blur tool. Where blurred 
areas tend to fade from a viewer’s 
notice (at least, in terms of how his 
or her eyes perceive them), sharp-
ened areas of an image jump out at 
people.
If you blur an area a little too much, 
you may not even notice. But even 
a small area that has been over-
sharpened can change the entire 
appearance of an image — and not 
flatteringly.
You can often successfully sharpen 
small areas with the Sharpen tool. 
Sometimes, the eyes in a portrait 
can benefit from a little sharpening, 
as shown in Figure 2-5. Or you might 
want to sharpen an area to make it 
stand out more distinctly against a 
slightly blurred background.
Follow these simple steps to use the Sharpen tool:
 
1. Select the Sharpen tool from the Tools panel.
 
2. Make the following changes in the Options bar:
 
a. Select the brush of your choice from the Brushes panel.
 
b. Select a blending mode from the Mode pop-up menu.
 
c. Select the strength of the sharpening effect with the Strength slider 
or text box.
 
 
Using a fairly low value (say, 25 percent or less) is a good idea because 
you can build up sharpness slowly, being careful not to overdo it.
 
 You know you’ve gone too far with the sharpness when the pixels 
start to look noisy and grainy.
 
d. Use the information on all your layers for Photoshop’s contrast-
increasing algorithms by selecting the Use All Layers option.
 
3. Paint over the areas you want to sharpen.
 
4. When you finish, choose File➪Save to store your image.

Figure 2-5: Use the Sharpen tool sparingly 
and in small areas, such as in the eyes of this 
portrait.

616
Cranking Up the Focus with the Sharpen Tool
 
Sharpening increases contrast, so be careful when using the Sharpen tool 
if you plan to also adjust the Levels or Curves controls. Any change that 
increases contrast in the whole image also boosts the contrast of an area 
you’ve sharpened.
 
The Unsharp Mask and Smart Sharpen filters offer more options and better 
overall control, so unless you really need to paint the sharpening effect, 
you’re usually better off using a filter. If you really want to apply the effect 
with brushstrokes, you can always apply the Unsharp Mask filter to a whole 
layer, take a snapshot, undo the filter operation, and then use the snapshot 
as a source to paint from, using the History panel. See Book II, Chapter 4 for 
information on how to paint from the History panel. Finally, for the maxi-
mum flexibility, try using Smart Filters, which enable you to endlessly edit 
your filter. For more on Smart Filters, see Book VII, Chapter 1.
Putting It Together
Fixing an Underexposed Foreground
Sometimes, editing tools just don’t cut the mustard when it comes to ﬁ xing large areas of 
an underexposed image. Instead, you have to use three tools together to repair the dam-
age: a ﬁ lter, a ﬁ ll, and a blend mode.
If you’re like me, you’ve taken at least a couple of photos where your subject was lit from 
behind, thereby underexposing the foreground and burying the subject in the shadows. 
You can try the Shadow and Highlight adjustment, on the Image➪Adjustments menu, 
which usually does a good job of ﬁ xing the problem. But if you’re not satisﬁ ed with that 
adjustment, you can follow this old-school method. Or you can even go for a combo plate 
and use them both. Follow these steps to bring your subject back into the light:
 
1. Open the image in need of repair.
 
2. Choose Image➪Duplicate.
 
3. In the dialog box that appears, 
name the duplicate ﬁ le Repair 
and click OK.
 
4. On the duplicate image, choose 
Image➪Mode➪Grayscale. Click 
Discard in the dialog box that 
appears to discard the color 
information.

 Photoshop has now stripped the color from the image. Don’t worry; this is just an 
intermediary step.
 
5. On the duplicate image, choose Filter➪Blur➪Gaussian Blur. In the Gaussian Blur 
dialog box, enter a radius value and click OK.
 
 For a low resolution image (72 ppi), 5 pixels is enough. For higher resolution images 
(300 ppi), use 20 pixels. Your goal is to get rid of the detail in the image.
 
6. Return to the original image and choose Select➪Load Selection.
 
 In the Load Selection dialog box, make sure the Document drop-down list says 
Repair.
 
7. Select Gray for the Channel. Select 
the Invert box. In the Operation area, 
leave the setting as New Selection, 
as shown in the ﬁ gure. Click OK to 
load the selection.
 
 You’re loading the only available 
channel in the duplicate grayscale 
image as a selection.
 
 A selection outline appears, which 
corresponds to the blurry gray areas 
in your duplicate image.
 
8. Choose Edit➪Fill.
 
9. In the Fill dialog box that appears, 
shown in the ﬁ gure, select 50% Gray 
from the Use pop-up menu. Select 
Color Dodge from the Mode pop-up 
menu. Leave the Opacity at 100%. 
Click OK.
 
 Although Photoshop ﬁ lls the selection 
with 50-percent gray, the Color Dodge 
mode lightens the pixels in the image, 
creating a kind of bleaching effect.

S
ay that you want to duplicate an element in 
your image. That’s easy enough, right? Make 
a selection and copy and paste it into the new 
location. Presto. That works fine most of the time. 
But what if the element has a shadow behind it,

better method is to clone the element by using the 
Clone Stamp tool. It’s quick, easy, and no one will 
know that only one element was there originally.
Here’s another hypothetical situation: What if 
some unsightly flaw mars your otherwise perfect 
image? Or maybe the corporate executive, whose 
head shot you took last week, has requested a 
little digital Botox around the eyes and mouth. 
In this chapter, I reveal secrets of cloning that 
won’t make medical ethicists scream. I show you 
how to heal scars, scratches, and other imperfections without calling a plas-
tic surgeon. And you can now use Vanishing Point to add or remove 
windows or doors without forking out a dime to a contractor.

Cloning with the Clone Stamp Tool
Cloning with the Clone Stamp Tool
The Clone Stamp tool, one of Photoshop’s more popular tools, always 
arouses a “Wow,” “Cool,” or similar remark of approval when demonstrated.
Believe it or not, you can also reach for this tool when retouching imperfec-
tions such as scratches, scars, bruises, and other minor flaws. In fact, that 
used to be one of its major functions. In some retouching instances, it does a 
great job, although the advent of the Healing Brush and Patch tools has rel-
egated the Clone Stamp tool more to the pure cloning functions and less to 
the hard-core retouching jobs.
Using the Clone Stamp tool
The Clone Stamp tool works its magic by taking sampled pixels from one 
area and cloning (or copying) them onto another area. Cloning often works 
better than making a selection, then copying and pasting it, because clon-
ing allows you to retain soft edges on details such as shadows, giving you 
a more realistic duplicate image. To assist you with your cloning tasks, the 
Clone Source panel enables you to see a preview (in an overlay style) of the 
source pixels you’re cloning.
Follow these steps to clone an element without any genetic engineering:
 
 1. Open an image and select the Clone Stamp tool from the Tools panel.
 
Press the S key (or Shift+S if the Pattern Stamp is currently active) on 
the keyboard.
 
 You have several options to choose from on the Options bar.
 
2. Select a brush and change its size or hardness in the Brush Preset 
Picker drop-down panel to better control the area that you’re cloning.
 
 For more information on brushes, see Book IV, Chapter 1.
 
 I recommend having your Clone Stamp tool cursor display your Full Size 
Brush Tip so you can judge the amount of the area you’re cloning. To do so, 
choose Edit➪Preferences➪Cursors (Photoshop➪Preferences➪Cursors on 
the Mac). Select the Full Size Brush Tip radio button in the Painting Cursors 
area of the dialog box.
 
 I used a 65-pixel, feathered brush.
 
3. Select the blend mode of your choice in the Options bar.
 
 Selecting a mode such as Difference, Multiply, or Color can produce 
some interesting special effects. For more on modes, see Book V, 
Chapter 3. I left my setting at Normal.

621

4. To make the clone more or less opaque, use the Opacity slider or text 
box on the Options bar.
 
 I left the opacity at 100%.
 
5. Specify how fast the Clone Stamp tool applies the clone by adjusting 
the Flow Rate percentage.
 
 Again, I left my option at 100%.
 
6. Select the Airbrush option for Airbrushing capabilities, if so desired.
 
7. Select or deselect the Aligned option, depending on your preference.
 
 With Aligned selected, the clone source moves when you move your 
cursor to a different location. If you want to clone multiple times from 
the same location, deselect the Aligned option. I left mine selected.
 
8. Select the All Layers option from the Sample option drop-down list to 
clone part of an image with multiple layers.
 
 Selecting this option enables you to sample pixels in all the visible layers 
for the clone. If you select the Current Layer option, the Clone Stamp 
tool clones only from the active layer. And if you select the Current and 
Below option, you sample pixels from the current layer and all layers 
below it.
 
9. If you select All Layers in Step 9, you can choose whether or not 
to ignore any Adjustment Layers when cloning. To do so, click the 
Adjustment layer icon in the Options bar.
 
 By ignoring Adjustment Layers, you may prevent the bizarre results that 
can sometimes occur by double-applying your adjustment layers during 
the cloning process.
 
10. Choose Window➪Clone Source to open the Clone Source panel, as 
shown in Figure 3-1. Specify the following options:
 
• Sampling Sources: In Step 12, you define a sampling source by Alt-
clicking (Option-clicking on the Mac) the area of the image that you 
want to clone. However, if you want to create multiple sampling 
sources, you can do so in the Clone Source panel by selecting a dif-
ferent Clone Source button and repeating this Alt-clicking (Option-
clicking on the Mac) process on other areas of your image. You 
probably don’t need to use more than one source. Multiple sampling 
sources are useful for video editors who have to work with tight reg-
istration between frames that need cloning.
 
• Transformations: Adjust the rotation, position, or scale of your 
clone. Select the link icon to maintain your Width (W) and Height 
(H) aspect ratio. Click the small curved arrow below the link icon to 
reset your transformation settings (W, H and rotation). I wanted my 

622
Cloning with the Clone Stamp Tool
cloned tiger to be a twin of the one that’s already in the image, so I 
left the settings at their default.
 
 You can use scrubby sliders by hovering over the transformation 
label (H, W, and so on) of a 
field and dragging left or right. 
Hold down Alt (Option on the 
Mac) while dragging to make 
your changes slower. Hold 
down Shift while dragging to 
make your changes faster.
 
• Overlay: If desired, select 
the Show Overlay option. 
Applying an overlay is espe-
cially useful when cloning 
subjects that need to be in 
alignment with the underly-
ing image. Adjust the Opacity 
to your desired percentage. 
I used 30% in my example. 
If you want, check the Auto-
Hide option. If you select this 
option, when you release your 
mouse, you see a ghosted 
preview of how your cloned 
pixels will appear on the 
image. While you’re painting, however, the overlay is hidden. Select 
a blend mode for your overlay from the blend mode drop-down list. 
Depending on your source pixels, a blend mode other than Normal 
may work better in aligning your cloned image with the underlying 
image. Check Invert to reverse the colors and tones in your overlay. 
This setting may also assist you in aligning areas.
 
 
To temporarily display the overlay, hold down Alt+Shift-click 
(Option+Shift-click on the Mac) after setting your source. Note that 
you can drag your overlay around and then, after you have your 
desired location, release the mouse to set it down.
 
 
You can find most of the same options in the Clone Source panel 
pop-up menu.
 
 
 
If you select the new Clipped option, the overlay is clipped, or con-
tained, only within the boundaries of your brush. In my opinion, this 
makes it a lot easier to clone exactly what you want.
 
11. Alt-click (Option-click on the Mac) the area of your image that you 
want to clone.

you move the mouse, the 
crosshair moves, as well. This 
provides a continuous refer-
ence to the area of your image 
that you’re cloning. Keep an 
eye on the crosshair, or you 
may clone something you 
don’t want. Try to clone your 
entire object in one fell swoop 
so it doesn’t get fragmented.
 
 When you successfully com-
plete the cloning process, you 
have two identical objects. 
Figure 3-3 shows my identical 
twin Siberian tigers.

Tips for excellent cloning results
Here are a few useful tidbits regarding the Clone Stamp tool:
 
✓ Use the Clone Stamp tool to fix simple flaws. To clean up a flaw that’s 
pretty straight, such as a stray hair or scratch, Alt-click (Option-click on 
the Mac) with the tool to define the source. Then, click at one end of the 
straight flaw and Shift-click at the other end. The cloned source pixels 
then cover up the flaw.
 
✓ Pay attention to the origin point for sampling. Depending on what you’re 
cloning (for example, when covering up a flaw), if you keep sampling from 
the same point without ever varying it, the area you’re cloning starts to

look like ugly shag carpeting. Or, at best, starts to appear blotchy and 
over-retouched.
 
✓ Zoom out once in a while to check how your image looks overall. 
Doing so helps you avoid those funky telltale clone stamp repetitive pat-
terns and blotches.
 
✓ When cloning patterns, use the Pattern Stamp tool, which shares the 
flyout menu with the Clone Stamp tool. Select a custom pattern from 
the Pattern Picker drop-down panel on the Options bar. Drag with the 
Pattern Stamp tool, and you see the pattern appear.
Digital Bandaging with the Healing Brush Tool
The Healing Brush and Patch tools are similar to the Clone Stamp tool. They 
let you clone pixels from one area and apply them to another area. But that’s 
where the similarities end, and the healing tools leave the Clone Stamp tool 
eating their dust.
The problem with the Clone Stamp tool is that it doesn’t take the tonality of 
the flawed area — the shadows, midtones, and highlights — into consider-
ation. So, if the pixels you’re sampling from aren’t shaded and lit exactly like 
the ones you’re covering, you have a mismatch in color, which makes seam-
less and indecipherable repairs hard to achieve.
That’s where the Healing Brush tool comes in. This very intelligent tool 
clones by using the texture from the sampled area (the source) and then 
using the colors around the brush stroke when you paint over the flawed 
area (the destination). The highlights, midtones, and shadows remain intact, 
and the result of the repair is more realistic and natural — not retouched 
and phony. Follow these steps to heal your favorite, but imperfect, photo:
 
 
1. Open your image and select the Healing Brush tool.
 
My guy, shown in Figure 3-4, looks like he could stand to get some “work 
done,” as they say in Hollywood. Note that you can also heal between 
two images. Just make sure that they have the same color mode.
 
2. On the Options bar, click the Brush Preset Picker.
 
 In the drop-down panel, select your desired diameter and hardness, as 
well as spacing, angle and roundness if you want, for your brush tip. You 
will most likely specify your brush settings several times while retouch-
ing your image. Using the appropriate brush size for the flaw you’re 
repairing is important.
 
3. In the Options bar, leave the blend mode set to Normal.

625

Chapter 3
Fixing Flaws and 
Removing What’s 
Not Wanted
Digital Bandaging with the Healing Brush Tool
 
 You can change your blend mode, 
if necessary. The Replace mode 
preserves textures, such as noise 
or film grain, around the edges 
of your strokes when using a soft 
brush. For most simple retouch-
ing jobs, such as this one, you can 
leave it at Normal.
 
4. Select a Source option.
 
 You have a choice between 
Sampled and Pattern:
 
• Sampled: You’ll probably use 
this option, which uses the 
pixels from the image, 99 per-
cent of the time.
 
• Pattern: Well, you can prob-
ably infer that it uses pixels 
from a pattern you select from 
the Pattern Picker drop-down 
panel.
 
 For my example, I’m sticking with 
Sampled because I don’t think my 
guy would look that good with a 
Tie-Dye or Nebula pattern across his 
face. He’s just way too corporate for that.
 
5. Select how you want to align the sampled pixels.
 
 When you click or drag with the Healing Brush tool, Photoshop displays 
a crosshair along with the Healing Brush cursor. The crosshair repre-
sents the sampling point, also known as the source. While you move 
the Healing Brush tool, the crosshair also moves, providing a constant 
reference to the area that you’re sampling. However, if you deselect the 
Aligned option on the Options bar, Photoshop applies the source pixels 
from your original sampling point, despite how many times you stop and 
start dragging. I left the Aligned option selected in my example.
 
6. Select the All Layers option from the Sample drop-down panel to heal 
an image by using all visible layers. Select Current Layer if you want 
to heal only from the active layer. Choose Current Layer and Below to 
heal from your active layer and all layers beneath it.
 
 
Note that you can use the Clone Source panel with the Healing tools, as 
well as with the Clone Stamp tool. For details, see the section “Cloning 
with the Clone Stamp tool,” earlier in this chapter.
Figure 3-4: The Healing Brush can make 
these wrinkles practically disappear.

626
Patching without Seams
 
 For maximum flexibility, select the Sample All Layers option and, in the 
Layers panel, add a new, blank layer above the image you want to heal. 
Select this blank layer and when you heal the image, the pixels appear 
on the new layer and not on the image itself. You can then adjust opac-
ity, blend modes, and make other tweaks to the “healed” pixels.
 
7. If you selected All Layers in Step 5, you can choose whether to ignore 
any Adjustment Layers when healing.
 
 By ignoring Adjustment Layers, you may prevent the bizarre results that 
can sometimes occur when your Adjustment Layers get double-applied 
during the healing process. To do so, click the Adjustment layer icon in 
the Options bar.
 
8. Establish the sampling point by Alt-clicking (Option-clicking on the 
Mac).
 
 Make sure to click the area of your 
image you want to clone from.
 
 In my example, I clicked the 
smooth area on the chin and por-
tions of the forehead.
 
9. Release the Alt (Option on the 
Mac) key and click or drag over 
the area of your image that con-
tains the flaw.
 
 Pay attention to where the cross-
hair is located because that’s the 
area you’re sampling from.
 
 In my example, I brushed over 
the wrinkles under and around 
the eyes and on the forehead, as 
shown in Figure 3-5. I also zapped 
some dark spots here and there. 
Save the file, close it, and send 
in your invoice for your digital 
dermabrasion.
Patching without Seams
Although the Patch tool is similar to the Healing Brush tool in theory, its 
application method is slightly different. Instead of painting over the flaws 
with a brush, you select your flawed area and apply a patch to that selection.

gentleman lost about ten years.

Patching without Seams
 
The Patch tool does a good job in fixing larger 
flawed areas or isolated imperfections, rather 
than a few wrinkles or scars here and there. 
What’s more, it’s a breeze to use.
Follow these steps to patch an area in need of 
repair:
 
1. Open your image and select the Patch tool.
 
 It looks like a patch of material. The girl in 
my image, shown in Figure 3-6, is virtually 
flawless, although I can’t say the same for 
the wall she’s leaning against.
 
2. Select Source or Destination on the 
Options bar.
 
 Select Source if you want to select the 
flawed area. Select Destination if you want to 
select the good area you want to clone from.
 
 Select the Transparent option to patch from your source pixels with less 
opaqueness.
 
 You can use the Clone Source panel with 
the Patch tool. For details, see the section 
“Cloning with the Clone Stamp tool,” earlier 
in this chapter.
 
3. Drag around the flawed area of your 
image.
 
 Think of the Patch tool as a kind of super-
cloning Lasso tool. Drag completely around 
the flawed area like you would when select-
ing with the Lasso tool. If you need to, you 
can apply a slight feather of 0.5 to 2 pixels, 
depending on the resolution, to soften the 
edge of the selection. I selected my area with-
out a feather, as shown in Figure 3-7.
 
 You can actually select your flawed area with any selection tool you like. 
If you use another selection tool, after you have your selection, then 
select the Patch tool and proceed to Step 4.
 
 Once you’ve made a selection you can also select a pattern from the 
drop-down menu and click the Use Pattern button. This will fill your 
selected area with that chosen pattern. 
Figure 3-6: The Patch tool can 
fix the flaws on the wall.
Figure 3-7: Drag around the 
flawed area.

Zeroing In with the Spot Healing Brush
 
4. Drag your selection to the area on your 
image that you want to clone (or sample) 
from, as shown in Figure 3-8.
 
5. When you release the mouse button, 
Photoshop patches your flawed selection 
with the cloned pixels.
 
6. Repeat the process, as needed.
 
 After several patches, the wall now looks 
almost as good as the girl, as shown in 
Figure 3-9.
Zeroing In with the Spot 
Healing Brush
Whereas the Healing Brush is designed to fix 
larger flawed areas, the Spot Healing Brush is 
designed for smaller blemishes and little imper-
fections. The biggest difference between the 
Healing Brush and the Spot Healing Brush is that 
the Spot Healing Brush doesn’t require you to 
specify a sampling source. It automatically takes 
a sample from around the area to be retouched. 
The good news is it’s quick and easy. The down-
side is that it doesn’t give you as much control 
over the sampling source. Consequently, reserve 
this tool for small and simple flaws. Follow these 
steps to quickly fix little, nitpicky imperfections 
with the Spot Healing Brush tool:
 
1. Open your image and grab the Spot 
Healing Brush tool.
 
 The small moles in Figure 3-10 are examples of small areas you can fix 
with the Spot Healing brush.
 
2. On the Options bar, click the Brush Preset Picker and select your 
desired diameter, hardness and other options for your brush tip.
 
 Try to select a brush that’s a little larger than the flawed area.
 
3. Select a blend mode from the Options bar.
 
 Like the Healing Brush, you can select the Replace mode. Most likely, 
the Normal mode will work the best.

the area you want to sample.

4. Select a type from the Options 
bar.
 
 You have a choice between 
Proximity Match and Create 
Texture:
 
• Proximity Match: Samples 
the pixels around the edge 
of the selection to use to fix 
the flawed area
 
• Create Texture: Uses all 
the pixels in the selection 
to create a texture to fix the 
flaw
 
 Try Proximity Match first and, if it doesn’t work, undo and try Create 
Texture.
 
5. Choose Sample All Layers to heal an image by using all visible layers.
 
 If you leave this option unselected, you heal only from the active layer.
 
6. Click, or click and drag, the 
area you want to fix.
 
 In Figure 3-11, I used the Spot 
Healing Brush for the moles 
and spots on the upper lip and 
cheeks. But for the mole over 
the eyebrow, I broke out the 
Healing Brush. I found I needed 
more control of the sampling 
source because the mole is so 
close to the hair of the eyebrow.
Colorizing with the Color 
Replacement Tool
The Color Replacement tool allows you to replace the original color of an 
image with the foreground color. You can use this tool in a variety of ways. 
Create the look of a hand-painted photo by colorizing a grayscale image. Or 
maybe you just want to change the color of an object or two, such as a couple 
of flowers in a bouquet. And although Photoshop has a bona-fide Red Eye tool, 
you can also use the Color Replacement tool to easily paint away red eye.
PhotoSpin

the Healing Brush to remove a few moles.

630
Colorizing with the Color Replacement Tool
 
The great thing about the Color Replacement tool is that, like the other heal-
ing tools, it completely preserves the tonality of the image. The color that 
you apply doesn’t obliterate the midtones, shadows, and highlights like it 
would if you were using the regular Brush tool. The Color Replacement tool 
works by first sampling the original colors in the image and then replacing 
those colors with the foreground color. By specifying different sampling 
methods, limits, and tolerance settings, you can control the range of colors 
that Photoshop replaces.
This weapon in the arsenal of retouching tools is a cinch to use. Follow these 
steps to replace color:
 
 1. Open your image and select the Color Replacement tool.
 
 
 Remember, it shares a flyout menu with the regular Brush and Pencil 
tools.
 
 It looks like a brush with a square and two arrows next to it. You can 
press B (or Shift+B) to select it.
 
2. On the Options bar, click the Brush Preset Picker.
 
 In the drop-down panel that appears, select your desired diameter, hard-
ness and other options for your brush tip.
 
3. In the Options bar, select your desired blend mode:
 
• Color: The default mode that works well for most colorizing jobs. 
Use this mode if you’re trying to get rid of red eye.
 
• Hue: Similar to color, but less intense, providing a lighter effect.
 
• Saturation: Set your foreground color to Black in the Tools panel and 
set the mode to Saturation to convert a color image to grayscale.
 
• Luminosity: The exact opposite of the Color mode. Although it can 
create a beautiful effect between two image layers, it doesn’t provide 
that great an effect with this tool.
 
 For a full “scientific” definition of each blend mode, check out Book 
IV, Chapter 1.
 
4. Select your sampling method from the icons in the Options bar.
 
 The default of Continuous allows you to sample and replace color con-
tinuously while you drag your mouse. Select Once to replace colors only 
in areas containing the color that you first sample. And finally, select 
Background Swatch to replace colors only in areas containing your cur-
rent Background color.
 
5. Select your sampling limits mode.
 
 The default of Contiguous lets you replace the color of pixels contain-
ing the sampled color that are adjacent to each other directly under the 
brush. Discontiguous lets you replace the color of the pixels containing

 the sampled color wherever it 
occurs under your brush. And 
Find Edges allows you to replace 
the color of pixels containing the 
sampled color while preserving 
the sharpness of the edges of the 
objects.
 
6. Specify your tolerance percentage.
 
 Tolerance refers to a range of 
color. A high tolerance lets you 
replace a broad range of color. A 
low tolerance limits the replace-
ment of color to only areas that are 
similar to the sampled color.
 
7. Choose whether you want anti-
aliasing.
 
 Remember, anti-aliasing slightly 
softens and smoothes the edge of 
the selected or sampled areas.
 
8. After you establish your settings, 
click or drag in your image.
 
 Notice how the foreground color, 
which in my example is black, replaces the original colors of the sam-
pled areas (see Figure 3-12). Of course, the exact effect you get depends 
on your settings.
Getting Rid of Dreaded Red Eye
Red eye occurs when the subject of a picture looks directly into the flash, 
and the unfortunate result is that eerie reddish luminescence in the eyes 
that says, “I may very well be a demon child.”
Many cameras have a red-eye prevention mode, but that’s little solace when 
you have a great picture that features bright red pupils as its most dominat-
ing feature. If you’ve been hanging around in Photoshop for a while, you’re 
probably aware that you can get the same result many different ways. This 
holds true for getting rid of red eye, as well. You can use the regular old 
Brush tool with a Color blend mode and paint away the red. Or you can use 
the Color Replacement tool with a black foreground to color away the crim-
son. Finally, you can use the Red Eye tool.

Working with Vanishing Point
Follow these steps for a quick way to 
get the red out and restore your image 
to a less zombie-like look:
 
1. Open the original photo with red 
eye showing.
 
 I’m using a photo of an unhappy 
angel, shown in Figure 3-13.
 
2. Select the Red Eye tool.
 
 Using the default settings, click 
the red portion of the eye in your 
image, as shown in Figure 3-14. 
This one-click tool darkens the 
pupil, while retaining the tonality 
and texture of the eye.
 
3. If you’re not happy with the 
results, tweak one or both of the 
following options:
 
• Pupil Size: Use the slider to 
increase or decrease the size of 
the pupil.
 
• Darken Pupil: Use the slider to 
darken or lighten the color of 
the pupil.
 
4. If all goes well, your image is now 
cured of the dreaded red eye, as 
shown in Figure 3-15.
 
The Red Eye tool works only with RGB 
or Lab color images. For details on 
these color modes, see Book II.
Working with Vanishing Point
This awesome command enables you 
to make realistic edits in images that 
have perspective planes. With Vanishing 
Point, you specify the planes in your 
images and then, by using a variety of techniques such as painting or clon-
ing, can add or eliminate objects on those planes.
For example, say you have a building that has only one window on the side. 
You have a remodeling project in mind in which you want to add more light 
Figure 3-13: This photo needs an exorcist.
Figure 3-14: Click the red eye with the Red 
Eye tool to make it vanish.

in the room, so you want to add three more windows on that side. Using 
Vanishing Point, you can easily add those windows, all of which will be scaled 
and angled by staying true to the perspective of the side of that building. 
 
Besides editing flaws out or features into your digital photos, other great 
uses for Vanishing Point include mocking up covers for books or DVDs, and 
putting graphics on various packaging containers.
Follow these steps to use this incredible feature:
 
1. Open an image that needs editing.
 
 Creating a new layer is a good idea so that you can isolate your 
Vanishing Point result from your original image layer. You get further 
editing advantages by adding a layer if you want to change opacity set-
tings, blend modes, and so on.
 
 If you want the Vanishing Point results to only be applied to a specific 
part of your image, be sure to make the selection (or add a mask) before 
selecting the Vanishing Point command.
 
 
If you need to paste an element into the Vanishing Point dialog box, be 
sure to copy the item before selecting the Vanishing Point command. 
This copied element can be from the same image or a different image. It 
can also be a text layer.
 
2. Choose Filter➪Vanishing Point.
 
 The Vanishing Point dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 3-16.
Create Plane tool
PhotoSpin
Figure 3-16: Boxes are good candidates for working with the 
Vanishing Point command.

634
Working with Vanishing Point
 
3. Grab the Create Plane tool (second tool from the top), then click 
at each of the four corners of your plane to establish your editing 
surface.
 
 Be as accurate as you can when specifying the plane on your image.
 
 A bounding box with nodes at each corner and a grid appears over the 
plane surface, as shown in Figure 3-17. Feel free to tweak the plane to 
perfection — just move or resize the plane by using the Create Plane 
or Edit Plane tools. Photoshop informs you if your plane has a problem 
by displaying a bounding box and grid as red or yellow. If you have a 
problem grid, adjust the bounding box until it becomes blue (indicating 
the plane is valid) by moving a corner node. Note that you may have to 
move multiple nodes.
Figure 3-17: Define your editing plane with the Create Plane tool.
 
4. Use the Grid Size slider, accessed by clicking on the double-headed 
arrow, to adjust the size of the grid units to better line up the plane 
and grid with the elements that may be in your image, such as tiles, 
texture, windows, or doors.
 
5. (Optional) If desired, you can use the Create Plane tool and Ctrl-drag 
(Ô-drag on the Mac) an edge node of the plane to “tear off” an addi-
tional plane.
 
 For example, you can extend the plane around to another side, as I did 
in Figure 3-17, and create another plane. This process keeps the planes 
related to each other and ensures that your edit’s in the correct scale 

635

Working with Vanishing Point
and angle. Make sure you get your first plane exact because after you 
create an additional plane, you can no longer edit the first plane, except 
to expand it by dragging the edge nodes.
 
 Keep in mind that your second planes have to be perpendicular! You can 
tear off another plane and position it out at an angle. After creating your 
additional plane, grab either the Create Plane or Edit Plane tool, hold 
down Alt (Option on the Mac), grab the center node on the side oppo-
site from your axis, and swing it out at your desired angle. Note that you 
can also enter a value, or slide the slider, in the Angle option at the top 
of the Vanishing Point dialog box.
 
 
Note that, at this point, you can simply create perspective planes and 
then click OK and bail out. The planes you established appear in the 
future when you call up the Vanishing Point command again.
 
6. After you establish your perspective planes, select an editing task:
 
• Make a selection. Select the Marquee tool and drag a selection in the 
plane, as I did in Figure 3-18. Specify your selection options, either 
before or after the selection. You can feather the selection to get soft 
edges. Or you can adjust the opacity of the selection. You can also 
choose a Heal option. Move Mode allows you to specify the selection 
as Destination or Source. Select Destination to select the area you 
move the marquee to. Source fills an area with the contents of the 
marquee when you move the marquee and release. If you want to 
select your entire plane, just double-click with the Marquee tool.
Figure 3-18: Make a selection with the Marquee tool on your plane.

636
Working with Vanishing Point
 
• Clone. Select the Marquee or Transform tool and Alt-drag (Option-
drag on the Mac) the selection to create a copy of the selection. 
Transform (scale, rotate, or move) the selection to your liking. Clone 
as many times as you want. When you move the selection, it adjusts 
to fit the perspective of the plane, as shown in Figure 3-19.
Figure 3-19: Your cloned selection conforms to fit the perspective 
of the destination plane.
 
 Note that you have access to multiple undos within the Vanishing 
Point dialog box. But they’re limited to your single editing session. 
Press Ctrl+Z (Ô+Z on the Mac) to undo.
 
• Move a selection. Grab the Marquee or Transform tool and drag the 
selection. Hold down the Shift key to constrain the move.
 
• Transform a selection. To scale the selection, select the Transform 
tool, move the cursor on top of a node, and drag. To rotate, move 
the cursor next to a node until you see a curved double arrow. Then, 
drag in the direction of your desired rotation. Check the Flip or Flop 
option to flip the selection horizontally or vertically.
 
• Fill a selection with a piece of the image. With the Marquee tool, 
Ctrl-drag (Ô-drag on the Mac) and make the selection you want as 
the source image. You can also choose Source from the Move Mode 
pop-up menu and drag the selection to the source image. You can 
then move or clone the selection. If the selection needs to be scaled 
or rotated, grab the Transform tool.
 
• Clone by stamping with part of the image. This technique works 
exactly like the regular Photoshop Clone Stamp tool. With the Stamp 
tool, Alt-click (Option-click on the Mac) the area you want to define 

637

as the source for your cloning. Then, drag your mouse on the por-
tion of the image where you want the clone to appear. If you drag in a 
perspective plane, the Stamp tool paints the cloned area in perspec-
tive. You can specify options for your brush diameter, hardness, 
and opacity. Select a Heal option. The Off option allows you to clone 
without blending color, lighting, and shading of the surrounding 
pixels. The Luminance option allows you to clone by using the light-
ing and shading of the surrounding pixels, but keeping the color of 
the source (or sampled area). And finally, the On option enables you 
to clone by blending color, and lighting and shading, of the surround-
ing pixels. Select Aligned to sample pixels while maintaining the cur-
rent sampling point, even when you release the mouse. Deselect this 
option to sample pixels from the sampling point of each mouse click.
 
• Paint with color. Select the Brush tool and specify your options, 
which are similar to the clone options. Click the Brush Color swatch. 
Select your desired color from the Color Picker and paint by drag-
ging in your image. Like in stamping, the brush size and shape 
adjusts to stay true to the perspective.
 
• Paste a copied element from the 
Clipboard before selecting the 
Vanishing Point command. Press Ctrl+V 
(Ô+V on the Mac) to paste your ele-
ment. With your Marquee tool, position 
the element on your plane, where it 
adjusts to fit the perspective.
 
• Move around, measure, and mag-
nify, as needed. The Hand, Zoom, and 
Measure tools make measuring and 
navigation easy. You can also access the 
magnification pop-up menu and the plus 
(+) and minus (–) buttons at the bottom 
of the window.
 
7. Click OK.
No one will be the wiser that your composite 
image, shown in Figure 3-20, doesn’t really exist 
in the world as we know it. Save your edited 
image as a native Photoshop (.psd), TIFF, or 
JPEG file to ensure that your perspective planes 
are saved.

If you’re not familiar with the concept of resolution, I sug-
gest taking a look at Book II, Chapter 1. That’s where I cover 
all the basics on resolution, pixel dimension, resampling, and 
other related topics. For full descriptions on color modes and file formats, 
see Book II, Chapter 2. That said, the following sections give you the low-
down on the proper settings for an image that will ultimately go to print.

Resolution and modes
Table 1-1 provides some guidelines about what resolution settings to use 
for the most common types of output. Remember, these are just guidelines. 
They aren’t chiseled in stone to withstand the sands of time or anything lofty 
like that. You need to communicate with your service bureau, offset printer, 
or client and get specifications and/or recommendations. (See the section 
“Working with a Service Bureau,” later in this chapter.)

Screen frequencies
For the recommended resolution for color separations in Table 1-1, I list 2 
multiplied by the number of lines per inch. The lines per inch, or lpi, per-
tains to the screen frequency of the output device. Screen frequencies are 
measured in lines per inch in a halftone screen. You may also hear the terms 
screen ruling or line screen. When images are printed, they’re converted into 
a series of dots called halftones. When you print your halftone, you print it 
by using a halftone screen of a certain value. The average screen frequency 
for printing four-color images is 133 to 175 lpi. Therefore, when you multiply 
that number by 2, you need to create your images by using a resolution set-
ting of 266 to 350 dots per inch (dpi).
File formats
 
As far as file formats go, what you choose depends on a couple of issues:
 
✓ What you intend to do with the image — print it to a laser printer, order 
prints from an online photo printer?
 
✓ What does your service bureau, offset printer, client, director, or 
another interested party prefer?
Table 1-2 lists some of the more popular recommended formats for specific 
jobs, but again, communicate with the parties involved to see what’s ulti-
mately the best format to use.

Working with a Service Bureau
Working with a Service Bureau
Service bureaus handle photo processing and various photographic output 
options, such as prints (of varying sizes) and slides. Mounting and lamina-
tion services may also be provided. Many service bureaus provide scanning 
services, including high-end drum scanning. A common service is taking 
scans or digital photos and burning them onto CDs or DVDs. Many service 
bureaus provide output to color separations to film and RC paper. Larger 
bureaus may even have a digital press to handle a short-run (500 or less), 
on-demand printing need.
Getting the ball rolling
 
Developing a good working relationship with your service bureau and/or 
offset printer can save you a lot of time, money, and frustration. These folks 
are the experts and know their equipment and processes. And believe me, 
they’re only too willing to help. The fewer problems they have with your 
files, the better they like it. You can do some things to keep the relationship 
on solid footing:
 
✓ Get a dialogue going about the specs: If your file is going directly to a 
newspaper, magazine, or other publication, talk with the art director, 
graphics production coordinator, or other knowledgeable person about 
the graphic specifications required. 
 
✓ Build a lasting relationship: Consistency is also key. When you find a 
good bureau or offset printer, stick with it for all your jobs. Jumping from 
one company to another because a quote came in a little cheaper doesn’t 
always pay off in the long run. If you’re a faithful customer, often your ser-
vice bureau or offset printer will match that lower quote if it can. 
 
✓ Get on the Web: Many service bureaus have Web sites where you can 
find a listing of services they offer, price lists, file specs, and even down-
loadable order forms. Larger offset printers also have general informa-
tion, online requests for quote applications, and more. 
Using a prepress checklist
 
To prepare your file for print, use the following list to ensure your file is 
ready and rarin’ for problem-free output. Note that this list isn’t all-inclusive 
when it comes to prepress; I include tips that pertain to Photoshop only. 

645
Book IX
Chapter 1
Prepping Graphics 
for Print
Working with a Service Bureau
 
✓ Always transform your images in their native application. Size, crop, 
rotate, shear, and reflect art in Photoshop. Transforming images in an 
illustration or page layout program is complex and time-consuming.
 
✓ Ensure that images can first print from Photoshop. Do this before 
importing the images into an illustration or page layout program.
 
✓ If you’re placing Photoshop EPS images into a page layout or illustra-
tion program, set the halftone screen frequency in the destination 
program instead of embedding it in each image in Photoshop. Or better 
yet, don’t set any halftone screen frequencies in your images and let your 
service bureau or offset printer handle setting them in the other program.
 
✓ When saving Photoshop images for print purposes, stick to TIFF, EPS, 
native PSD, or PDF file formats. If you’re unsure of the proper format 
to use for a specific job, ask your offset printer or service bureau.
 
✓ Make sure that you use the proper color mode. For example, use CMYK 
for color separations and RGB for slide output. 
 
✓ Create vector shapes and paths efficiently. Use the fewest number of 
anchor points possible to create the path and delete any unnecessary or 
stray points. Leave your flatness setting blank. Photoshop uses the default 
setting for the output device, which is usually a safe bet.
 
✓ Limit the number of typefaces. Downloading takes time. Limiting the 
number of typefaces also makes your document look more sophisticated 
and polished. 
 
✓ Make sure that all scanning is at the appropriate dpi. For more on reso-
lution, see Book II, Chapter 1.
 
✓ If your image is to bleed (extend to the edge of the printed page), take 
that into account when creating your image. Note that you need to 
allow for 1/8 to 1/4 of an inch on any side that will bleed to allow for slip-
pages when the paper is cut.
 
✓ Always specify colors from a Pantone color swatch chart and then 
select the color, whether process or spot, in Photoshop. Never trust the 
way colors look on-screen because of calibration deficiencies and differ-
ences between RGB and CMYK color models.
 
✓ Make spot color names consistent. Make sure that the Photoshop spot 
color names exactly match those of any programs to which you are 
importing your image, such as an illustration or page layout program. 
Otherwise, you may get an additional color separation.
 
✓ Print and provide laser or inkjet prints of your file, both separations 
(if warranted), and a composite print. Print all prints with printer 
marks — crop marks, registration marks, labels, and so on.

646
Saving and Printing Vector Data in a Raster File
 
✓ Provide all fonts used in your file. Provide both screen and PostScript 
printer fonts, if applicable.
 
✓ Choose File➪Save As for your final save to squeeze down to the small-
est file size. 
 
✓ Organize your files into folders. For example, put the image files 
together in one folder, all the fonts in another, and so on. 
 
✓ Communicate any trapping needs to your service bureau or offset 
printer. For color separations, indicate whether you created the trap-
ping yourself or if you want the service bureau/offset printer to do it.
Saving and Printing Vector Data in a Raster File
Photoshop allows you to create vector shapes and vector type with the Pen 
tools, shape tools, and type tools (I explain how in Book III). Technically, the 
vector shapes are clipping paths applied to a bitmap, or raster, layer. But the 
clipping path is still a vector path, thereby retaining vector qualities. This 
vector data is resolution independent, which means that it prints at the reso-
lution of the PostScript output device. Photoshop sends the printer separate 
images for each type and shape layer, which are printed on top of the raster 
image and clipped by using their vector paths. The edges of the vector path 
print at the full resolution of the PostScript printer, but the contents, such 
as the colored pixels or the image pixels within the vector path, print at the 
resolution of the Photoshop file (all portions of the type are resolution inde-
pendent). Therefore, type and shapes always have crisp, hard edges, with 
curves appearing smooth and never jagged.
Some file format warnings
If you save your file as an EPS or DCS and 
reopen the file in Photoshop, Photoshop raster-
izes the vector data to pixels. Save the original 
in the native PSD format.
If you save your layered file as an EPS, 
Photoshop converts your vector type to clip-
ping paths. Extensive and small type creates 
complex clipping paths, which can be time 
consuming and sometimes difficult to print. 
You can either flatten your file or deselect the 
Include Vector Data option in the Save as EPS 
Options dialog box. Either choice rasterizes the 
type into pixels at the resolution of your image. 
You may want to consider eliminating the type 
in your image file and applying it either in a 
drawing or page layout program that can retain 
vector type.

647

Prepping Graphics

Choosing Color Management Print Options
 
Remember that the only file formats that allow you to retain vector data 
are PSD, PDF, DCS, and EPS. When saving to DCS or EPS, be sure to select 
the Include Vector Data option in their respective Options dialog boxes. All 
other file formats rasterize the vector data.
Choosing Color Management Print Options
I highly recommend checking out the color management section in Book II, 
Chapter 3. In that chapter, I go into great detail about the concept of color 
spaces, ICC profiles, and so on. In this section, I cover the color management 
options you can find in the Print with Preview dialog box.
Different output devices operate in different color spaces. Monitors, desktop 
printers, large format printers, film recorders, offset printers, and so on all 
have their own unique color space. The color management options enable 
you to convert the color space of your image while printing. So, for example, 
if the ICC (color) profile of your image is sRGB, you can choose to have your 
image’s color space converted to the color space of your Epson printer 
when you print.
 
Unfortunately, I can’t tell you what specific settings to choose. This choice 
is a widely debated topic, and different printers have their strengths, short-
comings, and quirks. My advice is to take an hour and a pack of paper, run 
test prints to see which settings give you the most accurate result, and stick 
with those. You may even get different results from different types of paper.
When you have some free time, follow these steps to experiment with the 
Color Management settings and discover what print settings work best:
 
1. Choose File➪Print to open the Print dialog box, shown in Figure 1-1.
 
2. Select Color Management from the pop-up menu in the top-right of the 
Print dialog box.
 
3. Select either Document or Proof.
 
 Remember you’re experimenting. So select one, and then try the other:
 
• Document: Uses the color profile of your image.
 
• Proof: By default, uses the color profile of your Working CMYK 
color space, which you defined in your Color Settings dialog box. 
You can change this profile, however, by choosing View➪Proof 
Setup➪Current Custom Setup. For details on proofs, see Book II, 
Chapter 3.

648

4. Select a method from the Color Handling drop-down list.
 
 The options differ, depending on whether you chose Document or Proof 
in Step 3.
 
 If you chose Document in the Print area, here are your options:
 
• Printer Manages Colors: Sends the document unchanged to the 
printer, tagged with its color profile. The printer driver then picks an 
appropriate color profile and converts your document’s colors to the 
final printout. Just make sure you enable color management in your 
printer dialog box.
 
• Photoshop Manages Colors: Tells Photoshop to handle the color 
conversion, using the settings you select from the Printer Profile and 
Rendering Intent pop-up menus. Photoshop also checks whether 
you selected the Black Point Compensation option with this setting. 
If you did, make sure you disable any color management in your 
printer dialog box.
 
• Separations: Select this option if you want to print color separations 
(see the following section). Note that your image must be in CMYK 
mode.
 
• No Color Management: If you select this option, no conversion 
occurs.

649
Book IX
Chapter 1
Prepping Graphics 
for Print
Choosing Color Management Print Options
 
 If you chose Proof in the Print area, you see the same options, but a 
couple of them produce different results:
 
• Printer Manages Colors: Works only with a PostScript (PS level 2 or 
higher) printer, which manages the color conversion of the proof to 
the print based on your selection of Simulate Paper Color or Simulate 
Black Ink.
 
• Photoshop Manages Colors: Tells Photoshop to handle the color con-
version of the proof to the print, using the printer profile specified in 
the pop-up menu and your choice of simulation. Unless you have a lot 
of dark colors, I recommend leaving it on Simulate Paper Color.
 
5. If you chose Photoshop Manages Colors in Step 4, select your printer 
and paper type from the Printer Profile pop-up menu.
 
 
Note that profiles associated with the current printer you select in the 
Printer submenu are sorted and placed at the top of the profile list.
 
 
Although you may be able to change the Rendering Intent setting, I 
recommend leaving this at the default setting of Relative Colorimetric, 
especially when printing photos or multi-colored artwork. If, by chance, 
your image has a lot of areas of solid saturated color, you can try 
Saturation. Also, leave the Black Point Compensation check box at the 
default setting of checked or unchecked (depending on your Color 
Handling choice) — unless, of course, you’re a color guru and have a 
better reason not to. Setting this option enables your printer to more 
accurately print the blacks in your image.
 
 
When you select Photoshop Manages Color, you have three new options 
located directly below the image preview. These options are strictly 
preview options and affect only how you see your image on the com-
puter screen. The Match Print Colors option displays a soft proof of 
your print based on the profiles, color management options, and printer 
you select. See Book II, Chapter 3, for more on soft proofs. The Gamut 
Warning option displays colors that will be out of gamut, or out the 
range of printable colors. These colors appear as gray pixels by default. 
And, finally, the Show Paper White option simulates the white point of 
the paper you select in the Printer Profile submenu. My paper of choice 
is Premium Matte, as shown in Figure 1-1.
 
6. When you finish making your selections, click Print.
 
 The final dialog box appears. Depending on your printer, options will 
vary. In Vista, click the Preferences button and search for paper/media 
and quality options. On the Mac, click the Options pop-up menu and 
look for the same. Depending on whether your printer is an Epson, 
Canon, HP, or other, the names of these settings vary.

650
Getting Four-Color Separations
 
 
If you selected the Photoshop Manages Colors option, you should turn 
off color management in your particular printer’s dialog box.
 
 That’s all there is to it. If you want more information on printing, check 
out Book I, Chapter 3. For more explanation on color management, see 
Book II, Chapter 3.
 
If all you want to do is print color prints on your desktop printer, I recom-
mend starting off by selecting Document in the Print area and selecting 
Photoshop Manages Colors for Color Handling, which gives you the most 
control over printing. If you have a little time and paper to burn, then print 
another copy by using the Printer Manages Colors option. Do a side-by-side 
comparison to see which one looks superior. You can also crack the seal on 
the documentation that came with your printer for any recommendations.
Getting Four-Color Separations
It’s necessary to color separate your image whenever you plan to print your 
image to an offset press. Your image must first be in CMYK color mode 
(choose Image➪Mode➪CMYK Color). Then, the composite color image gets 
digitally separated into the four-color channels — cyan, magenta, yellow, 
and black — and is output. (These colors are also known as process colors.) 
Sometimes, the separation output is onto film, and sometimes, it’s output 
directly to aluminum printing plates. The plates are put on an offset press, 
paper runs through each of the four inked rollers (cyan first, then magenta, 
yellow, and finally black), and out comes your composite image.
Before you take your image to a service bureau or offset printer to get color 
separations, it’s wise to get what are called laser separations. Basically, 
you’re color separating your image, not to film or plates, but to paper.
 
If your image doesn’t separate to paper, most likely it won’t to film or plates, 
either. You can go back and correct the problem, rather than pay upward of 
$80 to $150 an hour to have the service bureau or offset printer correct it for 
you. Consider laser separations a cheap insurance policy.
Follow these steps to get laser separations from your desktop printer:
 
1. Be sure your image mode is CMYK. If it isn’t, choose Image➪Mode➪
CMYK Color.
 
 I’m assuming your image is a four-color image. But it may also be a gray-
scale, duotone, tritone, or quadtone image, in which case, no conversion 
to CMYK is necessary. (See Book II, Chapter 2, for more on modes.)
 
 After the conversion, you have an image with four channels — Cyan, 
Magenta, Yellow, and Black, like the one shown in Figure 1-2.

2. Choose File➪Print, then select Color Management from the pop-up

3. In the Print area, select Document.
 
 The setting should say U.S. Web Coated (SWOP) v2.
 
4. Select Separations from the Color Handling pop-up menu.
 
 This option prints each channel from the image to a separate plate, or in 
the case of laser separations, paper.
 
5. Select Output from the pop-up menu in the top-right of the dialog box,  
then select additional options as you desire.
 
 For general print options, see Book I, Chapter 3. For additional options, 
see Table 1-3.
 
 
Note that if you’re printing to a non-PostScript printer, some of these 
options may not be available. You see a preview of most of these options 
when you apply them to your file.

652
Getting Four-Color Separations
 
6. Click the Print button.
 
 If all goes well, four pieces of paper, one for each of the four CMYK chan-
nels, print. If you’re printing a grayscale, duotone, tritone, or quadtone 
image, you get one to four pieces of paper, one for each color used. If 
that doesn’t happen, something’s amiss, and it’s time for troubleshoot-
ing. Be sure to take these laser separations with you when you hand 
over your file to the service bureau or offset printer.

Creating Spot Color Separations
Photoshop allows you to add separate channels for spot colors (see Book VI, 
Chapter 1, for more on channels), which can then be color separated. Spot, 
or custom, colors are premixed inks manufactured by various ink companies, 
the most popular in the U.S. being Pantone. A spot color is often used for a 
logo, type, or small illustration. Spot colors are also used when you need to 
apply metallic inks or varnishes to your print job. Spot colors can be used 
rather than, or in addition to, the four process CMYK colors.
 
If you’re delving into the world of spot colors, I highly recommend that you 
choose your color from a printed Pantone swatch book, available from www.
pantone.com. Because your screen is an RGB device and you’re setting up 
your file for a CMYK output device, the colors you see on-screen don’t match 
the colors that are ultimately on paper — at best, they’re a ballpark match. 
For accuracy, you must select the colors from the printed swatch book. For 
more on working with color, see Book II, Chapter 3.

654
Creating Spot Color Separations
Creating a spot channel
Follow these steps to create a spot channel:
 
1. On a separate layer, create the graphic or type to which you want to 
apply the spot color.
 
2. Ctrl-click (Ô-click on the Mac) the thumbnail of the layer to select the 
graphic and then choose Edit➪Fill to fill it with any solid color at an 
opacity of 100 percent.
 
3. With your selection active, 
choose Window➪Channels and 
then select New Spot Channel 
from the Channels panel 
pop-up menu.
 
 You can apply a spot color to 
only an active selection. It can’t be 
applied to just a layer.
 
 The New Spot Channel dialog box 
appears, as shown in Figure 1-3.
 
4. In the Name text box, enter a name for your spot color. In the Ink 
Characteristics area, click 
the color swatch.
 
 I recommend naming your spot 
color according to the spot color 
you want to use, such as Pantone 
7417C.
 
 When you click the color swatch, 
the Color Picker appears.
 
5. Click the Color Libraries button 
in the Color Picker and select 
your Pantone color from the Color 
Libraries dialog box that appears 
(see Figure1-4), then click OK.
 
6. In the New Spot Channel dialog box, select a Solidity value between 0 
percent and 100 
percent.
 
 A value of 100 percent represents an ink that’s completely opaque, such 
as a metallic ink, which completely covers the inks beneath it. A value 
of 0 percent represents a transparent ink, such as a clear varnish. But 
the solidity value affects only the screen view and composite prints; it 
doesn’t affect the separations. It can help you see where a “clear” var-
nish will print.
Figure 1-3: Adding an additional color 
separation in Photoshop requires creating a 
spot color channel first.
Figure 1-4: Select an appropriate color 
from the Color Libraries dialog box.

7. Click OK to close the dialog box.
 
 Your spot channel appears in the Channels 
panel and is filled in the image, as well. I cre-
ated a spot channel for my crest graphic and 
for the type (Pantone 7417C), as shown in 
Figure 1-5.
 
 In the printing process, spot colors are over-
printed on top of the four-color image, as 
shown in Figure 1-6. That means that the spot 
color is applied at the end of the printing 
process and is printed over the other inks. 
This can sometimes cause lighter spot colors 
to darken somewhat.
 
 If you need your spot color graphic to knock 
out the underlying image, create it in an illustration or page layout pro-
gram. A knockout is a hole left in the four-color image, which is filled 
with the spot ink. The spot ink 
doesn’t print over the other inks.
 
8. Save the image in the native 
Photoshop, Photoshop PDF, or 
Photoshop DCS 2.0 (Desktop Color 
Separations) format.
 
 If the image is being separated 
directly out of Photoshop, leave it 
as a PSD or PDF file. If you want to 
import it into a different program, 
such as InDesign, or QuarkXPress, 
you must save it as a DCS file. If 
your image is a duotone, tritone, or 
quadtone image, you also have to 
go through a few more hoops. You 
must first convert it to multichannel 
mode by choosing Image➪Mode.
 
 In the DCS 2.0 Format dialog box, 
make sure that the Include Halftone 
Screen and Include Transfer options 
aren’t selected.
 
 Import the image into your destina-
tion application and set your screen 
angles.

Editing a spot channel
After you create a spot channel, you can edit it. Select the channel in the 
Channels panel and use a painting or editing tool to paint with black, white, 
or any shade of gray, just as you would with an alpha channel. To change 
any of the options of the spot channel, double-click the spot channel thumb-
nail, or select it and then select Channel Options from the panel pop-up 
menu. Select a different color or solidity.
Converting an alpha channel to a spot channel
If you want to convert an alpha channel to a 
spot channel, select the alpha channel in the 
Channels panel and select Channel Options from 
the panel’s pop-up menu. Rename the channel 
and select Spot Color. Click the color swatch 
and select a color from the Color Libraries sec-
tion of the Color Picker. Click OK, then click OK 
again. Note that Photoshop converts all areas 
containing nonwhite pixels (unselected to par-
tially selected areas) to the spot color. With the 
channel still selected in the Channels panel, 
choose Image➪Adjustments➪Invert to apply 
the spot color to the white pixels or selected 
areas of the alpha channel. For details on alpha 
channels, see Book VI, Chapters 1 and 3.

S
ometimes, working with just a single shot isn’t quite enough. You 
couldn’t quite squeeze that beautiful mountain vista into one photo; it 
took three shots. Not to worry, that’s what Photoshop’s Photomerge com-
mand is for. This great command seamlessly stitches multiple shots of your 
panorama into a single image. Similarly, trying to capture the entire tonal 
range of an image can be tough. The Merge to HDR command enables you 
to take multiple exposures of an image and later merge those exposures 
into a single High Dynamic Range image, allowing 
for superior image quality. And as if that alone 
wasn’t enough, these two commands are found 
in Photoshop’s Automate menu, meaning they’re 
quite easy to use.
If you’re thinking you can find the Contact Sheet II, 
Picture Package, PDF Presentation commands also 
in the Automate menu, think again. The gurus at 
Adobe have moved these commands totally out of 
Photoshop and into a new home in Adobe Bridge. 
For more info on these commands, check out 
Book I, Chapter 4.
Using the Photomerge Command
The Photomerge command allows you to com-
bine multiple images into one continuous panoramic image. For example, 
you can take several overlapping photos of a mountain range and put them 
together into one panoramic shot using the Photomerge dialog box, as 
shown in Figure 2-1.

658
Using the Photomerge Command
Figure 2-1: The Photomerge command enables you to combine multiple images into one 
continuous panoramic shot.
 
If you know you ultimately want to create a Photomerge composition, you 
can make things easier by making sure that when you shoot your photos, 
you overlap your individual images by 15 to 40 percent, but no more than 
70 percent. Adobe also recommends that you avoid using distortion lenses 
(such as fish-eye) and your camera’s zoom setting. Finally, try to stay in the 
same position and keep your camera at the same level for each shot. Using 
a tripod and rotating the head can help you achieve this consistency.
Follow these steps to assemble your own Photomerge composition:
 
1. Choose File➪Automate➪Photomerge.
 
 You can also select your desired source images and choose Tools➪
Photoshop➪Photomerge in Adobe Bridge. Using Bridge is a timesaver 
because you can quickly and visually select your images.

Chapter 2
Using Photomerge 
and Merge to HDR
Using the Photomerge Command
 
2. In the Photomerge dialog box, shown in Figure 2-1, select your source 
files.
 
 You can select from Files (which uses individual files you select) or from 
Folder (which uses all images in a folder) from the Use pop-up menu. 
Click the Add Open Files to use all currently open files. Or click the 
Browse button to navigate to your desired files or folder.
 
 If you want to delete a file from the list, select it and click Remove.
 
3. Select Blend Images Together to correct the color differences that can 
occur from blending images with different exposures.
 
 Photoshop then blends the colors and tones.
 
 If the Blend Images Together option doesn’t help, you can always create 
a blending group. First, in your Layers panel, create a new group con-
taining the layer you want to change. Next, change the group Blend 
mode to Normal. Finally, add an adjustment layer, such as Levels or 
Exposure, in the group above the layer you want to change. For more 
on adjustment layers, see Book V, Chapter 1. For more on blend modes, 
see Book V, Chapter 3.
 
4. Select Vignette Removal to correct exposure problems caused by lens 
vignetting (when light at the edges of images is reduced and therefore 
edges are darkened).
 
5. Select Geometric Distortion Correction to correct for lens distortions, 
such as radial distortion, barrel distortion (bulging out), and pincush-
ion distortion (pinching in).
 
 You can use this option to align shots taken with a fish-eye lens.
 
6. In the Layout area, select your desired project mode, as shown in 
Figure 2-1.
 
 The thumbnail illustration visually demonstrates each mode, but I’ll give 
you a little more description of each:
 
• Auto: Select the Auto mode to make Photoshop analyze your images 
on its own.
 
• Perspective: Select this mode if your images have been shot with 
perspective, or at acute angles. This mode is also recommended for 
High Dynamic Range (HDR) images.
 
• Cylindrical: Select this option if you shot your images with a wide- 
angle lens. This mode is also good for those 360-degree, full pan-
oramic shots.
 
• Spherical: This mode is handy when stitching together a 360-degree 
panorama, in which you have a wide field of view, both horizontally 
and vertically. Use this option for shots taken with a wide-angle lens.

660
Using the Photomerge Command
 
• Collage: This new projection method aligns images by rotating, posi-
tioning, and uniformly scaling each image. It may be the best choice 
for pure panoramas, but you can also find it useful for stitching 
together images based on common features.
 
• Reposition: When you select this mode, Photoshop doesn’t take into 
account any distortion, but merely scans the images and positions 
them in what it considers the best position.
 
 Note that Photoshop has removed the Interactive Layout mode, in which 
you could manually assemble your composition, in Version CS4. If you 
miss this mode, you can find it as an optional downloadable plug-in at 
www.adobe.com.
 
7. Click OK.
 
 Photoshop marches off and attempts to automatically align and “stitch” 
your source images into a new Photoshop image, shown in Figure 2-2. 
Hopefully, all goes well; however, if Photoshop can’t align and merge, it 
presents an alert that says “some images could not be aligned.”
PhotoDisc
Figure 2-2: The Photomerge command enables you to combine multiple images into one 
continuous panoramic shot.
 
 No matter which projection mode you select, Photoshop leaves your 
merged image in layers. In addition to those layers, Photoshop may 
also add a layer mask to each layer to better blend and composite your 
merged image. These layer masks act like any other layer masks, meaning 
you can edit them to your liking. For more on layer masks, see Book VI, 
Chapter 3.

Using Photomerge 
and Merge to HDR
Using the Merge to HDR Command
Using the Merge to HDR Command
Have you ever caught an early matinee and emerged mole-like from the pitch 
black theater into the bright light of high noon, only to have to squint for a 
while because your eyes burned? Or on the flip side, have you blindly tumbled 
into your seat, popcorn scattering all over the aisle in that same darkened 
theater because you just came in from the bright daylight? In both cases, your 
eyes needed some time to adjust to the abrupt change from extreme dark 
to extreme light or vice versa. Cameras suffer from the same problem. But 
although our eyes can eventually adapt to varying brightness levels, cameras 
and devices, such as computer monitors and scanners, can capture only a 
fixed dynamic, or tonal, range. In digital imaging tech talk, dynamic range is the 
ratio of the darkest and brightest values a device can capture simultaneously.
In the past, digital photography aficionados were hindered when perform-
ing higher-end image editing tasks in Photoshop because they were forced 
to work within a limited dynamic range. Recent versions of Photoshop have 
provided users with plenty of support for High Dynamic Range (HDR) images. 
HDR images, which contain 32 bits of data per channel, are superior to non-
HDR images because they can capture a much larger dynamic range — in fact, 
they’re able to represent the entire dynamic range of the real world.
Photographers can take multiple exposures of an image and then later merge 
those multiple exposures into a single photo in Photoshop, thereby captur-
ing the entire dynamic range into a single HDR image. Although you can use 
the Merge to HDR command on 8- or 16-bit images, be aware that only 32-bit 
images can store all the HDR data.
 
Adobe offers a few tips to maximize your success with the Merge to HDR 
command:
 
✓ Use a tripod when shooting multiple exposures of the same scene to 
ensure you’re capturing the exact same shot each time.
 
✓ Make sure you take enough shots to cover the entire dynamic range of 
your subject. Shoot for a minimum of three, but try for five to seven, if 
not more.
 
✓ Vary the shutter speed to create different exposures, instead of varying 
your aperture or ISO, which can cause noise, vignetting, and altering of 
depth of field.
 
✓ Make sure the exposure difference between the shots is one or two 
Exposure Value (EV) steps apart. Use one or two f-stops apart as a guide.
 
✓ Don’t vary the lighting in the shots.
 
✓ Don’t shoot anything that’s moving. The scene needs to be static.

662
Using the Merge to HDR Command
Follow these steps to use this feature:
 
1. Choose File➪Automate➪Merge to HDR.
 
 The Merge to HDR dialog box 
appears, as shown in Figure 2-3.
 
 Note that you can also access this 
command in Bridge by choosing 
Tools➪Photoshop➪Merge to HDR.
 
 Note that you can even create 
32-bit images via the File New 
dialog box. Simply select 32-bit 
from the Bit Depth pop-up menu 
to the right of the Color Mode 
pop-up menu.
 
2. Select either Files or Folder from 
the Use pop-up menu.
 
 You can also select Add Open Files if you want to use files that are cur-
rently open in Photoshop. Just make sure that they’ve been saved first.
 
3. If you selected Files or Folder in Step 2, click the Browse button, select 
the images, and click Open.
 
 If you choose an image by accident, simply select it and click Remove.
 
4. Check Attempt to Automatically Align Source Images if you want 
Photoshop to try to line up your various exposures.
 
 Note that this is a good idea if you shot your photos without the use of 
a tripod. Also note that your images need to be the same dimension and 
resolution for this command to work.
 
5. Click OK.
 
 You may get a mini dialog box that asks you to manually set your 
Exposure Value. You need to specify your exposure time (shutter 
speed), f-stop (aperture), and ISO (film speed) for all your images.
 
 A second dialog box appears with thumbnails of your chosen images on 
the left and a large preview of the merged image in the center.
 
6. Based on how you like the merged image, you can select or deselect 
any of the thumbnails in the source area by checking or unchecking 
the check boxes.
 
 Photoshop may bark that you don’t have enough dynamic range to get a 
“useful” HDR image, in which case, you have to bail out.
 
 If you want to zoom in and out of your images, click the – and + buttons, 
or use the View pop-up menu at the bottom of the Preview window.
Figure 2-3: Select two or more files to 
merge in the Merge to HDR dialog box.

Using the Merge to HDR Command
 
7. In the Bit Depth menu, shown in Figure 2-4, select your desired bit 
depth for the merged image.
 
 Be sure to leave your 32-bit image set to 32 Bit if you want to capture 
and store the entire dynamic range.
 
8. Use the White Point slider to set the white point for the merged image 
if you want to see a better preview.
 
 The dynamic range of HDR images surpasses what your monitor can 
show. So, when you view these images on your computer, they can look 
pretty nasty — too dark and undersaturated. If you adjust the preview 
with the White Point slider, Photoshop provides a better display of 
the image without altering the image data at all. Remember that if your 
image is 32-bit, adjusting the white point affects only the preview, not 
the actual image data. That preview adjustment should then be saved in 
the HDR file and applied whenever the file is opened in Photoshop. But, 
if your image is 16- or 8-bit, adjusting the white point applies the adjust-
ment to the actual image data itself.
Figure 2-4: Specify your desired bit depth and adjust your white point.

664
Using the Merge to HDR Command
 
9. Select either an Automatic or saved (which you need to load) 
Response Curve.
 
10. Click OK.
 
 Your merged HDR image appears in all its full dynamic glory in the 
Merge to HDR dialog box.
 
 Even if you want to ultimately convert your 32-bit image to 16-bit or 
even 8-bit, always make your exposure and contrast corrections first 
and then convert it. You’ll get your dynamic range the way you want it. 
After you click OK in the Merge to HDR dialog box, the HDR Conversion 
dialog box appears. Select your desired method from the pop-up menu. 
Exposure and Gamma adjust the brightness and contrast of the image. 
Highlight and Compression compress the highlight values so they fall 
within the tonal range of an 8- or 16-bit image. Equalize Histogram, an 
automatic method, compresses the dynamic range but tries to retain 
contrast. If you select Local Adaptation, click the triangle to expand 
the Toning Curve and Histogram, where you can make adjustments 
to the curve. The Histogram shows the Luminance (amount of light) 
value. Each red tick mark represents 1 Exposure Value (or f-stop). 
Adjust the Radius slider to specify the size of the area affected. Adjust 
the Threshold slider to specify how different the tones of two adjacent 
pixels must be before contrast is detected. For more on the dynam-
ics of curves, see Book VIII, Chapter 1. Note that you can also choose 
Image➪Mode➪16-Bits or 8-Bits/Channel and make your exposure and 
contrast adjustments in the same HDR Conversion dialog box that you 
can open through the Merge to HDR dialog box.
 
 Keep in mind that you also have the option of creating layers within a 
32-bit image. This, of course, opens up a whole world of creative possi-
bilities, giving you the ability to composite multiple images. You can also 
apply another half dozen or so blend modes on those layers, including 
Hue, Saturation, and Color. As an added bonus, you can even paint on 
those 32-bit layers, as well as add type. You can have your way with the 
following tools: Brush, Pencil, Shape, Clone and Pattern Stamp, History 
Brush, Eraser, Gradient, Blur, Sharpen, Smudge, and Type. Finally, don’t 
be surprised to encounter a different dialog box when you select a color 
for an HDR image. HDR images have their very own Color Picker.
 
 Note that if you copy a layer, selection, or entire image from an 8-bit or 
16-bit file, you encounter a profile mismatch because of the differences 
in the color profiles’ gamma values. Convert your profile to match your 
HDR image. For more on color profiles, see Book II, Chapter 3.
