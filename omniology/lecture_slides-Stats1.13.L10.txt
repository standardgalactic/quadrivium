Confidence intervals for  
sample means (M) 
3 
Confidence intervals 
•  All sample statistics, for example, a 
sample mean (M), are point estimates 
•  More specifically, a sample mean (M) 
represents a single point in a sampling 
distribution

Confidence intervals 
•  The logic of confidence intervals is to 
report a range of values, rather than a 
single value 
•  In other words, report an interval estimate 
rather than a point estimate 
6 
Confidence intervals 
•  Confidence interval: an interval estimate of 
a population parameter, based on a 
random sample 
– Degree of confidence, for example 95%, 
represents the probability that the interval 
captures the true population parameter 
7 
Confidence intervals 
•  The main argument for interval estimates 
is the reality of sampling error 
•  Sampling error implies that point estimates 
will vary from one study to the next 
•  A researcher will therefore be more 
confident about accuracy with an interval 
estimate

Confidence intervals for M 
•  Example, IMPACT 
•  Assume N = 30 and multiple samples… 
– Symptom Score (Baseline), M = 0.05 
– Symptom Score (Baseline), M = 0.07 
– Symptom Score (Baseline), M = 0.03 
– …

Confidence intervals for M 
•  Example, IMPACT 
•  Assume N = 10 and multiple samples… 
– Symptom Score (Baseline), M = 0.01 
– Symptom Score (Baseline), M = 0.20 
– Symptom Score (Baseline), M = 0.00 
– …

Confidence intervals for M 
•  Example, IMPACT 
•  Assume N = 30 and multiple samples… 
– Symptom Score (Post-injury), M = 12.03 
– Symptom Score (Post-injury), M = 12.90 
– Symptom Score (Post-injury), M = 14.13 
– …

Confidence intervals for M 
•  The width of a confidence interval is 
influenced by 
– Sample size 
– Variance in the population (and sample) 
– Standard error (SE) = SD / SQRT(N) 
13 
Confidence intervals for M 
•  Example, IMPACT 
•  Assume N = 30 
– Symptom Score (Baseline) 
– 95% confidence interval 
•  -0.03 – 0.10 
14 
Confidence intervals for M 
•  Example, IMPACT 
•  Assume N = 10 
– Symptom Score (Baseline) 
– 95% confidence interval 
•  -0.10 – 0.50 
15 
Confidence intervals for M 
•  Example, IMPACT 
•  Assume N = 30 
– Symptom Score (Post-injury) 
– 95% confidence interval 
•  7.5 – 18.3

Confidence intervals for M 
•  Example, IMPACT 
•  Assume N = 10 
– Symptom Score (Post-injury) 
– 95% confidence interval 
•  2.7 – 23.9 
17 
Confidence interval for M 
•  Upper bound = M + t(SE) 
•  Lower bound = M – t(SE) 
•  SE = SD / SQRT(N) 
•  t depends on level of confidence desired 
and sample size
