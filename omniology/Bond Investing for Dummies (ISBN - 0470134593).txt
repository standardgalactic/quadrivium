About the Author
Russell Wild is a NAPFA-certified financial advisor and the principal of Global
Portfolios, an investment advisory firm based in eastern Pennsylvania. He is
one of few wealth managers in the nation who is both fee-only (takes no com-
missions) and welcomes clients of both substantial and modest means. Wild,
in addition to the fun he has with his financial calculator, is also an accom-
plished writer who helps readers understand and make wise choices about
their money. His articles have appeared in many national publications,
including AARP The Magazine, Consumer Reports, Details, Maxim, Men’s
Journal, Men’s Health, Cosmopolitan, Reader’s Digest, and Real Simple. He also
contributes regularly to professional financial journals, such as Wealth
Manager and Financial Planning.
The author or coauthor of two dozen nonfiction books, Wild’s last work, prior
to the one you’re holding in your hand, was Exchange-Traded Funds For
Dummies (Wiley, 2007). Before that was The Unofficial Guide to Getting a
Divorce (Wiley, 2005), coauthored with attorney Susan Ellis Wild, his 
ex-wife — yeah, you read that right. No stranger to the mass media, Wild has
shared his wit and wisdom on such shows as Oprah, The View, CBS Morning
News, and Good Day New York, and in hundreds of radio interviews.
Wild holds a Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree in interna-
tional management and finance from Thunderbird, the Garvin School of
International Management, in Glendale, Arizona (consistently ranked the #1
school for international business by both U.S. News and World Report and 
The Wall Street Journal); a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree in business/
economics magna cum laude from American University in Washington, D.C.;
and a graduate certificate in personal financial planning from Moravian
College in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania (America’s sixth-oldest college). A
member of the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors (NAPFA)
since 2002, Wild is also a long-time member and currently serves as vice pres-
ident of the American Society of Journalists and Authors (ASJA).
The author grew up on Long Island and now lives in Allentown, Pennsylvania
with his two children, Adrienne and Clayton, along with Norman, the killer
poodle. His Web site is www.globalportfolios.net.


Dedication
To the handful of people I’ve known in this crazy society who somehow
manage to keep proper perspective on money, and have helped me to do the
same: Arun, Auggie, Marc, Michael, Robert, Susan, and Vicki and Joe.
Author’s Acknowledgments
This being my second Dummies book, I’d like to thank for a second time all
the good people at Wiley, many of whom were involved in my first Dummies
project, Exchange-Traded Funds For Dummies. We’re becoming like old
friends! I’m so glad that you guys assigned Joan Friedman once again as the
project editor. If  Moody’s gave editors ratings, as it does bonds, Joan would
certainly be rated Aaa.
Thanks to some of my colleagues in the investment world, especially Marilyn
Cohen, official tech consultant on this book, who knows bonds better than
anyone on the planet and provided me with invaluable insight into the
behind-the-curtains world of bond trading.  And my great appreciation to
Michael Pace, an extremely sharp certified financial planner, fellow member
of the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors (NAPFA), and
excellent catcher of errors and inserter of added good information.
Thanks to Brenda Lange and David Kohn, fellow writers and members of the
American Society of Journalists and Authors (ASJA), for their literary input. 
I also appreciate the help of all the number-crunchers and media liaisons at
Morningstar, as well as some very helpful folks at the U.S. Treasury, the
Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, and the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority. Special thanks go to Rebecca Cohen at
Vanguard.
And thanks to my literary agent, Marilyn Allen, for her continued good repre-
sentation in the tangled and complicated world of book publishing.
Some others who provided very helpful input are mentioned throughout the
pages of the book. I appreciate your help, one and all. Oh, I almost forgot . . .
Thank you, Little Pepper (my daughter), for your illustrations!

Introduction
C
hances are that right now you’re standing in the Personal Finance sec-
tion of your favorite bookstore. Take a look to your left. You see that
pudgy, balding guy in the baggy jeans perusing the book on getting rich by
day-trading stock options? Look to your right. You see that gal with the
purple lipstick and the hoop earrings thumbing through that paperback on
how to make millions in foreclosed property deals? I want you to walk over to
them. Good. Now I want you to take this book firmly in your hand. Excellent.
And now I want you to smack each of them over the head with it.
Nice job!
Wiley (the publisher of this book) has lawyers who are going to want me to
assure you that I’m only kidding about smacking anyone. So in deference to
the attorneys, and because I want to get my royalty checks . . . I’m kidding!
I’m only kidding! Don’t hit anyone!
But the fact is that someone should knock some sense into these people. If
not, they may wind up — as the vast majority of people who try to get rich
quick do — with nothing but big holes in their pockets.
Those who make the most money in the world of investments possess an
extremely rare commodity in today’s world — something called patience. At
the same time they’re looking for handsome returns, they are also looking to
protect what they have. Why? Because a loss of 75 percent in an investment
(think tech stocks 2000–2002) requires you to earn 400 percent to get back to
where you started. Good luck getting there!
In fact, garnering handsome returns and protecting against loss are pretty
much the same thing, as any financial professional should tell you. But only
the first half of the equation — the handsome return part — gets the lion’s
share of the ink. Heck, there must be 1,255 books on getting rich quick for
every one book on limiting risk and growing wealth slowly but surely.
Welcome to that one book: Bond Investing For Dummies.

So just what are bonds? The word bond basically means an IOU. You lend
your money to Uncle Sam, to General Electric, to Procter & Gamble, to the
city in which you live — to whatever entity issues the bonds — and that
entity promises to pay you a certain rate of interest in exchange for borrow-
ing your money. This is very different from stock investing, where you pur-
chase shares in a company, become an alleged partial owner of that
company, and then start to pray that the company churns a profit and the
CEO doesn’t pocket it all.
Stocks (which really aren’t as bad as I just made them sound) and bonds
complement each other like peanut butter and jelly. Bonds are the peanut
butter that can keep your jelly from dripping to the floor. They are the life
rafts that can keep your portfolio afloat when the investment seas get
choppy. Yes, bonds are also very handy as a source of steady income, but,
contrary to popular myth, that should not be their major role in most 
portfolios.
Bonds are the sweethearts that may have saved your grandparents from sell-
ing apples on the street during the hungry 1930s. (Note that I’m not talking
about high-yield “junk” bonds here.) They are the babies that may have
saved your 401(k) from devastation during the three growly bear-market
years on Wall Street that started this century. Bonds belong in nearly every
portfolio. Whether they belong in your portfolio is something I help you to
decide in this book.
About This Book
Allow the next 340 or so pages to serve as your guide to understanding
bonds, choosing the right bonds or bond funds, getting the best buys on your
purchases, and achieving the best prices when you sell them. You also find
out how to work bonds into a powerful, well-diversified portfolio that serves
your financial goals much better (I promise) than day-trading stock options
or attempting to make a profit flipping real estate in your spare time.
I present to you, in easy-to-understand English (unless you happen to be
reading the Ukrainian or Korean translation), the sometimes complex, even
somewhat mystical and magical world of bonds. I explain such concepts as
bond maturity, duration, coupon rate, callability, and yield, and I show you
the differences between the many different kinds of bonds, such as
Treasuries, agency bonds, corporates, munis, zeroes, convertibles, strips,
and TIPS.

Bond Investing For Dummies 

You discover the mistakes that many bond investors make, the traps that
some wily bond brokers lay for the uninitiated, and the heartbreak that can
befall those who buy certain bonds without first doing their homework.
(Don’t worry — I walk you through how to do your homework.) You find out
how to mix and match your bonds with other kinds of assets, such as stocks
and real estate, taking advantage of the latest in investment research to help
you maximize your return with minimal risk.
Here are some of the things that you need to know before buying any 
bond or bond fund — things you’ll know cold after you read Bond Investing
For Dummies:
 What’s your split gonna be? Put all your eggs in one basket, and you’re
going to wind up getting scrambled. A key to successful investing is
diversification. Yes, you’ve heard that before — so has everyone — but
you’d be amazed how many people ignore this advice!
Unless you’re working with really exotic investments, the majority of 
a portfolio is stocks and bonds. The split between those stocks and
bonds — whether you choose a 90/10 (aggressive) portfolio (composed
of 90 percent stocks and 10 percent bonds), a 70/30 (balanced) portfolio,
or a 35/65 (conservative) portfolio — is very possibly the single most
important investment decision you’ll ever make. Stocks and bonds are
very different kinds of animals, and their respective percentages in a
portfolio can have a profound impact on your financial future. Chapter
12 deals with this percentage issue directly, but the importance of
mixing and matching investments pops up in other chapters, as well.
 Exactly what kind of bonds do you want? Depending on your tax
bracket, your age, your income, your financial needs and goals, your
need for ready cash, and a bunch of other factors, you may want to
invest in Treasury, corporate, agency, or municipal bonds. Within each
of these categories, you have other choices to make: Do you want long-
term or short-term bonds? Higher quality bonds or higher yielding
bonds? Freshly issued bonds or bonds floating around on the secondary
market? Bonds issued in the United States or bonds from Mexico or
Brazil? I introduce many different bond types in Part II, and I discuss
which may be most appropriate for you — and which are likely to weigh
your portfolio down.
 Where do you bond shop? Although bonds have been around more or
less in their present form for hundreds of years (see a brief history of
bonds in Chapter 3), the way they are bought and sold has changed radi-
cally in recent years. Bond traders once had you at their tender mercy.
You had no idea what kind of money they were clipping from you every
time they traded a bond on your alleged behalf. That is no longer so.
3
Introduction

Whether you decide to buy individual bonds or bond funds (Chapter 14
helps you make that thorny decision), there are now ways to know
almost to the dime how much the hungry middlemen intend to nibble —
or have nibbled from your trades in the past. Part IV is your complete
shopper’s guide.
 What kind of returns can you expect, and what is your risk of loss?
Here is the part of bonds that most people find most confusing — and,
oh, how misconceptions abound! (You can’t lose money in U.S. govern-
ment bonds? Um . . . How can I break this news to you gently?) In
Chapter 4, I explain the tricky concepts of duration and yield. I explain
why the value of your bonds is so directly tied to prevailing interest
rates — with other economic variables giving their push and pull. I give
you the tools to determine just how much money you can reasonably
expect to make off a bond, and under what circumstances you may lose
money.
If you’ve ever read one of these black and yellow Dummies books before, you
have an idea what you’re about to embark on. This is not a book you need to
read from front to back, or (if you’re reading the Chinese or Hebrew edition)
back to front. Feel free to jump back and forth and glean whatever informa-
tion you think will help you the most. No proctor with bifocal glasses will pop
out of the air, Harry-Potter style, to test you at the end. You needn’t put it all
to memory now — or ever. Keep this reference book for years to come as
your little acorn of a bond portfolio grows into a mighty oak.
Conventions Used in This Book
To help you navigate the text of this tome as easily as possible, I use the 
following conventions:
 Whenever I introduce a new term, such as, say, callability or discount
rate, it appears (as you can clearly see) in italics. You can rest assured
that a definition or explanation is right around the corner.
 If I want to share some interesting tidbit of information that isn’t essen-
tial to your successful investing in bonds, I place it in a sidebar, a grayish
rectangle or square with its own heading, set apart from the rest of the
text. (See how this whole italics/definition thing works?)
 All Web addresses appear in monofont so they’re easy to pick out if you
need to go back and find them.

Bond Investing For Dummies 

Keep in mind that when this book was printed, some Web addresses may
have needed to break across two lines of text. Wherever that’s the case, rest
assured that we haven’t put in any extra characters (hyphens or other
doohickeys) to indicate the break. So, when using one of these Web
addresses, just type in exactly what you see in this book. Pretend as if the
line break doesn’t exist.
What You’re Not to Read
Unless you’re going to become a professional bond trader, you probably
don’t need to know everything in this book. Every few pages, you’ll undoubt-
edly come across some technical stuff that you really don’t have to know to
be a successful bond investor. Read through the technical stuff if you wish,
or, if ratios and percentages and such make you dizzy, feel free to skip over it.
Most of the heavy technical matter in this book is tucked neatly into the gray-
ish sidebars. But if any technicalities make it into the main text, I give you a
heads up with a Technical Stuff icon. That’s where you can skip or speed 
read — or choose to get dizzy. Your call!
Foolish Assumptions
If you feel you truly need to start from scratch in the world of investments,
perhaps the best place would be Investing For Dummies by Eric Tyson (pub-
lished by Wiley). But the book you’re holding in your hands is only a smidgen
above that one in terms of assumptions of investment savvy. I assume that
you are intelligent, that you have a few bucks to invest, and that you have a
basic education in math (and a maybe a very, very rudimentary knowledge of
economics) — that’s it.
In other words, even if your investing experience to date consists of opening
a savings account, balancing a checkbook, and reading a few Suze Orman
columns, you should still be able to follow along. Oh, and for those of you
who are already buying and selling bonds and feel completely comfortable in
the world of fixed income, I’m assuming that you, too, can learn something by
reading this book. (Oh? You know it all, do you? Can you tell me what a sukuk
is, or where to buy one, huh? See Chapter 9!)

Introduction

How This Book Is Organized
Here’s a thumbnail sketch of what you’ll be seeing in the next 340 or so
pages.
Part I: Bond Appetit!
In this first part, you find out what makes a bond a bond. You discover the
rationale for their being. I take you through a portal of time to see what
bonds looked like dozens, even hundreds, of years ago. You get to see how
bonds evolved and what makes them so very different from other investment
vehicles. I give you a primer on how bonds are bought and sold. And I intro-
duce you to the sometimes very helpful but sometimes misleading world of
bond ratings.
Part II: Numerous and Varied Ways 
to Make Money in Bonds
Anyone, well practically anyone, who wants to raise money can issue a bond.
The vast majority of bonds, however, are issued by the U.S. Treasury, corpo-
rations, government agencies, or municipalities. This section examines the
advantages and potential drawbacks of each and looks at the many varieties
of bonds that each of these entities may offer. I also introduce you to some
rather unusual breeds of bonds — not the kind your grandfather knew!
Part III: Customizing and Optimizing 
Your Bond Portfolio
Different investments — including bonds — bring various promises of return
and various measures of risk. Some bonds are as safe as bank CDs; others can
be as wildly volatile as tech stocks. In this part of the book, I help you assess
just how much investment risk you should be taking at this point in your life,
and how — largely using a mix of different bonds — to minimize that risk for
optimal return.

Bond Investing For Dummies 

Part IV: Bonds Away! Navigating 
the Fixed-Income Marketplace
In this part, I address the role of bond brokers, discuss the pros and cons of
owning individual bonds as opposed to bond funds, explain how to buy and
sell bonds without getting clipped, and offer ways to protect yourself so that
you don’t get stuck with any fixed-income dogs. I reveal ways for you to blow
away the black smoke that has long shrouded the world of bond trading.
Part V: Bonds As Replacements 
for the Old Paycheck
Many people think of bonds as the ultimate retirement tool. In fact, they 
are — and they aren’t. In this section, I discuss bonds as replacements for
your paycheck. As you discover, many retirees rely too heavily on bonds —
or on the wrong kinds of bonds. Reading this section, you may discover that
your nest egg needs either a minor tune-up or a major overhaul and that your
bond portfolio needs beefing up or paring down.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
In this final section — a standard feature in all Dummies books — we wrap up
the book with some practical tips and a few fun items.
Part VII: Appendix
The Web offers much in the way of additional education on bonds, as well as
some excellent venues for trading bonds. Let the appendix serve as your Web
guide.
Icons Used in This Book
Throughout the book, you find little cartoons in the margins. In the Dummies
universe, they are known as icons, and they signal certain exciting (or pos-
sibly not-so exciting) things going on in the accompanying text.
7
Introduction

Although this is a how-to book, you also find plenty of whys and wherefores.
Any paragraph accompanied by this icon, however, is guaranteed to be at
least 99.99 percent how-to.
Read twice! This icon indicates that something important is being said and is
really worth putting to memory.
The world of bond investing — although generally not as risky as the world
of stock investing — still offers pitfalls galore. Wherever you see the bomb,
know that there is a risk of your losing money.
If you don’t really care how to calculate the after-tax present value of a bond
selling at 98, yielding 4.76 percent, maturing in 9 months, and subject to AMT,
and you’re just looking to get a broad understanding of bonds, feel free to
skip or skim the more dense paragraphs with this icon.
The world of Wall Street is full of people who make money at other people’s
expense. Where you see the pig face, know that I’m about to point out an
instance where someone (most likely calling himself a bond broker or per-
haps a bond mutual-fund manager) will likely be sticking a hand deep in your
pocket.
Where to Go from Here
Where would you like to go from here? If you wish, start at the beginning. If
you’re mostly interested in municipal bonds, hey, no one says that you can’t
jump right to Chapter 8. Global bonds? Go ahead and jump to Chapter 9. It’s
entirely your call. Maybe start by skimming the index at the back of the book.

In this part . . .
I
n the first three chapters of this section, you find out
what makes a bond a bond. You discover the rationale
for their being and what makes them different from other
investment types. You can begin to assess whether bonds
belong in your portfolio (chances are they do!). I take you
on a trip back in time to see how bonds looked in yester-
year and show you how and why they evolved into the
most popular investment vehicle on earth today. You also
find out how the bond markets work, and about some rela-
tively recent developments that have turned those mar-
kets more or less on their pointed heads.
In Chapter 4, you get a preliminary education on the com-
plicated pricing of bonds and the myriad (and often con-
fusing) ways that bond returns are measured. You’ll pick
up some very important bond concepts (and much of the
bond jargon) that could help you to operate more effec-
tively as an investor in the bond market.

L
ong before I ever knew what a bond was (it’s essentially an IOU), I lent
five dollars to Tommy Potts. This was the first time that I ever lent
money to anyone. Tommy was a blond, goofy-looking kid in my seventh-grade
class. I can’t recall why he needed the five dollars so much, but he was my
pal, and he promised to repay me, so I acquiesced.
Weeks went by, and I couldn’t get my money back, no matter how much I
bellyached. Finally, I decided to go to a higher authority. So I approached
Tommy’s dad.
I figured that Mr. Potts would give Tommy a stern lecture on the importance
of maintaining his credit and good name, and that Mr. Potts would then either
make Tommy cough up my money, or he would make restitution himself.
“Er, Mr. Potts,” I said, “I lent Tommy five bucks, and . . .”
“You lent him money?” Mr. Potts interrupted, pointing his finger at his dead-
beat 12-year-old son, who, if I recall correctly, at that point had turned over
one of his pet turtles and was spinning it like a top. “Um, yes, Mr. Potts — five
dollars.” At which point, Mr. Potts neither lectured nor reached for his wallet.
Rather, he erupted into savage laugher. “You lent him money!” he bellowed
repeatedly, laughing, slapping his thighs, and pointing to his turtle-torturing
son. “You lent him money! HA . . . HA . . .HA . . . HA . . .”
And that, dear reader, was my very first experience as a creditor. I never saw
a nickel in either interest or returned principal, not to this very day.
Oh, yes, I’ve learned a lot since then.

12
Part I: Bond Appetit! 
Understanding What Makes 
a Bond a Bond
Now supposing that Tommy Potts, instead of being a goofy kid in the seventh
grade, were the United States government. Or the city of Philadelphia. Or
Procter & Gamble. Tommy, in his new powerful incarnation, needs to raise
not five dollars but $50 million, for whatever reason. So Tommy decides to
issue a bond. A bond is really not much more than an IOU with a serial
number. People in suits, to sound impressive, sometimes call bonds debt
securities or fixed-income securities.
A bond is always issued with a certain face amount, also called the principal,
also called the par value of the bond. Most often, simply because it is conven-
tion, bonds are issued with face amounts of $1,000. So in order to raise $50
million, Tommy would have to issue 50,000 bonds each selling at $1,000 par.
Of course, he would then have to go out and find investors.
Every bond pays a certain rate of interest, and typically (but not always) that
rate is fixed over the life of the bond (hence fixed-income securities). The life
of the bond, in the parlance of financial people, is known as the bond’s matu-
rity. (The bond world is full of jargon.) The rate of interest is a percentage of
the face amount and is typically (again, simply because of convention) paid
out twice a year.
So if a corporation or government issues a $1,000 bond, paying 6 percent,
that corporation or government promises to fork over to the bondholder $60
a year — or, in most cases, $30 twice a year. Then, when the bond matures,
the corporation or government gives the bondholder his or her $1,000 back.
In some cases, you can buy a bond directly from the issuer and sell it back
directly to the issuer, but in most cases, bonds are bought and sold through a
brokerage house or a bank. Oh, yes, these brokerage houses take a piece of
the pie, sometimes a quite sizeable piece — more on that (and how to limit
broker gluttony) in Part IV.
So far, so good?
In short, dealing in bonds isn’t really all that different from the deal I worked
out with Tommy Potts. It’s just a bit more formal, the issuance of bonds is
regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (and other regulatory
authorities), and most (but not all) bondholders — unlike me — wind up get-
ting paid back!

Choosing your time frame
Almost all bonds these days are issued with life spans (maturities) of up to 30
years. Few people are interested in loaning their money for longer than that,
and people young enough to think more than 30 years ahead rarely have
enough money to lend. In the parlance of bond people, any bond with a matu-
rity of less than five years is called a short bond. Bonds with maturities of 5 
to 12 years are called intermediate bonds. Bonds with maturities of 12 years
or more are called long bonds.
In general (sorry, but you’re going to read those words a lot in this book;
bond investing comes with few hard-and-fast rules), the longer the maturity,
the greater the interest rate paid. That’s because bond buyers generally
(there I go again) demand more compensation the longer they agree to tie up
their money. At the same time, bond issuers are willing to fork over more
interest in return for the privilege of holding onto your money longer.
It’s exactly the same theory and practice with bank CDs: Typically the two-
year CD pays more than the one-year CD, which pays more than the six-
month CD.
The difference between the rates you can get on short bonds versus interme-
diate bonds versus long bonds is known as the yield curve. Yield simply refers
to the annual interest rate. In Chapter 4, I provide an in-depth discussion of
interest rates, bond maturity, and the all-important yield curve.
Determining who you trust 
to hold your money
Let’s consider again the analogy to bank CDs. Both bonds and CDs tend to
pay higher rates of interest the longer the time period you’re willing to lend
your money. But that’s where the similarity ends.
When you give your money to a savings bank to plunk into a CD, that money —
your principal — is guaranteed (up to $100,000 per account) by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). For that reason, all savings bank CDs —
all those that carry FDIC insurance — are pretty much the same. You can
choose your bank because it is close to your house or because it gives lol-
lipops to your kids, but if solid economics be your guide, you should open your
CD where you’re going to get the highest rate of interest. End of story.
Things aren’t so simple in the world of bonds. A higher rate of interest isn’t
always the best deal. When you fork your money over to buy a bond, your
principal is guaranteed only by the issuer of the bond, so that guarantee is
only as solid as the issuer itself. (Remember my seventh-grade experience?)
13
Chapter 1: So You Want to Be a Bondholder

That’s why U.S. Treasury bonds (guaranteed by the United States govern-
ment) pay one interest rate, General Electric bonds pay another rate, and
General Motors bonds pay yet another rate. Can you guess where you’ll get
the highest rate of interest?
You would expect the highest rate of interest to be paid by General Motors
(currently a somewhat shaky company). Why? Because lending your money
to GM involves some risk. If GM were to go bankrupt, you might lose a good
chunk of your principal. That risk requires GM to pay a higher rate of inter-
est. Without paying some kind of risk premium, the manufacturer of gas-
guzzling cars simply would not be able to attract any people to lend it money
to make more gas-guzzling cars.
Conversely, the United States government, which has the power to levy taxes
and print money (despite the cries of a few anarchistic nutcases) is not going
bankrupt any time soon. Therefore, U.S. Treasury bonds, which are said to
carry no risk of default, tend to pay relatively modest interest rates.
If Tommy Potts were to come to me for a loan today, needless to say, I
wouldn’t loan him money. Or if I did, I would require a huge risk premium,
along with some kind of collateral (more than his pet turtles). Bonds issued
by the likes of Tommy Potts or General Motors — bonds that carry a rela-
tively high risk of default — are commonly called high-yield or junk bonds.
Bonds issued by solid companies and governments that carry very little risk
of default are commonly referred to as investment-grade bonds.
There are many, many shades of gray in determining the quality and nature of
a bond. It’s not unlike wine tasting in that regard. In Chapter 4, and again in
Chapter 14, I give many specific tips for “tasting” bonds and choosing the
finest vintages for your portfolio.
Recognizing the difference between 
bonds, stocks, and Beanie Babies
Aside from the maturity and the quality of a bond, other factors could weigh
heavily in how well a bond purchase treats you. In the following chapters, 
I introduce you to such bond characteristics as callability, duration, and 
correlation, and I explain how the winds of the economy, and even the whims
of the bond-buying public, can affect the returns of your bond portfolio.
For the moment, I simply wish to point out that, by and large, bonds’ most
salient characteristic — and the one thing that most, but not all bonds share —
is a certain stability and predictability, well above and beyond that of most
other investments. Because you are, in most cases, receiving a steady stream
of income, and because you expect to get your principal back in one piece,
bonds tend to be more conservative investments than, say, stocks, commodi-
ties, or collectibles.
14
Part I: Bond Appetit! 

Is conservative a good thing? Not necessarily. It’s true that many people
(men, mostly) invest their money too aggressively, just as many people
(women, mostly) invest their money too conservatively. The appropriate
portfolio formula depends on what your individual investment goals are. 
I help you to figure that out in Chapters 12 and 13.
By the way, these are not my personal gender stereotypes. Some solid
research shows that males of the human species do tend to invest (and
drive) much more aggressively than do women.
Why Hold Bonds? (Hint: You’ll 
Likely Make Money!)
In the real world, plenty of people own plenty of bonds — but often the
wrong bonds in the wrong amounts and for the wrong reasons. Some people
have too many bonds, making their portfolios too conservative; some have
too few bonds, making their portfolios too volatile; some have taxable bonds
where they should have tax-free bonds; others have tax-free where they
should have taxable bonds. Others are so far out on the limb with shaky
bonds that they may as well be lending money to Tommy Potts.
The first step in building a bond portfolio is having clear investment objec-
tives. (Although I hear it from clients all the time, “I want to make money” is
not a clear investment objective!) I help you to develop clear objectives in
Chapter 2. In the meantime, I want you to consider some of the typical rea-
sons people buy and hold bonds . . . both good and bad.
15
Chapter 1: So You Want to Be a Bondholder
The bond market is HUMONGOUS
How much is invested in bonds worldwide? Are
you holding onto your seat? According to 2006
figures compiled by the Securities Industry and
Financial Markets Association, the total value of
all bonds outstanding worldwide is now slightly
over $61 trillion. That’s equal to about five times
the current gross domestic product of the
United States — the dollar value of all goods
and services produced in this country in an
entire year.
Given that the stock market gets so much more
attention than the bond market, you may be sur-
prised to know that the total value of all stocks
outstanding worldwide is a mere $50 trillion.

Identifying the best reason to 
buy bonds: Diversification
Most people buy bonds because they perceive a need for steady income, and
they think of bonds as the best way to get income without risking principal.
This is one of the most common mistakes investors make: compartmentaliza-
tion. They think of principal and interest as two separate and distinct money
pools. They are not.
Let me explain: Joe Typical buys a bond for $1,000. At the end of six months,
he collects an interest payment (income) of, say, $25. He spends the $25, fig-
uring that his principal (the $1,000) is left intact to continue earning money.
At the same time, Joe buys a stock for $1,000. At the end of six months, the
price of his stock, and therefore the value of his investment, has grown to,
say, $1,025. Does he spend the $25? No way. Joe reckons that spending any
part of the $1,025 is spending principal and will reduce the amount of money
he has left working for him.
In truth, whether Joe spends his “interest” or his “principal,” whether he
spends his “income” or generates “cash flow” from the sale of stock, he is left
with the very same $1,000 in his portfolio.
Thinking of bonds, or bond funds, as the best — or only — source of cash
flow or income can be a mistake.
Bonds are a better source of steady income than stocks because bonds, in
theory (and usually in practice), always pay interest; stocks may or may not
pay dividends and may or may not appreciate in price. Bonds also may be a
logical choice for people who may need a certain sum of money at a certain
point in the future — such as college tuition or cash for a new home — and
can’t risk a loss.
But unless you absolutely need a steady source of income, or a certain sum
at a certain date, bonds may not be such a hot investment because over the
long haul, they tend to return much less than stocks. I revisit this issue, and
talk much more of the differences between stocks and bonds, in Chapter 12.
For now, the point I wish to make is that the far better reason to own bonds,
for most people, is to diversify a portfolio. Bonds tend to zig when stocks zag.
The key to truly successful investing, as I outline in Chapter 11, is to have at
least several different asset classes — different investment animals with differ-
ent characteristics — all of which can be expected to yield positive long-term
return, but which do not all move up and down at the same time.
16
Part I: Bond Appetit! 

Going for the cash
Bonds are not very popular with the get-rich-quick crowd — for good reason.
The only people who get rich off bonds are generally the insiders who trade
huge amounts and can clip the little guy. Nonetheless, certain categories of
bonds — high-yield corporate bonds, for example — have been known to pro-
duce impressive gains.
High-yield bonds may have a role — a limited role — in your portfolio, as I
discuss in Chapter 6. But know up front that high-yield bonds do not offer the
potential long-run return of stocks, and neither do they offer the portfolio
protection of investment-grade bonds. Rather than zigging when the stock
market zags, many high-yield bonds zag right along with your stock portfolio.
Be careful!
There are some high-yield bonds that I prefer over others — bonds that are
held by few people. I recommend those in Chapter 9.
Even high quality, investment-grade bonds are often purchased with the
wrong intentions. Note: The safest bond of all, a U.S. Treasury bond, will not
guarantee your return of principal unless you hold it to maturity. In other words,
if you buy a 20-year bond and you want to know for sure that you’re going to
get your principal back, you had better plan to hold it for 20 years. If you sell
it before it is fully ripe, you may lose a bundle. Bond prices, especially on
long-term bonds — yes, even Uncle Sam’s bonds — can fluctuate greatly! I
discuss the reasons for this fluctuation in Chapter 4.

I also discuss the very complicated and often misunderstood concept of
bond returns. You may buy a 20-year U.S. Treasury bond yielding 6 percent,
and you may hold it for 20 years, to full maturity. And yes, you’ll get your
principal back, but you may actually get far more or far less than 6 percent
interest on your money! It’s complicated, but I explain this variation in a way
you can understand — I promise! — in Chapter 4.
Introducing the Major Players 
in the Bond Market
Every year, millions — yes, literally millions — of bonds are issued by thou-
sands of different governments, government agencies, municipalities, financial
institutions, and corporations. They all pay interest. In many cases, the interest
rates aren’t all that much different from each other. In most cases, the risk of
the issuer defaulting — not paying back your principal — is minute. So why, as
a lender of money, would you want to choose one type of issuer over another?
Glad you asked!
Following are some important considerations about each of the major kinds
of bonds, categorized by who issues them. I’m just going to scratch the sur-
face right now. For a more in-depth discussion, see the five chapters in Part II.
Supporting (enabling?) your Uncle Sam
with Treasury bonds
Politicians like raising money by selling bonds, as opposed to raising taxes,
because voters hate taxes. Of course, when the government issues bonds, it
promises to repay the bond buyers over time. The more bonds the govern-
ment issues, the greater its debt. Voters don’t seem to care much about debt.
The current debt of the United States government is slightly more than $8.6
trillion: almost $30,000 per every man, woman, and child.
The interest payments on that debt, combined with the steady repayment of
principal, are an enormous burden. Of every dollar spent by the U.S. govern-
ment in 2006, approximately eight cents went to the interest payments on
Treasury bonds. In my mind, that’s a bit too much cash, but this is not a polit-
ical book, so I’m not going to tell you how to vote. (Not that you would listen
to me anyway.) From here on, I address only the role that Treasury bonds
may play in your portfolio.
18
Part I: Bond Appetit! 

In Chapter 5, I explain all the many, many kinds of Treasury bonds — from EE
Bonds to I Bonds to TIPS — and the unique characteristics of each. For the
moment, I merely wish to point out that all of them are backed by the “full
faith and credit” of the federal government. Despite its huge debt, the United
States of America is not going bankrupt any time soon. And for that reason,
Treasury bonds are often referred to as “risk-free.” Careful! That does not
mean that the price of Treasury bonds does not fluctuate.
When bonds experts speak of Treasury bonds as having no risk, what they
mean is that the bonds have no credit risk. But Treasury bonds are very
much subject to the other kinds of risk that most other bonds are subject to:
interest rate risk, inflation risk, and reinvestment risk. I discuss these risks in
Chapter 10.
Collecting corporate debt
Bonds issued by for-profit companies are riskier than government bonds but
tend to compensate for that added risk by paying higher rates of interest. 
(If they didn’t pay higher rates of interest, why would you or anyone else
want to take the extra risk?) In recent history, corporate bonds in the aggre-
gate have tended to pay about a percentage point higher than Treasuries of
similar maturity.
As you’ll discover, I am a huge fan of diversification. It is especially important
to diversify when dealing with riskier investments. For that reason, I hate to
see anyone plunk too great a percentage of his or her portfolio into any indi-
vidual corporate bond. Wealthier investors — those with portfolios of $1 mil-
lion or more — can diversify by buying a collection of bonds. Savvy investors
can temper their risks by familiarizing themselves with bond ratings and
researching the issuing companies’ bottom lines. But I generally advocate
bond ownership — especially where it comes to corporate bonds — in bond
funds. I discuss these funds at the end of this chapter and again, in greater
depth, in Chapter 16.
Oh, one more little thing about corporate bonds for the moment: They tend
to get called a lot. That means that the corporation changes its incorporated
mind about wanting your money and suddenly throws it back at you, cancel-
ing the bond. Bond calls can be no fun! They add a heavy dose of unpre-
dictability to what should be a predictable investment. Read all about calls
and other peculiarities of the corporate bond world in Chapter 6.
19
Chapter 1: So You Want to Be a Bondholder

Demystifying those quasi-governmental
agencies
Federal agencies such as Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie
Mac), Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), and Small
Business Administration issue a good chunk of the bonds on the market —
together, about 18 percent of the bonds held by individual households. Such
agencies aren’t quite government and aren’t quite private concerns. They are
government “sponsored,” and in theory, Congress and the Treasury would
serve as protective big brothers if one of these agencies were to take a finan-
cial beating and couldn’t pay off its debt obligations.
Because of their quasi-governmental status, agencies’ bond offerings are gen-
erally considered the next-safest thing to Treasury bonds. As such, the inter-
est paid on these bonds is typically just a smidgen higher than the interest
rate you would get on Treasuries of similar maturity.
I discuss federal agency bonds — the traditional kind of bonds these agen-
cies offer — in Chapter 7. Some bonds issued or guaranteed by the federal
agencies are distinctly nontraditional in that they represent an ownership
interest in pools of mortgages. These are more complicated than traditional
bonds, and I’m sorry to say that many people who invest in them haven’t the
foggiest idea what they’re investing in. More about these babies in Chapter 9.
Going cosmopolitan with 
municipal offerings
The bond market, unlike the stock market, is overwhelmingly institutional. In
other words, the vast majority of bonds are held by insurance companies,
pension funds, endowment funds, and mutual funds. The only exception is
the municipal bond market.
Municipal bonds (munis) are issued by cities, states, and counties. They are
used to raise money either for general day-to-day needs of the citizenry
(schools, roads, sewer systems) or for specific projects (a new bridge, a
sports stadium).
Munis’ popularity with individual investors may be due in small part to the
warm and fuzzy feelings to be had by investing in local infrastructure. But my
guess is that their popularity comes much more from their special tax status.
20
Part I: Bond Appetit! 

Interest on most municipal bonds is exempt from federal income tax. And
even though the interest rates paid are modest, many individual investors,
especially those in the higher tax brackets, can often get a better after-tax
return on municipal bonds than on comparable taxable bonds.
Like corporate bonds, but unlike Treasuries, municipal bonds are often sub-
ject to call. You may think you’re buying a ten-year investment, but you may
be forced to relinquish the bond in two years. (Bond brokers often fail to
advertise this fact to buyers.)
Municipal bonds tend to be less risky than corporate bonds but not as safe
as Treasuries and agency bonds. Just as corporate bonds are given ratings,
so are municipal bonds. It’s important to know before investing whether the
local government issuing the bond has the wherewithal to pay back your
principal. Cities don’t go bankrupt often, but it does happen. I reveal much,
much more on munis in Chapter 8.
Buying Solo or Buying Bulk
One of the big questions about bond investing that I help you to answer later
in this book is whether to invest in individual bonds or bond funds.
I’m a big advocate of bond funds — both bond mutual funds and exchange-
traded funds. Mutual funds and exchange-traded funds both represent bas-
kets of securities (usually stocks or bonds, or both) and allow for instant and
easy portfolio diversification.
21
Chapter 1: So You Want to Be a Bondholder
The household bond market pie
Among the kinds of traditional bonds most pop-
ular with individual investors in the United
States are Treasuries, corporate bonds, bonds
issued by federal agencies, and municipal
bonds. According to the Securities Industry and
Financial Markets Association and the United
States Treasury, as of 2006, U.S. households
held more than $15 trillion of these four kinds of
bonds alone:
 $5.2 trillion in corporate bonds (see Chap-
ter 6)
 $4.9 trillion in Treasuries (see Chapter 5)
 $2.8 trillion in agency bonds (see Chapter 7)
 $2.3 trillion in municipal bonds (see Chap-
ter 8)

I outline the pros and cons of owning individual bonds versus bond funds in
Chapter 14. Here, I give you a very quick sneak preview of that discussion.
Picking and choosing individual bonds
Individual bonds offer investors the opportunity to really fine-tune a fixed-
income portfolio. With individual bonds, you can choose exactly what you
want in terms of bond quality, maturity, and taxability.
For larger investors — especially those doing their homework — investing in
individual bonds may also be more economical than investing in a bond fund.
That’s especially true for those investors up on the latest advances in bond
buying and selling.
Once upon a time, any buyer or seller of individual bonds had to take a giant
leap of faith that his or her bond broker wasn’t trimming too much meat off
the bone. No more. In Chapter 15, I show you how to find out exactly how
much your bond broker is making off you — or trying to make off you. I show
you how to compare comparable bonds to get the best deals. And I discuss
some popular bond strategies, including the most popular and potent one,
laddering your bonds, which means staggering the maturities of the bonds
you buy.
Going with a bond fund or funds
Investors now have a choice of more than 5,000 bond mutual funds or
exchange-traded funds. All have the same basic drawback: management
expenses. But even so, some make for very good potential investments, 
particularly for people with modest portfolios.
Where to begin your fund search? I promise to help you weed out the losers
and pick the very best. As you’ll discover (or as you know already if you have
read my Exchange-Traded Funds For Dummies), I’m a strong proponent of
buying index funds — mutual funds or exchange-traded funds that seek to
provide exposure to an entire asset class (such as bonds or stocks) with very
little trading and very low expenses. I believe that such funds are the way to
go for most investors to get the bond exposure they need. I suggest some
good bond index funds, as well as other bond funds, in Chapter 16.
If you would like to know more about funds in general, I would advise you to
pick up copies of Exchange-Traded Funds For Dummies and the latest edition
of Eric Tyson’s Mutual Funds For Dummies, both published by Wiley.

o you remember the great auto-rental scene in Get Shorty? Mobster Chili
Palmer (John Travolta) travels to L.A., shows up at the auto rental
place, and discovers, to his chagrin, that the only vehicle to be had is an
Oldsmobile minivan.
“What is that?” he asks the rental car attendant, pointing to the curb.
“It’s an Oldsmobile Silhouette.”
“I ordered a Cadillac.”
“Oh, well,” says the attendant, “you got the Cadillac of minivans.”
And off drives the pistol-packing gangster, out to collect mob debt money,
driving the streets of L.A. in a boxy vehicle with built-in child seats and a
rooftop luggage carrier. It’s as incongruous as, well, a pistol-packing gangster
aiming to make the big score by investing in Fannie Mae bonds.
Portfolios, like Cadillacs and minivans, suit certain kinds of personalities. In
order to choose the most appropriate investments — be they bonds, stocks,
or pork-belly futures — it helps to know what kind of person you are. I’m not
talking about knowing yourself in a grand, metaphysical, Freudian or Socratic
sense, but knowing yourself, and perhaps your spouse, at least to the point
that you can formulate some reasonable household financial goals.

24
Part I: Bond Appetit! 
Unlike all the other chapters in this book, this chapter does not focus
squarely on bonds. Rather, it sets the stage for a full discussion of bonds by
helping you first figure out what kind of investor you are (Chili Palmer,
Warren Buffett, or Nervous Nelly?) and whether a Fannie Mae bond portfolio
may suit you better than, say, dropping your savings into casino stocks, ura-
nium futures, or hush money. I also discuss some very fundamental invest-
ment principles, such as reversion to the mean and the cold-clay link
between risk and return.
The investment principles I present in this chapter pertain to all financial
investments, bonds included. If you’re a seasoned investor, you may already
be familiar with these market truths. But a quick review certainly couldn’t
hurt.
Focusing on Your Objectives
Investing in a portfolio of Fannie Mae bonds is a moderately conservative
way to go. (See Chapter 7 for more on Fannie Maes, Ginnie Maes, and 
various other federal agency bonds.) You very likely won’t get rich investing
in these — or most other kinds of bonds. But at 2 a.m., when you get up to go
to the bathroom, you’ll know where your money is, and you can go back to
sleep with ease.
On the other hand, investing your savings in the stock of a single, small tech-
nology company can indeed make you rich. (Think Microsoft back when a
nerdy, young Bill Gates was working out of his garage.) But you may also
wake up Thursday morning and find that your investment is worth a fraction
of what it was on Wednesday. (Think any great number of tech stocks, both
large and small, in the dark and financially dismal days of 2001 and 2002.)
For most people, some kind of in-between portfolio, perhaps with Fannie Mae
bonds and tech stocks, would make the most sense. But you need to decide
whether you want to be smack in the middle of the continuum or whether
you care to hang your hat more toward the mild side or the wild side. That
decision will have a great bearing on just how much you wind up stocking up
on bonds or bonding with stocks.
Deciding what you want 
to be when you grow up
The kind of portfolio you want to build depends on what you want to get out
of it, be it immediate income, slow and steady appreciation, or pop-goes-the-
weasel kind of growth.

Are you looking to quit your day job as soon as possible and start a second
career writing haiku poetry? Are you seeking to pay the kids’ college bills and
worry about building your retirement nest egg after that point? Do you want
to drop out of society after the kids are grown, buy a 52-foot sailboat, and
travel the Caribbean from island to island? These are the kinds of questions
you need to ask yourself.
Fortunately, you don’t need to be all that specific in your future goals to for-
mulate a fairly good financial plan. You merely need to be somewhat clear
about how much you and your partner will likely be earning (if anything) and
how much you will likely be spending over a certain period of time.
Our society has changed much in the last generation, and very many
Boomers nearing traditional retirement age aren’t looking for anything even
closely resembling a traditional retirement. Me, I love what I do and hope to
continue doing it for as long as I’m capable. (However, I wouldn’t mind clock-
ing fewer hours and, after the kids have grown, taking a few more trips to
places like Greece and Morocco.)
Picturing your future nest egg
In Chapter 12, I give you the tools to help you fine-tune your retirement goals
and figure out what lump sum you will likely need, given the kind of lifestyle
you envision, to replace your weekly paycheck. But for now, I’m just going to
share some very loose guidelines.
It doesn’t much matter whether you are like me and intend to keep working
past traditional retirement age or whether you want a more old-fashioned
retirement (complete with checkered pants, green golf shirts, blue hair, and
mah-jongg games). Most financial planners suggest that your ultimate savings
goal be something in the order of 20 times your annual anticipated expenses,
minus any income from Social Security, pension, or part-time employment.
In other words, if you think you’ll need $50,000 a year to live on at age 65 or
so, and you anticipate yearly income of $20,000 from a combination of Social
Security payments and, say, hobby income, your goal should be to grow a
nest egg worth at least $600,000. ($50,000 – $20,000 = $30,000. $30,000 × 20 =
$600,000.)
Understanding the Rule of 20
Before I explain the (rough . . . very rough) Rule of 20, let me first say that
that number may scare the heck out of you if you haven’t put much away so
far, but it shouldn’t scare you all that much.
25
Chapter 2: Developing Your Investment Game Plan

Remember that compound interest is a very, very powerful force. Someone
starting to save at age 30, investing wisely in a diversified portfolio, would
likely have to put aside only about $250 a month to have a darned good
chance of building a $600,000 nest egg by age 65. If the 30-year-old had a job
where the employer matched his 401(k) contributions by kicking in 50 per-
cent on top of whatever he put in, $167 a month would do the trick.
Okay, so where does the multiplier of 20 come from? It simply gives an
approximation of what you should have by age 65 to spend what you need
every year, live an average lifespan (mid 80s), and have a pretty good chance
of not running out of money before you die. Obviously, if you can save more,
so much the better.
If you think that you may live longer than the average lifespan, or if you’re
planning to quit work before age 65, you should plan to save more than 
20 times your annual living expenses. The longer you plan a life of ease, 
the more money you’ll need to tap.
For those of us who would like to keep working as long as we can, there’s still
nothing whatsoever wrong with financial independence, so I would advocate
the same financial goal. Again, I’m talking rough estimate here, and I can’t
emphasize that enough. But I need to throw out some kind of estimate so as
to illustrate how your nest egg goals have everything to do with how heavily
you invest in bonds.
Choosing your investment style
Okay, what does the Rule of 20 have to do with your choice of investments
and the wisdom of holding bonds? Simple: The further away you are from
achieving that financial goal, the higher the rate of savings you need or the
higher the rate of return you require from your portfolio — or both.
In Chapter 12, I try to answer the very difficult question, “What percent of
your portfolio should be in bonds?” For now, I simply want to point out that
people who need a higher rate of return generally don’t want too bond-laden
a portfolio. A heavy position in bonds is more appropriate for investors who
don’t need a lot of growth but, rather, can sit back and enjoy steady but slow
growth.
Say, for example, you are 55 or 60 years old and, thanks to your good savings
habits, you are now on the cusp of having your “20x” portfolio. If much of
that portfolio is now in stocks or stock mutual funds, it may be time for you
to start shifting a good chunk of your portfolio into bonds. Why take much
risk with things like stocks or commodities if you don’t need to?
26
Part I: Bond Appetit! 

Be aware, however, that simple portfolio-construction formulas (that typi-
cally use age as a main determinant) often don’t work! I’m giving you some
very rough rules just to get you thinking about how I think in terms of invest-
ment allocation. As I explain in Chapter 12, that same 55- or 60-year-old
investor who may want to shift more of his or her portfolio to bonds may
actually want to shift back to stocks 20 years later if the portfolio is worth
millions.
Making Your Savings and 
Investment Selections
Yes, you can shove your money under the mattress, but with inflation cur-
rently running about 3 percent a year, $1,000 in today’s dollars will have only
about $940 in purchasing power two years from now and $860 in purchasing
power five years from now. Economists call that loss in purchasing power
inflation risk, and it is indeed a very real kind of risk. Moral of the story: Don’t
keep money under the mattress. You have to do something with it.
In my mind, savings refers to money socked away that is perhaps growing fast
enough to keep up with inflation, or slightly more. Investments refers to
money socked away that is projected to grow significantly faster than the
rate of inflation.
The whole point of investing is to earn a real return, which is to say the rate
of return after inflation. If your nominal return is 8 percent but inflation is 5
percent, your real return is approximately 3 percent (8% – 5% = 3%). Getting a
nominal return of 2 percent when there is no inflation is much better than
getting a 15 percent return when the inflation rate is 20!
Different types of bonds can fall into either category: savings or investments.
Some bonds — like U.S. savings bonds — generally keep about even with
inflation. Other bonds, such as high-yield corporate bonds, usually keep you
well ahead of the game.
In general, money that may be needed in the upcoming months, or even a few
years down the pike, should be kept in safe savings; you can’t risk a loss of
principal. (Yes, loss of principal is possible with most bonds, especially long-
term bonds. You discover why in Chapter 4.) Money that you most likely
won’t need for many years to come should be invested for growth; even if
there is a loss of principal, you will likely make that back, and then some,
before you require any withdrawals.
Following are some of the most popular options for saving and investing,
which I briefly compare and contrast with bond investing.
27
Chapter 2: Developing Your Investment Game Plan

Saving your money in safety
With the following savings options, the principal is guaranteed (or close to
guaranteed), and the rate of return should keep you even with or slightly
ahead of the inflation game:
 Your local savings bank: There’s something to be said for keeping at
least a small balance at the neighborhood bank. I do. Need a loan some-
day? It may be easier if you are a regular customer. Local businesses are
also more likely to accept a check drawn on a local bank. Then there’s
the “bank experience,” which may be especially important if you’re a
parent. Each of my two children has a saving account at the corner bank,
and they love going there for the free plate of cookies.
At all savings banks in the United States, deposits are insured up to
$100,000 by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Even if
the bank goes under, you’re covered. The interest rates paid by local
banks tend to be very modest, more modest than those paid by most
bonds.
 Certificates of Deposit (CDs): The longer you’re willing to commit your
money to the bank, the higher the interest rate. Generally a 6-month CD
may pay an interest point more than passbook savings, a 12-month CD
may pay a bit more, and an 18-month CD yet a wee bit more. If you have
one to several thousand dollars sitting around, perhaps you might put
one-third into each. That way, you’re not tying up all your money for the
entire time, and if interest rates go higher in six months, you’ll be free to
take part of your money and upgrade to a higher-yielding CD.

Home sweet home
Yes, of course, home equity represents a form
of savings. It is also your most illiquid savings.
(Liquidity refers to the ease with which you can
cash out on an investment, if you need to.) You
need a place to live . . . and you always will. So
for your home to ever do you much good as a
store of value, you’ll need to downsize. At that
point, you can sell the more expensive home,
pick up a cheaper abode (or rent one), and
pocket the difference.
Home values don’t often drop appreciably, but
they certainly can. I had an aunt who once had
an expensive home in Northridge, California —
epicenter of the huge 1994 earthquake. Over-
night, it lost its status as an expensive home!

manager and see if you can negotiate something higher than the adver-
tised rate. CD rates are usually comparable to very short-term bonds but
are not on a par with longer-term bonds.
 Internet banking: Consider opening an account with a Web-based, 
FDIC-insured savings bank, such as www.emigrantdirect.com or
www.ingdirect.com. The rates on savings accounts are often compa-
rable to one-year CDs, and you don’t need to tie up your money at all.
 Money market funds: Money market mutual funds are not insured by
the FDIC so they aren’t quite as safe as bank accounts or U.S. savings
bonds, but they are almost as safe. They tend to offer a slightly higher
return than bank accounts but not as much as a bond portfolio. If you
hold one of these funds outside of your retirement account, you may
want to choose a tax-free money market fund, especially if you are in a
higher tax bracket.
Note that with money market funds, your principal is secure but the
interest rate is not; it can, and often does, vary from day to day. That’s
just the opposite of a bond, by the way: With a bond, your interest rate
is fixed, but the value of your principal can vary day to day. (I explain
this in Chapter 4.)
 Short-term, high quality bonds: Short-term bond mutual funds and
exchange-traded funds, both taxable and tax-free, are similar to money
market funds and often pay a bit more. Read all about them, and how to
choose the best one for your portfolio, in Chapters 13 and 16.
Investing your money with 
an eye toward growth
By sinking your savings into investments such as the ones I list here — 
carefully! — your payoff can be handsome. But, of course, you can also lose
money.
 Company stocks: Whereas bonds represent a loan you are making to a
company or government, stocks represent partial ownership in a com-
pany. Over the long run, few investments pay off as well as stocks, which
have an 80-year track record of returning about 10 percent a year —
about twice the return of bonds.
The problem with stocks is that they can be extremely volatile, perhaps
going up 20 percent one year and tumbling 20 percent the next. You can
somewhat reduce that volatility by holding a wide variety of different
29
Chapter 2: Developing Your Investment Game Plan

kinds of stocks, most easily done with stock mutual funds or exchange-
traded funds (which, like mutual funds, represent baskets of securities
but, unlike mutual funds, trade like stocks). You can also temper the
volatility of a stock portfolio by blending into that portfolio certain other
kinds of investments — such as bonds — that tend to hold their own, or
may even head north, when stocks head south.
 Gold and other commodities: In the past, commodities — gold, silver,
oil, wheat, coffee — have been very difficult to invest in and extremely
volatile. The volatility is still there, but commodities have lately become
very easy to invest in. Barclays Bank, for example, offers something
called exchange-traded notes (ETNs), which are similar to exchange-
traded funds and track a broad index of commodities. (For more infor-
mation, see www.ipathetn.com.)
Like bonds, commodities tend to hold their own, or even go up, when
stocks go down. Over the past 35 years, commodity investors overall
have seen slightly higher returns than have stock investors.
Commodities tend to increase value over time because the world is
becoming an awfully crowded place, with more and more people con-
suming limited resources.
 Investment real estate: Whether you invest in apartments to rent, or
shopping centers, or office space, there’s money to be made in invest-
ment real estate. (Like commodities, real estate is a limited resource.)
However, tending to real estate, as any landlord knows, can be a lot of
work. And some tenants tend to be real pains in the butt — calling you
at midnight to fix a leaky faucet! Real estate investment trusts (REITs)
operate much like stocks and let you enjoy the fruits of others’ labors,
profiting merely by depositing your money. (No leaky faucets!) Of
course, as with stocks, there’s risk involved — more so than there is
with most bond offerings. REITs, like stocks, are best purchased in the
form of a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund. Dozens of REIT funds are
offered by most brokerage houses. See Chapter 17 for more info.
 Entrepreneurial ventures: Open a restaurant . . . a dry cleaning shop . . .
a dance studio . . . a gas station. Several million Americans have the bulk
of their savings invested in small businesses. You’re in control that way,
and there’s a chance that your small business could go big. But running
a business requires tons of work, and there’s always a risk that profits
won’t materialize. When small businesspeople come into my office, I cer-
tainly try not to discourage them from growing their businesses, but I
also advise funneling some money toward other investments, such as
bonds and stocks. Yes, diversification is good for the entrepreneur as
well as the employee.

Understanding Five Major 
Investment Principles
When I first became a serious student of investments, I was amazed at how
much hard, academic research existed. Most of it contradicts anything and
everything you’ve ever been told about investments by the magazines and
books that shout “Get Rich Now!” or “Five Hot Stocks for the New Year!” If
you know nothing else about investing, know the following five eternal, essen-
tial investment truths — all real-world tested — and you’ll be way, way ahead
of the game.
1. Risk and return are two 
sides of the same coin
If you see an investment that has gained 50 percent in the last year, sure, at
least consider taking a position. But know this: Any investment that goes up
50 percent in a year can just as easily go down 50 percent in a year. That’s the
nature of the investment world.
31
Chapter 2: Developing Your Investment Game Plan
What about whole life insurance, 
variable annuities, and such?
I’ve seen insurance salespeople so good that
they could sell sand to a Saudi. I’ve been
pitched all kinds of insurance products, and
they sound great — absolutely wonderful —
until I actually get back to my office, start
punching numbers, and look for cracks in the
salesperson’s pitch. Those cracks are always
there. I’m not saying that insurance people are
bad or insurance companies are bad — not at
all. Insurance is a necessary part of modern life.
As a general rule, however — and a very good
general rule — insurance products and invest-
ment products should remain separate and dis-
tinct. Is a variable annuity or a whole life
insurance policy ever a good thing? Yes, I sup-
pose. But very rarely. More often, purchasers of
such hybrid investment/insurance products wind
up angry and upset with their purchases —
especially when they find out that there’s no
going back without forfeiting a good chunk of
their original investment in exorbitant surrender
fees.

Risk and return go together like fire and oxygen. Short-term, high quality
bonds bring modest returns but bear little risk. Long-term, low quality bonds
bring more handsome returns but bear considerable risk. Lower quality
bonds must offer greater potential for return or no one but maybe a few
loonies would invest in them. Higher quality bonds must offer lower rates of
return or so many investors would flock to them that the price would be bid
up (which would effectively lower the rate of return).
2. Financial markets are largely efficient
If someone says to you that a certain investment is “guaranteed” to return 
30 percent a year with no risk, you are being lied to. Financial markets are
efficient, which means that thousands upon thousands of buyers, sellers,
fund managers, and market analysts are constantly out there looking for the
best deals. If a truly safe investment were to offer a guaranteed return of 
30 percent, so many people would make offers to buy that investment that
the price would surely be bid up . . . and the return would then drop.
The efficiency of the markets is why even so few professional investors can
beat the indexes. In numerous studies — each supporting the findings of the
others — actively managed mutual funds (funds whose managers try to pick
stocks or bonds that will outperform all others) very rarely manage to beat
the indexes. Over the course of a decade or more, the number is infinitesi-
mally small, and even those chosen few fail to beat the indexes by very much.
In Chapter 16, I tell you where to find the best bond index funds — funds that
try to capture the returns of the entire market rather than attempting in vain
to beat the market.
3. Diversification is just about the 
only free lunch you’ll ever get
So if you can’t pick certain securities that will outperform, how can you
become a better investor than the next guy? Not that hard, really. Keep your
costs low. Keep your taxes minimal. Don’t trade often. Most importantly,
diversify your portfolio across several asset classes — different kinds of
investments, such as bonds, stocks, and commodities — so that all the com-
ponents can contribute to your returns. Because the components move up
and down at different times, the volatility of your entire portfolio is kept to a
minimum.
32
Part I: Bond Appetit! 

In Chapter 11, I discuss something called Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT). The
essence of MPT is this: You can add a highly volatile (high risk, high return)
investment to a portfolio, and — if that investment tends to zig while other
investments in your portfolio zag — you can actually lower the volatility (and
risk) of the entire portfolio. So who says there’s no such thing as a free lunch?
4. Reversion to the mean — 
it means something
Sometimes called reversion to the mean, sometimes called regression to the
mean, what it means is that most things in this world — from batting aver-
ages to inches of rainfall to investment returns — tend over time to revert
back to their historical averages.
Suppose, for example, that a certain kind of investment (say, intermediate-
term Fannie Mae bonds) showed extraordinary returns for the last two to
three years (say 18 percent a year). (That kind of return on a bond would be
rare, but it does happen, and I explain how in Chapter 4.) We know from the
past several decades that intermediate-term, high quality bonds such as
Fannie Maes typically return about one-third as much. Would you be well
advised to assume that Fannie Mae bonds will continue to earn 18 percent for
the next two years?
In fact, most investors assume just that. They look at recent returns of a cer-
tain asset class and assume that those recent returns will continue. In other
words, most fresh investment money pours into “hot” investment sectors.
And this often spells tragedy for those who don’t understand the concept of
reversion to the mean. In reality, hot sectors often turn cold — and they are
generally to be avoided.
In fact, if anything, you might expect an asset class that overperforms for sev-
eral years to underperform in the upcoming years. Why? Because all invest-
ments (like batting averages and inches of rainfall) have a tendency to return
to their historical average return.
To look at it another way, investments tend to move in and out of favor in
cycles. It is hard, if not impossible, to imagine that any one investment that
historically has yielded modest returns would suddenly, for any extended
period of time, become a major moneymaker. That would be akin to the
Oldsmobile minivan suddenly becoming the favored vehicle of pistol-packing
mobsters.
33
Chapter 2: Developing Your Investment Game Plan

5. Investment costs matter — 
and they matter a lot!
Oh, sure, 1 percent doesn’t sound like a prodigious sum, but the difference
between investing in a bond mutual fund that charges 1.50 percent annually
in management fees and one that charges 0.50 percent is enormous. Over the
course of the next ten years, assuming gross returns of 5 percent, com-
pounded annually, a $20,000 investment in the more expensive fund would
leave you, after paying the fund company, with $28,212. That same invest-
ment in the less expensive fund would leave you with $31,059 — a difference
of $2,847.
Of course, fund companies that charge more tend to have a lot of money to
spend on advertising, and they do a great job conning the public into think-
ing that their funds are somehow worth the extra money. That is rarely, rarely
true. In Chapter 16, I include a sidebar on mutual bond-fund advertising,
explaining how mediocre funds are often dolled up to look much better than
they are.
Studies galore show that the investors who keep their costs to a minimum do
best. That’s especially true with bonds, where the returns tend to be more
modest than with stocks. Whether you are buying bond funds or purchasing
individual bonds, transaction costs and operating expenses need to be mini-
mized. That’s largely what Chapters 14 through 16 of this book are all about.

Chapter 3
The (Often, but Not Always) Heroic
History of Bonds
In This Chapter
 Examining bonds’ successes and failures
 Appreciating the role of bonds in the history of civilization
 Recognizing the role bonds play in today’s financial markets
 Investigating how bond investing continues to evolve
F
or some people, success in life means owning a Rolls Royce. For others,
it means having someone to love. And for still others it could mean leav-
ing a legacy. Winston Churchill once quipped that success in life is the ability
to move from one mistake to the next without losing enthusiasm. Perhaps he
was right.
You can’t deny that “success in life” means different things to different
people. But what about “success in investing”? That, too, is a somewhat sub-
jective term. Consider investment returns over the past 80 years or so. By
some counts, bonds, at least from the investor’s vantage point, have been 
a lamentable failure — the veritable Edsel of investments. By other counts,
bonds have been a reigning success — a Rolls Royce with a full tank and a
fresh wax job.
In this chapter, I explain that puzzling contradiction. I take you back in time
beyond 80 years . . . way back to the Middle Ages to explore the role of bonds
before there was even a printing press. I give you some perspective on how
bond markets evolved — and continue to evolve. And, as I escort you into
the present era, I describe how the bond market has changed enormously for
the better, making bonds both easier to invest in and potentially more prof-
itable than ever before.

Reviewing the Triumphs and Failures 
of Fixed-Income Investing
Picture yourself in the year 1926. Calvin Coolidge occupies the White House.
Ford’s Model T can be bought for $200. Charles Lindbergh is gearing up to 
fly across the Atlantic. And you, having just arrived from your journey back
in time, brush the time-travel dust off your shoulders and reach into your
pocket. You figure that if you invest $100, you can then return to the present,
cash in on your 80-year-old investment, and live like a corrupt king. So you
plunk down the $100 into some long-term government bonds.
Fast-forward to the present, and you discover that your original investment
of $100 is now worth $7,200. It grew at an average compound rate of return 
of 5.5 percent. (In fact, that’s just what happened in the real world.) Even
though you aren’t rich, $7,200 doesn’t sound too shabby. But you need to
look at the whole picture.
Beating inflation, but not by very much
Yes, you enjoyed a return of 5.5 percent a year, but while your bonds were
making money, inflation was eating it away . . . at a rate of about 3.0 percent a
year. What that means is that your $7,200 is really worth only about $700 in
1926 dollars. Your investment, in real dollars (inflation-adjusted dollars),
actually grew seven times.
To put that another way, your real (after-inflation) yearly rate of return for
long-term government bonds was only 2.4 percent. In half of the 80 years,
your bond investment either didn’t grow at all in real dollar terms or actually
lost money.
Compare that scenario to an investment in stocks. Had you invested the very
same $100 in 1926 in the S&P 500 (500 of the largest U.S. company stocks),
your investment would have grown to $2,385,000 in nominal (pre-inflation)
dollars. In 1926 dollars, that would be $240,000. The average nominal return
was 10.4 percent, and the average real annual rate of return for the bundle of
stocks was 7.2 percent. (Those rates ignore income taxes.)
So? Which would you rather have invested in: stocks or bonds? Obviously,
stocks were the way to go. In comparison, bonds seem to have failed to pro-
vide adequate return.

Saving the day when the 
day needed saving
But hold on! There’s another side to the story! Yes, stocks clobbered bonds
over the course of the last 80 years. But who makes an investment and leaves
it untouched for 80 years? Rip Van Winkle, maybe. But outside of fairy tale
characters, no one! Real people in the real world usually invest for much
shorter periods. And there have been some shorter periods over the past 
80 years when stocks have taken some stomach-wrenching falls.
The worst of all falls, of course, was during the Great Depression that began
with the stock market crash of 1929. Any money that your grandparents may
have had in the stock market in 1929 was worth not even half as much four
years later. Over the next decade, stock prices would go up and down, but
Grandma and Grandpa wouldn’t see their $100 back until about 1943. Had
they planned to retire in that period, well . . . they may have had to sell a few
apples on the street just to make ends meet.
A bond portfolio, however, would have helped enormously. Had Grandma and
Grandpa had a diversified portfolio of, say, 70 percent stocks and 30 percent
long-term government bonds, they would have been pinched by the Great
Depression but not destroyed. While $70 of stock in 1929 was worth only $33
four years later; $30 in long-term government bonds would have been worth
$47. All told, instead of having a $100 all-stock portfolio fall to $46, their 70/30
diversified portfolio would have fallen only to $80. Big difference!
Closer to home, a $10,000 investment in the S&P 500 at the beginning of 2000
was worth only $5,800 after three years of a growly bear market. But during
those same three years, long-term U.S. government bonds soared. A $10,000
70/30 (stock/bond) portfolio during those three years would have been worth
$8,210 at the end. Another big difference!
Clearly, long-term government bonds can, and often do, rise to the challenge
during times of economic turmoil. Why are bad times often good for many
bonds? I explain the reasons for this phenomenon in Chapters 4 and 5. For
now, know that bonds have historically been a best friend to investors at
those times when investors have most needed a friend. Given that bonds
have saved numerous stock investors from impoverishment, bond investing
in the past eight decades may be seen not as a miserable failure but as a huge
success.

Whatever happened to Grandpa’s bearer bonds?
For years, bonds were issued as certificates —
many of them genuine works of art — called
bearer bonds. Quite simply, if you had the cer-
tificate in your hands, the bond was yours, and
the attached coupons (generally good for six
months’ interest) could be turned in for cold
cash. Your name appeared nowhere on the
bond, nor in the company’s records. If you
earned any interest, the IRS expected you to
voluntarily report it and pay the appropriate tax.
The 20-year bearer bond shown here was
issued by the General Electric Company in 1956,
carried a face value of $1,000, and bore coupons
redeemable every six months for $17.50 each.
Needless to say, the IRS was not a big fan of
bearer bonds, and in 1982, it became illegal for
any corporation or municipality to issue them.
With the sole exception of U.S. savings bonds,
bonds have been issued electronically since
that time, and anonymity is no longer possible.
You own the bond. The brokerage house has
your name. You pay the tax.
On the up side, today’s bonds, unlike bearer
bonds, cannot be stolen or lost in a fire. Today,
your ownership of a bond is registered in cyber-
space and protected from thievery or flames.

Looking Back Over a Long and 
(Mostly) Distinguished Past
Whether or not we deem bonds a success in the 20th century, if we go back
in time to the 19th century, the track record seems more clear. Not only were
bonds a source of stability during most of the 1800s, but the difference in
returns between stocks and bonds wasn’t nearly so great as it became in
later years.
Although the data from over 100 years ago isn’t quite as solid as it is today,
most economists believe that bonds in the United States returned to investors
an average of about 5 percent a year throughout the 1800s, versus roughly 6.5
percent a year for stocks. Inflation was quite low prior to 1900, so nominal and
real returns were largely one and the same.
If you consider the inherently large volatility of stocks (probably similar 100
years ago to today), it would seem that bonds were perhaps the better invest-
ment during the early industrial age.
In trying to predict future returns of bonds and stocks, most investors today
look at data only from the 20th century and assume that the returns for
stocks and bonds moving forward will be similar to what they’ve been.
However, when making predictions, it may be helpful to note that financial
markets were quite active prior to 1900 . . . even prior to 1800! In fact, bonds
have been issued in Europe for hundreds of years (looking rather similar to
the way they look today).
Yielding returns to generations 
of your ancestors
Notre Dame, the Leaning Tower of Pisa, the Palace at Versailles, the Tower 
of London . . . our medieval European ancestors knew how to create things
with lasting power. When the Venetian government of the 13th century issued
bonds, it didn’t issue the 10- or 20-year bonds that are popular today. It didn’t
issue 50- or 100-year bonds that were popular in 1800s, either. No, the Venetian
prestiti was a bond designed to pay interest forever, without ever paying off
the principal.
The prestiti paid 5 percent interest a year, payable — like most bonds today —
in two annual installments. Also like most bonds today, it was not issued in cer-
tificate form. Rather, the bondholders had their claims registered in a central
location: the city’s loan office. Prestiti could be bought and sold on the open
market and, depending on prevailing interest rates of the day, might sell at a dis-
count or a premium of the face value of the loan — just as bonds trade today.

Buy war bonds!
Even before the United States entered World
War II, a massive effort was underway to raise
money to build the military and support our allies
in war-torn Europe and Asia. At the heart of the
fundraising effort was the creation of war bonds.
In April 1941, with great fanfare, President
Franklin D. Roosevelt purchased the very first
such bond from Secretary of the Treasury Henry
Morgenthau, Jr. Posters (such as the ones
shown here), radio commercials, newspaper
advertisements, and newsreels in theaters
spread the word that purchasing a bond was the
patriotic thing to do. The government made it
easy to invest by issuing cards with slots 
for quarters. When a person collected 75 
quarters — $18.75 — he or she could bring the
card into any post office and receive a $25 bond
redeemable in ten years (with no actual interest
payments in the interim).That worked out to 2.9
percent annual compound interest — consider-
ably lower than prevailing rates at the time. More
than six out of ten U.S. citizens bought war
bonds, almost $200 billion was raised (which
would be about 12 times as much in today’s dol-
lars), and Hitler and Hirohito got what was
coming to them.
a
b

Confidence in the prestiti led to its use as a medium of exchange throughout
Medieval Europe and helped Venice grow into the most prosperous city of
the era. In later years, as England and France became dominant powers, they,
too, issued bonds that never matured. The Brits called theirs consols, and the
French (who, appropriately enough, backed their bonds with a tax on wine)
called theirs rentes.
Venice continued to pay off the interest on its prestiti until the early 1500s
and only stopped when Venice was pretty much destroyed in a series of wars
with the Turks. Britain and France, although no longer issuing consols and
rentes, still issue bonds today, as do most other nations. Governments gener-
ally sell more bonds when they need more cash to pay the bills. Historically,
governments have needed the most cash in times of war. The United States
became a major issuer of bonds during World War II, and the sale of war
bonds, historians agree, helped to finance the Allied victory.
Gleaning some important lessons
Bonds have been a bulwark of portfolios throughout much of modern history,
but that’s not to say that money — some serious money — hasn’t been lost.
Corporate bonds — generally considered the most risky kind of bonds — did
not become popular in the United States until after the Civil War, when many
railroads, experiencing a major building boom, found a sudden need for capi-
tal. During a depression in the early to mid 1890s, a good number of those
railroads went bankrupt, taking many bondholders down with them. During
the Great Depression of the 1930s, plenty of companies of all sorts went
under, and many corporate bondholders again took it on the chin.
In more recent years, the global bond default rate has been less than 1 per-
cent a year. But still, that equates to several dozen companies a year. In the
past few years, a number of airlines (Delta, Northwest), energy companies
(Enron), and one auto parts company (Delphi) have defaulted on their bonds.
General Motors and Ford both saw big downgrades on their bonds (from
investment-grade to speculative-grade, terms I explain in Chapter 4), costing
bondholders (especially those who needed to cash out of their bondhold-
ings) many millions.
Municipal bonds, although much safer overall than corporate bonds, have
also seen a few defaults. In 1978, Cleveland became the first major U.S. city to
default on its bonds since the Great Depression. Three years prior, New York
City likely would have defaulted on its bonds had the federal government not
come to the rescue.
41
Chapter 3: The (Often, but Not Always) Heroic History of Bonds

The largest default in the history of the municipal bond market was that of the
Washington Public Power Supply System (WPPSS, known informally as
“Whoops”). In 1982, bond investors lost out on $2.25 billion following the
municipal corporation’s failed program to build five nuclear power plants in
Washington to supply electricity to the Pacific Northwest. Only one of the five
planned nuclear plants was ever completed. Investors got seriously nuked.
On the national level (government-issued bonds are often called sovereign
bonds), perhaps the largest default of all time occurred in 1917 as revolution-
aries in Russia were attempting to free the people by breaking the bonds of
imperialist oppression. Bonds were broken, for sure; with the collapse of the
czarist regime, billions and billions of rubles worth of Russian bonds were
suddenly worth less than nonalcoholic vodka. Most had been sold to Western
Europeans. In France, where the Parisian government urged people to buy
Russian bonds to support the monarchy, it is estimated that about half of all
households held at least some Russian debt.
Sometimes history repeats . . . or at least echoes. One of the largest bond
defaults of the modern era was again born in Moscow. It was 1998, and the
Russian government, facing a collapse of its currency, stopped payment on
about $40 billion of bonds. In 2002, Argentina paid 25 cents on the dollar for
its outstanding bond debt of $90 billion.
As I discuss in Chapter 9, bonds of emerging-market nations, such as Russia,
Argentina, Mexico, and Turkmenistan, have been one of the hottest invest-
ment sectors in the past several years. The returns of late have been phe-
nomenal, but how quickly people forget the past! Those bonds can be very
volatile, and investing in them means risking your principal.
Realizing How Crucial Bonds Are Today
I could talk about the importance of corporate debt to the growth of the
economy, the way in which municipal bonds help to repair roads and build
bridges, and how Ginnie Mae and Fannie Mae bonds help to provide housing
to the masses, but I think I’ll just let this one sentence suffice. This is, after
all, not a book on macroeconomics and social policy but a book on personal
investing. So allow me to address the crucial role that bonds play in the lives
of individual investors — people like me and you.
With $15 trillion invested in bonds, U.S. households’ economic welfare is
closely tied to the fortunes of the bond market.
I would argue that with the demise of the traditional pension, bond investing
is more important than ever. Back when you knew your company would take
care of you in old age, you may have played footloose and fancy free with
your portfolio without having to worry that a scrambled nest egg might mean
42
Part I: Bond Appetit! 

you couldn’t afford to buy eggs. Today, a well-tuned portfolio — that almost
certainly includes a good helping of bonds — can make the difference
between living on Easy Street and living on the street.
Keep in mind that most of the money in the bond market today is institu-
tional money. Should you have a life insurance policy, chances are that your
life insurance company has most of your future payoff invested in bonds.
Should you have money in your state’s prepaid college tuition program,
chances are that your money is similarly indirectly invested in bonds. Should
you be one of the fortunate persons whose company still offers a pension,
chances are that your company has your future pension payout invested in
bonds.
In total, more than $60 trillion is invested in bonds worldwide (see Figure 3-1),
and the amount is growing year by year. Many economists speculate that as
the Boomer generation retires, the demand for income-generating investments
like bonds will only grow. If you live and work in a developed nation, your eco-
nomic well-being is much more closely tied to the bond markets than you
think!

Need a hobby? Try scripophily
The term scripophily (pronounced scrip awful
lee) derives from a contest held by the Financial
Times newspaper in 1978 to come up with an
appropriate name for collecting antique stocks
and bonds. Bob Kerstein, CEO of Scripophily.
com, estimates that the hobby boasts 20,000 to
30,000 enthusiasts in the United States alone.
Kerstein’s Web site features more than 12,000
old certificates from various nations, industries,
and eras. Many of them are works of art, some
even featuring paintings from famous artists of
their day. But the vast majority of the old stocks
and bonds have one thing in common, says
Kerstein: “They may be valuable as collector
items, but they are worthless as securities.” He
says he has seen scams whereby con artists try
to sell old, retired bonds at face value (typically
$1,000) to unknowing investors. “Those old
bonds may look like they’re still redeemable, but
they are not,” he warns.
The bond shown here, issued by the Southern
Life Insurance and Trust Company of Florida
Territory in 1839, is one of the oldest corporate
bond issues known. This $1,000 bond, paying 
8 percent, was signed by the governor of the
territory. It was payable in either U.S. dollars or
British pounds.

Viewing Recent Developments, 
Largely for the Better
As the price of everything from groceries and gas to college tuition and medi-
cal care continues to climb, it’s nice to know that at least two things on this
planet have gotten cheaper in the past few years: computers and bond
trades. And, as any seasoned bond investor will tell you, saving money on
trades isn’t the only exciting development of late. Here are some others
worth noting:
 New and better bond funds: According to Morningstar, there are now
roughly 5,000 bond funds in which to invest. Of these, 50 are bond index
funds — funds that seek to capture the returns of an entire swatch of 
the bond market — which, from my vantage point, tend to be the best
options for most bond investors. These funds carry an average yearly
expense ratio of 40 basis points (40/100 of 1 percent), which is way, way
less than most bond funds.
The newest kid on the block, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) — index
funds similar to mutual funds, but in some ways better — are the great-
est thing to happen to bond investing in a very long time. As of this
printing, there are 30 bond ETFs in which to invest. Some of them, such
as several Treasury-bond ETF offerings from Vanguard, carry expense
ratios of a mere 11 basis points (11/100 of 1 percent). I discuss these
Vanguard ETFs, and other top fund picks, in Chapter 16.
 Greater access to information: One of the advantages of exchange-
traded funds over traditional mutual funds is their relative transparency.
That means that when you invest in an ETF, you know exactly what
you’re buying. Traditional mutual funds are not required to reveal their
specific investments; you may think you’re buying one thing but you get
another.
When it comes to buying and selling individual bonds, it’s as if a muddy
pond has been transformed into a glass aquarium. Not long ago, a bond
broker would give you a price for a bond, and you’d have absolutely no
idea how fair a deal you were getting. Nowadays, you can search online
and usually get a very good idea of how fair a deal you’re getting, how
much the broker is making, and whether there are better deals to be
had. I give you a complete tour of the aquarium in Chapter 15.
 The expansion of Uncle Sam’s treasury chest: If you are going to invest
in individual bonds, U.S. Treasury bonds may make the most sense. The
Treasury now has a Web site where you can buy its bonds directly and
not have to deal with any brokers whatsoever, nor fork over any kind of
markup. I walk you through www.treasurydirect.gov in Chapter 5.
45
Chapter 3: The (Often, but Not Always) Heroic History of Bonds

One special kind of Treasury bond — Treasury Inflation-Protected
Securities, or TIPS — has been in existence since the mid-1990s. It is a
very exciting development in the world of bonds. TIPS offer only very
modest interest rates, but the principal is readjusted annually to keep
up with inflation. TIPS represent an entirely new asset class (kind of
investment), and I advocate that most of my clients hold at least one-
third of their bond allocation in TIPS. They are wonderful portfolio diver-
sifiers and are among the safest of all investments. Read all about them
in Chapter 5.
 Internationalization of the bond market: The United States government
isn’t the only government to issue bonds. U.S. corporations aren’t the
only corporations to issue bonds, either. For added portfolio diversifica-
tion, and possibly a higher yield, you may want to look abroad. Until
recently, international diversification in fixed income was very difficult.
Now, it’s as easy as (but not as American as) apple pie. As with U.S.
bonds, you have your pick of short-term or long-term bonds, safe-and-
simple or risky-with-high-return potential. You can invest in the calm
waters of England, Germany, and France, or travel to countries such as
Thailand and Brazil where the bond markets are choppy and exciting.
Join me on the voyage abroad in Chapter 9.

I
n the city of Uruk, in the month of Ululu, on the 11th day of the 9th year of
Nebuchadnezzar (that would be 595 B.C.), a man named Nabu-usabsi lent a
half mina (about half a pound) of silver to Nabu-sar-ashesu. They signed an
agreement witnessed by a holy priest and four countrymen. The agreement
stated that within one year, Nabu-sar-ashesu would return to Nabu-usabsi his
half mina of silver plus another ten shekels, each shekel equal to about 1⁄60 of a
pound of silver. If you do the math, that equates to a yearly rate of interest of
162⁄3 percent.
That story from an ancient Babylonian text was retold, nearly 2,600 years
later, in A History of Interest Rates, a 700-page textbook by Sidney Homer and
Richard Sylla, first published in 1963. (A fourth edition was published by
Wiley in 2005.) The book is an amazing collection of research into credit and
interest rates going back not only to the 9th year of Nebuchadnezzar, but
even offering some speculation that interest payments of one sort or another
existed in prehistoric times.
And why, pray tell, am I bringing this up in a book on bond investing in the
computer age? Because most of today’s credit is tied up in bonds, and the
most salient feature of any bond is the interest rate paid. Interestingly
(pardon the pun), many of the same forces that drove interest rates 2,600
years ago are still driving interest rates today, as you find out in this chapter.

On the following pages, I examine what forces affect interest rates and the
demand for credit. I introduce the many (and often confusing, sometimes pur-
posely confusing) ways in which bond returns are measured and reported.
And I give you the tools you need to determine whether Mr. Nabu-usabsi was
getting a fair return on his investment, as well as what you, as a thoroughly
modern bond investor, should expect in return for your bond investments.
Calculating Rates of Return Can Be Like
Deciphering Ancient Babylonian
Bond investing can be tricky business indeed — way trickier than stock
investing. To help me explain why, I’m going to call upon our Babylonian
friends, Nabu-usabsi and Nabu-sar-ashesu. And I’m going to introduce two
new characters, Lila-Ir-lender and Kudur-Broker. The two Nabus are real char-
acters from a bygone era. Lila-Ir-lender (said to be a distant cousin of
Hammurabi) is fictional. Kudur-Broker is also fictional.
(Note to any Hollywood types reading this text: These are my characters; if
you decide to turn Bond Investing For Dummies into a blockbuster movie, I
demand a cut!)
Lila-Ir-lender, like Nabu-sar-ashesu, is a money lender. Kudur-Broker is, appro-
priately enough, a broker. Instead of dealing only in minas and shekels and
agreements written on parchment or stone, let’s now assume the existence of
bonds. With lenders, borrowers, and a broker, we now have a complete bond
market!
Figure 4-1 shows our four players in the fictional Babylonian bond market,
illustrated by Addie Wild, my 11-year-old daughter, and polished for publica-
tion by the Wiley graphics team.

Part I: Bond Appetit! 

Okay, are you ready now to see why this bond business can be so tricky?
Good. Let’s return to ancient Babylonia!
Cutting deals
Instead of merely signing an agreement, suppose that Nabu-usabsi, in return
for lending his half mina of silver to Nabu-sar-ashesu, gets a bond. Nabu-sar-
ashesu’s bond clearly states that Nabu-usabsi will get his investment back in
one year, plus 162⁄3 percent interest. In the parlance of the bond world, the
bond is issued with a face value of a half mina of silver, a coupon rate (or
interest rate) of 162⁄3 percent, and a maturity (or expiration date) of one year. 
I talk about these terms in more detail later.
For now, I want to impress upon you that measuring bond returns is not
always an easy matter. Why not? After all, the agreement calls for 162⁄3 percent
interest. Simple enough, eh? Not really.
Suppose that Nabu-usabsi wants to get his 162⁄3 percent interest not as a lump
sum at the end of the year but in two installments (as most bonds work): 81⁄3
percent after six months, and another 81⁄3 percent after another six months.
That is obviously a better deal for Nabu-usabsi because he gets the 81⁄3 per-
cent sooner and can, if he wishes, reinvest that money for another six
months. Let’s suppose that, in fact, he is able to reinvest that money for a
very high interest rate. By the end of the year, Nabu-usabsi will actually earn
more than 162⁄3 percent on his original investment. But how is his real rate of
return calculated?
Changing hands
To complicate matters further, suppose that Nabu-sar-ashesu, our bond
issuer, has agreed that his bond can be sold, and that he will continue to pay
162⁄3 percent interest to whomever buys the bond. In walks Lila-Ir-lender, who
wants to buy the bond from Nabu-usabsi but uses Kudur-Broker, the bond
broker, to make the deal. Kudur-Broker pays Nabu-usabsi one-half pound of
silver to obtain the bond. He turns around and sells it to Lila-Ir-lender for 6⁄10
pound of silver and pockets the difference for himself.
Lila-Ir-lender is now the proud owner of a bond that is paying 162⁄3 percent on
the original face value (one-half pound of silver). She, however, paid more for
the bond, thanks to the bond broker’s markup. So even though she is holding
a bond that is paying 162⁄3 percent, she isn’t really getting 162⁄3 percent on her
money; she’s getting less.
49
Chapter 4: Sweet Interest Is the Name of the Game

Now how much is the true rate of return on the bond? Is it 162⁄3 percent, or is
it 13.88 percent, which is the actual percentage return that Lila-Ir-lender
would be getting on the money she laid out?
Embracing the complications
You see why this bond business can be so confusing? (Yes, it would be just as
confusing if the names were “Mike” and “Sue” instead of Nabu-usabsi and
Nabu-sar-ashesu!)
I need to warn you in advance that this is the most technical chapter of this
book. You are about to read some things that confuse even many financial
professionals. I do my best to present the information as clearly as possible.
And I promise that I’ll even give you an intermission halfway through the
chapter so you can catch your breath! But you are probably right now won-
dering the following: Do you really have to know all this? Can you skim this
chapter, or should you really know how to calculate yield-to-maturity, yield-
to-call, and things like that? It depends.
If you are okay investing in bond mutual funds, especially the bond index
funds that I recommend later in this book (see Chapter 16), and you’re going
to buy and hold your investment, then a cursory knowledge of what makes
bonds tick will probably be just fine. (Knowing how they fit into your portfo-
lio, as outlined in Chapters 11 and 12, is probably more important.)
If you are intent, however, on dealing in individual bonds or trying to flip
bonds to make a profit (good luck!), you’d better either know this stuff or find
a bond broker you can really trust.
Understanding what follows will be easier than finding a bond broker you can
really trust. Trust me!
Conducting Three Levels of Research to
Measure the Desirability of a Bond
Determining the true value of a bond investment, and how much you’re really
going to get out of it in the end, requires three levels of research. I could com-
pare it to buying a home. Shopping for a home, here are the three levels of
research you conduct:
50
Part I: Bond Appetit! 

 Level one: You notice the curb appeal. You take note of the size of the
home and whether or not you find it attractive. You also, of course, note
the offering price.
 Level two: You look at the property taxes, the age of the plumbing, the
cost of utilities, and the condition of the roof.
 Level three: You expand your view to look critically at the surroundings.
How are the schools? Are area homes appreciating? Do the neighbors
park their pick-up trucks on the front lawn?
With a bond, you go through similar levels of research:
 Level one: You notice the curb appeal of the bond: What is the face
value, coupon rate, and sales price?
 Level two: You dig deeper into the qualities of the bond: What are its rat-
ings and maturity, and is it callable?
 Level three: You look at broader economic factors (the bond’s “neigh-
borhood”), which can greatly influence the value of your bond invest-
ment: the prevailing interest rates, inflation rate, state of the economy,
and forces of supply and demand in the fixed-income market.
I know that you may not be familiar with all the terms I’m using here — rat-
ings, callable, and so on. You soon will be! I introduce them all in this chapter.
Level one: Getting basic, easily 
available information
Here are the first things you want to know about a bond:
 What is its face value?
 What is the coupon rate?
 How much are you being asked to pay for the bond?
These can all be ascertained quite readily, either by looking at the bond offer
itself or by having a conversation with the broker.
Face value
Also known as par value or the principal, the face value is the amount the
bond was issued for. This is the amount that the bond issuer promises to pay
the bond buyer at maturity. The face value of the vast majority of bonds in
51
Chapter 4: Sweet Interest Is the Name of the Game

today’s market is $1,000. But note that a $1,000 par value bond doesn’t neces-
sarily have to sell for $1,000. After it is on the open market, it may sell for an
amount well above par or below par. If it sells above par, it is known as a pre-
mium bond. If it sells below par, it is known as a discount bond.
Know this: Discount bonds are discounted for a reason (generally because
the bond isn’t paying a very high rate of interest compared to other similar
bonds). Don’t think you are necessarily getting a bargain by paying less than
face value for a bond.
Coupon rate
The coupon rate is the interest rate the bond issuer (the debtor) has agreed
to pay the bondholder (the creditor), given as a percent of the face value. It 
is called the coupon rate because bonds in the old days had actual coupons
attached that you would rip off at regular intervals to redeem for cash. Bonds
no longer have paper coupons to rip off, but the term remains.
The coupon rate never changes. That’s the reason that bonds, like CDs, are
called fixed-income investments, even though, as you will see shortly, it is a
bit of a misnomer. A 5 percent bond will always pay 5 percent of the face
value (which would usually be $50 a year, typically paid as $25 every six
months). As I mention in the previous section, the bond doesn’t have to be
bought or sold at par. But whatever price a bond sells at doesn’t affect the
coupon rate.
Know this: The coupon rate, set in stone, tells you how much cash you’ll get
from your bond each year. Simply take the coupon rate and multiply it by the
face value of the bond. Divide that amount in half. That’s how much cash
you’ll typically receive twice a year. A $1,000 bond paying 8 percent will give
you $40 cash twice a year.
Sale price
In general, a bond will sell at a premium (above face value) when prevailing
interest rates have dropped since the time that bond was issued. If you think
about it, that makes sense. Say your bond is paying 6 percent, and interest
rates across the board have dropped to 4 percent. The bond in your hand,
which is paying considerably more than new bonds being issued, becomes a
valuable commodity. On the other hand, when general interest rates rise,
existing bonds tend to move to discount status (selling below face value).
Who wants them when new bonds are paying higher rates?
Don’t ask why, but bond people quote the price of a bond on a scale of 100. 
If a bond is selling at par (face value), it will be quoted as selling at 100. But
that doesn’t mean that you can buy the bond for $100. It means you can buy
it at par. On a $1,000 par bond, that means you can buy the bond for $1,000. If
52
Part I: Bond Appetit! 

the same bond is selling at 95, that means you’re looking at a discount bond,
selling for $950. And if that bond is selling for 105, it’s a premium bond; you’ll
need to fork over $1,050.
Know this: Most investors put too much weight on whether a bond is a dis-
count bond or a premium bond. Although it matters somewhat, especially
with regard to a bond’s volatility (see the final section of this chapter), it
doesn’t necessarily affect a bond’s total return. Total return refers to the sum
of your principal and income, plus any capital gains on your original invest-
ment, plus any income or capital gains on money you’ve earned on your origi-
nal investment and have been able to reinvest. Total return is, very simply,
the entire amount of money you end up with after a certain investment
period, minus what you began with. More on that later in this chapter.
Level two: Finding out intimate 
details of the bond
After you know the face value, coupon rate, and sale price (discount or pre-
mium), you are ready to start a little digging. Here’s what you want to know
next about the bond:
 Is the bond issuer capable of repaying you your money? Or is there a
chance that the issuer may go belly-up and default on (fail to repay) all
or part of your loan?
 When will you see your principal returned?
 Is there a chance that the bond will be called?
Ratings: Separating quality from junk
Not all bonds pay the same coupon rates. In fact, some bonds pay way more
than others. One of the major determinants of a bond’s coupon rate is the
financial standing of the issuer.
The United States Treasury, a major issuer of bonds, pays modest rates of
return on its bonds (generally a full percentage point less than similar bonds
issued by corporations). The reason? Uncle Sam doesn’t have to pay more.
People know that the United States government isn’t going to welsh on its
debts, so they are willing to lend the government money without demanding
a high return. Shakier entities, however, such as a new company, a city in
financial trouble, or the Russian government (which has a history of default-
ing) would have to offer higher rates of return in order to find any creditors.
So they must, and so they do.
53
Chapter 4: Sweet Interest Is the Name of the Game

An entire industry of bond-rating companies, such as Moody’s, Standard and
Poor’s (S&P), Fitch IBCA, and Duff & Phelps, exists to help bond investors
figure their odds of getting paid back from a company or municipality to
which they lend money. These firms dig into a bond issuer’s financial books
to see how solvent the entity is. The higher the rating, the safer your invest-
ment; the lower the rating, the more risk you take. Concurrently, there are
other places you can turn that will tell you how much extra interest you
should expect for taking on the added risk of lending to a shaky company.
Much more on the ratings in Chapter 6.
Know this: Ratings are very helpful — it is hard to imagine markets working
without them — but neither the ratings nor the raters are infallible. In the
case of Enron, the major ratings firms — S&P and Moody’s — had the com-
pany’s bonds rated as investment-grade until four days prior to the company
declaring bankruptcy! Investment-grade means that the risk of loss is very
low and the odds of getting repaid very high. Weren’t Enron bondholders 
surprised!
Insurance
Some bonds come insured and are advertised as such. This is especially
prominent in the municipal bond market, famous for its largely tax-free
bonds. Even though default rates are very low among municipalities, cities
know that people buy their bonds expecting safety. So they sometimes
insure. If a municipality goes to the trouble of having an insurance company
back its bonds, you know that you are getting a safer investment, but you
shouldn’t expect an especially high rate of interest. (No, you can’t decline the
insurance on an insured bond. It doesn’t work like auto-rental insurance.)
Know this: Some proponents of holding individual bonds say that you should
delve not only into the financial health of the bond issuer but also, in the
case of an insured bond, the financial health of the insurance company stand-
ing behind the issuer. That’s a fair amount of work, which is one reason I tend
to favor bond funds for most family portfolios.
Maturity
Generally, the longer the maturity of the bond, the higher the interest rate
paid. The reason is simple enough: Borrowers generally want your money for
longer periods of time and are willing to pay accordingly. Lenders generally
don’t want their money tied up for long periods and require extra incentive to
make such a commitment. And finally, the longer you invest your money in a
bond, the greater the risk you are taking.
Know this: I don’t care who the issuer is, when you buy a 20-year bond, you
are taking a risk. Anything can happen in 20 years. Who would have thought
20 years ago that General Motors might find itself on the verge of bankruptcy
(as it is as I’m typing these words)?
54
Part I: Bond Appetit! 

Callability
A bond that is callable is a bond that can be retired by the company or
municipality on a certain date prior to the bond’s maturity. Because bonds
tend to be retired when interest rates fall, you don’t want your bond to be
retired; you generally aren’t going to be able to replace it with anything
paying as much. Because of the added risk, callable bonds tend to carry
higher coupon rates to compensate bond buyers.
Know this: Please be careful when buying any individual callable bond. Much
of the real pain I’ve seen in the bond market has occurred over calls. I’ve
seen cases where a bond buyer will pay a broker a hefty sum to buy a bond
callable in, say, six months. The bond, sure enough, gets called, and the
bondholder suddenly realizes that he paid the broker a fat fee and made
nothing — perhaps got a negative return — on his investment. Of course, the
broker never bothered to point out this potentially ugly scenario. (Reading
this book, especially Chapter 15, will ensure that you never meet with a simi-
lar fate!)
Taxes
Back in the early days of the bond market in the United States, the federal
government made a deal with the cities and states: You don’t tax our bonds,
and we won’t tax yours. And, so far, all parties have kept their word. When
you invest in Treasury bonds, you pay no state or local tax on the interest.
And when you invest in municipal bonds, you pay no federal tax on the inter-
est. Accordingly, muni bonds pay a lower rate of interest than equivalent cor-
porate bonds. But you may still wind up ahead on an after-tax basis.
Know this: Whether or not the tax-free status of municipal bonds makes them
appropriate for your portfolio is the subject of Chapter 8. I’ll warn you in
advance that the simple taxable versus tax-free calculators you find online
will not always steer you in the best direction.
Okay, I promised earlier that I’d give you a break about halfway through this
chapter. Now’s the time: INTERMISSION! Feel free to step away, get a snack,
and come back when the glaze has cleared from your eyes.
All right . . . Ready to move onto that third level now? Remember, this chapter
is all about estimating the value of a bond investment. As I show next, getting
that estimate requires the use of a broad-angle lens.
Level three: Examining the neighborhood
Your home, no matter how well you maintain it or whether or not you reno-
vate the kitchen, will tend to rise or fall in value along with the value of all
55
Chapter 4: Sweet Interest Is the Name of the Game

other houses in your neighborhood. Many things outside of your control —
the quality of the schools, employment opportunities, crime rates, and earth-
quake tremors — can greatly influence the value of homes in your area,
including yours. Similarly, a bond, no matter its quality or maturity, will tend
to rise and fall in value with the general conditions of the markets and of the
economy.
Prevailing interest rates
Nothing affects the value of bonds (at least in the short to intermediate 
run) like prevailing interest rates. When interest rates go up, bond prices go
down — usually in lockstep. When interest rates fall, bond prices climb. The
relationship is straightforward and logical enough. If you are holding a bond
paying yesterday’s interest rate, and today’s interest rate is lower, then you
are holding something that is going to be in hot demand, and people will pay
you dearly for it. If you are holding a bond paying yesterday’s interest rate,
and today’s rate is higher, then you are holding mud.
Okay, that part is simple. Interest rates drive bond prices. But what drives
interest rates?
Interest rates come in many different flavors. At any point in time, there will
be prevailing interest rates for home mortgages, credit card payments, bank
loans, short-term bonds, and long-term bonds, but to a great extent they all
move up and down together. The forces that drive interest rates are numer-
ous, entwined, and largely unpredictable (even though many people claim
they can predict).
In the short run — from hour to hour, day to day — the Federal Reserve,
which controls monetary policy in the United States, has great power to
manipulate interest rates across the board. The Federal Reserve’s job is to
help smooth the economy by tinkering with interest rates to help curb infla-
tion and boost growth. Low interest rates make borrowing easy, both for
businesses and consumers. That helps to heat up the economy, but it can
also result in inflation. High interest rates discourage borrowing and so tend
to slow economic growth, but they also help to rein in inflation. So when
inflation is running too high, in the eyes of the Fed, it will move to raise inter-
est rates. And when the economy is growing too slowly, the Fed will tend to
lower interest rates. Obviously, it’s a balancing act, and perfect balance is
hard to achieve.
In the longer run — month to month, year to year — interest rates tend to
rise and fall with inflation and with the anticipated rate of future inflation.
Know this: Rising interest rates are, in the short run, a bondholder’s worst
enemy. The possibility that interest rates will rise — and bond prices will
therefore fall — is what makes long-term bonds somewhat risky. If you wish
to avoid the risk of price volatility, go with short-term bonds, but be willing to
accept less cash flow from your bond holdings.

The rate of inflation
The inflation rate signals the degree to which you have to cough up more
money to buy the same basket of goods; it indicates your loss of purchasing
power. In the long run, the inflation rate has great bearing on returns enjoyed
by bondholders. The ties between the inflation rate and the bond market are
numerous.
In economic theory, bondholders are rational beings with rational desires
and motivations. (In reality, individual investors often act irrationally, but as
a group, the markets seem to work rather rationally.) A rational buyer of
bonds demands a certain inflation-risk premium. That is, the higher the rate 
of inflation or the expected rate of inflation, the higher an interest rate bond-
holders demand. If inflation is running at 3 percent, bond buyers know that
they need returns of at least 3 percent just to break even. If the inflation rate
jumps to 6 percent, the inflation-risk premium doubles; bond buyers won’t
invest their money (or won’t invest it happily) unless they get double what
they were getting before.
Inflation is also a pretty good indicator of how hot the economy is. When
prices are rising, it usually reflects full employment and companies expand-
ing. When companies are expanding, they need capital. The need for capital
raises the demand for borrowing. An increased demand for borrowing raises
prevailing interest rates, which lowers the price of bonds.
57
Chapter 4: Sweet Interest Is the Name of the Game
How exactly does the Federal 
Reserve move interest rates?
The U.S. Federal Reserve has three “magic”
powers with which to expand or contract the
money supply, or move interest rates: open
market operations, the discount rate, and
reserve requirements:
 Open market operations: This term means
nothing more than the buying and selling of
Treasury and federal agency bonds. When
bonds are sold (and the public’s money is
funneled into government hands), the
money supply is tightened, inflation tends to
slow, and interest rates tend to rise. When
bonds are purchased back (and the public’s
money is returned), the economy is given a
boost, and interest rates tend to fall.
 The discount rate: This refers to the inter-
est rate that commercial banks must pay for
government loans. The more the banks
have to pay, the more they tend to charge
their customers, and interest rates tend to
rise.
 Reserve requirements: The reserve is the
amount of money that banks must hold on
hand as a percentage of their outstanding
loans. The higher the reserve requirements,
the tougher it is for banks to lend money,
and interest rates tend to rise as a result.

Know this: As a bondholder, you can get stung by inflation. Badly. That’s why
I recommend that a certain proportion of your bonds (around one-third) be
held in inflation-adjusted bonds, such as Treasury Inflation-Protected
Securities (TIPS). It’s also why a 100-percent bond portfolio rarely, if ever,
makes sense. Stocks and commodities have a much better track record at
keeping ahead of inflation.
Forces of supply and demand
The public is fickle, and that fickleness is perhaps nowhere better seen than
in the stock market. Although the bond market tends to be less affected by
the public’s whims, it does happen. At times, the public feels pessimistic, and
when the public feels pessimistic, it usually favors the stability of govern-
ment bonds. When the public is feeling optimistic, it tends to favor the higher
return potential of corporate bonds. When the public feels that taxes are
going to rise, it tends to favor tax-free municipal bonds. As in any other
market — shoes, automobiles, lettuce — high consumer demand can raise
prices, and low demand tends to lower prices.
Understanding (and Misunderstanding)
the Concept of Yield
Okay, time to hold onto your hat. Now that you know something about
researching the particulars of a bond offering, and the climate of the bond
market, it’s time to talk yield. Yield is what you want in a bond. Yield is
income. Yield contributes to return. Yield is confusion! People (and that
includes overly eager bond salespeople) often misuse the term or use it inap-
propriately to gain an advantage in the bond market.
Don’t be a yield sucker! Understand what kind of yield is being promised on a
bond or bond fund, and know what it really means.
Coupon yield
This one is easy. The coupon yield, or the coupon rate, is part of the bond
offering. A $1,000 bond with a coupon yield of 5 percent is going to pay $50 a
year. A $1,000 bond with a coupon yield of 7 percent is going to pay $70 a
year. Usually, the $50 or $70 or whatever will be paid out twice a year on an
individual bond.
Bond funds don’t really have coupon yields, although they have an average
coupon yield for all the bonds in the pool. That average tells you something,
for sure, but you need to remember that a bond fund may start the year and
58
Part I: Bond Appetit! 

end the year with a completely different set of bonds — and a completely dif-
ferent average coupon yield.
Current yield
Like coupon yield, current yield is easy to understand, at least on a superfi-
cial level. But there’s a deeper level. And because of that, it is the most often
misused kind of yield. In short, current yield is derived by taking the bond’s
coupon yield and dividing it by the bond’s price.
Suppose you had a $1,000 face value bond with a coupon rate of 5 percent,
which would equate to $50 a year in your pocket. If the bond sells today for
98 (in other words, it is selling at a discount for $980), the current yield is $50
divided by $980 = 5.10 percent. If that same bond rises in price to a premium
of 103 (selling for $1,030), the current yield is $50 divided by $1,030 = 4.85
percent.
The current yield is a sort of snapshot that gives you a very rough (and pos-
sibly entirely inaccurate) estimate of the return you can expect on that bond
over the coming months. If you take today’s current yield (translated into
nickels and dimes) and multiply that amount by 30, you’d think that would
give you a good estimate of how much income your bond will generate in the
next month, but that’s not the case. The current yield changes too quickly for
that kind of prediction to hold true. The equivalent would be taking a meas-
ure of today’s rainfall, multiplying it by 30, and using that number to estimate
rainfall for the month. (Well, the current yield would be a bit more accurate,
but you get my point.)
Yield-to-maturity
A much more accurate measure of return, although still far from perfect, is
the yield-to-maturity. It’s a considerably more complicated deal than figuring
out current yield. Yield-to-maturity factors in not only the coupon rate and
the price you paid for the bond, but also how far you have to go to get your
principal back, and how much that principal will be.
Yield-to-maturity calculations make a big assumption that may or may not
prove true: They assume that as you collect your interest payments every six
months, you reinvest them at the same interest rate you’re getting on the
bond. With this (often faulty) assumption in mind, here’s the formula for cal-
culating yield-to-maturity:
Um, I don’t know.
59
Chapter 4: Sweet Interest Is the Name of the Game

I can’t remember it. Like most other financial planners, I would have to look it
up. It’s a terribly long formula with all kinds of horrible Greek symbols and
lots of multiplication and division and I think there’s a muffler and an ice tray
thrown in. But (thank goodness) I don’t need to know the formula!
Thanks to the miracle of modern technology, I can punch a few numbers in
my financial calculator, or I can go to any number of online calculators. (Try
putting “yield-to-maturity calculator” in your favorite search engine.) I like
the calculator on MoneyChimp.com (a great financial Web site that features
all sorts of cool calculators).
After you find a yield-to-maturity calculator, you’ll be asked to put in the par
(face) value of the bond (almost always $1,000), the price you are considering
paying for the bond, the number of years to maturity, and the coupon rate.
Then you simply punch the “calculate” icon. If, for example, I were to pur-
chase a $1,000 par bond for $980, and that bond was paying 5 percent, and it
matured in ten years, the yield-to-maturity would be 5.262 percent.
A few paragraphs ago, I calculated the current yield for such a bond to be
5.10 percent. The yield-to-maturity on a discounted bond (a bond selling for
below par) will always be higher than the current yield. Why? Because when
you eventually get your principal back at maturity, you’ll be, in essence,
making a profit. You paid only $980, but you’ll see a check for $1,000. That
extra $20 adds to your yield-to-maturity. The reverse is true of bonds pur-
chased at a premium (a price higher than par value). In those cases, the
yield-to-maturity will be lower than the current yield.
Unscrupulous bond brokers have been known to tout current yield, and only
current yield, when selling especially premium-priced bonds. The current
yield may look great, but you’ll take a hit when the bond matures by collect-
ing less in principal than you paid for the bond. Your yield-to-maturity, which
matters more than current yield, may, in fact, stink.
Yield-to-call
If you buy a callable bond, the company or municipality that issues your bond
can ask for it back, at a specific price, long before the bond matures. Premium
bonds, because they carry higher-than-average coupon yields, are often
called. What that means is that your yield-to-maturity is pretty much a moot
point. What you’re likely to see in the way of yield is yield-to-call. It’s figured
out the same way that you figure out yield-to-maturity (use MoneyChimp.com
if you don’t have a financial calculator), but the end result — your actual
return — may be considerably lower.
60
Part I: Bond Appetit! 

Keep in mind that bonds are generally called when market interest rates have
fallen. In that case, not only is your yield on the bond you’re holding dimin-
ished, but your opportunity to invest your money in anything paying as high
an interest rate has passed. From a bondholder’s perspective, calls are not
pretty, which is why callable bonds must pay higher rates of interest to find
any buyers. (From the issuing company’s or municipality’s perspective,
callable bonds are just peachy; after the call, the company or municipality
can, if it wishes, issue a new bond that pays a lower interest rate.)
Certain hungry bond brokers may “forget” to mention yield-to-call and
instead quote you only current yield or yield-to-maturity numbers. In such
cases, you may pay the broker a big cut to get the bond, hold it for a short
period, and then have to render it to the bond issuer, actually earning your-
self a negative total return. Ouch.
Worst-case basis yield
Usually a callable bond will not have one possible call date, but several.
Worst-case basis yield (or yield-to-worst-call) looks at all possible yields and
tells you what your yield would be if the company or municipality decides to
call your bond at the worst possible time.
Callable bonds involve considerably more risk than noncallable bonds. If
interest rates drop, your bond will likely be called. Your yield on the existing
bond just dropped from what you expected, and you won’t be able to re-
invest your money for a like rate of return. If interest rates have risen, the
company probably won’t call your bond, but you are stuck with an asset, if
you should try to sell it, that has lost principal value. (Bond prices always
drop when interest rates rise.)
The 30-day SEC yield
Because there are so many ways of measuring yield, and because bond
mutual funds were once notorious for manipulating yield figures, the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires that all bond funds
report yield in the same manner. The 30-day SEC yield, which attempts to
consolidate the yield-to-maturity of all the bonds in the portfolio, exists so
the mutual-fund bond shopper can have some measure with which to com-
parison shop. It isn’t a perfect measure, in large part because the bonds in
your bond fund today may not be the same bonds in your bond fund three
weeks from now. Nonetheless, the 30-day SEC yield can be helpful in choosing
the right funds. (More on fund shopping in Chapter 16.)
61
Chapter 4: Sweet Interest Is the Name of the Game

Recognizing Total Return (This 
Is What Matters Most!)
Even though bonds are called fixed-income investments, and even though
bond returns are easier to predict than stock returns, ultimately you can’t
know the exact total return of any bond investment until after the investment
period has come and gone. That’s true for bond funds, and it’s also true for
most individual bonds (although many die-hard bond investors I’ve met
refuse to admit it). Total return is the entire pot of money you wind up with
after the investment period has come and gone. In the case of bonds or bond
funds, that involves not only your original principal and your interest, but
also any changes in the value of your original principal. Ignoring for the
moment the risk of default (and losing all your principal), here are other ways
in which your principal can shrink or grow.
Figuring in capital gains and losses
In the case of a bond fund, your principal is represented by a certain number
of shares in the fund multiplied by the share price of the fund. As bond prices
go up and down (usually in response to prevailing interest rates), so too will
the share price of the bond fund go up and down. As I discuss in a couple of
pages when I get to bond volatility, the share price of a bond fund may go up
and down quite a bit, especially if the bond fund is holding long-term bonds,
and doubly-especially if those long-term bonds are of questionable quality
(junk bonds).
In the case of individual bonds, your principal will come back to you whole —
but only if you hold the bond to maturity or if the bond is called. If, on the
other hand, you choose to sell the bond before maturity, you’ll wind up with
whatever market price you can get for the bond at that point. If the market
price has appreciated (the bond sells at a premium), you can count your
capital gains as part of your total return. If the market price has fallen (the
bond sells at a discount), the capital losses will offset any interest you’ve
made on the bond.
Factoring in reinvestment rates of return
Total return of a bond can come from three sources:
 Interest on the bond
 Any possible capital gains (or losses)
 Whatever rate of return you get, if you get any, when you reinvest the
money coming to you every six months
62
Part I: Bond Appetit! 

Believe it or not, on a very long-term bond, the last factor — your so-called
reinvestment rate — will probably be the most important of the three! That’s
because of the amazing power of compound interest.
The only kind of bond where the reinvestment rate is not a factor is a zero-
coupon bond, or a bond where your only interest payment comes at the very
end when the bond matures. In the case of zero-coupon bonds, there is no
compounding. The coupon rate of the bond is your actual rate of return, not
accounting for inflation or taxes.
Example: Suppose you buy a 30-year, $1,000 bond that pays 6 percent on a
semiannual basis. If you spend the $30 you collect twice a year, you’ll get
$1,000 back for your bond at the end of 30 years, and your total annual rate of
return (ignoring taxes and inflation) would have been 6 percent simple inter-
est. But now suppose that on each and every day that you collect those $30
checks, you immediately reinvest them at the same coupon rate. Over the
course of 30 years, that pile of reinvested money will grow at an annual rate
of 6 percent compounded.
In this scenario, at the end of six months, your investment will be worth $1,030.
At the end of one year, your investment will be worth $1,060.90. (The extra 90
cents represents a half year’s interest on the $30.) The following six months,
you’ll earn 6 percent on the new amount, and so on, for 30 more years. Instead
of winding up with $1,000 after 30 years, as you would if you spent the semi-
annual bond payments, you will instead wind up with $5,891.60 — almost six
times as much!
Allowing for inflation adjustments
Of course, that $5,891.60 due to 6 percent compound interest probably won’t
be worth $5,891.60 in 30 years. Your truest total rate of return will need to
account for inflation. If inflation — the rise in the general level of prices —
were 3 percent a year for the next 30 years (roughly what it has been in the
past decade), your $5,891.60 will be worth only $2,366.24 in today’s dollars —
a real compound return of 2.91 percent.
To account for inflation when determining the real rate of return on an invest-
ment, you can simply take the nominal rate of return (6 percent in our exam-
ple) and subtract the annual rate of inflation (3 percent in our example). That
will give you a very rough estimate of your total real return.
But if you want a more exact figure, here is the formula to use:
1 + nominal rate of return / 1 + inflation rate – 1 x 100 = Real rate of return
63
Chapter 4: Sweet Interest Is the Name of the Game

Assuming a 6 percent nominal rate of return and 3 percent inflation:
1.06 / 1.03 – 1 x 100 = 2.91
Why the more complicated calculation? You can’t just subtract 3 from 6
because inflation is eating away at both your principal and your gains
throughout the year.
Weighing pre-tax versus post-tax
Of course, we can’t finish up this discussion without mentioning taxes. Taxes
almost always eat into your bond returns. Here are two exceptions:
 Tax-free municipal bonds where there is neither a capital gain nor a capi-
tal loss, nor is the bondholder subject to any alternative minimum tax.
(More on taxes and munis in Chapter 8.)
 Bonds held in a tax-advantaged account, such as an IRA or a 529 college
savings plan.
For most bonds, the interest payments are taxed as regular income, and any
rise in the value of the principal, if the bond is sold (and sometimes even if
the bond is not sold), is taxed as capital gain.
For most people these days, long-term capital gains (more than one year) on
bond principal are taxed at 15 percent. Any appreciated fixed-income asset
bought and sold within a year is taxed at your normal income-tax rate, what-
ever that is. (Most middle-income Americans today are paying somewhere
around 30 percent in income tax.)
Measuring the Volatility 
of Your Bond Holdings
When investment pros talk of volatility, they are talking about risk. When they
talk about risk, they are talking about volatility. Volatility in an investment
means that what is worth $1,000 today may be worth $900 . . . or $800 . . .
tomorrow. Bonds are typically way less risky than stocks (that’s why we love
bonds so much), but bonds can fall in value. Some bonds are much more
volatile than others, and before you invest in any bond, you should have a
good idea what kind of volatility (risk) you are looking at.
64
Part I: Bond Appetit! 

Time frame matters most
The more time until the bond matures, the greater the bond’s volatility. In
other words, with long-term bonds, there’s a greater chance that the principal
value of the bond can rise or fall dramatically. Short-term bonds sway much
less. On the other hand — and here’s a somewhat funny contradiction — the
further off your need to tap into the bond’s principal, the less that volatility
should matter to you.
As I explain earlier in this chapter, nothing affects the value of your bond
holdings as much as prevailing interest rates. If you are holding a bond that
pays 5 percent, and prevailing interest rates are 6 percent, your bond isn’t
worth nearly as much as it would be if prevailing interest rates were 5 per-
cent (or, better yet, 4 percent). But just how sensitive is the price of a bond to
the ups and downs of interest rates? It depends, mostly on the maturity of
the bond.
Suppose you are holding a fresh 30-year bond with a coupon rate of 5 per-
cent, and suddenly prevailing interest rates move from 5 percent to 6 per-
cent. You are now looking at potentially 30 years of holding a bond that is
paying less than the prevailing interest rate. So how attractive does that bond
look to you, or anyone else? Answer: It looks like used oil dripping from the
bottom of an old car.
But suppose you are holding either a very short-term bond or an old 30-year
bond that matures next month. In either case, you will see your principal
very soon. Does it matter much that prevailing interest rates have risen? No,
not really. The price of your bond isn’t going to be much affected.
Quality counts
High quality, investment-grade bonds, issued by solid governments or corpo-
rations, tend to be less volatile than junk bonds. This has nothing to do with
interest rates but, rather, with the risk of default. When the economy is look-
ing shaky and investor optimism fades, few people want to be holding the
debt of entities that may fail. In times of recession and depression, high
quality bonds may rise in value and junk bonds may fall, as people clamor for
safety. Overall, the junk bonds will bounce in price much more than the
investment-grade bonds.
65
Chapter 4: Sweet Interest Is the Name of the Game

The coupon rate matters, too
Returning to the effect of interest rates on bond prices, not all bonds of like
maturity will have the same sensitivity to changes in prevailing rates. Aside
from the maturity, you also need to consider the coupon rate. Bonds with the
highest coupon rates on the market (bonds currently selling at a premium)
tend to have the least volatility. Can you guess why that might be?
Imagine that you are considering the purchase of two $1,000 bonds: One
matures in three years and is paying a 10 percent interest rate ($100 a year).
The other also matures in three years and is paying a 5 percent rate of inter-
est ($50 a year). Obviously, the market price of the 10 percent bond will be
much higher. (It will sell at a premium vis-à-vis the 5 percent bond.) It will
also be less sensitive to interest rates because you are, in effect, getting your
money back sooner.
With the 5 percent bond, your investment won’t pay off until the bond
matures and you get your $1,000 face value (probably much more than you
paid for the bond). And who knows where interest rates will be then? With the
10 percent bond, you get your investment paid back much sooner, and you are
free to reinvest that money. There is much less reinvestment risk — the risk
that you will be able to reinvest your money only at pitifully low rates.
The most volatile of bonds — those most sensitive to fluxes in interest rates —
are zero-coupon bonds that pay all their interest at maturity.
Fortunately, a mathematical whiz named Frederick Macaulay gave us a for-
mula back in the 1930s for calculating the sensitivity of a bond to prevailing
interest rates. The formula works regardless of whether the bond is a zero-
coupon bond or is paying regular coupons. The formula allows us to compare
and contrast various bonds of various kinds to estimate their future volatility.
The wickedly complex formula measures something called duration. Duration
tells you how much a bond will move in price if there is a 1 percent change in
interest rates.
Figuring out the duration of a bond is pretty much impossible without either a
Ph.D. in mathematics or a computer. If you don’t have the Ph.D., use the com-
puter (just search “bond duration calculator”), or ask the broker who wants 
to sell you the bond to do it for you. If you’re considering purchasing a bond
mutual fund, you’ll find the fund’s average duration (sometimes called average
effective duration) in the prospectus or other fund literature. You’ll also find it
on www.morningstar.com, your brokerage firm’s Web site, or any other
number of sources where bond funds are contrasted and compared.
66
Part I: Bond Appetit! 

The duration formula takes into account a bond’s or bonds’ par value,
coupon rate, yield-to-maturity, and the number of years until the bond or
bonds mature. It then spits out a single number. Here is what that number
means: The principal value of a bond or bond fund with a duration of, say, 6,
can be expected to change 6 percent with every 1 percent change in interest
rates. If prevailing interest rates go up 1 percent, the bond or bond fund
should drop in value 6 percent. If interest rates fall by 1 percent, the bond 
or bond fund should rise 6 percent.
Of course, if you’re holding an individual bond to maturity, or if you have no
intention of selling off your bond fund any time in the near future, such fluc-
tuations in price are less important than if you plan to collect your money
and run any time soon.
Returning to the Bonds of Babylonia
Before moving along to Part II, I’d like to return for a moment to the beginning
of this chapter and to ancient Babylonia. Here’s my question: Was Mr. Nabu-
usabsi’s 162⁄3 percent return a good or bad investment?
Part of the answer lies in the ability of Mr. Nabu-sar-ashesu (the guy who got
the silver) to repay the loan. History doesn’t tell us if he was a good credit
risk or if, in fact, the loan was ever repaid. The other part of the answer is
whether that interest rate was fair for the time. Was it in line with other simi-
lar loans? We don’t quite know that, either.
Interest short run, interest long run
What we do know is that lending money at a certain fixed interest rate (such
as you do when you buy a bond) is often a good idea if prevailing interest
rates are falling and a bad idea if interest rates are rising. At least that’s true
in the short run, such as a one-year period. Mr. Nabu-usabsi was probably
gleeful if interest rates fell throughout the 9th year of Nebuchadnezzar.
In the longer run, it isn’t clear that falling interest rates are a bond buyer’s
best friend. Buying bonds at a time of rising interest rates is not necessarily a
mistake. I explain in Part IV how to strategize your bond buys and sells to
make money in just about any kind of economy, any interest-rate environment.
67
Chapter 4: Sweet Interest Is the Name of the Game

Interest past, interest future
Historical records make it clear that interest rates have fluctuated all across
the board over the millennia. But lending your money (again, as you do when
you buy a bond), if done wisely, is a time-honored way of making your money
work for you. Throughout the rest of this book, I show you exactly how to do
that.
68
Part I: Bond Appetit! 
Interest rates as a barometer of society’s strength
The History of Interest Rates, the tome I refer-
ence at the start of this chapter, tracks the great
ups and downs of interest rates over the cen-
turies, from ancient Babylonia to medieval
Europe and from America’s colonial days to
today. The one conclusion that can be drawn,
say the authors, is that interest rates generally
show a progressive decline as each society
develops and thrives, and then they rise sharply
as each society declines and falls.
In Ancient Rome, for example, prevailing short-
term interest rates were above 8 percent until
about 250 B.C. They then fell and continued 
to fall until, at the height of the Roman Empire
(100 B.C.–100 A.D.), loans could be had for about
4 percent. As the empire fell apart over the
ensuing centuries, interest rates rose to over 12
percent by the fourth century. Similar patterns
can be seen in Ancient Greece and Babylonia,
and in most societies since.
The tie between interest rates and society’s for-
tunes is easily explicable. When the times are
uncertain, lenders demand more in compensa-
tion for tying up their money. After all, anything
could happen in the interim. When the barbar-
ians are knocking at the gate, you aren’t going
to buy any low-interest bonds in the hopes of a
comfortable retirement watching gladiator
games in the Coliseum.

n the next five chapters, you get a good picture of the
major categories of bonds, including Treasuries
(Chapter 5), corporate bonds (Chapter 6), agencies
(Chapter 7), and municipal bonds (Chapter 8). Should
none of the major categories suit you, I provide in Chapter
9 a thumbnail sketch of some of the more unusual, some-
times quirky kinds of bond offerings available, such as
church bonds and catastrophe bonds.
In each chapter, you discover the nuances that make each
bond category unique. I show you why certain kinds of
bonds pay higher rates of interest than others and, at the
same time, may carry more risk. You can start to zero in
on the kinds of bonds that make the most sense for you —
the kinds of bonds that will make your portfolio shine.

A
lthough not from a terribly religious family, I did have a bar mitzvah. As
Jewish boys have done for several millennia, I stood before the congre-
gation and recited from the teachings of the Torah, whereupon the rabbi
blessed me and told me that I had become a man.
Who was I to argue?
Soon following the rabbi’s pronouncement, I found myself in a large, Long
Island catering hall where I was smiled upon by the masses, told mazel tov!
(“way to go!” in Hebrew), and handed many crisp white envelopes. Much
later that memorable night, I went home, sat on my bed, and opened those
many envelopes. Out poured U.S. savings bond after U.S. savings bond.
I was rich!
Or so I thought.
Little did I know at the time that a freshly minted U.S. savings bond with $100
emblazoned all over it isn’t worth $100 at all. Adults like giving savings bonds
as gifts to young people, because, well, I guess they figure that young people
are gullible. Even smart 13-year-olds who read the Torah can get fooled. The
ancient teachings may help us to know right from wrong, but, alas, they say
nothing whatsoever about U.S. government debt securities.

There are some things, I suppose, that a young boy-turned-man just has to
figure out for himself. And I eventually figured out that all those savings
bonds strewn across my bed were worth only half as much as whatever
denominations were printed on them. (I’m not complaining, mind you. I’m
grateful for that money, but discovering that I had only half as much as I
thought came as a bit of a blow.) Over the years, I’ve learned a number of
other things about savings bonds and other Treasury debt securities, and in
this chapter, I share that knowledge.
Please join me. You don’t have to be Jewish.
Exploring the Many Ways of 
Investing with Uncle Sam
There are umpteen different kinds of debt securities issued by the U.S.
Treasury. Savings bonds, which can be purchased for small amounts and
come in certificate form (making for nice, if not slightly deceptive, bar mitz-
vah and birthday gifts), are but one kind. In fact, when investment people
speak of Treasuries, they usually are not talking about savings bonds but,
rather, about larger-denomination bonds known formerly as Treasury bills,
Treasury notes, and Treasury bonds that are issued only in electronic (some-
times called book-entry) form. (I explain the differences between bills, notes,
and bonds very shortly.)
All U.S. Treasury debt securities, whether a $50 savings bond or a $1,000
Treasury note, share four things in common:
 Every bond, an IOU of sorts from Uncle Sam, is backed by the “full faith
and credit” of the United States government and, therefore, is consid-
ered by most investors to be the safest bet around.
 Because it is assumed that any principal you invest is absolutely safe,
Treasury bonds, of whatever kind, tend to pay relatively modest rates 
of interest — lower than other comparable bonds, such as corporate
bonds, that may put your principal at some risk.
 True, the United States government is very unlikely to go bankrupt any-
time soon, but Treasury bonds are nonetheless still subject to other
risks inherent in the bond market. Prices on Treasury bonds, especially
those with long-term maturities, can swoop up and down like hungry
hawks in response to such things as prevailing interest rates and
investor confidence in the economy.
 All interest on U.S. government bonds is off-limits to state and local tax
authorities (just as the interest on most municipal bonds is off-limits to
the Internal Revenue Service). But you do pay federal tax.

Part II: Numerous and Varied Ways to Make Money in Bonds 

Beyond these four similarities, the differences among U.S. government debt
securities are many and, in some cases, like night and day. Only because I
started this chapter talking about savings bonds, I address those first.
Savings bonds for beginning investors
U.S. savings bonds make for popular gifts, in part because they are, unlike
other Treasury debt securities, available in pretty certificate form. You can
buy them from just about any bank or directly from the Treasury at www.
treasurydirect.gov. You don’t have to buy them in certificate form; from
the Web site, you can also buy an electronic savings bond, which is regis-
tered online (no paper involved).
Savings bonds are a natural for small investors because you can get started
with as little as $25. With that money, you can buy a bond that has $50 printed
on it but won’t actually be worth $50 for some time to come. (Any kid who had
a bar mitzvah could probably tell you that.) At the current interest rate that
savings bonds are paying (3.60 percent), you would have to wait 20 years until
the true value caught up with the face amount.
Aside from the (optional) certificates and the ability to invest a small amount,
a third thing that makes savings bonds unique among Treasury debt securi-
ties is that that are strictly non-marketable. When you buy a U.S. savings
bond, either direct from the government or from a bank, you either put your
own name and Social Security number on the bond or the name and Social
Security number of someone you’re gifting it to. You or that person are then
entitled to receive interest from that bond. The bond itself (just like an airline
ticket, or your daughter) cannot be sold to another buyer. This is in stark
contrast to Treasury bills and bonds that can, and often do, pass hands more
often than poker chips.
73
Chapter 5: “Risk-Free” Investing: U.S. Treasury Bonds
Electronic savings bonds’ small advantage
Savings bonds in certificate (paper) form can be
purchased for $25, $50, $75, $100, $200, $500,
$1,000, $5,000 and $10,000. If you go through
www.treasurydirect.gov, you also
have the option of buying your savings bonds —
both Series EE and Series I — in electronic
form. When you go that route, there’s no need
to pick a denomination. If you wish to invest,
say, $43.45, go for it. If you want to invest
$312.56, that’s fine too. Any amount over $25 but
under $60,000 (per individual, per year) will be
accepted. Electronic bonds otherwise are just
like their paper cousins: They pay the same rate
of interest over the same period of time.
Note that these “denomination-free” bonds are
available only through the Treasury Web site
and available only with savings bonds. The mar-
ketable Treasury securities (bills, notes, or
bonds) can also be purchased through the Web
site but are available only in increments of
$1,000.

Among savings bonds, there are various kinds. At present, the Treasury is
producing only two varieties: EE Series bonds and I bonds. Some others you
may have stored away in your dresser drawers may include E Series bonds
and HH bonds. Each has its own characteristics.
EE (Patriot) bonds
EEs and Patriot bonds are one and the same. The word Patriot was added to
some, but not all, EE bonds in 2001. According to the Treasury, “Patriot
Bonds offer Americans one more way to express their support for our
nation’s anti-terrorism efforts.”
Whatever you want to call them, however you wish to express your support,
EE bonds are the most traditional kind of savings bond. They’re the kind
most people think of when they think savings bonds — the kind I got on my
bar mitzvah (although they were called something different back then).
Series EE bonds carry a face value of twice what you purchase them for. They
are accrual bonds, which means that they accrue interest as the years roll on
even though you aren’t seeing any cash. You can pay taxes on that interest as
it accrues, but in most cases it makes more sense to defer paying the taxes
until you decide to redeem the bond. Uncle Sam allows you to do that.
Series EE bonds issued prior to May 2005 pay various rates of interest
depending on the date of the bond. Most of these rates of interest are based
on fairly complicated formulas and fluctuate over time. If you own a pre-May
2005 savings bond and you aren’t sure what kind of interest the bond is
paying, the best thing to do is to look it up on the Treasury Web site, www.
treasurydirect.gov. EEs issued in May 2005 or afterwards pay a fixed
interest rate. At the time I’m typing this paragraph, that rate is 3.60 percent. 
I don’t know what it will be when you are reading this, but I can guarantee
that it will be modest.
EE bonds are nonredeemable for the first year you own them, and if you hold
them fewer than five years, you surrender three months of interest. EEs are
available in eight different denominations, from $50 up to $10,000. Any indi-
vidual can buy up to $30,000 in EE savings bonds a year (or a face amount of
$60,000).
If you use your savings bonds to fund an education, the interest may be 
tax-free.
Russell’s recommendation: Historically, savings bonds have paid a rate of
interest that has barely kept up with inflation. Therefore, you do not want to
make them a major part of your investment scheme. If you already have sav-
ings bonds, you may want to consider swapping them for a higher yielding
investment. If you wish to keep them, consider opening an account at www.
treasurydirect.gov and turning your paper bonds into electronic securi-
ties. That way, you won’t need to worry about them getting lost or destroyed.

Part II: Numerous and Varied Ways to Make Money in Bonds 

I bonds
These babies are built to buttress inflation. Issued in the very same denomi-
nations as EE bonds, the I Series bonds offer a fixed rate of return plus an
adjustment for rising prices. Every May 1 and November 1, the Treasury
announces both the fixed rate for all new I bonds and the inflation-adjustment
for all new and existing I bonds. At the time I’m writing this, the fixed rate
is 1.4 percent, and the inflation adjustment is a twice annual 1.55 percent.
Adding them together, the I bonds are currently yielding 4.52 percent a year.
(Yeah, I know that 1.55 + 1.55 + 1.4 = 4.50 percent, but the added .02 percent is
due to interest on interest.)
After you buy an I bond, the fixed rate is yours for the life of the bond. The
inflation rate adjusts every six months. You collect all your interest only after
cashing in the bond. (That is called accrual interest.)
The rules and parameters for I bonds are pretty much the same as they are
for EEs: You have to hold them a year, and if you sell within five years, you
pay a penalty. There’s a limit to how many I bonds you can invest in —
$30,000 a year, per person. And in certain circumstances, the proceeds may
become tax-free if used for education expenses.
Russell’s recommendation: Because the rate of inflation can vary dramatically
from six-month period to six-month period, there are times when I bonds
make for fabulous short-term investments. In November 2005, for example,
after a spike in the price of oil after Hurricane Katrina, the official inflation
rate shot up, and I bonds were paying a very impressive 6.73 percent. At that
point, I was recommending that anyone who had cash to invest might want to
consider them very seriously. But by the following May, with inflation having
cooled, the yield on I bonds dropped rather precipitously to 2.43 percent.
They were no longer such a hot investment — you could have done much
better with a bank CD.
75
Chapter 5: “Risk-Free” Investing: U.S. Treasury Bonds
Savings bonds for education
The interest on savings bonds — both EE and I
bonds — may be tax-free if you use the pro-
ceeds to pay for higher education expenses.
The guidelines are fairly complex, and you’re
eligible only if your income falls below a certain
limit. Currently, for single taxpayers, the tax
exclusion begins to be reduced with a $65,600
modified adjusted gross income and is elimi-
nated for adjusted gross incomes of $80,600 and
above. For married taxpayers filing jointly, the
tax exclusion begins to be reduced with a
$98,400 modified adjusted gross income and is
eliminated at $128,400. If you’re uncertain
whether you qualify, speak to your tax adviser.

If you plan to hold I bonds as a long-term investment (longer than a year or
two), you should be more concerned with the fixed rate, which will be in
effect throughout the life of the bond, than the inflation adjustment, which
will vary. Remember that if you cash out before five years, you’ll pay a
penalty of three months’ interest. You can purchase I Bonds at your bank or
by visiting www.treasurydirect.gov.
The dinosaurs
Other kinds of savings bonds pre-date today’s EE and I bonds. Each series of
the past has its own peculiarities, but since you won’t be buying any of them,
there’s no need to get into detail. Suffice to say that some of the older bonds
are still paying interest, and others are not. (See the sidebars “Check your
savings bond stash for dead wood” and “Savings bonds don’t pay interest for-
ever!” for more info.) If you have any questions on the status of a savings
bond you have tucked away in the back of your sock drawer, you can simply
type the serial numbers into the Savings Bond Calculator at www.treasury
direct.gov, or jot down the serial number and write a letter to
Bureau of the Public Debt
P.O. Box 7012
Parkersburg, WV 26106-7012
The Bureau of the Public Debt needs a written and signed request from the
owner of the bond, at which point, it will tell you whether the bond is still
earning interest, when it will stop paying interest, and how much you could
redeem it for today.

Treasury bills, notes, and bonds 
for more serious investing
About 98 percent of the approximately $5 trillion in outstanding Treasury
debt is made up not of savings bonds but of marketable (tradable) securities
known as bills, notes, and bonds (see Figure 5-1). This “bills, notes, and
bonds” stuff can be a little confusing because technically they are all bonds.
They are all backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. They
are all issued electronically (you don’t get a fancy piece of paper as you do
with savings bonds). They can all be purchased either directly from the
Treasury or through a broker. They can all trade like hotcakes. The major dif-
ference among them is the time you need to wait to collect your principal:
 Treasury bills have maturities of a year or less.
 Treasury notes are issued with maturities from two to ten years.
 Treasury bonds are long-term investments that have maturities of 10 to
30 years from their issue date.

The bills, like savings bonds, are sold at a discount from their face value. You
get the full amount when the bill matures. The notes and bonds, on the other
hand, are sold at their face value, have a fixed interest rate, and kick off inter-
est payments once every six months. The minimum denomination for all
three is $1,000, and you can buy them all in any increment of $1,000.
Russell’s suggestion: The main difference among various Treasury offerings is
the maturity. Generally, but not always, the longer the term, the higher the
rate of interest. Therefore, the longer you can tie your money up, the greater
your investment profits are likely to be. So one of the first questions you need
to ask yourself before investing in Treasuries (or most other bonds, for that
matter) is the following: When might I need to cash this baby out?
Keep in mind that you don’t have to hold any of these securities (bills, notes,
or bonds) till maturity. You can, in fact, cash out at any point. The longer
until the maturity of the bond, however, the more its price can fluctuate and,
therefore, the more you risk losing money. (It is because of this risk that I put
the quotation marks around “Risk-Free” in the heading of this chapter — just
in case you were wondering.)

Treasury Inflation-Protected 
Securities (TIPS)
Like the I bonds, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), introduced in
1997, receive both interest and a twice-yearly kick up of principal for inflation.
As with interest on other Treasury securities, interest on TIPS is free from
state and local income taxes. Federal income tax, however, must be coughed
up each year on both the interest payments and the growth in principal.
TIPS, unlike I bonds, are transferable. You can buy TIPS directly from the
Treasury or through a broker. (More detailed purchasing instructions are
coming later in this chapter.) They are currently being issued with terms of 
5 and 10 years, although there are plenty of 20-year term TIPS in circulation.
The minimum investment is $1,000.
79
Chapter 5: “Risk-Free” Investing: U.S. Treasury Bonds
U.S. Treasuries are the Mickey Mice of the 
international investment world
Never mind Mickey Mouse T-shirts and
McDonald’s hamburgers — the U.S. product
that foreigners are hottest for these days is the
U.S. Treasury bond. The percentage of all U.S.
government bonds held by non-U.S. citizens
increased from about 20 percent just a decade
ago to something over 50 percent today. Some
economists are very thankful for this foreign
investment because it arguably fills a desper-
ately needed role. The American people, both
strapped by their medical and college bills and
eager to live in homes the size of the Coliseum,
aren’t saving, and without saving, there can’t be
economic growth. But other pundits argue that
all that U.S. debt in foreign hands is creating a
potential debt bomb. They argue that the United
States is becoming terribly vulnerable, its econ-
omy resting in the hands of foreigners who
could at any moment turn evil (as foreigners
often do in movies) and crush us by suddenly
dumping all their Treasury bonds.
I’m not losing any sleep over this one. It’s not as
if all those bonds are in the hands of one rogue
nation led by a crazed colonel in fatigues. They
are in the hands of many nations that by and
large embrace capitalism, and besides, they
can’t stand each other. Heck, if the Germans
tried to dump U.S. Treasuries, the French would
buy those bonds up, just to spite the Germans. If
the Japanese were to start dumping, the
Koreans would buy them up, just to anger the
Japanese. And if the Canadians were to start
dumping, eh? Canadians are way too polite and
would never do such a thing. We should worry
more about other economic issues, such as
why those medical and college bills are so
astronomical, than we should the exportation of
our national debt.

One of the sweet things about TIPS is that if inflation goes on a rampage, your
principal moves north right along with it. If deflation, a lowering of prices,
occurs (which it hasn’t since the 1930s), you won’t get any inflation adjust-
ment, but you won’t get a deflation adjustment, either. You’ll get back at least
the face value of the bond.
TIPS sound great, and in many ways they are. But be aware that the coupon
rate on TIPS varies with market conditions and tends to be minimal — perhaps
a couple of percentage points. If inflation is calmer than expected moving into
the future, you will almost certainly do better with traditional Treasuries. If
inflation turns out to be higher than expected, your TIPS will be the stars of
your fixed-income portfolio.
Russell’s suggestion: Over the very long haul, I would fully expect the return on
TIPS to be roughly the same as that on other similar-maturity Treasuries. But
on a year-to-year basis, the two kinds of bonds will flip-flop. Flip-flopping —
another word for diversification — is a good thing! I generally recommend to
clients that about one-third of their bond portfolio be devoted to inflation-
protected securities. I would recommend more, but most portfolios also have
stocks (and some have commodities and real estate), and these have a good
track record of keeping up with inflation.
Setting the Standard by Which 
All Other Bonds Are Measured
Because the market assumes that the U.S. government is not going under in
our lifetimes (probably a fair assumption), there are no ratings on Treasury
bonds as there are with corporate bonds and municipal bonds. (I cover cor-
porates and munis in Chapters 6 and 8.) The markets for Treasuries are also
extremely efficient, meaning that there are so many buyers and sellers, and
any information worth having is way public, that any true “deal” will be very
hard to find. So the only real questions you need to ask yourself about
Treasuries are the following:
 Do I want Treasuries in my portfolio and, if so, how much?
 Do I want short-term, intermediate-term, or long-term Treasuries?
 Do I want inflation protection?
 How do I go about buying a Treasury?

Part II: Numerous and Varied Ways to Make Money in Bonds 

Turning to Treasuries in times of turmoil
When you buy Treasury bonds, you get the full faith and credit of the U.S.
government assuring you your money back. In addition, there’s no chance of
a costly downgrade, there’s no chance of an early call should interest rates
fall, and the liquidity is downright oceanic. These problems — downgrading,
callability, and lack of liquidity — are alien to investors in Treasuries but all
too common to investors in corporate bonds (see Chapter 6) and municipal
bonds (see Chapter 8).
Perhaps the most succulent thing about Treasuries, however, is their delight-
fully low correlation to the stock market. When the world is in turmoil and
the economy starts to quiver, stocks tend to tumble. But Treasuries — as
money pours in from investors looking for a safe place to hide — start to
shine. History has seen this over and over.
According to data from Ibbotson Associates, a Morningstar company, during
the darkest economic days of September 1929 through June 1932, long-term
Treasuries showed a total annualized return of 4.84 percent. Not bad for a
time when the general price level was dropping. During the more recent bear
market of September 2000 through September 2002, Treasuries returned an
annual 12.81 percent, as people flocked to safety and prevailing interest rates
fell.
The downside to Treasuries: Modest returns over the long run. Since 1926,
the U.S. stock market has seen an average annual return of 10.4 percent.
Long-term government bonds have seen an average annual return of 5.5 per-
cent. These numbers are before inflation. After inflation, the numbers move
quite far apart: 7.1 percent annual return for the stock market and 2.4 percent
for Treasuries — a real-return advantage of almost 300 percent for stocks.
(Inflation eats away at your investment every day of the year, while interest is
paid semiannually, so the formula for figuring post-inflation returns is a bit
complicated. Trust me, the numbers above are correct.)
Russell’s suggestion: Yes, you want Treasuries in your portfolio. Given their
modest returns, you don’t want overkill, however. Some Treasuries, some
higher-yielding corporate or other bonds, some stock, some commodities,
and maybe some real estate make the most sense for most people. As for the
fixed-income side of your portfolio, depending on your risk profile, you may
want to put somewhere between one-third and two-thirds of your bond allo-
cation into Treasuries (see Chapter 13).
81
Chapter 5: “Risk-Free” Investing: U.S. Treasury Bonds

Picking your own maturity
Just like the question of bonds versus stocks, and government bonds versus
corporate bonds, the question of maturity is largely a question of how much
risk you care to stomach. In general, the more years till a bond’s maturity, the
more volatile the price swings.
Not only are price swings an issue when buying a long-term bond (granted,
less of an issue if you plan to hold the bond till maturity), but long-term
bonds carry a much greater reinvestment risk. In other words, if you’re hold-
ing a 20-year Treasury bond and the coupon rate is 6 percent, you have no
guarantee that you’ll be able to reinvest your twice-yearly interest payments
at 6 percent. If prevailing interest rates drop to 5 percent or 4 percent, you
stand to lose . . . a very considerable amount over the 20 years.
Of course, the longer the term of the bond, generally the higher the coupon
rate. So choosing a maturity can be a tricky decision. Many financial profes-
sionals suggest a compromise and going primarily with intermediate-term
Treasuries (seven- to ten-year maturities).
Russell’s suggestion: It’s hard to go wrong with an intermediate-term Treasury
note. On the other hand, if you’re investing for the long run, and especially
if you are investing in a bond fund where the interest is automatically
reinvested, getting the extra juice from longer-term Treasuries may be the
way to go. Short-term Treasuries, for the individual investor, generally make
sense only when the rate those bonds are paying is higher than that of money
market funds and bank CDs. Sometimes that will be the case, other times not.
Keep in mind that you will pay state and local tax on the interest from the
CDs and from most money market funds, but not on the interest from the
Treasuries.

Part II: Numerous and Varied Ways to Make Money in Bonds 
The yield curve and what it means
Every amateur weathercaster knows that black
clouds above mean a stormy day ahead. For
economists, an inverted yield curve serves as a
black cloud indicating stormy economic times
ahead.
An inverted yield curve simply means that 
short-term Treasuries are paying higher yields 
than long-term Treasuries. In normal times,
longer-term bonds pay higher interest rates
than short-term bonds. That’s because
investors demand higher returns for agreeing to
tie up their money for longer and to take the
inherent risks that doing so involves.
Why might things occasionally turn on their
head? The common belief is that inverted yield
curves result when bond buyers collectively get
nervous about the economic future. To alleviate
their anxiety, they commit their money to long-
term bonds. That way, they figure, when things
tank and interest rates drop (as they often do in

83
Chapter 5: “Risk-Free” Investing: U.S. Treasury Bonds
times of recession), their existing bonds will be
worth more.
Are bond buyers right? Can they foretell a
recession coming? Historically, the answer is
sometimes yes and sometimes no. While an
inverted yield curve has preceded a number of
recessions, there have also been times, such as
in 1995 and again in 1998, when yield-curve
inversions were followed by a decidedly robust
year. Like all other economic indicators, the
bond yield curve, although better than tea
leaves at predicting the future, is far, far from
perfect.
Here is what a normal bond yield curve looks
like and what an inverted one looks like. Note
that what you’re looking at, unlike a stock chart,
does not show price movements over time.
Rather, it shows the current interest being paid
on short-term bonds versus long-term bonds.

Deciding whether you want 
inflation protection or not
As I’m writing this chapter, the current yield on a traditional ten-year
Treasury is 4.70 percent. The yield on ten-year TIPS is 2.4 percent. I look at
each. I compare. Inflation has been running at about 3 a year lately. I reckon
the Feds will therefore adjust my TIPS by 3 percent a year. I add that 3 per-
cent to the 2.4 percent, and I come up with 5.4 percent for the TIPS versus 
4.7 percent for the traditional. If my calculations are correct and the TIPS do,
in fact, adjust upward 3 percent, I wind up ahead.
My hunch is that most bond buyers and maybe the people at the Treasury
are figuring on a lower inflation rate moving forward. If it winds up as 2 per-
cent a year over the next ten years, I’ll see only a 4.4 percent return on my
TIPS, and I’ll kick myself for not loading up on traditional Treasuries. But if
inflation shoot ups, I’ll be in the catbird seat.
Who the heck knows.
Russell’s suggestion: Unless you can tell the future and predict interest rates
and inflation (um, you can’t), you want both traditional bonds and inflation-
protected bonds in your portfolio.
Entering the Treasury Marketplace
Buying a Treasury bill, note, bond, or inflation-protected security is a heck 
of a lot easier than buying most other bonds. With Treasuries, you needn’t
worry about such things as credit rating, callability, liquidity, and getting
socked with high broker markups. (I talk about all these delightful aspects 
of bond-buying in the next several chapters.)
Uncle Sam’s bonds can be purchased directly from, and sold to, the old man
himself. Or not. It’s your call.
Buying direct or through a broker?
Buying directly from, or selling to, the federal government is simply a matter
of logging onto www.treasurydirect.gov. Or, if you prefer to do it the old
fashioned way, by phone and mail, your can contact Legacy Treasury Direct
at 1-800-722-2678. (For savings bonds, call 1-800-245-2804.) Buying and selling
direct is certainly the most economical way to go. In fact, there is no charge
for any transactions. You can keep all your Treasuries with Treasury Direct,
and there is no fee. If you go with Legacy Treasury Direct, there is no fee until
your account tops $100,000, at which point, you have to pay $25 a year.
84
Part II: Numerous and Varied Ways to Make Money in Bonds 

The only reason to go through a broker, really, would be if you have a com-
pulsion to house all your assets under one roof. Most brokers charge a mini-
mal amount for dealing in Treasuries. Fidelity, for example, charges $1 per
bond if done by phone; 50 cents if done online.
The market for Treasuries is extremely efficient, which means that there are
so many buyers and sellers and bonds that the chance of finding a “deal” (as
you may — or may not — in the corporate bond market) is rather remote.
What you pay for a ten-year Treasury is pretty much what the next guy is
going to pay. Your yield is pretty much what the next guy is going to get.
Before you deal with any bond broker, whether for Treasuries or any other
bond, please read Chapter 15. For Treasuries, I’d rather see you buy direct.
Appreciating the difference between 
new and used bonds
Does it make much difference whether you buy new (on-the-run) or old (off-
the-run) Treasuries? In other words, if you want to make a 10-year investment
in Treasuries, does it matter whether you buy a new 10-year note or an old
20-year bond that has 10 years till maturity? No, not much. The yields should
be very, very similar. The only difference, really, is that when buying the old
bond, you’ll have to go through a broker, and the broker will likely charge you
a nominal fee.

Chapter 5: “Risk-Free” Investing: U.S. Treasury Bonds
Treasury strips
One kind of Treasury issue is available only
through brokers, and that is called a strip. A
Treasury strip is something of a strange duck. It
is, in essence, a single interest payment of a
bond that has been “stripped” from the rest of
the bond.
For example, a $1,000, 20-year Treasury bond
paying 5 percent offers 40 semiannual pay-
ments of $40 and one final principal payment of
$1,000. If you want to invest in such a bond but
have no need for immediate income, you may
purchase a strip, which would offer you, say,
only the final interest payment and the principal.
Strips are sold, like Treasury bills, at a deep dis-
count. You collect no interest for the time you
hold the strip and collect your cash only when
you redeem it. You may, for example, pay $400
for a strip that will pay you back $1,000 in 20
years. That would represent an annual interest
rate of 4.688 percent.
Debt securities that work this way are called
zero-coupon securities. Zero-coupons can be
very volatile. If you need to cash out early, you
may not get nearly what you bargained for. They
are also not very tax friendly. You’re taxed on the
interest as if you are paid annually, even though
you get no cash. You may want to consider a
strip only for your retirement account.

Tapping Treasuries through mutual 
funds and exchange-traded funds
According to Morningstar, U.S. investors have 660 federal government bond
mutual funds and exchange-traded funds from which to choose. You could
also buy your government bonds packed in something called a unit invest-
ment trust. Whichever of these three options you choose, you could, in a
flash, own a bevy of Treasuries, either with similar or different maturities. 
If you choose your fund well, your instant diversification will come at very
little cost.
Diversification of Treasury bonds isn’t as important as it is with, say, corpo-
rate high-yield bonds, but still . . . for the minimal cost of some bond funds
(as little as 15 basis points or 15/100 percent a year in operating expenses),
they make a darned good option for most investors. I share my pick of
favorite Treasury funds in Chapter 16.

Part II: Numerous and Varied Ways to Make Money in Bonds 
No repose for investors in repos
Repos, short for repurchase agreements, are
contracts for the sale and future repurchase of
a financial asset, most usually Treasury securi-
ties. The repo market is huge and complex, and
most of the players are professional investment
types. For the average person with a mortgage
to pay and mouths to feed, plunking money into
repos is potentially dangerous business. But if
risk is your middle name, you can enter the repo
market through most large brokerage houses.
In essence, you buy a barrelful of Treasuries for
little money. That’s known as leveraging. If
you’re familiar with buying stocks on margin, it’s
somewhat similar to that. But instead of bank-
ing on a company stock’s rise or fall, you’ll be
banking on a rise or fall in interest rates, which,
in turn affects the price of Treasuries. If interest
rates fall and bond prices go up, you can make
out like a bandit. If you’re wrong, however, you
pay the piper. The broker will be lending you
money to finance this speculation; make sure
you ask for the repo rate of interest, which is
generally less than the interest on other kinds
of borrowing (as it should be, because the
broker has your leveraged bonds as collateral).

O
h sure, the strength of our economy and the vigor of our industry rely
much on the progress of science, the foundations of democracy, and the
labors of a motivated and educated workforce. I don’t mean to belittle any of
that, but what really moves our economy and bolsters our industry, the
single most driving force in capitalism, without which we’d all be living in
huts and eating cold gruel, is OPM: Other People’s Money.
New businesses start every day, with the initial funding typically coming from
the savings of an intrepid entrepreneur or the good graces of a supportive
mom and dad. But to move a seedling of a business from the garage (where
Bill Gates started) to the storefront on Main Street to the malls or industrial
parks of America requires OPM. And OPM comes to a business mainly from
two sources: selling shares of the business to stockholders, or borrowing
money from bondholders.
In this chapter, I ask you to consider becoming a corporate bondholder. By so
doing, you can help drive our economy and our society to new heights and
spare the masses from having to eat gruel. Well, maybe. That’s perhaps an
overstatement. And possibly, it’s beside the point. Let’s forget about society
and gruel for the moment and just talk about what corporate bonds can do
for your personal wealth, shall we?

Why Invest in These Sometimes 
Pains-in-the-Butt?
To put it bluntly, corporate bonds can be something of a pain in the pants,
especially when compared to Treasury bonds (see Chapter 5). Here’s what
you need to worry about when investing in corporate bonds:
 The solidity of the company issuing the bond: If the company goes
down, you may lose some or all of your money. Even if the company
doesn’t go down but merely limps, you can lose some or all of your
money.
 Callability: There’s a chance that the issuing company may call in your
bond and spit your money back in your face at some terribly inoppor-
tune moment (such as when prevailing interest rates have just taken a
tumble).
 Liquidity: Will someone be there to offer you a fair price if and when you
need to sell? Will selling the bond require paying some broker a big, fat
mark-up?
 Economic upheaval: In tough economic times, when many companies
are closing their doors (and the stocks in your portfolio are plummet-
ing), your bonds may decide to join in the unhappy nosedive, en masse.
There go your hopes for an easy, sleep-in-late retirement.
So why even mess with corporate bonds?
Ah . . . that is a question that some of the world’s most prominent investment
experts have also asked, and they don’t all come up with the same answer.
Some argue that corporate bonds are indeed worth all the hassle and doubt
because the higher rates of interest they pay make them preferable to
Treasuries. Others argue that the difference in interest rates between corpo-
rate bonds and Treasuries (known as the spread) isn’t worth the potential
trouble of holding corporates.
Comparing corporate bonds to Treasuries
You may ask yourself why I start a chapter on corporate bonds by comparing
them to Treasuries. There are, of course, other kinds of bonds. Municipals
(which I cover in Chapter 8) are often appropriate for people in higher
income brackets, but they are never a good choice for tax-advantaged
accounts such as IRAs and 401(k) plans, where the vast majority of
Americans have most of their savings. Agency bonds (Chapter 7) can some-
times substitute for Treasuries, but their inordinate complexities make them
88
Part II: Numerous and Varied Ways to Make Money in Bonds 

inappropriate for many individual investors. High-yield bonds, otherwise
known as junk bonds (which I discuss later in this chapter), don’t add much
stability to a portfolio. And international bonds (Chapter 9) are good for
added diversification but, because of currency flux, should probably play a
limited role in your investment strategies.
No, when it comes to adding stability to a portfolio — the number one reason
that bonds belong in your portfolio, if you ask me — Treasuries and
investment-grade (high quality) corporate bonds are your two best choices.
They may have saved your grandparents from destitution during the Great
Depression. They may have spared your 401(k) when most stocks hit the
skids in 2000–2002.
But which is preferable: government-issue bonds or bonds issued by the for-
profit sector of our economy?
Hearing it from the naysayers
Some people, including David Swensen, chief investment officer of Yale
University, see little virtue in corporate debt. Swenson argues in
Unconventional Success: A Fundamental Approach to Personal Investment 
(Free Press) that corporations have a primary duty to their shareholders to
make as much money as possible for the company — and that means the
financial officers have a duty to make sure that their bondholders never get 
a fair shake. He writes:
Many investors purchase corporate bonds, hoping to get something for
nothing by earning an incremental yield over that available from U.S.
Treasury bonds. . . . At the end of the day, excess returns prove illusory
as credit risk, illiquidity, and optionality work against the holder of corpo-
rate obligations, providing less than nothing to the corporate bond
investor.
“In general, I’d say that Swensen is right, and the modestly excess yield
you’re going to get in corporates is not worth it,” says Don Taylor, Ph.D., CFP,
associate professor of finance with The American College in Bryn Mawr,
Pennsylvania. (Many U.S. financial planners get their education at The
American College.) “With Treasuries, you’re getting the full faith and credit of
the U.S. government, and you’re buying an asset class that is not correlated
to the stock market,” he says. “You’re going to get better diversification —
and you’re especially going to get better protection in a worst-case market
scenario.”
But then there’s the other side of the argument.
89
Chapter 6: Industrial Returns: Corporate Bonds

Taking a cue from the other side
“Those people who make unequivocal statements about never buying corpo-
rate bonds because the excess return over Treasuries is so paltry are gener-
ally not the same people who have to live on a limited fixed income,” says
Marilyn Cohen, president of Envision Capital Management, an investment
advisory firm in southern California specializing in fixed income. “The
experts are generally pretty well-heeled people, and it’s hard for them to
relate to the small investor, especially the retired small investor, who is
seeing his grocery prices go up every week and desperately needs a few extra
basis points just to pay the bills.” (One basis point equals 1/100 of a percent-
age point.)
Dan Fuss, vice chairman of Loomis, Sayles & Company, a highly regarded
bond mutual fund company, says there’s nothing wrong with Treasuries, for
sure, but despite the credit risk and the frequent callability features, corpo-
rate bonds often offer real economic opportunity — “especially for those will-
ing to do some work, and uncover value in the marketplace.” The veteran
fund manager isn’t just blowing smoke. His flagship Loomis Sayles Bond Fund
(LSBRX), which taps mostly intermediate- and long-term good quality corpo-
rate bonds, has a 15-year annualized return of roughly 11 percent. (I talk
more about Loomis Sayles and other bond funds in Chapter 16. In Chapter 21,
I feature a Q&A with Dan Fuss.)
So there you have it. What, you may wonder, do I expect you to do with this
contradictory advice?
Well, not to cop a line from old King Solomon or anything, but you could split
the baby and include both Treasuries and corporate bonds in your portfolio.
That’s what I do with my own money and for most of my clients. That way,
you can get the best of both worlds.
Considering historical returns
It’s hard to argue with Professor Don Taylor’s logic: During worst-case scenar-
ios, people do flock to safety. However, if we look at some of the worst eco-
nomic times in our nation’s history, corporate investment-grade (high quality)
bonds have held up remarkably well. According to data from Ibbotson
Associates, a Morningstar company, during the gloomiest economic days of
September 1929 through June 1932, long-term corporate bonds showed a total
annualized return of 2.99 a year, versus 4.84 for long-term Treasuries. During
the more recent bear market of September 2000 through September 2002, long-
term corporates surprisingly outperformed Treasuries, 15.08 percent versus
12.81 percent.

Part II: Numerous and Varied Ways to Make Money in Bonds 

Generally, corporate bonds tend to outperform Treasuries when the economy
is good and underperform when the economy lags.
Over the long run, corporate bonds outdistance Treasuries by a solid margin.
According to Lehman Brothers data, corporate investment-grade bonds of all
maturities and durations have collectively outperformed their counterpart
Treasury issues in 17 of the past 26 years, averaging about 90 basis points
(90/100 of one percent) more a year (see Figure 6-1).

Since 1980, the overall annualized real return on Treasuries, give or take a few
basis points, has been about 3 percent. The overall annualized return on cor-
porate investment-grade bonds has been roughly 4 percent. That’s a differ-
ence in return (if you’re looking up from down below, and talking ratios) of
one-third. A basket of corporate bonds invested over the past 26 years would
now be worth nearly15 percent more than a basket of Treasury bonds (see
Figure 6-2).
Most years, but not all, corporate bonds show greater returns than Treasury
bonds of similar maturity. Over time, the incremental difference grows, as
you can see in the squiggly line over the top of the bar chart.

Getting Moody: The Crucial 
Credit Ratings
Appropriately weighing potential risk and return is what good investing is all
about, really. As for the risk and return on corporate bonds, the potential
return (always something of a guessing game) is quoted in terms of yield, and
there are many kinds of yield. If you haven’t yet read Chapter 4, now may be 
a good time to do so; I detail the various kinds of yield there. The most oft-
quoted kind of yield, used for example by The Wall Street Journal and most
other business papers, is the yield-to-maturity.
The spread between corporate bonds and government bonds is quoted in
most newspapers and financial Web sites in terms of basis points (1/100 of a
percentage) and given as a range. For example, on the day I’m writing this, the
range for corporate investment-grade bonds is 84–98. That means investment-
grade corporate bonds, as a whole, are offering a yield-to-maturity that is
between 84/100 and 98/100 of 1 percentage point higher than that of Treasury
bonds of similar maturity. So, for example, if a 20-year Treasury bond were
currently yielding 5 percent to maturity, you would expect 20-year corporate
bonds to be paying somewhere between 5.84 and 5.98 percent.
Is that extra .84 to .98 percent worth the added risk of owning a corporate
bond? That depends largely on your individual risk tolerance, something I
help you determine throughout this book, especially in Chapter 10.

Part II: Numerous and Varied Ways to Make Money in Bonds 

But just as risk–return tradeoff exists between corporate bonds and Treasuries,
there is also a big risk–return tradeoff among corporate bonds. The largest
determinant of the risk and return you take on a bond is the fiscal muscle of
the company behind the bond. That fiscal muscle is measured by a company’s
credit ratings.
Revisiting your ABCs
There’s an entire industry devoted to rating companies by their financial
strength. The most common ratings come from Moody’s and Standard &
Poor’s, but there are other rating services, such as Fitch Ratings, Dominion,
and A.M. Best. (See the nearby sidebar “Growing discomfort with the credit-
rating business.”)
Your broker, I assure you, subscribes to at least two of these services and will
be happy to share the ratings with you.
The highest ratings — Moody’s Aaa and Standard & Poor’s AAA — are the
safest of the safe among corporate bonds, and those ratings are given to few
corporations. If you lend money to one of these stellar companies, you should
expect in return a rate of interest only modestly higher than Treasuries. As
you progress from these five-star companies down the ladder, you can expect
higher rates of interest to compensate you for your added risk.
Table 6-1 shows how Moody’s, Standard and Poor’s, and Fitch define corpo-
rate bond credit quality ratings.

If you are going to invest in individual bonds, diversification through owning
multiple bonds becomes more important as you go lower on the quality
ladder. There’s a much greater risk of default down there, so you’d be awfully
foolish to have all your eggs in a basket rated Caa or CCC. (Default in bond-
talk means that you bid adieu to your principal.)
Keep in mind that one risk inherent to corporate bonds is that they may be
downgraded, even if they never default. Say a bond is rated A by Moody’s. If
Moody’s gets moody and later rates that bond a Baa, the market will respond
unfavorably. Chances are, in such a case, that the value of your bond will
drop. Of course, the opposite is true, as well. If you buy a Baa bond and it
suddenly becomes an A bond, you’ll be sitting pretty. If you wish to hold your
bond to maturity, such downgrades and upgrades are not going to much
matter. But should you decide to sell your bond, they can matter very much.
It’s a very good idea to diversify your bonds not only by company but also by
industry. If there is a major upheaval in, say, the utility industry, the rate of
both downgrades and defaults is sure to rise. In such a case, you would be
better off not having all utility bonds.
Gauging the risk of default
How often do defaults occur?
According to a study by the folks at Moody’s covering the years 1970 to 2005,
the odds of a corporate bond rated Aaa defaulting were rather miniscule: 0.36
percent within 10 years and 0.64 percent within 20 years. Of all corporate
bonds, only about 2 percent are given that gloriously high rating.
94
Part II: Numerous and Varied Ways to Make Money in Bonds 

As you move down the ladder, as you would expect, the default numbers
jump. Bonds rated A can be expected to default at a rate of 0.87 percent over
10 years and 1.55 percent over 20 years. Among Baa bonds, 11.40 percent can
be expected to go belly up within a decade, and 13.84 percent within two
decades.
By the time you get down to Caa bonds, the rate of default is generally
expected to be about 40 times that of Aaa bonds — approximately 14 percent
within one decade and 26 percent within two decades. (Of course, these rates
can vary greatly with economic conditions.)
Special Considerations for Investing 
in Corporate Debt
Just as maturity is a major consideration when choosing a Treasury (see
Chapter 5), it should also be tops on your shopping list when picking a cor-
porate bond. In general (but certainly not always), the longer the bond’s
maturity, the higher its interest rate will be because your money will poten-
tially be tied up longer. And the longer the maturity, the greater the volatility
of the price of the bond should you wish to cash out at any point.
95
Chapter 6: Industrial Returns: Corporate Bonds
Growing discomfort with the 
credit-rating business
Two of the bond-rating service companies,
Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s, together con-
trol some 80 percent of the reportedly very
lucrative credit-rating market. The U.S. govern-
ment was willing to look the other way until both
companies failed to notice some rather serious
problems at both Enron and WorldCom shortly
before they went bankrupt.
After years of investigation, a law was signed in
September 2006 called The Credit Agency
Reform Act. The act gave birth to a designation
— NRSRO (Nationally Recognized Statistical
Rating Organization) — that the government
now awards to rating-service companies. The
new designation, currently held by both
Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s and a handful
of others, gives the Securities and Exchange
Commission some oversight over these compa-
nies. Industry insiders seem to agree that the
oversight, while a good thing in theory, hasn’t
quite shaken the industry yet. Most industry
insiders also seem to agree that the major bond-
rating services generally do a good job and that
the Enron and WorldCom disasters were rare
occurrences. Of course, if you were one of
those people who lost a bundle . . .

One consideration that pertains to corporate bonds but not to Treasuries is
the nasty issue of callability. Treasuries aren’t called. (Once upon a time they
were, but no longer.) Corporate bonds (as well as municipal bonds and
agency bonds) often are. And that can make a huge difference in the prof-
itability of your investment.
Calculating callability
Few things in life are as frustrating as a computer crashing. It seems to catch
all of us at the least opportune moment, such as right smack in the middle of
a huge work project. If you own a callable bond, chances are that it will be
called at the worst moment — just as interest rates are falling and the value
of your bond is on the rise. At that moment, the company that issued the
bond, if it has the right to issue a call, no doubt will. And why not? Interest
rates have fallen. The firm can pay you off and find someone else to borrow
money from at a lower rate.
Because calls aren’t fun, callable bonds must pay higher rates of interest.
If you’re inclined to go for that extra juice that comes with a callable bond, I
say fine. But, you should always do so with the assumption that your callable
bond will be called. With that in mind, ask the broker to tell you how much
(after taking his markup into consideration) your yield will be between today
and the call date. Consider that a worst-case-yield. (It is often referred to as
yield-to-worst-call, sometimes abbreviated YTW.) Consider it the yield you’ll
get. And compare that to the yield you’ll be getting on other comparable
bonds. If you choose the callable bond and it winds up not being called, hey,
that’s gravy.
I speak more of comparing yields in Chapter 15 where I discuss the mechan-
ics of buying and selling individual bonds. For now, I’ll just say that some
squirrelly bond brokers, to encourage you to place your order to buy, will
assure you that a certain callable bond is unlikely to be called. They may be
right in some cases, but you should never bank on such promises.
Coveting convertibility
The flip side of a callable bond is a convertible bond. Some corporate bond
issuers sell bonds that can be converted into a fixed number of shares of
common stock. With a convertible bond, a lender (bondholder) can become
a part owner (stockholder) of the company by converting the bond into com-
pany stock. Having this option is a desirable thing (options are always desir-
able, no?), and so convertible bonds generally pay lower interest rates than
do similar bonds that are not convertible.
96
Part II: Numerous and Varied Ways to Make Money in Bonds 

If the stock performs poorly, then there is no conversion. You are stuck with
your bond’s lower return (lower than what a nonconvertible corporate bond
would get). If the stock performs well, there is a conversion. So you win, so to
speak.
Know this: Convertible bonds, which are fairly common among corporate
bonds, introduce a certain measure of unpredictability into a portfolio. As I
explain in Chapter 12, perhaps the most important investment decision you
can make is how to divide your portfolio between stocks and bonds. With
convertibles, whatever careful allotment you come up with can be changed
overnight. Your bonds suddenly become stocks. You are rewarded for making
a good investment. But just as soon as you receive that reward, your portfo-
lio becomes riskier. It’s the old trade-off in action.
While I’m not saying that convertible bonds are horrible investments, I’m not
sure they deserve a very sizeable allotment in most individuals’ portfolios.
Reversing convertibility . . . imagine that
One relative newcomer to the world of corporate bonds is the reverse con-
vertible security, sometimes referred to as a revertible or a revertible note. I’ve
gotten a lot of calls lately from hungry and pushy salespeople trying to get
me to buy one, but I’m really not too thrilled with this product.
A reverse convertible converts to a stock automatically if a certain company
stock tumbles below a certain point by a certain date. Why would anyone
want such a thing? You guessed it: The bond pays a thrillingly high interest
rate (perhaps 2 or 3 percentage points above and beyond even the high rates
paid on junk bonds), but only for a year or so. That’s the hook. The catch is
that the company paying the high interest rate is often in dire trouble. If it
goes under, you could lose a bundle. Is that really the kind of risk you want to
take with a fixed-income investment?
Appreciating High-Yield for What It Is
There is no fine line between investment-grade and high-yield bonds, some-
times known as junk bonds. But generally, if a bond receives a rating less
than a Baa from Moody’s or a BBB from Standard & Poor’s, the market con-
siders it high-yield.
High-yield bonds offer greater excitement for the masses. The old adage that
risk equals return is clear as day in the world of bonds. High-yield bonds offer
greater yield than investment-grade bonds, and they are more volatile. But
97
Chapter 6: Industrial Returns: Corporate Bonds

they are also one other thing: much more correlated to the stock market. In
fact, Treasuries and investment-grade corporate bonds aren’t correlated to
the stock market at all. So if bonds are going to serve as ballast for our port-
folios, which is what they do best, why would anyone want high-yield bonds?
Um . . . I’m not entirely sure. I think that many people misunderstand them,
and if they understood them better, they probably wouldn’t invest.
Anticipating good times ahead
If the economy is strong, then companies are making money, the public is
optimistic, and stocks are going to sail. So may high-yield bonds, but stocks
historically return much more than high-yield bonds.
In general, a basket of high-yield bonds may return a percentage point or two
or three more than high quality bonds, but very rarely more than that. Stocks
have a century-old track record of returning about five percentage points
more than high quality bonds. And, unless you have those bonds in a retire-
ment account, you’re going to pay income tax on the interest. Most of the
gain in your stocks, however, won’t be taxed at all until you sell the stock.
Even then, it will most likely be taxed as capital gains — 15 percent — which
is probably lower than your income tax.
If there are good times coming, stocks are very likely going to do better than
any kind of fixed income.
Preparing for the bad times
If the economy starts to sour and companies start closing their doors, then
stocks will fall and high-yield bonds very likely will too. In 2000, for example,
when the stock market started to crumble, a basket of high-yield bonds
would have lost between 3 and 4 percent. That’s not a tragedy, but the last
thing you want is for your bonds to turn south right along with your stocks.
Investing in high-yields judiciously
You can see that I’m not a big fan of high-yield bonds. For most people, I don’t
suggest a very large allocation, if any at all.

Part II: Numerous and Varied Ways to Make Money in Bonds 

For people who really want junk bonds in their portfolios, I often suggest a
serious look at foreign high-yield bonds, especially the bonds of emerging-
market nations, which can make a lot of sense. That’s because they don’t
have much, if any, correlation to the ups and downs on Wall Street. I discuss
emerging-market bonds in Chapter 9.
In some cases, I may add domestic high-yield bonds to a portfolio as a means
of reducing risk. But rather than substituting high-yield bonds for investment-
grade bonds, I substitute the high-yield bonds for stocks. Less potential
return. Less potential loss. High-yield bonds are a sort of hybrid equity/fixed
income. But I generally suggest this strategy only if you can place the high-
yields in a tax-advantaged account, such as an IRA.
Whenever you invest in riskier securities, the importance of diversification
becomes magnified. Investing in individual junk bonds, unless you’re very
wealthy and can spread the risk among many junk bonds, is not something 
I would ever recommend. There are some very good high-yield bond funds
available, and I would suggest you choose one of those. I list some of my
favorites in Chapter 16.
If you’re wealthy (or not-so-wealthy but you choose to ignore my advice and
invest in individual high-yields anyway), know that the broker markups can
sometimes kill you. I discuss how to buy individual corporate bonds and not
get killed in Chapter 15.

You’ve no doubt heard the story of the three blind, er, sight-impaired men
and the elephant . . . how the first man touches the tail and assumes the
elephant is like a snake; the second touches the tusk and assumes the ele-
phant is like a spear; and the third touches the side of the animal and assumes
the elephant is like a wall. Welcome to the touch-me, feel-me, open-to-wide-
interpretation world of agency bonds!
Don’t get me wrong. There are some good investments to be had here. All you
have to do is figure out the tusk from the tail.
Some agency bonds are, like Treasury bonds (see Chapter 5), backed by the
so-called full faith and credit of the United States government. You’re going to
get your principal back even if Congress has to do the unthinkable and tax
the rich.
Most agency bonds, however, are not backed by full faith and credit, but per-
haps half the faith and credit of the United States government. The language
used is that the federal government has assumed a “moral obligation” or “an
implied guarantee” to stand behind these bonds. We investment experts nod
when we hear this, try to look smart, and say that we know what that means.
Truth be told, we’re all a bit cloudy on the concept. No one I’ve ever met
seems to know what “an implied guarantee” really means.

I can tell you, however, that no one ever lost his principal investing in agency
bonds due to a default.
Some agency bonds are traditional in the sense that they pay a steady rate of
interest and usually, like most bonds, issue payments twice a year. Others are
more free-floating. And yet others are entirely different animals — not big ele-
phants with tusks and tails, but maybe odd ducks with oily wings. These odd
ducks are called mortgage-backed securities; they pay interest and principal,
usually monthly, with the amount potentially varying greatly from payment to
payment.
It would be impossible in one chapter, perhaps even in an entire book, to
cover all the ins and outs, whys and wherefores of agency bonds. I do my
best on the following pages to give you a good overview.
Slurping Up Your Alphabet Soup
Who or what issues agency bonds? Following are just some of the many agen-
cies that issue bonds:
 Federal Farm Credit Banks (FFCB)
 Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB)
 Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC)
 Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA)
 Financial Assistance Corporation (FAC)
 Financing Corporation (FICO)
 General Services Administration (GSA)
 Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA)
 Government Trust Certificates (GTC)
 Private Export Funding Corporation (PEFCO)
 Resolution Funding Corporation (REFCORP)
 Small Business Administration (SBA)
 Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA)
 U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)
Don’t get lost in this alphabetical muck!
The first thing to know about these various government agencies is that they fit
under two large umbrellas. Some of them really are United States federal agen-
cies; they are an actual part of the government just as are Congress, the jet
102
Part II: Numerous and Varied Ways to Make Money in Bonds 

engines on Air Force One, and the fancy silverware at the White House. Such
official agencies include the General Services Administration, the Government
National Mortgage Association, and the Small Business Administration. The
U.S. Post Office also once issued bonds but has not done so lately.
Most of the so-called agencies, however, aren’t quite parts of the government.
They are, technically speaking, government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs): cor-
porations created by Congress to work for the common good but then set out
more or less on their own. Many of these faux agencies are publicly held,
issuing stock on the major exchanges. Such pseudo-agencies include the
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and the Federal National Mortgage
Association. You notice, of course, that these nongovernmental enterprises
start with the word “Federal.” Confusing, isn’t it?!
What’s the difference between the two groups, especially with regard to their
bonds? The first group (the official-government group) issues bonds that
carry the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. The second group, well,
their bonds carry that mysterious implicit guarantee or moral obligation.
Because this second group is much larger than the first — both in terms of
the number of agencies and the value of the bonds they issue — when invest-
ment experts speak of “agency bonds,” they are almost always talking about
the bonds of the GSEs.
There are many GSEs, but the three represented in Figure 7-1 issue the vast
majority of bonds.

Chapter 7: Lots of Protection (and Just a Touch of Confusion): Agency Bonds

Sizing up the government’s 
actual commitment
No GSE has yet to default on its bonds. The closest we’ve ever seen was the
Federal Farm Credit Banks (FFCB) during the 1980s when banks were fore-
closing on small farms faster than a swarm of locusts can chew up a crop. No
FFCB bonds were defaulted, but nervousness in the markets caused their
prices to plunge. Would the Treasury have stepped in to save the day if the
crisis continued? In theory, yes. But because the theory has never really been
put to the test, investors got sweaty palms.
Those who sold their FFCB bonds prior to maturity lost a bundle. Of course,
those intrepid investors who scooped up the bonds at bargain prices made a
mint.
Because of the very small risk of default inherent in agency bonds and the
greater risk of price volatility due to public sentiment, agency bonds tend to
pay higher rates of interest than Treasury bonds, although not a heck of a lot
more. The spread between Treasuries and the faux-agency bonds is typically
within half a percentage point, if even that much. As for the real government
agencies, such as the Small Business Administration, which issue bonds
backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, the difference in
yield between their bonds and Treasuries would be so small as to be almost
immeasurable.
Introducing the agency biggies
To give you an idea of what GSEs are and what they do, I describe here the
three largest (and most popular with retail investors) issuers of agency
bonds: the Federal National Mortgage Association (known colloquially as
Fannie Mae), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac),
and the Federal Home Loan Banks.
Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae)
Fannie Mae, which dates back to 1968, raises money by selling bonds. It then
turns some of that money over to banks. The banks use the money to make
loans, mostly to homebuyers (believe it or not, 63 million homebuyers and
counting).
Most Fannie Mae bonds (generally available in increments of $1,000) are pur-
chased by institutions: insurance companies, other nation’s central banks
(especially China’s), university endowments, and so on. But individual
104
Part II: Numerous and Varied Ways to Make Money in Bonds 

investors are certainly welcome to join in the fun, too. The agency issues
bonds of varying maturities; and, naturally, there’s a large secondary market
where you can find any maturity from several months to many years down
the pike. Fannie Mae sounds like a public agency, but it is really a private cor-
poration with government oversight. For more information, see www.fannie
mae.com.
If you believe that agency debt belongs in your portfolio (it certainly isn’t a
necessity, but it’s a good option for many investors), Fannie Mae bonds may
be an okay choice. It all depends on the price your broker offers you. Note
that Fannie Mae bonds may be traditional interest-bearing bonds, or they
may be mortgage-backed bonds. If you are considering the mortgage-backed
variety, please make sure to read what I write about them later in this chap-
ter. They are not for everyone!
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac)
This agency (which is also, technically, a private corporation tied to the gov-
ernment) was formed in 1970 and is very similar to Fannie Mae. So are its
multitude of bond issues with their many maturities, denominations of
$1,000, and choice of traditional or mortgage-backed.
Freddie Mac buys one residential mortgage every seven seconds and, by so
doing, helps to finance one in six homes in the United States. Most of the
mortgages are purchased from primary lenders (such as your neighborhood
bank). With the money those lenders get from Freddie Mac, they can go out
and make more loans.
Like Fannie Maes, most Freddie Macs are bought by institutions. For more
information, see www.freddiemac.com.
Federal Home Loan Banks
This is not a single agency but a coalition of 12 regional banks formed in 1932.
Its mission is to fund low-income housing and housing projects. The money
used for the funding comes from — you guessed it — selling bonds. Lots of
bonds.
This coalition is far and away the largest issuer of so-called agency bonds.
These bonds are a bit more popular with individual investors than Freddies
and Fannies — as well they should be, at least for those in higher tax brack-
ets: The interest earned is exempt from state and local taxes. For more infor-
mation, see www.fhlbanks.com.
Like Fannies and Freddies, the FHLB bonds come in many different flavors as
far as denominations and maturities.
105
Chapter 7: Lots of Protection (and Just a Touch of Confusion): Agency Bonds

Comparing and Contrasting 
Agency Bonds
All agency bonds are considered high quality with very little risk of default. The
honest-and-true federal agencies, such as the Small Business Administration
(SBA), are said to have no risk of default; therefore, their bonds pay more or
less what Treasuries do (see Chapter 5). You may get a smidgen more interest
(maybe 5 basis points, or 5/100 of 1 percent) to compensate you for the lesser
liquidity of such agency bonds (the lesser ability to sell them in a flash).
The majority of agency bonds are issued by government-sponsored enter-
prises (GSEs), and the risk of default, although real, is probably next to noth-
ing. You get a higher rate of interest on these bonds than you do with
Treasuries to compensate you for the fact that the risk of default does exist. 
With all agency bonds, you pay a markup when you buy and sell, which you
don’t with Treasuries if you buy them directly from the government. (I discuss
buying and selling Treasuries in Chapter 5.) If you’re not careful, that markup
could easily eat up your first several months of earnings. It also could make
the difference between agency bonds and Treasury bonds a wash.
106
Part II: Numerous and Varied Ways to Make Money in Bonds 
An agency that broke its ties: Student Loan
Marketing Association (Sallie Mae)
The Student Loan Marketing Association, other-
wise known as Sallie Mae, owns and manages
student loans for 10 million Americans. It used
to be a government-sponsored enterprise (GSE)
like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. But in 2004,
after some years in transition, Sallie Mae
became a private corporation with no govern-
ment ties whatsoever. However, the millions and
millions of dollars in bonds issued by Sallie Mae
under its status as a GSE are currently grand-
fathered as agency debt, and will be until their
maturity. If anything happens to Sallie Mae, the
U.S. government has taken on a moral obliga-
tion to pay back the principal on Sallie Mae
bonds — at least those issued prior to 2004.
If you buy a Sallie Mae issued prior to 2004,
expect a price and yield comparable to other
agency bonds. If you buy a Sallie Mae issued
post-2004, expect a price and yield comparable
to corporate bonds of similar quality. In either
case, ask yourself if agency bonds or corporate
bonds truly belong in your portfolio, and do 
your research (as outlined in Chapter 15) to
compare and contrast these with other bonds
to make sure you are getting the best invest-
ment possible.

Most agency bonds pay a fixed rate of interest twice a year. About 25 percent of
them are callable, meaning that the agencies issuing the bonds have the right
to cancel the bond and give you back your principal. The other 75 percent are
non-callable bonds (sometimes referred to as bullet bonds). Callable bonds
tend to pay somewhat higher rates of interest, but your investment takes on 
a certain degree of uncertainty. (See Chapter 6 for more on callability.)
Investing in individual agency bonds, or individual bonds of any kind, for that
matter, is not an activity for poor people. Although you may be able to get into
the game for as little as $1,000, bond brokers typically mark up such small
transactions to the point that they simply don’t make sense. I wouldn’t sug-
gest even looking at individual agency bonds unless you’ve got at least $50,000
to invest in a pop. Otherwise, you should be looking at bond funds, or individ-
ual Treasuries that you can buy without paying any markup whatsoever.
When choosing among different agencies, you want to carefully compare
yields-to-maturity (see Chapter 4) and make sure that you know full well
whether you are buying a traditional bond or a mortgage-backed security.
They are totally different animals.
Weighing taxation matters
The taxes you pay on agency bonds vary. Interest from bonds issued by
Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae is fully taxable. The interest on most other
agency bonds — including the king of agency bonds, the Federal Home Loan
Banks — is exempt from state and local tax.
Treasury bonds, which most resemble agency bonds, are always exempt from
state and local tax. Municipal bonds are almost always free from federal tax.
Needless to say, your personal tax bracket will make some bonds look better
than others. I help you to better measure the effect of taxation on your bond
selections in Chapter 8.
Making like John Travolta
Some agencies, in addition to issuing traditional bonds that pay semiannual
interest, also issue no-coupon discount notes, known among bond traders as
discos. Discos are similar to Treasury bills. They usually carry short-term
maturities (up to one year), sell at a discount, and pay all interest along with
principal at maturity. They are used more by institutions than by individuals,
and it is probably better that way: Most individuals who buy bonds tend to
enjoy the more regular income. I mention discos here mostly to appease your
curiosity, should you come across the interesting term. They have nothing to
do with dancing.
107
Chapter 7: Lots of Protection (and Just a Touch of Confusion): Agency Bonds

Another type of agency bond is called a floater. The coupon rate of a floater is
based on some benchmark, such as the three-month T-bill (Treasury bill)
rate, and can change from month to month. These are complicated beasts,
and I suggest steering clear. Fixed-income investments should be fixed.
Not quite as unpredictable as the floater, yet another kind of agency bond is
known as a step-up. With a step-up, you get a coupon rate that “steps up”
according to a pre-set calendar. As time rolls on, you may collect more inter-
est. Step-ups can be good investments in that they shield you from having to
eat crow with a low-interest investment when interest rates are on the rise.
The problem with them is that they are typically callable, which means the
agency can toss your principal back to you at any time, and you’re left hold-
ing cold cash with perhaps nowhere to go.
Banking Your Money on Other 
People’s Mortgages
Far more complicated even than floaters are the mortgage-backed securities
issued by federal agencies such as the Government National Mortgage
Association (GNMA), otherwise known as Ginnie Mae, and some government-
sponsored enterprises, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (see “Introducing
the agency biggies” earlier in the chapter).
Mortgage-backed securities are very different from most other bonds. They
do not offer as consistent and predictable a stream of interest income as do
most bonds.
Bathing in the mortgage pool
When you purchase a mortgage-backed security from, say, Ginnie Mae (mini-
mum investment $25,000), your money goes into a pool of mortgages. Whereas
most bonds pay you a set rate of interest, usually twice a year, mortgage-
backed securities pay you a certain rate of interest plus the steady or not-so-
steady return of your principal. (You don’t get a big lump sum when the bond
matures.) Most mortgage-backed securities issue monthly payments.
The amount of principal you get back on a monthly basis is determined
largely by the rate at which mortgage-holders pay off their debt. If interest
rates drop and thousands of the mortgage-holders decide to suddenly prepay
their existing mortgages (in order to refinance), you may get back your prin-
cipal much faster than you had anticipated. In a sense, a mortgage-backed
security has the same back-at-ya risk as a callable bond.
108
Part II: Numerous and Varied Ways to Make Money in Bonds 

Deciding whether to invest 
in the housing market
You don’t need to invest the $25,000 minimum required by Ginnie Mae to
invest in mortgage-back securities. You can get a Freddie Mac for as little as
$1,000. But should you?
No, I don’t think so.
Neither does David Lambert, a financial planning colleague of mine who is
currently with Valley National Financial Advisers in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania,
and formerly the head trader at the agency-bond desk for a major Wall Street
firm. This guy knows a lot about agency bonds. “If I were a retail investor,
unless I had a really huge amount of money and felt that I really knew what I
was doing, I wouldn’t invest directly in mortgage-backed securities,” Lambert
says. “The complexity of them makes them inappropriate for the average
investor.”
Instead, says Lambert, if you want to invest in mortgage-backed securities,
do so by investing in, say, a good Ginnie Mae mutual fund. “There are plenty
of competent mortgage-backed fund managers out there. I’d look to a mutual-
fund company like Vanguard or Fidelity,” he says. I discuss bond funds, and
mutual-fund companies such as Vanguard and Fidelity (both of which I also
like), in depth in Chapter 16.
Considering Agencies for Your Portfolio
You don’t need agency bonds. Their overall characteristics are similar
enough to Treasuries that the substitution of one for the other isn’t likely to
make any huge difference in either the risk profile or the potential return of
your overall portfolio. If, however, you are a smart bond buyer (which you
certainly can be after reading this book!), substituting agency bonds for
Treasuries may garner you a few extra bucks.
Mortgage-backed bonds, perhaps best purchased in mutual-fund form, add a
smidgen of added diversification to a portfolio and potentially a touch more
interest than do most other agency bonds. Again, there’s no urgency to add
mortgage-backed bonds to a portfolio, but if you have a large fixed-income
allocation, a position in mortgage-backed bonds may make sense. Generally,
you do better with mortgage-backed securities than traditional bonds when
prevailing interest rates are stable. They tend to chug along or droop when
interest rates begin to bounce.
109
Chapter 7: Lots of Protection (and Just a Touch of Confusion): Agency Bonds

Given their overall safety, agency bonds tend to be conservative investments
and produce modest rates of return. Therefore, you must make sure that the
return isn’t eaten up in transaction costs or management fees.
If you plan to invest in an agency bond fund or funds, make sure you comb
through Chapter 16 to find one with reasonable expenses. And if you think
you may want to invest in individual agency bonds, read Chapter 15 so you
don’t get clipped with a high broker markup. Can’t decide which is right for
you, fund or individual bond? Chapter 13 is here to help!

“I’m proud to be paying taxes in the United States. The only thing is — I

–– Arthur Godfrey
W
ould you believe that this quote from the famous dead guy actually
appeared on the home page of the official Internal Revenue Service
Web site? No kidding. Who says these guys don’t have a sense of humor?
No one, probably not even the Webmaster for the IRS Web site, likes paying
taxes. That’s why municipal bonds (commonly called munis), with their juicy
exempt-from-federal-tax status, are such a darling investment, especially for
those Camembert- and Evian-gulping folks in the northern tax brackets.
Perhaps you’re an anti-government zealot who stockpiles guns in your linen
closet for the upcoming revolution, and you’d rather die than pay taxes to
Uncle Sam. In that case, munis should be your bond of choice. If you’d
describe yourself in slightly more rational terms, what matters most is not
the taxes you pay or don’t pay, but what you take home at the end of the day.

That means that munis may make sense for you, or they may not. Munis, you
see, typically pay considerably lower rates of interest than do taxable bonds.
If you’re a rational person, a municipal bond paying 4 percent, for example,
would outshine a taxable bond paying 8 percent only if your tax bracket were
way north of Norway.
In this chapter, I reveal the formula to figure out whether a tax-free muni will
likely mean greater take-home than a comparable taxable bond. (It’s a simple
formula, really; no Ph.D. in mathematics necessary.) But I also point out that
the formula should be used merely as a starting point. Munis may or may not
belong in your portfolio for other reasons, as well, regardless of what you
keep in your linen closet.
Appreciating the Purpose 
and Power of Munis
If not for the fact that municipal bonds are exempt from federal income tax,
they would likely be about as popular as buttermilk at a college keg party. 
On the day I’m writing this chapter, for example, high quality munis with 
maturities of five years out are yielding an average of 3.75 percent. Five-year
Treasuries, meanwhile, are currently yielding 4.75 percent — about one-quarter
more the return. (Keep in mind that Treasuries aren’t exactly world-famous for
their high returns.) And while the munis carry some (limited) risk, the
Treasuries do not.
But of course, munis are tax-exempt.
Why is that? Because in 1895, the Supremes (nine guys in black robes, not the
lady singers) decided on a case involving “intergovernmental tax immunity.”
In essence, they ruled that the federal government had no right to mess with
any local government’s efforts to raise money. And the Supremes determined
that taxing local bonds would, in fact, be a form of messing. From that point
on, interest on municipal bonds has been largely untouched by those fun-
loving Arthur Godfrey fans at the IRS.
When anyone in Washington is ever inclined to challenge that 1895 ruling (oh,
yes, it does happen from time to time), he or she never gets very far. That’s
because the tax-exempt status of munis allows local governments, such as
your township, to issue bonds that carry very modest interest rates. If local
governments across the United States couldn’t issue those bonds — couldn’t
get those relatively cheap loans — we’d probably start seeing potholes in the
112
Part II: Numerous and Varied Ways to Make Money in Bonds 

street as big as Rhode Island. A drying up of cheap loans might mean a drying
up of ports; bridges and tunnels might not get built; and construction of new
schools and low-income housing projects might come to a crawl.
Sizing up the muni market
About $2.3 trillion in municipal bonds is held primarily by U.S. households.
That’s roughly 15 percent of all household bond holdings. That’s also about
half of the entire market for U.S. government debt. Munis, undoubtedly
because of their tantalizing tax advantage, are the only major kind of bond
more popular with individual investors than with institutions. About two-
thirds of all munis find themselves either in some normal Joe’s portfolio or in
a mutual or exchange-traded fund.
So who or what exactly issues these tax-exempt wonders, and what other
qualities distinguish them from all other bonds? I’m so glad you asked!
The issuers of municipal bonds include, of course, municipalities (duh), such
as cities and towns. But they also include counties, public universities, certain
private universities, airports, not-for-profit hospitals, public power plants,
water and sewer administrations, various and sundry nonprofit organizations,
bridge and tunnel authorities, housing authorities, and an occasional research
foundation.
Any government, local agency, nonprofit, or what-have-you that is deemed 
to serve the public good, with a blessing from the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the IRS (and sometimes voters), may have the honor of issu-
ing a municipal bond.
Comparing and contrasting 
with other bonds
The tax-exempt status of munis is unquestionably their most notable and
easily recognizable characteristic — the equivalent of Kojak’s cue ball or
Groucho Marx’s mustache.
Like most bonds, munis come with differing maturities. Some mature in a
year or less, others in 20 or 30 years. Unlike most bonds, munis tend to be
issued in minimal denominations of $5,000 and multiples of $5,000 (not a min-
imum of $1,000 and multiples of $1,000, like corporate bonds and Treasuries).
113
Chapter 8: (Almost) Tax-Free Havens: Municipal Bonds

Like many corporate bonds, but unlike Treasuries, many municipal bonds are
callable, meaning the issuer can kick back your money and sever your rela-
tionship before the bond matures. Like other bonds, the interest rate on
munis is generally fixed, but the price of the bond can go up and down;
unless you hold your bond to maturity, you may or may not get your princi-
pal returned whole. If the maturity is many years off, the price of the bond
can go up and down considerably.
Delighting in the diversification 
of municipals
The tax-exempt status of munis isn’t the only reason they may belong in your
portfolio. Municipal bonds also offer a fair degree of diversification, even
from other bonds.
Because they are the only kind of bond more popular with households than
with institutions, the muni market is swayed more by public demand than the
markets for other bonds. For example, when the stock market tanks and indi-
vidual investors get butterflies in their stomachs, they tend to sell out of their
stock holdings (often a mistake) and load up on what they see as less risky
investments, such as munis.
When the demand for munis goes up, just as when the demand for, say, gold
or oil goes up, it tends to drive prices higher. Popular demand or lack of
demand for munis typically affects their prices more than it does the price of
corporate bonds and Treasuries. Those taxable bonds, in contrast, tend to be
more interest-rate sensitive than munis. As I discuss in Chapter 3, when inter-
est rates rise, bond prices generally fall; when interest rates drop, bond
prices tend to move up.
As an example of the kind of diversification I’m talking about, consider that in
2005, investment-grade (high quality) corporate bonds returned a measly
1.35 percent. (Interest rates were rising, so even though the bonds were
paying fair coupon rates, the price of the bonds fell considerably.) Meanwhile
munis overall returned an impressive tax-free 3.51 percent in 2005. But in
other years, say 2003, for example (when interest rates were falling and bond
prices were moving in the opposite direction), investment-grade corporate
bonds returned an unusually delightful 11.81 percent, and municipal bonds
returned a comparatively weak 5.31 percent.
114

Knowing That All Cities (Bridges 
or Ports) Are Not Created Equal
Like the corporations that issue corporate bonds, the entities (cities, hospi-
tals, universities, and so on) that issue municipal bonds are of varying eco-
nomic strength — although the degree of variance isn’t nearly as large as it is
in the corporate world.
One study looked at bond defaults between the years 1970 and 2000. Of all
the muni bonds rated by credit-rating agency Moody’s during that 30-year
period (about 80 percent of the dollar volume of all municipal offerings), only
18 defaults occurred. That compares to 819 corporate-bond defaults during
the same period.
Of those 18 municipal defaults reported in the study, 10 were healthcare facil-
ities. All the defaulted bonds were revenue bonds; none were general obliga-
tion bonds. General obligation bonds are secured by the full faith and credit of
the issuer and are typically supported by that issuer’s power to tax the hell
out of the citizenry, if necessary. Revenue bonds’ interest and principal are
secured only by the revenue derived from a specific project. If the project
goes bust, so does the bond.
Enjoying low risk
The same study from Moody’s also found a huge difference in recovery rates
of munis as compared to other bonds. The recovery rate is the amount of
money bondholders get back after the dust of a default settles. On defaulted
munis from 1970 to 2000, the recovery rate was 66 percent of the face value of
the bonds. In contrast, the poor corporate bondholders got back only 42 per-
cent of the face value on their defaulted bonds.
So by and large, municipal bonds are very safe animals — at least those rated
by the major rating agencies (such as Moody’s), which are the vast majority
of munis. If the mild nature of the beast weren’t enough to put your investing
soul at ease, know that roughly two-thirds of municipal bonds issued today
come insured; you can’t lose your principal unless the issuer and its insur-
ance company go under. That is very unlikely to happen! And even if the
insurance company were to fail, the general feeling among industry insiders
is that most states would be very, very reluctant to allow one of their cities to
default on a general obligation bond.

Chapter 8: (Almost) Tax-Free Havens: Municipal Bonds

Municipal bonds, like corporate bonds, are rated by the major bond-rating
agencies. But they have their very own rating system. (If municipalities were
rated using the corporate ratings, almost all would hug the very top of the
scale.) In Table 8-1, I show the ratings used by three major bond-rating agen-
cies: Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s, and Fitch.

Choosing from a vast array of possibilities
You definitely want munis that are rated. Some municipal offerings are not
rated, and these can be risky investments or very illiquid (you may not be
able to sell them when you want, if at all). I suggest going with the top-rated
munis: Moody’s Aaa or Aa. The lower rated munis may give you a wee bit
extra yield but probably are not worth the added risk.
Keep in mind that a lower rated bond can be more volatile than a high rated
bond. Default isn’t the only risk.
A good number of munis come insured, offering almost absolute safety. You
lose a little bit in interest by opting for the insurance guarantee. As long as a
muni is rated high and is a general obligation muni (not a revenue muni), con-
sider going without the insurance for the drop of extra juice. General obliga-
tion bonds generally don’t default. That’s not to say it can’t ever happen, but
I’d say the odds are greater that my dog, Norman, will run for public office.
Of course, you also want to choose a municipal bond that carries a maturity
you can live with. If the bond is callable, well, is that something you can live
116
Part II: Numerous and Varied Ways to Make Money in Bonds 

with and be happy with? Callable bonds pay slightly higher coupon rates but
are less predictable than noncallable bonds. (See Chapter 6 for further dis-
cussion of callability.)
But perhaps most importantly, because the tax-free status of the muni is
undoubtedly a prime motivation for buying a muni in the first place, you want
to consider whether you want to buy a national muni or a state muni, and if
you buy a state muni, do you want double- or triple-tax-free? Here’s the
scoop:
 National munis are exempt from federal tax but are not necessarily
exempt from state income tax. (Some states tax bond coupon payments
and others do not.)
 State munis, if purchased by residents of the same state, are typically
exempt from state tax, if there is one. Some, but not all, state munis are
also exempt from all local taxes.
 Munis that are exempt from both federal and state tax are called double-
tax-free bonds. Those exempt from federal, state, and local tax are often
referred to as triple-tax-free bonds.
You need to do a bit of math to determine which kind is better for you:
national or state, double- or triple-tax-free. If math doesn’t frighten you too
much, read on! Keep in mind, however, that the formulas I’m about to give
you should be used only as rough guides. Consult your tax adviser before
laying out any big money on munis. The tax rules are complicated and for-
ever changing. Some states impose taxes on you if you invest in other states’
munis; others do not. Some states even tax you if you invest in munis in your
own state. Certain bonds issued in Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories are
free from almost all taxation regardless of where you live. It’s a jungle out
there!
Consulting the Taxman
Your personal federal tax bracket, as well as the income taxes you pay in
your particular state and perhaps to your local government, has a great bear-
ing on whether munis make sense for you and, if so, what kind of munis.
“If you’re in the highest tax brackets, especially if you live in a high-tax state
like California or New York, you’d have to have your head examined if you
buy any kind of bond except for an in-state muni,” says Marilyn Cohen, a
bond-manager buddy of mine who has helped build more bond portfolios
than Henry Ford built cars.
117
Chapter 8: (Almost) Tax-Free Havens: Municipal Bonds

On the other hand, says Cohen, some people choose to invest in munis only
because they have such a revulsion to taxes. “Those people need to have
their heads examined, too!” she says. For many of them, especially those in
the lower tax brackets in states that tax little or none, munis clearly make no
economic sense.
Bringing your bracket to bear
So let’s determine whether you and I need to have our heads examined, 
shall we?
When looking at a national muni — a bond that is exempt from federal tax
only — it isn’t very hard to determine whether your after-tax take-home will
be greater with that bond or with a fully taxable bond. For illustration pur-
poses, let’s suppose we are comparing two bonds: a $5,000 Metropolis muni
paying 5 percent, and a $5,000 taxable bond from the International Dummies
Consolidated Corporation (IDCC) paying 6.5 percent.
First, determine your tax bracket. Take a look at Table 8-2, which is based on
IRS rules for 2007. It shows the likely percent of tax you’ll pay on any interest
from a taxable bond.

Okay, got your tax bracket? Good. Now you can compare the take-home from
the IDCC taxable bond to the federally tax-exempt Metropolis municipal 20-
year bond paying 5 percent a year.
Start with 100 . . . a good round number. Subtract your tax bracket. Let’s sup-
pose you are in the 28 percent bracket. 100 – 28 = 72. That number — 72 —
we’ll call the reciprocal of your tax bracket. When you have the reciprocal, all
you need is to divide the municipal yield by the reciprocal and it will tell you,
just like magic, what you would have to earn on the taxable bond to equal the
amount you would get on the tax-exempt muni.
So, in this particular case, Metropolis muni is paying 5 percent. Divide 5 by 72
(the reciprocal of your tax bracket), and you get 6.94 percent.
That number, 6.94, represents your tax-equivalent yield, or your break-even
between taxable and tax-exempt bond investing. If you can get 5 percent on a
muni versus 6.94 percent on a taxable bond, go flip a coin. It won’t matter
which you choose, as far as take-home pay. (Of course, other factors may
matter, such as the quality or the maturity of the bond.) If the taxable bond 
is paying more than 6.94 percent, the taxable bond will likely be your best
bet. If the taxable bond is paying less than 6.94 percent, you’re better off with
the muni.
119
Chapter 8: (Almost) Tax-Free Havens: Municipal Bonds

Back to our example, if the IDCC taxable bond is paying only 6.5 percent, you
are better off, most likely, with the Metropolis tax-free bond paying 5 percent.
So far, so good?
Singling our your home state
Life in these United States is rarely simple. Chances are that you live in a
state with income tax. Most people do.
In that case, figuring out your tax-equivalent yield is no longer a simple
matter. State taxes, you see, are deductible from your federal taxes. So to
figure out your tax-equivalent yield requires more math than any normal
person with an Internet connection should ever have to suffer.
So instead of walking you through the long and painful formula, I’m simply
going to suggest that you log onto one of the 50,000 tax-equivalent yield cal-
culators on the Internet. One of my favorites is to be found on www.dinky-
town.com. Click Investments in the column on the left side of your screen.
Then click on Municipal Bond Tax Equivalent Yield. You can plug in your
state income tax, and the calculator will show you the tax-equivalent yields,
in colorful chart form, for federally exempt munis as well as munis exempt
from state and local taxes.

Matching munis to the 
appropriate accounts
Municipal bonds, like any tax-free investment, make most sense in a taxable
account. In fact, I’d say that putting a muni into any kind of tax-advantaged
account, such as an IRA or Roth IRA, makes about as much sense as putting a
kidney pie on a vegetarian buffet.
If you’re looking to fill your IRA with fixed-income investments (which may 
or may not make sense; see Chapter 13), don’t be looking at munis. Taxable
bonds provide greater return, and if the taxes can be postponed (as in an
122
Part II: Numerous and Varied Ways to Make Money in Bonds 

IRA) or avoided (as in a Roth IRA), then taxable bonds are almost always the
way to go.
Recognizing Why This Chapter is Titled
“(Almost) Tax-Free Havens”
Will you never pay federal tax on a tax-exempt muni? Never say never. There
are instances, rare as they may be, where the tax can grab you from behind
and make you not want to wake up on the morning of April 15.
Reckoning with the AMT tax
The alternative minimum tax (AMT) is complicated enough to make Albert
Einstein pull at his already pulled-looking hair. The AMT is a federal tax that
exists in a parallel universe (Albert proved that they exist), which you enter
unwillingly when you make a fair chunk of change, claim too many exemp-
tions, or take too many deductions. Ask your tax guru if you are likely to be
smacked by AMT at any point in the near future. If so, you may want to hand-
pick your munis (and muni funds) to include only those that are exempt from
the AMT.
In general, the interest on municipal bonds sold by state and local govern-
ments to finance very specific projects, as well as bonds issued by not-for-
profit organizations and other “private activity” issuers such as airports and
universities, is going to be included in the AMT. So if you are liable to pay the
AMT, the tax-exempt status of these bonds will no longer be so exempt.
If you’re not liable to pay the AMT, buying up these AMT bonds may make
good sense because they tend to provide a slightly higher yield than do non-
AMT bonds.
Capping your capital gains
If you buy a security at a certain price and then sell it at a higher price, that’s
a good thing! But you may be subject to pay capital gains tax to the IRS . . .
even if the security you sold is a tax-exempt municipal bond. If you pay
$1,000 to pick up a muni selling at par, and you later sell it for $1,100, you
very likely owe the government capital gains tax on your $100. If the buy and
sell both occur within a one-year period, the tax hit will likely be 28 percent,
123
Chapter 8: (Almost) Tax-Free Havens: Municipal Bonds

33 percent, or whatever your normal marginal income tax rate happens to be.
If your buy and sell span a period of more than one year, you need to pay
long-term capital gains, which for most folks amounts to 15 percent.
(The tax rules governing municipal zero-coupon bonds bought at a discount
and then sold at a lesser discount or a premium can be complicated; talk to
your tax advisor.)
What pertains to individual bonds also pertains to municipal bond mutual
funds. Sell your shares for more than you purchased them, and you’ll have to
pay capital gains. Of course, if you sell at a loss, whether a bond or a bond
fund, you may then declare a capital-gains tax loss, which is usually used to
write off capital gains.
Introducing the fully taxable muni. Huh? Say whaa?
At first glance, a taxable muni seems about as sensible as a race horse run-
ning in a yoke, but in fact, taxable munis offer potential return comparable to
investment-grade corporate bonds or agency bonds, and sometimes they
may make for an excellent bond choice. Taxable municipal bonds exist on the
market because the federal government will not give a break to the financing
of certain activities that it perceives do not offer a significant benefit to the
public. The funding of a new hockey stadium or the refunding of a municipal-
ity’s ailing pension plan are two examples of muni bond issues that would be
federally taxable. They barely existed a decade or two ago but are becoming
more and more popular.
Buying Munis Made Easier
Perhaps because the muni bond market is made up mostly of individuals
rather than institutional buyers, the number of sharks in fancy suits out to
rip the hide off unwary investors is highest in the muni bond market. Buyer
beware! I’ve seen examples of people paying markups on individual bonds in
some cases exceeding a full year’s interest.
If you’re interested (and can stomach it!), there’s a Web site called www.
municipalbonds.com, run by Kevin Olson, a former muni bond trader
turned independent investor advocate. Olson delights in updating his Web
site every day with municipal bond trades that should never have happened:
trades with ridiculously high spreads between buys and sells, trades where
individual investors got hurt. (Click on the red flag icon at the bottom of the
home page.)
124
Part II: Numerous and Varied Ways to Make Money in Bonds 

If you’re buying individual munis on your own, you want to take full advan-
tage of all the latest consumer tools that allow you, in many cases, to get a
pretty good idea what kind of markup the bond broker is shooting to make.
You don’t want one of your trades to appear on Olson’s Web site! If you go to
a Web site such as www.investinginbonds.com or www.finra.org, you
can research individual bonds to see the prices paid for past transactions. If
the bond was traded recently, that should give you some idea whether a
broker is offering you a fair price. The easiest way to research an individual
bond is to ask the broker for its CUSIP number, and then plug that number
into the Web site’s search function.
Bond funds may make better sense altogether. By buying in bulk and using
their professional prowess, fund managers can often get better deals than
you can get buying bonds on your own. But, of course, funds charge you a
yearly management fee, and given the low yields of munis, you don’t want 
to pay too much for a fund. In fact, you want to pay as little as you can.
Whichever way you decide to go — individual bonds or municipal bond
funds — Chapters 15 and 16 give you all the practical advice you need to
build your muni bond portfolio wisely.

once saw a cartoon showing an American-looking couple standing in a
street in what looks like Mexico, watching a group of small children at
play. The cartoon husband turns to the cartoon wife and cartoonishly says,
“Isn’t it amazing how these kids can conjugate all those verbs?”
What’s amazing is how something that appears exotic to one person in one
part of the world can be so run-of-the-mill to another. Consider that more
than 60 percent of all fixed-income offerings exist outside the borders of the
United States. To the hordes of well-heeled Europeans and Asians who invest
in them, these bonds are about as exciting as bread and rice. Yet to the aver-
age Yank, an investment in a foreign bond may be considered as exotic as
sautéed sea urchin in black truffle sauce.
In this chapter, I talk not only about foreign bonds but also about some rather
unusual and, in some cases, even somewhat quirky bond offerings to be found
closer to U.S. shores. None of the bonds discussed in this chapter are a must
for your portfolio (some I would consider almost must-nots), but sprinkled
throughout are a few bond options possibly worth your consideration.

Traveling Abroad for Fixed Income
The ratio between what we Americans invest in domestic bonds and what we
invest in foreign bonds is somewhere in the ballpark (cricketfield) of 34 to 1.
Given the gargantuan size of the foreign bond market, you may find that a bit
surprising — especially because foreign bonds sometimes make very sensi-
ble investments, even to people in Kansas.
When most investments professionals look at the world of global fixed income,
they see two large categories of bonds. First, there are developed-world bonds.
Second, for those who like to wash down their sautéed sea urchin with baby-
bamboo-and-guava juice, there are emerging-market bonds.
Dipping into developed-world bonds
Just as the U.S. government and corporations issue bonds, so too do the
governments and corporations of Canada, England, France, Italy, Germany,
Sweden, Japan, Switzerland, and many other countries, large and small, hot
and cold, rich and not-so-rich. True, it may be difficult to find a decent sir-
loin in some of these distant lands, but that doesn’t mean their fixed-income
offerings are all chopped meat. As you can see in Table 9-1, in any particular
year, any developed nation’s offerings may top the list of the world’s highest
yielding bonds.

What are they?
Whether they are issued by corporations or by governments, foreign bonds,
like U.S. bonds, come in all sorts of varying maturities and credit qualities.
Some are dollar-denominated; these are often called Yankee bonds. But most
are denominated in the currency of their home countries, be it Euros,
pounds, yen, or Krona.
Over the long run, you can expect that bonds of similar credit quality and
duration, bearing similar risk, should yield roughly equal returns, no matter
in which country they are issued or sold. After all, if, say, British bonds con-
sistently paid higher rates of interest than U.S. bonds, investment money
would start to float eastward across the big pond. U.S. bond issuers, such 
as the Treasury, the State of California, and Exxon Mobil, would eventually
either have to up their coupon rates or raise capital another way, such as
bake sales or bingo games.
In the short run, however, interest rates can vary among bond markets, and
more importantly, exchange rates can fluctuate wildly. For that reason, U.S.
investors putting their money into foreign fixed income are generally looking
at a fairly volatile investment with modest returns. (All fixed-income invest-
ments generally see modest returns.) On the flip side, foreign bonds, espe-
cially non-dollar-denominated bonds, tend to have limited correlation to U.S.
bonds (meaning their value is independent of U.S. bonds), so owning some
foreign fixed income in developed countries can be a sensible diversifier.
Figure 9-1 offers a nice snapshot of the performance of U.S. versus foreign
fixed-income securities from 1986 through March 2007.
Should you invest?
Investing in individual bonds is tricky. Investing in individual foreign bonds 
is trickier — kinda like buying a villa in Venice as opposed to a condo in
Connecticut. To tap into the foreign fixed-income market, you’re better off
looking at investing through a mutual fund. Most foreign-bond mutual funds
129
Chapter 9: Global Bonds and Other Seemingly Exotic Offerings

are fairly pricey, charging at least a percentage point a year in management
fees. Is the diversifying power of foreign bonds worth that added expense?
Just as importantly, is the added volatility that accompanies most foreign
fixed-income investments worth the ride?
The answer (I apologize; please don’t hate me): It depends.

If you are still going to work every morning, still in the accumulation phase of
your investing career, and already have a good percentage of your portfolio
in foreign currency–based investments, such as foreign stock mutual funds or
exchange-traded funds, then holding foreign bonds won’t serve all that much
purpose. If, however, you have a large bond portfolio (say $200,000 or more),
and especially if you are living off those bonds, then putting a certain amount
of your bond portfolio into foreign bonds — maybe a fifth or a quarter — may
make a lot of sense. The diversification effect could help smooth out your
total portfolio returns and possibly boost performance.
Please don’t make the assumption that you can predict currency fluctuations
and start loading up on foreign bond (or stock) funds as a way to speculate
on a falling dollar. Currency exchange is as unpredictable as Britney Spears’s
behavior. Don’t try it. You’ll likely lose. If you buy into a foreign bond fund, do
it only for the diversification benefit, and keep the allocation modest.
In Chapter 16, I provide the names of various mutual funds that offer expo-
sure to foreign developed-world bonds at a relatively reasonable price. Most
of these funds offer pure unhedged exposure. A few are dollar-hedged. When
a fund is dollar-hedged, that means the manager is using sophisticated finan-
cial tools (usually currency futures) to offset any currency flux. These hedged
funds (not to be confused with hedge funds) are less volatile than the cur-
rency unhedged funds. But you will lose a lot of the diversification power.

Embracing the bonds of emerging-market
nations
Emerging markets is something of a euphemism for “poor countries.” Those
who invest in them hope that these nations are emerging, but no one can say
with any certainty. In any case, if you want to buy bonds issued in Brazil,
Turkey, Russia, Venezuela, Mexico, or Argentina, the opportunities are out
there. The interest rates can be nose-bleed high; the volatility can be enough
to make your stomach contents start emerging.
What are they?
The majority of emerging-market bonds are so-called sovereign bonds. That
title sounds like it may have something to do with kings and queens, but all
sovereign means is that these bonds are issued by federal governments. U.S.
Treasury bonds are sovereign bonds.
Unlike the bonds issued by developed nations, most emerging-market bonds
are dollar-denominated. Still, given the poverty, tsetse flies, and other prob-
lems of these nations, the governments can be shaky. To get enough people
to lend them money, they must pay high rates of interest. Very high. At the
time I’m writing this chapter, the Fidelity New Markets Income Fund has
enjoyed a five-year annualized return of just about 16 percent and a ten-year
annualized return of slightly over 12 percent. Woooahhh. Find that anywhere
else in a fixed-income investment.
Of course, with the high return, as always, comes high volatility. In 1998, when
Russian government bonds went into defaultski, investors in the Fidelity New
Markets Income Fund, like investors in most emerging-market funds, quickly
saw about a quarter of their investments disappear overnightski.
The following year, 1999, most emerging-market bond funds sprung back
rather nicely, even though Ecuador defaulted on its bonds that year. By the
way, certain dollar-denominated bonds issued by Latin American countries
are often referred to as Brady bonds, named after former U.S. Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady. The bonds were part of a scheme developed in the
late 1980s to figure out a way for Latin American countries to deal with their
giant-sombrero-sized debt burdens.
Should you invest?
I like emerging-market bonds, and I think they belong, in modest amounts, in
most portfolios larger than $100,000 or so. If you’re going to have high-yield
bonds in your portfolio, then emerging-market bonds make sense. When
recession hits the United States and the Dow and S&P have a rough year, U.S.
131
Chapter 9: Global Bonds and Other Seemingly Exotic Offerings

high-yield (junk) bonds usually tank. That makes sense. As companies hit
hard times, marginal companies are most likely to default. Emerging-market
bonds, however, have little correlation to the U.S. stock market. That’s why I
advocate a small allocation — perhaps 2 to 3 percent — of a well-diversified
portfolio in emerging-market bonds.
But, given the volatility of these bonds and the potentially high returns, I look
at them more like stock investments than bond investments; in fashioning port-
folios, I put emerging-market bonds on the equity side of the pie. There’s only
one practical way to invest in emerging-market bonds, and that is through a
mutual fund. I suggest some good fund options in Chapter 16.
Bond Investing with a Conscience
Whatever your religion, whatever your political leanings, there may be a
bond or bond fund out there waiting for you to express your beliefs. No one
ever said that making money has to be all about making money.
Having faith in church bonds
Talk about good deeds. Churches in the United States have issued bonds for
more than a century now. The bonds are most often secured by a deed of
trust on church real estate or other property. Traditionally, most of these
bonds have been sold as private offerings to bona fide members of the
church congregation only. But fairly recently, a market has been growing for
church bonds offered to the general public — believer and heathen alike.
What are they?
Church bonds look and feel something like corporate bonds, but they have a
certain advantage in that they are almost always backed by the issuer’s real
property. A leading broker for church bonds, Strongtower Financial of Fresno,
California, reports not a single default among the church bonds it has sold
since 1994. Not only that, but its church bonds have averaged slightly more
than a full percentage point higher yield during that time than investment-
grade (high quality) corporate bonds: about 8.5 percent versus 7.4 percent.
And if you care where your money is going, you’ll know that you’re helping to
fund the growth of a church, perhaps something that gives you emotional
comfort.
There are a few downsides to church bonds. First, church bonds tend to be
rather illiquid; you could have a hard time selling a church bond that you
don’t plan to hold to maturity. Second, all church bonds are callable, meaning
132
Part II: Numerous and Varied Ways to Make Money in Bonds 

that the church may give you your money back and retire the bond before it
matures. Third, church bonds are generally too small to be rated by the major
rating agencies, so you’ve really got to trust your broker to do due diligence
(that means homework in financial-speak) and make you an honest deal.
Should you invest?
Church bonds are viable alternatives to high-quality corporate bonds. But the
offerings are limited, and most are restricted to residents of certain states.
There is one church-bond mutual fund — Capstone Church Bond Fund
(XCBFX) — available to any investor in any state. Unfortunately, the yearly
management fee is too high for me to recommend this fund. Nonetheless, for
more information on this fund, contact Strongtower Financial at www.strong
towerfinancial.com or 1-888-378-6683. The Strongtower folks can also talk
to you about their individual church bond offerings, as well as church loan
funds (CLFs), which are pools of church bonds in which certain residents of
certain states may invest.
You may also try two other outfits devoted to the offering of church bonds:
 The American Church Mortgage Company at www.church-loans.net
or 1-800-815-1175
 The Great Nation Investment Corporation at www.churchbonds.net or
1-800-468-3007
If you shop for church bonds, don’t do it on a prayer; shop as you would for
any other bond. Get competitive bids, and make sure that you are not paying
an unreasonable markup to the broker. Know that church bonds are unrated
by the major rating agencies, so you’ll be depending more on your broker for
solid research and impartial advice than you would be when buying most
other bonds. Chapter 15 provides a list of commandments for dealing in indi-
vidual bonds of any faith.
Adhering to Islamic law: 
Introducing the sukuk
According to the classical laws of Islam, paying or charging interest is a defi-
nite no-no. You’d think, therefore, that bond investing would be as sinful as
slugging Jack Daniels while eating pork rinds and watching a swimsuit contest.
Well, it depends on the bond. Some very special bonds, called sukuk (pro-
nounced soo-cook), actually allow for virtuous investing . . . at least according
to some followers of Islam. Other followers see the sukuk as smoke and mir-
rors. But while the controversy continues, $17 billion in sukuk have been
133
Chapter 9: Global Bonds and Other Seemingly Exotic Offerings

issued in a recent nine-month period. Most are being issued in Islamic coun-
tries and sold to Middle Eastern and European investors. But sukuk sales in
the United States are now just beginning. In June 2006, Houston-based East
Cameron Partners, an oil development company, issued $166 million in sukuk.
Most of the buyers were U.S.-based hedge funds. They didn’t buy the sukuk for
religious reasons. These particular sukuk were paying 11.25 percent.
What are they?
Traditional bonds pay you a fixed interest amount over the life of the bond,
and then you get your principal back upon maturity. Sukuk also pay you a
fixed rate, but it isn’t called interest, and the money is said to come not from
the lending itself but rather from the sale or leasing of certain tangible assets,
such as property, equipment, or (in the case of East Cameron) oil profits.
In Islamic law, money is seen as having no real value in and of itself, explains
Yusuf DeLorenzo, a partner with Shariah Capital, a Connecticut-based finan-
cial product development firm specializing in Islamic offerings. “Income from
an investment has to have something real and substantial backing it up,” he
says. Hence the sukuk. Like a traditional bond, a sukuk has a maturity date
and a certain rate of return, but that rate of return may be either fixed or
floating and is always backed by some hard asset.
Should you invest?
There is as yet not much of a market for sukuk in the United States. But keep
your eyes and ears open. They may be coming. I (perhaps obviously) have no
direct experience with sukuk, so all I can say is to do a lot of research before
investing. If you are Islamic, you may want to check with your mullah to
ascertain whether a particular offering meets your religious needs. The Web
site of Shariah Capital, www.shariahcap.com, should bring regular updates
on the development of sukuk in this country, as well as abroad.
Investing for the common good: 
Socially responsible bonds
Socially responsible investing (SRI) can mean different things to different
people, but for most, the goal of SRI is to shun companies that produce
tobacco and alcohol, engage in gambling activities, produce lethal weapons,
pollute the environment, discriminate in employment, or violate human rights.
Instead of investing in such companies, SRI investors go to sleep at night know-
ing that their money is instead helping to fund companies working, more or
less, to create a better world with healthy products and practices.
134
Part II: Numerous and Varied Ways to Make Money in Bonds 

Most SRI investing is done through stock mutual funds. Steve Schueth, presi-
dent of First Affirmative Financial Network, a Colorado-based independent
advisory firm specializing in SRI, finds that somewhat ironic. “Doing social
action from the debt (bond), as opposed to the equity (stock) side of the
portfolio is potentially much more powerful,” he says.
Schueth points out that most stock transactions occur on the secondary
market. After the initial public offering of stock by a company, people gener-
ally don’t buy stock directly from the firm but rather from a third party
through an impersonal exchange. Not so with bonds. Bonds are much more
often purchased directly from the issuer. “As a lender of money, you actually
have considerable power to affect a company’s actions,” says Schueth. Of
course, he admits, only really big lenders have really big power. For the rest
of us, however, there are a handful of SRI bond mutual funds where we may
exert our influence in communal fashion.
What are they?
These mutual funds put companies through a social screen. Only those com-
panies that act in accordance with the social guidelines of the fund managers
get to sell their bonds to the fund. Examples of SRI bond funds include the
following:
 Calvert Social Investment Fund (CSIBX): www.calvertgroup.com or
1-800-368-2748
 Domini Social Bond Fund (DSBFX): www.domini.com or 1-800-582-6757
 PAX World High Yield Fund (PAXHX): www.paxworld.com or
1-800-372-7827
All three of these funds use somewhat similar social criteria. From the people
at PAX World:
Pax World offers mutual funds dedicated to promoting peace, protecting
the environment, advancing equality, and fostering sustainable develop-
ment. We seek to invest in companies that meet positive standards of cor-
porate responsibility and that provide products or services that improve
the quality of life. We avoid investing in companies that we determine are
significantly involved in the manufacture of weapons or weapons-related
products, that manufacture tobacco products, that are involved in gam-
bling as a main line of business, or that engage in unethical business
practices.
The somewhat similar Calvert and Domini funds consist of mostly higher
quality, intermediate-term bonds. The PAX fund, as the name implies,
includes bonds of lesser quality but potentially fatter returns.
135
Chapter 9: Global Bonds and Other Seemingly Exotic Offerings

Should you invest?
None of these funds is terrible; none (from a strictly financial viewpoint)
would likely make it to the top of my buy list. But there are things that matter
in life more than money, more than even some of the things that money can
buy, such as chocolate. If your values jive with those of the managers of these
funds, I would recommend that you consider these funds, carefully, for the
fixed-income side your portfolio. You could do a lot worse.
Playing with Bond Fire: Potentially
Risky Bond Offerings
When rock star David Bowie decided in 1997 to produce his own bonds using
his considerable talent (and future song royalties) as collateral, it struck
some as a rocking good idea. Bowie got $5.5 million out of the deal, but some
investors haven’t fared as well as they thought they would. In this section, I
introduce a few types of bonds that fall a few notes shy of being totally safe
investments but nonetheless may make a reasonable addition to some
people’s portfolios.
Rocking with Bowie Bonds
David Bowie was the first artist to issue bonds using his future royalties as
collateral. The bonds, issued in 1997, carried a coupon rate of 7.9 percent. Not
too shabby. But in 2004, given some changes in the music industry, including
the advent of file sharing on the Internet, Moody’s downgraded the bonds 
to junk status. The price of Ziggy Stardust’s bonds fell to earth. Those who
needed to sell lost a good deal. But the concept of Bowie bonds — raising
cash with talent — caught on nonetheless, and other artists soon followed.
What are they?
Since the original Bowie Bonds (sometimes called Pullman Bonds after David
Pullman, the financier who pulled the Bowie deal together), other artists
have followed suit. James Brown, The Isley Brothers, Iron Maiden, Ashford &
Simpson, and Rod Stewart have all closed similar deals, raising cash with
bonds backed by future song royalties. The music-makers get their money 
up front, and bondholders get to collect interest, they hope. Similarly, a few
small bond issues have been backed by future revenues of Hollywood film
sales and a handful of sporting events.
136
Part II: Numerous and Varied Ways to Make Money in Bonds 

Should you invest?
These are all very modest bond issues, rather illiquid (meaning that should
you wish to sell your bond, you may not be able to), and backed by assets of
wavering value. I wouldn’t go out of my way to purchase Bowie Bonds. Bond
manager Marilyn Cohen, a California-based colleague of mine who knows the
bond world inside and out, wisely suggests that if you do buy a Bowie-type
bond, at least try to find a rocker in the grave! That way you know he or she
is beyond scandal. Just imagine, says Cohen, what would likely have hap-
pened to the value of your investment if Michael Jackson had issued bonds
just prior to being accused of child molesting.
Cashing in on catastrophe bonds
Call it strange (I think it is), but in the past year about $10 billion has poured
into bonds that pay higher-than-market rates of interest, but only if the
weather cooperates.
What are they?
Known as catastrophe bonds, they are issued mostly by insurers, pay juicy
rates of return, and are backed by revenues from true moneymakers. That
may sound great, but here’s the catch: The issuer reserves the right to use
the cash behind the bonds if a hurricane or tsunami or tornado or earth-
quake results in many people suddenly making claims against the insurance
company. If the catastrophe results in massive claims, bondholders can wind
up seeing their principal cast into the wind.
Should you invest?
Are you kidding? A few extra dollars in possible interest in exchange for risk-
ing your principal? No way. That’s not what bonds are all about — or should
be about. These bonds may possibly make sense for institutional buyers with
huge resources but not for mere mortals like you and me, who hope to retire
someday and live on more than peanut butter sandwiches.
Dealing in death
If catastrophe bonds weren’t morbid enough, some of the world’s biggest insur-
ance companies have begun to issue death bonds. You stand to gain higher-
than-market rates of interest, but only if a certain number of people don’t die.
You read that right.
137
Chapter 9: Global Bonds and Other Seemingly Exotic Offerings

What are they?
These bonds are somewhat similar to catastrophe bonds. The bonds are
issued by insurers and pay raucous rates of interest, but the insurer reserves
the right to tap the money behind the bonds if more people than expected
die. Some of these bonds directly tie your return to the death rates of a pool
of the insured. If the insurance company’s customers eat their vegetables,
wear their seatbelts, and don’t play with guns, you win. If an epidemic strikes
or a volcano erupts, you lose, and your investment may turn to ash.
Should you invest?
Yuck. This investment is both risky and morbid. As with the catastrophe
bonds, there may be a reason for institutional investors to take a risk on 
such an investment. For living, breathing individuals, these bonds make little
to no sense.
Banzai Bonds: Hold on Tight
Whoooeeee! If you think of debt securities as safe and boring, cast a gander
on some of these investments. You could double or triple your money
overnight . . . or see it shrink and fade faster than the bankroll of a drunken
gambler in Vegas on a not-so-hot night.
Daring to delve into derivatives
In general, a derivative is a financial something-or-other whose value is based
on the price of some other financial something-or-other. (I apologize for the
highly technical definition.)
Examples of derivatives include futures and options. Entire fun books are writ-
ten on futures and options (such as Futures & Options For Dummies by Joe
Duarte, M.D., published by Wiley). Suffice to say that they allow you to lever-
age your money and make big play on just about anything, including the price
of pork bellies, orange juice, most stocks, and — yes — even “conservative-
investment” bonds, too. Another kind of derivative, specific to bonds, is
called the collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO).
What are they?
A CMO is a complicated beast created by a brokerage house. It is a certificate
that represents partial ownership of a huge pool of mortgage bonds, such as
Ginnie Maes, Fannie Maes, and Freddie Macs (see Chapter 7). Different
138
Part II: Numerous and Varied Ways to Make Money in Bonds 

owners in the pool get paid at different times, and the payments are contin-
gent on the performance of the pool and the payoff of other partial owners.
CMOs have a history of making fantastical profits for their creators but often
limited and frequently unpredictable returns for investors.
Futures and options allow investors to purchase a contract that says on such-
and-such a date, you’re going to buy (in the case of a future) or you have the
option of buying (in the case of an option) such-and-such a bond. The price is
set today, not knowing what the price of the bond will be at that date in the
future (the expiry date). If, on that day, the price of the bond is 110 and you
have a contract to buy it at 100, BINGO — you win! If, however, the price of
the bond has dropped to 95, ZINGO — you lose! Futures and options allow
you to put up relatively little money (the price of the contract) and possibly
profit a lot . . . or lose every penny.
Should you invest?
All derivatives are risky investments. In my mind, that’s not the purpose that
bonds serve in this universe. I wouldn’t suggest dabbling in either CMOs or
bond futures. Professional traders, who live-breathe-and-die this stuff, will
very likely clean your clock.
Banking on losses with 
defaulted bond issues
In Chapter 6, I talk about junk bonds: bonds that offer high yields but carry
high risk. Some bonds — bonds in default — are even junkier than junk.
What are they?
Bonds in default are almost always corporate bonds (very, very rarely munic-
ipal bonds). In default usually means that the company is bankrupt or very
close to being bankrupt, coupon payments on the bonds have stopped, and
there is an extremely high likelihood that investors’ principal — or a good
portion of principal — will never be returned.
But miracles do happen. Companies that seem to be going under or are forced
into reorganization sometimes make surprising comebacks. And when they 
do, or even if it looks like they might, big profits can ensue. Defaulted bonds
sell, as you would imagine, at very deep discounts. Those who purchased the
defaulted bonds of Delphi, the bankrupt auto parts producer, saw their invest-
ments double in price within several months. The defaulted bonds of Calpine,
the bankrupt energy company, quadrupled in value in a three-month period.
Many other (most) defaulted bonds, however, fade into oblivion, and investors
looking to make a quick buck are left with little to nothing to show.
139
Chapter 9: Global Bonds and Other Seemingly Exotic Offerings

Should you invest?
Hmmm. I spoke with Martin Fridson, CEO of FridsonVision LLC (an independ-
ent investment research firm in New York City) and something of an expert
on defaulted bonds. Here is what he says:
Buying a bond in default is the polar opposite of ordinary bond investing.
You get no income. No security. You’re purely speculating that the price
will shoot up and you’ll have a capital gain. Most people who buy these
never see any gain.
They [people who buy defaulted bonds] may have been talked into
buying the defaulted bond by a fast-talking broker, and that broker will
make a nice gain. But the person who bought the bond will generally see
nothing.
I’m inclined to agree. Play the horses . . . Roll some dice . . . Go to Spain and
bet on the bull to kill the matador . . . Buy defaulted bonds. Have fun, but
don’t call any of them investing. They are gambling.
Ah, but what if you are already holding a bond that goes into default? Should
you keep it or sell it? That depends, says Richard Lehmann, publisher of 
the Forbes/Lehmann Income Securities Investor newsletter (www.income
securities.com). If you’re holding a municipal bond, keep it, he says. The
recovery rate on munis is very high, in part because bondholders are usually
the only creditors.
If you’re holding a corporate bond that goes into default, that’s another story.
Banks and other creditors will tend to get their money before you do. Defaults
usually begin with an announcement from a company that it will cease coupon
payments on its bonds. Most often, such announcements come in November
or December for tax reasons, says Lehmann. As soon as the announcement is
made, the price of the bond will tumble as the market starts to panic.
After the initial panic, prices on defaulted corporate bonds usually, but not
always, creep up. If you can get your hands on a corporate balance sheet,
note what percentage of the company’s assets are intangibles, such as good-
will and brand names, says Lehmann. “The higher the percentage of intangi-
ble assets versus hard assets, the lesser your chance of recovery (getting
back any of your principal), and the more incentive you have to sell the bond
as soon as possible,” he says. “The greater the percentage of hard assets,
such as land and property, the greater your odds of recovery, and the more
incentive you have to hold onto the bond.”
Evaluating exchange-traded notes
They sound like exchange-traded funds (investments similar to indexed mutual
funds that trade like stocks), but exchange-traded notes (ETNs) are as different
140
Part II: Numerous and Varied Ways to Make Money in Bonds 

from ETFs as jellyfish are different from fish. ETNs are, in fact, debt instru-
ments, bonds of sorts, but the income they produce is far from fixed. In fact,
unlike most other debt securities, there is no coupon rate, and the maturity
date, although it exists, is rather inconsequential.
What are they?
ETNs were first issued in 2006 by Barclays, the same firm that issues many
ETFs. ETNs trade on the major exchanges, just like ETFs. You can buy as little
as one share (under $100), or many shares. But instead of buying a basket of
stocks or bonds, as you do when you buy a mutual fund or ETF, the purchase
of an ETN represents a direct loan to Barclays. If Barclays were ever to go
under, you could lose your money, just as you might if you were holding a
Barclays bond.
Instead of promising you a steady rate of interest on your loan, as you’d get
with a traditional bond, Barclays promises to pay you in accordance with the
performance of a particular index. So, for example, if you were to purchase
shares in the iPath Goldman Sachs Crude Oil Total Return Index (the ticker is
OIL), your return would be commensurate with any rise (or fall) in the price
of crude oil. If you were to purchase shares in the iPath Dow Jones-AIG
Commodity Index Total Return ETN (DJP), your returns would be commensu-
rate with the rise (or fall) in the value of an index that tracks a variety of com-
modities, from silver and gold to cotton futures and natural gas.
Barclays issues two general commodity index ETNs (DJP and GSP), the oil
ETN, and an ETN that tracks stocks on the Indian stock market (which has
the ticker INP). I believe that we’ll be seeing many more ETNs in the next few
years. At present, the IRS is taxing them very gingerly, asking only for capital
gains tax if profits result from a sale of shares. But the IRS is known to be
looking at ETNs with a magnifying glass, and the current favorable tax status
may not last forever.
Should you invest?
If you’re going to invest in commodities, including oil or Indian stocks,
Barclays ETNs make enormous sense. They are low-cost, tax-efficient (for the
moment) securities. They also are going to be highly volatile investments, so
be sure you know what you’re getting in to. These are not your father’s debt
instruments! Although Barclays is a very stable company with very little risk
of default, that is still a remote possibility. I suspect that other companies,
perhaps of lesser stability, will be issuing ETNs before long. Buyer beware.

But I don’t want you to look at bonds in a vacuum, so I 
discuss other kinds of investments as well.
Before you step into the kitchen to begin the actual 
portfolio-cooking process, your first step is to look at
investment risk and potential return: the yin and yang of
wealth-building. I introduce you to something called
Modern Portfolio Theory that explains how to balance
your yin and yang for maximum yield and minimal insom-
nia. I explain the concept of correlation and how you want
to incorporate into your portfolio some investments that
zig while others zag (and preferably a few that zog).
Finally, I serve as official matchmaker, matching you with
particular kinds of bonds that make sense for you — the
kinds of bonds with which you can live happily ever after.

Dear Russell: I am 8 years old. Some of my little friends say there is no
tradeoff between risk and return. Papa says, “If you see it in Bond Investing
For Dummies, it’s so.” Please tell me the truth: Is there a tradeoff between
risk and return?
VIRGINIA O’HANLON
115 WEST NINETY-FIFTH STREET
Yes, Virginia, there is a tradeoff between risk and return.
Your little friends are wrong. They have undoubtedly been thumbing through
too many paperback books in airport kiosks that say you can get rich quick
with absolutely no risk to your principal by following some crazy scheme or
another.
That is all fantasy, Virginia. In this great capitalist system of ours the individ-
ual investor is a mere insect, an ant, whose hope to get rich quick is fed by
the mass media and the greed of Wall Street and then squashed under the
heel of financial reality.
Alas! How dreary would be the world if there were no tradeoff between risk
and return. It would be as dreary as if there were no Virginias. You and your

Papa and all your little friends would simply invest in Treasury bonds and
retire rich tomorrow. Variable-annuity salesmen would be out on the street.
CNBC, instead of hyperventilating 24 hours a day over the stock market,
would be airing reruns of My Mother the Car.
Not believe in the tradeoff between risk and return?! You may as well not
believe in compound interest, or the miracle of modern orthodontics.
No tradeoff between risk and return?! A thousand years from now, Virginia,
nay, ten times ten thousand years from now, there will STILL be a tradeoff
between risk and return. This chapter explains why that is so, why under-
standing that tradeoff is integral to building a successful portfolio, and why
trying to do so without bonds is as silly as . . . well, questioning the existence
of Santa Claus.
Searching, Searching, Searching 
for the Elusive Free Lunch
Just in case you want to know the explanation, Virginia (Virgil, Vinny, Vicky. . .
whoever is reading this page), there is a tradeoff between risk and return for
roughly the same reason that a shiny new Lexus costs more than a 1993
Honda Civic. If both vehicles cost the same, everyone except maybe Ralph
Nader would buy a new Lexus. Similarly, if you thought you could earn as
much investing in Treasury bonds, backed by the U.S. government, as you
could earn investing in shiny tech stocks, backed only by the capriciousness
of the market, would you invest in the tech stocks? No, I don’t think so.
A risk-free investment that paid high returns would be the equivalent of a free
lunch. Sorry Charlie, but free lunches are very hard to find. No stable invest-
ment should be expected to pay a high rate of return. No luxury car should be
expected to sell for the same amount as an old jalopy. The capitalist market,
as Adam Smith once said (and even Ralph Nader can’t deny), has an invisible
hand.
Making a killing in Treasuries . . . 
yeah, right
What I’m saying, and what professor Smith was saying (sort of), is that risky
investments — or at least investments perceived as risky — tend to return
more than less risky investments for the very same reason that old jalopies
sell for less than new luxury cars: at least over the long run, they must.
146
Part III: Customizing and Optimizing Your Bond Portfolio 

Look: If you could invest in the stock market, commodities, real estate, or
Treasuries, all returns being equal, you’d invest in Treasuries, right?
Everyone would invest in Treasuries. There’d be no market for more volatile
investments. Similarly, if luxury cars and old jalopies were available at the
same price, there’d be no market for old jalopies.
Only because of differing rewards (higher return potential or greater price
bargain), there is a market for both. Honk honk. Ka-ching ka-ching.
Defining risk and return
In just a moment, I talk of the particular risk and return characteristics of
bonds. But first, I want to make clear what risk and return really are. (No, it
isn’t obvious to everyone.)
Risk is the potential of losing money. Although you can lose (or gain) money
a lot more easily in certain investments than others, there is some risk in all
investments . . . including bonds. When most people think of risk, they think
of wild market swings such as those that often occur in the market for, say,
cocoa bean futures. They think of how much money they could potentially
lose in a week, a month, or a year. But there are other ways to lose money in
an investment, which I address in the next section.
Return is the potential of making money. Most of the money made in bonds is
made in the form of interest payments. Sometimes, bonds also appreciate (or,
alas, depreciate) in value. Overall, the return potential of bonds is modest
compared to certain other investments, like an investment in the S&P 500 
or a dry-cleaning franchise in the local strip mall. As I make clear, I hope,
throughout this book, the benefit of bonds is more to temper risk and pro-
vide steady, predictable income than to capture huge gains.
Appreciating Bonds’ Risk Characteristics
In Chapter 9, I talk about bond derivatives, defaulted bonds, and a few other
bond investments that most people would consider wild and crazy by fixed-
income standards. But the vast majority of bond offerings are rather staid
investments. You give your money to a government or corporation. You
receive a steady flow of income, usually twice a year, for a certain number of
years. Then you get your original money back. Sometimes you pay taxes. A

Chapter 10: Risk, Return, and Realistic Expectations

Investing with confidence
The reason for bonds’ staid status is not only that they provide steady and
predictable streams of income, but also that as a bondholder you have first
dibs on the issuer’s money. A corporation is legally bound to pay you your
interest before it doles out any dividends to people who own company stock.
If a company starts to go through hard times, any proceeds from the business
or (in the case of an actual bankruptcy) from the sale of assets go to you
before they go to shareholders.
Realizing, however, that bonds 
offer no ironclad guarantees
First dibs on the money aside, bonds are not FDIC-insured savings accounts.
They are not without some risk. For that matter, even an FDIC-insured savings
account — even stuffing your money under the proverbial mattress! — also
carries some risk.
Following are seven risks inherent in bond investing. As a potential bond-
holder, you need to know each of them.
Interest-rate risk
Interest rates go up, and interest rates go down. And whenever they do, bond
prices move, almost in synch, in the opposite direction. Why? Because if you’re
holding a bond that is paying 5 percent, and interest rates move up so that
most new bonds are paying 7 percent, your old bond becomes about as desir-
able to hold as a pet scorpion. Any rational buyer of bonds would, all things
being equal, choose a new bond paying 7 percent rather than your relic, still
paying only 5 percent. Should you try to sell the bond, unless you can find a
real sucker, the price you are likely to get will be deeply discounted.
The longer off the maturity of the bond, the more its price will drop with
rising interest rates. Thus long-term bonds tend to be the most volatile of all
bonds. Think it through: If you have a bond paying 5 percent that matures in
a year, and the prevailing interest rate move up to 7 percent, you’re looking at
relatively inferior coupon payments for the next 12 months. If you’re holding
a 5 percent bond that matures in ten years, you’re looking at potentially ten
years of inferior coupon payments.
No one will want to buy a bond offering ten years of inferior coupon pay-
ments unless she can get that bond for a steal.
That is why if you try to sell a bond after a period of rising interest rates, you
take a loss. If you hold the bond to maturity, you can avoid that loss, but you
pay an opportunity cost because your money is tied up earning less than the
prevailing rate of interest. Either way, you lose.
148
Part III: Customizing and Optimizing Your Bond Portfolio 

Of course, interest-rate risk has its flip side: If interest rates fall, your existing
bonds, paying the older, higher interest rates, suddenly start looking awfully
good to potential buyers. They aren’t pet scorpions anymore — more like
Cocker Spaniel puppies. If you decide to sell, you’ll get a handsome price. 
(I discuss the formulation of bond prices in Chapter 4.)
Inflation risk
If you are holding a bond that is paying 4 percent, and the inflation rate is 
4 percent, you aren’t making anything. You are treading water. If your bond is
paying 4 percent, and inflation moves up to 5 percent, you are actually losing
money. Inflation risk is perhaps the most insidious kind of bond risk because
you can’t really see it. The coupon payments are coming in. Your principal is
seemingly intact. And yet, when all is said and done, it really isn’t intact. You
are slowly bleeding purchasing power.
Although inflation rarely hits you as fast and hard as rapidly rising interest
rates, it is the fixed-income investor’s greatest enemy over the long run.
Interest rates, after all, go up and down, up and down. But inflation moves in
only one direction. (Well, we could have deflation, where prices fall, but that
hasn’t happened since the Great Depression, and I don’t believe it is likely to
happen again anytime soon.) Inflation takes its toll slowly and steadily, and
many bondholders don’t even realize that they are losing ground.
Some bonds — Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities — are immune from
the risk of inflation. Most bonds (and bondholders), however, suffer when
inflation surges.
Reinvestment risk
When you invest $1,000 in, say, a 20-year bond paying 6 percent, you may be
counting on your money compounding every year. If that is the case — if
your money does compound, and you reinvest all your interest payments at 
6 percent — after 20 years you’ll have $3,262.
But suppose you invest $1,000 in a 20-year bond paying 6 percent and, after
four years, the bond is called. The bond issuer unceremoniously gives back
your principal, and you no longer hold the bond. Interest rates have dropped
in the past four years, and now the best you can do is to buy another bond
that pays 4 percent. Let’s suppose that you do just that, and you hold that
new bond for the remainder of the 20 years. Instead of $3,262, you are left
with $2,387 — about 27 percent less money.
The risk I describe here is called reinvestment risk, and it is a very real risk of
bond investing, especially when you buy callable or shorter-term individual
bonds. Of course, you can buy non-callable bonds and earn less interest, or
you can buy longer-term bonds and risk that interest rates will rise. Trade-
offs! Trade-offs! This is what investing is all about.
149
Chapter 10: Risk, Return, and Realistic Expectations

Note that one way of dealing with reinvestment risk is to treat periods of
declining interest rates as only temporary investment setbacks. What goes
down usually goes back up. As long as they don’t urgently need the cash,
long-term bondholders considering selling their bonds may wait for interest
rates to climb back up before going to market.
Default risk
This is the kind of risk that most people think of when they think of bond
risk. In fact, most bond investors worry so much about default risk that it
often blinds them to the more common and more insidious risks of bond
investing, such as those I mention in the previous sections.
What is default risk? Simple: The issuer of your bond starts to go under;
there’s no money left to pay creditors; and not only do your interest pay-
ments stop coming in the mail every six months, but you start to wonder if
you’ll ever get your principal back. If there’s actually a bankruptcy, your mail-
box, instead of offering you interest payments, will be flooded with letters
from lawyers explaining (in explicit Latin) that you are a sucker and a fool.
With Treasuries and agency bonds, this has never happened. Very, very rarely
do municipal bonds or investment-grade corporate bonds default. Default risk
is mostly an issue when you invest in high-yield (junk) bonds. When the econ-
omy is humming along, defaults are rare. When the economy slides and even
companies that make hotcakes can’t sell their wares, default rates jump. It’s
an especially nasty time to be losing money on your bonds because chances
are good that your other investments are doing poorly, as well.
There is also a relatively high risk of default in buying certain foreign bonds,
especially emerging-market bonds. But emerging-market bonds (bonds issued
mostly by the governments of poor countries), unlike U.S. junk corporate
bonds, have limited correlation to the U.S. stock market. For that reason,
although emerging-market bonds have somewhat higher volatility than U.S.
junk bonds, I often recommend them first for a portfolio (see Chapter 9).
Downgrade risk
Even if a bond doesn’t go into default, rumors of a potential default can send
a bond’s price into a spiral.
When a major rating agency, such as Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s, or Fitch,
changes the rating on a bond (moving it from, say, investment-grade to below
investment-grade), fewer investors want that bond. It is the equivalent of
Consumer Reports magazine pointing out that a particular brand of toaster
oven is prone to explode. Not good.
In 2005, for example, the major rating agencies downgraded both Ford 
and General Motors bonds from investment-grade to junk. Investors fled.
Bondholders saw their investment values drop by 20 to 30 percent. Many
150
Part III: Customizing and Optimizing Your Bond Portfolio 

cashed out, making the loss permanent. As it happens, Ford and GM bonds
both recouped somewhat, and, at least at the time of this writing, neither has
actually defaulted. Honk honk.
Bonds that are downgraded may be downgraded a notch, or two notches, 
or three. The price of the bond drops accordingly. Sometimes, downgraded
bonds are upgraded again. If and when that happens (it usually doesn’t),
prices can zoom right back up again. Holding tight, therefore, can sometimes
make good sense.
Tax risk
When comparing taxable bonds to other investments, such as stocks, some
investors forget to factor in the potentially high cost of taxation. Except for
municipal bonds and bonds kept in tax-advantaged accounts, such as an IRA,
the interest payments on bonds are generally taxable at your income-tax rate,
which for most people will be in the 25 to 28 percent range but could be as
high as 35 percent.
In contrast, stocks may pay dividends, most of which (thanks to favorable tax
treatment enacted into law just a few years back) are taxable at 15 percent. If
the price of the stock appreciates, that appreciation isn’t taxable at all unless
the stock is actually sold, at which point, it is usually taxed at 15 percent. So
would you rather have a stock that returns 5 percent a year or a bond that
returns 5 percent a year? From strictly a tax vantage point, bonds lose.
Paying even 25 percent tax represents a 67 percent bigger tax bite than
paying 15 percent.
Tax risk on bonds is most pronounced during times of high interest rates and
high inflation. If, for example, the inflation rate is 3 percent, and your bonds
are paying 3 percent, you are just about breaking even on your investment.
You have to pay taxes on the 3 percent interest, so you actually fall a bit
behind. But suppose that the inflation rate were 6 percent and your bonds
were paying 6 percent. You have to pay twice as much tax as if your interest
rate were 3 percent (and possibly even more than twice the tax, if your inter-
est payments bump you into a higher tax bracket), which means you fall even
further behind.
I don’t believe that inflation will go to 6 percent. But if it does, holders of con-
ventional (non-inflation-adjusted) bonds may not be happy campers, espe-
cially after April 15 rolls around.
Keeping-up-with-the-Joneses risk
Despite all the other risks I mention, bonds usually make good, safe invest-
ments. But the return on bonds generally isn’t going to be anything to write
home about. From a strictly financial point of view, that may not be so bad.
Some people who live within their means and already have good nest eggs
don’t need, and really should not take, much risk with their investments. But
151
Chapter 10: Risk, Return, and Realistic Expectations

if you’re not taking that risk and your neighbors are, and the markets are
good, and the economy is humming, your pesky neighbors may be making
much more on their investments than you are. Ouch.
Studies show that relative wealth (making more than your neighbors) is more
important to many people than absolute wealth (how much you actually have
in the bank). Can you handle dinner with your neighbors and friends as
between bites they boast about their major gains in the markets?
Regarding all these risks . . .
Please don’t think that I’m trying to convince you not to buy bonds! Despite
all the risks I mention, bonds still belong in your portfolio. Stay tuned for the
numerous reasons why.
And in the meantime, check out Figure 10-1. To the left, see where bonds tend
to fit into the investment-risk spectrum as compared to other kinds of invest-
ments. To the right and the far right, see where different kinds of bonds rank
in order of relative risk.

Chapter 10: Risk, Return, and Realistic Expectations
Understanding standard deviation
When comparing different kinds of bonds — or
any investments, for that matter — it helps 
to know the standard deviation. It is the most
oft-used measure of risk when comparing
investments.
What does it mean? An investment with a stan-
dard deviation of, say, 3 will give you a return
that is within one standard deviation (in this
case, 3 percentage points) of the mean about
two-thirds of the time. So suppose you have a
bond fund that has an historical average annual
return of 6 percent, and you know that the stan-
dard deviation is 3. What that means is that two-
thirds of the time, the return from this bond fund
will fall somewhere between 9 percent (6 per-
cent average return + 3 percent standard devi-
ation) and 3 percent (6 percent average return –
3 percent standard deviation). If that same bond
fund had a standard deviation of 5, the returns
you could expect would generally fall between
11 percent and 1 percent.
Is a high standard deviation good or bad? That
depends on how much volatility you can stom-
ach and how much return you need to get.
Thanks to Morningstar Principia software, I can
readily find the ten-year standard deviation for
any bond fund (which means how volatile the
funds have been for the past ten years).
Following are a few examples. The higher the
number, the greater the price swings in years
past and the greater the price swings, most
likely, in years to come. In the world of bonds, the
greatest factors affecting volatility are the matu-
rity of the bonds and the stability of interest rates.
The price of long-term bonds tends to be much
more volatile than the price of short-term bonds.
But the quality of the bonds matters, too. High-
yield (junk) bonds tend to be more volatile. And
foreign bonds, denominated in other currencies,
also tend to be more volatile due to currency flux.
To help put things in perspective, the ten-year
standard deviation for the stocks of the S&P
500, an index of the 500 largest companies in the
United States, stands at 15.36. As you can see,
only the most volatile of the volatile bonds are
as volatile as that. And the S&P 500 is consider-
ably less volatile than certain other investments,
such as tech stocks, small-company stocks,
and commodities.

Measuring risk a simpler way
An outfit called RiskMetrics offers a new, easier
way of comparing investment risk. Instead of
using standard deviation (the most common
way of measuring risk, as I explain in another
sidebar in this chapter), the folks at RiskMetrics
have come up with a scale that allows for much
simpler understanding of risk.
I recommend that you check out the free Web
site www.riskgrades.com. You plug in any
investment you wish — single bond, bond fund,
individual stock, stock fund — and voilà, you are
given a number. The higher the number, the
greater the risk. The lower the number, the lesser
the risk. Unlike standard deviation numbers,
RiskGrade numbers are logical and to scale (just
like the metric system of measuring distance 
or weight). In other words, an investment with 
a RiskGrade of 20 is twice as volatile as an
investment with a RiskGrade of 10 and half as
volatile as an investment with a RiskGrade of 40.
RiskGrades take into consideration various
kinds of risk, including interest-rate risk, cur-
rency fluctuation, and default risk. Theoretically,
at least, the RiskGrades methodology could
prove to be a truer measure of future risk than
the always backwards-looking standard devia-
tion. Check with me in about 25 years, and I’ll
have the definitive answer! In the meantime,
you may wish to compare and contrast the two
measures, and take them both into considera-
tion when choosing a bond category.
Following are the same bond funds that I give
standard deviations for in the “Understanding
standard deviation” sidebar. As a point of com-
parison, the RiskGrade for the S&P 500 is 65.

The RiskGrades Web site not only allows you to
ascertain the relative risk of various invest-
ments; it also pumps out a risk rating for your
entire portfolio. The cumulative risk rating of all
your investments will be lower than the average
of all the individual RiskGrades, illustrating the
risk-reducing power of diversification.

Reckoning on the Return 
You’ll Most Likely See
If all bonds were the same, this would be a very short book indeed. Bonds
differ greatly as far as risk, expected return, taxability, sensitivity to various
economic conditions, and other factors. Up until now, this chapter has focused
more on risk than on expected return. (Yes, Virginia, I do believe that I already
mentioned there’s something of a connection between the two!) I now discuss
expected returns.
I can hear you say with confidence, “But a bond yielding 5 percent can be
expected to return 5 percent over the life of the bond, and a bond yielding 
6 percent can be expected to yield 6 percent. How hard can this be?”
HA! Ha ha ha ha!
Calculating fixed-income returns 
is much easier said than done
So you invest in a $1,000 bond that yields 6 percent and matures in 20 years.
What do you do with the $30 coupon payments that you receive every six
months? Do you reinvest them or spend them on Chinese dinners? Do you
keep the bond for the entire 20 years or cash it out beforehand? (If the bond
is callable, of course, you may have no choice but to take back your principal
before maturity.) And if you do cash out before maturity, what kind of price
will you be able to get for the bond?
And what about real (after-inflation) rate of return — the return that really
matters? If inflation runs at 2 percent, your real return will be a lot greater
than if inflation runs at 8 percent. But how can future inflation be predicted?
And what if you invest in a bond fund? Just because the fund yielded, say, 5
percent annually over the past seven years, does that mean it will yield that
much moving forward?
And (sorry, just a couple more questions here . . . I’m almost done) what
about after-tax real return (return after both inflation and taxes)? Ultimately,
that’s the return that matters the most of all. That’s the return that moves
you ahead financially or sets you back. Do you know what your tax bracket
will be in ten years? Do you know what anyone’s tax bracket will be in ten
years?
155
Chapter 10: Risk, Return, and Realistic Expectations

These are just some of the questions that make bond investing — or any kind
of investing — so much fun! I now pull out my crystal ball.
Looking back at history is an 
imperfect guide, but . . .
Not to beat a dead horse or anything, but I said something earlier about the
markets pretty much assuring that in the long term investors are appropri-
ately rewarded for the risks they take. And so it stands to reason that if we
know what kind of returns a certain kind of bond has seen in the past, oh, 30
years, it may give us a pretty good indication of the kind of returns that kind
of bond is likely to provide in the next 30 or so years. Granted, history is only
a guide. (Repeat: History is only a guide.) But aside from tea leaves and Tarot
cards (which I don’t put a whole lot of faith in), history is one of the only
guides we have.
I’ve nabbed a few charts from Vanguard that show nominal (before inflation)
bond returns over the past 30 years. You’ll note that the past 30 years have
been particularly good ones for government bonds, which, despite their
lesser risk, have returned almost as much as corporate bonds.

Okay, so much for the past 30 years. Now I invite you to look at bond returns
over an even longer period.
As it happens, we have pretty good data about bond returns over the past 
80 years, largely thanks to Ibbotson Associates, a Morningstar company. Here
are the figures for the average annual nominal (before inflation) return of
three categories of bonds for the period 1926 to 2006:
 One-month Treasury bills: 3.7 percent
 Long-term government bonds: 5.5 percent
 Long-term corporate bonds: 5.9 percent
And here are those same figures translated into real (after inflation) returns
for the same time period:
 One-month Treasury bills: 0.6 percent
 Long-term government bonds: 2.4 percent
 Long-term corporate bonds: 2.8 percent
Um, I suppose as the author of Bond Investing For Dummies I’m not supposed
to point this out, but quite honestly, the numbers aren’t too awe-inspiring, are
they? Keep in mind that they don’t even factor in taxes, and you are taxed on
the nominal (pre-inflation) returns of your bonds, not the real (post-inflation)
rate of return.

Chapter 10: Risk, Return, and Realistic Expectations

Investing in bonds despite 
their lackluster returns
So what would you have earned, after taxes, investing in long-term govern-
ment bonds over the past 80 years? Well, compared to stocks, which have
returned about 10 percent a year before inflation and 7 percent after inflation,
you would have earned squat. With corporate bonds, you would have earned
slightly more than squat. And with short-term government bonds, you would
have earned less than squat.
Keep in mind that all squat figures are rough approximations only. If you
force me to get technical, the long-term return on all bonds, judging by the
past 80 years, is about half that of all stocks. The real return on bonds (after
inflation but before taxes) is about one-third that of stocks. For the average
taxpayer, the after-tax, long-term return on bonds is very roughly one-quarter
that of stocks. (I told you this wasn’t a book on getting rich quick!)
So why even bother to invest in bonds? There are still several very good 
reasons:
 Even squat adds up when compounded year after year. Start with
$10,000. Give yourself a mere 2 percent annual return, and — voilà —
within a century, you’ll have $72,450. Granted, you’re not going to live
another century unless you’re from extremely good stock and you’re
reading this in diapers, but you get the point, right?
 In the last 80 years, stocks clearly clobbered bonds, but the next 80
years could be entirely different. Data from the 1800s show that the
returns of stocks and bonds weren’t all that different way back when.
 Investment-quality bonds have little — practically no — correlation to
stocks, so they provide excellent balance to a portfolio. If you want to
make sure that you’re holding investments that don’t all crash at once,
stocks and bonds are a sweet mix to have.
 At certain times when stocks have tanked, bonds (especially long-term
Treasury and high-quality corporate bonds) have rallied, providing com-
fort to investors when comfort was most needed. See Figure 10-8.
 Unlike just about any other kind of investment, bonds provide steady
income for people who need it.
 Bonds’ limited volatility, as compared to many other investments, makes
them good bets for people who can’t afford to take much short-term risk.
 Even though bonds have earned squat compared to stocks, they are 
virtual money machines compared to keeping your money in a savings
account or money market fund. Passbook savings accounts and money

market funds are generally not going to pay you enough to even keep up
with inflation.
 Because you are going to take my advice on regularly rebalancing your
portfolio (see Chapter 12), the “drag” of bonds on total portfolio perfor-
mance will likely be much less than you think.

Finding Your Risk–Return Sweet Spot
Portfolio A is as volatile as a three-year-old child but offers high return poten-
tial. Portfolio B is as volatile as a three-toed sloth (it hangs in trees) and
offers modest return potential. Portfolio C is halfway between the two.
Without knowing anything else about these three hypothetical portfolios, I’d
say that Portfolio A is made up mostly of stocks; Portfolio B is constructed
mostly of bonds; and Portfolio C is a more even mixture of both.
Allocating your portfolio correctly
Deciding how to split your portfolio between fixed income (bonds, cash, CDs)
and equity (stocks, real estate) is usually going to affect your risk–return pro-
file more than any other decision. For that reason, I have an entire chapter —
Chapter 12 — designed to help you make that one crucial decision. Do you
want a 70/25/5 (stocks/bonds/cash) portfolio? A 50/45/5 portfolio? A 30/55/15
portfolio? Silly formulas abound. I want you to get it right . . . which you will.

Chapter 10: Risk, Return, and Realistic Expectations

But certainly, what kind of equity (large-company stocks, small-company
stocks, foreign stocks, dry-cleaning franchise) and what kind of fixed income
(Treasuries, corporate bonds, junk bonds, munis) you choose for your port-
folio will play very much into your risk–return profile as well. In Chapter 13, 
I ask you to tell me something about yourself so I can help you decide what
kinds of bonds are best for you. For now, I want you to start thinking about
your risk–return “sweet spot.”
Tailoring a portfolio just for you
Your age, your income, your wealth, your expenses, your retirement plans,
your estimated Social Security, and your health all come into play when
deciding where your risk–return sweet spot should fall.
As far as choosing your bonds, the less volatile bonds (short-term, high qual-
ity) will naturally edge your portfolio toward safety but more modest returns.
The higher volatility bonds (long-term, high-yield) will move your portfolio
toward greater risk but potentially higher return. (Ask Virginia O’Hanlon if
this isn’t self-evident; she can explain it.)
Ah, but there are times when choosing even a very volatile bond or bond
fund may make perfect sense, even for someone looking to avoid risk. You’ll
understand why after reading about Modern Portfolio Theory, which tells us
that new investments added to a portfolio must take into consideration exist-
ing investments within the portfolio. It’s not as complicated as it sounds.
Honest! Read all about Modern Portfolio Theory in the next chapter.

P
eople sometimes ask me, “Russell, is such-and-such a good investment?”
My response is always the same: “It depends largely on what other
investments you have in your current portfolio.” Wishy-washy? Nah.
Some investments are so horrible that no one should ever touch them. (Your
brother-in-law will be happy to recommend several to you, I’m sure. If he
can’t, mine will!) Somewhere, I suppose, there may be an investment so per-
fect that anyone who doesn’t jump on it is a fool. (I’ve never seen such an
investment, but presumably there is one somewhere.) Most investments are
neither horrible nor perfect; they may be good for you but not good for me,
or vice versa.

Take John Hypothetical Investor, whose entire portfolio consists of bonds in
the ChickenLickin’ Corporation. John needs yet another ChickenLickin’ bond
about as badly as I need water in my basement. But just because another
ChickenLickin’ bond isn’t right for John doesn’t make it a fixed-income
pariah. Such a bond may be just the perfect addition to the portfolio of Jane
Hypothetical Investor, whose present wealth consists of a few randomly
chosen tech stocks and a dozen mayonnaise jars filled with pennies.
Starting with the next chapter, I explain the mechanics of building a portfolio,
including which kinds of bonds may fit in best and how to go about buying
and selling them. But before we get there, I need to discuss a few of the theo-
retical underpinnings that can help you understand how intelligent portfolios
are constructed. In this chapter, I explain some of the modern science that
allows smart investors, like you, to construct the leanest and meanest portfo-
lios possible — portfolios that minimize risk and maximize potential return.
What do such portfolios look like? Here’s a hint: Bonds, be they ChickenLicken
or any other variety, are an essential ingredient.
Mixing and Matching Your 
Various Investments
So, what kinds of investments go well together, and which kinds clash?
If you already have a portfolio that looks like John Hypothetical Investor’s —
a portfolio filled with ChickenLickin’ bonds — the last thing you need is
another ChickenLickin’ bond. That’s because putting all your eggs in one
basket is the surest way to wind up with scrambled eggs (or fried chickens).
You want to include different kinds of investments in any portfolio, preferably
investments from different asset classes and, best of all, investments that
have little or no correlation.
Dreaming of limited correlation
An asset class is a group of investments that share common characteristics.
Long-term, investment-grade corporate bonds would be an example. Small
cap growth stocks would be another example. United States–based real
estate investment trusts (REITs) would be a third.
For a good, basic education on asset-class investing and why it makes so
much sense, I highly recommend two books:
164
Part III: Customizing and Optimizing Your Bond Portfolio 

 All About Asset Allocation by Richard Ferri (McGraw-Hill)
 The Intelligent Asset Allocator by William Bernstein (McGraw-Hill)
One distinguishing characteristic of an asset class is that it tends to perform
in cycles, and those performance cycles tend to be different than the perfor-
mance cycles of other asset classes. In other words, two distinct asset
classes will have limited correlation: They won’t move up and down at the
same time. And so, having them together in a portfolio helps make for
smoother sailing.
Let me illustrate how lack of correlation works to lessen a portfolio’s ups and
downs. Figure 11-1 shows the performance of two investments, which we’ll
call “Volatile Investment A” and “Volatile Investment B.” Both investments
offer high returns and equally high volatility; they move up and down like
pogo sticks under a hyperactive child. However, notice that they don’t move
up and down at the same time. In fact, these two investments move in oppo-
site directions. They are said to have negative correlation.
Because of that negative correlation (easy to find in textbooks, very difficult
to find in the real world), Volatile Investment A and Volatile Investment B
combine to create a portfolio with socko returns but not a wee bit of volatil-
ity. Figure 11-2 shows what happens when you put them together into the
same portfolio: You get the perfect result of high returns and no price swings!
Unfortunately, this is only a model. Finding two high-returning investments
with negative correlation is almost impossible in the real world.

Chapter 11: The Science (and Pseudoscience) of Portfolio-Building

Seeking zig and zag
What I’m talking about is diversification: combining an investment that zigs
with another that zags, and possibly a third that zogs. In the investment
realm, diversification is your very best friend.
Most investment pros are familiar with something called Modern Portfolio
Theory. You should be, too. Modern Portfolio Theory is the key to maximizing
return with minimal risk. What the theory says is that if you combine asset
classes that zig and zag (and possibly zog) in a portfolio, even though each
asset class by itself may be quite volatile, the volatility of the entire portfolio
can be quite low. In fact, in some cases, you can add a volatile investment to
a portfolio and, as long as that investment shows little correlation to every-
thing else, you may actually lessen the volatility of the entire portfolio!
Translating theory into reality
Correlation is measured on a scale of –1 to 1. Two investments with a correla-
tion of 1 are perfectly correlated: They move up and down in synch, like two
Rockettes. Two investments with a correlation of –1 have perfect negative cor-
relation: When one goes up, the other goes down, like pistons. A correlation of
zero means that there is no correlation between two investments: When one
goes up, the other may go up or down; there’s simply no predicting.
In the real world, negative correlations of two productive investments are
hard to find, but you can find investments that have close to zero correlation.
Perhaps the best example from history is stocks and bonds. Bonds as a whole
generally move up and down independent of stock prices. Some bonds —
such as long-term Treasuries — tend to have slightly negative correlation to
stocks, generally climbing during times of recession (often in response to

dropping interest rates). But other bonds, such as U.S. high-yield bonds, tend
to move more in synch with the stock market.
When choosing a bond or bond fund, you always want to consider the corre-
lation that your new investment is going to have with your existing invest-
ments. High-yield bonds may throw off considerably more interest than
Treasuries, but they aren’t going to give you nearly the same diversification
power if your portfolio is made up mostly of U.S. stocks.
In Figure 11-3, you can see how the performance of the entire bond market
(as reflected in the share price of the Vanguard Total Bond Market Index
Fund) and the performance of stocks (as reflected in the share price of the
Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund) exhibit little correlation. Sometimes
they go up together and sometimes down together, but often they move in
opposite directions.
Appreciating Bonds’ Dual Role:
Diversifier and Ultimate Safety Net
Okay, okay, so diversification is a good thing, but why must a diversified port-
folio include bonds? After all, there are many, many investments to choose
from in this world.

Chapter 11: The Science (and Pseudoscience) of Portfolio-Building

True enough: There are many investments to choose from in this world. And I
encourage you, if your portfolio is large enough, to do some gonzo investing,
as I like to call it. Go ahead, invest in commodities and foreign real-estate
funds and emerging-market stocks and stocks in small value international
companies and hedge funds and emerging-market debt. All these asset
classes are imperfectly correlated, so you will likely get extra return while
shaving off some volatility.
But invest with caution. Even when you use sophisticated portfolio-building
tools to take maximum advantage of Modern Portfolio Theory, diversification
isn’t foolproof. It’s no guarantee that you won’t lose money.
Sometimes, even historically non-correlated asset classes can move in the
same direction. We’re seeing more examples of increased correlation these
days. Thank globalization, which has tied many markets together. Thank
hedge funds and certain mutual funds, which have taken previously obscure
asset classes, such as coffee-bean futures, and turned them into frequently
traded investments.
Protecting yourself from perfect storms
Lately, the markets have seen several perfect storms: times when all the eco-
nomic conditions are lined up in such a fashion that practically everything
everywhere loses money. You may recall a few very ugly days on the markets
in late February and early March 2007.
Tuesday, February 28, 2007 was one of the worst days the market has ever
seen. (I hope that is still true when this book appears in print!) As reported in
The Wall Street Journal on March 1, 2007, “Tuesday’s market drop left few
financial assets unscathed. Not only did all 30 stocks of the Dow Industrial
Average fall, so did all but two of the stocks in the Standard & Poor’s 500-
stock index. Of 51 country stock markets followed by MSCI Barra indexes,
only two — Jordan and Morocco — didn’t fall. Emerging-market and junk-
bond prices fell sharply. Even the price of gold, where investors typically run
in times of trouble, fell. Treasuries, another haven in times of peril, did rise.”
Thank goodness Treasuries and other high-quality bonds are available to pro-
vide your portfolio with some kind of cushion!
Eyeing a centuries-old track record
Not only do high-quality bonds, such as Treasuries, have a proven track
record of slightly negative correlation to the stock market, but they also have
a long history of stability and positive returns. So they provide two vital roles
168
Part III: Customizing and Optimizing Your Bond Portfolio 

in a portfolio: diversification, and (just in case diversification doesn’t work) a
solid floor that will keep your portfolio from falling too far in hard times.
You can’t say that about many other asset classes:
 Foreign stocks? With the globalization of markets, foreign stocks,
although they still offer somewhat limited correlation to U.S. markets,
are beginning to have less diversification power. And foreign stocks, like
all stocks, can be very volatile, especially with currency fluctuations.
 Gold? The precious metal, a hedge against stock market gyrations for
generations, has lately lost some its diversifying glimmer. Lately, for a
number of reasons, gold has moved in synch with the stock market more
often than not. It is also unclear whether gold, silver, oil, or any other
nonproductive commodity is going to produce gains in the long run.
Over the past 100 years, the price of gold has risen just about the same
as the rate of inflation.
 Hedge funds? They are expensive. Terribly expensive. They are opaque
(it’s 11:00 p.m. — do you know where your money is?). They are volatile.
They are illiquid (meaning it’s sometimes hard to unload your shares).
They may or may not give you the diversification you seek.
 Cash? Nothing in the short run is as safe as cash. The price of cash is,
well, the price of cash! But over the long run, cash is inevitably eaten up
by inflation. Keep too much of your portfolio in cash, and you are taking
a real risk of losing purchasing power over time.
On the other hand, quality bonds — Treasuries, agencies, and investment-
grade corporate bonds — seem to have lost none of their diversifying power.
Plus, they earn enough return to stay ahead of inflation, and they are stable.
In fact, because bonds offer a steady stream of income, which tends to offset
any price depreciation, and because those bond payments are not contingent
on company profits (as are stock dividends), quality bonds very rarely lose
money. Occasionally, when interest rates rise, long-term investment-quality
bonds may lose value for a year or two. By year three, however, you are virtu-
ally assured of at least breaking even.
Recognizing Voodoo Science
Although Modern Portfolio Theory has its limitations, the science behind the
theory is sound, and its real-world applications are profound. The same
cannot be said for other common theories on investing. Now is as good a
time as any for me to blow a couple of these common deceits out of the
water.
169
Chapter 11: The Science (and Pseudoscience) of Portfolio-Building

Here’s deceit number one: Timing the markets, finding “hidden” bond deals,
and predicting changes in interest rates are the ways to manage a bond port-
folio. And deceit number two: Successful buying and selling of bonds can
boost your portfolio yields considerably.
Comparing actively managed
funds to index funds
The Morgan Stanley High Yield Securities mutual fund’s latest prospectus
explains that the fund’s managers, in choosing bonds for the fund, consider
“economic developments, rate trends, and other factors it deems relevant.”
The prospectus goes on to explain that the esteemed fund managers use a
slew of very sophisticated and complicated investment strategies — includ-
ing options, futures, swaps, inverse floaters, and forward foreign currency
exchange contracts — to manage the bond portfolio.
The prospectus is downright intimidating, even to someone like me who
knows an awful lot about bonds. How can anyone read this prospectus and
fail to be dazzled?
Keep reading. And stop being dazzled.
The Morgan Stanley High Yield Securities fund, C Shares (C shares means you
pay a load or commission when you sell the fund), as of the end of 2006,
boasts a ten-year annual return of –2.78 percent. That’s a full 3.96 percent
lower than the ten-year annualized return for the Lehman Brothers Aggregate
Bond Index, a popular index that estimates the return of all bonds in the
United States. And it is a full 6.36 percent lower than the ten-year annualized
return for the Credit Suisse High Yield index, an index of high-yield bonds in
the United States.
According to Morningstar, the Morgan Stanley High Yield fund is one of more
than 85 percent of actively managed bond mutual funds that failed to beat the
Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index over the past ten years.
Forecasting the future — 
and getting it wrong
So few actively managed bond funds succeed at beating the index because
timing markets, predicting changes in interest rates, and finding “hidden”
bond deals are very, very hard things to pull off. Even the highly educated
and handsomely paid managers who run the nation’s largest bond funds con-
sistently fail to do it.
170
Part III: Customizing and Optimizing Your Bond Portfolio 

Just as is the case in the stock market, bond markets tend to be efficient.
Because there are so many investors out there, all looking for a good deal,
good deals are very, very hard to find.
Fund managers who spend hours and hours poring over company documents
(so-called fundamental analysis) to find “hidden” deals usually fail to beat the
market. Those who read charts that show the price of bonds going up and
down and try to predict their future direction (so-called technical analysis)
usually fail to beat the market. Those who read The Wall Street Journal every
day and can list all the leading economic indicators, from employment figures
to the latest on the trade deficit, usually fail to beat the market.
Those few mutual fund managers who succeed at beating the market often
succeed to such a small degree that they typically don’t add enough value to
offset their high fees and the many costs of constant trading.
Of course, most people buy into the belief that investment professionals,
including bond mutual fund managers and bond brokers, know what they are
doing — and can pull off miracles. Millions and millions are spent on adver-
tising each year so that people continue to believe. And yet year after year,
those who buy and hold index funds — funds that simply track stock or bond
indexes and charge little in fees — come out ahead.
Ignoring the hype
I’m not saying that a good bond broker or bond mutual fund manager can’t
be an asset to you. There are a handful of good bond mutual fund managers
out there, and I’ve occasionally invested in their funds.
There are also good bond brokers, to be sure, who can help structure a port-
folio, build good bond ladders for regular income, and help you gauge a
proper level of risk for your investments. But please don’t believe the broker
who says that he is privy to information that will help you score big in the
bond world. Such inside scoops, legally or illegally obtained, are extremely
rare.
Beware especially of the bond broker who pats herself on the back for never
having sold you a bond that went into default. No Treasury or agency bond
has ever defaulted. Defaults among municipal bonds are as uncommon as
penguins in the Caribbean. And defaults in the corporate bond universe are
easy to avoid if you select top-rated quality bonds.
171
Chapter 11: The Science (and Pseudoscience) of Portfolio-Building

Bonds are ballast to a portfolio; they aren’t meant to make a killing. How to
pick the best individual bonds is the subject of Chapter 15. How to pick the
best bond funds is covered in Chapter 16. None of it is magic. None requires
secret decoder rings. The best bonds are bought with common sense, frugal-
ity, and the knowledge that no bond is an island.

A
s a teenager, I had a boat. It was 15 feet from bow to stern, yellow with
two white vinyl bucket seats up front and a small bench in the back. I
kept it behind my home on Long Island, tied to a floating dock in an inlet that
led to the Atlantic Ocean. It was propelled (if you can even use that word) by
a 25-horsepower engine. The boat, when it had the currents running against
it, moved at a snail’s pace. When I had three passengers in the boat, it was
lucky to move at all.
Mind you, I am not looking for sympathy. I know darned well that other kids
growing up had to deal with much, much tougher things in life, but this
alleged power boat would lose a race to a paddle boat. Sometimes the other
teenage boys on the water would throttle their engines, do vicious circles
around me, point in my direction, and scream “Slooow down, Russell!” while
laughing themselves sick.
My father, you see, bought that boat from an elderly gentleman who used it
for lake fishing. Dad purposely wanted a boat with little horsepower because
he figured the severely limited speed might keep his son safe. Dad’s motiva-
tion was good, but his reasoning wasn’t so good. A boat that size with a 25-
horsepower engine may be perfect for lake fishing, but out in the ocean it was
something of a floating deathtrap, prey to strong currents and the wakes of
behemoth yachts.

After such a wake blew me into the side of a concrete bridge and cracked the
hull, I was finally able to convince my father to up the horsepower a bit . . .
for safety’s sake. I wasn’t exactly going vroom vroom with my new 35-horse-
power engine, but I ceased having to listen to “Slooow down, Russell!” from
my boating schoolmates. And that felt awfully good.
Funny how some things never change. Many years later, I would become an
investment advisor. And my Dad, by then retired from years as a New York
City attorney, was living (along with my Mom) off a portfolio of mostly bonds
and CDs. It took some doing, but I was finally able to convince them to “up
the horsepower” of the portfolio by adding some stocks. Like many retirees
I’ve worked with, especially those who lived through the Great Depression,
my parents had the notion that bonds and other slow and steady fixed-
income investments, such as bank CDs, mean safety.
True, a bond portfolio, unlike a stock portfolio, tends to move at a steady
pace. But as with an underpowered boat in a large ocean, lack of horsepower
can be as dangerous as too much horsepower. Bond portfolios lack volatility,
but they are easy prey to the currents of the economy and the tides of infla-
tion. The truly safest portfolios, as we’ve seen in both the Great Depression
and the hyperinflation of the 1980s, have both the horsepower of stocks and
the stability of bonds.
Ah, but how much horsepower and how much stability? How do you find that
perfect blend? Well, that depends on whether, investment-wise, you are an
elderly lake fisherman, a youngster with a hankering for speed, a retired
attorney and his wife, or a yachtsman leaving a big wake. In this chapter I ask
you some questions about your life and, by examining your answers, help
you determine just the proper allocation of bonds for your portfolio. In other
words, I help to find just the right vroom-vroom/slooow-down ratio.
Why the Bond Percentage Question 
Is Not As Simple As Pie
I may as well cut right to the chase. Here’s how to figure out what percent of
your portfolio should be in bonds, in Seven Easy Steps. Simply pull out a
blank piece of paper, and pencil in the appropriate numbers. Ready?
1. Start with the number 100.
100
2. Subtract your current age from 100.
___
3. Divide line 2 by the number of years between now and retirement.
___
174
Part III: Customizing and Optimizing Your Bond Portfolio 

4. Do you have a pension? If so, add 5.
___
5. Does your boss have freckles? If so, subtract 3.
___
6. Do you have a cousin named Pablo? If so, subtract 6.
___
7. Add the number of feet between you and the closest garbage can.
___
All done? Good! Now wad up the piece of paper and see if you can sink a
three-pointer in the basket.
My point?
There are no simple formulas.
A 28-year-old with $2,800 in savings should not be investing his money the
same as a 56-year-old with $620,000 in savings. A 67-year-old with a $500,000
nest egg and no pension will want to invest very differently from a 67-year-old
with the same nest egg but a generous pension. A gazillionaire with spouse
and kids and a desire to leave half a gigillion to charity may want to invest dif-
ferently than a gazillionaire whose greatest interest is throwing big parties in
Morocco with dozens of camels in drag. These are only some of the factors
ignored by simplistic formulas.
They will not be ignored in this chapter!
Minimizing volatility
If I may recap very, very briefly what I say about bond returns in Chapter 10:
The long-term return on all bonds, judging by the past 80 years, is about half
that of all stocks. The real return on bonds (after inflation but before taxes) is
about a third that of stocks. For the average taxpayer, the after-tax, long-term
return on bonds is roughly a quarter that of stocks. So what percent of your
portfolio do you want in bonds? If there were an easy formula, it would be
this:
Ideal percent of your portfolio in bonds = The necessary amount — and no
more (or less, for that matter)
The “no more” part, in my book (hey! — this is my book!), is the easier part of
the formula. The answer is 75 percent. No kidding. Except perhaps in very
rare circumstances, no one needs or wants a portfolio that is more than 75
percent bonds. Why? Because stocks and bonds together provide diversifica-
tion. With all bonds and no stocks, you lack diversification. Diversification
smoothes out a portfolio’s returns.

Chapter 12: Dividing Up the Pie: What Percentage Should Be in Bonds?

Believe it or not, even though stocks are much more volatile than bonds 
(see Figure 12-1), a modest percent of stocks added to a portfolio of mostly
bonds can actually help lower the volatility of the portfolio. (I discuss this
when I explain Modern Portfolio Theory in Chapter 11.) To include less than
that (or more than 75 percent bonds) raises volatility and lowers the odds of
favorable returns both over the short run and long run. So why would anyone
ever want to go there? Unless you have good reason to expect an economic
apocalypse anytime soon (you don’t), it doesn’t make a whole lot of sense to
invest only in bonds.
Maximizing return
The highest returning portfolios over the past few decades — over any few
decades, for that matter — are made up of predominantly stocks. But those
are also the portfolios that go up and down in value like popcorn on a fire. So
the question “How much do you need in bonds?” is really a question, in good
part, of how much short-term volatility you can or should tolerate.

How much volatility you can or should stomach, in turn, becomes largely a
factor of time frame: Are you investing for tomorrow? Next year? A decade
from now? Five decades from now? If you run an endowment fund, or if you
happen to be immortal, your time frame may be infinite. For most of us
human-being types, there will come a time when we want to tap into our trea-
sured nest egg. But when?
To compare the volatility of bonds versus stocks, take a look at Figure 12-2.
Bonds’ long-term gains pale in comparison to stocks, but when things get
rough, bonds don’t take it on the chin as stocks do. The figure shows the best
and worst returns for stocks and bonds (as measured by the S&P 500 Index
and the Lehman Brothers U.S. Aggregate Bond Index) since the Great
Depression.

Peering into the Future
You may be saving and investing to buy a new home, to put your kid(s)
through college, or to leave a legacy for your children and grandchildren. For
most people, however, a primary goal of investing (as well it should be) is to
achieve economic independence: the ability to work or not work, to write the
Great (or not-so-great) American Novel . . . to do whatever you want to with-
out having to worry about money.

Chapter 12: Dividing Up the Pie: What Percentage Should Be in Bonds?

In Chapters 17 and 18, I discuss in some depth how big a nest egg you’ll likely
need for economic independence and how much you’ll be able to withdraw
from your portfolio, should you stop working, without running out of money.
I’ll save the nitty-gritty for those later chapters (or you can jump ahead and
then return here, if you wish). For now, the pertinent question is this: Just
how far along are you toward achieving your nest-egg goal?
For reasons I divulge in those two upcoming chapters, please think of how
much you will need to withdraw from your nest egg each year when you stop
getting a paycheck. Whatever that number is ($30,000? $40,000?), multiply it
by 20. That is the amount, at a minimum, I would like to see you have in your
total portfolio when you retire. (I’d prefer 25 times, however.) Now multiply
that same original-year withdrawal figure ($30,000? $40,000?) by 10. That is
the amount, at a minimum, that I’d like to see you have in fixed-income
investments, including bonds, when you retire.
I’m assuming here a fairly typical retirement age, somewhere in the 60s. If you
wish to retire at 30, you’ll likely need considerably more than 20 times your
annual expenses (or else very wealthy and generous parents).
Assessing your time frame
Okay. Got those two numbers: one for your total portfolio, and the other for
the bond side of your portfolio at retirement? Good. Now how far off are you,
in terms of both years and dollars, from giving up your paycheck and drawing
on savings?
If you’re far away from your goals, you need lots of growth. If you currently
have, say, half of what you’ll need in your portfolio to call yourself economi-
cally independent, and you are years from retirement, that likely means load-
ing up on stocks if you want to achieve your goal. Vroom vroom.
If you’re closer to your goals, you may have more to lose than to gain, and
stability becomes just as important as growth. That means leaning toward
bonds and other fixed-income investments. Slooow down.
For those of you far beyond your goals (you already have, say, 30 or 40 times
what you’ll need to live on for a year), an altogether other set of criteria may
take precedence.
178
Part III: Customizing and Optimizing Your Bond Portfolio 

Factoring in some good rules
As I hope I made clear at the onset of this chapter (with my silly example of
the boss’s freckles and the cousin named Pablo), there are no simple formu-
las to determine the optimal allocation of bonds in a portfolio. That being
said, there are some pretty good rules to follow. Here, I provide you with a
few, and then I ask you to join me for a few case studies to help clarify:
 Rule #1: You should keep three to six months of living expenses in cash
(such as money market funds or online savings bank accounts like
www.emigrantdirect.com or www.hsbcdirect.com) or near-cash. If
you expect any major expenses in the next year or two, keep money for
those in near-cash as well. When I say near-cash, I’m talking about very
short-term bonds or bond funds, such as those I introduce in Chapter 16.
 Rule #2: The rest of your money can be invested in longer-term invest-
ments, such as intermediate-term or long-term bonds; or equities, such
as stocks, real estate, or commodities.
 Rule #3: A portfolio of more than 75 percent bonds rarely, if ever, makes
sense. On the other hand, most people benefit with some healthy alloca-
tion to bonds. The vast majority of people fall somewhere in the range of
85/15 (85 percent equities/15 fixed income) to 40/60 (40 percent equi-
ties/60 fixed income). Use 60/40 (equities/fixed income) as your default.
Tweak from there depending on how much growth you need and how
much stability you require.
 Rule #4: Stocks, a favorite form of equity for most investors, can be very
volatile over the short term and intermediate term, but history shows
that your risk of loss diminishes with time. Over the course of 10 to 15
years, you are virtually assured that any losses in the stock market will
be earned back — at least if history is our guide. (It shouldn’t be our only
guide! History sometimes does funny things.) Most of the money you
won’t need for 10 to 15 years or beyond should be in stocks, not bonds.
 Rule #5: Because history does funny things, you don’t want to put all
your long-term money in stocks, even if history says you should. Even
very long-term money — at the very least 15 percent of it — should be
kept in something safer than stocks.
Recognizing yourself in a few case studies
Different strokes for different folks. The following vignettes are all based on
real, live clients who have asked me to massage their portfolios. All names
and most identifying information have been changed to protect the identities
of these good people. Perhaps you will see some similarities between their
situations and yours.

Chapter 12: Dividing Up the Pie: What Percentage Should Be in Bonds?

Jean and Raymond, 61 and 63, financially quite comfortable
Married in 1982, Jean and Raymond raised three children; the third is just fin-
ishing up college. Jean and Raymond are both public school teachers and
both will retire (he in two years; she in four) with healthy traditional pen-
sions. Together, those pensions, combined with Social Security, should cover
Jean and Raymond’s living expenses for the rest of their lives. The couple will
also likely bring in supplemental income from private tutoring. Jean’s mother
is 90. When Mom passes away, Jean, an only child, expects to receive an
inheritance of at least $1.5 million. Mom’s money is invested entirely in bonds
and CDs. So what should Jean and Raymond do with the $710,000 they’ve
socked away in their combined retirement plans?
Jean and Raymond are in the catbird seat. Even if they were to invest the
entire $710,000 nest egg in stocks, and even if we were to see the worst stock
market crash in history, Jean and Raymond would likely still be okay. The
couple certainly doesn’t need to take the risk of putting their money in stocks
because they don’t need to see their portfolio grow in order to accomplish
their financial goals. But given their pensions, is investing in stocks really
that risky? No. If Jean and Raymond desire to leave a large legacy (to their
children, grandchildren, or charity), a predominantly stock portfolio would
be the way to go. Because equities tend to be so much more lucrative than
fixed income in the long run, a greater percentage in equities would likely
generate much more wealth for the future generations.
Ignoring for the moment a slew of possibly complicating factors, from the
simple scenario above, I would feel comfortable suggesting an aggressive
portfolio: perhaps 70 to 75 percent equity (stocks and such) and 25 to 30 per-
cent fixed income (bonds and such). I show this breakdown in Figure 12-3. It’s
not what most people think of as appropriate for an “aging” couple, but to
me, it makes a whole lot of sense.
Kay, 59, hoping only for a simple retirement
Kay, divorced twice, earns a very modest salary as a medical technician. She
scored fairly well in her last divorce. (Hubby was a condescending jerk, but a
well-paid condescending jerk.) Thanks to a generous initial cash settlement,
as well as having made a good profit on the sale of her last home, Kay has a
portfolio of $875,000. Kay doesn’t hate her work, but she isn’t crazy about it,
either; she would much rather spend her days doing volunteer work for stray
animals. After careful analysis, she figures that she can live without the pay-
check quite comfortably if allowed to pull $45,000 a year from savings. Her
children are grown and self-sufficient.
180
Part III: Customizing and Optimizing Your Bond Portfolio 

I use Kay to illustrate why simple formulas (such as your age = your proper
bond allocation) don’t work. Kay is roughly the same age as Jean in the previ-
ous example. And Kay, like Jean, is financially comfortable. But it would be a
great mistake for Kay to take the same risks with her money. Unlike Jean, Kay
does not have a spouse. Unlike Jean, Kay does not have a pension. Unlike
Jean, Kay is not expecting a big inheritance. Unlike Jean and Raymond, Kay
cannot afford to lose any significant portion of her nest egg. She is dependent
on that nest egg to stay economically afloat.
At her current level of savings and with a fairly modest rate of growth in her
portfolio, Kay should be able to retire comfortably within four to five years.
In Kay’s case, she has more to lose than to gain by taking any great risk in the
markets. On the other hand, if things work out as she plans, Kay may be
spending 30 or more years in retirement. So an all fixed-income portfolio,
which would get gobbled up by inflation, clearly won’t work. In Kay’s case, 
I would likely recommend a portfolio of 40 to 45 percent bonds and 55 to 60
percent equities (see Figure 12-4).

Juan, 29, just getting started
Three years out of business school with an MBA, Juan, single and happy in
his city condo, is earning an impressive and growing salary. But because he
has been busy paying off loans, he has just started to build his savings.
Juan’s 401(k) has a current balance of $3,700.
Juan — yet another example of why simple formulas don’t work! — should
probably tailor his portfolio to look something like Jean and Raymond’s,
despite the obvious differences in age and wealth. Juan is still many years off
from retirement and doesn’t see any major expenses on the horizon. Juan’s
budding 401(k) is meant to sit and grow for a very long time — at least three
decades. History tells us that a portfolio made up of mostly stocks will pro-
vide maximum growth. Of course, history is history, and we don’t know what
the future would bring. So I would still allocate 15 to 20 percent bonds to
Juan’s portfolio (see Figure 12-5).
Before moving any money into stocks or bonds, however, I would want Juan
to set aside three to six months’ worth of living expenses in an emergency
cash fund, outside of his 401(k), just in case he should lose his job, have seri-
ous health issues, or become subject to some other unforeseen crisis.

Miriam, 53, plugging away
Never married, with no children, Miriam wants to retire from her job as a
freelance computer consultant while still young enough to fulfill her dreams
of world travel. Her investments of $75,000 are growing at a good clip, as she
is currently socking away a full 20 percent of her after-tax earnings — about
$20,000 a year. But she knows that she has a long way to go.
Miriam is right. She does have a long way to go. To fulfill her dreams of world
travel, Miriam will need considerably more than a nest egg of $75,000. In
Miriam’s case, the bond allocation question is a tough one. Miriam needs sub-
stantial growth, but she isn’t in a position to risk what she has, either. Cases
like Miriam’s require delicate balance. I would likely opt for a starting portfo-
lio of mostly stocks and about 20 to 25 percent bonds (see Figure 12-6), but
as Miriam gets closer to her financial goal in coming years, I would urge her
to up that percentage of bonds and take a more defensive, conservative 
position.

Noticing the Many Shades 
of Gray in Your Portfolio
Although the world of investments offers countless opportunities — and 
dangers! — all investments qualify as one of these two types:
 Equity: Something you own (such as stocks, real estate, or gold)
 Fixed income: Money you’ve lent in return for interest (such as bonds,
CDs, or money market funds), or possibly money you’ve given up in
return for steady payments (annuities)
For the sake of simplicity, my portfolio discussion thus far has dealt largely
with “stocks” and “bonds,” ignoring the many shades of gray that define both
of these large umbrella terms. I’ve also ignored other forms of fixed income,
such as annuities, and other forms of equity, such as real estate and com-
modities. It’s time now to stop ignoring and start addressing.

Part III: Customizing and Optimizing Your Bond Portfolio 

Bonds of many flavors
If the point of investing in bonds is to smooth out the returns of a portfolio
that also includes stocks (Yes! That is the point!), it makes sense to have
bonds that tend to zig when stocks zag. By and large, you’re looking at either
Treasuries, including Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (see Chapter 5),
corporate investment-grade bonds (see Chapter 6), or agency bonds (see
Chapter 7). If you’re in the higher tax brackets and have limited space in your
retirement accounts, you may consider municipal bonds (see Chapter 8). If
you have a very large bond portfolio, you may consider a smattering of inter-
national bonds (see Chapter 9).
High-yield bonds (addressed in Chapter 6) may also play a role in your port-
folio, along with other forms of more exotic bonds (see Chapter 9), but they
need to be added with some finesse. As alluring as high-yield bonds can be,
they don’t offer the same diversifying power as do quality bonds. When
stocks sink, high-yield bonds tend to sink as well, for the very same reason:
Companies are closing doors.
Whatever your choice in bonds, it is best to seek some diversification: differ-
ent issuers, different maturities. I make specific recommendations for diversi-
fying the bond side of your portfolio in Chapter 13, again in Chapter 15 where
I discuss individual bonds (diversification mandatory!), and yet again in
Chapter 16 where I talk about bond funds. You can probably tell that I’m
something of a stickler when it comes to diversification!
Stocks of all sizes and sorts
This is a book about bonds, so I won’t dwell on what you should do with the
stock side of your portfolio. In this chapter on portfolio-building, however, it
seems fair to devote at least a few paragraphs to the subject. So here goes:
Because stocks can be so volatile, it is imperative to diversify. The best way
to diversify is with low-cost, no-load mutual funds (index funds are often
best) or exchange-traded funds.
Just as stocks and bonds tend to poorly correlate, different kinds of stocks
and different kinds of bonds similarly have limited correlation. That’s espe-
cially true on the stock side of the portfolio. Smart investors make sure to
have both domestic and foreign stocks, stocks in both large companies and
small companies, and both growth and value stocks. (Growth stocks are
stocks in fast-moving companies in fast-moving industries, such as technol-
ogy. Value stocks are stocks in companies that have less growth potential;
you may be able to get these stocks on the cheap, at times making them
better investments than growth stocks.)
185
Chapter 12: Dividing Up the Pie: What Percentage Should Be in Bonds?

Just as you get more bang for your buck but also more bounce with stocks
versus bonds, you also get more potential return and additional risk with
small-company stocks versus large-company stocks. Although international
stocks aren’t any more volatile than U.S. stocks, per se, differences in
exchange rates can make them much more volatile to U.S. investors. The
greater your tolerance for risk, the more small-company stocks and the more
international stocks you may want to incorporate.
After your portfolio grows and you have all the broad asset classes covered,
you may consider branching out into narrower (but not too narrow) kinds of
investments. Possibilities would include high-yield bonds; small international
company stocks; commodities; and certain industry sectors of the economy,
especially those that tend to have limited correlation to the market at large,
such as real estate and energy.
For more tips on investing in stocks, do not go to your local pub or to various
and sundry get-rich-quick Web sites! Instead, see Stock Investing For Dummies,
2nd edition by Paul Mladjenovic; Mutual Funds For Dummies, 5th edition by
Eric Tyson; or my own entertaining and highly educational Exchange-Traded
Funds For Dummies. (All are published by Wiley.) Sure, there are many other
good books out there (and lots of bad ones too), but the Dummies series is a
darned good place to start.
Other fixed income: Annuities
For some people, sticking an annuity on the fixed-income side of the portfolio
makes sense. When you purchase an annuity, you surrender your principal 
to the issuer of the annuity. In exchange, you receive income at regular 
intervals — at a rate of return considerably higher than you would receive 
by buying a Treasury or municipal bond.
Let me be clear: I’m not talking about variable annuities, most of which are ter-
rible investment products sold by people who make outrageous commissions.
Rather, I’m talking about fixed annuities. The difference? With a variable annu-
ity, you receive payments that are largely based on the performance of some
piece of the market, such as the S&P 500 or another stock index. A fixed annu-
ity gives you a certain fixed amount of income at fixed intervals (which may
be inflation-adjusted). Your payments are not contingent on the performance
of the markets or anything else. And the interest earned may be tax-deferred.
With either kind of annuity, the rate of return will usually be largely deter-
mined by your age. The fewer years the annuity provider thinks he’ll be send-
ing you checks, the more generous he’ll be with his payments.
186
Part III: Customizing and Optimizing Your Bond Portfolio 

At the time I’m writing this, a 65-year-old man with $100,000 could get about 8
percent on an immediate fixed annuity for the rest of his life. Treasuries are
currently paying about 5 percent. But keep this in mind: If the investor dies
tomorrow after taking out an annuity today, his estate loses $100,000. He
could get an annuity with a death benefit (so his spouse continues to get pay-
ments should he die), but that lowers the rate of return.
The best candidates for annuities are generally healthy people with good
genes in their 60s or 70s who don’t mind dying broke and don’t care about
leaving behind any chunk of money. It is important to remember that an
annuity is only as good as the company issuing it. Don’t even consider buying
an annuity from anything less than a huge and stable issuer, such as
Vanguard or Fidelity. I would generally recommend only inflation-adjusted
annuities; otherwise, you risk seeing your income get swallowed up by infla-
tion to the point that your monthly checks will seem like pin money.
Some investment houses, Vanguard and Fidelity included, have begun to offer
very modestly priced fixed annuities without the horrible surrender charges
that plague this industry. Typically, if you sign up for an annuity and then
change your mind and want your principal back, you’ll be penalized to the
tune of 7 percent if you try to withdraw your money within a year, 6 percent if
you try to withdraw within two years, and so on.
For more on annuities, check out Annuities For Dummies, written by a friend
of mine (and fellow resident of Allentown, Pennsylvania), Kerry Pechter, and
being published in 2008 by Wiley.
Other equity: Commodities and real estate
Equity is investment-speak for “something you own.” It doesn’t have to be a
share in a company. You can own real estate, silver, gold, or corn futures. Real
estate, if it refers to your own home, should generally not be considered part
of your nest egg, simply because you will always need a place to live. Selling
your home and downsizing or moving to an apartment may someday add to
the size of your nest egg, and you always have the option of a reverse mort-
gage (although it is expensive), but you should not count on your home as
your main retirement fund.
Investment real estate can indeed be profitable, but only if you know what
you’re doing and are willing to clock some serious hours landlording. It helps
to know something about plumbing. And my own personal nightmare a
number of years ago involving a property in Maryland tells me that no one
should ever be a long-distance landlord!

Commodity investing was once a sticky business, with high fees and compli-
cated strategies. Lately, with the advent of exchange-traded funds and
exchange-traded notes that allow you to buy into commodity indexes, com-
modity investing is no more complicated than buying a stock or bond fund.
Commodities have limited correlation to both stocks and bonds, and I recom-
mend a position of 5 to 10 percent commodities for most people’s portfolios.
My favorite vehicle for tapping into commodities is the Barclays iPath Dow
Jones-AIG Commodity Index exchange-traded note (ticker symbol DJP),
which I discuss at the end of Chapter 9. By the time you are reading this
book, however, there may be many more options.
Making Sure That Your Portfolio 
Remains in Balance
Say you’ve decided that you want a portfolio of 60 percent equities and 40
percent fixed income (commonly expressed as a 60/40 portfolio). You have
$100,000, so you aim to construct a portfolio that is $60,000 in stocks and
$40,000 in bonds.
Over the ensuing months, the stock market takes off. At the end of a great
year, you count your blessings and realize that you now have not $60,000, but
$75,000 in stocks. Your bonds, however, have hardly budged. Let’s say you
have $41,000 in bonds. Your entire portfolio is now worth ($75,000 + $41,000)
$116,000. But it is no longer a 60/40 portfolio. It is now a 65/35 portfolio.
Funny how that happens.
What to do? It is time to rebalance.
Rebalancing means getting your investment house back in order. Unless your
life circumstances have changed, you probably still want a 60/40 portfolio.
That means that your new $116,000 portfolio should be ($116,000 x 60 per-
cent) $69,600 in stocks, and ($116,000 x 40 percent) $46,400 in bonds. In order
to get to that point, you’re going to have to sell ($75,000 – $69,600) $5,400 in
stocks and buy ($46,400 – $41,000) $5,400 in bonds.
It won’t be easy. You’ve seen your stocks go up, up, up, while your bonds have
languished. But rebalancing is the smart thing to do. Let me explain why.
188
Part III: Customizing and Optimizing Your Bond Portfolio 

Tweaking your holdings to temper risk
The primary reason to rebalance is this: to keep you from losing your shirt. If
your personal situation a year ago warranted a 60/40 portfolio, then a 65/35
split is going to be more volatile than the portfolio you want. If you continue
to leave the portfolio untouched and stocks continue to fly, you’ll eventually
wind up with a 70/30 portfolio, and then a 75/25 portfolio. And what happens
if the stock market reverses at that point, moving as quickly backwards as it
was moving forwards a year or two before? You’ll see a much larger loss than
you ever bargained for.
Wouldn’t you rather lock in some of your profits, and start afresh with the
proper portfolio mix?
Savoring the rebalancing bonus
Rebalancing also helps you to realize larger returns over time. Think about it:
Most investors buy high, choosing whatever asset class is hot, and sell low,
getting rid of whatever asset class is lagging. The financial press is continu-
ally pushing us to do this — “10 HOT FUNDS FOR THE NEW YEAR!” inevitably
focuses in on ten funds that have risen to new heights in the past months,
largely because of the kind of asset class in which they invest (U.S. stocks,
foreign stocks, long-term bonds, or whatever).
Studies show that, as a result of continually buying high and selling low, the
average investor barely keeps up with inflation. It’s sad. But you, by rebalanc-
ing regularly, are destined to wind up ahead. Rather than buying high and
selling low, you will continually be selling high and buying low. In the example
above, you were selling off your recently risen stocks, for example, and
buying more of your lagging bonds.
Over the long run, not only will rebalancing temper your risk, but your long-
term returns, if we’re simply talking about rebalancing stocks and bonds, will
tend to be about 1⁄2 percent higher.
Need proof?
Consider the ten-year average annual return of the Vanguard Total Stock and
the Vanguard Total Bond Index funds. They currently clock in at 8.03 percent
average annual return for the stock fund and 6.07 percent for the bond fund.
Adding the two together, giving the stocks a 60-percent weighting and the
bonds a 40-percent weighting, you would expect the average annual ten-year
return of the two to be 7.25 percent. But when you look at the Vanguard
Balanced Index fund, which combines the total stock market with the total
bond market and continually rebalances, the average annual return for the
same period (ending February 28, 2007) is not 7.25 percent — it’s 7.64 percent.
189

If you invest in multiple asset classes (including commodities, foreign and
domestic stock, and so on), regular rebalancing may add a full percentage
point or more each year to your long-term returns.
Scheduling your portfolio rebalance
With the miracle of modern technology, Excel spreadsheets and whatnot,
rebalancing can be easy — too easy! Rebalancing your portfolio every week,
or even every month, is most likely going to be counterproductive. There are
often transaction costs, and there may be potential capital gains taxes with
every sale you make. But another important (and often overlooked) factor is
the momentum of markets: When an asset class shoots up, all those yokels
out there who like buying something that is up will often, by the very fact
that they are buying, force the price a bit higher.
The question of how often to rebalance has been studied to death, and those
studies show that someone who rebalances as often as he brushes his teeth
tends to lose out to momentum — in addition to paying more in transaction
costs and taxes.
So, what’s the perfect time to rebalance? There is no perfect time. It depends
on the volatility of the markets, the correlation of the securities in your port-
folio, the cost of your personal transactions, and your tax status. In general,
however, rebalancing should be done once every year or two. If you are
retired and pulling cash from your portfolio, you may want to rebalance twice
a year in order to make sure your cash reserve doesn’t dip too low. But do be
careful whenever selling securities to watch your trading costs, and monitor
your potential tax hit.
The division between stocks and bonds, be it 70/30 or 50/50 or 30/70, is often
the most important risk-and-return determiner in your portfolio. Even if you
allow everything else to get out of balance, keep your balance of stocks and
bonds on an even keel.
Such balance, grasshopper, will keep you afloat and spare you from getting
slammed into financial bridges or swamped by the wake of inflation.

E
ach spring, as the crocuses sprout and the song birds return to my yard,
I face the difficult question of whether to call Mike. Mike is a guy in my
town with a truck, and for a flat price, often much less than the local nursery
charges, he’ll drop an entire truckload of mulch — ka-chunk — onto my drive-
way. Given the cost savings, and the fact that I don’t particularly enjoy lug-
ging home big plastic, leaking bags of mulch in my car, it seems like a
slam-dunk decision.
It isn’t.
Most years, I simply can’t use as much mulch as Mike’s required minimum. So
I wind up shoveling mulch on mulch, begging the neighbors to take some,
watching the dregs biodegrade on my driveway, and then waiting for the
summer rains to flush the rest away.
Of course, the question of how much mulch to buy goes hand-in-hand with
what kind of mulch to buy. There’s hardwood mulch. Pine mulch. Cypress
mulch. There are big chips. Little chips. Shredded mulch. And finely pureed
mulch. And then there’s the more exotic cocoa-bean mulch, which comes
largely from The Hershey Company in nearby Hershey, Pennsylvania. Yup, it
smells like chocolate.

This chapter is about picking the kinds of bonds you’re going to put into your
portfolio. It’s just like buying mulch. You look first at the quantity of fixed
income you need. You then decide on the particular kinds of bonds: Treasuries,
corporates, munis, or maybe something more exotic. Finally, you need to
decide where and how to purchase them.
Mike the mulch guy doesn’t sell bonds (as far as I know), but The Hershey
Company sells them by the truckload. Unfortunately, they don’t smell like
chocolate.
Reviewing the Rationale Behind Bonds
In Chapter 12, I present a plan for dividing a portfolio largely between stocks
and bonds. Stocks and bonds are yin and yang, peanut butter and jelly, Fred
and Ginger, cookies and milk, tequila and taxi-rides home — they go together
perfectly. Stocks are where you’re likely to get your growth. Bonds provide
predictability and stability.
Any other reasons for having bonds in your portfolio — such as getting a
stream of income — are nice, but secondary. (If it seems that I’m too lightly
kissing off the importance of bond income, read Chapter 17.)
Some bonds are more volatile than others. That matters, for sure. But what
also matters, and perhaps matters more, is the extent to which the price of
bonds tends to rise and fall with the price of stocks. The kinds of bonds that
historically zig when stocks zag are by and large the kinds of bonds that
should dominate most people’s bond portfolios. And those kinds of bonds
are government and agency bonds, high quality (investment-grade) corpo-
rate bonds (like Hershey’s), and municipal bonds.
Making your initial selection
In Part II, I outline the different kinds of bonds I mentioned here, and I review
their most distinguishing characteristics. But in choosing a type or types 
of bonds to put in your portfolio, you also need to look at your personal
characteristics.
For example, what may your need for funds be over the next several years?
What is your tax bracket? Are you subject to the sneaky alternative minimum
tax? How much room do you have in your retirement accounts? How heavily
is the stock side of your portfolio invested overseas? How subject are you to
the ravages of inflation? These are some of the things that make me different
from you, and may make my “perfect” bond portfolio very different from your
“perfect” bond portfolio.
192
Part III: Customizing and Optimizing Your Bond Portfolio 

As I do in Chapter 12, here I give you the best rules I can. Then, toward the
end of this chapter, I provide a few case studies to help sharpen your sights
on what kinds of bonds may best match your investment goals.
Following a few rules
These guidelines should begin to give you an idea of the kinds of bonds you
may want. They are quick and a bit dirty. I clean them up — and get more
specific in my recommendations — as this chapter rolls along.
 Rule #1: It’s best to keep three to six months of living expenses in cash
(a savings account or money market fund) or near-cash for emergencies.
For any major expenses you anticipate in the next couple years, you may
want to keep that money in near-cash as well. By near-cash, I mean very
short-term bonds or bond funds maturing in one to three years. Short-
term bonds generally pay slightly higher rates of interest than savings
accounts and money market funds but less interest than longer-term
bonds. Correspondingly, they can be a wee bit more volatile than a
money market account but far less volatile than longer-term bonds.
 Rule #2: Money you won’t need in the next few years should be invested
in higher yielding securities for greater income and growth. These secu-
rities include bonds with maturities of three years and greater.
 Rule #3: The majority of your bond holdings should be high-quality
bonds, be they Treasuries, corporate bonds, agency bonds, or munis. If
you’re looking for higher return and can take the risk, you’re usually
going to be better off moving into stocks than into high-yield bonds.
Go with munis if your tax bracket warrants it and if you are investing in a
taxable account. See Chapter 8 for all the muni formulas you need. As for
the other bonds, it is preferable to mix and match both issuers and
maturities.
 Rule #4: Whatever your allocation to fixed income, about one-third should
be inflation-adjusted, either with an inflation adjusted annuity or with spe-
cial bonds called Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS). TIPS are a
nice complement to other bonds because they tend not to correlate to
other bonds in their price movements. If inflation takes off, traditional
bonds tend to suffer, but TIPS tend to flourish. (In 2000, for example, TIPS
returned 13.17 percent, while high-yield bonds returned –5.21 percent.)
If inflation is less than expected, however, TIPS won’t do as well. (In 2006, 
for example, high-yield bonds returned 11.92 percent, and TIPS returned 
0.41 percent.)
193
Chapter 13: Which Kinds of Bonds Make the Most Sense for You?

Sizing Up Your Need for Fixed-Income
Diversification
As you know, some stocks can double or triple in price overnight, while
others can shrink into oblivion in the time it takes to say “CEO arrested for
fraud.” Unless you are investing in individual high-yield bonds (not a good
idea), your risk of default — and your investment shrinking to oblivion — will
be minimal. But diversifying your bonds is still a very good idea.
Although you can negate your risk of default by simply buying Treasury
bonds, you still incur other risks by having too concentrated a bond 
portfolio.
Diversifying by maturity
Regardless of whether you invest in Treasuries, corporate bonds, or munis,
you always risk swings in general interest rates (which can send bond prices
tumbling) and reinvestment risk (the fact that interest or principal invested in
a bond may not be able to be reinvested in such a way that it can earn the
same rate of return as before). Both risks can be greatly ameliorated with the
fine art of laddering, or staggering your individual bond purchases to include
bonds of differing maturities. I discuss laddering in Chapter 15. Both risks can
also be greatly lessened by investing in bond funds, discussed in Chapter 16.
Diversifying by type of issuer
In addition to diversifying by maturity, you also want to divide up your bonds
so they represent different kinds of bond categories, such as government and
corporate. This is true with both individual bonds and bond funds. Different
kinds of bonds do better in certain years than others. Having various types of
bonds helps to smooth out your total bond portfolio returns.
Let’s take two years — 2002 and 2004 — as examples.
The year 2002 was an extraordinarily great year for bonds. Interest rates were
falling, and investors, bruised by a falling stock market, were looking for
safety in fixed income. That helped to drive up demand for bonds, which
tends to drive up the price. That year, from January to December, we saw the
following juicy returns:
194
Part III: Customizing and Optimizing Your Bond Portfolio 

 Long-term government bonds: 11.79 percent
 Municipal bonds: 9.60 percent
 Investment-grade corporate bonds: 8.58 percent
But 2004 was a not-so good year for bonds. Investors were bidding au revoir
to bonds and moving back into stocks. Interest rates were no longer falling.
Government bonds just about kept even with inflation. Munis and corporates
fared better:
 Investment-grade corporate bonds: 6.25 percent
 Municipal bonds: 4.48 percent
 Long-term government bonds: 3.54 percent
Generally, investment-grade corporate bonds do better than government
bonds when the economy is strong. When the economy is weak (and people
flock to safety), government bonds — especially long-term Treasuries — tend
to do better. If you think you can tell the future, buy all one kind of bond or
the other. If you realize that you are not clairvoyant, it probably makes the
most sense to divide your holdings.
Diversifying by risk-and-return potential
The returns on high quality corporate bonds, Treasuries, and munis (after
their tax-free nature is accounted for) generally differ by only a percentage
point or two in any given year. But some other kinds of bonds, such as high-
yield corporates, convertible bonds, and international bonds, can vary much,
much more.
In general, because the potential return on stocks is so much higher than just
about any kind of bond, I favor stomaching volatility on the stock side of the
portfolio.
For some people, however, more exotic, “cocoa-bean” type bonds make
sense. High-yield bonds, for example, act like a hybrid between stocks and
bonds. They often produce high returns (higher than other bonds, lower than
stocks) when the economy is growing fast, and they tend to take dives (more
than other bonds, less than stocks) when the economy falters. Because of
this hybrid nature, they make particular sense for relatively conservative
investors who need the high yield but can’t take quite as much risk as stocks
involve.
195
Chapter 13: Which Kinds of Bonds Make the Most Sense for You?

Emerging-market bonds (issued by the governments of poor countries) also
can produce very high yields but can be very volatile. Unlike U.S. high-yield
bonds, they tend to have limited correlation to the U.S. stock market. For this
reason, I often include a small percentage of emerging-market bonds in many
people’s portfolios.
Diversifying away managerial risk
Where I discuss bond funds in Chapter 16, I suggest that you put most of your
bond money into index funds: funds run by managers who work on the cheap
and do not attempt to do anything fancy. But occasionally, taking a bet on a
talented manager may not be such a terrible thing to do. And regardless of
what I say, you may turn your nose up at index funds anyway. You may
attempt to beat the market by choosing bond funds run by managers who try
to score big by rapid buying and selling, going out on margin, and all sorts of
other wild and crazy things.
Whenever you go with an actively managed fund (as opposed to a passively
managed fund, otherwise known as an index fund), you hope that the man-
ager will do something smart to beat the market. But you risk that he or she
will do something dumb. Or that manager may get hit by a train, and the fund
winds up getting managed by the incompetent junior partner. That is called
managerial risk.
Managerial risk is real, and it should always be diversified away. If you have a
sizeable bond portfolio and you are depending on that portfolio to pay the
bills some day, you shouldn’t trust any one manager with that much responsi-
bility. Recall the numbers from the “Diversifying by type of issuer” section,
which reflect the differences among returns of different kinds of bonds in a
couple sample years? That is nothing compared to the differences you find
between well-managed and poorly managed active bond funds.
According to Morningstar Principia,
 The ten-year cumulative return on the well-run Loomis Sayles Bond
Fund is 148.65 percent.
 The ten-year cumulative return on the not-so-well-run Morgan Stanley
High Yield Fund is –23.40 percent.
If you’re going to take a shot at beating the market by giving your bond
money to managers who tinker and toy (yes, even Dan Fuss, the very talented
manager at Loomis Sayles — see Chapter 21), do it in moderation, please.
196
Part III: Customizing and Optimizing Your Bond Portfolio 

Weighing Diversification 
Versus Complication
Most individual bonds sell for $1,000. But buying individual bonds (not
Treasuries, but most other bonds) can be very expensive. You can’t very well
build a diversified bond portfolio — different maturities, different issuers —
out of individual bonds unless you have quite a few grand sitting around.
Diversifying with funds isn’t the easiest thing in the world, either. Most bond
funds have minimums, often in the $1,000 to $3,000 range. And exchange-
traded funds, even though they have no minimums, carry trading fees. In
other words, if you haven’t got a fair chunk of change, building a diversified
bond portfolio can be a challenge. But I do have a few suggestions for all you
non-millionaires.
Keeping it simple with balanced funds
(for people with under $5,000)
If you have under $5,000 to invest, you are going to find little choice if you
want a balanced portfolio. Forget about individual stocks and bonds. Even
building a fund portfolio, given the minimums of most funds, will be tough.
Best solution: Consider a balanced fund, a one-stop-shopping fund that allows
you to invest in stocks and bonds in one fell swoop. Note that some balanced
funds are static; they will allocate, say, 60 percent of your money to stocks and
40 percent to bonds, and that is how it will always be. Others are dynamic;
these are often called life cycle funds. A life cycle fund has a target retirement
date and, as you move toward that date, the fund shifts your money, usually
from the stock side to the bond side, to become more conservative.
See my recommendations for the Vanguard STAR Fund in Chapter 16.
Moving beyond the basic (for people 
with $5,000 to $10,000)
In the ballpark of $5,000 to $10,000, you may be looking to invest several
thousand in stocks and several thousand in bonds. Your best bet for building
a diversified portfolio would be a handful of low-cost, no-load mutual funds.
Perhaps you want one total market bond fund, one total U.S. stock fund, and
one diversified foreign stock fund.
197
Chapter 13: Which Kinds of Bonds Make the Most Sense for You?

See Chapter 16 for my recommendations for total market bond funds.
Branching out (with $10,000 or more)
With $10,000 or more, you can begin to entertain a more finely segmented
portfolio of either mutual funds or exchange-traded funds. But you’ll proba-
bly want more than $10,000 in the bond side of your portfolio before you sell
your total market bond fund and start diversifying into the various sectors of
the bond market.
I wouldn’t suggest dabbling in individual bonds unless you have a bond port-
folio of $100,000 or so. Otherwise, the trading costs will eat you alive. The
exception would be Treasury bonds because you can buy them at www.
treasurydirect.gov without any markup. Even some large brokerage
houses allow you to buy Treasuries without a markup.
Finding the Perfect Bond Portfolio Fit
In Chapter 12, I introduce four portfolios, belonging to Jean and Raymond,
Kay, Juan, and Miriam. In that chapter, I suggest what percentage of their
portfolios should be in bonds. I revisit our friends here to suggest what spe-
cific kinds of bonds they might consider.
Case studies in bond ownership
You’ll notice that just as there are no hard and fast rules for the percentage of
a portfolio that should be in bonds, there are no absolutes when it comes to
what kind of bonds are optimal for any given investor.
Jean and Raymond, 61 and 63, financially fit as a fiddle
These folks have a solid portfolio of nearly three-quarters of a million dollars.
A fat inheritance is likely coming. They are both still working in secure jobs,
and when they retire, their (inflation-adjusted) pensions and Social Security
should cover all the basic bills. With their children and grandchildren in mind
and having little to risk with any volatility in the markets, Jean and Raymond
have wisely decided to invest 75 percent of their savings (all in their retire-
ment accounts) in equities — mostly stocks, with some commodities. The
198
Part III: Customizing and Optimizing Your Bond Portfolio 

other 25 percent ($177,500) they have chosen to invest in fixed income. What
to do with the fixed income? Financially fit as they seem, Jean and Raymond
still could use an emergency kitty. Because they are both older than 591⁄2 and
are allowed to pull from their retirement accounts without penalty, I would
suggest three months’ living expenses ($15,000) be kept in cash or in a very
short-term bond fund, of the kind I suggest in Chapter 16.
Okay, that still leaves them with $162,500. Chances are this money won’t be
touched for quite some time — perhaps not until after Jean and Raymond
have passed to that great teachers’ lounge in the sky, and their children and
grandchildren inherit their estate. That being the case, it warrants investing
in higher yielding bonds. But just in case the economy takes a real fall and
the lion’s share of the estate goes with it, these bonds should be strong
enough to stand tall.
Tax-free munis make no sense in this case because Jean and Raymond have
room in their retirement accounts, and munis, which pay lower rates of inter-
est than bonds of comparable quality and maturity, never make sense in a
tax-advantaged retirement account.
I would suggest nearly one-third of the pot (approximately $54,200) be put
into long-term Treasuries, either in a bond fund or, perhaps better yet, into
individual bonds through www.treasurydirect.gov. Another almost one-
third should go into Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), again
either in a TIPS fund (see my recommendation in Chapter 16) or individual
TIPS purchased free of markup on the Treasury’s own Web site. The final
almost one-third should go either into a fund of investment-grade corporate
bonds or a handful of individual investment-grade corporate bonds. The cor-
porate bonds over time will tend to return higher interest than the govern-
ment bonds but may not do quite as well if the economy hits the skids.
If Jean and Raymond want to place a small percentage of their bond alloca-
tion in a foreign bond fund, that money could be worked into the mix (taking
away equally from the other categories). It would add a bit more diversifica-
tion to the portfolio. But foreign bond funds have their pros and cons, as 
I discuss in Chapter 9. Whether the couple goes with a foreign bond fund or
not would depend on how much exposure they had to foreign currencies on
the equity side of their portfolio. I present some good international bond
funds in Chapter 16.
See Figure 13-1 for a chart that reflects my recommendations to Jean and
Raymond.
199
Chapter 13: Which Kinds of Bonds Make the Most Sense for You?

Kay, 59, approaching retirement
Kay, our divorced medical technician, is currently on her own. She needs a
larger emergency fund than do Jean and Raymond. Having no pension, she
will also be reliant on her portfolio when she retires and can’t take quite as
much risk as the older married couple. (Simple formulas that say you need to
take less risk as you get older simply aren’t very helpful much of the time.)
Kay’s healthy portfolio of $875,000 is divided 60/40 between equities and
fixed income. That equates to $350,000 in fixed income.
Where to put it?
Kay needs a somewhat larger cash cushion for emergencies than do Jean and
Raymond. She is, after all, on her own, although her adult children could help
her in a real emergency. I would allot four to five months of her fixed income
to either a money market fund or a very short-term bond fund. That would
still leave $330,000 to invest in higher yielding instruments.
Kay doesn’t care about leaving an inheritance. Her kids are grown and doing
very well. She is also of good genes, eats granola and grapefruit for breakfast,
and expects to live a long life. In four or five years, when Kay plans to retire,
she will be a good candidate for an inflation-adjusted fixed annuity that will
guarantee her an income stream throughout the rest of her life.

Part III: Customizing and Optimizing Your Bond Portfolio 

I would set up a bond portfolio for her with the intention of making the move
to an annuity when Kay is in her mid-60s (provided interest rates at that time
are favorable). Kay needs a bond portfolio that will be there for her in four or
five years, providing income and, more importantly, providing the cash she’ll
need to live on in retirement should the other 60 percent of her portfolio —
the stocks — take a dive. With $330,000 to invest in bonds, roughly twice
what our teacher couple has to invest, I would suggest a somewhat more
diversified bond allocation.
Kay may start by taking a third of her bond money ($110,000) and buying
either a Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) fund or individual TIPS
through www.treasurydirect.gov. These bonds offer modest rates of
return but adjust the principal twice a year for inflation. If inflation goes on a
rampage, Kay will have some protection on the fixed-income side of her 
portfolio.
With the other two-thirds of her bond portfolio ($220,000), I would suggest
equal allocations to long-term traditional Treasuries, intermediate-term
Treasuries, long-term investment-grade corporate bonds, intermediate-term
investment-grade corporate bonds, international bonds, and high-yield bonds
(see Figure 13-2).

Juan, 29, building up his savings
Juan’s 401(k) has a current balance of just $3,700, but he’s making a good
salary.
I would first encourage Juan to save up enough so he can set aside three to
six months’ living expenses in an emergency cash fund.
Given that his 401(k) money is (we hope) not going to be touched until 
Juan is at least 591⁄2 (and able to make withdrawals without penalty), he has
decided to allocate only 15 percent of his retirement fund to bonds — just
about right.
The purpose of those bonds is to somewhat smooth out his account’s
returns, provide the opportunity to rebalance, and be there just in case of an
economic apocalypse. Juan, of course, is prisoner to his 401(k) investment
options, be they what they are.
If his employer’s plan is like most, he may have the option of one mixed-matu-
rity Treasury fund and one mixed-maturity corporate-bond fund. Because
we’re talking about only 15 percent of his portfolio, whichever way he goes
shouldn’t make a huge difference over the next few years. I’d suggest splitting
the baby and going half and half (see Figure 13-3).

Should Juan leave his job, he may be able to transfer his 401(k) to his new
place of employment, or he may be able to roll it into an individual retirement
plan (IRA). I would usually advise the latter because IRAs typically offer
better investment choices at lower costs. At that point, should Juan open an
IRA, and should the balance grow beyond several thousand dollars, I would
encourage greater diversification of his bonds.
Miriam, 53, behind on her goals
With $75,000 in savings and the good majority in stocks, Miriam’s 22 percent
in bonds ($16,500) must serve two purposes: First, it must provide ballast to
smooth out the year-to-year return of her investments. Second, it must help
provide cash flow when (within a decade, we hope) Miriam is able to retire
and fulfill her dreams of world travel.
Miriam is currently making Trump dollars in her job as a freelance computer
consultant — about $160,000 a year. But she lives in New York City, paying
high city and state taxes. She rents rather than owns her home, so she gets
no mortgage deduction. Being self-employed, Miriam does not have a 401(k)
but is socking away about $20,000 a year in her SEP-IRA. The $75,000 in sav-
ings is half in her IRA and half outside her IRA.
Given Miriam’s relatively high tax bracket and the fact she pays a boatload in
taxes, it would make most sense for Miriam to have her $16,500 in her taxable
account socked away in high-quality municipal bonds or in a muni bond fund
exempt from federal, state, and local taxes (see Figure 13-4).

Chapter 13: Which Kinds of Bonds Make the Most Sense for You?

Seeking out the more exotic offerings
You may have noted that none of these case scenarios calls for more exotic
(“cocoa-bean” type) bonds. Sometimes, I like exotic. High-yield bonds from
abroad, for example, have very handsome historical returns and, unlike U.S.
high-yield bonds, tend to rise and fall somewhat independently of the U.S.
stock market. That is especially true of so-called emerging-market bonds
(bonds from poor countries). Because of their extreme volatility, however, 
I recommend putting emerging-market bonds, in modest allocations, on the
equity side of the portfolio.
Ditto for exchange-traded notes, bond-like instruments that don’t pay a steady
rate of interest but rather offer a yield tied to a certain benchmark, such as a
commodity index that tracks the fortunes of gold, silver, and corn futures.
See further discussion of both emerging-market bonds and exchange-traded
notes in Chapter 9.
In Chapter 12, I discuss rebalancing. It is crucial, after you set up a properly
allocated portfolio, to go in once a year or so and make sure that if you allo-
cated, say, 60 percent to equities and 40 percent to fixed income, those 
allocations don’t go too far astray. At the same time, you want to check once
a year or so to make certain that your bond allocations — your division
between Treasuries, corporates, munis, and other kinds of bonds — are
where you want them to be.
Perhaps you can rebalance your portfolio every spring, just about the same
time you spread your mulch. I don’t know if Mike-with-the-truck does that,
but that’s what I do.

n the following three chapters, I will make you a savvy
bond investor. I promise! By the time you finish Part IV,
you’ll be trading bonds like a pro.
The action starts with Chapter 14. Here, I help you through
the crucial first question you need to ask before trading
bonds: Are you going to be trading individual bonds, or
bond funds? While attacking that question, I also address
the issue of investment containers: whether it makes 
more sense to store your bonds or bond funds in taxable
accounts or in tax-advantaged retirement accounts. I also
touch on the timing of your bond purchases: whether it
makes sense to wait for the right kind of interest environ-
ment, or whether you should just jump in tomorrow.
Chapter 15 shows you the ropes where it comes to buying
and selling individual bonds. You find out how to negoti-
ate the best deals and, using some rather revolutionary
new tools, lower your transaction costs greatly.
And finally, Chapter 16 gets you up to snuff on bond funds:

n 1497, Vasco da Gama, a man from Portugal with a bushy beard and funny
pants, gathered up 170 of his cronies, most of whom also had bushy
beards and funny pants, and set sail for India. Along the way, da Gama and
company encountered fierce ocean storms, thirst, hunger, disease, and hos-
tile natives who hated the pants.
But the intrepid travelers, in their four rickety vessels, made it to India, did a
bit of sightseeing, picked up a few bags of spices, and headed for home. The
trip was deemed a great success, and Mr. da Gama was hailed a hero —
despite the pants, two years of misery at sea, half of his boats lost, and 116
dead cronies.
The fact that you could sail from Europe to India was seen as a great advance
for humankind. As grueling and treacherous as the seagoing voyage was, it
was still preferable to doing the 5,500 miles from Portugal to India on foot.
A short number of years ago, if you wanted to invest in bonds, you had a sim-
ilarly bitter choice. You could either walk into the office of your local bond
broker and face fierce markups on individual bonds, or you could sail into
the sea of funds and deal with hostile management fees and loads. Whichever
option you chose, whatever kind of pants you were wearing, bond investing
was often a very perilous journey.
Today’s bond market is becoming a friendlier place. Let me introduce you.

Discovering the Brave 
New World of Bonds
Regardless of which way you decide to invest your money, bond funds or
individual bonds, the going is easier and potentially more lucrative today
than it was just several years ago. And it is getting easier all the time.
Finding fabulously frugal funds
Expensive bond funds still exist. According to Morningstar, more than 400 of
them charge 2 percent or more in annual fees. Imagine. At today’s modest inter-
est rates, most bonds pay only about 5 percent a year. That’s a nominal —
before inflation — 5 percent a year. After inflation, you’re looking at a total real
return of about 2 to 3 percent a year. After taxes, you’re looking at less than
that. And you’re going to fork over 2 percent to a fund manager? Lots of people
do! They haven’t yet read this book.
But paying such fees, once a hard thing to avoid, is now strictly optional. Yes,
the times they are a changin’. In 1998, 36 bond funds had expense ratios
below 0.50 percent. Today, that number is over 300. In the past ten years,
according to Morningstar figures, the number of bond funds charging annual
fees of 0.20 percent or less has increased by more than 50 percent.
The lowering of mutual-fund fees is largely due to the recent introduction of
exchange-traded funds (ETFs). If you want to know more about ETFs, well, 
I wrote an entire book about them: Exchange-Traded Funds For Dummies
(Wiley). ETFs are wonderful investment vehicles in their own right — both
inexpensive and tax-efficient. They have also given some serious competition
to mutual funds, and that has resulted in a lowering of fees across the board.
A new line-up of ETFs from Vanguard, which anyone with minimal money 
can buy, allows you to invest in numerous bond index funds, Treasury or 
corporate, short-term or long-term, for an annual fee of a mere 0.11 percent. 
A number of bond index mutual funds from Vanguard and Fidelity — the two
largest U.S. financial supermarkets — are charging annual fees in the same ball-
park (although most of these mutual funds have minimums of at least $3,000).
Dealing in individual bonds without 
dealing over a fortune
The transaction costs on individual bonds, which have traditionally been way
higher than stock transaction costs, have been dropping faster than hail.

Part IV: Bonds Away! Navigating the Fixed-Income Marketplace 

One 2004 study from the Securities and Exchange Commission found that 
the average cost of a $5,000 corporate bond trade back then was $84, or 1.68
percent — equivalent to several months’ interest. Smaller trades (less than
$5,000) tended to whack investors with much higher costs.

Peek-a-boo: Bond trades move out 
of the darkness, into the light
Once upon a time, you’d go to buy (or sell) a
bond, and you’d say to your bond broker,
“Hello,” and he would say to you, “Hello! How
are you? How are the kids?” And you would say,
“Good. Good.” And then the bond broker would
tell you about a real beaut of an A-rated bond,
with a maturity of ten years and a coupon rate of
5.46 percent . . . blah, blah, blah. And you would
say, “Uh-huh,” and you would then fork over
$5,000 or so having no idea whether the broker
was enjoying a $5 markup, a $50 markup, or
even a $500 markup.
Bond trades in those dark but not-so-distant
days were done by telephone, one broker to
another, and the clients were more or less at
their mercy. You couldn’t look up bond prices in
the daily paper, as you could stock prices. There
was no agreed-to commission, as there was
with stocks. And there was no Internet. Many
bond traders were good people, making a fair
living but still looking out for their clients’ best
interests. Others would never give a sucker an
even break, carving off the lion’s share of the
investor’s potential profits and hoarding it for
themselves.
Both kinds of brokers still exist, for sure. But
thanks to the Trade Reporting and Compliance
Engine (and, of course, Bond Investing For
Dummies, which is clueing people into the
Engine), suckers are getting rarer and rarer, and
profit-hoarding brokers are having to find new
careers.
Known most commonly by its acronym, TRACE,
the Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine is
a baby of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) and the former National
Association of Securities Dealers (NASD),
which is now part of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority (FINRA). TRACE began in
July 2002 and was phased in over several years.
As of February 2005, every corporate bond trade
in the United States — replete with all the infor-
mation about the trade you could hope for —
gets reported into the system and shows up on
the Web, in living color. A parallel system for
municipal bonds is run by an outfit called the
Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board.
So now if a broker says that you can get an 
A-rated bond with a maturity of ten years and 
a coupon rate of 5.46 percent, you can immedi-
ately go online (to www.finra.org or
www.investinginbonds.com) and see
the most recent trades made on that particular
bond. That will often reveal what that broker
paid for the very same bond he is now offering
to sell you for $5,000. If you can’t find that very
same bond, you can find very similar bonds:
other A-rated bonds with similar maturity. If you
wish to sell a bond, you can see what other
people are getting on the open market for bonds
similar to yours. In Chapter 15, I walk you
through the system, step by step. You’ll like it!
And you — not some middleman — will profit
from it!

Trade costs of municipal bonds (a favorite flavor of bond among individuals
in high tax brackets), according to the same study, averaged 2.23 percent —
equivalent perhaps to a full year’s return after inflation — for trades of
$25,000 or less. For trades from $25,000 to $100,000, the average price spread
was 1.12 percent.
Since 2004, the cost of bond trading has dropped considerably. Although I
haven’t seen any very recent studies, my guess would be that a savvy bond
investor willing to do some legwork can now buy a typical corporate or
municipal bond for about half the cost that he or she would have incurred in
2004. Bond sales can still be a tougher, and more expensive, game. (That’s
one reason that I generally recommend buying single bonds only if you plan
to hold them till maturity. I discuss individual bond trading in Chapter 15.)
The changing environment, which has actually thrown many bond brokers
out of business, is due in part to the advent of Internet trading but more so to
something called the Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE), a gov-
ernment and securities industry–imposed national database that allows bond
traders — both professional and amateur — to see what other bond traders
are up to. Brokers can no longer charge whatever markup they wish. See the
sidebar “Peek-a-boo: Bond trades move out of the darkness, into the light” for
more details.
Deciding Whether to Go with Bond 
Funds or Individual Bonds
Before I get into the nitty-gritty of buying and selling bonds (the next two
chapters are nothing but nitty-gritty), you need to make a decision between
individual bonds and bond funds. Thanks to the many recent changes in the
bond markets that I discuss in the previous sections, either choice can be a
good one. My own bias — built on years of experience — is that most
investors are better off, most of the time, with bond funds.
Calculating the advantages of funds
I prefer bond funds for a number of reasons, but far and away the largest
reason is the diversification that bond funds allow.
Diversifying away certain risks
The obvious appeal of going with a bond fund over individual bonds is the
same as the appeal of going with stock funds over individual stocks: You 
get instant diversification. If you build an entire portfolio of McDummy
210
Part IV: Bonds Away! Navigating the Fixed-Income Marketplace 

Corporation bonds (or stocks), and the McDummy Corporation springs a
serious leak, you could take a serious hit on the McChin. With bond funds,
you don’t need to worry so much about the crash of a particular company.
Just as importantly, bond funds allow you to diversify not only by issuer but
by credit quality (you can have AAA-rated bonds and B-rated bonds — see
Chapter 6) and by maturity. Some bond funds allow you to diversify even
more broadly by including completely different kinds of bonds, such as
Treasuries, agencies, and corporates, both U.S. and international.
How much money should you have to invest before you forget about bond
funds and build a truly diversified bond portfolio out of individual bonds?
“We’re talking something in the range of $350,000 to $400,000,” says Chris
Genovese, senior vice president of Fixed Income Securities, or FIS, a nation-
wide firm that provides targeted advice on bond portfolio construction to
investment advisors.
Making investing a lot easier
Sure, you can own a boatload of individual bonds and ladder them (which
means to use a diversification technique I discuss in Chapter 15), but owning
one or a handful of bond mutual or exchange-traded funds is often a lot sim-
pler. Also, given the numbers that Genovese is talking about, most people
don’t have nearly enough money to diversify properly with individual bonds.
Individual bonds are also more work than bond funds.
When you own an individual bond, the interest payments generally come to
you twice a year. If you reinvest that money rather than spend it, you need to
decide how to reinvest. In other words, a portfolio of individual bonds takes
ongoing care and maintenance, sort of like an old car that needs to go to the
shop every few months. Bond funds, in contrast, can be set up to reinvest
automatically and can almost be put on autopilot.
Having choices: Index funds and actively managed funds
If you wish to capture the gains of the entire bond market, bond index funds
allow you to do that. If you want to bet (yes, it is always something of a bet)
that you can do better than the bond market at large, you can hire an active
manager who will try to eke out extra returns for you by looking for special
deals in the bond market.
I believe largely in index investing (for both stocks and bonds) because beat-
ing the market is very hard to do. Study after study shows that index
investors, in both equities and fixed income, wind up doing better than the
vast majority of investors. That’s largely because index funds tend to be the
least expensive funds. Index fund managers take less for themselves, and
they incur far fewer trading costs.
211
Chapter 14: Strategizing Your Bond Buys and Sells

Still, if you put the time and effort into finding the right active bond manager,
and you pay that manager a modest fee, you may wind up ahead of the
indexes. Just know the odds are against it. According to Morningstar, only 28
percent of actively managed bond funds have outperformed the Lehman
Brothers Aggregate Bond Index over the past 15 years, while many of them
take on more risk than the index.
If you wish to try to beat the market using individual bonds, you may be able
to find a really good bond broker who knows the markets inside and out and
will charge you only a reasonable markup for each trade or a reasonable flat
fee for his or her services. Finding such a broker, however, is a lot more diffi-
cult than researching bond-fund managers. And most such talented brokers
aren’t going to work with you if you have chump change to invest.
Keeping your costs to a minimum
For the savvy investor, the cost of trading individual bonds is cheaper than
ever. But so, too, is the cost of investing in bond funds. Treasury bonds can
be bought online (www.treasurydirect.gov) without any kind of fee or
markup. Any other kind of bond, however, will cost you something to trade.
Given the volume that bond fund managers trade, they can often trade
cheaper than you can.
“Institutional buyers can buy and sell bonds and get much better prices than
the retail investor,” says Helen Modly, CFP, executive vice president of Focus
Wealth Management in Middleburg, Virginia. “Because of that, bond funds,
especially bond index exchange-traded funds (ETFs), make a lot of sense.”
If you pay a fund manager a pittance per year (such as the 11/100 of 1 percent
that a Vanguard ETF manager receives), Modly says (and I agree) that you are
nearly always going to get off cheaper with the fund than with building your
own bond ladder.
Note that popular wisdom has it that individual bond investing is cheaper
than investing in bond funds. Don’t buy it. Except perhaps for Treasury
bonds, and maybe sometimes new issues on agency bonds or municipals, the
small investor is unlikely to wind up ahead dealing in individual bonds.
I should add that many buyers of individual bonds often incur one frequently
forgotten cost: the cost of having idle cash. If you collect your semiannual
coupon payments and don’t spend them, they may sit around in a low-
interest money market account. Many of the clients I’ve seen show me their
existing “bond” portfolios, and I immediately notice wads and wads of cash
sitting around earning next to nothing. That doesn’t happen with bond funds,
where the monthly interest can easily be set up to roll right back into the
fund, earning money without pause.

Considering whether individual 
bonds make sense
Individual bonds and bond funds, like politics and money, are even closer
than most people think.
Dispelling the cost myth
People who imagine great differences often say that bond funds are more
expensive than investing in individual bonds. Often untrue. Bond funds’
expenses have traditionally been more visible than the expenses of trading
individual bonds, but overall, funds tend to be less expensive, unless individ-
ual bonds are bought for very large amounts and held till maturity.
Dispelling the predictability myth
There is also a misconception that individual bonds are much more pre-
dictable than bond funds. After all, you get a steady stream of income, and
you know that you are getting your principal back on such-and-such a date.
Technically, these things are true. But they’re more complicated than they
seem.
Say you had all your money in one big, fat bond worth $100,000 with a
coupon rate of 5 percent, maturing in 20 years. You would know that you’d
get a check for $2,500 once every six months and that, in 20 years, you’d get a
final check for $102,500 (your final interest payment, plus your principal
returned).
But that’s not how things work in the real world. In the real world, investors
in individual bonds typically have bonds of varying maturities. As one bond
matures, a younger bond takes its place. Except by rare coincidence, the new
bond will not have the same maturity period or the same coupon rate. So the
argument that the returns on a portfolio of individual bonds are as pre-
dictable as the sunrise is weak.
In addition, consider the effects of inflation. Yes, $100,000 invested in individ-
ual bonds today will be returned to you in 10, 20, or however many years,
depending on the maturity of the bonds. But what will that money be worth
in 10 or 20 years? You simply don’t know. Because of inflation, it could be
worth quite a bit less than the value of $100,000 today. I’m not arguing that
inflation wallops the return on individual bonds any more than it wallops the
return on bond funds; I’m only arguing that the effect of inflation renders final
bond returns kind of mushy — whether we’re talking individual bonds or
bond funds.
213
Chapter 14: Strategizing Your Bond Buys and Sells

To look at it another way, individual bond ladders (which I describe in
Chapter 15) fluctuate — in both interest payments and principal value — just
as bond funds do. So you won’t convince me that individual bonds (except
perhaps for short-term bonds that are not as vulnerable to inflation or inter-
est rate fluctuations) are better than bond funds for reasons of either price or
consistency. But that’s not to say that individual bonds are never the better
choice. They certainly can be, in some cases — most notably, if you plan to
hold them to maturity.
Dispelling the tax myth
This one isn’t so much a myth: The reality is that bond mutual funds can
incur capital gains tax where individual bonds do not. When a fund manager
sells an individual bond for more than he bought it, the fund makes a capital
gain that gets passed onto the shareholders (if there are no offsetting capital
losses). With individual bonds, you never pay a capital gains tax unless you
yourself sell the bond for a profit, which is something you have the option of
doing or not doing.
But while capital gains on stock funds can be very large, capital gains on
bond funds generally aren’t. Most bonds simply don’t appreciate in price
very much. Also, if you are concerned with capital gains on your bond funds,
you can always put them into a tax-advantaged retirement account, and your
capital-gains tax problems disappear. Or, rather than invest in a bond mutual
fund, you can choose a bond exchange-traded fund (ETF), which has a differ-
ent structure than a mutual fund and is able to dodge capital gains tax. Both
ETF investing and putting your bond funds in retirement accounts are strate-
gies that I recommend. I discuss tax-advantaged retirement accounts more in
just a few pages. You’ll find more on ETFs in Chapter 16.
Embracing the true benefits of single bonds
Neither price nor consistency makes individual bonds a better option than
bond funds. What can sometimes make individual bonds a better option is
control. If you absolutely need a certain amount of income, or if you need the
return of principal sometime in the next several years, individual bonds can
make sense. For example:
 If you are buying a house, and you know that you’re going to need
$40,000 in cash in 365 days, buying one-year Treasury bills may be the
best investment you can make.
 If your kid is off to college in two years, and you know that you’ll need
$20,000 a year for four years, then Treasury bills and bonds may be the
ticket. (However, it may make more sense to open a 529 College Plan. See
529 & Other College Savings Plans For Dummies by Margaret A. Munro
[Wiley].)
 If you are comfortably retired and your living expenses are covered by
your pension and Social Security, but you need to pay out $500 twice a
214
Part IV: Bonds Away! Navigating the Fixed-Income Marketplace 

year for property taxes, it may be wise to put away enough in individual
bonds to cover that fixed expense, at least for several years down the
road. (Beyond several years, you can’t be certain what your property
taxes will be.)
 If you are pulling in a sizeable paycheck and find yourself in the upper
tax brackets, and you live in a high-tax city and state, and your reading
of Chapter 8 tells you that investing in triple-tax-free munis makes the
most sense, then a ladder of triple-tax-free munis may be your best port-
folio tool. (Triple-tax-free means free from federal, state, and local tax.)
Individual bonds allow for a precise tailoring of a fixed-income portfolio.
Quite simply, most people don’t need that kind of precision and, therefore,
the advantages of funds usually outweigh the advantages of single bonds.
There are perhaps a few other instances, however, when individual bonds
make sense:
 You meet a bond broker extraordinaire. If you find a bond broker who
is so talented in the ways of bond trading that he or she can do for you
what a bond fund manager can do, only better, then I say go for it. Such
bond brokers are very rare birds, but maybe after reading Chapter 15,
you’ll have the prowess to spot one.
 You plan to become a bond expert. If you yourself intend to make 
such an intense study of bonds that you can serve as your own expert,
researching individual bond issues and issuers to the point that you feel
you have an edge on the market, then individual bonds are for you. My
guess is that because you are reading the words on this page, you, Luke,
have a lot of studying to do before you become a true fixed-income Jedi
warrior.
 You have an inside edge. If you have inside information that allows you
to know that a particular bond is worth more than the market thinks it is
worth, you may take advantage of it by investing in that bond. Of course,
true inside information, such as the information available to directors of
a company, is illegal to take advantage of — in stock trading or bond
trading. And false insider information, the kind of information available
free all over the Internet, is worth every penny you pay for it!
 You plan to spend a lot of time and energy on your portfolio. There
are certain strategies to help juice your returns that you can do with
individual bonds that you can’t do with funds. One strategy, called
rolling down the yield curve, entails holding long-term bonds paying
higher interest until they become intermediate- or short-term bonds,
and then selling them and replacing them with other higher yielding
long-term bonds, until they become intermediate- or short-term bonds.
Such a strategy takes time, energy, a good head for finance, and strong
trading skills.
215
Chapter 14: Strategizing Your Bond Buys and Sells

Is Now the Time to Buy Bonds?
After suggesting a bond portfolio — or any other kind of portfolio — to a new
client, I often hear, “But . . . is now a good time to invest?”
The answer is yes.
Predicting the future of interest rates . . .
yeah, right
With stocks, the big concern people have is usually that the market is about
to tumble. With bonds, the big concern is that interest rates are going to rise,
and any bonds purchased today will wither in value as a result.
But interest rates are almost as unpredictable as the stock market. Yes, the
government has more control over interest rates than it does the stock
market, but it doesn’t have complete control, and the actions it decides to
take or not take are not for you to know.
And furthermore, I would argue that even if you could predict interest 
rates (which you can’t), and even if you did know that they were going to rise
(which you don’t), it still is a good time to buy bonds.
I’m assuming, of course, that you’ve done the proper analysis (see Chapter
12), and you’ve decided that more bonds belong in your portfolio, and you
have cash in hand. What do you do with it? You have three savings/investing
options, really:
 Keep it in cash.
 Invest it in equities.
 Invest it in fixed income.
If you invest in equities (stocks or commodities), you mess with your overall
portfolio structure, making it perhaps too risky. If you keep cash (a savings or
money market account), you earn enough interest to maybe keep up with
inflation — but after taxes, probably not. In either scenario, you lose.
Now suppose you choose to go ahead and buy the bonds. And suppose that
interest rates, as you feared, do rise. That isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Yes,
your bonds or bond funds will take a hit. The value of the bonds or the price
of the bond-fund shares will sink. But in the long run, you shouldn’t suffer,
and you may even benefit from higher interest rates.
216
Part IV: Bonds Away! Navigating the Fixed-Income Marketplace 

After all, every six months with individual bonds, and every month with most
bond funds, you get interest payments, and those interest payments may be
reinvested. The higher the interest rate climbs, the more money you can
make off those reinvestments. Waiting for interest rates to fall — which they
may or may not do — just doesn’t make sense.
Paying too much attention 
to the yield curve
Another difficult decision for bond investors putting in fresh money occurs at
those rare times in history when we see an inverted yield curve. The yield curve
refers to the difference between interest rates on long-term versus short-term
bonds. Normally, long-term bonds pay higher rates of interest. If the yield curve
is inverted, that means the long-term bonds are paying lower rates of interest
than shorter-term bonds. That doesn’t happen often, but it happens. The rea-
sons for the yield curve are many and complex, and they include inflation
expectations, feelings about the economy, and foreign demand for U.S. debt.
Whatever the reasons for an inverted yield curve, it hardly makes sense to tie
up your money in a long-term bond when a shorter-term bond is paying just
as much interest or possibly a slight bit more. Or does it?
Some financial planners would disagree with me on this one, but I am not
averse to investing in long-term bonds even when the yield curve is a slight bit
inverted. Perverted? Nah. Remember that a large reason you are investing in
bonds is to have a cushion if your other investments (such as stocks) take a
nosedive. When stocks plunge, money tends to flow (and flow fast) into
investment-grade bonds, especially Treasuries. Initially, the “rush to safety”
creates the most demand for short-term bonds, and their price will tend
to rise.
Over time, however, a plunge in the stock market often results in the feds
lowering interest rates (in an attempt to kick-start the economy), which lifts
bond prices — especially the price of longer maturity bonds. In other words,
long-term Treasuries are your very best hedge against a stock market crash.
If that hedge is paying a hair less in interest, it may still be worth having it,
rather than shorter-term bonds, in your portfolio.
There’s another reason for investing in long-term bonds, even if they aren’t
paying what short-term bonds are paying. What if interest rates drop, regard-
less of what’s going on in the stock market? Sometimes interest rates fall even
when the stock market is soaring. If that is the case, once again, you may
wish that you were holding long-term bonds, says bond guru Chris Genovese.
217
Chapter 14: Strategizing Your Bond Buys and Sells

“If interest rates are falling when your short-term bonds mature, you may be
forced to reinvest at a lower rate,” he says. “In the context of an entire bond
portfolio, having both short-term and long-term bonds, regardless of the yield
curve, may be advisable.”
Adhering — or not — to 
dollar-cost averaging
Instead of throwing all your money into a bond portfolio right away, some
people say it makes more sense to buy in slowly over a long period of time.
That way, the argument goes, you spread out your risk, buying when the
market is high and when the market is low. And if you invest equal amounts
of money each time, you’ll tend to buy more product (bonds or fund shares)
when the market is low, potentially adding to your bottom line. This
approach to investing is called dollar-cost averaging.
Dollar-cost averaging makes some sense if you are taking freshly earned
money and investing it. If you have a pool of cash, however, it simply doesn’t
make sense. The cash you leave behind will be earning too little for the whole
scheme to make any sense.
If you have a chunk of money waiting to be invested, and you have an invest-
ment plan in place, go for it. Buy those bonds you were planning to buy.
There’s no reason to wait for just the right moment or to buy in dribs and
drabs.
Choosing between Taxable and Tax-
Advantaged Retirement Accounts
In yesteryear, when corporations and municipalities were still offering bearer
bonds — bonds that came with a certificate and were registered nowhere
with no one — you didn’t have to concern yourself with keeping them in any
particular account. You could keep your bearer bonds in your safe, your
glove compartment, or your underwear drawer. Today, it’s a different matter.
Chances are that you have both a taxable account where you can store your
investments and a tax-advantaged account, such as an IRA, a Roth IRA, a
401(k), or a 529 college savings plan. Think of these as containers of sorts,
which you fill up with your various investments.
In which container do you keep your bonds?
218
Part IV: Bonds Away! Navigating the Fixed-Income Marketplace 

Positioning your investments 
for minimal taxation
Say you’re in the 28 percent federal tax bracket. You’ll pay 28 percent tax
(plus state income tax) on any bond interest dividends paid from any bonds
held in a taxable account — except for tax-free municipal bonds. Plain and
simple, tax-advantaged accounts exist to allow you to escape — or at least
postpone — paying income tax on your investment gains. It generally makes
the most sense to keep your taxable income–generating investments, such as
taxable bonds, in your retirement accounts.
Here are some other things to keep in mind:
 Treasury bonds are free from state tax. Therefore, if you have room in
your retirement accounts for only one kind of bond, it makes most sense
for it to be corporate bonds.
219
Chapter 14: Strategizing Your Bond Buys and Sells
Balancing your portfolio with taxes in mind
Suppose you’ve decided that you want a 50/50
portfolio: 50 percent stocks and 50 percent
bonds. Suppose, in addition, that you have both
a taxable brokerage account and an IRA. You’ve
decided to put all your bonds in the IRA, and all
your stocks in your taxable brokerage account.
Do you really have a 50/50 portfolio?
No, probably not. The IRA bond money, when-
ever you decide to tap it, will incur income tax.
The stocks will be taxable as capital gains — in
most cases, 15 percent — only to the extent that
they’ve grown in value.
In other words, $100,000 taken from the stock
portfolio in your brokerage account, assuming
you originally invested $50,000, will incur a tax
of ($50,000 capital gain x 15 percent) $7,500. But
$100,000 taken from the bond portfolio in your
IRA may incur a tax (assuming you are in the 
28 percent tax bracket) of $28,000.
As you can see, your IRA portfolio is worth con-
siderably less (in this case, about 22 percent
less) than the same amount of money in your
taxable account.
If you are more than five years from tapping
your nest egg, don’t concern yourself too much
with this discrepancy. You don’t yet know what
your income tax rate or the capital gains rate
will be when you start to withdraw from your
savings. Nor can you predict very well the
appreciation you’ll enjoy in your various
accounts. But as you approach retirement, or if
you are already in the “disbursement” phase of
your investor life, it makes sense to factor this
tax differential into your portfolio allocation.
In the example above, a true, after-tax, 50/50
portfolio might actually have 22 percent more
bonds than stocks.

 Foreign bonds often require the paying of foreign tax, which will usually
be reimbursed to you by Uncle Sam, but only if those bonds are kept in a
taxable account.
 Municipal bonds, usually free from federal tax, always belong in your
taxable accounts.
Figure 14-1 illustrates where you want to keep your bond holdings.
Factoring in the early-withdrawal 
penalties and such
Keep in mind that any money withdrawn from an IRA, 401(k), or SEP (self-
employed pension) prior to age 591⁄2, except under certain special circum-
stances, is subject to a 10 percent penalty. (Income tax must be paid regardless
of when you withdraw.) So any bonds you are planning to cash out prior to that
age should not be put into your retirement account.
On the flip side, at age 701⁄2, you must start taking minimum required distribu-
tions from most retirement accounts. That should be figured into your alloca-
tion decisions, as well. If your minimum required distributions — the amount
the IRS requires you to pull from your account each year after age 701⁄2 — are
substantial, it can mess with your balance of investments.
As I discuss more in Chapter 18, Roth IRAs are different animals. There is no
tax to pay when you withdraw, and you are not required to withdraw at any
particular age. The money grows and grows, tax-free, potentially forever.
Imagine. Had Vasco da Gama in 1497 invested a mere $1 in a bond fund that
paid 5 percent a year, and if he had held it in a Roth IRA, that $1 would now
be worth $64,053,449,900. Think of all the spices that could buy!

That ye have made to me as herebeforn,
Since thilke time that ye were born.
Have here my truth, I shall you ne’er repreve.
— Geoffrey Chaucer, The Canterbury Tales, 14th century
U
nless you have a Ph.D. in medieval literature, or you’re 620 years old,
you probably have no more idea what those words mean than I do. 
(I chose the particular passage above simply because it has the word bond in
it, although I don’t think it has anything to do with finances.) In any case, I’m
afraid that Chaucer has become a bit moldy with age.
Alas, I may come to know the same fate. By the time you read these words,
this very chapter may well seem antiquated. That’s how rapidly the world of
individual bond trading is changing.
Ne’rtheless, um, nevertheless, in this chapter I do my best to get you up to
current speed. And, should the tales I tell become faded by time, fear not: I
give you a few online resources so that with the tap of a few keys and the click
of a mouse, you can access the most modern methods — the most efficient,
friendly, and profitable methods — for buying and selling individual bonds.

Understanding Today’s Individual 
Bond Market
You don’t pay commissions when you trade individual bonds, as you do
when you trade stocks. Instead, bond trading has traditionally been done by
someone, usually in a fancy suit, called a broker. A broker buys a bond at one
price and sells it at a higher price. The difference, known as the bid/ask
spread, is what the broker brings home. We’re sometimes talking lots of bacon
here. The bid/ask spreads on bonds can sometimes be big enough to make
the commissions paid on stocks look like greyhound fat.
Once upon a time, and for many decades, commissions on stocks were as fat
as spreads on bonds, sometimes fatter. That began to change shortly after
Mary Tyler Moore moved to Minneapolis. (Historians believe the connection
is only coincidental.)
In 1975, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) deregulated the stock
markets, allowing for open competition and discount brokerage houses. That
paved the way for Internet trading, and within a few short years, the money
that most people spent to make a stock trade was reduced to a fraction of
what it had been. In the 1970s, a typical stock trade cost $100 (about $400 in
today’s dollars). Today, a stock trade may cost as little as $5, and rarely more
than $20.
And how has bond trading changed since 1975? It’s changed. But it’s changed
like men’s fashions change — not women’s. You have to look hard to notice
the differences.
Getting some welcome transparency
Bond trading today is, in a sense, about where stock trading was in the early
1980s. You can still spend $300, $400, or way more on the cost of a single
trade. But you shouldn’t have to anymore. Thanks to a system called the
Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE), bond trading is becoming a
bit more like stock trading.
TRACE is a system run by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)
that can be accessed through many financial Web sites.
Because of TRACE, bond trading no longer has to be a muddied affair in
which individual investors are at the mercy of brokers. This system ensures
that every corporate bond trade in the United States is reported, and the
details appear on the Web. (The Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board runs
a similar system for municipal bonds.)
222
Part IV: Bonds Away! Navigating the Fixed-Income Marketplace 

TRACE ensures that trading costs are no longer hidden, bond yields (greatly
affected by the bid/ask spreads) are easy to find, and good information is avail-
able. Among investment people, access to information is generally referred to
as transparency. TRACE provides some pretty amazing transparency.
Unfortunately, not everyone knows about the TRACE system, so not every-
one realizes that she can find out (for free) the price a broker paid for a bond.
In fact, lots of people don’t know. The world today is divided more or less
evenly, I’d say, between those who know about TRACE and those who don’t.
Those who don’t pay a heavy price.
Ushering in a new beginning
The new transparency, ushered into practice between 2002 and 2005, has
removed much of the mystery from bond trading. You can now go online and,
provided your Windows system doesn’t crash that particular day, quickly get
a pretty good idea of how much a single bond is being bought and sold for —
by brokers, institutions, and individuals. You’ll also see how far a broker —
your broker — is trying to mark a bond up, and exactly what yield you’ll get
after the middleman and all his cousins have taken their cuts, should you
purchase that bond.
Unfortunately, the cuts taken on bond trades still tend to be too high, and
you can’t (except in rare circumstances) bypass the middlemen. But with
some tough negotiating on your part, you won’t make them terribly rich at
your expense, either.
Dealing with Brokers and Other
Financial Professionals
As I say elsewhere in this book, you are probably better off investing in bond
funds (see Chapter 16) rather than individual bonds unless you have a bond
portfolio of $350,000 or so. It’s hard to build a diversified bond portfolio —
diversified by type of bond, issuer, and maturity — unless you have that
amount to work with. It’s also hard to negotiate good prices on bonds when
you’re dealing with amounts that brokers tend to sneeze at.
Investing in individual bonds also requires substantially more work than
investing in bond funds. With individual bonds, you not only have to haggle,
but you need to haggle again and again. After all, with individual bonds, you
get interest payments on a regular basis, usually every six months. Unless
you spend the money right away, you need to concern yourself with con-
stantly reinvesting those interest payments. It can be a real job.
223
Chapter 15: Investing (Carefully!) in Individual Bonds

Then there’s the risk of default. With Treasuries, there is (said to be) no risk
of default, and with agency bonds and munis, the risk is minimal. With corpo-
rate bonds, however, the risk of a company losing its ability to pay you back
is very real. Even when corporations don’t default, their bonds may be down-
graded by the major rating agencies. That can mean a loss of money, too, if
you decide that you can’t hold a bond till maturity. Don’t start dabbling in
individual corporate bonds unless you are willing to put in some serious time
and effort doing research.
With these caveats in mind, the first thing you need in order to be an investor
in individual bonds is a dealer: someone or some institution that is going to
place the actual trades for you — without robbing you blind or steering your
astray.
Identifying the role of the middleman
Most bond dealers are brokers who buy a bond from Client A at one price, sell
it to Client B at another, leave the office for a few rounds of golf, and then
come back to harvest more profits. Sorry, I hate to be cynical, but the money
some of these Brooks Brothers cowboys make at investors’ expense is truly
shameful.
Some bond brokers are very knowledgeable about fixed-income investing and
can help walk you through the maze, making good suggestions for your port-
folio. Some are very talented at finding the best buys in bonds and using 
certain sophisticated strategies to juice your fixed-income returns.
Unfortunately, the way brokers are paid creates a system where the tradi-
tional broker’s financial interests are in opposition to the interests of his
clients. The more the broker makes, the less the client keeps. The more the
client keeps, the less the broker makes. The more the broker can get you to
flip, or trade one bond for another, the more the broker makes. Generally, the
more you flip, the less likely you are to come out ahead.
I don’t wish to say that brokers are bad people, or greedy people . . . no more
so than car salesmen are bad or greedy people. I’m only saying that bond
brokers are salespeople (some of them fabulously paid salespeople) and
need to be seen as such.
Like the car salesman, the bond broker who acts as principal (taking ownership
of the bond) is not required to reveal what kind of markup he or she is making.
And you won’t find this information in Consumer Reports. (Fortunately, though,
you can find it on TRACE; see the section “Getting some welcome transparency”
earlier in the chapter.)
224
Part IV: Bonds Away! Navigating the Fixed-Income Marketplace 

Some bond dealers today work as agents and charge you a flat fee, an hourly
rate, a certain amount per trade, or a percentage of assets under manage-
ment. A good agent, like a good broker, may know enough about the ins and
outs of bonds to help you make the best selections and get the best prices.
Agents, unlike principals, do have to reveal exactly what they are charging
you. Alas, whereas an agent is generally better to deal with than a broker
(simply because there’s no conflict of financial interests), a good one is very
hard to find. And even if you do find one, agents often must work with bro-
kers to get trades done.
Do you need a broker or agent at all?
You don’t need a broker or agent to buy Treasury bonds. You can do so easily
and without any markup on www.treasurydirect.gov. You can usually get
savings bonds at your local savings bank for no fee.
Municipal bonds and corporate bonds must be purchased through an inter-
mediary; you can’t buy these securities directly from the issuers. Sure, you
can loan your neighbor or brother-in-law $1,000 and demand the money back
with interest (good luck!), and that’s a bond, of sorts. But if you want to buy
and sell marketable fixed-income securities, you must go through a recog-
nized agent.
225
Chapter 15: Investing (Carefully!) in Individual Bonds
The author’s prediction for the future 
of bond trading
Some day — I’m not sure when, but some 
day — bond brokers will disappear. You want to
buy a Spacely Space Sprockets ten-year bond
maturing in 2040? You’ll get an identifying code
for the bond (perhaps the CUSIP, which I dis-
cuss in another sidebar in this chapter), and
you’ll put it in a Web site (something that resem-
bles www.kayak.com, which currently exists
for travel deals). People and institutions will
offer to sell you their bonds, and you’ll be free
to pay the lowest price. Want to sell a Spacely
Space Sprockets ten-year bond maturing in
2042? You’ll advertise it on the same Web site,
and people and institutions will bid. You’ll take
the highest price you can get.
Alternatively, bonds may wind up trading more
like stocks. Instead of a bunch of brokers shout-
ing deals to each other on the telephone, as
happens today, bonds will be offered on an
open exchange, similar to NASDAQ. Financial
supermarkets will begin to allow for conditional
trades, just as they have recently begun to offer
with stocks. You want a ten-year bond with an 
A rating, paying at least 324 percent? (Interest
rates are higher in the future!) You’ll put the
offer into your computer, and it can apply to any
number of bond issues. The first to meet the 
criteria will nail the sale.

Going through a financial supermarket, such as a Fidelity, T. Rowe Price, or
Vanguard, is (generally) cheaper than going through a full-service, markup
kind of broker. The supermarket’s pricing, which is a concession or a fee
(more or less), not a markup, is perhaps more clean-cut. But the supermarket
agents generally hold your hand only so much, and they won’t make actual
bond selections for you the way a full-service broker will.
You’ll note that I inject some qualifiers in the previous paragraph, such as
“generally” and “perhaps.” I explain why in the upcoming section “Doing It
Yourself Online,” where I discuss online bond trading. The financial super-
markets often make their way of trading sound easier, cheaper, and more
transparent than it really is.
Selecting the right broker or agent
Whether you go with a full-service, markup kind of broker or with an agent, I
would ask you to do a few things:
 Find someone who truly specializes in bonds — preferably the kind
you’re looking to buy. If you needed hand surgery, you wouldn’t go to a
gastroenterologist, would you? If your dealing in individual bonds is
going to be any more profitable than, say, investing in a bond index fund,
you need a broker or agent who truly knows the ins and outs, tracks the
markets carefully, and can jump on a good deal. You don’t want a broker
who deals in bonds, stocks, gold coins, and collector art!
Start by asking people you know and respect for referrals. Make calls.
Ask lots of questions about a broker’s background, including academic
and professional history. Ask for client recommendations. Don’t be shy.
Ask for numbers: What kind of return figures has this broker been able
to garner for clients, and taking what kinds of risks?
 Be on guard. Always. Whenever you find a broker and agree to buy or
sell individual bonds, be certain that you aren’t paying an excessive
markup. Although different people in the investment business have dif-
ferent concepts of what constitutes “excessive,” if you’re asked to cough
up the equivalent of more than three months’ interest, that’s excessive,
in my humble opinion. Other financial types have their opinions. See the
sidebar “Defining ‘excessive’ in bond markups” later in the chapter.
 Know a broker’s limitations. Most bond brokers I’ve known are not the
best people to build your entire portfolio. They often have limited
knowledge of investments beyond bonds. (And that’s probably a good
thing — see the first bullet in this list.) If they deal in stocks at all, they
often deal in pricy stock mutual funds that you don’t want — the kind
that will earn them a nice commission.

Checking the broker’s numbers
In a page or two, I discuss online bond trading. If you deal with a full-service
broker, you won’t have to know the complete ins and outs of trading bonds
online. But I would still urge you, at a minimum, to become familiar with
www.investinginbonds.com (the Web site of the Securities Industry and
Financial Markets Association) and www.finra.org (the Web site of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority). On these Web sites, you can plug in
information on any bond — either by the name of the issuer or the bond’s
CUSIP — and you’ll experience the type of transparency I discuss earlier in
this chapter. (If you don’t know what a CUSIP is, see the nearby sidebar
“What the heck is a CUSIP, anyway?”)
On www.investinginbonds.com, click on See Municipal Market At-A-Glance
or See Corporate Bond Market At-A-Glance, and then enter the CUSIP number
at the bottom of the first page that pops up, under where it says “Bond
History.” On www.finra.org . . . well, just as this book is going the press,
FINRA is planning a major overhaul of its Web site, so you may need to poke
around a bit. I’ve been assured that the new Web site will be user-friendly.
You can see on these Web sites how much the bond recently sold for (if it has
sold recently), how many bonds have recently been traded, and the bond’s
current yield and yield-to-maturity (see Chapter 4). You can plug in the price
the bond dealer is offering you (which includes his markup) and see if the
yield still makes sense given the yield of similar bonds.
Figure 15-1 shows the recent trading history of an everyday bond (from the
pharmaceutical company Merck) as seen at www.investinginbonds.com.
You can see the price paid for this bond and the resulting yield. This gives
you a pretty good idea of what you should be getting, should you wish to buy
or sell . . . provided the particular bond you’re interested in has seen recent
action.
227
Chapter 15: Investing (Carefully!) in Individual Bonds
What the heck is a CUSIP, anyway?
All bonds have a CUSIP that identifies the bond
in the same way that a license plate identifies 
a vehicle. CUSIP stands for Committee on
Uniform Securities Identification Procedures,
which is a part of the American Bankers
Association. Although it’s often referred to as a
CUSIP number, that is something of a misnomer
because a CUSIP typically contains both letters
and numbers. The first six characters of the
CUSIP identify the issuer, the next two charac-
ters identify the issue itself, and the ninth digit
is called a check digit, its sole purpose to make
computer readers happy. Here’s a CUSIP for a
General Electric bond: 36966RXR2. Here’s one
for a Fannie Mae bond: 31396CVP2.

If you click on Run Calculations, you get something that looks like Figure 15-2.
To get a bird’s-eye view of the bond market, go to Yahoo! Finance at http://
finance.yahoo.com/bonds/composite_bond_rates. The chart you find
there gives you a pretty good idea of what various categories of bonds are
paying on any particular day. If you’re in the market for a bond, compare the
composite yield to the yield you’re being offered. If you aren’t being offered
at least as much as the average yield, ask why. The Yesterday, Last Week, and
Last Month columns show you which way bond yields are headed. But
remember that yield trends, just like the wins and losses of your favorite
sports team, can reverse direction quickly.

Hiring a financial planner
Lots of people today, including stock and bond brokers, call themselves
financial planners. I suggest that if you hire a financial planner, you seriously
consider a fee-only planner, who takes no commissions and works only for
you. To find one in your area, contact the National Association of Personal
Financial Advisors (NAPFA) at 800-366-2732, or go online to www.napfa.org.
(I’m a member of NAPFA.)
Some NAPFA-certified financial advisors will work with you on an hourly
basis. Others will want to take your assets under management. Know that if
you hire a financial planner who takes your assets under management, you
will typically pay a fee, usually 0.30 to 1.0 percent a year. I think 0.50 percent
is plenty; you shouldn’t pay more than that unless you’re getting help from
that planner that extends to insurance, estate planning, and other matters
beyond investing.
If you have a sizeable bond portfolio, a fee-only financial planner who is trad-
ing bonds for you can potentially save you enough money to compensate for
his or her fee. Even though the planner will be dealing with a broker, just as
you would, planners with numerous clients can bundle their bond purchases,
so the broker will often settle for a substantially lesser markup.
Here’s an example of this type of savings. Matthew Reznik, a NAPFA-certified
financial planner with Balasa Dinverno & Foltz LLC of Itasca, Illinois, explains
that “If an individual investor is buying a $25,000 bond for his or her portfo-
lio, the spread can be as high as 2.25 percent. If that bond is yielding 5 per-
cent, that’s a pretty big haircut. If we buy bonds, we buy the same issue in a
$1 million piece. In that case the spread would be reduced to 0.10 percent.”
Fee-only financial planners may also have access to certain institutional-like
(frugal and possibly superior) bond funds that you wouldn’t have access to
otherwise, should you decide to go the bond-fund route.
230

Looking into a broker’s record
If you want to make sure that the bond broker
you hire isn’t going to take your money and buy
a one-way ticket to Rio the next morning, check
his or her background before you hand over the
check. You can get information on the discipli-
nary record, professional background, and reg-
istration and license status of any properly
registered broker or brokerage firm by using
FINRA BrokerCheck. FINRA makes BrokerCheck
available at no charge to the public. Investors
can access this service by linking directly 
to BrokerCheck at www.finra.org or by
calling 800-289-9999.

Doing It Yourself Online
A growing number of financial supermarkets and specialty bond shops now
allow you to trade bonds online, and they advertise that they’ll do it for a
fixed price.
In the case of Fidelity, the supermarket with which I am most familiar, the
price to trade a Treasury bond is 50 cents. The price for a municipal bond is
$1.50. And the price for a corporate bond is $2.00.
Whoa, you might say. That’s a great deal! Well, yes and no. If that were all that
Fidelity and the other middlemen were making, it would be a great deal. But
what you see and what you get are two different things. The “flat fees” quoted
by Fidelity and its competitors are a bit misleading.
“The idea that there are no broker markups is not the case,” says financial
planner Matthew Reznik. “No matter who sells you a bond, there is always 
a spread built in to compensate the broker.” In other words, Fidelity or
Vanguard or whomever may charge you “only $1.50 to trade a bond,” but the
price you get for your bond, to buy or sell, is marked up from the price that
someone else just got to sell or buy. Your particular broker may have marked
up the bond itself, or some other broker may have done so. Just don’t kid
yourself into thinking that $1.50 is all you’re paying to trade. It ain’t the case.
Proceeding with care
I’ve traded a good number of bonds online with Fidelity. The trading process
there is similar to other financial supermarkets that offer “flat-fee” bond
shopping. I explain how it works in a moment. First, I want to let you know
that, yes, you can get good buys on bonds online, but you can also get
zapped hard. I’ve talked to many other investment pros who have had very
similar experiences at other financial supermarkets, such as Vanguard and
Schwab.
You are most likely to get a fair deal online when you’re buying a bond and
dealing in large quantities. You are most likely to get zapped when you’re 
selling a bond prior to maturity, especially if you’re selling a small number of
bonds and if those particular bonds are traded infrequently. In such cases,
you may let go of your bonds for one price and (using TRACE) find out that
they were sold seconds afterward for 3 percent (or more) higher than the
price you just got. Someone is making very quick money in that situation, and
it isn’t you.
231
Chapter 15: Investing (Carefully!) in Individual Bonds

Knowing the cyber-ropes
Here’s how online trading generally works.
If you’re looking to buy
You first choose a bond category: Do you want a Treasury bond, an agency
bond, a corporate bond, or a municipal bond? (For reminders about each 
category, see Part II of this book.) What kind of rating are you looking for?
What kind of maturity? What kind of yield? (Chapter 4 contains the goods on
ratings, maturity, and yield.)
Most online bond shops walk you through this process step by step; it isn’t
that hard. The most difficult piece of the process, and the one I most want to
help you with, is making sure that after you know what kind of bond you
want, you get the best deal purchasing it.
Here’s what I mean by the best deal for a given type and quality of bond,
plain and simple: You want the highest yield. The yield reflects whatever con-
cession you are paying the financial supermarket, and it reflects whatever
markup you are paying a broker. Keep in mind that most callable bonds do
get called — despite any contrary messages you’ve ever heard from a broker.
So when weighing yields of callable bonds, look at the yield-to-call, and ignore
just about everything else.
A somewhat more subtle yield concept is yield-to-worst (or worst-case basis
yield): the lower of yield-to-call or yield-to-maturity. Whatever that yield is,
that’s what you’re going to get, so you may as well factor that into your bond
purchase decisions.
If two comparable bonds — comparable in maturity, ratings, and every other
way — are offering yields of 5 percent and 5.1 percent, go with the 5.1 per-
cent bond. Just make sure you’ve done your homework so you know that the
two bonds are truly comparable.
Fidelity has a neat tool on its Web site called the scatter graph; it allows you to
see a whole bunch of similar bonds on the same graph, and what kind of yield
each is paying. You can access it at www.fidelity.com. Click on Investment
Products and then Fixed Income. Get into Individual Bonds and then select
the type of bond you’re interested in purchasing. Enter your parameters to
create the scattergraph you need.
To reiterate: The yield reflects the middleman’s cut. Focus on the yield to get
the best deal. Don’t over-concern yourself with the bid/ask spread on the
bond.
232
Part IV: Bonds Away! Navigating the Fixed-Income Marketplace 

When you go to place your order, use the “Limit Yield” option. You are telling
the brokers on the Fidelity network that you’ll buy this bond only if it yields,
say, 5.1 percent. Anything less, and you aren’t interested. If you put in a
“Market” order on a bond, you can get chewed up — don’t do it.
If you’re looking to sell
Selling bonds online can be much trickier business. You have a particular
bond you want to dump, and the market may or may not want it.
At Fidelity, you are best off calling a Fidelity fixed-income trader and asking
that trader to give you a handle on what the bond is worth. You can then go
online, place a “Limit Price” order to sell, and you’ll very likely get what the
Fidelity trader told you you’d get. But here’s the catch: Fidelity itself may
wind up buying your bond and selling it to someone else at a large markup. 
I asked a Fidelity supervisor if perhaps Fidelity couldn’t be a better advocate
for its clients if Fidelity itself didn’t bid on the bonds, and what I got in
response was a wee bit Orwellian. The answer is yes. Fidelity could be a
better advocate for its clients if it weren’t also dealing in the bonds its clients
are trading. So be it.
Truth be told, you are likely to pay a high markup anywhere if you sell a bond
before its maturity. Charles Schwab is similar to Fidelity in that you tend to
pay through the nose when selling, says Dalibor Nenadov, a fee-only financial
planner with Northern Financial Advisors in Franklin, Michigan. “The bottom
line for the average middle class investor is to build a bond ladder, and hold
until maturity. Don’t sell before maturity, and don’t try to time rates,” he says.
233
Chapter 15: Investing (Carefully!) in Individual Bonds
Saving money with a full-service broker?
Many people assume that discount and online
brokers allow you to trade bonds more cheaply
than with full-service brokers, and that can be
true sometimes. But it isn’t always the case.
Kevin Olson, former municipal bond trader for
Paine Webber and Bank of America, and the
creator of www.municipalbonds.com,
says that “Full-service brokers may offer you
the best deals on new issues of municipal
bonds, especially in those cases where the full-
service broker is itself underwriting the bond.”
If you’re going to trade individual munis, Olson
suggests having a number of accounts with dif-
ferent brokers, including both discount and full-
service brokers. Sometimes, he says, you’ll be
surprised where you get the best deals. That’s
true both for new issues of bonds and for the
secondary market.

Perfecting the Art of Laddering
Bond laddering is a fancy term for diversifying your bond portfolio by matu-
rity. Buy one bond that matures in two years, another that matures in five,
and a third that matures in ten, and — presto! — you have just constructed a
bond ladder (see Figure 15-3).
Why bother? Why not simply buy one big, fat bond that matures in 30 years
and will kick out regular, predictable coupon payments between now and
then? There are a few reasons laddering makes more sense.
Protecting you from interest-rate flux
The first rationale behind laddering is to temper interest-rate risk. If you buy
a 30-year bond right now that pays 5.5 percent, and if interest rates climb
over the next year to 7.5 percent, and stay there, you are going to be eating
stewed crow for 29 more years with your relatively paltry interest payments
of 5.5 percent. Obviously, you don’t want that. (You could always sell your 
30-year bond paying 5.5 percent, but if interest rates pop to 7.5 percent, the
price you would get for your bond would likely be about 70 cents on the
dollar you paid for it.)

Of course, you don’t have to buy a 30-year bond right now. You could buy a
big, fat two-year bond. The problem with doing that is twofold:
 You won’t get as much interest on the two-year bond as you would on
the 30-year bond.
 You are subjecting yourself to reinvestment risk: If interest rates fall over
the next two years, you may not be able to reinvest your principal in two
years for as much as you are getting today.
If you ladder your bonds, you shield yourself to a certain degree from interest
rates rising and falling. If you’re going to invest in individual bonds, laddering
is really the only option. Do it. Do it!
235
Chapter 15: Investing (Carefully!) in Individual Bonds
Defining “excessive” in bond markups
You buy a bond from a broker. You pay $10,000.
The broker bought the bond that morning for
$9,700. You sell a bond. You get $10,000. You do
your research and discover that the broker you
sold it to then turns around and sells it for
$10,300. Are these fair spreads, or are they
excessive?
“There’s no hard and fast rule,” explains Chris
Genovese, senior vice president of Fixed
Income Securities, a nationwide firm that pro-
vides targeted advice on bond portfolio con-
struction to investment advisors. “As far as
what is excessive, spreads tend to get bigger
when you are dealing in high-yield bonds, long-
term bonds, thinly traded bonds, and small lots.
Deciding on what is an excessive spread really
depends on the transaction,” he says. “In my
opinion, any spread larger than 4 percent cer-
tainly warrants at least a phone call back to the
broker for an explanation. I can think of few
instances where a spread of 4 percent would be
justified.”
And what if you call your broker and don’t get a
satisfactory explanation? “Charges — markups
or markdowns — for bond trades must be `fair
and reasonable,’” says Richard Wallace, vice
president of market regulation for the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). “What
constitutes fair and reasonable will change with
the nature of the trade, including the kind of
bond, the number of bonds traded, and so on.
But certainly any markup above 5 percent
should be questioned. If you don’t get a satis-
factory answer as to why you were charged
what you were charged, file a complaint with
regulators,” says Wallace.
FINRA serves as a sort of bond police force. If
you wish to make a complaint, go to www.
finra.org, click on Contact Us , and then
File a Complaint. If you prefer a slightly gentler
approach, you can also have your dispute
resolved by an arbitration panel. You can get
that process going by also logging onto the
FINRA Web site and clicking on the Arbitration
and Mediation tab on the home page.

Tinkering with your time frame
Note that as each bond in your ladder matures, you would typically replace it
with a bond equal to the longest maturity in your portfolio. For example, if
you have a two-year, a five-year, and a ten-year bond, when the two-year bond
matures, you replace it with a ten-year bond. Why? Because your five-year
and ten-year bonds are now two years closer to maturity, so the average
weighted maturity of the portfolio will remain the same: 5.6 years.
Of course, over the course of two years, your economic circumstances may
change, so you may want to tinker with the average weighted maturity. That
depends on your need for return and your tolerance for risk: topics I discuss
in Part I.
A perfectly acceptable (and often preferable) alternative to bond laddering is
to buy a bond mutual fund. This option is the heart of Chapter 16. But
whether you ladder your bonds or you buy a bond fund, I would caution you
that relying only on fixed income to fund your retirement is probably not the
wisest path. You should have a bond ladder or bond mutual funds and other
investments (equity investments) as well. I discuss this subject fully in Part V.

W
hen I was 11, I found a fan belt in the street, undoubtedly fallen from
some car engine. I wiped the grease and dirt off on my T-shirt, and
claimed the 9-inch diameter oval piece of rubber as my prize. One of the
other boys in the neighborhood, Brian Callahan, decided that he wanted it as
his prize. So he lunged at me, grabbed the belt, and started to pull. I pulled
back. He slugged me. About a dozen other boys were looking on, so what
could I do? I returned the punch. Next thing, the two of us were rolling
around in the middle of the busy street, cars hurtling by. One of us, or both of
us, might have been killed.
Was it worth risking life itself for a piece of old rubber?
Yup.
In the eyes of an 11-year-old boy, at least in the neighborhood I grew up in,
getting run over by a two-ton vehicle was clearly preferable to being labeled 
a wimp.

And so it is with some bond investors. They cling to the notion that if you hire
a fund manager, you are something of a wimp. They’d rather get run over trad-
ing individual bonds. That is somehow more manly, more intelligent, more
sophisticated than buying a bond fund — despite all evidence to the contrary.
Yes, even armed with the valuable tips I provide in the previous chapter, a
small investor in individual bonds can wind up with tire treads on his back.
I know bonds . . . and I know dumb. I actually have a 40-year-old fan belt in
the memorabilia box in my closet (no kidding!) to prove it. So trust me on
this: For the vast majority of individual investors, funds are the way to go.
There’s nothing wimpy about them, and provided you do your homework,
they can be as intelligent and sophisticated an investment vehicle as you’ll
ever find. (Index funds, seen by some as the wimpiest things under the sky,
turn out to be mighty tough themselves.)
In this chapter, I introduce you to the many kinds of bond funds — index,
active, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and unit investment trusts —
and reveal that although none are worth dying for, some may well be worth
fighting for.
Defining the Basic Kinds of Funds
With more than 2,000 bond funds to choose from, each representing a differ-
ent basket of bonds, where do you start? That part is actually easy: You start
with the kind of bonds you want to own. Treasuries? Corporate bonds?
Munis? Long-term? Short-term? Investment-grade? High-yield? A blend of all
of the above? The chapters in Part II of this book can help you answer that
question. But knowing what kind of bonds you want in the basket isn’t
enough. You also need to know what kind of basket you want.
Bond funds come in four varieties:
 Open-end mutual funds, typically referred to simply as mutual funds, are
far and away the most common.
 Closed-end mutual funds, usually referred to only as closed-end funds, are
second most common.
 Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are the new kids on the block, catching
on quickly — for good reason.
 Unit investment trusts are not well known but perhaps worth knowing.
Table 16-1 offers an overview of how these types of funds compare. In the 
following sections, I provide the details.

Mining a multitude of mutual funds
When most investors speak of funds, they’re talking about mutual funds. And
no wonder. According to Morningstar, the total number of distinct mutual
funds (ignoring different share classes of certain mutual funds) clocks in at an
astounding 6,593. Of those 6,593 funds, 1,773 of them — nearly 27 percent —
are bond mutual funds.
Like all funds, a mutual fund represents a basket of securities. You, as the
investor, pay the mutual fund company a yearly fee and sometimes a sales
charge (called a load) to buy the fund. In exchange for your money, the
mutual fund company offers you an instant portfolio with professional 
management.
Most mutual funds are open-end funds. This means that there is no limited
number of shares. Within reason, as many people who want to buy into the
fund can buy into the fund. As more people buy into the fund, more bonds
are purchased. The mutual fund shares then sell at a price that directly
reflects the price of all the bonds held by the mutual fund. The interest you
receive from the fund is a pro-rata portion of the total interest received by all
the bonds in the basket.
Mutual fund orders can be placed at any time, but they are priced only at 
the end of the day (4 p.m. on Wall Street), and that is the price you’re going 
to get.
239
Chapter 16: Picking a Bond Fund That Will Serve You for Life

Most mutual funds are actively managed, which means that the managers try
to beat the market by picking certain investments or timing the markets.
Other mutual funds are passively run, or indexed, which means they are set
up to track standard indexes. Index funds tend to cost you a lot less in fees
than actively managed funds. Which are better? See the sidebar “Choosing
between active mutual funds and passive (index) funds” for my thoughts.
240
Part IV: Bonds Away! Navigating the Fixed-Income Marketplace 
Choosing between active mutual funds and 
passive (index) funds
One of the hottest debates among investors —
one that will never end! — is whether actively
managed investments are any wiser than index
fund investments. I’m a huge proponent of
index funds. The vast majority of index
investors — and I am primarily an index
investor — do better than the vast majority of
active investors. Although various studies
show various results, I know of none that con-
tradicts this basic premise that indexing works,
and works very well.
When we look at bond funds specifically, how-
ever, things get a bit muddled. On one hand,
bond index funds are way cheaper than actively
managed bond funds, just as stock index funds
are cheaper than actively managed stock funds.
But because bond funds tend to yield much
more modest returns, costs are more important.
A fund made up of bonds yielding an average of
5 percent that costs 1 percent to hold suddenly
yields 4 percent; that’s a difference in your
return of one-fifth.
But there’s another side to the story, explains
Matthew Gelfand, Ph.D., CFA, CFP, and manag-
ing director and chief investment officer with
Lynx Investment Advisory, LLC, of Washington,
D.C. Despite the cost/yield equation, which
Gelfand doesn’t deny for a second is very impor-
tant, he argues that active management of bonds
makes more sense than active management of
stocks. In fact, it makes perfect sense, says
Gelfand, because bonds are so much more com-
plicated than stocks.
“There are many, many more bonds and kinds
of bonds than there are stocks on the market,”
says Gelfand. “The analyst coverage is much
more sparse. The trading is done mostly over-
the-counter. And the spreads can be very large.
All this makes for a less ‘efficient’ market, and
allows for good active managers to add real
value,” he says. “If you can find a reasonably
priced, well-managed active bond fund, go 
for it.”
I agree. There’s certainly nothing wrong with
passively managed (index) bond mutual funds
or exchange-traded funds. In fact, Gelfand and
I agree that they can, and often do, make excel-
lent investments. Still, handpicking the right
actively managed bond fund can potentially
juice the returns of your portfolio, with limited
additional risk. See the last part of this chapter
for some of my favorite funds of both flavors,
active and indexed.
Note that certain kinds of bonds, namely
muncipals and foreign bonds, have yet to see
any indexed options, so in these categories, you
have no choice but to go with an actively man-
aged fund.

Regardless of whether you go with active or passive, choose only those bond
mutual funds that have solid track records over several years and are reason-
ably priced. The average yearly operating expense of a bond mutual fund, per
Morningstar, is 1.08 percent. Because total return on bond funds, over time,
tends to be much less than that of stock funds, the cost ratio is a bigger
factor. I wouldn’t touch anything over 1.0 percent. There’s little need to buy
more expensive funds; there are many inexpensive alternatives to choose
from, and they tend to offer better performance.
Considering the alternative: 
Closed-end funds
Although most mutual funds are open-ended, some are not. These closed-
end funds are a universe unto themselves. Unlike open-end funds, closed-end
funds have a finite number of shares. The price of the fund does not directly
reflect the value of the securities within the fund. Nor does the yield directly
reflect the yield of the bonds in the basket. In investment-speak, the net asset
value (NAV) of the fund, or the price of the securities within the fund, may
differ significantly from the price of the fund itself.
Supply and demand for a closed-end fund may have more bearing on its price
than the actual securities it holds. Closed-end funds tend to have high man-
agement fees (almost always more than 1 percent a year), and they tend to be
more volatile than open-end funds. Closed-end funds are traded like stocks
(yes, even the bond closed-end funds), and they trade throughout the day.
You buy and sell them through any brokerage house — not directly from the
mutual fund company, as you can do with most mutual funds.
All closed-end funds are actively managed. There are 649 closed-end funds, of
which 425, or nearly two-thirds, are bond funds. The average yearly fee of
these bond funds, per Morningstar, is a relatively chunky 1.16 percent.
Establishing a position in 
exchange-traded funds
Although relatively new, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have caught on big in
the past several years. If you read my Exchange-Traded Funds For Dummies,
you’ll know that I’m a big fan. ETFs, like closed-end funds, trade on the
exchanges like individual stocks. (Yes, even the bond ETFs trade that way.)
You pay a small brokerage fee when you buy, and another when you sell. But
while you own the fund, your yearly fees are very low; they are, in fact, a frac-
tion of what you’d pay for a typical bond mutual fund or closed-end fund.
241
Chapter 16: Picking a Bond Fund That Will Serve You for Life

Unlike closed-end funds, ETFs maintain a price that very closely matches the
net asset value, or the value of all the securities in the portfolio. Unlike both
closed-end funds and mutual funds, all bond ETFs are index funds . . . at least
at present. As this book was going to print, there were discussions about the
launch of the first actively-managed bond ETF. (Oddly enough, the company
that may launch it is Vanguard, which is famous for its indexing philosophy.)
There aren’t all that many fixed-income ETFs relative to mutual and closed-
end funds — only 40 at present. But my prediction is that within a short time
after this book is published, that number will double or perhaps triple. Their
popularity is in part due to their low expense ratio. The average bond ETF
charges only 0.15 percent a year in operating expenses.
Understanding unit investment trusts
A unit investment trust (UIT) is a bundle of securities handpicked by a man-
ager. You buy into the UIT as you would an actively managed mutual fund.
But unlike the manager of the mutual fund, the UIT manager does not actively
trade the portfolio. Rather, he or she buys the bonds (or in some cases, bond
funds), perhaps 10 or 20 of them, and holds them throughout the life of the
bonds or for the life of the UIT. A UIT, which may contain a mix of corporate
bonds, Treasuries, and munis, has a maturity date — it could be a year, 5
years, or even 30 years down the road. Interest payments (or principal pay-
ments, should a bond mature or be called) from a UIT may arrive monthly,
quarterly, or semi-annually. There are usually very modest management
expenses (0.20 to 0.30 percent) for a UIT, but you pay a commission to buy it
(never to sell), usually of 1 to 3 percent. Contact any major brokerage house
if you’re interested.
Should you be interested?
“A UIT can give you the diversification of a mutual fund as well as greater
transparency by knowing exactly what bonds are in your portfolio,” says
Chris Genovese, senior vice president of Fixed Income Securities, a nation-
wide firm that provides targeted advice on bond portfolio construction to
investment advisors. “They are certainly appropriate for many individual
investors, whether in retirement accounts or investment accounts.” UITs
come and go from the marketplace, explains Genovese. “If you are interested
in seeing the currently available selection, talk to your broker. Look at the
prospectus. As you would with any other bond investment, weigh the bene-
fits and the risks of the bonds in the portfolio, and determine if it looks like
the right mix for you.”
242
Part IV: Bonds Away! Navigating the Fixed-Income Marketplace 

Knowing What Matters Most in Choosing
a Bond Fund of Any Sort
For years, alchemists tried to turn common metals into gold. It can’t be done.
The first rule to follow when choosing a bond fund is to find one appropriate
to your particular portfolio needs, which means finding a bond fund made of
the right material. After all, bond fund managers can’t do all that much more
than alchemists.
Selecting your fund based on its
components and their characteristics
It you’re looking for a bond fund that’s going to produce steady returns with
little volatility and very limited risk to your principal, start with a bond fund
that is built of low-volatility bonds issued by credit-worthy institutions. A
perfect example would be a short-term Treasury bond fund. If you’re looking
for kick-ass returns in a fixed-income fund, you can start looking for funds
built of high-yield fixed-income securities.
One of the main characteristics you look for in a bond is its tax status. Most
bonds are taxable, but municipal bonds are federally tax-free. If you want to
laugh off taxes, choose a municipal bond fund. But just as with the individual
muni bonds themselves, expect lower yield with a muni fund. Also pick and
choose your muni fund based on the level of taxation you’re looking to avoid.
State-specific municipal bond funds filled with triple-tax-free bonds (free from
federal, state, and local tax) will be triple-tax-free themselves.
Pruning out the underperformers
Obviously, you want to look at any prospective bond fund’s performance vis
a vis its peers. If you are examining index funds, the driving force behind
returns will be the fund’s operating expenses. Intermediate-term Treasury
bond index fund X will generally do better than intermediate-term Treasury
bond index fund Y if less of the profits are eaten up by operating expenses.
With actively managed funds . . . guess what? Operating expenses are also a
driving force. One study conducted by Morningstar, reported in The Wall
Street Journal, looked at high quality, taxable bond funds available to all
investors with minimums of less than $10,000. More than half of those funds
charge investors 1 percent or more. Not surprisingly, almost three-quarters of
those pricier funds showed performance that was in the bottom half of the
category for 2006.
243
Chapter 16: Picking a Bond Fund That Will Serve You for Life

Russell’s rule: Don’t pay more than 1 percent a year for any bond fund unless
you have a great reason. And don’t invest in any actively managed bond fund
that hasn’t outperformed its peers — and any proper and appropriate bench-
marks — for at least several years. (By “proper and appropriate bench-
marks,” I am referring to bond indexes that most closely match the
composition of the bond fund in question. A high-yield bond fund, given that
you can expect more volatility, should produce higher yields than, say, a
Treasury index. Any comparison of a high-yield fund’s return to a Treasury
index is practically moot.)
Laying down the law on loads
An astonishing number of bond funds charge loads. A load is nothing more
than a sales commission, sometimes paid when buying the fund (that’s called
a front-end load) and sometimes paid when selling (that’s called a back-end or
deferred load). My advice? NEVER PAY A LOAD. There is absolutely no reason
you should ever pay a load of (not unheard of) 5.5 percent to buy a bond
fund. The math simply doesn’t work in your favor.
If you pay a 5.5 percent load to buy into a fund with $10,000, you lose $550 up
front. You start with an investment of only $9,450. Suppose that the fund man-
ager is a veritable wizard and gets a 7 percent return over the next five years,
whereas similar bond funds with similar yearly operating expenses are
paying only 6 percent. Here’s what you’ll have in five years with the load
fund: $13,254. Here’s what you’d have with the no-load fund: $13,382.
Russell’s rule: Buying a load bond fund is plain and simple dumb. Don’t.
Repeat: Don’t buy load funds.
Sniffing out false promises
Although morally dubious, and in some cases even illegal, some brokerage
houses and financial supermarket Web sites have been known to promote
certain bond funds over others not because those funds are any better but
because a certain fund company paid to be promoted. Buyer beware!
“If you see a certain bond fund or funds being promoted as premium choices
on your broker’s Web site, you might want to ask the broker outright if the
firm is being compensated for that promotion,” advises John Gannon, senior
vice president, investor education, with the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority (FINRA).

My Picks for Some of the 
Best Bond Funds
And now for the meat . . . In this section I introduce you to bond funds well
worth considering for your portfolio. I lay them out in roughly the same order
I introduce you to various kinds of bonds in Part II of this book. I start with
very short-term, investment-grade bond funds, sometimes referred to as near
cash. I then proceed to longer-term Treasuries, corporate bonds (investment-
grade and junk), agency bonds, municipal bonds, and international bonds.
If you have a somewhat modest portfolio (less than $50,000), I wrap up this
chapter with some recommendations for good blend funds that allow you
instant exposure to a variety of bonds. If you have an even more modest port-
folio (less than $20,000), I suggest you consider a fund that allows you instant
exposure to a variety of both bonds and stocks, and I name a great one.
245
Chapter 16: Picking a Bond Fund That Will Serve You for Life
Evaluating bond fund advertisements
Some years ago, back in the “wild west” days,
bond fund advertisements were often squirrelly
tracts of trash. “We don’t see as many bad ads
as we used to see,” says Paul Herbert, senior
mutual fund analyst with Morningstar. “The
regulators have cracked down to a good degree.”
Although we’ve come a long way, readers are
still advised to read bond mutual fund adver-
tisements with a critical eye. Herbert’s first
piece of advice: “Pay the most attention to
everything in small print, and the least attention
to everything in large print!”
What he means is that the large print in the ads
usually ballyhoos a fund’s short-term perform-
ance and short-term ranking by the likes of
Morningstar and Lipper. There’s nothing wrong
with casting a quick eye at recent returns. “But
you should be looking more closely at long-
term performance and ranking,” says Herbert.
Anything shy of three to five years’perform-
ance, and you have little indication of whether
the bond fund manager really has any skill.
A bond fund’s performance, which is largely
measured by its past yield, can go up or down
moving forward. Bond funds are not bonds, 
and they aren’t CDs. Price of the shares and
yields will change over time. The riskier bond
classes — long-term bonds and high-yield
bonds — are especially prone to change.
Of course, you would know that if you read 
the very small print at the bottom of each 
advertisement:
Performance data represents past performance, which
does not guarantee future results.

Please note that under each section, I list my favorite funds alphabetically. If
you were to see a bond fund called Aardvark Bonds (you won’t, but humor
me) followed by a bond fund called Zygote Fixed Income, don’t assume that 
I like Aardvark any more than I do Zygote.
Very short-term, high quality bond funds
These funds are going to pay slightly higher rates of interest than money
market funds and CDs but less than longer-term bond funds. They carry very
little risk of default and have minimal volatility. Sometimes referred to as
near-cash, these bond funds are often the best investments for money that
you may need to tap within one to three years.

spared, perhaps entirely, from paying federal income tax. For more on munici-
pal tax-free bonds, see Chapter 8. Note that I’ve chosen two “high-yield” muni
funds as my favorites. “High-yield” does not mean the same in the world of

The worst of the worst? They have loads (com-

Morgan Stanley High-Yield Securities A

Ack! With a 4.25 percent front-end load and 1.30
percent in annual expenses, you wouldn’t
expect this fund to shine, but still, a ten-year

hard to explain, never mind swallow. My con-
dolences to those who invested in past years.
BlackRock High Income (HIS)
Ohmygod! The yearly expense ratio of 1.34 
is high, but it still doesn’t explain why this
closed-end fund, for all the risk it takes with its
allegedly “high-yield” bonds, has a ten-year
annual return of only 2.24 percent.
Permanent Port Treasury (PRTBX)
Shoot me! A 1.42 percent yearly expense ratio
on a Treasury bond fund is incredibly steep. The
15-year annual return of only 3.02 (just keeping

take. Pity the investors.

lthough I do use the word retirement in this section, 
I really prefer to use retunement. Today’s retirement
has changed so much from a generation ago that the 
difference is almost as great as between stationary and 
stationery, cats and cuts, flies and fries.
A generation ago, most people built a small nest egg,
retired at 65, got a pension and Social Security, and lived
predictably ever after. Today, the pension has vanished
for many. Social Security isn’t as secure as it was. Savings
rates are negligible.
All this has served to blur the line of retirement. Some
older Americans can’t retire. Some much younger ones
can. Some folks are working part-time and using savings
for supplemental income (whether they should or not).
This section is for anyone who has begun to take with-
drawals from a portfolio or is thinking about doing so. It’s
about tapping into that portfolio in the most rational
manner. It’s about using the portfolio to live the life of
your dreams, while keeping your nest egg intact just in
case you live to 105.
You won’t be surprised to find that bonds are an essential
part of the picture.

W
hen I was young, my father would suit up every morning, get into the
car, hit the Long Island Expressway, and battle his way into Brooklyn,
among the grittier of New York City’s boroughs. There, at 50 Court Street, he
would take the elevator to his seventh-story office, make himself a cup of
coffee, and turn on a big fan that would spit out U.S. dollars, which my father
would collect and stuff into his brown leather briefcase.
For years, that’s how I thought my family paid the bills.
I realized at some point that my father’s story of how he made money wasn’t
entirely true. (Nor was he a five-star general in World War II, even though my
Uncle Sid, also a five-star general, corroborated the story entirely.)
Today, many youngsters believe that money is produced by ATM machines.
(That’s probably because with air conditioning, they don’t see many electric
fans anymore.) But, of course, we mature, educated adults don’t harbor such
silly fantasies about money. Doooweee?
Yeah, right.
There’s a particular fantasy about money and retirement, and it goes some-
thing like this: You work hard for many years, you send holiday cards to the
creep of a boss, you invest in stocks all the while, and the stocks grow. Then,
when your portfolio has grown enough, you move your money to safe bonds,
you no longer have to send holiday cards to the creep of a boss, you retire, you
live off the interest from the bonds, and you golf.

In this chapter, I explain why that line of reasoning may be as silly as thinking
money comes from fans — maybe more so. I explain why a diversified portfo-
lio that includes bonds and healthy doses of other investments makes just as
much sense to a retiree as it does to working folk. And I explain — in this
chapter and the next — how to use your bonds, in conjunction with other
investments, to ride steadily and easily into your financial future long after
you’ve given up the day job in Brooklyn (or wherever you happen to cur-
rently toil).
Reaping the Rewards 
of Your Investments
At this very moment, as I’m typing this very paragraph, I’m feeling rather for-
tunate. I’ve had a number of jobs in my life that I didn’t particularly enjoy
(credit analyst, Maryland National Bank, Baltimore, 1981). But I’ve also had
some that I’ve enjoyed enormously (yoga instructor, Club Med, Al Hoceima,
Morocco, 1978). Luckily, my current job (financial planner and author,
Allentown, Pennsylvania) falls into the latter category.
As much as I enjoy my present work, it comforts me greatly to know that in a
few more years — fewer if this book sells a lot of copies! — whether I get up
in the morning to do work-for-pay, or whether I decide to volunteer my time
for a worthy cause, to sleep in, or to phone a friend for a chat, will be com-
pletely up to me.
What makes work-for-pay optional (other than being born rich, resorting to
crime, or marrying a heart surgeon) is a freedom portfolio — a portfolio big
enough to produce the income needed to support your lifestyle.
When is a portfolio big enough that employment becomes optional? When it
provides enough cash flow to pay the bills: both today’s and tomorrow’s. The
tough part about retirement planning is that you don’t know how many
tomorrows there are going to be; it’s hard to estimate bills that are years off;
and certain ongoing expenses, such as medical bills, may be well beyond
your control. In addition, Congress keeps toying with “sunset” provisions and
such, so you can’t even estimate your future tax bills.
And on top of all that, even though a predictable cash flow for you could be
arranged, total predictability comes at a heavy price.
262
Part V: Bonds As Replacements for the Old Paycheck 

Estimating your target portfolio
In Chapter 12, I introduce the 20 times rule: You figure out how much money
you need to live on for a year (being realistic — look at your bills) and multi-
ply that number by 20. That is the very minimum most financial profession-
als, including me, would want to see you have in your portfolio before you
permanently quit your day job. Anything less, and you can’t have any reason-
able assurance that you aren’t going to be living off baked beans and home-
grown parsley someday. But this rough rule doesn’t factor in the price of
beans, how many beans you can eat, or any number of other variables over
the coming decades.
To do a much better estimation and get a firmer idea of what kind of portfolio
you should shoot for, you may want to hire a financial planner with fancy
software to create a retirement plan for you. Or you can turn to any number
of Web sites, some of which do a fairly okay (but not great) job at estimating
the size portfolio you’ll need. Among my favorites is a Web site called
www.firecalc.com. (Click on the Advanced FIREcalc tab, and take it from
there.) Just about all brokerage house and financial supermarket Web sites
have calculators, as well.
Although they’re better than any rough rule (even mine), the problem with all
retirement plans — yes, even the fancy ones done by professionals — is that
they are static. Over the course of your life, things will change: interest rates,
the inflation rate, your portfolio returns, your spending, your health, and
those stupid sunset provisions on certain taxes, to name a few. All of which is
to say that for the moment, we’re going to accept the 20x rule, as splintery
rough as it is, and move on to the question of where your cash is actually
going to come from after you are no longer getting a paycheck.
Cash flow, dear reader, is the name of the game. Cash is what you need to quit
your paid employment, if that is your goal.
After all, you may have $5 million in net worth, but if that $5 million is in the
form of a framed Picasso hanging in the hallway or a house atop a hill with an
Olympic-sized swimming pool in the backyard, you may be technically a
multimillionaire but possibly not have enough in your wallet to buy lunch for
one at Taco Bell.
Lining up your bucks
The gods of retirement offer you a number of options for putting cash in your
wallet. If you are one of those lucky Americans (retired congressmen, sena-
tors, presidents) who can still bank on a solid fixed pension with health bene-
fits, that’s great. Social Security, when you’re gray enough, can also provide
steady cash.
263
Chapter 17: Fulfilling the Need for Steady, Ready, Heady Cash

But because this is an investment book, I spend the rest of this chapter, and
the next, talking about the money you can tap from your savings. It’s money
that most of us who are not retired senators will need in order to retire, and it
can come from one of three sources: interest, dividends, and the sale of secu-
rities. Which of these three options (or what combination of the three) you
choose will have a great bearing on how big your portfolio needs to be and
how much you can safely withdraw so as to never have to resort to eating
dog food.
The best option — always — is to adopt a cash withdrawal plan from your
portfolio that is flexible and potentially allows for all three sources of cash
flow to play into your new paycheckless life. One of the biggest and most
common investment mistakes that people make is to lock their sights on one
form of cash flow (typically interest income) and ignore the others.
Toward the end of this chapter, I show you how a flexible, sensible, triple-
source-of-cash-flow plan works. First, allow me to introduce you to each of
the three options just mentioned and explain why the gods of retirement cre-
ated them, where to find them, and how to maximize them.
Finding Interesting Sources of Interest
All pigs are mammals, but not all mammals are pigs. Bonds are fixed-income
investments, but not all fixed-income investments are bonds. Anything that
yields steady, predictable interest can qualify as fixed income. That includes
not only bonds, but CDs, money market accounts, and a few other not-as-
common investments that I address here. Any and all of these may serve as
sources of cash, either to boost a pre-retirement portfolio or help mine cash
from a post-retirement portfolio.
Certificates of deposit (CDs)
As predictable as the Arizona sunrise, CDs, like zero-coupon bonds, offer
your principal back with interest after a specified time frame (usually in
increments of three months) up to five years in the future. Like savings-bank
accounts, CDs are almost all guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (FDIC), a government-sponsored agency, for amounts up to
$100,000. Interest rates offered tend to increase with the amount of time
you’re willing to tie your money up. (If the bank will give you, say, 5 percent
interest for six months, you can often get 5.20 percent for 12 months.) Take
your money out before the maturity of the CD, and you pay a fine, the sever-
ity of which depends on the particular issuer.
264
Part V: Bonds As Replacements for the Old Paycheck 

Because nearly all CDs are federally insured, they are on par with Treasury
bonds as far as your principal being secure. Interest rates vary and may be
higher or lower than you can get on a Treasury bond of the same maturity.
(Check www.bankrate.com and your newspaper for the highest CD rates
available.) FDIC-insured Internet banking accounts, which tend to pay higher
rates of interest than the corner bank, are also often on a par with one-year to
two-year CDs. Often the three investments — CDs, short-term Treasuries, and
Internet banking accounts — hug very closely to the same (modest) interest
rate. If all three are equal, the CD, a favorite with retirees everywhere, should
be your last choice. Here are two key reasons:
 The CD requires you to tie your money up; the FDIC-insured Internet
bank account does not.
 The CD, as well as the bank account, generates fully taxable income; the
Treasury bond or bond fund income is federally taxable but exempt
from state tax.
Even though there can be blips in time when CDs are great deals, by and large,
CDs are vastly oversold. If you’re going to settle for a modest interest rate,
there’s generally no reason you need to have your money be held captive.
Compared to bonds: Most bonds provide higher long-term returns than CDs.
Only Treasury bonds carry the iron-clad principal guarantee of a CD, however.
Mining the many money market funds
Money market funds are mutual funds that invest in very short-term debt
instruments (such as Treasury bills, CDs, and bank notes) and provide a
stable price with a very modest return. In essence, a money market is a bond
turned inside out. It provides a stable price with a floating interest rate, while
a bond provides stable return with a potentially volatile market price (if you
sell the bond before maturity). Money market funds are not guaranteed by
the federal government, as are most CDs and savings bank accounts, but they
are very safe due to the quality of their investments, short-term maturities,
and the good name of the issuer. (If a Fidelity, Vanguard, or Schwab money
market failed to pay investors, there’d likely be a mass exit out of the broker-
age house that same day.)
At rare times in history, when long-term lending pays no more than short-
term lending (a flat yield curve, as I discuss in Part I), money market funds
can offer a yield competitive with, perhaps even exceeding, short-term bond
funds. (Short-term means that the bonds held by the fund generally mature in
one to three years.) At most times in history, however, a money market fund
will not pay as much as bond funds. Some money market funds, however,
may offer yields as high as you can get on any CD.
265
Chapter 17: Fulfilling the Need for Steady, Ready, Heady Cash

Money market funds are often used as the cash or sweep positions at most
brokerage houses. Be aware that when you open an account at a brokerage
house, the default, if you fail to specify which sweep account you want, may
be a very low-yielding money market fund. And simply for the asking, you can
have your money moved to a higher yielding money market fund. But you
need to ask: “Which is your highest paying sweep account?”
Compared to bonds: Expect most bonds to provide higher long-term returns
than money market funds. Money market funds, however, offer greater liquid-
ity and a very high degree of safety.
Banking on online savings accounts
On the day I’m typing this paragraph, www.bankrate.com, a terrific source
of financial information, is listing over a dozen online banks, all FDIC-insured,
that are offering interest rates on savings accounts higher than any CD rate
available. Some of them are advertising introductory offers of several
months’ interest no less than a half percentage point above anything I found
on a CD. Some, such as ING Direct, are offering a $25 check to anyone opening
a new account with at least $250. So why tie up your money in a CD when you
don’t have to?
Compared to bonds: Expect most bonds to provide higher long-term returns
than any savings account. An online savings account, however, may offer
fairly handsome rates, with instant liquidity and FDIC insurance.
Prospering in peer-to-peer lending
This is the new kid on the fixed-income block. If you haven’t checked out
www.prosper.com yet, do so now. Even if you decide not to invest, you’ll
likely find the cybertrip fascinating. Prosper is something like an eBay for
cash. (It has some similarities to Match.com, too.) People go onto the Web
site and explain why they need money (often posting pictures of themselves
looking as respectable and likeable as possible), and other people choose
whether to lend them money or not. Prosper calls it peer-to-peer lending.
Instead of turning to a credit card company, would-be borrowers can go
public with their need for money and perhaps get a better deal. In fact, they
often do. And lenders, although charging less interest than Visa and
MasterCard (not hard to do), can still get a higher return than they would in
another fixed-income investment, like bonds.
266
Part V: Bonds As Replacements for the Old Paycheck 

I became a Prosper lender a year ago, and I’ve gotten about 10 percent on my
money. Not bad. But I’ve also been lucky. I’ve spread my $2,000 investment
over 20 loans, and I have yet to experience a default. I know other lenders
(through the Prosper forum) who haven’t been nearly as fortunate. In fact,
some have gotten badly stung. Prosper says it does credit checks on all bor-
rowers, but credit checks aren’t perfect. And some of the borrowers are
listed as known bad credit risks. You can choose them or avoid them.
All in all, I find this a promising venture, although certainly nothing to bank
too much on. Investment-wise, I look at it as the equivalent of corporate junk
bonds, but the return may be higher than you can get lending to corpora-
tions. Only time will tell.
A few caveats if you want to give Prosper a try:
 Spread your loans out. Don’t lend too much to any one person, regard-
less of how good his or her story is. Check out the credit ratings of each
individual provided by Prosper. Make sure that all your loans aren’t
going to deadbeats.
 Take Prosper’s return figures with a big, fat grain of salt. The statements
will tell you that you’re earning, say, 14 percent on your money, but they
don’t factor in the time your cash sits idle. It may take weeks before
your loans go through, and Prosper doesn’t pay you anything while your
money is parked.
 Know that you are taking substantial risk with your money. I’ve lately
seen advertisements for Prosper on the Internet, one of which is aimed
at potential lenders; it reads “It’s Simple, Safe & Secure.” BS! It isn’t all
that simple — it will take you some time to get up to speed — and it isn’t
at all safe and secure. If you want safe and secure, put your money in an
FDIC-insured savings account!
 Know, too, that your Prosper money will likely be tied up for at least
three years, the term of repayment on all the loans.
Prosper has a competitor, a British company called www.zopa.com, which is
reportedly making an effort to enter the U.S. market. Officials from both
Prosper and Zopa have promised to look into ways to create a secondary
market for their loans. If they succeed, the loans may still be risky, but at
least your cash wouldn’t be tied up for three years.
Compared to bonds: Expect peer-to-peer lending to generate a yield compara-
ble to high-yield corporate bonds, perhaps higher. The risk also may be com-
parable (which is to say considerable) and perhaps significantly higher —
especially if you choose to lend to high-risk borrowers in search of higher
returns. Interest earned will be taxed as normal income.

Chapter 17: Fulfilling the Need for Steady, Ready, Heady Cash

Considering the predictability 
of an annuity
A cross between an insurance product and an investment, annuities come in
myriad shapes and sizes. The general theme is that you give your money to
an institution (an insurance company, a brokerage house, or even a charity),
and that institution promises you a certain rate of return, typically for as long
as you live. The difference between an annuity and a bond: With an annuity,
you don’t expect to ever see your principal back. In return for giving up your
principal, you expect a higher rate of return.
Some annuities, called variable annuities, offer rates of return pegged to
something like the stock market. Other annuities, called fixed annuities, offer
a steady rate of return or perhaps a rate of return that adjusts for inflation.
Some annuities charge a small fortune in fees. Most annuities ask for surren-
der charges if you try to change your mind.
Be careful out there! A majority of annuities are horrific rip-offs, with all kinds
of hidden costs and high surrender charges should you attempt to escape 
(as many people do when they finally figure out the costs). I’m talking about a
very steep penalty here. A typical annuity may charge you, say, 7 percent of
the total amount invested if you withdraw your money within a year, 6 per-
cent within two years, and so on, with a gradual tapering off up to seven
years.
Most annuities are sold with 78-page contracts that no one, not even lawyers,
can understand.
There are good annuity products, too. See Annuities For Dummies by Kerry
Pechter (Wiley, 2008). I have a strong preference for fixed annuities that
adjust with inflation. One of the best providers of those is Vanguard. You can
get an instant quote online at www.vanguard.com. Do a search for “fixed
annuity.” Such a product makes more sense for older folks, especially those
with no interest in leaving anything to heirs.
Never put an annuity into a tax-advantaged retirement account, such as an
IRA. A main advantage to an annuity is the ability to defer taxes. Putting an
annuity into an IRA, which is already tax-advantaged, makes about as much
sense as donating money to Donald Trump.
Compared to bonds: The return you get on an annuity will be based on your
age. The older you get, the higher the return. In almost all cases, you’ll get
more cash flow than you would investing in bonds, but you give up your prin-
cipal. The taxing of annuity income can be very complicated. Talk to your tax
advisor.

Part V: Bonds As Replacements for the Old Paycheck 

Hocking your home with 
a reverse mortgage
These babies have been around for years but have exploded in popularity in
the past several years. You own a home? You’re 62 or over? You can sell it
back to the bank over time. Each month, you get a check. Each month, you
have less equity in your home. Reverse mortgages are complicated. And, like
annuities, there are both good and bad. Do your research. Here are some 
suggestions:
 Order the booklet “Home Made Money” from AARP at 1-800-209-8085.
 Talk to a reverse-mortgage counselor. AARP has some on board, or try
the nonprofit Consumer Credit Counseling Service in your area. Perhaps
your best option is to call the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development at 1-800-569-4287 to be referred to a HUD-certified reverse
mortgage counselor in your area.
 Oh, and read Reverse Mortgages For Dummies by Sarah Glendon Lyons
and John E. Lucas (Wiley).
Compared to bonds: The cash flow you get from a reverse mortgage will 
vary tremendously depending on your age, the equity you have in your
home, and the terms of the mortgage agreement. Reverse-mortgage income is
not taxable.
Recognizing that Stocks Can Be 
Cash Cows, Too (Moo)
Stocks can generate returns in two ways:
 They can appreciate in value.
 They can issue dividends.
Historically, dividends have actually accounted for the lion’s share of stock
returns. In the past couple decades, however, it’s been the other way around.
Stock returns of late have been pretty darned good, but the dividend yield 
of an average basket of U.S. stocks, per Morningstar, is now only about 0.76
percent. The average dividend yield of the S&P 500 (500 of America’s fattest
corporations) currently stands at a lackluster 1.6 percent.
269
Chapter 17: Fulfilling the Need for Steady, Ready, Heady Cash

Stock dividends, by definition, are not fixed in stone, as are interest payments
on bonds. However, they can, within a diversified portfolio of stocks, deliver
a fairly consistent cash flow. And unlike bond interest, which is generally
taxed as income, the vast majority of stock dividends receive special tax
treatment and would rarely be taxed at anything higher than 15 percent 
(at least under current laws).
Not all stocks are equally likely to cough up dividends. If you wish, you can
add stocks to your portfolio that will do just that. You can grab your divi-
dends with either individual stocks or with any number of mutual funds or
exchange-traded funds that offer high-dividend paying stocks.
Focusing on stocks with sock-o dividends
By choosing your stocks selectively, or by picking up a high-dividend stock
mutual fund or exchange-traded fund, you can fairly handily up your yearly
dividend yield to about 3 percent. A lot of investors have been doing just that
of late, for the very same reason that investors usually jump on board any
investing style: Dividend stocks have kicked ass of late.
But high-dividend stocks don’t kick ass every year, or every decade. High-
dividend paying companies, often categorized as value companies (catego-
rized as such precisely because they pay out higher dividends), tend to
invest less in their own growth. Companies that are more miserly with divi-
dends (often called growth companies) tend to shovel more into R&D and
such. Sometimes that R&D and such translates into greater profits that result
in gangbuster stock performance. (Think of the entire 1990s; growth stocks
were definitely the place to be.)
There’s certainly nothing wrong with dividends, per se, but by focusing on
them you may be giving up on absolute return. The best stock portfolios are
well diversified: They have both value and growth stocks. I wouldn’t want to
see you with a stock portfolio of all high-dividend companies, even though
the cash flow would be sweet.
Nor would I want to see you with a portfolio too concentrated in a handful of
industry sectors. As fate would have it, most high-dividend paying stocks
tend to fall heavily in certain industry sectors, such as utilities, tobacco,
pharmaceuticals, and banks. Gear your portfolio too heavily toward high divi-
dends, and you’ll be pretty much locking yourself outside of semiconductors,
medical equipment, Internet technology, biotechnology, and other sectors
that may well turn out to be the superstars of the next decade.
270
Part V: Bonds As Replacements for the Old Paycheck 

Compared to bonds: The cash flow from interest on bonds will be greater
and more predictable than the cash flow from stock dividends. Over the long
haul, however, expect the total return on stocks (which includes both divi-
dends and price appreciation) to be higher. Stocks are also much more
volatile than bonds. Whereas bond interest is typically issued semiannually
and bond funds usually pay interest monthly, stock dividends are more com-
monly posted quarterly, although stock funds may issue dividends quarterly,
semiannually, or annually.
Realizing gain with real estate 
investment trusts (REITs)
One particular sector of the stock market, real estate investment trusts
(REITs), offers among the highest dividend yields in the land: currently 3.1
percent, says Morningstar. REITs are also slightly different animals from most
stocks, in that REITs must, per the law, pay out at least 90 percent of their
earnings as dividends. And the dividends that REITs pay are generally not
taxed at 15 percent, as are most other stock dividends, but rather at normal
income tax rates.
The real estate sector also shows delightfully low correlation to the rest of
the stock market. So whether or not you want the dividends, it may not be a
bad idea to plunk 10 to 15 percent of the money you have allocated for stocks
into REITs — preferably low-cost, indexed REIT mutual funds or exchange-
traded funds, both U.S. and foreign.
Caveat: REIT distributions are not only generally taxed as regular income, but
they may include return of principal, which can make tax reporting tricky. For
this reason, it is best to house your REIT holdings in a tax-advantaged retire-
ment account.
Compared to bonds: Even though REITs pay very high dividends by stock
standards, what you get in cash flow probably won’t be as much as you could
get on interest from bonds of equal principal value. REITs will be much more
volatile than bonds but also offer hugely greater potential for appreciation.
Taking a middle ground 
with preferred stock
Often referred to as a sort of hybrid between a stock and a bond, preferred
stock, issued by companies both public and private, generally offers greater
and more secure dividends than common stock. Preferred stock is also safer
than common stock in that if a company goes under, the holders of preferred
stock must be paid back before the owners of common stock.
271
Chapter 17: Fulfilling the Need for Steady, Ready, Heady Cash

There are many variations of preferred stock with varying degrees of payoff
and risk. Generally, preferred stock, like most hybrid kinds of investments,
wouldn’t be my first choice of investment for most people. I’d prefer to see
you have a mix of stocks and bonds, which together will provide the same
benefit as preferred stock, with more diversification power. If the concept of
preferred floats your boat, however, feel free to discuss it with your broker.
There are worse investments.
Compared to bonds. Preferred stocks’ dividends usually won’t be as much as
you’d get in bond interest on a similar amount of money. And preferred stock
is riskier. On the other hand, the dividends from the preferred stock will usu-
ally be more gingerly taxed than the interest on bonds. And some preferred
stock (convertible preferred) offers an opportunity for substantial capital
appreciation.
Introducing a Vastly Better Way to
Create Cash Flow: Portfolio Rebalancing
I’d like to start this section with two seemingly short and simple questions.
Are you ready?
Question #1: You have $100,000 in your portfolio. You withdraw exactly
$10,000. How much do you have left?
I know you know the answer.
Question #2: Does it matter whether the money you withdraw — the $10,000 —
comes from this past year’s interest payments on your bonds or this past
year’s appreciation in the value of your stock holdings?
Either way, you still have $90,000 left, riiiight?
Yes. Yes. YES. YESSSS.
And yet, despite the simplicity of these two questions, you’d be amazed at
how many people get the second question wrong. And then, when I look at
them quizzically, they argue with me.
“But . . . but . . . but . . . Russell . . . If I withdraw the money from bonds, since
that represents interest, my principal will still be intact. But if I withdraw the
money from stocks, I’m then tapping my principal, and then I’m eating into a
productive asset,” they argue.
272
Part V: Bonds As Replacements for the Old Paycheck 

No. That’s wrong. Your portfolio, after withdrawing the $10,000, will be worth
$90,000. Period. End of story. Argue all you want. This is basic math here. The
resulting balance is the same. It doesn’t matter whether the sum withdrawn
comes from bond interest, stock dividends, stock appreciation, selling the
Picasso from the hallway, renting out the pool, or unicorn droppings. It just
doesn’t matter.
I’m not sure where the bond-interest-is-okay-to-withdraw-but-stock-appreciation-
isn’t-okay-to-withdraw myth ever started. But for the record, there is no such
thing as leaving your bond principal intact. In truth, more than half the
money that you’re ever likely to earn in bonds is simply keeping your princi-
pal afloat of inflation. If you withdraw those inflation-neutralizing interest
payments from your portfolio, the remainder of your bond holdings won’t be
“intact” at all. Your bond holdings will slowly but surely lose value due to the
steadily rising cost of living, otherwise known as inflation.
Table 17-1 shows what $100 today will be worth in the future, assuming an
annual inflation rate of 3 percent (the current rate of inflation in the United
States). According to these figures, if you have a $100 bond maturing in 20
years and you siphon off all the coupon payments, your “intact” principal will
probably be worth only $55 when the bond matures. If you have $100 in stock
and you siphon off all the appreciation and dividends over the next 20 years,
the stock that remains will probably be worth $55, too.

When you can see that withdrawing $10,000 means withdrawing $10,000 —
regardless of the source — and that there’s no such thing as leaving your
principal “intact,” you are ready to create a portfolio that can handle with-
drawals objectively. By “objectively,” I am saying that sometimes it will make
sense to take your cash flow from appreciated stock, sometimes from stock
dividends, and sometimes from bond interest. As I say in the onset of this
chapter, the best option for withdrawing cash from a portfolio — always — is
to adopt a cash withdrawal plan that is flexible and potentially allows for all
three sources of cash flow.
273
Chapter 17: Fulfilling the Need for Steady, Ready, Heady Cash

Buying low and selling high
Here is the best method, far and away, for extracting cash from a portfolio.
For illustration purposes, I’m going to use a very simple portfolio, consisting
of Domestic Stock Fund A, Foreign Stock Fund F, Commodity Fund C, Bond
Fund B, and Short-Term Cash Fund S.
Your portfolio allocation today, based on careful analysis of your need for
return and your stomach for risk (as I discuss in Part III), looks like this:
Domestic Stock Fund A
26%
Foreign Stock Fund F
25%
Commodity Fund C
5%
Bond Fund B
38%
Short-Term Cash Fund S
6%
You’ve set up your accounts so that all of your interest, dividends, and capi-
tal gains are reinvested in (rolled directly into) each security as they accrue.
Six months pass. During that time, you’ve been pulling regularly from your
short-term cash fund (which, at 6 percent of your portfolio, is enough to
cover a year to 18 months’ expenses). The world economy is humming, and
stocks are sailing, especially foreign stocks. Your allocations have all gone
awry. Your portfolio now looks like this:
Domestic Stock Fund A
30%
Foreign Stock Fund F
32%
Commodity Fund C
5%
Bond Fund B
30%
Short-Term Cash Fund S
3%
What do you do? You rebalance. That means you sell off some of your stock
funds, and you use the proceeds both to boost your cash position and add to
your bond position. Your goal is to bring everything back into alignment so
you are once again starting with the same allocation (26 percent U.S. stocks,
25 percent foreign stocks, and so on) you had at the beginning of the year.
That allocation (your risk/return sweet spot) will only change if your life cir-
cumstances change — if, for example, you inherit $1 million from a rich uncle
or, conversely, a rich uncle successfully sues you for $1 million.
274
Part V: Bonds As Replacements for the Old Paycheck 

Rebalancing not only creates cash flow but also puts your portfolio on ana-
bolic steroids. Every six months (it doesn’t have to be six months, but I find
that is a good time frame for those making regular withdrawals), you are not
only providing yourself with living expenses and keeping your portfolio
where it should be in terms of your personal risk/return sweet spot, but you
are also continually selling high and buying low: the best formula I know —
the best formula there is — for long-term investment success.
One more example: Yet six months later. During this half-year, the stock
market took a face-dive, commodities soared, and bonds did very well. Your
portfolio at year-end again is out of alignment. It now looks like this:
Domestic Stock Fund A
22%
Foreign Stock Fund F
20%
Commodity Fund C
9%
Bond Fund B
46%
Short-Term Cash Fund S
3%
At this point, you’re going to sell off the bond and commodity portion of 
your portfolio. And, after you’ve gotten your cash position back up to where
you need it, you may wind up buying more stocks, which are now selling at
bargain-basement prices.
And what about all that bond interest?
In Part I of this book, I explain that bonds’ main role in your portfolio isn’t so
much for the income, nice as income is, but to provide ballast, to keep your
portfolio afloat when the waters get choppy. Now you can see why I’m of that
opinion.
The coupon payments from your bonds, or the interest payments generated
by your bond fund, are to be plowed directly back into the bond side of your
portfolio. This practice keeps your bond holdings from getting eaten up by
inflation. Historically, stocks have returned much more than bonds. If that
holds true in the future (if . . . if . . . if), you’ll be skimming much more from
the stock side of your portfolio during retirement. If the future turns out to be
different than the past, then those predictable bond coupons could spare you
from destitution, just as they may have spared your grandparents during the
Great Depression.
Bless bonds. Bless bond income. I only ask that you don’t become a slave to
that income.

Chapter 17: Fulfilling the Need for Steady, Ready, Heady Cash

Dealing with realities
In the real world, rebalancing can sometimes be a bit tricky. If your portfolio
is in a taxable account rather than a tax-advantaged retirement account, you
may have to contend with tax consequences when you sell any security. You
may also have to deal with trading costs, depending on your choice of securi-
ties and the brokerage house you use to house your portfolio. Trading costs
and taxes both can nibble away at a nest egg. You’ve got to be careful.
Perhaps you feel confident factoring those variables into your rebalancing
plan. If not, you should see a financial planner, at least for a single visit, to
help you orchestrate and fine-tune your rebalancing strategy.
But before you decide whether to handle it alone, read Chapter 18. In this
exciting chapter, I discuss your portfolio allocation during retirement and
how to sculpt your portfolio — including putting a certain good percentage in
bonds, of course — so as to maximize your withdrawal potential without
jeopardizing your nest egg.

W
hen it comes to old age, common fears include everything from incon-
tinence and impotence to failing eyesight and loose teeth. But on the
financial front, the greatest fear, it goes without saying, is running out of
money. For folks who have money in the first place, enough to build a decent
portfolio, two things generally can go awry: market volatility (a growly bear
suddenly turning investment dollars to dimes) and unexpectedly high infla-
tion (a slow and steady drain of spending power).
If you fear market volatility most, you may tend to err on the side of what is
traditionally seen as investment conservatism. You probably love predictable
investments, such as CDs, money markets, savings bonds, annuities, and
such. People who fear inflation more tend to err on the side of what is tradi-
tionally seen as investment aggressiveness. They go for maximum return.
They love stocks, commodities, real estate investments, and maybe high-
yield or leveraged bonds.
In this chapter, I present the views of both camps — financial liberals and
conservatives — blend them together, and present the view that I believe
makes the most sense. Together, you and I figure out the best mix of retire-
ment investments to weather both market volatility and inflation. As for
incontinence, impotence, and loose teeth . . . let’s leave all that for another
book, shall we?

Looking Ahead to Many Years of 
Possible Portfolio Withdrawals
Lifespans have increased. There’s better than a 50/50 chance that either you
or your spouse will still be alive at age 90. If you plan to retire at age 65, that
means you need a portfolio that can provide cash flow for about 25 more
years. Two and a half decades is a long time. It allows for inflation to eat up a
good bit of your savings. (Consider how much gasoline, a chocolate bar, or a
loaf of bread cost 25 years ago.)
If you or your spouse are 65 years old right now, Table 18-1 shows the odds
that you’ll still be alive and kicking at age 80, 90, or 100 (15, 25, or 35 years
beyond the traditional age of retirement). It’s based on 2005 figures from the
Society for Actuaries.

What that added longevity means, all things being equal, is that it behooves
you to invest a wee bit more aggressively than did your grandparents. How
aggressively? That depends on many factors, and it depends on who you ask.
There is, unfortunately, little consensus among financial professionals. Just
like the amateurs, we each have a certain bias.
Knowing Where the Real Danger Lies
Most financial pros have moved well beyond the old adage, held dearly for
years, that the percent of your portfolio held in bonds should be equal to
your age. (By age 60, you should be 60 percent in bonds; by age 70, 70 per-
cent; and so on.) Some say, as do I, that the formula is as antiquated as the
cross-bow — and potentially just as dangerous.
278
Part V: Bonds As Replacements for the Old Paycheck 

“The real risk to most people’s portfolios is, paradoxically, not taking enough
market risk with higher-returning but more volatile investments, like stocks
and commodities,” says Steve Cassaday, CFP, president of Cassaday &
Company, Inc., an investment management and financial planning firm in
McLean, Virginia. “Given what most people have saved by retirement, and the
average lifespan today, a more aggressive portfolio is the only choice if
people are going to maintain their lifestyles.”
Cassaday has researched the returns of various kinds of investments over the
past 35 years and has concluded that a portfolio of 15 percent bonds and 2.5
percent cash, with the rest in more aggressive but very well diversified
investments like stocks and commodities, actually offers the greatest degree
of absolute safety to the average investor. In other words, he opts to put his
retired clients in portfolios that are over 80 percent equities, including U.S.
stock, foreign stock, REITs, and commodities.
Cassaday’s views were published in the September 2006 issue of the Journal
of Financial Planning and have created quite a stir among professional finan-
cial types, many of whom are skeptical, at best, of Cassaday’s conclusions.
I know, as the author of a book on bonds, you wouldn’t expect me to agree
with Cassaday. However, I’ve seen his number-crunching, and I’m impressed.
Although I don’t buy into his strategy completely, I don’t think the guy is too
far off the mark. His aggressive portfolios, when back-tested (using computers
to simulate how they would have done over history), have held up remark-
ably well through both bull markets and bears. Sure, they dip when the stock
market is down, but they come back.
Finding your comfort zone
The aggressiveness of Cassaday’s approach may not be right for all investors.
I say that not because I doubt his numbers but for two other reasons:
 The future of the stock market may be not quite as rosy as the past.
 A portfolio of more than 80 percent equity is subject to huge dips in bad
times. People tend to panic and sell their fallen angels just when they
should be holding them the most. The stock and commodity markets are
like giant rubber bands: After the biggest down stretches, you tend to
see the strongest snap-backs, and vice versa (although giant rubber
bands tend to be more predictable than the stock market).
Keep in mind that a portfolio of 80 percent stocks and 20 percent bonds will
have short-term setbacks. According to data compiled by Vanguard, such a
portfolio has seen negative annual returns in 22 of the past 80 years. But the
average annual return was a very impressive 10 percent.
279
Chapter 18: Finding Comfort and Security in Old Age

For most people, a somewhat less aggressive portfolio than Cassaday’s
choice portfolio is probably going to work best. (Cassaday himself will amend
his portfolio for his clients that can’t emotionally handle a lot of volatility.)
Another financial-planning colleague of mine, William P. Bengen, CFP, wrote a
book for other financial planners called Conserving Client Portfolios During
Retirement (FPA Press), and in that book he suggests something of a compro-
mise between Cassaday’s portfolio and the traditional age-based portfolio.
Most financial planners I know are much, much more in line with Bengen’s
thinking than with Cassaday’s.
Setting your default at 60/40 
isn’t a bad idea
Bengen, like Cassaday, crunched the numbers backwards and forwards. His
conclusion: Yes, tweak your portfolio as you approach retirement to include
more bonds and less stock. But after you reach the 60 percent stock/40 percent
bond mark, stop right there. Think long and hard before reducing your stock
allocation or raising your bond allocation any more than you have already.
Given that stock returns have historically creamed bond returns, you may need
those stock returns if your portfolio is going to last as long as you do.
Of course, Bengen uses the 60/40 benchmark loosely. Think about your
“stocks” as any growth asset, which may also include commodities or invest-
ment real estate. Think of your “bonds” as any kind of fixed income, which
may also include annuities or CDs. If you err toward riskier growth assets,
such as small stocks, or riskier fixed-income investments, such as high-yield
bonds, you may tweak your 60/40 allocation to reflect that. In fact, there are
many reasons that you may tweak your percentage.
The take-home point: “Don’t be wooden,” says Bengen.
Choosing your ultimate ratio
Me? Unless my circumstances change, my personal retirement portfolio —
which I already have planned! — will be about 70/30: 70 percent stock and 
30 percent bonds. (Right now, at age 51, it’s just about 75/25.) But I feel that 
I can emotionally stomach more volatility than most people. I know that 
I won’t sell if the market takes a flop. And I have the kind of career that easily
allows me to work part-time to pick up a few bucks if the market sours badly
and I feel a need to supplement my portfolio income.
Obviously, retirement planning is a very personal process.
280
Part V: Bonds As Replacements for the Old Paycheck 

Not only that, but the United States Congress, in its own wisdom, has created
a plethora of “sunset” provisions, so that no one, not even the amazing
Carnac, not even the editors of Moolah magazine who pretend they know
which way the markets are going, can come very close to constructing a
retirement plan with any great precision. The sunset provisions are tempo-
rary changes in our tax codes that may or may not revert back to their origi-
nal standing. They affect everything from the estate tax to taxes on capital
gains and dividends.
Bottom (mushy) line: Most people living off their portfolios are advised to
have very well diversified portfolios (U.S. stock, foreign stock, small cap and
large cap stock, value and growth securities) with 25 percent to 45 percent
bonds (the majority of which should be investment-grade bonds). A very con-
servative investor may want 50 percent bonds. If you go beyond that, your
hankering for safety may very well backfire and your “safe” portfolio will
wind up risking your lifestyle as inflation takes its steady toll.
Calculating How Much 
You Can Safely Tap
Earlier in the book, I present the 20 times rule: a thumbprint that gives you a
very rough guide of how big a portfolio you need before you retire. In short,
figure out how much you need in a year, subtract whatever retirement
income you have outside of investment income (such as Social Security), 
and multiply the remainder by 20. So if you need $50,000 a year and Social
Security will provide $20,000, you should build a portfolio of ($30,000 x 20)
$600,000 before you kiss your office colleagues goodbye forever.
281
Chapter 18: Finding Comfort and Security in Old Age
What about the house?
If — and that’s a big if — you have sizeable
home equity and you think you’ll be able to
downsize to something cheaper at a certain
point in the future, you can factor your home
equity into your retirement portfolio. Most
people these days, however, seem to have a
hard time downsizing, in which case, your home
equity is nice to have but won’t provide you with
any needed cash. Not now. Not later. If you
want to give up your day job, the two empty
rooms upstairs won’t help you have cash to pay
for groceries. Of course, if you’re willing to sell
the ranch and move into an apartment or retire-
ment facility, the home equity you’ve built up
can play a very important role in your sunset
years.

That rough rule, like all rough rules, is the product of a few assumptions.
Foremost, it assumes that you have a diversified portfolio returning enough
so you can not only keep up with inflation but withdraw 4 to 5 percent a year
without denting your principal.
That allowable withdrawal amount will depend on a whole slew of factors,
such as the actual rate of inflation, your tax hit, market conditions, and — a
biggie — your life expectancy and your current age. (At age 97, it is probably
okay to see a slow dwindling in your portfolio size.) A lot of those variables,
such as your lifespan, you can control only to a limited extent (eat carrots).
What you can control entirely — and what will have great bearing on how
much you can withdraw — is the allocation of your portfolio, especially the
ratio of stocks to bonds.
Revisiting risk, return, and 
realistic expectations
How realistic is a 4 to 5 percent withdrawal rate in the real world? According
to figures from Vanguard, a retirement portfolio with an allocation of 50 per-
cent bonds and 50 percent stocks has about a 75 percent chance of lasting 
30 years, provided the initial withdrawal is limited to 4 percent and then
adjusted for inflation. I don’t know about you, but I find that number a bit
depressing. It means that you will need $1 million to generate $40,000 a year,
and even then, you could go broke before you die.
With a portfolio that is 60 percent stocks and 40 percent bonds, and provided
you regularly rebalance your portfolio (as I describe in Chapter 17), that
same 4 to 5 percent withdrawal rate gives you about a 95 percent chance of
getting through 30 years of retirement — unless the markets take an unprece-
dented dive. That figure is much less depressing than the previous one!
According to Steve Cassaday, if you are willing to deal with the volatility that
comes with a portfolio of 80 percent equities, you should be able to withdraw
up to 7 percent a year and be safe for 30 years and beyond. However, there
will likely be times that your portfolio sinks, and sinks hard, and you’ll be
wondering whether you’re going to run out of money next month. I like
Cassady’s figure best of all (who wouldn’t?). But again, I’m not sure how
many people could sit tight and deal with the kind of volatility that would be
inevitable with such a market-risk laden portfolio.

Part V: Bonds As Replacements for the Old Paycheck 

Basing your retirement on clear thinking
History rarely repeats although, I’m not the first to say, it often echoes. The
long-term return on large stocks — at least over the past century or so — has
been about 10 percent a year. Small stocks (prone to greater price sways)
have returned about 12.5 percent a year. The long-term return on bonds has
been about 5 percent. And the inflation rate moving forward, most econo-
mists agree, will probably stay somewhere close to its present 3 percent.
Based on these numbers, and based on the final portfolio allocation you
decide, you can best judge whether your portfolio can long sustain a 3 per-
cent withdrawal, a 7 percent withdrawal, or something in between.
My 70 percent equity/30 percent bond retirement portfolio, after I have it 
in place and start withdrawing from it, should safely allow me to withdraw 
5 percent a year for at least 30 years. And, when I die, there should still be
something left for my kids.
But that’s me. You need to devise your own plan based on your own
longevity, stomach for risk, and the other factors I describe earlier in this
chapter. I would only ask you not to think pie-in-the-sky and, as William
Bengen says, “Don’t be wooden.” Allow yourself some flexibility to adjust
your cash flow after you begin to withdraw. No retirement plan should be
fixed in stone.
Of the many books and articles I’ve read on retirement planning, one that
makes particular sense is Work Less, Live More by Bob Clyatt (Nolo). The
author suggests something he calls the “95% Rule.” It starts with a retirement
plan that incorporates a reasonable rate of withdrawal: Clyatt conservatively
says 4 percent, maybe 4.5 percent of your initial portfolio ($24,000 to $27,000
a year on a $600,000 portfolio), adjusted each year for inflation. However, if
the markets turn sour in any particular year or years, you economize a bit
that year or years by withdrawing no more than 95 percent of what you with-
drew the previous year. “You’ll tighten your belt somewhat, but you won’t
turn your world upside down,” writes Clyatt.
Clyatt’s number-crunching tells him that if you follow the 95% Rule, a 50 per-
cent stock and 50 percent bond portfolio, starting with an initial year with-
drawal of 4.5 percent and adjusting for inflation, has a 92 percent chance of
lasting 30 years. Those aren’t bad odds.

Chapter 18: Finding Comfort and Security in Old Age

Making the Most Use 
of Uncle Sam’s Gifts
The Internal Revenue Service, in cahoots with Congress, gives the U.S.
investor two basic kinds of tax-advantaged retirement accounts:
 Plans that allow for the deferral of income tax until the money is with-
drawn (IRAs, SEP-IRAs, 401k plans).
 Plans that, provided you follow certain rules, allow for tax-free with-
drawals after reaching age 591⁄2 (Roth IRAs, Roth 401k plans).
I won’t get into the many rules and regulations and the amount that you can
stash in each kind of account. That information is readily available elsewhere,
and it strays a bit from the focus of this book. Instead, I want to discuss in
which account you should place your bond allocation and, should you be in
the withdrawal phase of your investing career, from which account you
should yank your cash.
Minimizing income is 
the name of the game
Interest payments from bonds or bond funds (other than municipal bonds, as
I discuss in Chapter 8) are generally taxable as normal income. In contrast,
the money you make off stocks, whether dividends or capital gains, is usually
taxed at 15 percent. It makes sense, especially if you are in a higher-than-15
percent tax bracket, to keep your bonds in a tax-advantaged retirement
account. Even if you are in the 15 percent bracket, this plan still makes sense
because bond income, regular and steady, is taxed regardless of whether you
withdraw it or not. Stock appreciation (capital gains) is taxed only when you
sell, although stock held in mutual funds may incur capital gains when the
fund sells, even if you don’t.
When allocating your portfolio, keep in mind at all times that money in your
401(k) or IRA will eventually be taxed as regular income. Say you decide that
you want a 30 percent allocation to bonds, and all of those bonds are in your
IRA. If you are within four or five years of withdrawing some of that money,
you may want to make the actual allocation of bonds somewhat higher. I can’t
give you an exact figure because I don’t know your tax bracket and I don’t
know what kind of capital gains taxes you’ll pay when you cash out of your
taxable accounts. But you may, for example, allocate 35 percent or 45 percent
of your portfolio to bonds.
284
Part V: Bonds As Replacements for the Old Paycheck 

If you have various retirement accounts with more space than you need for
just your bond allocation, put the bonds in the tax-deferred accounts and put
potentially higher-yielding assets, like stocks, in your tax-free accounts, such
as your Roth IRA. That’s because the Roth IRA does not require you to start
taking minimum required distributions at age 701⁄2, so you might as well fuel
up your Roth with assets that can really grow over the years.
Lowering your tax bracket 
through smart withdrawals
At age 701⁄2, you have to start taking something from your 401(k) or your regu-
lar or rollover IRA; it’s the law. (See the sidebar “Missing the minimum
required distribution — don’t!”) But prior to that age, and to a certain degree
after that age, where you take your cash from — whether from your 401(k),
IRA, Roth IRA, or taxable account — will be up to your discretion.
How to best use that discretion?
285
Chapter 18: Finding Comfort and Security in Old Age
Missing the minimum required 
distribution — don’t!
I’m very happy to live in a country where people
who break the law are given due process and,
if found guilty of a crime, neither have their
limbs removed nor are stoned to death. And yet
we have the minimum required distribution
(MRD) on 401(k) plans and regular and rollover
IRAs, and woe is you if you miscalculate! You
won’t be stoned, but your finances will certainly
be pummeled hard.
Of course, the calculation is easy, says the IRS!
You simply take your retirement account’s start-
ing balance as of December 31 of the prior year,
and you divide that number by your “life-
expectancy factor,” which is found in IRS 
publication 590, available on the IRS Web site
(www.irs.gov). Don’t get it wrong! The
penalty for taking less than your minimum
required distribution is brutal. If you withdraw
less than the minimum required amount, the IRS
can nail you for a sum equal to 50 percent of the
amount of the MRD not taken.
MRDs generally begin at age 701⁄2. If you feel
uncomfortable doing the calculation yourself, a
retirement specialist at the brokerage house
where you have your retirement account will
help you, or you can ask your tax guru.
Caution: There is an entirely different table for
MRDs on inherited IRAs. Lots of people mess up
there, with potentially expensive consequences.

Balance, Grasshopper, balance. Most likely, you want to pull from your tax-
deferred retirement accounts only to the point that doing so doesn’t push
you into a higher tax bracket. At that point, supplement that cash with
money from your Roth account or from your taxable brokerage account.
For example, if you are a single guy or gal withdrawing $40,000 a year from
your portfolio, consider taking the first $30,650 from your 401(k) or IRA. That
amount (according to the 2006 federal tax schedule), and no more, keeps you
squarely in the 15 percent tax bracket. Show any more income, and your
incremental income will be taxed at 25 percent — a two-thirds increase in tax!
Solution: Withdraw the remaining $9,350 ($40,000 – $30,650) from either your
Roth or your taxable brokerage account, and you’ll keep yourself in the 15
percent bracket.
Having retirement money that is both taxable and tax-free is known in the
financial planning world as tax diversification. It makes a lot of sense.
Caveat: If you have mucho bucks — more than the federal estate tax exemp-
tion (which varies year to year) — the rules change. Your heirs will generally
fare much better inheriting money outside of your IRA or 401(k) than money
within. It may make sense, in your case, to well exceed your minimum
required distributions, take the tax hit, but spare your heirs from having to
pay a hefty estate tax plus income tax. Talk to an estate planning attorney, tax
accountant, or financial planner before setting up your withdrawal strategy.
Oh, and Roth money is a great gift for your heirs.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
You have now arrived at The Part of Tens, a classic
feature in all Dummies books that offers fun and prac-
tical lists chock full of takeaway information. I begin with
the ten most common misconceptions about bonds —
some of them rather huge misconceptions that I’ve seen
carried even by some very experienced investors. I then
present ten mistakes that bond investors often make,
some potentially quite costly. And I wrap up this section
with ten Q&As with Dan Fuss of Loomis, Sayles &
Company, without any question one of the most 
successful bond managers of our age.

Chapter 19
Ten Most Common
Misconceptions about Bonds
In This Chapter
 Deciphering the jargon
 Debunking some myths
 Recognizing gross oversimplifications
A
scoop of lake water in your hands, clear and cloistered, unmoving,
looks like the very essence of simplicity. And yet, a dab under the high-
powered microscope reveals an entire world of complex organisms wiggling
and squiggling about in your palms.
A bond selling for 100 and paying 5 percent looks like the clearest, most easy-
to-understand investment possible. Yet it is, in reality, a much more complex
organism. Scoop through these ten common bond misconceptions and you’ll
no doubt see what I’m talking about.
A Bond “Selling for 100” Costs $100
Welcome to the first complexity in bonds: jargon! When a bond broker says
that he or she has a bond “selling for 100,” it means that the bond is selling
not for $100, but for $1,000. If that same bond were “selling for 95,” it would
be on the market for $950. If it were “selling for 105,” it could be bought 
for $1,050.
Ready for more jargon?

The par value or face value of a $1,000 bond is $1,000. But the market value
depends on whether it is selling for 95, 100, 105, or whatever. In addition, that
$1,000 face bond may be said to “pay 5 percent,” but that doesn’t mean you’ll
get 5 percent on your money! It means you’ll get 5 percent on the par value:
that is, 5 percent on $1,000, or $50 a year, which may mean a return of greater
or less than 5 percent to you. If you paid 105 for the bond (that’s called a 
premium), you’ll actually be making less than 5 percent on your money. If you
paid 95 for the bond (that’s called a discount), you’ll be making more than 5
percent on your money.
Confused? Turn to Chapter 4.
Buying a Bond at a Discount Is Better
Than Paying a Premium, Duh
Duh, yourself. Sometimes, you get what you pay for.
Discounted bonds sell at a discount for a reason; premium bonds sell at a
premium for a reason. Here’s the reason: Those premium bonds typically
have higher coupon rates than prevailing coupon rates. Discount bonds, in
contrast, typically have lower coupon rates than prevailing coupon rates. In
both theory and in practice, two bonds with similar ratings and similar matu-
rities, all other things being equal, will have similar yields-to-maturity (the
yield that really matters) whether sold at a premium or a discount.
Example: Bond A, issued in 2000, has a coupon rate of 4 percent. Bond B,
issued in 2007, has a coupon rate of 8 percent. Everything else about the
bonds is the same: same issuer, same maturity date (let’s say 2020), same
callability. Currently, similar bonds are paying 6 percent. You would fully
expect Bond A to sell at a discount and Bond B to sell at a premium. In both
cases you would expect their yields-to-maturity to be roughly 6 percent.
A Bond Paying X% Today Will Pocket
You X% Over the Life of the Bond
A bond paying a coupon rate of 5 percent may (if the bound is purchased at a
discount) be yielding something higher, like, say, 6 percent. But each six
months, as you collect that 6 percent on your money, you’ll either spend it or
290
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

reinvest it. If you reinvest it at an even higher rate of interest (suppose inter-
est rates are going up) — say 8 percent — then your total return on your
money, over time, will be higher than both the coupon rate of 5 percent and
the current yield of 6 percent. If you sell the bond before maturity, the price
you get for it (the market value of the bond at the time) will also be factored
into your total return.
In sum, the total return on the money you invest in bonds is often unknow-
able. Bonds are not at all as predictable as they seem at first glance!
Rising Interest Rates Are Good 
(or Bad) for Bondholders
In general, rising interest rates are good for future bondholders (who will see
higher coupon payments); for those who presently own bonds, rising interest
rates may not be so good, because rising interest rates push bond prices
down. (Who is going to want to buy your bond paying 5 percent when other
bonds are suddenly paying 6 percent?)
On the other hand, rising interest rates allow present bondholders to re-
invest their money (the coupon payments that arrive twice a year) for a
higher return.
In the end, however, what matters most for bondholders both present and
future is the real rate of interest, after tax. The real rate of interest is the nom-
inal rate minus the rate of inflation. You’d rather get 6 percent on a bond
when inflation is running at 2 percent than 10 percent on a bond when infla-
tion is running at 8 percent — especially after taxes, which tax the nominal
rate and ignore inflation.
Certain Bonds (Such as Treasuries) 
Are Completely Safe
Our national government has been spending money like a drunken sailor on
payday. But the U.S. government can also print money and raise taxes. So
there isn’t much chance of Uncle Sam defaulting on his debt — that’s true.
Treasuries are not completely safe, however. They are still subject to all the
other risks that bonds face. I’m talking about inflation risk and interest-rate
risk.
291
Chapter 19: Ten Most Common Misconceptions about Bonds

Don’t know what those risks are? You’d better read Chapter 10 before plunk-
ing your entire savings in Treasury bonds.
Bonds Are a Retiree’s Best Friend
Rely on an all fixed-income portfolio to replace your paycheck, and you’d
better have an awfully big portfolio or you risk running out of funds. Bonds,
unfortunately, have a long-term track record of outpacing inflation by only a
modest margin. If you plan on a long retirement, that wee bit of extra gravy
may not be enough to get you through the rest of your life without resorting
to an awfully tight budget. The retiree’s best friend is a diversified portfolio
that has both stocks (for growth potential) and bonds (for stability), with
maybe some real estate and a smattering of commodities.
For further discussion on shaping your post-paycheck portfolio for maximum
longevity, see Part V.
Individual Bonds Are Usually a 
Better Deal than Bond Funds
Some of the newer exchange-traded funds offer an instant diversified bond
portfolio with a total expense ratio of peanuts — in the case of Vanguard
bond ETFs, we’re looking at 0.11 percent per year. These ETFs are excellent
ways to invest in bonds. Many other bond funds offer professional manage-
ment with reasonable expenses and impressive long-term performance
records.
Buying individual bonds may be the better route for some investors, but the
decision is rarely a slam-dunk, especially for those investors with bond portfo-
lios of, oh, $350,000 or less. Less than that, and it may be hard to diversify a
portfolio of individual bonds, and the markups you’ll pay on your modest buys
and sells may be significantly more than you would pay for a bond fund —
especially if you wind up not keeping the bond till maturity.
Chapter 14 provides greater insight into the question of individual bonds
versus bond funds.
292
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Municipal Bonds Are Free of Taxation
Most income from municipal bonds is free from federal income tax. But the
income from many municipal bonds is taxed at the local and state level, espe-
cially if you buy bonds that were issued outside of your own backyard. If you
see a capital gain on the sale of a muni or muni fund, that will be taxed the
same way any other capital gain would be. And some municipal-bond income
is subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), designed so that those who
make six figures and more can’t deduct their way out of paying any tax.
Do municipal bonds make sense for you? The tax question is the primary
one. Unfortunately, it isn’t as straightforward as it looks.
Don’t invest in munis, which pay much lower rates of interest than do taxable
bonds, without having the entire picture. Crunch the numbers. Talk to your
tax guru. Read Chapter 8.
A Discount Broker Sells Bonds Cheaper
Sometimes — often — a discount broker will have the best deals on bonds,
but sometimes not. That’s especially true for new offers on municipal bonds
and corporate bonds where a full-service broker may actually be packaging
the bond for the public. It always pays to shop around.
The Biggest Risk in Bonds Is the 
Risk of the Issuer Defaulting
Even in the world of corporate junk bonds, where the risk of default is as real
as dirt, I’m still not sure if actual default qualifies as the biggest risk that
bondholders take. Maybe sometimes. But investors in general focus too
much on default risk. A bond can also lose plenty of market value if the issu-
ing company is simply downgraded by one of the major credit ratings agen-
cies. Most commonly, however, a bond’s principal crashes if interest rates
soar. No matter how credit-worthy the issuer, a swift rise in interest rates will
cause your bond’s value to dip. That’s not a big issue if, however, you hold an
individual bond till maturity.

Ten Mistakes That Most 
Bond Investors Make
In This Chapter
 Giving the middlemen too much money
 Relying on sketchy research
 Adding too much risk to your portfolio
 Overcomplicating matters
I
nvesting in bonds is easy. Investing well in bonds is hard. The hard part, in
good measure, is that there are some very hungry middlemen out there
more than willing to share in your profits. In addition, bonds, by their very
nature, can be more complicated than they appear. It’s easy to get bamboo-
zled, easy to make dumb mistakes. But if you watch out very carefully for the
following ten do’s and don’ts, you’ll be far ahead of the game.
Allowing the Broker to Churn You
Bond brokers generally make their money when you buy and sell bonds.
They rarely make anything while the bonds are simply sitting in your
account, collecting interest. Largely for that reason, your broker may find
many reasons to call you with special deals, and perhaps reasons that a bond
issue he sold you last year is — ooops! — no longer worthy of holding.
In truth, it rarely, rarely happens that a bond you were sold last year is no
longer worth holding. Company was downgraded by the major ratings agen-
cies? You probably already lost whatever money you’re likely to lose; selling
the bond now will result in your locking in that loss. Why not hold the bond
till maturity, if that was your original plan? Interest rates have risen or fallen?
Yeah, so? Don’t they always? Bond B has a more favorable tax status than
Bond A? Well, why weren’t you told that when you bought Bond A?

I won’t say that there is never a good reason to swap one bond for another.
But you are almost always going to be better off as a buy-and-hold-till-
maturity investor than you are riding the bond merry-go-round. If your
broker calls with reasons to buy or sell, ask lots of questions and make sure
you get clear answers as to why it is to your benefit, not his, to start trading.
Not Taking Advantage of TRACE
Buying and selling bonds is more transparent than ever before. That means
that lots of information is available, if you know where to look. Up till just a
few years ago, a bond broker could charge you any kind of markup her heart
desired, and you would have no idea what that markup was. Now, with a
system called TRACE (the Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine), you can
go online and within moments see how much your broker paid for the bonds
she’s now offering to sell you. Conversely, if your broker sells some bonds for
you, you can find out how much she sold them for. You have a right to know.
At the same time you’re checking TRACE to see what the broker is looking to
score, you’ll be able to compare the yield on a prospective bond purchase
with the yields of comparable bonds. In fact, the better yield on comparable
bonds will often result from a lesser markup by the middleman. The two are
closely intertwined.
See Chapter 15 for complete instructions on checking a bond’s price history
and the yield on comparable bonds.
Choosing a Bond Fund Based 
on Short-Term Performance
A mutual fund’s performance figures, especially going back for any period of
less than, say, three years, can often look very impressive, but it may not
mean squat. In most cases, a mutual fund’s performance, especially over
such a short time period, has more to do with the kind of mutual fund it is
rather than any managerial prowess. If, for example, high-yield bonds have
had a great year, most high-yield bond funds will see impressive performance.
If foreign bonds have had a great year, foreign-bond funds will rally as a
group. If interest rates have recently taken a nosedive, all bond funds will
likely look good.
296
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

What matters most isn’t raw performance but performance in relation to
other similar funds and, even more so, performance over the long haul — five
years and beyond. See Chapter 16 for more tips on choosing the best bond
fund or funds for your portfolio.
Not Looking Closely Enough 
at a Bond Fund’s Expenses
Bonds historically haven’t returned enough to warrant very high manage-
ment expense ratios on bond funds. But that certainly hasn’t stopped some
bond-fund managers from slapping on high fees. If you look at the perform-
ance of bond funds in the long run, the least expensive funds typically do the
best. Don’t pay a lot for a bond fund.
Going Through a Middleman 
to Buy Treasuries
Through the U.S. government’s own Web site — www.treasurydirect.gov
— you can buy any and all kinds of Treasury bonds without paying any
markup or fees whatsoever. You don’t need a broker. The Web site is easy to
navigate, and everything (including the bond holding itself) is electronic. See
Chapter 5 for more on investing in Treasury bonds.
Counting Too Much on High-Yield Bonds
High-yield (junk) bonds look sweet. Historically, they offer higher returns
than other bonds. But the return on high-yield bonds is still much less than
the return you can expect on stocks. It may not be worth the added risk of
getting an extra couple of percentage points to hold high-yield bonds.
The main role of bonds in a portfolio is to provide ballast. That’s not to say
that the interest payments from bonds aren’t important — they certainly are.
But, above all, bonds should be there for you if your other investments,
297
Chapter 20: Ten Mistakes That Most Bond Investors Make

including stocks, have a bad year or few years. Unfortunately, junk bonds
don’t provide that ballast. When the economy sours and stocks sink, junk
bonds typically sink right along with all your other investments. Investment-
grade bonds, such as Treasuries, agency bonds, most munis, and high-quality
corporates, usually hold their own and often rise in value when the going
gets rough.
Paying Too Much Attention 
to the Yield Curve
There are times when short-term bonds, even money market funds (built on
very short-term debt instruments), yield as much as intermediate or long-
term bonds. During these times, the yield curve is said to be flat. Flatness in
the yield curve entices many people to move their money from long-term to
short-term bonds. In a way, it makes perfect sense. Why tie your money up
and take the greater risk that comes with long-term bonds if you aren’t get-
ting compensated for it?
But I would argue that longer-term bonds still belong in your portfolio, even
when the yield curve is flat. Remember that the main point of bonds in your
portfolio isn’t to provide kick-ass returns. That’s the job of stocks. The main
job of bonds is to provide your portfolio some lift when most of your hold-
ings are sagging. If the economy hits the skids and stocks suddenly plummet,
chances are good that long-term, high quality bonds will be the place a lot of
money goes. Interest rates will drop. Long-term, investment-grade bonds will
soar, and you’ll wish you were there.
Buying Bonds That Are Too Complicated
Mortgage-backed bonds, reverse convertible bonds, catastrophe bonds . . .
there are bonds and bond products out there that promise far more than
simple interest. But in the end, many retail investors who get involved wind
up disappointed. Keep it simple. Really. There’s no such thing as a free lunch,
and any bond or bond product that pays you more than plain vanilla bonds is
doing so for a reason. There is risk involved that you may not see unless you
squint.
298
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Ignoring Inflation and Taxation
If you’re making 5 percent on your bonds, and you’re losing 3 percent to infla-
tion, you’re about 2 percent ahead of the game . . . for a brief moment. But
you’ll likely be taxed on the 5 percent.
Inflation and taxation can eat seriously into your bond interest payments.
That’s not a reason not to invest in bonds. But when doing any kind of projec-
tions, counting your bond returns but ignoring inflation and taxation is like
visiting Nome in winter and trying to ignore the snow.
Relying Too Heavily on 
Bonds in Retirement
If this were a chapter on the ten most common mistakes that stock investors
make, I would advise readers that they must invest in bonds as well as
stocks. But this is a chapter on the ten most common mistakes that bond
investors make, so I must caution that an all-bond portfolio rarely makes
sense.
Stocks offer a greater potential for long-term return and a better chance of
staying ahead of inflation than bonds. They also tend to move in different
cycles than bonds, providing delicious diversification. They help dampen
volatility and smooth out a portfolio’s long-term returns, thereby potentially
boosting long-term returns. Stocks and bonds complement each other like
spaghetti and sauce.

average taxable bond fund — is the Loomis Sayles Bond Fund. At the helm of

Dan Fuss, who is also vice chairman of the Boston-based Loomis, Sayles &
Company. He has been managing investments for nearly half a century. 
I thought it appropriate that this final chapter of Bond Investing For Dummies
offer a few words from a guy who obviously knows fixed income . . . perhaps
better than anyone.
Q. Dan, to what do you attribute your incredible success as a bond
investor?
A. As you drive to work in the morning and you look around you, you get a
sense for what season it is. Just as the calendar has seasons, there are also sea-
sons of the economy, what one can also refer to as “cycles.” These can greatly
affect bond returns. One advantage I have is being older than the hills . . . I’ve
seen a good number of seasons, and I can perhaps recognize them a little
better or quicker than most. While I’m looking out for changes in the seasons, 
I also look at individual bond issuers and how the change of seasons is likely to
affect them. “Breezy-Weezy Widget Company,” for example, might do better in a
hot season than cold.

Q. What would you say is the most common mistake that bond investors
make?
If we’re talking about investors in individual bonds, the most common mis-
take is not diversifying enough. I don’t think it is even possible to diversify
adequately unless you have a bond portfolio of considerable size . . . $100,000
for Treasury bonds, $200,000 for municipals, and if you’re investing in corpo-
rate bonds, you’d better have at least $1 million to invest — and lots of time
to invest in research, and a broker you really know and trust. Otherwise,
you’re bound to take too much risk on individual issues, and you’re going to
get eaten alive with fees.
Q. And what about investors in bond funds? What do you see as their most
common or most fatal mistake?
There, I’d say the greatest mistake is buying an undifferentiated, general
market–correlated fund — almost a “closet” index fund — with high expense
ratios. If you’re going to be paying a bond manager to manage your bond
portfolio, you want that manager to really manage. You don’t want that man-
ager simply buying the market, because the market is full of terrible bonds
that might make perfect sense for the companies issuing them and the bro-
kerage houses selling them, but make no sense for investors.
Q. What is your prediction as to what the total return on bonds and stocks
will be over the next ten years?
Prediction? Let’s not use that word! My guess is that both bonds and stocks
will return about 6 percent a year over the next decade, but stock returns will
bounce around a lot more than bonds.
Q. So you’re saying that bond returns are likely to be slightly higher than
their historical average, and stock returns will be considerably lower. On
what are you basing those predictions, er, guesses?
Mostly on the growing U.S. federal deficit. That will require greater borrowing
by the Treasury, which will tend to force up interest rates. In the long term,
such as ten years, rising interest rates will be a good thing for bond investors
and not such a good thing for stock investors. But I’m looking at other fac-
tors, too, including the currently high valuations of most U.S. companies, and
the prospect of a higher corporate income tax.
Q. So if you reckon that stocks and bonds are going to return about the
same in future years, and bonds are going to be much less volatile, are you
then advocating all-bond portfolios?
I like bonds, but a diversified portfolio with both bonds and stocks still makes
sense! First, my guesses about returns could be totally wrong! Second, stock
and bond returns will likely continue, as they have in the past, to move up and
302
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

down in different cycles. Third, if you know what you’re doing, you can add a
whole lot more return on the stock side by focusing on specific risks.
Q. What about the yield curve, the relationship between long-term bond
interest rates and short-term bond interest rates? It’s been awfully flat
lately, which means that a lot of people have been putting their money in
short-term bonds. Does that make sense?
It’s true that short-term bonds are less volatile than long-term bonds. So if
they are paying relatively the same rate of interest, it may seem logical to
restrict your investments to the short-term. But that would be a mistake.
Look at all the people who invested short-term in the early 2000s. Interest
rates started to go down, down, down, and their returns spiraled down to
almost nothing. There’s something to be said for locking in longer interest
rates, because you never can tell which direction interest rates will move. If
interest rates move up instead of down, you’re not going to want everything
tied up in long-term, either. Laddering — buying both short-term and long-
term fixed income — makes sense in any kind of interest-rate environment.
Q. What is the best place to invest right now for people who are most 
concerned with safety?
There are no completely safe places in the bond market. The risk of capital
loss is minimal if you invest in short-term Treasuries, but you have maximum
reinvestment risk. If you invest in 30-year Treasury zero-coupons, there is no
reinvestment risk, but there is certainly a lot of risk to the value of your prin-
cipal. With corporate bonds, of course, there are all kinds of additional risks.
The greatest safety, now and always, can be found in diversification.
Q. What tips do you have for someone shopping for a bond fund . . . other
than choosing Loomis Sayles, of course!
The expense ratio needs to be reasonable: Less than 0.50 percent for a
Treasury fund . . . not much more than 1.0 percent for anything else. There
should be limited turnover. Turnover costs you money — I’d be wary of any
kind of flipping over 80 percent a year. Look for a fund with a long-term posi-
tive track record, and make sure that the same manager or team that earned
that track record is still the one running the show. Perhaps most importantly,
make sure you know what you’re buying. For most investors, multi-sector
bond funds will make the most sense. Beware that there are many so-called
“strategic income” funds out there that sound like multi-sector bond funds,
but they may really be balanced funds with exposure to equity as well as
fixed-income investments. Read the prospectus!

Chapter 21: Ten Q & A’s with Bond Guru Dan Fuss

Q. You’ve talked of diversification and you’ve used the word “multi-sector.”
How diversified should investors be? And how “multi” is “multi” where
bonds are concerned?
A diversified portfolio will have both equity investments and bonds. If munis
make sense from a tax vantage point, I like to see a good array of municipal
issues. If taxable bonds make more sense, I like to see a mix of Treasuries,
corporate bonds, agencies, mortgage-backed, and international. Each cate-
gory will do better at different times. As much as everyone likes to make 
predictions, you never know what’s coming around the corner.

tried my best to make this book as up-to-date as possi-

also Web sites that can help you make the essential con-
