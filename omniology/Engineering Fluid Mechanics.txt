Dimensions and Units
Any physical situation, whether it involves a single object or a complete system, can be described in terms 
of a number of recognisable properties which the object or system possesses. For example, a moving 
object could be described in terms of its mass, length, area or volume, velocity and acceleration. Its 
temperature or electrical properties might also be of interest, while other properties – such as density 
and viscosity of the medium through which it moves – would also be of importance, since they would 
affect its motion. These measurable properties used to describe the physical state of the body or system 
are known as its variables, some of which are basic such as length and time, others are derived such 
as velocity. Each variable has units to describe the magnitude of that quantity. Lengths in SI units are 
described in units of meters. The “Meter” is the unit of the dimension of length (L); hence the area will 
have dimension of L2, and volume L3. Time will have units of seconds (T), hence velocity is a derived 
quantity with dimensions of (LT-1) and units of meter per second. A list of some variables is given in 
Table 1 with their units and dimensions.

Preface
Definitions of Some Basic SI Units
Mass:	 	
The kilogram is the mass of a platinum-iridium cylinder kept at Sevres in France.
Length:		
The metre is now defined as being equal to 1 650 763.73 wavelengths in vacuum of the 
orange line emitted by the Krypton-86 atom.
Time:	 	
The second is defined as the fraction 1/31 556 925.975 of the tropical year for 1900. 
The second is also declared to be the interval occupied by 9 192 631 770 cycles of the 
radiation of the caesium atom corresponding to the transition between two closely 
spaced ground state energy levels.
Temperature:	
The Kelvin is the degree interval on the thermodynamic scale on which the temperature 
of the triple point of water is 273.16 K exactly. (The temperature of the ice point is 
273.15 K).
Definitions of Some Derived SI Units
Force:	
The Newton is that force which, when acting on a mass of one kilogram gives it an acceleration of one 
metre per second per second.
Work Energy, and Heat:
The joule is the work done by a force of one Newton when its point of application is moved through a 
distance of one metre in the direction of the force. The same unit is used for the measurement of every 
kind of energy including quantity of heat.
The Newton metre, the joule and the watt second are identical in value. It is recommended that the 
Newton is kept for the measurement of torque or moment and the joule or watt second is used for 
quantities of work or energy.

Fluid Properties
Fluid
A fluid is a substance, which deforms when subjected to a force. A fluid can offer no permanent resistance 
to any force causing change of shape. Fluid flow under their own weight and take the shape of any solid 
body with which they are in contact. Fluids may be divided into liquids and gases. Liquids occupy 
definite volumes. Gases will expand to occupy any containing vessel.
S.I Units in Fluids
The dimensional unit convention adopted in this course is the System International or S.I system. In this 
convention, there are 9 basic dimensions. The three applicable to this unit are: mass, length and time. 
The corresponding units are kilogrammes (mass), metres (length), and seconds (time). All other fluid 
units may be derived from these.

Fluid Statics
Density
The density of a fluid is its mass per unit volume and the SI unit is kg/m3. Fluid density is temperature 
dependent and to a lesser extent it is pressure dependent. For example the density of water at sea-level 
and 4oC is 1000 kg/m3, whilst at 50oC it is 988 kg/m3.
The relative density (or specific gravity) is the ratio of a fluid density to the density of a standard reference 
fluid maintained at the same temperature and pressure:

Viscosity
Viscosity is a measure of a fluid’s resistance to flow. The viscosity of a liquid is related to the ease with 
which the molecules can move with respect to one another. Thus the viscosity of a liquid depends on the: 
•	 Strength of attractive forces between molecules, which depend on their composition, size, 
and shape. 
•	 The kinetic energy of the molecules, which depend on the temperature.

Fluid Statics
Viscosity is not a strong function of pressure; hence the effects of pressure on viscosity can be neglected. 
However, viscosity depends greatly on temperature. For liquids, the viscosity decreases with temperature, 
whereas for gases, the viscosity increases with temperature. For example, crude oil is often heated to a 
higher temperature to reduce the viscosity for transport.
Consider the situation below, where the top plate is moved by a force F moving at a constant rate of 
V (m/s).

The shear stress τ is given by:
τ = F/A
The rate of deformation dv (or the magnitude of the velocity component) will increase with distance 
above the fixed plate. Hence:
τ = constant x (dv / dy)
where the constant of proportionality is known as the Dynamic viscosity (µ) of the particular fluid 
separating the two plates. 
τ = µ x (V / y)
Where V is the velocity of the moving plate, and y is the distance separating the two plates. The units 
of dynamic viscosity are kg/ms or Pa s. A non-SI unit in common usage is the poise where 1 poise = 
10-1 kg/ms
Kinematic viscosity (ν) is defined as the ratio of dynamic viscosity to density.
i.e. ν = μ / ρ

Worked Example 1.1
The temperature dependence of liquid viscosity is the phenomenon by which liquid viscosity tends to 
decrease as its temperature increases. Viscosity of water can be predicted with accuracy to within 2.5% 
from 0°C to 370°C by the following expression:
μ (kg/ms)= 2.414*10^-5 * 10^(247.8 K/(Temp – 140 K))
Calculate the dynamic viscosity and kinematic viscosity of water at 20oC respectively. You may assume 
that water is incompressible, and its density is 1000 kg/m3.
Compare the result with that you find from the viscosity chart and comment on the difference.
Solution
a)	 Using the expression given:
	
	
μ (kg/ms)	
= 2.414*10 -5 * 10(247.8 K/(Temp – 140 K))
	
	
	
	
= 2.414x10-5x10(247.8/(20+273-140)
	
	
	
	
= 1.005x10-3 kg/ms

Fluid Pressure
Fluid pressure is the force exerted by the fluid per unit area. Fluid pressure is transmitted with equal 
intensity in all directions and acts normal to any plane. In the same horizontal plane the pressure 
intensities in a liquid are equal. In the SI system the units of fluid pressure are Newtons/m2 or Pascals, 
where 1 N/m2 = 1 Pa.
i.e.	
A
F
P =

(1.2)
Many other pressure units are commonly encountered and their conversions are detailed below:-
1 bar	 	
	
	
=105 N/m2
1 atmosphere	 	
	
= 101325 N/m2
1 psi (1bf/in2 – not SI unit) 	
= 6895 N/m2
1 Torr 	
	
	
= 133.3 N/m2
Terms commonly used in static pressure analysis include:
Pressure Head. The pressure intensity at the base of a column of homogenous fluid of a given height 
in metres.
Vacuum. A perfect vacuum is a completely empty space in which, therefore the pressure is zero.
Atmospheric Pressure. The pressure at the surface of the earth due to the head of air above the surface. 
At sea level the atmospheric pressure is about 101.325 kN/m2 (i.e. one atmosphere = 101.325 kN/m2 is 
used as units of pressure).
Gauge Pressure. The pressure measured above or below atmospheric pressure.
Absolute Pressure. The pressure measured above absolute zero or vacuum.
Absolute Pressure = Gauge Pressure + Atmospheric Pressure 
(1.3)
Vapour Pressure
When evaporation of a liquid having a free surface takes place within an enclosed space, the partial 
pressure created by the vapour molecules is called the vapour pressure. Vapour pressure increases 
with temperature.

Compressibility
A parameter describing the relationship between pressure and change in volume for a fluid.
A compressible fluid is one which changes its volume appreciably under the application of pressure. 
Therefore, liquids are virtually incompressible whereas gases are easily compressed.
The compressibility of a fluid is expressed by the bulk modulus of elasticity (E), which is the ratio of the 
change in unit pressure to the corresponding volume change per unit volume.

Pascal’s Law
Pascal’s law states that the pressure intensity at a point in a fluid at rest is the same in all directions. 
Consider a small prism of fluid of unit thickness in the z-direction contained in the bulk of the fluid 
as shown below. Since the cross-section of the prism is equilateral triangle, P3 is at an angle of 45o with 
the x-axis. If the pressure intensities normal to the three surfaces are P1, P2, P3 as shown then since:-

Force = Pressure x Area
Force on face 	AB = P1 x (AB x 1)
	
	
BC = P2 x (BC x 1)
	
	
AC = P3 x (AC x 1)
Resolving forces vertically:	
P1 x AB = P3 x AC cos θ
But	
AC cos θ = AB	 Therefore P1 = P3
Resolving forces horizontally: 
P2 x BC = P3 x AC sin 
But 	
AC sin θ = BC	 Therefore P2 = P3
Hence P1 = P2 = P3
(1.4)
In words: the pressure at any point is equal in all directions.

Fluid-Static Law
The fluid-static law states that the pressure in a fluid increases with increasing depth. In the case of water 
this is termed the hydrostatic law.

K
$
For vertical equilibrium of forces:
Force on base = Weight of Column of Fluid
Weight of column = mass x acceleration due to gravity W = m.g
the mass of the fluid column = its density x volume, 
the volume of the column = Area (A) of the base x height of the column (h);
the weight of the column = ρ x A x h x g
Force = Pressure x Area = P x A
Hence:	 P x A = ρ x A x h x g
Divide both sides by the area A, 	
P = ρ g h

Pressure Measurement
In general, sensors used to measure the pressure of a fluid are called pressure transducers. A Transducer 
is a device that, being activated by energy from the fluid system, in itself responds in a manner related 
to the magnitude of the applied pressure. There are essentially two different ways of measuring the 
pressure at a point in a fluid whether static or in motion. The essential feature of a pressure transducer 
is the elastic element which converts the signal from the pressure source into mechanical displacement 
(e.g. the Bourdon gauge). The second category has an electric element which converts the signal into 
an electrical output. The popularity of electric pressure transducers is due to their adaptability to be 
amplified, transmitted, controlled and stored.
The Bourdon gauge is a mechanical pressure measurement device that relies on a circular arc of elliptical 
cross-section tube (the Bourdon tube) closed at one end, changing shape to a circular cross-section under 
the action of fluid pressure. The resulting motion at the closed end is amplified by a gear arrangement to 
produce the movement of a pointer around a scale. The scale is normally calibrated to indicate pressure 
readings proportional to the deflection of the pointer.

Manometers:
The pressure is indicated by the displacement of the manometric fluid as high will be given the symbol

and manometer displacement can be established.

Applications of Pascal’s law
Two very useful devices based on Pascal’s law are hydraulic brakes and hydraulic lift shown below. The 
pressure applied by the foot on the break pedal is transmitted to the brake fluid contained in the master 
cylinder. This pressure is transmitted undiminished in all directions and acts through the brake pads on 
the wheel reducing the rotary motion to a halt. Sliding friction between the tyres and the road surface 
opposes the tendency of forward motion reducing the linear momentum to zero.

Fluid Statics
By means of hydraulic lifts, vehicles are lifted high on ramps for repairs and servicing. A force F applied 
on the cylinder of small area A, creates a pressure P=F/A which acts upwards on the ramp in the large 
cylinder of cross sectional area A’. The upward force acting on the ramp (being equal to F’= FA’/A) is 
much larger than the applied force F.

about the base of the gate:-

Resultant Force and Centre of Pressure on a Curved Surface in a Static Fluid
Systems involving curved submerged surfaces are analysed by considering the horizontal and vertical 
components of the resultant force.
1.	 The vertical component of the force is due to the weight of the fluid supported 	and acts 
through the centre of gravity of the fluid volume.
i.e. Fv = ρg Vol
(1.13)
2.	 The horizontal component of the force is equal to the normal force on the vertical 
projection of the surface. 
The force acts through the centre of gravity of the vertical projection.
i.e. FH = ρg hcA

If α is the angle of inclination of R to the horizontal then
tan α = FV/FH = 52 x 103/33.1 x 103	
i.e. α = 57.28o
Since static pressure acts normal to the surface, it can be deduced that the line of action of FR passes 
through the centre of curvature.
So the only force providing a moment is the weight of the gate.
Hence;
Moment = Force x distance = 6000 x 9.81 x 0.6 = 35300 Nm

Buoyancy
The buoyancy of a body immersed in a fluid is that property which will determine whether the body 
will sink, rise or float. Archimedes established the analysis over 2000 years ago. Archimedes reasoned 
that the volume of an irregular solid could be found by determining the apparent loss of weight when 
the body is totally immersed in a liquid of known density.
Archimedes principle states:-
1.	 “The upthrust (vertical force) experienced by a body immersed in a fluid equals the weight of 
the displaced fluid”
2.	 “A floating body displaces its own weight in the fluid in which it floats”.

Upthrust 
	
	
F = Pressure x Area
	
	
   = P x A
But	
	
P = ρ.g.h
Therefore,	
F = ρ.g.h.A
But	
the volume VL= h.A 
Therefore,	
F = ρ.g.VL
(1.17)
Buoyant force can be expressed as:
F(b) = W(air) – W(liquid) = d x g x VL
where d is the density of the liquid, g is the acceleration of gravity and v is the volume of the immersed 
object (or the immersed part of the body if it floats). Since W=mg, the apparent change in mass when 
submerged is
m – m(apparent) = d(liquid) x vL

A hydrogen filled balloon has a total weight force of 9.5 kN. If the tension in the mooring cable anchoring 
the balloon to the ground is 15.75 kN, determine the upthrust experienced by the balloon and its volume.

Displaced volume VL = W x D x L = 0.1 x 0.25 x 0.5 = 0.0125 m3
For stable condition – Upthrust = weight force or 	
F = W
The Upthrust due to Buoyancy = ρseawater g VL
The total weight = (mcan + msand) x 9.81
Therefore: 	
ρseawater g VL. = (mcan + msand) x 9.81
1030 x 9.81 x 0.0125 = (1.0 + msand) x 9.81
Solving		
msand = 11.87 kg
Note: The sand will need to be levelled off or the can will not float vertically and may even be unstable.

Stability of floating bodies
A body is in a stable equilibrium if it returns to its original position after being slightly displaced. Neutral 
position if the object remains in the new position after being slightly displaced. A body is in an unstable 
equilibrium if it continues to move in the direction of the displacement.

If the Centre of Buoyancy (B) is defined as the centre of gravity of the displaced fluid then the stability 
of a floating object will depend on whether a righting or overturning moment is developed when the 
centre of gravity (G) and the centre of buoyancy move out of vertical alignment due to the shifting of 
the position of the latter. The centre of buoyancy moves because if a floating body tips, the shape of the 
displaced liquid changes.
Position (a) Figure 1.7, illustrates a stable condition, where the forces of Buoyancy thrust and the weight 
are equal and in line; while in Figure 1.7 (b) the body has been tipped over and the buoyancy has a 
new position B, with G unchanged. The vertical through the new centre of buoyancy cuts the original 
line, which is still passing through G at M, a point known as the Metacentre. In this case M lies above 
G, and stability exists. 
If M lies below G (c), it can be shown that once the body is tipped the couple introduced will aggravate the 
rolling, causing it to tip further away from its stable position. The body is said to be unstable. Therefore, 
for stability the metacentre must be above the centre of gravity, i.e. M above G.

King Hero ordered a new crown to be made from pure gold (density = 19200 kg/m3). When he received 
the crown he suspected that other metals may have been used in the construction. Archimedes discovered 
that the crown needed a force of 20.91 N to suspend when submersed in water and that it displaced 
3.1x10-4 m3 of water. He concluded that the crown could not be pure gold. Do you agree or disagree?

Definitions
Fluid Dynamics
The study of fluids in motion.
Static Pressure
The pressure at a given point exerted by the static head of the fluid present directly above that point. 
Static pressure is related to motion on a molecular scale.
Dynamic or Velocity Pressure
Dynamic pressure is related to fluid motion on a large scale i.e. fluid velocity.
Stagnation Pressure Total Pressure
The sum of the static pressure plus the dynamic pressure of a fluid at a point.
Streamline
An imaginary line in a moving fluid across which, at any instant, no fluid is flowing. ie it indicates the 
instantaneous direction of the flow.
Figure 2.1 the stream tube
Stream tube
A ‘bundle’ of neighbouring streamlines may be imagined to form a stream tube (not necessarily circular) 
through which the fluid flows.
Control volume
A fixed volume in space through which a fluid is continuously flowing. The boundary of a control volume 
is termed the control surface. The size and shape is entirely arbitrary and normally chosen such that it 
encloses part of the flow of particular interest.

Internal Fluid Flow
Classification of Fluid behaviour	
a)	 Steady or unsteady
A flow is termed steady if its properties do not vary with time. 
A flow is termed unsteady if properties at a given point vary with time. 
Quasi-steady flow is essentially unsteady but its properties change sufficiently slowly with 
respect to time, at a given point, that a series of steady state solutions will approximately 
represent the flow.
b)	 Uniform or Non-uniform
A uniform flow is one in which properties do not vary from point to point over a given 
cross-section.
Non-uniform flow has its properties changing with respect to space in a given cross-section.
c)	 One-dimensional or Multi-dimensional
One-dimensional flow, is one in which the direction and magnitude of the velocity at all points 
are identical. Variation of velocity in other directions is so small that they can be neglected. 
eg. flow of water in small bore pipe at low flow rates.
Two-dimensional flow is one in which the velocity has two main components.
Three-dimensional flow is one in which the flow velocity has significant components in all 
three directions.
d)	 Viscid or Inviscid
This some time distinguished as Viscid and inviscid flow in relation to the viscous forces 
whether they are neglected or taken into account
e)	 Compressible or Incompressible
If the changes in density are relatively small, the fluid is said to be incompressible. If the changes 
in density are appreciable, in case of the fluid being subjected to relatively high pressures, the 
fluid has to be treated as Compressible.
f)	 Ideal or Real
An ideal fluid is both inviscid and incompressible. This definition is useful in forming analytical 
solution to fluid flow problems.
Fluids in reality are viscous and compressible. Thus, the effect of compressibility and viscosity 
must be considered for accurate analysis. It must be stressed that in most common engineering 
applications at standard pressure and temperature, water can be assumed incompressible and 
inviscid. The assumption of ideal fluid can help to formulate a solution, an approximate solution, 
still better than no solution.

Conservation of Mass
The continuity equation applies the principle of conservation of mass to fluid flow. Consider a fluid 
flowing through a fixed volume tank having one inlet and one outlet as shown below.
Figure 2.2 conservation of mass
If the flow is steady i.e no accumulation of fluid within the tank, then the rate of fluid flow at entry 
must be equal to the rate of fluid flow at exit for mass conservation. If, at entry (or exit) having a cross-
sectional area A (m2), a fluid parcel travels a distance dL in time dt, then the volume flow rate (V, m3/s) 
is given by: V = (A . dL)/∆t
but since dL/∆t is the fluid velocity (v, m/s) we can write:	
	
Q = V x A

Internal Fluid Flow
The mass flow rate (m, kg/s) is given by the product of density and volume flow rate
i.e.	
	
m = ρ.Q = ρ .V.A
Between two points in flowing fluid for mass conservation we can write: 	
m1 = m2
or	
	
ρ1 V1 A1 = ρ2 V2 A2
(2.1)
If the fluid is incompressible i.e. ρ1 = ρ2 then:
V1A1 = V2A2
(2.2)
Hence an incompressible flow in a constant cross-section will have a constant velocity. For branched 
systems the continuity equation implies that the sum of the incoming fluid mass (or volume) flow rates 
must equal the sum of the outgoing mass (or volume) flow rates.
Worked Example 2.1
Air enters a compressor with a density of 1.2 kg/m3 at a mean velocity of 4 m/s in the 6 cm x 6 cm square 
inlet duct. Air is discharged from the compressor with a mean velocity of 3 m/s in a 5 cm diameter 
circular pipe. Determine the mass flow rate and the density at outlet.
Solution:
Given:	  ρ1 = 1.2 kg/m3, V1 = 4 m/s, V2 = 3 m/s
A1 = 0.06 x 0.06 = 0.0036 m2

Conservation of Energy
There are three forms of non-thermal energy for a fluid at any given point:-
The kinetic energy due to the motion of the fluid.
The potential energy due to the positional elevation above a datum.
The pressure energy, due to the absolute pressure of the fluid at that point.
Conservation of energy necessitates that the total energy of the fluid remains constant, however, there 
can be transformation from one form to another.

Flow Measurement 
There are a large number of devices for measuring fluid flow rates to suit different applications. Three 
of the most commonly encountered restriction methods will be presented here.
Restriction methods of fluid flow are based on the acceleration or deceleration of the fluid through some 
kind of nozzle, throat or vena contracta. 
The theoretical analysis applies the continuity and Bernoulli equations to an ideal fluid flow between 
points 1 and 2 thus:-

The theoretical volume flow rate is	
Q = A2 V2
And the theoretical mass flow rate is m.  = ρ A2 V2
The above values are theoretical because ideal fluid flow conditions were assumed. Actual flow rate 
values are obtained by multiplying the theoretical values by a meter discharge coefficient Cd to account 
for frictional and obstruction losses encountered by the fluid in its passage through the meter. The 
energy losses manifest themselves as a greater pressure drop (P1 – P2) then that predicted by the theory.
It can be shown that

The Venturi meter
The Venturi meter has a converging section from the initial pipe diameter down to a throat, followed 
by a diverging section back to the original pipe diameter. See figure.
Figure 2.2 the Venturi tube
Differential pressure measurements are taken between the inlet (1) and throat (2) positions. The geometry 
of the meter is designed to minimize energy losses (Cd > 0.95).

The Orifice meter
An orifice meter is a flat plate, with a hole which may be square edged or bevelled, inserted between 
two flanges in a pipe line. In this instance positions (1) and (2) are as shown below. Orifice plates have 
a simple construction and are therefore inexpensive but they suffer from high energy losses (Cd = 0.6).
Figure 2.3 the Orifice meter
(c)	
The Pitot-static tube
A slender concentric tube arrangement, aligned with the flow, used to measure flow velocity by means 
of a pressure difference. See figure below. The outer tube is closed in the flow direction but has sidewall 
holes to enable the measurement of static pressure. The inner tube is open in the direction of the fluid 
flow and is thus experiencing the total (static + dynamic) pressure of the fluid flow. It is assumed that 
the fluid velocity is rapidly brought to zero upon entry to the inner tube with negligible friction (Cd 
~1). The pressure difference between the tubes is applied to a U tube manometer which will therefore 
indicate the velocity pressure.

Flow Regimes
Consider the variation in velocity across the cross-section of a pipe containing a fluid in motion. There 
is no motion of fluid in direct contact with the pipe wall, and the velocity of the fluid stream increases 
in a direction away from the walls of the pipe. In 1839, Hagen (USA) observed that the fluid moves in 
layers with a velocity gradient. He observed that the velocity gradient in a circular pipe follows a parabolic 
law, at low flow rates. This type of flow is termed LAMINAR.
When the flow rate of the fluid stream is high, the velocity distribution had a much flatter shape and 
this type of flow is known as TURBULENT.
The average velocity producing turbulent flow is greater than that for a laminar flow of a given fluid in 
a given duct.

Internal Fluid Flow
For both flows, the build-up of velocity is along the radius of the pipe, and the maximum velocity occurs 
at the centre line.
Osborne Reynolds demonstrated experimentally in 1883 (Manchester) that under laminar flow, the fluid 
streamlines remain parallel. This was shown with the aid of a dye filament injected in the flow which 
remained intact at low flow velocities in the tube. As the flow velocity was increased (via a control valve), 
a point was reached at which the dye filament at first began to oscillate then broke up so that the colour 
was diffused over the whole cross-section indicating that particles of fluid no longer moved in an orderly 
manner but occupied different relative positions in successive cross-sections downstream.
Reynolds also found that it was not only the average pipe velocity V which determined whether the flow 
was laminar or turbulent, but that the density (ρ) and viscosity (µ) of the fluid and the pipe diameter 
(D), also determined the flow regime. He proposed that the criterion which determined the type of 
regime was the dimensionless group (ρvD/µ). This group has been named the Reynolds number (Re) 
as a tribute to his contribution to Fluid Mechanics.
Re = ρ V D/µ
(2.7)
Based on Reynolds number the flow can be distinguished into three regimes for pipe flow:
Laminar if Re < 2000
Transitional if 2000 < Re < 4000
Turbulent if Re > 4000
Re = 2000, 4000 are the lower and upper critical values.

Darcy Formula 
Consider a duct of length L, cross-sectional area Ac, surface area As, in which a fluid of density, is flowing 
at mean velocity V.
The forces acting on a segment of the duct are that due to pressure difference and that due to friction 
at the walls in contact with the fluid.
If the acceleration of the fluid is zero, the net forces acting on the element must be zero, hence

Internal Fluid Flow
According to Newton’s Second Law of Motion for a constant velocity flow:
∑ F = 0
The force due to pressure on either side of the section is equal to the friction force resisting the flow:
(P1 -P2). Ac – (f ρ V2/2). As = 0
Where the pressures act normal to the flow direction on the area of cross-section Ac, and the frictional 
force acts on the circumferential wall area As, separating the fluid and the pipe’s surface.
Let hf denote the head lost (m) due to friction over a duct length L,
ie	
p1 – p2 = ρ g hf
Substituting we get
hf = f. (As/Ac). V2/2g
For a pipe As/Ac = π D L /π D2/4 = 4L/D
hf = (4 fL/D).V2/2g
(2.8)
This is known as Darcy formula.
2.7	
The Friction factor and Moody diagram
The value of the friction factor (f) depends mainly on two parameters namely the value of the Reynolds 
number and the surface roughness.
For laminar flow (ie Re < 2000), the value of the friction factor is given by the following equation 
irrespective of the nature of the surface:
f = 
16
Re

(2.9)
While for a smooth pipe with turbulent (i.e. Re > 4000) flow, the friction factor is given by:
f = 0.079 Re    0.25        (Blasius equation)

Internal Fluid Flow
For Re > 2000 and Re < 4000, this region is known as the critical zone and the value of the friction factor 
is uncertain and not quoted on the Moody diagram (Figure 2.5).
In the turbulent zone, if the surface of the pipe is not perfectly smooth, then the value of the friction 
factor has to be determined from the Moody diagram.
The relative roughness (k/d) is the ratio of the average height of the surface projections on the inside 
of the pipe (k) to the pipe diameter (D). In common with Reynolds number and friction factor this 
parameter is dimensionless. Values of k are tabled on the Moody chart for a sample of materials.

Fluid Power
The fluid power available at a given point for a fluid is defined as the product of mass, acceleration due 
to gravity and the fluid head, and since the mass flow rate is defined as the volume flow rate multiplied 
by the fluid density, the Fluid power therefore can be expressed as:

Internal Fluid Flow
For a pump, htot represents the head required to overcome pipe friction (hf), obstruction losses (ho) and 
to raise the fluid to any elevation required (hz).
ie htot = hz + hf + ho
(2.13a)
Note: If the delivery tank operates at pressure in excess of the supply tank an additional term (hp) must 
be added to the required head equation as this pressure rise must also be supplied by the pump.
If the pump efficiency ηp is introduced, the actual pump head requirement is:
P = ρ. g. Q.htot / ηp
(2.12b)
For a turbine with efficiency ηt, the power output is given by:
P = ρ. g. Q.htot xηt

Where htot = hz – (hf + ho)

50 l/s of water (ρ = 1000 kg/m3, µ = 0.001 kg/ms) from tank1 to tank 2 as shown below if the pipeline 
length is 200m long, of 150 mm diameter galvanised steel (assumed surface roughness k=0.15mm).

Fluid Momentum
Knowledge of the forces exerted by moving fluids is important in the design of hydraulic machines and 
other constructions. The Continuity and Bernoulli relationships are not sufficient to solve forces acting on 
bodies in this case and the momentum principle derived from Newton’s Laws of motion is also required.
Momentum is defined as the product of mass and velocity, and represents the energy of motion stored 
in the system. Momentum is a vector quantity and can only be defined by specifying its direction as 
well as magnitude.
Newton’s Second Law of Motion
“The rate of change of momentum is proportional to the net force 
acting, and takes place in the direction of that force”.

Flow forces on a Reducer Bend
The change of momentum of a fluid flowing through a pipe bend induces a force on the pipe.
The pressures are to be considered in this case since the reducer bend is part of flowing system which 
is not subjected to atmospheric conditions.
x – Momentum
-Fx + p1A1 – p2 A2 cos θ = ρ V.  (V2 cos θ -V1)
y – Momentum

External Fluid Flow
3	 External Fluid Flow
3.1	
Regimes of External Flow
Consider the external flow of real fluids. The potential flow and boundary layer theory makes it possible 
to treat an external flow problem as consisting broadly of two distinct regimes, that immediately adjacent 
to the body’s surface, where viscosity is predominant and where frictional forces are generated, and 
that outside the boundary layer, where viscosity is neglected but velocities and pressure are affected by 
the physical presence of the body together with its associated boundary layer. In addition there is the 
stagnation point at the frontal of the body and there is the flow region behind the body (known as the 
wake). The wake starts from the point at which the boundary layer separation occurs. Separation occurs 
due to adverse pressure gradient, which combined with the viscous forces on the surface produces flow 
reversal, thus causes the stream to detach itself from the surface. The same situation exists at the rear 
edge of a body as it represents a physical discontinuity of the solid surface. 
The flow in the wake is thus highly turbulent and consist of large scale eddies. High rate energy 
description takes place there, with the result that the pressure in the wake is reduced.
A situation is created whereby the pressure acting on the body (stagnation pressure) is in excess of that 
acting on the rear of the body so that resultant force acting on the body in the direction of relative fluid 
motion exerts. The force acting on the body due to the pressure difference is called pressure drag.

External Fluid Flow
A stream lined body is defined as that body whose surface coincides with the stream lines, when the body 
is placed in a flow. In that case the separation of flow will take place only at the trailing edge (or rearmost 
part of the body). Though the boundary layer will start at the leading edge, will become turbulent from 
laminar, yet it does not separate up to the rearmost part of the body in case of stream-lined body. Bluff 
body is defined as that body whose surface does not coincide with the streamlines, when placed in a 
flow, then the flow is separated from the surface of the body much ahead of its trailing edge with the 
result of a very large wake formation zone. Then the drag due to pressure will be very large as compared 
to the drag due to friction on the body. Thus, the bodies of such a shape in which the pressure drag is 
very large as compared to friction drag are called bluff bodies.

Drag Coefficient
Any object moving through a fluid experiences drag – the net force in the direction of flow due to 
pressure and shear stress forces on the surface of the object.

Where
Fd = drag force (N)
Cd = drag coefficient
ρ = density of fluid
V = flow velocity
A = characteristic frontal area of the body, normal to the flow direction.
The drag coefficient is a function of several parameters such as the shape of the body, its frontal area, 
velocity of flow or Reynolds Number, and Roughness of the Surface.
Objects drag coefficients are mostly results of experiments. Drag coefficients for some common bodies 
are listed in Table 3.2.

The Boundary Layer
Boundary layers appear on the surface of bodies in viscous flow because the fluid seems to “stick” to the 
surface. Right at the surface the flow has zero relative speed and this fluid transfers momentum to adjacent 
layers through the action of viscosity. Thus a thin layer of fluid with lower velocity than the outer flow 
develops. The requirement that the flow at the surface has no relative motion is the “no slip condition.”

Figure 3.3: Development of the boundary layer on a flat plate
The boundary layer thickness, δ, is defined as the distance required for the flow to nearly reach Uoo. 
We might take an arbitrary number (say 99%) to define what we mean by “nearly”, but certain other 
definitions are used most frequently.
The concept of a boundary layer was introduced and formulated by Prandtl for steady, two-dimensional 
laminar flow past a flat plate using the Navier-Stokes equations. Prandtl’ s student, Blasius, was able to 
solve these equations analytically for large Reynolds number flows. The details of the derivation are 
omitted for simplicity, and the results are summarized here.
Boundary layers may be either laminar (layered), or turbulent (disordered) depending on the value of 
the Reynolds number. For lower Reynolds numbers, the boundary layer is laminar and the streamwise 
velocity changes uniformly as one move away from the wall, as shown on the left side of the figure. For 
higher Reynolds numbers, the boundary layer is turbulent and the streamwise velocity is characterized 
by unsteady (changing with time) swirling flows inside the boundary layer. The external flow reacts to 
the edge of the boundary layer just as it would to the physical surface of an object. So the boundary 
layer gives any object an “effective” shape which is usually slightly different from the physical shape. To 
make things more confusing, the boundary layer may lift off or “separate” from the body and create an 
effective shape much different from the physical shape. This happens because the flow in the boundary 
has very low energy (relative to the free stream) and is more easily driven by changes in pressure. Flow 
separation is the reason for wing stall at high angle of attack. The effects of the boundary layer on lift 
are contained in the lift coefficient and the effects on drag are contained in the drag coefficient.

Since the system is stable, Newton’s second law of motion applies:
Weight = Drag force + Upthrust (Buoyancy)
Volume of sphere	
= (4.pi/3) x R3 = 0.000524m3
Area normal to the flow	
= (pi) x R2 = 0.007854 m2
The Upthrust is FB	
= ρfluid x VL x g = 5.136 N
Weight Fg	
= ρsphere x VL x g = 30.819 N
Hence	 Drag force FD = Fg – FB
 = 30.819 – 5.136 = 25.683 N

Worked example 3.4
A racing car shown below is fitted with an inverted aerofoil of length 1.2m and chord 0.85m at such 
angle that Cd=0.3 and Cl=1.3.
The car length is 4.6m, the body surface area is 11.5 m2 and the skin friction coefficient is given by 0.0741 
ReL
-0.2 where Re is based on car length. The car weight is 12.75 kN and the rolling resistance is 40N per 
kN of normal force between the tyres and road surface. Assuming that the form drag on the car is 500 N 
when the car maintains a constant speed of 60 m/s, determine at this speed:
1.	 The total aerodynamic drag force on the car
2.	 The total rolling resistance, and
3.	 The power required to drive the car.
Assume for air assume: Density = 1.2 kg/m3, and the dynamic viscosity = 1.8x10-5 kg/ms.
Solution:
1.	 let FD1 be the aerofoil drag force, FD2 the car body drag force and FD3 the form drag force.

Compressible flow definitions
Compressible flow describes the behaviour of fluids that experience significant variations in density 
under the application of external pressures. For flows in which the density does not vary significantly, the 
analysis of the behaviour of such flows may be simplified greatly by assuming a constant density and the 
fluid is termed incompressible. This is an idealisation, which leads to the theory of incompressible flow. 
However, in the many cases dealing with gases (especially at higher velocities) and those cases dealing 
with liquids with large pressure changes, significant variations in density can occur, and the flow should 
be analysed as a compressible flow if accurate results are to be obtained.
Allowing for a change in density brings an additional variable into the analysis. In contrast to incompressible 
flows, which can usually be solved by considering only conservation of mass and conservation of 
momentum. Usually, the principle of conservation of energy is included. However, this introduces another 
variable (temperature), and so a fourth equation (such as the ideal gas equation) is required to relate the 
temperature to the other thermodynamic properties in order to fully describe the flow.
Fundamental assumptions 
1.	 The gas is continuous. 
2.	 The gas is perfect (obeys the perfect gas law) 
3.	 Gravitational effects on the flow field are negligible. 
4.	 Magnetic and electrical effects are negligible. 
5.	 The effects of viscosity are negligible.

mass between the sides of the piston at section 2 implies:
 ρ.A.a = (ρ+δρ).A.(a+da)
Since “A” is area of cross-section of the piston (constant); “ρ” is the density of the fluid and “a” is the 
speed of sound wave propagated through the fluid.
Expand the above to get 
(ρ.da + a.dρ) = 0
(4.1)
Applying the Momentum Equation to the same section:
P.A – (P + dP).A = ρ.A.a (a+da-a )
Hence dP = – ρ.a.da
but ρda = – a.dρ
ie dP = – a.(- a.dρ)
Hence

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

The Mach number
Mach number is the ratio of the velocity of a fluid to the velocity of sound in that fluid, named after Ernst 
Mach (1838–1916), an Austrian physicist and philosopher. In the case of an object moving through a 
fluid, such as an aircraft in flight, the Mach number is equal to the velocity of the airplane relative to the 
air divided by the velocity of sound in air at that altitude. Mach numbers less than one indicate subsonic 
flow; those greater than one, supersonic flow. The Mach number can be expressed as
M = V / a

Compressible Fluid Dynamics
Where 
M = Mach number
V = fluid flow velocity (m/s)
a = speed of sound (m/s)
Alternatively the Mach number can be expressed with the density and the bulk modulus for elasticity as 
M = V (ρ /Ks)1/2
(4.6)
Where 
ρ = density of fluid (kg/m3)
Ks = bulk modulus elasticity (N/m2 (Pa))
The bulk modulus elasticity has the dimension pressure and is commonly used to characterize the fluid 
compressibility.
The square of the Mach number is the Cauchy Number. (C)
M2 = C
(4.7)
As the aircraft moves through the air it makes pressure waves. These pressure waves stream out away 
from the aircraft at the speed of sound. This wave acts just like the ripples through water after a stone is 
dropped in the middle of a still pond. At Mach 1 or during transonic speed (Mach 0.7–0.9), the aircraft 
actually catches up with its own pressure waves. These pressure waves turn into one big shock wave. It 
is this shock wave that buffets the airplane. The shock wave also creates high drag on the airplane and 
slows the airplane’s speed. As the airplane passes through the shock wave it is moving faster than the 
sound it makes. The shock wave forms an invisible cone of sound that stretches out toward the ground. 
When the shock wave hits the ground it causes a sonic boom that sounds like a loud thunderclap. 
The energy lost in the process of compressing the airflow through these shock waves is called wave drag. 
This reduces lift on the airplane.

Mach number and flow regimes:
Mach number represents the ratio of the speed of an object such as aeroplane in air, or the relative 
motion of air against the aeroplane. It is commonly agreed that for Mach numbers less than 0.3, the 
fluid is considered incompressible. The following zoning based on the value of Mach numbers are 
universally agreed.

Figure 4.5 One dimensional compressible flow
Q – W = m [(h2 – h1) + (V2
2 – V1
2)/2 +g(z2 – z1)]
If the flow is adiabatic, and there is no shaft work and assume horizontal duct, the equation reduces to
(h2 – h1) + (V2
2 – V1
2)/2 =0
(4.12)
Or in general	
h + V2/2 = constant
By differentiation	
	
dh + v dv = 0
But the first law of thermodynamics states that
dQ – dW = du
The second law of thermodynamics states that	 dQ = T.dS
Also	
dW = P. d(1/ρ)
and 	
h = u + P/ρ	
or 	
du = dh – P. d(1/ρ)+ (1/ρ).dP
Hence the 1st law of thermodynamics is written as
T.dS = dh – P. d(1/ρ) – (1/ρ).dP + P. d(1/ρ)
T.dS = dh – dP/ρ
For isentropic process, dS = 0
Then	
dh = dP/ρ

but dh = – v.dv
hence	 -v. dv = dP/ρ
Therefore

Stagnation properties of compressible flow
Stagnation condition refers to the situation or rather position in which the fluid becomes motionless. 
There are many examples of this in real applications; two are shown in figure 4.7
Figure 4.7 Stagnation situations in flow applications
When defining what is meant by a compressible flow, it is useful to compare the density to a reference 
value, such as the stagnation density, ρ0, which is the density of the fluid if it were to be slowed down 
isentropically to stationary.

Hydroelectric Power
5	 Hydroelectric Power
Archimedes was a mathematician and inventor from ancient Greece (born 280 BC). He invented a 
screw-shaped machine or hydraulic screw that raised water from a lower to a higher level.
5.1	
Introduction
Hydraulic Turbines are used for converting the potential energy of water into useful Mechanical power 
to drive machines as in Mills or pumps or electrical energy using electrical generators.
•	 Hydroelectric power stations can be classified according to power output into micro hydro, 
mini hydro, small hydro and large hydro systems. The definitions according to the International 
Energy Association are as folloMicro hydro – hydroelectric station with installed capacity 
lower than 100 kW
•	 Mini hydro – hydroelectric station in the range of 100kW to 1 MW
•	 Small hydro – hydroelectric station in the range of 1 MW to 30 MW 
•	 Large hydro – hydroelectric station with installed capacity of over 30 MW
Hydropower is a clean and renewable source of energy that can contribute to fighting climate change. 
The following advantages make hydropower a much preferred option to any fossil fuel power scheme:
•	 No fuel needed – The chief advantage of hydro systems is elimination of the cost of fuel. 
Hydroelectric plants are immune to price increases for fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas or 
coal, and do not require imported fuel.
•	 Longevity – Hydroelectric plants tend to have longer lives than fuel-fired generation, with some 
plants now in service having been built 50 to 100 years ago.
•	 Pollution free – Hydroelectric plants generally have small to negligible emissions of carbon 
dioxide and methane due to reservoir emissions, and emit no sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, 
dust, or other pollutants associated with combustion.

Hydroelectric Power
•	 Quick Response – Since the generating units can be started and stopped quickly, they can 
follow system loads efficiently, and may be able to reshape water flows to more closely match 
daily and seasonal system energy demands.
•	 Environmentally friendly – Reservoirs created by hydroelectric schemes often provide excellent 
leisure facilities for water sports, and become tourist attractions in themselves..
•	 Wildlife preserves can be created around reservoirs, which can provide stable habitats for 
endangered and threatened species(Eg. catch rates for game fish like walleye and small mouth 
bass are substantially higher on hydro power reservoirs than natural lakes.) 
•	 Flood prevention – the surplus water can be stored behind the dam and hence reduce the risk 
of flood.
5.2	
Types of hydraulic turbines
Depending on the method of interaction between the fluid and the machine, there are two main types 
of turbines, IMPULSE and REACTION.
A	
Impulse Turbine
This type of turbine is usually selected for high head and low flow rate conditions. The water is 
usually directed on to the turbine blades via a nozzle and the jet will impinge and leaves the turbine at 
atmospheric condition.
The high velocity jet leaves the nozzle at atmospheric pressure and impinges on to the wheel blades 
or buckets.
The tangential force exerted on the buckets is produced by a change in momentum of the jet, both in 
magnitude and direction.
The most important type of impulse turbine is the PELTON wheel.

Hydroelectric Power
B	
Reaction Turbine
This type of turbine is usually selected for low head conditions, but relatively higher flow rate than in 
impulse turbines. In reaction turbines part of the pressure energy is transformed into kinetic energy in 
the stationary guide vanes and the remainder is transferred in the runner wheel. This type of turbine does 
not run at atmospheric; in fact the pressure changes continuously while flowing through the machine. 
The chief turbines of this type are the FRANCIS and KAPLAN turbines.

Reversible Pump/Turbine
Modern pumped storage units require the use of a reversible pump / turbine that can be run in one 
direction as pump and in the other direction as turbine. These are coupled to reversible electric motor/
generator. The motor drives the pump during the storage portion of the cycle, while the generator 
produces electricity during discharge from the upper reservoir. 
Most reversible-pump turbines are of the Francis type. The complexity of the unit, however, increases 
significantly as compared to a turbine alone. In spite of the higher costs for both hydraulic and electrical 
controls and support equipment, the total installed cost will be less than for completely separate pump-
motor and turbine-generator assemblies with dual water passages.

Performance evaluation of Hydraulic Turbines
The power available from water can be expressed as
P = ρ Q g h x η
(5.1)
Where 
P = power available (W)
ρ = density (kg/m3) (~ 1000 kg/m3 for water)
Q= water flow (m3/s)
g = acceleration of gravity (9.81 m/s2)
h = falling height, head (m)
The hydraulic efficiency depends on many factors such as the type of turbine and the operational 
conditions. Typical values are between 50% and 75%.

The theoretical approach velocity of water is given by:

(5.2)
However real hydropower stations have penstock of considerable length incorporating many pipe fittings, 
bends and valves, hence the effective head is reduced, and as such the real velocity of water approaching 
the turbine is less than that quoted in equation 5.2. 
The volume flow rate of water is calculated by the continuity equation:
 Q = V x A

Pumped storage hydroelectricity 
Some areas of the world have used geographic features to store large quantities of water in elevated 
reservoirs, using excess electricity at times of low demand to pump water up to the reservoirs, then 
letting the water fall through turbine generators to retrieve the energy when demand peaks.
Pumped storage hydroelectricity was first used in Italy and Switzerland in the 1890s. By 1933 reversible 
pump-turbines with motor-generators were available. Adjustable speed machines are now being used 
to improve efficiency. 
Hydro-electric power plants are economically viable because of the difference between peak and off-peak 
electricity prices. Pumped-storage plants can respond to load changes within seconds.
Hydropower electricity is the product of transforming the potential energy stored in water in an elevated 
reservoir into the kinetic energy of the running water, then mechanical energy in a rotating turbine, and 
finally electrical energy in an alternator or generator. Hydropower is a mature renewable power generation 
technology that offers two very desirable characteristics in today’s electricity systems: built-in storage 
that increases the system’s flexibility and fast response time to meet rapid or unexpected fluctuations in 
supply or demand. Hydropower amounted to 65% of the electricity generated from renewable energy 
sources in Europe in 2007 or 9% of the total electricity production in the EU-27. Today’s installed capacity 
in the EU-27 for hydropower is about 102 GW, without hydro-pumped storage. Approximately 90% of 
this potential is covered by large hydropower plants. Over 21 000 small hydropower plants account for 
above 12 GW of installed capacity in the EU-27.

Case study – Dinorwig power station
Dinorwig is the largest scheme of its kind in Europe. The station’s six powerful generating units (6x288 = 
1728 MW) stand in Europe’s largest man-made cavern. Adjacent to this lies the main inlet valve chamber 
housing the plant that regulates the flow of water through the turbines. 
Dinorwig’s reversible pump/turbines are capable of reaching maximum generation in less than 16 seconds. 
Using off-peak electricity the six units are reversed as pumps to transport water from the lower reservoir 
Llyn Peris, back to Marchlyn Mawr.

Worked Example 5.2
The average head of the water stored in the upper reservoir of the Dinorwig pumped storage system in 
Wales is 500 metres.
a)	 Calculate the water flow rate through one of the turbo-generators when it is producing an 
output of 300 MW at 94% efficiency.
b)	 The upper reservoir can store 7.2 million cubic metres of water. Show that this is enough 
to maintain the output from all six 300 MW generators, running simultaneously, for a little 
over five hours.
You may assume that there is no rain during these hours.
Solution
a)	 The output power in kilowatts is given by
P = 9.81 Q H η
So in this case we have 300,000 = 9.81 x Q x 500 x 0.94
Which means that Q = 65 m3 s-1
b)	 The flow rate for 6 turbines is 6 x 65 = 390 m3 s-1 
And the available supply will maintain this for 
7,200,000/390 = 18,442 seconds, 
Which is 18442/3600 = 5.12 hours.
