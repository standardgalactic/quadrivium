About the Author
C. C. Edwards has a Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Wisconsin,
Milwaukee, and is currently teaching mathematics on the undergraduate and
graduate levels. She has been using technology in the classroom since before
Texas Instruments came out with its first graphing calculator, and she fre-
quently gives workshops at national and international conferences on using
technology in the classroom. She is the author of TI-83 Plus Graphing Calculator
for Dummies and TI-84 Plus Graphing Calculator for Dummies and she has writ-
ten 40 activities for the Texas Instruments Explorations Web site. She was an
editor of Eightysomething!, a newsletter that used to be published by Texas
Instruments. She still hasn’t forgiven TI for canceling that newsletter.
Just barely five feet tall, CC, as her friends call her, has three goals in life:
to be six inches taller, to have naturally curly hair, and to be independently
wealthy. As yet, she is nowhere close to meeting any of these goals. When
she retires, she plans to become an old-lady carpenter.


Dedication
This book is dedicated to Julia Hamp Edwards, my grandmother. She was a
very wise and loving person who saw to it that I got to go to college.
Author’s Acknowledgments
I’d like to thank the folks at John Wiley & Sons who worked behind the
scenes on the creation of this book. I don’t come in contact with many of
these people until the book is in the editing stage, which takes place after
I write the acknowledgments. But from past experience I know that they
do an extremely good job. Unfortunately, I can’t tell you about it at this
time. Their names appear in the Publisher’s Acknowledgments.
The Wiley people I’ve been dealing with so far are the same people I worked
with on the TI-83 Plus Graphing Calculator For Dummies and TI-84 Plus
Graphing Calculator For Dummies books: Melody Layne, acquisitions editor,
and Christopher Morris, project editor. As usual, Melody has given me
many superb ideas for the book and has been a great liaison with Texas
Instruments. And Chris, as before, has given me extremely good criticism.
It’s hard to disagree with Chris because he’s usually right on target.
On the home front, I thank all my academic colleagues and students who
inspire me. To name names, they are Ioana Mihaila, Bogdan Mihaila, Olcay
Akman, Fusun Akman, Menassie Ephrem, Tom Hoffman, Karen Thompson,
Caroline Lowery, Cassandra Lim, and many, many others. I also thank Ginny
Levson, who provided me with the musical background that kept me sane
while writing this book — it was a CD, in case you’re wondering. And, as
corny as it sounds, I thank my border collies, Nip and Tess, for putting up
with fewer walks and less play time.

Introduction
D
o you know how to use the TI-89, TI-89 Titanium, TI-92 Plus, or Voyage 200
graphing calculator to do each of the following?
 Solve equations and systems of equations
 Factor polynomials
 Evaluate derivatives and integrals
 Graph functions, parametric equations, polar equations, and sequences
 Create Stat Plots and analyze statistical data
 Multiply matrices
 Solve differential equations and systems of differential equations
 Transfer files between two or more calculators
 Save calculator files on your computer
 Add applications to your calculator so it can do even more than it could
when you bought it
If not, this is the book for you. Contained within these pages are straight-
forward, easy-to-follow directions that tell you how to do everything listed
here — and much, much more.
About This Book
Although this book doesn’t tell you how to do everything the calculator is
capable of doing, it gets pretty close. It covers more than just the basics of
using the calculator, paying special attention to warning you of the problems
you could encounter if you knew only the basics of using the calculator.
This is a reference book. It’s process-driven, not application-driven. I don’t
give you a problem to solve and then tell you how to use the calculator to
solve that particular problem. Instead, I give you the steps you need to get
the calculator to perform a particular task, such as constructing a histogram.

Using This Book with a TI-92 Plus or
a Voyage 200 
Although this book isn’t expressly written for the TI-92 Plus and Voyage 200,
it does tell you how to use these calculators, but you must keep in mind three
minor differences between these calculators and the TI-89: 
 The TI-92 Plus and Voyage 200 have QWERTY keyboards, the TI-89
doesn’t. So when I give directions telling you to press É to enter
a letter on the TI-89, on a TI-92 Plus or Voyage 200 you’d simply press
the letter on the QWERTY keyboard.
 There are some symbols on the TI-89 keypad that are located in different
places on the TI-92 Plus and Voyage 200 keypads. But this is no big deal 
the Cheat Sheet that comes with this book lists these symbols and their
locations on the TI-92 Plus and Voyage 200. Just refer to the Cheat Sheet
when, for example, I tell you to press ¥Z to enter θ and you notice that θ
isn’t above the Z key on the TI-92 Plus and Voyage 200.
 The TI-89 has only five Function keys on the keypad just below the cal-
culator’s screen, ƒ through ‡; the TI-92 and Voyage 200 have eight
Function keys on the keypad below this screen. On the TI-89 you, for
example, access function F6 by pressing 2ƒ, on the TI-92 and Voyage
200 you access this function by pressing the F6 key. So in this book when
you see directions telling you to press 2ƒ, 2„, or 2… you should
respectively press the F6, F7, or F8 key on a TI-92 or Voyage 200 calculator.
Conventions Used in This Book
When I refer to “the calculator,” I am referring to the TI-89 and the TI-89
Titanium. With three minor differences, the instructions I give for “the calcu-
lator” can also be used on a TI-92 or Voyage 200. I explain these differences
in the preceding section.
When I want you to press a key on the calculator, I use an icon for that key.
For example, if I want you to press the ENTER key, I say “Press ¸.” If I
want you to press a series of keys, such as the MODE key and then the Right
Arrow key, I say, “Press 3B.” You press all keys on the calculator one at a
time. On the calculator, there is no such thing as holding down one key while
you press another key.

Becoming handy with the location of the keys on the calculator is tricky
enough, but remembering the locations of the secondary functions (the color-
coded functions above most keys) is even more of a challenge. So when I want
you to access one of those functions, I give you the actual keystrokes. For
example, if I want you to access the MATH menu, I tell you to press 2z. This
is a simpler method than that of the manual that came with your calculator 
it would say, “Press 2I,” and then make you hunt for the location of the
secondary function MATH. The same principle holds for using key combina-
tions to enter specific characters; for example, I tell you to press Éµ to
enter the less-than symbol.
When I want you to use the Arrow keys, but not in any specific order, I say,
“Press ABCD.” If I want you to use only the Up and Down Arrow keys,
I say, “Press CD.”
What You Don’t Have to Read
Of course, you don’t have to read anything you don’t want to. The only items
in this book that you really don’t need to read are the items next to Technical
Stuff icons. These items are designed for the curious reader who wants to
know, but doesn’t really need to know, why something happens.
Other items that you might not need to read are the paragraphs that follow
the steps in a procedure. These paragraphs give you extra help in case you
need it. The steps themselves are in bold; the explanatory paragraphs are in
a normal font.
Foolish Assumptions
My nonfoolish assumption is that you know (in effect) nothing about using
the calculator, or you wouldn’t be reading this book. My foolish assumptions
are as follows:
 You own, or have access to, a TI-89, TI-89 Titanium, TI-92 Plus, or
Voyage 200 calculator.
 If you want to transfer files from your calculator to your computer,
I assume that you have a computer and know the basics of how to
operate it.

Introduction

How This Book Is Organized
The parts of this book are organized by tasks that you would like to have
the calculator perform.
Part I: Making Friends with the Calculator
This part describes the basics of using the calculator. It addresses such tasks
as adjusting the contrast and getting the calculator to perform basic arithmetic
operations.
Part II: Doing Algebra and Trigonometry
This part tells you how to solve equations, factor polynomials, find partial
fraction decompositions, and evaluate trigonometric functions. This part
also tells you how to deal with complex numbers and how to find complex
solutions to equations.
Part III: Graphing and
Analyzing Functions
In this part, think visual. Part III tells you how to graph and analyze functions
and how to create a table for the graph. This part also tells you how to find
critical points and inflection points.
Part IV: Working with Sequences,
Parametric Equations, and 
Polar Equations
This part describes how you can graph and analyze parametric equations,
polar equations, and sequences.
4
TI-89 Graphing Calculator For Dummies 

Part V: Doing Calculus
This part is loaded with information on how to do almost anything related to
calculus, vector calculus, and differential equations. It tells you how to evalu-
ate integrals, derivatives, limits, dot products, and cross products, and how
to graph in 3D. It also tells you how to solve differential equations and how to
graph slope fields. It even tells you how to find Taylor polynomials and how
to convert between rectangular, cylindrical, and spherical coordinates.
Part VI: Dealing with Matrices
Part VI gives you the basics on how to add, subtract, multiply, invert, and
transpose matrices. And then it delves deeper into the world of matrices by
telling you how to use matrices to solve systems of equations and how to find
eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
Part VII: Dealing with Probability and
Statistics
It’s highly probable that Part VII tells you how to deal with probability and
statistics. In particular, my statistics show that it tells you how to generate
random numbers, evaluate permutations and combinations, analyze one- and
two-variable data, and find a regression equation that models your data.
Part VIII: Communicating with PCs and
Other Calculators
Your calculator joins the information superhighway. Part VIII describes how
you can save calculator files on a computer and how you can transfer files
from one calculator to another.
Part IX: The Part of Tens
Part IX contains a plethora of wonderful information. This part tells you
about the many wonderful applications you can put on your calculator, and
it describes the most common errors and error messages that you might
encounter.

Introduction

Icons Used in This Book
This book uses four icons to help you along the way. Here’s what they are
and what they mean:
The text next to this icon tells you about shortcuts and other ways of enhanc-
ing your use of the calculator.
The text next to this icon tells you something you should remember so you
don’t run into problems later. Usually it’s a reminder to enter the appropriate
type of number so you can avoid an error message.
There is no such thing as crashing the calculator. But this icon warns you of
those few times when you can do something wrong on the calculator and be
totally baffled because the calculator gives you confusing feedback 
either
no error message or a cryptic error message that doesn’t tell you the true
location of the problem. 
This is the stuff you don’t need to read unless you’re really curious.
Where to Go from Here
You don’t have to read this book from cover to cover. You don’t even have
to start reading at the beginning of a chapter. When you want to know how to
get the calculator to do something, just start reading at the beginning of the
appropriate section. The index and table of contents should help you find
whatever you’re looking for.
Custom menus for the TI-89 calculator are available at the Wiley Web site at

with the
Calculator

In this part . . .
T
his part takes you once around the block with the
basics of using the calculator. In addition to showing
you how to use the calculator to evaluate arithmetic expres-
sions, I discuss the elementary calculator functions —
including multi-use keys, menus, modes, and the CATALOG.
I also cover the fundamentals of using and combining
expressions, including the order of operations and storing
and recalling variables. In addition, I explain how to use the
numerous functions housed in the MATH Number menu to
perform tricks such as finding quotients and remainders
when doing long division.

I-89 graphing calculators are loaded with many useful features. With
them, you can graph and investigate functions, parametric equations,
polar equations, and sequences. You can also produce 3D graphs, contour
maps, slope fields, and direction fields. These calculators can even factor
expressions and solve systems of equations. And if that’s not enough to keep
you busy, a TI-89 can integrate, differentiate, evaluate limits, solve differential
equations, analyze statistical data, and manipulate matrices. You can even
turn this calculator into an e-book reader!
But if you’ve never used a graphing calculator before, you might at first find it
a bit intimidating. After all, it contains several dozen menus, some of which
contain three or four submenus. But getting used to working with the calcula-
tor really isn’t hard. After you get familiar with what the calculator is capable
of doing, finding the menu that houses the command you need is quite easy.
And you have this book to help you along the way.
When to Change the Batteries
The convenience of battery power has a traditional downside: What if the
batteries run out of juice at a crucial moment, such as during a final exam?
Fortunately, the calculator gives you some leeway. When your batteries are
low, you see the BATT warning message displayed to the right of the last line
of the screen. After you see this message for the first time, the calculator
should, according to the manufacturer, continue to function just fine for at
least one week. When the batteries are so low that you might not make it

through that final exam, the calculator highlights the BATT warning message,
as illustrated in the second picture in Figure 1-1. One exception exists: If you
attempt to transfer data or an application from a PC or another calculator to
a calculator that has low batteries, the calculator with the low batteries dis-
plays a warning message telling you to change the batteries and refuses to
make the transfer. (Part VIII explains how to transfer data and applications.)
Because you’ve likely put batteries into countless toys, you should have no
trouble opening the cover on the back of the calculator and popping in four
AAA batteries. Above the AAA battery chamber is a panel that opens to the
compartment containing the backup battery. The lid of the panel indicates the
type of battery housed in the compartment. The manufacturer recommends
that you replace this battery every three or four years. So mark your calendar!
Turning the Calculator On and Off
Press ´ to turn the calculator on. (The ´ key is the last key in the left
column of keys on the keyboard.) The first time you turn on the TI-89 Titanium,
you see the application screen, as shown in the first picture in Figure 1-1. On
the TI-89, you see the Home screen, as in the second picture in this figure.
To turn the calculator off, press 2 and then press ´. (The 2 key is the
second key from the top in the left column of keys.) Pressing 2´ to turn
off the calculator also exits any application you were using (such as the
Graph application) so that when you turn the calculator back on, you’re con-
fronted with the Application screen on the TI-89 Titanium or the Home screen
on the TI-89.
If you want to turn the calculator off without exiting your current application,
press ¥ and then press ´. (The ¥ key is the third key from the top in the
left column of keys.) The next time you turn the calculator on, it will be exactly
as you left it.

Part I: Making Friends with the Calculator 

To prolong the life of the batteries, the calculator automatically turns itself
off after several minutes of inactivity. But don’t worry — when you press ´,
all your work appears on the calculator just as you left it before the calculator
turned itself off.
In some types of light, the screen can be hard to see. To increase the contrast,
press and hold ¥ and repeatedly press « until you have the desired con-
trast. To decrease the contrast, press and hold ¥ and repeatedly press |.
What Is the Home Screen?
The Home screen is the screen where most of the action takes place as you
use the calculator — it’s where you evaluate expressions and execute com-
mands. This is also the screen you usually return to after you’ve completed a
task such as entering a matrix in the Data/Matrix editor or graphing a function.
Press " to go to the Home screen from any other screen. If you want to
clear the contents of the Home screen, press ƒn.
The second picture in Figure 1-1 (shown previously) displays the Home
screen layout. The first line is the Toolbar, which houses all the neat com-
mands you can use. Under that is the large space, called the history area,
where the calculator displays the results of whatever it is you told the calcu-
lator to do. The second-to-last line is the command line — this is where you
enter the commands telling the calculator to do something. And the last line
is the status line, where the calculator tells you what it’s up to. For example,
the third entry (RAD) on this line in Figure 1-1 tells you that the calculator is
expecting all angles to be measured in radians.
Using the Keyboard
The row of keys under the calculator screen contains the function keys you
use to select the Toolbar menus at the top of the screen. The next three rows,
for the most part, contain editing keys, menu keys, and Arrow keys. The Arrow
keys (ABCD) control the movement of the cursor. The remaining rows con-
tain, among other things, the keys you typically find on a scientific calculator.
Using the 2 key
Above and to the left of most keys is a secondary key function written in the
same color as the 2 key. To access that function, first press 2 and then
press the key. For example, π is above the õ key, so to use π in an expres-
sion, press 2 and then press õ.
11
Chapter 1: Coping with the Basics

Because hunting for the entities written above the keys can be tedious, in this
book I use only the actual keystrokes. For example, I make statements like,
“Enter π into the calculator by pressing 2õ.” Most other books would
state, “π is entered into the calculator by pressing 2[π].”
When the 2 key is active and the calculator is waiting for you to press the
next key, you see 2nd displayed to the left on the last line of the screen.
Using the ¥ key
Above and to the right of most keys on the top half of the keyboard and the
last three keys in the right column is a secondary key function written in the
same color as the ¥ key. To access that function, first press ¥ and then
press the key. For example, θ is above the õ key, so to use θ in an expression,
press ¥ and then press õ.
Hunting for the entities written above the keys can be a pain, so for this book
I tell you only the actual keystrokes. For example, I make statements like,
“Enter θ into the calculator by pressing ¥õ.” Most other books would state,
“θ is entered into the calculator by pressing ¥[θ].”
When the ¥ key is active and the calculator is waiting for you to press the next
key, the calculator displays a diamond to the left on the last line of the screen.
Using the ¸ key
You use the ¸ key to evaluate expressions and to execute commands.
After you have, for example, entered an arithmetic expression (such as 5 + 4),
press ¸ to evaluate that expression. In this context, the ¸ key func-
tions as the equal sign. I explain entering arithmetic expressions in Chapter 2.
Using the Arrow keys
The Arrow keys (A, B, C, and D) control the movement of the cursor. These
keys are in a circular pattern in the upper-right corner of the keyboard. As
expected, B moves the cursor to the right, A moves it to the left, and so on.
When I want you to use the Arrow keys — but not in any specific order — I
refer to them all together, as in “Use ABCD to place the cursor on the
entry.” Or I simply write, “use the Arrow keys.”
12
Part I: Making Friends with the Calculator 

Using the É and ¤ keys to write text
You wouldn’t want to write a novel on the calculator, but you often need to
write text in order to give a name to things such as the variables you define
and the files you store in the calculator. You enter these names by using the
É and ¤ keys and the letters of the alphabet appearing above and to the
right of most keys on the bottom half of the keyboard. The letters x, y, z, and t
have their own keys: ÙÚÛÜ.
On the TI-89, the ALPHA key, j, is in lowercase letters.
To enter a single lowercase letter, first press É and then press the key
corresponding to that letter; for an uppercase letter, first press ¤ and then
press the key corresponding to the letter. For example, the letter G is above
the m key; to enter a lowercase g, press É and then press m; to enter an
uppercase G, press ¤ and then press m.
The calculator is not case sensitive. If, for example, you save a number with
the name “A” and then save another number with the name “a,” the calculator
overwrites the number stored in “A” with the number you are saving in “a.”
Because hunting for letters on the calculator can become annoying, I tell you
the exact keystrokes needed to create them. For example, if I want you to
enter the lowercase letter g, I say, “Press Ém to enter the letter g.” Most
other books would say “Press É[G]” and leave it up to you to figure out
where that letter is on the calculator.
You must press É before entering each letter. However, if you want to
enter many letters, first press 2É to lock the calculator in Alpha mode.
Then all you have to do is press the keys for the various letters. When you’re
finished, press É to take the calculator out of Alpha mode. For example,
to enter Exam into the calculator, press 2É¤eÙ|z and then press
É to tell the calculator that you’re no longer entering letters. To enter
more than one uppercase letter, press ¤É, enter the letters, and then
press É to take the calculator out of Alpha mode.
When the calculator is in Alpha mode and is waiting for you to enter a letter,
you see the letter a displayed to the left on the last line of the screen, as seen
in the second picture in Figure 1-1. When you press 2É to lock the cal-
culator in Alpha mode, the a at the bottom of the screen is highlighted. If the
calculator is waiting for you to enter an uppercase letter, you see displayed.
And when you press ¤É to enter several uppercase letters, ÿ appears at
the bottom of the screen.

Chapter 1: Coping with the Basics

Recalling and Editing Entries
Being able to edit a current or previous entry is a real timesaver. The first
picture in Figure 1-2 provides an example. The first entry in the history area
found the lcm (least common multiple) of 4, 6, and 14. If you now wanted to
find the lcm of 4, 6, and 35, wouldn’t it be a lot easier to edit this entry by
changing the 14 to a 35 than it would be to key in the whole entry from
scratch? This section tells you how to do this.
Recalling an entry to the command line
You can edit an entry only when it’s on the command line (the second line
from the bottom of the screen). For example, in the first picture in Figure 1-2,
the last entry evaluated is gcd(84, 35). Because this entry remains on the
command line, you can, for example, edit it to find gcd(84, 24) by simply
changing 35 to 24. (I explain editing later in this section.) The first line in this
picture found the lcm of 4, 6, and 14. If you want to edit this entry to find, for
example, the lcm of 4, 6, and 35, you would first recall the entry to the com-
mand line and then edit it. To recall an entry to the command line, repeatedly
press C to highlight the entry you want to place on the command line, as
illustrated in the second picture in Figure 1-2. Then press ¸ to place the
entry on the command line, as in the third picture in Figure 1-2.
14
Part I: Making Friends with the Calculator 
Keys to remember
The following keystrokes are invaluable:
 N: This is the equivalent of the Escape
key on a computer. It gets you out of what-
ever you’re doing. For example, when
you’re in a menu and decide you really don’t
want to be in that menu, press N to exit
the menu. Or if you have moved the cursor
into the history area and want to return to
the command line, press N.
 ¸: This key is used to execute com-
mands and to evaluate expressions. When
evaluating expressions, it’s the equivalent
of the equal sign.
 M: This is the erase key. If you’re enter-
ing something into the calculator and change
your mind, press this key two times — once
to erase the characters to the right of the
cursor and a second time to erase the rest of
the entry. If you want to erase an entry in
the history area of the Home screen, use the
Arrow keys to highlight that entry and then
press M.
 0: This is equivalent to the Backspace key
on a computer — it erases the character to
the left of the cursor.

You can use the C key to scroll past the top of the screen. If you want to return
to the command line from the history area without placing a new entry on it,
press N.
Editing entries on the command line
The calculator offers four ways to edit an entry on the command line:
 Deleting the entire entry: Press M one or two times to erase an
entry on the command line. If the entry is highlighted or if the cursor is
at the left of the entry, pressing M one time erases the entry; in all
other situations, you need to press M twice to erase the entry.
 Erasing part of an entry: To erase a single character, use the AB keys
to place the cursor to the right of the character you want to erase and
then press 0 to delete that character.
 Inserting characters: Because the insert mode is the default, to insert a
character, just use the AB keys to place the cursor where you want to
insert the character and then key in the character.
 Keying over existing characters: You can press 20 to toggle the
calculator between the Insert and Type Over modes. When the calculator
is in Insert mode, the cursor appears as a vertical line placed between
two characters; in Type Over mode, the cursor is a square that high-
lights a character. Keying in a character while in Type Over mode does
exactly what you’d expect — it replaces the highlighted character with
the character you key in. When you’re finished keying over characters,
press 20 to put the calculator back in Insert mode.
The BUSY Indicator
When the calculator is busy performing calculations, you see the BUSY indi-
cator highlighted at the right of the last line of the screen.

Chapter 1: Coping with the Basics

If the calculator takes too long to graph a function, evaluate an expression, or
execute a command, and you want to abort the process, press ´. When con-
fronted with the Break error message, press N or ¸.
Accessing Applications
The most often used applications, such as Home, Graph, and Table, have
their own key or key combination. For example, press " to go to the
Home screen; to go to the Graph screen, press ¥….
To access the other applications, press O. On the TI-89 Titanium, you see
a screen similar to the one in the first picture in Figure 1-1; on the TI-89, you
see a numbered list of applications. To select an application on the TI-89
Titanium, use the Arrow keys to highlight the desired application and then
press ¸. On the TI-89, you select an application by keying in its number
or by using the CD keys to highlight the application and then pressing ¸.
There isn’t enough space in this book to tell you how to use all of these appli-
cations, but I do tell you how to use Home, Graph, and Table, as well as the
Data/Matrix editor. For a brief explanation of what some of the other applica-
tions can do, see Chapter 23.
Using Menus
You can find most functions and commands in the menus housed in the
calculator — and just about every chapter in this book refers to them. This
section is designed to give you an overview of how to find and select menu
items.
Accessing a menu
Each application has its own set of menus in the Toolbar at the top of the
screen, as illustrated in the second picture in Figure 1-1 appearing earlier in
this chapter. These menus are specific to the application and aren’t always
available in other applications. In addition to the Toolbar menus, the calcula-
tor has several menus that are always available no matter what application
you’re using. MATH and UNITS are examples of such menus.
Each menu, whether it be on the Toolbar or not, has its own key or key com-
bination. For example, to access the F1 Tools menu in the Toolbar, press ƒ.
To access the MATH menu (which you see in the first picture in Figure 1-3),
press 2z. 
16
Part I: Making Friends with the Calculator 

An arrow appearing to the right of a menu item means that that item houses a
submenu. This is illustrated in the first picture in Figure 1-3, in which each
item in the menu houses a submenu. Only the last five items in the menu in
the third picture in Figure 1-3 house submenus.
Scrolling a menu
If a menu contains more items than can be displayed on the screen, a down
or up arrow appears after the number or letter of the last or the first item on
the screen. This is illustrated in the first two pictures in Figure 1-3, in which
the down arrow to the right of the number 8 indicates that there are more
items at the bottom of the menu than can fit on the screen. To see these
menu items, repeatedly press D until they come into view. To get quickly to
the bottom of a menu from the top of the menu, press C. The result of doing
this is illustrated in the third picture of Figure 1-3, in which you now see an
up arrow to the right of E, indicating that there are more items at the top of
this menu than can be displayed on the screen. To quickly get from the
bottom to the top of the menu screen, press D.
Selecting menu items
To select a menu item from a menu, key in the number (or letter) of the item
or use DC to highlight the item and then press ¸.
Press N to exit a menu or submenu without selecting a menu item.
Setting the Mode
The Mode menu, which you access by pressing 3, is the most important
menu on the calculator — among other things, it tells the calculator how you
want numbers and graphs to be displayed. The three screens (pages) that
constitute Mode menu are shown in Figure 1-4. Menu items that are illegible,
such as the third item in the second picture in Figure 1-4, are modes that
aren’t available at the current time. 
Figure 1-3:

menu and

Chapter 1: Coping with the Basics

You set a mode the same way you select an item from a menu (which I
explain in the preceding section). For example, to change the Angle mode
from radians to degrees, press ƒ if you’re not already on page one of the
Mode menu, repeatedly press D until you highlight RADIAN in the Angle
option, press B to display the options in the Angle menu, and then press ©
to select the DEGREE option. I illustrate this procedure in Figure 1-5. 
Here are your choices for the items in the Mode menu. When you finish
making your selections, press ¸ to save your new Mode settings.
 Graph: This setting tells the calculator what type of objects you plan to
graph. Your choices are FUNCTION, PARAMETRIC, POLAR, SEQUENCE,
3D, and DIFF EQUATIONS. These types of graphs are explained later in
this book.
The current Graph mode of the calculator is displayed on the status line.
For example, FUNC on the last line in the first picture of Figure 1-5 indi-
cates that the calculator is set to graph functions of one variable; POL
on the last line in the third picture of Figure 1-5 tells you that the calcula-
tor is set to graph polar equations.
 Current Folder: This setting tells the calculator where it can find the vari-
ables and files you have stored in the calculator. The folders in which you
save variables and files work the same way computer folders do. It is usu-
ally sufficient to save all your variables and files in the default MAIN folder.
I don’t cover creating folders in this book. The active folder appears on
the left end of the status line, as in the first picture in Figure 1-5 (shown
earlier).
 Display Digits: The full value of a number sometimes contains too many
digits to display on the screen. This option tells the calculator how

many digits of a number to display of the screen. FIX n tells the calcula-
tor to round numbers so that n digits appear after the decimal point, and
FLOAT n tells the calculator to round numbers so that a total of n digits
appear. The FLOAT option varies the number of decimal places depend-
ing on the value of the number. If a number can’t be displayed by using
the Display Digits setting, it is displayed in scientific notation.
The default Display Digits setting is FLOAT 6, which is just fine for
normal use. With this setting, 12.3456789 is rounded to 12.3457, a total of
six digits. But if you’re working with money, set this option to FIX 2 so
that all numbers are rounded to two decimal places. 
 Angle: This setting tells the calculator the units it should use when you
enter an angle. Your options are RADIAN and DEGREE. The current Angle
mode of the calculator is displayed on the status line. For example, RAD
on the last line in the first picture of Figure 1-5 (shown earlier) indicates
that the calculator is set to measure all angles in radians.
If you plan to enter some angles in radians and some in degrees, set the
Angle mode to RADIAN. When you want to enter an angle in degrees, just
enter the angle and then press 2Í to tell the calculator to measure
that particular angle in degrees instead of radians.
If you’re planning on graphing trigonometric functions, put the calcula-
tor in Radian mode. Reason: Most trig functions are graphed for –2π ≤x
≤2π. That is approximately –6.28 ≤x ≤6.28. That’s not a bad value for
the limits on the x-axis. But if you graph in Degree mode, you would
need –360 ≤x ≤360 for the limits on the x-axis. This is doable . . . but
trust me, it’s easier to graph in RADIAN mode.
 Exponential Format: This setting controls how the calculator displays
numbers. Your options are NORMAL, SCIENTIFIC, and ENGINEERING. In
NORMAL mode, the calculator displays numbers in the usual numeric
fashion that you used in elementary school — provided it can display
the number by using the current Display Digits mode; if it can’t, the
number is displayed in scientific notation.
In SCIENTIFIC mode, numbers are displayed by using scientific notation,
and in ENGINEERING mode, numbers appear in engineering notation.
The three modes are illustrated in Figure 1-6. 
In scientific and engineering notation, the calculator displays En to
denote multiplication by 10n.

 Complex Format: This mode tells the calculator how to display complex
numbers. In REAL mode, the calculator displays an error message when
confronted with a complex result, as illustrated in the first picture in
Figure 1-7. In the RECTANGULAR and POLAR modes, real numbers are
displayed in the normal fashion and complex numbers are displayed in
the a + bi rectangular format or in the reiθ polar format, as in the last two
pictures in Figure 1-7.
Because you don’t want to get an error message when the calculator
encounters a complex result, set the Complex mode to RECTANGULAR
or POLAR.
 Vector Format: You have three choices, namely RECTANGULAR, 
CYLINDRICAL, and SPHERICAL. In RECTANGULAR mode, two- and 
three-dimensional vectors are displayed as [x, y] and [x, y, z]. In the
CYLINDRICAL and SPHERICAL modes, two-dimensional vectors are dis-
played in [r, θ] polar format. Three-dimensional vectors are displayed by
using cylindrical or spherical coordinates, depending on the selected
mode.
 Pretty Print: You have two options, OFF or ON. When Pretty Print is set
to ON, the entries displayed on the calculator screen look . . . well, they
look pretty, the way they do in a textbook. When it’s set to OFF, the
entries displayed on the screen look the same as those you enter on
the command line. For example, to square 4, you enter 4^2 on the com-
mand line. With Pretty Print ON, the calculator displays 42; when it’s
OFF, the calculator displays 4^2. My recommendation is to leave Pretty
Print ON.
 Split Screen: When this option is set to FULL, only one application is dis-
played on the screen. If you want to see two applications at the same
time, such as a graph and a table, you can select TOP-BOTTOM to dis-
play one application at the top of the screen and the other at the
bottom. You can also select LEFT-RIGHT to display one application on
the left side of the screen and the other on the right. I explain split
screens in Chapters 5 and 6.

Part I: Making Friends with the Calculator 

 Split 1 App, Split 2 App, Number of Graphs, and Graph 2: When the Split
Screen mode is set to FULL, only the Split 1 App option is available. This
option tells the calculator what application is to appear on the screen. In
FULL screen mode, this option is equivalent to selecting an application
from the Application menu, as I describe earlier in this chapter.
If the Split Screen mode is set to either TOP-BOTTOM or LEFT-RIGHT, Split
1 App tells the calculator which application is to appear at the top or at
the left of the screen; Split 2 App tells the calculator which other applica-
tion is to appear on the screen. Set the Number of Graphs option to 2 only
if both parts of the screen are to display graphs; otherwise, set it to 1.
When the Number of Graphs is set to 2, the mode for the first graph is set
by the first (Graph) option in the Mode menu; you use the Graph 2 option
to set the graph mode for this second graph. This, for example, allows
you to view a parametric graph and a polar graph on the same screen.
 Exact/Approximate: You have three choices, AUTO, EXACT, and
APPROXIMATE. As expected, in EXACT mode, the calculator gives only
the exact value of all results, and in APPROXIMATE mode, all results are
displayed as decimal approximations. In EXACT mode, if the calculator
can’t simplify the expression you entered, it simply redisplays the exact
same expression you entered. AUTO mode, however, is the best of both
worlds because it displays the exact value when possible; otherwise, it
displays the approximate value. 
Set the Exact/Approximate mode to AUTO. Then if the calculator gives
you an exact result and you want to approximate it, simply press ¥¸.
 Base: If you aren’t a computer scientist or an engineer, you want to set
this option to DEC so that your numbers are displayed in base 10. HEX
displays numbers in base 16 and BIN in base 2.
 Unit System and Custom Units: Select SI or ENG/US if you want results
involving units to use the scientific (metric) or English units. With these
modes, the Custom Units option is not available. Select CUSTOM if you
want to specify your own basic units of measure. Then define these units
of measure in the Custom Units option. 
 Language: Well, if you’re reading this book, you might as well set this to
English.
A common prank is to set someone’s calculator to a language he can’t
read. If this happens to you, press 3…DB¨¸ to reset the 
calculator to English. If the prankster also set the Unit System mode
to CUSTOM, you have to press 3…DDB¨¸ to reset the calcu-
lator to English.
 Apps Desktop: This item is available only on the TI-89 Titanium. When
Apps Desktop is set to ON, applications are displayed in picture form,
as in the first picture in Figure 1-1. When it’s set to OFF, applications
appear in list format.

Chapter 1: Coping with the Basics

Using the CATALOG
The calculator’s CATALOG houses every command and function used by the
calculator. However, it’s easier to use the keyboard and the menus to access
these commands and functions than it is to use the CATALOG. Several excep-
tions exist, however; for example, the log function isn’t housed in any of the
calculator’s menus. To use this command, you have to key it into the calcula-
tor or select it from the CATALOG. If you have to use the CATALOG, here’s
how to do it:
1. If necessary, use the Arrow keys to place the cursor at the location
where you want to insert a command or function found in the
CATALOG.
2. Press ½ and enter the first letter in the name of the command or
function.
The calculator is automatically placed in Alpha mode, so to enter the
letter, just press the key corresponding to that letter. (I explain Alpha
mode and entering text earlier in this chapter in the section titled “Using
the É and ¤ keys to write text.”) After entering the letter, the calcu-
lator displays the CATALOG options that begin with that letter.
3. Repeatedly press DC to move the indicator to the desired command
or function.
4. Press ¸ to select the command or function.
Setting the Clock
The clock on the TI-89 is visible only in the Calendar and Planner applica-
tions; on the TI-89 Titanium, it is also visible on the Application screen. (The
upper-right corner of the first picture in Figure 1-1, appearing earlier in this
chapter, shows a clock in desperate need of setting.) To set the clock, follow
these steps:
1. Press " if you aren’t already on the Home screen and then press
ƒCü to choose Clock from the Tools menu.
If Clock doesn’t appear as an item in the Tools menu on your TI-89, you
need to upgrade the operating system of your calculator if you want it to
be endowed with a clock. You find out how to do this in Chapter 21.
2. Press B and then either press ¨ for a 12-hour clock or press © for a
24-hour clock.
22
Part I: Making Friends with the Calculator 

3. Press D and use the number keys to enter the current hour. Then
press D and key in the minutes.
4. Press DB¨ to select AM or press DB© to select PM.
5. Press DB and then press the key corresponding to the number of the
date format of your choice.
6. Press D and use the number keys to enter the current year.
7. Press DB and then press the key corresponding to the number of the
current month.
8. Press D and use the number keys to enter the current day of the
month.
9. Press DB© to turn on the clock and then press ¸ to save your
settings.

hen you use the calculator to evaluate an arithmetic expression such
as 510 + 46, the format in which the calculator displays the answer
depends on how you’ve set the mode of the calculator. Do you want answers
displayed in scientific notation? Do you want all numbers rounded to two
decimal places? Setting the mode of the calculator affords you the opportunity
to tell the calculator how you want these, and other questions, answered.
(I explain setting the mode in Chapter 1.) When you’re doing basic, real-number
arithmetic, the mode is set as described in Chapter 1.
Entering and Evaluating Expressions
Arithmetic expressions are evaluated on the Home screen. If the Home screen
isn’t already displayed on the calculator, press " to display it. If you want
to clear the contents of the Home screen, press ƒn.
You enter arithmetic expressions in the calculator the same way you would
write them on paper if you were restricted to using the division sign (/)
for fractional notation. This restriction sometimes requires parentheses
around the numerator or the denominator, as illustrated in the first picture
in Figure 2-1, in which I used parentheses for the second entry but not the
first.

When entering numbers, don’t use commas. For example, enter the number
1,000,000 in the calculator as 1000000.
After entering the expression, press ¸ to evaluate it. The calculator dis-
plays the answer to the right of the expression, as shown in Figure 2-1.
Finding Important Keys
Starting with the fifth row of the calculator, you find the functions commonly
used on a scientific calculator. Here’s what they are and how you use them:
 π: To enter the transcendental number π in an expression, press 2Z,
as shown in the first line of Figure 2-2.
 The logarithmic and exponential functions: The natural log (ln x) and
exponential (ex) functions are located above the Ù (letter X) key in the
left column of keys. To enter the natural log function in an expression,
press 2Ù; for the exponential function, press ¥Ù. After entering
the function, use the number keys to enter the argument and then
press d to close the parentheses. This is illustrated in the second line
of Figure 2-2, where e(1) is used to enter the transcendental number e in
an expression.
Figure 2-1:

Part I: Making Friends with the Calculator 
| versus ·
The subtraction (|) key and the negation (·)
key are entirely different. They are not inter-
changeable. Use the | key to indicate subtrac-
tion; use the · key before a number to identify
that number as negative. If you improperly use
· to indicate a subtraction problem, or if you
improperly use | to indicate that a number is
negative, you get an error message. You can
see the use of these two symbols in the second
picture in Figure 2-1.

There is no special key for the common log (log x) function. It must be
written as text in Alpha mode or selected from the CATALOG. (I cover
writing text in Alpha mode and using the CATALOG in Chapter 1.) These
are the keystrokes for entering log in Alpha mode: 2Éy|mÉ.
Evaluating log(10) appears in the third line of Figure 2-2.
 The trigonometric and inverse trigonometric functions: You find the
most often used trigonometric functions and their inverses in the fifth
row of the keyboard. These functions require that the argument of the
function be enclosed in parentheses. To remind you of this, the calcula-
tor provides the first parenthesis for you. You must supply the argument
and the closing parenthesis. For example, the keystrokes for the first
entry in Figure 2-2 are: ¥Ú2Û2Zdd¸.
The other trigonometric functions and their inverses are housed in the
MATH Trig menu. The section in Chapter 3 on evaluating sec, csc, cot,
sec–1, csc–1, and cot–1 tells you how to use this menu.
 The square-root function: The square-root function is located above
the p (times) key in the right column of keys. As with all functions, the
square-root function requires that its argument be enclosed in parenthe-
ses. To remind you of this, the calculator provides the first parenthesis
for you. You must supply the argument and the closing parenthesis 
(as in the entry on the command line of the picture in Figure 2-2).
Using the MATH Number Menu
If you want to evaluate an arithmetic expression and you need a function
other than those listed in the preceding section, you most likely can find that
function in the MATH Number menu. 
The trigonometric functions and their inverses are housed in the MATH Trig
menu. The section in Chapter 3 on evaluating trig functions tells you how to
use this menu.
Figure 2-2:
Examples of

Chapter 2: Doing Basic Arithmetic

The hyperbolic functions are housed in the MATH Hyperbolic menu. The sec-
tion in Chapter 12 about dealing with hyperbolic functions tells you how to use
this menu.
To display the MATH Number menu, press 2zB. The functions housed in
the MATH Number menu are shown in the two pictures in Figure 2-3. After
selecting a function from this menu, you must supply the argument and then
press d to close the parenthetical expression. Here’s what these functions do:
 exact: This function converts a decimal to a fraction.
 abs: This is the absolute value function.
 round: This function rounds a number to a specified number of decimal
places. Its format is round(number, digits). For example, round(40/29, 2)
returns 1.38 (40/29 rounded to two decimal places).
 iPart and fPart: The iPart function returns the integer part of a number
and fPart returns the fractional part of the number. For example,
iPart(40/29) = 1 and fPart(40/29) = 11/29.
 floor and ceiling: The floor function of a number is the largest integer
that is less than or equal to that number; the ceiling function is the small-
est integer that is greater than or equal to the number. For example,
floor(12.35) = 12 and ceiling(12.35) = 13.
 sign: This function tells you whether the argument is negative or positive
by returning –1 if it’s negative and 1 if it’s positive. If the argument is 0,
the calculator returns either ±1 or sign(0), depending on the Mode set-
ting of the calculator. For example, sign(e – π) = –1.
 mod and remain: Both functions, mod(n, d) and remain(n, d), find the
remainder when integer n (the dividend) is divided by nonzero integer
d (the divisor), but they use different formulas to find this remainder. As a
consequence, there are some circumstances in which the remainder found
by these functions is a negative integer. If you’re doing modular arithmetic,
in which it doesn’t matter whether the result is negative, use the mod
function. On the other hand, if you’re doing a long division problem and
want to find a remainder that is zero or a positive integer, do the following:
• Use mod(n, d) when the divisor d is positive. For example,
mod(11, 3) = 2 and mod(–11, 3) = 1. 
• Use remain(n, d) when the dividend n is nonnegative and the
divisor d is negative. For example, remain(11, –3) = 2.
• Use pencil and paper when both the dividend n and divisor d are
negative. In this situation, both the mod and remain functions give
negative results. For example, mod(–11, –3) = remain(–11, –3) = –2.
As a workaround, you can add the absolute value of the divisor
to the result given by either function to find the zero or positive
integer remainder. For example, when –11 is divided by –3, the
remainder is mod(–11, –3) + 3 = –2 + 3 = 1.
28
Part I: Making Friends with the Calculator 

 lcm and gcd: These functions find the least common multiple and
greatest common divisor, respectively, of two integers. For example,
lcm(8, –6) = 24 and gcd(8, –6) = 2. To find the least common multiple
of three integers, enter the function as lcm(a, lcm(b, c)). Similarly,
gcd(a, gcd(b, c)) finds the greatest common divisor of the integers a,
b, and c.
Understanding the Order of Operations
The order in which the calculator performs operations is the standard order
that everyone uses. Spelled out in detail, here is the order in which the calcu-
lator performs operations:
1. The calculator simplifies all expressions surrounded by parentheses.
2. The calculator evaluates all functions that require an argument.
Examples of such functions are ln, sin, and all the functions listed in the
preceding section.
3. The calculator evaluates all expressions raised to an exponent.
4. The calculator negates all expressions preceded by the negation
symbol — the symbol entered by pressing ·.
Evaluating –3^2 might not give you the expected answer. We think of –3
as being a single, negative number. So when we square it, we expect to
get +9. But the calculator gets –9. This happens because, according to the
order of operations, the calculator first squares the 3 and then negates
the result. To avoid this potentially hazardous problem, always surround
negative numbers with parentheses before raising them to a power.
5. The calculator evaluates all multiplication and division problems as it
encounters them, proceeding from left to right.
6. The calculator evaluates all addition and subtraction problems as it
encounters them, proceeding from left to right.

Chapter 2: Doing Basic Arithmetic

Well, okay, what does the phrase “x plus 1 divided by x minus 2” actually
mean when you say it aloud? Well, that depends on how you say it. Said with-
out pausing, it means (x + 1)/(x −2). Said with a subtle pause after the “plus”
and another before the “minus,” it means x + (1/x) – 2. The calculator can’t
hear speech inflection, so make good use of those parentheses when you’re
“talking” to the calculator.
Using a Previous Answer
You can use a previous answer in an arithmetic expression you want to evalu-
ate. To enter this answer in your expression, use the C key to highlight the
answer and then press ¸ to place it in your expression. This is illustrated
in Figure 2-4.
If you want to start an expression with the previous answer, all you have to
do is key in the first operation that is to appear after the answer — the calcu-
lator automatically knows to use the previous answer. For example if you add
1+2 and then want to divide the answer by 3, simply key in eª and then
press ¸ to evaluate the result.
If you want to reuse a command, function, or expression that you previously
entered in the calculator — but with different instructions, arguments, or
variables — simply recall that command, function, or expression and then
edit it. I tell you how to do this in Chapter 1.
Storing Variables
If you plan to use the same number many times when evaluating arithmetic
expressions, consider storing that number in a variable. In this context, a
variable is simply a name you give to the number. To store a number in a vari-
able, follow these steps:
Highlight answer

Part I: Making Friends with the Calculator 

1. If necessary, press " to enter the Home screen.
2. Enter the number you want to store in a variable.
You can store the number as an arithmetic expression. This is illustrated
in the first entry in Figure 2-5. After you complete the steps for storing
the number, the calculator evaluates that expression.
3. Press §.
4. Press É and then press the key corresponding to the letter of the
variable in which you want to store the number.
The first picture in Figure 2-5 shows this process. The letters used for
storing variables are the letters of the alphabet and the Greek letter θ.
If you want to give your number a name consisting of more than one letter,
press 2É and then press the keys corresponding to the letters in
the name. The name can have no more than eight characters.
5. Press ¸ to store the value.
This is illustrated in the first entry in Figure 2-5.
The number you store in a variable remains stored in that variable until you
delete the variable or until you or the calculator stores a new number in that
variable. Because the calculator uses the letters x, y, z, t, n, and θ when
graphing functions, parametric equations, sequences, and polar equations,
the calculator might change the value stored in these variables when the cal-
culator is in graphing mode. For example, if you store a number in the vari-
able x and then ask the calculator to find the zero of the graphed function x2,
the calculator replaces the number stored in x with 0, the zero of x2. So avoid
storing a value in one of these variables (x, y, z, t, n, and θ) if you want that
value to remain stored in that variable after you have graphed functions,
parametric equations, sequences, or polar equations.
After you have stored a number in a variable, you can insert that number
into an arithmetic expression. To do so, place the cursor where you want
the number to appear, and then key in the name of the variable in which the
number is stored. This is illustrated in the second entry in Figure 2-5. 
Figure 2-5:
Storing a

Chapter 2: Doing Basic Arithmetic

Deleting Stored Variables
If you stored a number in variable a and then at a later date use that variable
name for something else (like getting the calculator to display the quadratic
formula by having it solve the equation ax2 + bx + c = 0), the calculator does
something you don’t want it to do — it replaces a with the number stored in
a. So, after you finish using a stored variable, make sure you delete it from
the memory of the calculator. 
To delete all variables that have one-letter names, press 2ƒ¨¸. To
delete all one-letter named variables and also clear the Home screen, press
2ƒ©¸¸.
To delete a single variable, whether it has a single- or multi-character name,
follow these steps: 
1. Press 2| to display the VAR-LINK screen. 
2. Repeatedly press D to highlight the name of the variable you want to
delete.
Variables containing numbers have the extension EXPR displayed to the
right of their names.
3. Press ƒ¨¸ to delete that variable from the memory of the
calculator. 
4. Press N to exit the VAR-LINK screen.
32
Part I: Making Friends with the Calculator 
Implied multiplication (juxtaposition)
Do not use juxtaposition (ab) to denote the prod-
uct of two stored variables a and b. If you do,
you get garbage or an error message because
the calculator interprets ab as being a single
entity having a two-letter name. My recommen-
dation is to always use the p key when you’re
multiplying.

To delete several variables on the VAR-LINK screen, use the D key to highlight
one variable and press † to place a check next to it. Continue this process
until you have placed a check mark next to all the variables you want to delete.
Then press ƒ¨¸ to delete the checked variables.
Combining Expressions
You can combine (link) several expressions or commands into one expression
by using a colon to separate the expressions or commands. (You enter a
colon by pressing 2y.) Combining expressions is a really handy way to
write mini-programs, as I detail in the “Writing a mini-program” sidebar.
33
Chapter 2: Doing Basic Arithmetic
Writing a mini-program
This figure depicts a program that calculates n2
when n is a positive integer. The first line of the
program initiates the program by storing the
value 1 in n and calculating its square. (I explain
storing a number in a variable and combining
expressions earlier in this chapter.)
The next line on the left shows the real guts of
the program. It increments n by 1 and then cal-
culates the square of the new value of n. Of
course, the calculator doesn’t do these calcu-
lations until after you press ¸. But the
really neat thing about this is that the calcula-
tor continues to execute this same command
each time you press ¸. Because n is
incremented by 1 each time you press ¸,
you get the values of n 2 when n is a positive
integer.

his chapter really shows off the Computer Algebra System (CAS) features
of the calculator. It tells you how to get the calculator to factor polynomi-
als, simplify algebraic and trigonometric expressions, solve systems of equa-
tions, and so on. It even tells you how to get the calculator to tell you those
trigonometric formulas you might have forgotten, such as the half-angle
formulas.
Evaluating Functions
Do you need to evaluate tan(π/12) or ln(2)? Or do you have your own special
function that you need to evaluate at several different values of the indepen-
dent variable? If so, this section tells you how to do this and much, much more.
Dealing with user-defined functions
The calculator comes equipped with many built-in functions like sin(x) and
ex, but there are often times when you want to define your own function. For
example, if you want the calculator to graph f(x) = x3 + 2x2 + 3x + 1, factor f(x),

and evaluate f(2), you’d store the definition of this function in the calculator
so that each time you used the function to do a different task you could refer-
ence it by name, f(x), instead of having to key in its rather long definition.
Creating a user-defined function
On the Home screen, there are two ways to save the definition of a function in
the calculator so that you can later refer to it by its name. One way is to use
the § key to store the definition in the function name the same way you
store a number in a variable name, as I explain in Chapter 2. This is illus-
trated in the first line of the first picture in Figure 3-1. (You enter the arrow in
this line by pressing §, and you enter the letter f by pressing ÉÍ.)
The other way to define a function on the Home screen is by using the Define
command, as illustrated in the third line of the first picture in Figure 3-1. You
enter the Define command by pressing †¨, and this command requires
that you enter the function in the format function name = function definition.
(The Á key is in the middle of the left column of keys.)
The name you give a user-defined function can be, for example, in the form
f(x), g(y), harry(a), or just plain h, as in the third function in the first picture
in Figure 3-1. The advantage of naming the function h instead of harry(a) or
h(a) is that entering the function name takes fewer keystrokes. And an abbre-
viated function name, such as h, is acceptable to the calculator when per-
forming basic algebraic operations such as evaluating or factoring the
function. But if you also want to graph the function, you must use the h(x),
h(a) or harry(y) format for the function name because the calculator’s graph-
ing program requires that you specify the argument of the function. If you ask
the calculator to graph the user-defined function h, you get an error message.
Evaluating user-defined functions
Evaluating a user-defined function depends on how the function is named.
To evaluate a function whose name also specifies the independent variable,
such as the first two functions in the first picture in Figure 3-1, simply enter
the name of the function, press c, enter the value of the independent vari-
able, press d, and then press ¸, as illustrated in the first line of the
second picture of Figure 3-1.
Figure 3-1:
Defining and
using user-
defined
functions.
38
Part II: Doing Algebra and Trigonometry 

To evaluate a function whose name doesn’t specify the independent variable,
such as the third function in the first picture in Figure 3-1, enter the name of
the function, press Í (the with command), enter the name of the independent
variable, press Á, enter the value of the independent variable, and then press
¸, as illustrated in the second line of the second picture of Figure 3-1.
(The with command, Í, is under the Á key in the left column of keys.)
The last two lines of the second picture in Figure 3-1 show examples of evalu-
ating arithmetic combinations of user-defined functions in which one function
specifies the independent variable and the other doesn’t. The user-defined
functions in this figure are those appearing in the first picture of this figure. In
the third line in the second picture in Figure 3-1, the value of the independent
variable for the first function is defined by g(1). This is allowable because the
name of this function — g(y) — uses the independent variable. But the second
function h isn’t defined by using its independent variable, so it is necessary to
specify the value of its variable by using the with command.
The last line of the second picture of Figure 3-1 illustrates a situation in which
you need to use the with command, Í, to tell the calculator the values of two
different independent variables; namely the value of the independent variable
y for function g and the independent variable a for function h. This is achieved
by connecting these values with the and command. You enter the and com-
mand into the calculator by pressing 2znn to select this command from
the MATH Test menu.
Graphing user-defined functions
The calculator is capable of graphing only the user-defined functions that
specify the independent variable in the name of the function, such as the
first two functions in the first picture in Figure 3-1. Moreover, when graphing
functions, the calculator requires that the independent variable be denoted
by x. But if your user-defined function uses some other letter to denote the
independent variable, that’s okay. The next paragraph tells you how to
handle such a situation.
The third picture in Figure 3-1 illustrates how user-defined functions are
entered in the Y= editor so that the calculator can graph them. (I explain
using the Y= editor and graphing functions in Chapter 5.) If the function is
defined as a function of x, simply enter the function name in the Y= editor,
as illustrated in y1 in this picture, and then graph the function. On the other
hand, if the function isn’t a function of x, as with the second function in the
first picture in Figure 3-1, just use the variable x instead of the variable
used in defining the function, as illustrated in y2 in the third picture in
Figure 3-1, in which function g was originally defined as a function of the

Evaluating trig functions
Some of the trigonometric functions are found on the calculator’s keypad,
and some are not. The sine, cosine, and tangent functions, and their inverses,
appear in the fifth row of calculator keys above the Ú, Û, and Ü keys, but
the cosecant, cosine, and cotangent functions and their inverses are housed
in the MATH Trig menu. This section tells you how to access and use all these
trigonometric functions.
Evaluating sine, cosine, and tangent
To evaluate the sine, cosine, or tangent function on the Home screen, follow
these steps:
1. If you aren’t already on the Home screen, press ".
" is the fourth key from the top in the left column of keys.
2. Press 2.
3. Press Ú to evaluate sin, Û to evaluate cos, or Ü to evaluate tan.
The function appears on the command line followed by a left parenthe-
sis, as illustrated in the first picture in Figure 3-2.
4. Enter the value of the argument (angle) of the function, as illustrated
in the second picture of Figure 3-2.
The angle you enter for the argument must agree with the Angle mode
(radians or degrees) of the calculator. This mode appears at the bottom
of the screen of the calculator, as illustrated in the first picture of Figure
3-2, where RAD indicates that the calculator is in Radian mode. A calcu-
lator in Degree mode displays DEG at the bottom of the screen. (I explain
setting the Angle mode in Chapter 1.)
It is possible to override the Angle mode of the calculator. If your cal-
culator is in Radian mode and you want to enter an angle in degrees,
simply enter the degree measure of the angle and then press 2Í to
place the degree symbol after the entry. If the calculator is in Degree
mode and you enter an angle in radians, press 2z©© to place the
radian symbol after the entry. A radian angle such as π/4 must first be
enclosed in parentheses before placing the radian symbol after it.

5. Press d to close the parentheses.
6. Press ¸ to evaluate the function, as illustrated in the second pic-
ture in Figure 3-2. 
If your calculator is in Exact or Auto mode, as indicated by the word
EXACT or AUTO appearing at the bottom of the screen, the calculator
finds the exact value of the function when possible. If your calculator is
in Approximate mode, as indicated by the word APPROX at the bottom
of the screen, the calculator approximates the value of the function
even when an exact value exists. You find out about setting the Mode
in Chapter 1.
7. If the calculator’s answer is exactly what you entered, as in the first
line of the third picture in Figure 3-2, press ¥¸ to approximate
the value of the function, as illustrated in the last line of this figure.
Evaluating sin-1, cos-1, and tan-1
To evaluate sin-1, cos-1, or tan-1 on the Home screen, follow these steps:
1. If you aren’t already on the Home screen, press ".
2. Press ¥.
3. Press Ú to evaluate sin-1, press Û to evaluate cos-1, or press Ü to eval-
uate tan-1.
The function appears on the command line, followed by a left parenthesis.
4. Enter the value of the argument of the function. Then press d to close
the parentheses.
5. Press ¸ to find the exact value of the function or press ¥¸ to
approximate the value of the function.
If the calculator is in Radian mode, as indicated by RAD at the bottom of
the screen, the exact or approximate value the calculator returns for the
inverse trigonometric function is in radians; otherwise, it’s in degrees. 
If you press ¸ and the calculator returns exactly what you entered,
this means that the calculator is unable to find the exact value of the
function. In this case, press ¥¸ to have the calculator approximate
the value. If your calculator is in Approximate mode, the calculator
always returns an approximation of the value of the function even if an
exact value exists. (See Chapter 1 for information on setting the Mode.)
Evaluating sec, csc, cot, sec-1, csc-1, and cot-1
The secant, cosecant, and cotangent functions and their inverses are housed
in the MATH Trig menu on the calculators that have an up-to-date operating
system. All TI-89 Titanium calculators contain the MATH Trig menu, but some
older, non-Titanium TI-89’s do not. To see whether your TI-89 (non-Titanium)
calculator has an up-to-date operating system, press " if you aren’t on
the Home screen and then press ƒC. If Clock is the last entry you see on the
41
Chapter 3: Solving Equations, Factoring, and Other Great Stuff

screen, your calculator’s operating system is up-to-date enough to contain
the MATH Trig menu; if the last entry is About, you need to upgrade the
operating system in order to access the MATH Trig menu. The sidebar in this
chapter, titled “Dealing with an out-of-date OS,” tells how to update the oper-
ating system so that your calculator does contain the MATH Trig menu. It
also tells you how to handle the secant, cosecant, and cotangent functions
and their inverses if you’re unable to upgrade an out-of-date operating
system.
To evaluate the secant, cosecant, or cotangent functions or their inverses on
the Home screen, follow these steps:
1. If you aren’t already on the Home screen, press ".
2. Press 2zC to display the second screen of the MATH menu, as illus-
trated in the first picture in Figure 3-3.
3. Press CCCC¸ (or equivalently, press ÉÁ) to select A: Trig
from this menu.
The menu housing the trigonometric functions appears on the screen, as
illustrated in the second picture of Figure 3-3.
If you don’t see the A: Trig option on this menu, your calculator has an
out-of-date operating system. See the sidebar in this chapter titled
“Dealing with an out-of-date OS” for information on what to do in this
situation.
4. If the function you want to evaluate doesn’t appear in this menu, press
C to display the rest of the menu, as illustrated in the third picture in
Figure 3-3. 
5. Use the CD keys to highlight the function you want to evaluate and
then press ¸.
The function appears on the command line followed by a left parenthe-
sis, as illustrated in the first picture in Figure 3-2.

6. If you’re evaluating sec, csc, or cot, follow Steps 4 through 7 in the
section titled “Evaluating sine, cosine, and tangent.” If you’re evaluat-
ing sec-1, csc-1, or cot-1, follow Steps 4 and 5 in the section titled
“Evaluating sin-1, cos-1, and tan-1.”
Evaluating exponential and
logarithmic functions
Evaluating exponential functions is fairly straightforward on a TI-89, but do
you know how to find the value of e? Evaluating the natural log function is
also straightforward, but do you know how to find log10(2) or log5(2)? This
section tells you how to accomplish these tasks.
Dealing with exponential functions
The exponential function ex is above the Ù key in the left column of keys on
the calculator. It appears in the same color as the ¥ key. So to evaluate this
function on the Home screen, press ¥Ù. The function appears on the com-
mand line followed by a left parenthesis. Enter the value of the exponent,
press d to close the parentheses, and then press ¸ to display the exact
value of the function (as illustrated in the first line of the first picture in
Figure 3-4) or press ¥¸ to display an approximate value (as in the
second line of this picture). For example, the keystrokes for approximating
the value of e are ¥Ù¨d¥¸, as illustrated in the third line of the first
picture in Figure 3-4.
If you press ¸ to evaluate an expression and get an exact answer when
you really wanted an approximate answer, simply press ¥¸ to tell the
calculator to approximate that last answer.
You enter all other exponential functions by using the Z key, which is located
in the right column of keys on the calculator. For example, because π is
located above the Z key, the keystrokes for approximating the cubed root of
Figure 3-4:
Evaluating

43
Chapter 3: Solving Equations, Factoring, and Other Great Stuff

π are 2ZZc¨eªd¥¸, as illustrated in the last line of the first pic-
ture in Figure 3-4. On the other hand, if you want to display the approximate
value of π, no exponent is necessary; simply press 2Z to enter π on the
command line and then press ¥¸ to approximate its value.
Dealing with logarithmic functions
The calculator has commands for evaluating the natural log function ln(x)
and the common log function log10(x). Even though the calculator does not
house commands for evaluating a logarithmic function to a base other than e
or 10, you can always use the natural log function ln(x) and the conversion
logb(x) = ln(x)/ln(b) to evaluate such functions. In this section, I explain how
to evaluate the natural and common logarithmic functions.
The natural log function ln(x) is above the Ù key in the left column of keys
on the calculator. It appears in the same color as the 2 key. So to evaluate
this function on the Home screen, press 2Ù. The function appears on the
command line, followed by a left parenthesis. Enter the value of the argu-
ment, press d to close the parentheses, and then press ¸ to display the
exact value of the function (as illustrated in the first line of the second pic-
ture in Figure 3-4) or press ¥¸ to display an approximate value (as on
the second line of this picture).
If you press ¸ to evaluate an expression and get an exact answer when
you really wanted an approximate answer, press ¥¸ to tell the calculator
to approximate that last answer.
The natural log function ln(x) has base e. To evaluate the common log func-
tion log10(x), follow these steps:
1. If you aren’t already on the Home screen, press ".
2. Press ½y to display the commands in the CATALOG that begin
with the letter L.
3. Press 2D to display the second screen in this menu. Then repeat-
edly press D to move the arrow indicator to the left of the log( entry,
as illustrated in the third picture in Figure 3-4.
4. Press ¸ to place the log function on the command line.
5. Enter the argument of the function and then press d to close the
parentheses.
6. Press ¥¸ to approximate the value of the function, as illustrated
in the third line of the second picture in Figure 3-4.
To evaluate logb(x), use the conversion logb(x) = ln(x)/ln(b). This is illustrated
in the last line in the second picture in Figure 3-4, where the value of log5(2) is
approximated.
44
Part II: Doing Algebra and Trigonometry 

Solving Equations and Inequalities
You use the solve command in the Algebra menu to solve equations and
inequalities. You can even use it to solve small systems of two equations in
two unknowns. For large systems of equations, such as a system of three
equations in three unknowns, it is usually easier to use matrices to solve the
system of equations. (See Chapter 17 for more on using matrices to solve sys-
tems of equations.) This section tells you how to use the solve command to
solve equations, inequalities, and systems of equations.
Solving a single equation or inequality
The solve command is used to find the real solutions to an equation or
inequality, and the cSolve command is used to find both the real and com-
plex solutions. I explain using the cSolve command later in this chapter, in
the section “Finding complex solutions.” To use the solve command to find
the real solutions to an equation or inequality, follow these steps:
1. If you aren’t already on the Home screen, press ".
2. Press „¨ to invoke the solve command.
The solve command appears on the command line, followed by a left
parenthesis.
3. Enter the equation or inequality to be solved, as illustrated in the first
two pictures in Figure 3-5.
You can use any letter or name for the variables and constants in the
equation or inequality, as illustrated in Figure 3-5. The key for the equal
sign is in the middle of the left column of keys. You enter the < symbol
by pressing 2µ, and you enter > by pressing 2¶. The other inequal-
ity symbols are housed in the MATH Test menu, which you access by
pressing 2zn, as illustrated in the third picture in Figure 3-5. For
example, to enter ≤in an inequality, press 2znª.
Use p (the times key) when entering the product of two letters that rep-
resent different variables or constants. If you don’t, the calculator inter-
prets the two juxtaposed letters as being a two-letter name for a single
variable. For example, to the calculator, ax2 is the square of the single
variable having the two-letter name ax; whereas the calculator views
a x
2
:
as the product of the variable a and the square of the variable x.
The absolute value of a quantity is entered into an expression by press-
ing 2zB© to select the abs command from the MATH Number menu,
keying in the quantity, and then pressing d to enclose that quantity in
the absolute value symbols, as illustrated on the command line in the
first picture in Figure 3-5. 
45
Chapter 3: Solving Equations, Factoring, and Other Great Stuff

4. Press b and then enter the name of the variable you want to solve
for, as illustrated in the first two pictures in Figure 3-5. Then press d
to close the parentheses.
5. Press ¸ to solve the equation or inequality.
If the calculator is unable to display all solutions in one line, as in the
second line in the first picture in Figure 3-5, use the C to highlight that
line and then repeatedly press B to display the other solutions. To
return to the command line, press ¥DD.
The calculator isn’t very good at solving inequalities, as illustrated in the
second picture in Figure 3-5. The calculator has no problem with linear inequal-
ities in one variable, such as in the first line in this picture, but, as the other
entries in this picture indicate, its ability to solve other types of inequalities is
usually quite disappointing. Sorry folks, but that’s the nature of the beast!
If you used the solve command to solve a trigonometric equation and the
answer contains symbols like @n1, @n2, and so on, see the section “Solving
trigonometric equations” later in this chapter to discover the meaning of
these symbols.
Have you forgotten the quadratic formula? No problem — just use the solve
command to solve the equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 for x. 
Solving a system of equations
Solving large systems of equations on the Home screen is doable, but keying
in all those equations is time consuming. If you often have to solve a system
of three or more equations, I suggest that you look at Chapter 17 to find out
how to use matrices to solve your large systems of equations.
To solve a system of equations on the Home screen, follow these steps:
1. If you aren’t already on the Home screen, press ".
2. Press „¨ to invoke the solve command.
3. Enter the first equation in the system of equations.
Figure 3-5:
Solving

and

46
Part II: Doing Algebra and Trigonometry 

For details on entering the equation, see the explanation after Step 3 in
the previous section titled “Solving a single equation or inequality.” 
4. Press 2znn to insert the word and from the MATH Test menu.
The MATH Test menu is displayed in the third picture in Figure 3-5.
5. Enter the next equation in the system of equations.
6. If your system has more than two equations, repeat Steps 4 and 5 until
you’ve entered all the equations in the system.
7. Press b to indicate that all equations in the system have been entered.
8. Enter the variables in the system as a list.
Lists are housed within braces and separated by commas, as illustrated
on the command line in Figure 3-6. To enter your list of variables, follow
these steps:
a. Press 2c to enter the first brace.
b. Enter the first variable in your system of equations.
c. Press b and enter the next variable.
d. If your system has more than two variables, repeat the previous
step until you’ve entered all the variables.
e. Press 2d to close the braces.
9. Press d to close the parentheses.
10. Press ¸ to solve the system of equations, as illustrated in Figure 3-6.
If the calculator can’t display all solutions in one line, as in the second
line in the first picture in Figure 3-5, use the C to highlight that line and
then repeatedly press B to display the other solutions. To return to the
command line, press ¥DD.
Finding particular solutions to equations
There are times when you might be interested in seeing only particular 
solutions to an equation or system of equations instead of seeing all solu-
tions. For example, you might want only the positive solutions or only the
solutions between zero and one. Being able to display only particular solu-
tions instead of all solutions is quite handy when the equation or system of
Figure 3-6:
Solving a
system of
equations. 
47
Chapter 3: Solving Equations, Factoring, and Other Great Stuff

equations has so many solutions that you’d have to use the arrow keys to
search amongst all solutions in order to find the ones you want. This is illus-
trated in the first picture in Figure 3-7, in which only a portion of the positive
solutions is displayed on the screen. (I explain how to define a function, such
as the function in this picture, earlier in this chapter in the section, “Creating
user-defined functions.”)
You find particular solutions to an equation or system of equations by using
the with command to place restrictions on the solutions found by the calcu-
lator. These restrictions must be in the form x ≤a, x ≥a, or a ≤x ≤b, where x
is the variable in the equation or system of equations and a and b are real
numbers. The inequalities can be strict inequalities (that is, you can replace
≤with < or ≥with >).
To find particular solutions to an equation or system of equations, follow
these steps:
1. If you’re finding particular solutions to an equation, follow Steps 1
through 4 in the section “Solving a single equation or inequality.” If
you’re finding particular solutions to a system of equations, follow
Steps 1 through 9 in the section “Solving a system of equations.”
2. Press Í to insert the with command.
Í is the fourth key from the bottom of the left column of keys.
3. Enter the restrictions on the solutions that define the particular solu-
tions you want to find.
These restrictions must be in the form x ≤a, x ≥a, or a ≤x ≤b, where x
denotes the variable used in the equation or system of equations. The
inequalities can be strict inequalities; for example, the strict inequality
corresponding to ≤is <. 
An expression of the form a ≤x ≤b must be entered as “a ≤x and x ≤b,”
as illustrated on the command line in the second picture in Figure 3-7,
in which the inequalities are strict inequalities. The symbols for the
inequalities and for the word and are housed in the MATH Test menu
(as illustrated in the third picture in Figure 3-5). Press 2zn to access
this menu and then press the number of the desired option to insert that
option on the command line. For example, to insert the word and, press
2znn.
Figure 3-7:
Finding
particular
solutions.
48
Part II: Doing Algebra and Trigonometry 

You can enter the < symbol into an expression by simply pressing 2µ;
to enter > press 2¶.
It makes perfect sense to us to, for example, find those solutions to an
equation that are less than –1 or greater than 1. But when using the
with command to find particular solutions to an equation, the calculator
doesn’t accept the or command. If you use it, you get the “Constraint
expression invalid” error message, as illustrated in the third picture in
Figure 3-7. You can, of course, solve the equation twice — first using the
restriction x ≤–1 and then using x ≥1 — but you can’t solve them simul-
taneously on the calculator.
4. Press ¸ to find the particular solutions, as illustrated in the
second picture in Figure 3-7.
Solving trigonometric equations
As illustrated in the first two pictures in Figure 3-8, you solve a trigonometric
equation or a system of trigonometric equations the same way you solve an
equation or a system of equations, which I explain earlier in this chapter in
the sections “Solving a single equation or inequality” and “Solving a system of
equations.” But interpreting the answers the calculator gives for the solu-
tions is a bit different, as seen on the second line in each of these pictures.
The calculator uses the notation @n1, @n2, and so on, to denote an arbitrary
integer. For example, the notation 
@n
2 :
: r in the second line of the first pic-
ture in Figure 3-8 is the calculator’s way of saying “2nπ where n is an arbitrary
integer.” If the calculator needs to tell you that the arbitrary integer used in
one expression isn’t the same as that used in another expression, it places a
different number after @n, as illustrated in the second picture in Figure 3-8.
If you’re interested in finding only the solutions to a trigonometric equation
that fall in a specified range, the preceding section, “Finding particular solu-
tions to equations,” tells you how to do this. For example, the last two entries
in the first picture of Figure 3-8 illustrate the solution to the equation sinθ = 1/2
when 0 < θ < π.

Chapter 3: Solving Equations, Factoring, and Other Great Stuff

Finding complex solutions
Independent of the Mode setting of the calculator (which I explain in Chap-
ter 1), you need a special command, cSolve, to find the real and complex
solutions to an equation or system of equations. 
To find the real and complex solutions to an equation, follow the steps in the
section in this chapter titled “Solving a single equation or inequality,” replac-
ing Step 2 with “Press „CCB¨” to invoke the cSolve command instead of
the solve command, as illustrated in the first two lines in the third picture in
Figure 3-8. 
To find these real and complex solutions to a system of equations, follow the
steps in the section “Solving a system of equations,” replacing Step 2 with
“Press „CCB¨” to invoke the cSolve command instead of the solve com-
mand, as illustrated in the last two lines in the third picture in Figure 3-8.
Dealing with Polynomials
Do you need to find the quotient and remainder when dividing polynomials?
Or maybe you need to find the partial fraction decomposition of a rational
expression? Perhaps you simply need to add, subtract, multiply, or factor
polynomials? Whatever the task is, this section tells you how to accomplish it.
Adding and subtracting 
rational expressions
The comDenom command combines rational expressions of polynomials into
one rational expression, as illustrated in the first two pictures in Figure 3-9.
To use this command on the Home screen, press 2{, enter the combina-
tion of rational expressions, press d to close the parentheses, and then press
¸ to display the answer.
Figure 3-9:
Adding,

Part II: Doing Algebra and Trigonometry 

Dividing polynomials
The propFrac command is used to find the quotient and remainder when
dividing polynomials. To use this command on the Home screen, press „m,
enter the division problem in the form dividend/divisor, press d to close the
parentheses, and then press ¸ to display the answer. The answer is dis-
played in the form remainder/divisor + quotient, as illustrated in the third
picture in Figure 3-9.
Multiplying polynomials
The expand command is used to expand a product of polynomials, as illus-
trated in the first entry in the first picture in Figure 3-10. To use this com-
mand on the Home screen, press „ª, enter the product of polynomials,
press d to close the parentheses, and then press ¸ to expand the
expression.
Factoring polynomials
On the Home screen, you use the factor command to find the real factors of a
polynomial, and you use the cFactor command to find both the real and the
complex factors, as illustrated in the first two pictures in Figure 3-10. To use
these commands on the Home screen, follow these steps:
1. If you’re interested only in the real factors of a polynomial, press
„© to place the factor command on the command line. If you want
to see all real and complex factors, press „CCB© to select the
cFactor command from the Algebra Complex menu.
2. Enter the polynomial to be factored.

3. If you are not interested in seeing the irrational factors, skip this step;
otherwise, press b and enter the variable used in expressing the 
polynomial.
The last entry in the first picture in Figure 3-10 illustrates how this step
is used to find the irrational factors of a polynomial. The entries in the
second picture in this figure show examples where this step was skipped
so that the irrational factors would not be displayed. 
4. Press d to close the parentheses, and then press ¸ to factor the
polynomial.
Finding partial fraction decompositions
The expand command can be used to find the partial fraction decomposition
of a rational expression having polynomials in the numerator and the denom-
inator, as illustrated in the third picture in Figure 3-10. To use this command
on the Home screen, press „ª, enter the rational expression, press d to
close the parentheses, and then press ¸ to display the partial fraction
decomposition of the expression.
Doing Trigonometry
This section tells you how to convert an angle measurement to degrees, radi-
ans, and DMS (degrees, minutes, and seconds). It also tells you how to get the
calculator to simplify trigonometric expression. You even find out how to get
the calculator to tell you those trigonometric formulas you’ve forgotten.
Converting angle units of measurement
The next section tells you how to enter an angle and its unit of measurement
into the calculator, and the three sections after that tell you how to convert
that measurement to radians, degrees, or DMS (degrees, minutes, and 
seconds).
Entering an angle and its unit of measurement
To enter an angle in DMS (degrees, minutes, and seconds), first enter the
number of degrees and press 2Í to insert the degree symbol. Then enter
the number of minutes and press 2Á to insert the minute symbol. Finally,
enter the number of seconds and press 2¨ to insert the second symbol.
This process is illustrated on the command line of the second picture in
Figure 3-11.
52
Part II: Doing Algebra and Trigonometry 

Whether you enter a degree or radian angle in the calculator depends on the
Angle mode (radians or degrees) of the calculator. This mode is displayed at
the bottom of the screen. DEG on this bottom line indicates that the calcula-
tor is in Degree mode, as in the first picture in Figure 3-11. A calculator in
Radian mode displays RAD at the bottom of the screen, as in the second pic-
ture in Figure 3-11. (You find out about setting the Angle mode in Chapter 1.)
If the unit of measurement of the angle you want to enter agrees with the
Angle mode of the calculator, simply enter the numeric value of the angle. For
example, you enter 3.72 degrees on a calculator in DEG mode as simply 3.72,
as illustrated in the first entry in the first picture in Figure 3-11, where the cal-
culator supplied the parentheses. On a calculator in RAD mode, you enter
π/16 radians as π/16, as illustrated in the second entry in the second picture
in Figure 3-11, where the calculator supplied the parentheses. 
If the unit of measurement of the angle you want to enter does not agree with
the Angle mode of the calculator, the numeric value of the angle must be fol-
lowed by the appropriate symbol for the unit of measurement. You enter the
degree symbol by pressing 2Í, and you enter the radian symbol by press-
ing 2z©©. If the numeric value of the angle contains an arithmetic opera-
tion, you must first enclose this expression in parentheses before entering
the unit of measurement of the angle. For example, on a calculator in Degree
mode, you enter π/16 radians by pressing c2Ze¨{d to enclose the
numeric value π/16 in parentheses and then press 2z©© to indicate that
the angle is measured in radians, as illustrated in the second entry in the first
picture in Figure 3-11, where the calculator then enclosed the result in paren-
theses. On a calculator in Radian mode, you enter 3.72 degrees by entering
the numeric value 3.72 and then pressing 2Í to indicate that the angle is in
degrees, as illustrated in the first entry in the second picture in Figure 3-11,
where the calculator then enclosed the result in parentheses.
Converting an angle to DMS (degrees, minutes, and seconds)
To convert an angle to degrees, minutes, and seconds (DMS), press " if
you aren’t already on the Home screen and then enter the angle to be con-
verted. (I explain how to enter the angle in the preceding section.) Then
press 2z©n to select the DMS command from the MATH Angle menu.
Finally, press ¸ to convert the angle to degrees, minutes, and seconds, as
illustrated in the first two entries in each picture in Figure 3-11.

Chapter 3: Solving Equations, Factoring, and Other Great Stuff

When you’re converting an angle to degrees, minutes, and seconds and the
calculator is in Radian mode, the calculator might give you a result contain-
ing 60 seconds. Of course, we know that this should be expressed as 1
minute, but the calculator doesn’t know that. For example, in Radian mode,
the calculator converts 0.5 degrees to 29 minutes and 60 seconds; but in
Degree mode, it converts it to 30 minutes. Why does it do this? Beats me!
Converting an angle to degrees
On the Home screen, follow these steps to convert to degrees an angle mea-
sured in DMS (degrees, minutes, and seconds) or in radians:
1. Enter the angle to be converted.
You find out how to enter the angle earlier in this chapter, in the section
“Entering an angle and its unit of measurement.”
2. If your calculator is in Degree mode, skip this step. If your calculator
is in Radian mode, press 2z©o to select the DD command from
the MATH Angle menu, as illustrated on the command line in the
second picture in Figure 3-11.
3. Press ¸ to have the calculator find, if possible, the exact degree
measure of the angle, or press ¥¸ to approximate this value, as
illustrated in the last entry of the second picture in Figure 3-11.
Converting an angle to radians
On the Home screen, follow these steps to convert an angle to radians:
1. Enter the angle to be converted.
I explain how to enter the angle earlier in this chapter in the section
“Entering an angle and its unit of measurement.”
2. If your calculator is in Radian mode, skip this step. If your calculator
is in Degree mode, multiply the entry from Step 1 by π/180, as illus-
trated on the command line in the first picture in Figure 3-11.
Because the calculator doesn’t have a special command for converting
degrees to radians when in Degree mode, you have no choice but to con-
vert units by using the fact that 1 degree = π/180 radians.
3. Press ¸ to have the calculator find, if possible, the exact radian
measure of the angle, as illustrated in the last entry of the first picture
in Figure 3-11, or press ¥¸ to approximate this value.
Dealing with trigonometric expressions
The calculator has two commands, tExpand and tCollect, that are somewhat
useful when simplifying trigonometric expressions and even more useful if
you’ve forgotten a trig formula, such as one of the half-angle formulas. You
54
Part II: Doing Algebra and Trigonometry 

use the tExpand command with trigonometric functions whose arguments
consists of sums, differences, or integer multiples of angles, such as those in
Figure 3-12. It converts such a function into a combination of the sine and
cosine functions, each being a function of a single angle. To use this com-
mand on the Home screen, press „CCCB¨ to place the tExpand com-
mand on the command line, enter the trigonometric function, press d to
close the parentheses, and then press ¸ to expand the expression, as
illustrated in Figure 3-12.
You use the tCollect command with products and integer powers of trigono-
metric functions, such as those in Figure 3-13. It converts such expressions
into a combination of the sine and cosine functions in which the argument of
each of these functions is a sum, difference, or integer multiple of angles. To
use this command on the Home screen, press 2CCCB© to place the
tCollect command on the command line, enter the trigonometric expression,
press d to close the parentheses, and then press ¸ to simplify the
expression, as illustrated in Figure 3-13.
Have you forgotten a trigonometric formula? No problem. As the last two pic-
tures in Figure 3-12 show, you can use the tExpand command to give you a
cofunction, reduction, sum and difference, or double-angle formula. And the
last two pictures in Figure 3-13 show that you can use the tCollect command
to display a power-reducing or product-to-sum formula. But be warned, all
these formulas generated by the calculator are given in terms of the sine and
cosine functions, so, for example, the double-angle formula for tangent won’t
be expressed on the calculator the way it is in textbooks. However, the for-
mula given by the calculator is mathematically equivalent to the double-angle
formula for tangent found in a textbook.

Dealing with an out-of-date OS
In an ideal world, all calculators have the cur-
rent version of the operating system (OS). If you
have the cable that links your calculator to a
computer, see Chapter 21 for details on how to
download the free upgrade of the operating
system by using the free TI Connect software.
If your OS is out of date, your TI-89 might not, for
example, have the MATH Trig menu. To check it
out, press 2zC. If you see A: Trig on this
menu, your calculator has the MATH Trig menu.
If you see A: Calculus, your calculator doesn’t
contain the MATH Trig menu and your OS is out
of date.
What do you do if your calculator’s OS is out of
date? Well, the best thing to do is to upgrade
your OS. Even if you don’t have the cable that
links your calculator to a computer, you can
always link your calculator to another calcula-
tor of the same kind that does have the current
version of the OS. The cable that links these cal-
culators came with the calculator, and Chapter
22 tells you how to upgrade your TI-89 by using
an already upgraded TI-89.
And what do you do if you have no means of
upgrading the OS on an older TI-89 that doesn’t
have the MATH Trig menu? Well, if you want to
use the secant, cosecant, and cotangent func-
tions and their inverses, you can use the fol-
lowing conversions: 
 sec(x) = 1/cos(x)
 csc(x) = 1/sin(x)
 cot(x) = 1/tan(x)
 sec-1(x) = cos(1/x)
 csc-1(x) = sin(1/x)
 cot-1(x) = tan(1/x)

o you know how to enter a complex number into the calculator? Do you
know how to display solutions to arithmetic combinations of complex
numbers in polar form? Do you know how to find the modulus of an arith-
metic combination of complex numbers? If not, this chapter tells you how to
accomplish these tasks.
Doing Arithmetic with Complex Numbers
Where’s the i key? If you don’t know, this section is for you. It tells you how to
enter and display complex numbers and how to do arithmetic with complex
numbers.
Displaying complex numbers
Before doing arithmetic with complex numbers, you should decide whether
you want answers displayed in rectangular (a + bi) or polar (reiθ) form. The
first two pictures in Figure 4-1 show answers displayed in rectangular form;
the third picture displays answers in polar form.
When the calculator is in Real or Rectangular mode, the calculator displays
complex numbers in rectangular form (a + bi); in Polar mode, you see them
in polar form (reiθ). To change the Mode setting, press 3DDDDDB to dis-
play the Complex Format options in the Mode menu, press the number of the
option you want, and then press ¸ to save the settings in the Mode menu.
See Chapter 11 for information on how to convert between the rectangular
and polar forms of a complex number.

Entering and storing complex numbers
A complex number is entered in the calculator in the form a + bi. You enter
the complex number i by pressing 2½. For example, you enter the
complex number 1 + yi in the calculator by pressing ¨«Ú2½.
A complex number that you plan to use several times can be stored in the
memory of the calculator. I explain how to do this in detail in Chapter 2. As
an example, to store the complex number 1 + i in the variable named c, press
¨«2½ to enter the number, and then press §Éd¸ to
store it in c. In the future, you can place this complex number in an expres-
sion simply by pressing Éd to enter the letter c.
Entities stored under one-letter names can cause problems down the road if
you forget you stored them. For example, if you store 1 + i in the variable c and
then evaluate the expression x + c, the calculator replaces c with 1 + i. To avoid
such problems, when you finish using stored entities, press 2ƒ¨¸ to
erase all entities stored in one-letter names. Pressing 2ƒ©¸ instead of
2ƒ¨¸ erases the screen as well as the entities.
If you want to enter the conjugate, the real or imaginary part, or the modulus
of a complex expression into your expression, the section in this chapter
titled “Finding the conjugate, the real and imaginary parts, and the modulus”
tells you how to do it. Simply follow the five steps in this section without
pressing ¸ at the end of the last step.
Performing arithmetic operations
You perform arithmetic operations on complex numbers the same way you
do them with real numbers, which I explain in detail in Chapter 2. Figure 4-1
illustrates various arithmetic operations performed on complex numbers.
There is an exception: when attempting to find the nth roots of a complex
number, the calculator finds only one of the n roots, as illustrated in the
second picture in this figure.

To find the conjugate, real part, imaginary part, or modulus (absolute value)
of an algebraic expression involving complex numbers, follow these steps:
1. If you aren’t already on the Home screen, press ".
" is the fourth key from the top in the left column of keys.
2. Press 2zz to display the MATH Complex menu, as illustrated in
the first picture in Figure 4-2.
3. Press ¨ to find the conjugate, © to find the real part, ª to find the
imaginary part, or z to find the modulus (absolute value).
The calculator places the selected command on the command line and
provides the first parenthesis that encloses the expression entered next.
4. Enter the algebraic expression involving complex numbers.
5. Press d to close the parentheses of the command, and then press
¸ to execute the command, as illustrated in the second picture in
Figure 4-2.

T
he calculator has a variety of features that help you painlessly graph a func-
tion of one variable. The first step is to enter the function into the calcula-
tor. Then, to graph the function, you set the viewing window and press ¥…. Or
(better yet) you can use one of several Zoom commands to get the calculator to
set the viewing window for you. Finally, after you graph the function, you can
use Zoom commands to change the look of the graph. For example, you can
zoom in or zoom out on a graph the same way that a zoom lens on a camera
lets you zoom in or out on the subject of the picture you’re about to take. This
chapter tells you the ins and outs of graphing functions on the calculator.
Entering Functions
Before you can graph a function, you must enter it into the calculator. The
calculator can save up to 99 functions, y1 through y99. To enter functions in
the calculator, perform the following steps:
1. If necessary, press 3 and put the calculator in Function mode, as
shown in Figure 5-1.
If you see FUNC on the last line of the screen, you don’t need to do any-
thing in this step because the calculator is already in Function mode. If
you don’t see the word FUNC, press 3.

After pressing 3, the current Graph style in the Mode menu is high-
lighted and flashing. If this style is not the Function style, press B¨ to
set the Graph style to Function. Then press ¸ to save the new Graph
style. (For more about the other items on the Mode menu, shuffle over
to Chapter 1.)
2. Press ¥ƒ to access the Y= editor.
3. Enter the definitions of your functions.
To erase an entry that appears after yn, use the CD keys to place the
cursor to the right of the equal sign and then press M. To clear all
functions defined in the Y= editor, press ƒn¸.
To enter or edit the definition of a function in yn, use the CD keys to
place the cursor to the right of the equal sign and press ¸ or … to
place the cursor on the command line. Then enter or edit the definition
of the function and press ¸ when finished.
When you’re defining functions, the only symbol the calculator allows for the
independent variable is the letter x. Press Ù to enter this letter in the defini-
tion of your function. In Figure 5-2, I used this key to enter the functions y1, y2,
y4, y5, y6 and y7.
As a timesaver, when entering functions in the Y= editor, you can reference
another function in its definition provided that function is entered in the form
yn(x). The first picture in Figure 5-2 shows function y3 defined as –y2, where
you enter y2 by pressing Ú©.

Part III: Graphing and Analyzing Functions 

Graphing Functions
Here’s where your calculator draws pretty pictures. After you enter the func-
tions, as I describe in the preceding section, you can use the following steps
to graph the functions:
1. Turn off any Stat Plots that you don’t want to appear in the graph of
your functions.
The first line in the Y= editor tells you the graphing status of the Stat
Plots. (I discuss Stat Plots in Chapter 20.) If, as in the first picture in
Figure 5-2, no number appears after PLOTS on the very first line of the
Y= editor, then no Stat Plots are selected to be graphed, even if a
number appears on the second line after Plot. (If you haven’t instructed
the calculator to create any stat plots, or if you’ve deleted them, the
word Plot doesn’t appear.) If one or more numbers do appear after
PLOTS, as in the second picture in Figure 5-2, those Stat Plots are
selected to be graphed along with the graph of your functions.
To prevent an individual Stat Plot from being graphed, use the CD keys
to place the cursor on that Stat Plot and press †. († toggles between
deactivating and activating a Stat Plot.) To prevent all Stat Plots from
being graphed, press ‡z.
2. Press ƒo to access the Graph Formats menu and select the formats
that you want for your graph.
To do this, use the CD keys to place the cursor on the desired format
and press B to display the options for that format. Then press the
number of the option you want. When you finish setting the various for-
mats for your graph, press ¸ to save your settings.
An explanation of the Graph Formats menu options follows:
• Coordinates: This format gives you a choice between having the
coordinates of the location of the cursor displayed at the bottom
of the graph screen in three ways. Select RECT to display (x, y) rec-
tangular coordinates of the cursor or select POLAR to show the (r,
θ) polar form. If, for some strange reason, you don’t want to see
the coordinates of the cursor, select OFF.
• Graph Order: Select SEQ to graph functions one at a time or
SIMUL to graph all functions at the same time. The SEQ option
completes the graph of one function before starting the graph of
the next function; the SIMUL option graphs the points for each
function corresponding to a given x-value and then moves on to
the next x-value to graph the next point for each function.
• Grid: If you select ON, grid points appear in the graph at the inter-
sections of the tick marks on the x- and y-axes (as illustrated in
Figure 5-3). If you select OFF, no grid points appear in the graph.
65
Chapter 5: Graphing Functions of One Variable

• Axes: If you want to see the x- and y-axes on your graph, select ON
(as illustrated in the first picture in Figure 5-3). If you don’t want to
see them, select OFF (as shown in the second picture in Figure 5-3).
• Leading Cursor: Select ON if you want to see the cursor as the
function is being graphed (as shown in the second picture in Figure
5-3); otherwise, select OFF to hide the leading cursor.
• Labels: If you want the x- and y-axes to be labeled (as in the first
picture in Figure 5-3), select ON. Because the location of the labels
isn’t ideal, selecting OFF is usually a wise choice.
3. Press ¥„ to access the Window editor.
4. After each of the window variables, enter a numerical value that is
appropriate for the functions you’re graphing. Press ¸ or D to
move to the next variable.
Figure 5-4 shows the Window editor when the calculator is in Function
mode. The items in this menu determine the viewing window for your
graph — in particular, how the x- and y-axes look on the screen. The fol-
lowing gives an explanation of the variables you must set in this editor:
• xmin and xmax: These are, respectively, the smallest and largest
values of x in view on the x-axis.
If you don’t know what values your graph will need for xmin and
xmax, press „{ to invoke the ZoomStd command. This com-
mand automatically graphs your functions in the Standard viewing
window; the settings for this window appear in Figure 5-4. You can
then, if necessary, use the other Zoom commands (see Chapter 6)
to get a better picture of your graph.

• xscl: This is the distance between tick marks on the x-axis. (Go
easy on the tick marks; using too many makes the axis look like a
railroad track. Twenty or fewer tick marks make for a nice-looking
axis.)
• ymin and ymax: These are, respectively, the smallest and largest
values of y that will be placed on the y-axis.
If you have assigned values to xmin and xmax but don’t know what
values to assign to ymin and ymax, press „CCC¸ to invoke
the ZoomFit command. This command uses the xmin and xmax
settings to determine the appropriate settings for ymin and ymax
and then automatically draws the graph. It doesn’t change the yscl
setting. (You must return to the Window editor, if necessary, to
adjust this setting yourself.)
• yscl: This is the distance between tick marks on the y-axis. (As
with the x-axis, too many tick marks makes the axis look like a rail-
road track. Fifteen or fewer tick marks make a nice y-axis.)
• xres: This setting determines the resolution of the graph. It can be
set to any of the integers 1 through 10. When xres is set equal to 1,
the calculator evaluates the function at each of the 158 pixels on
the x-axis and graphs the result. If xres is set equal to 10, the func-
tion is evaluated and graphed at every tenth pixel.
xres is usually set equal to 2. If you’re graphing a lot of functions,
the calculator might take a while to graph them at this resolution,
but if you change xres to a higher number, you might not get an
accurate graph. You see this in Figure 5-5, which shows the func-
tion y1 in Figure 5-2 graphed first using an xres of 1 and then using
an xres of 10.
If the calculator takes a long time to graph your functions and this
causes you to regret setting xres equal to 1 or 2, press ´ to termi-
nate the graphing process. You can then go back to the Window
editor and adjust the xres setting to a higher number.
5. Press 2… to graph the functions.

xres=10

Chapter 5: Graphing Functions of One Variable

Graphing Several Functions
If you’re graphing several functions at once, determining which graph each
function is responsible for isn’t easy. To help clear this up, the calculator
allows you to identify the graphs of functions by setting a different graph
style for each function. To do this, follow these steps:
1. Press ¥ƒ to access the Y= editor.
2. Use the CD keys to place the cursor on the definition of the function.
3. Press 2ƒ to display the Style menu and then press the number of
the desired style.
You have eight styles to choose from: 
• Line, Dot, Square, and Thick graph styles: Figure 5-6 shows these
styles in order from top to bottom. As you can see in the first pic-
ture, where xres is 2, it’s hard to distinguish between the Square
and Thick line styles, but you can easily identify four different
graphs. If you really want to distinguish between these two styles,
set xres to at least 4, as in the second picture in Figure 5-6.
• Path and Animated styles: The Path style uses a circle to indicate
a point as it’s being graphed (as illustrated in the first picture of
Figure 5-7). When the graph is complete, the circle disappears and
leaves the graph in Line style.
The Animated style also uses a circle to indicate a point as it’s
being graphed, but when the graph is complete, no graph appears
on the screen. For example, if this style is used, graphing y = –x2 + 9
looks like a movie of the path of a ball thrown in the air.
• Shading Above and Below the curve styles: The calculator has
four shading patterns: vertical lines, horizontal lines, negatively
sloping diagonal lines, and positively sloping diagonal lines. You
don’t get to select the shading pattern. If you’re graphing only one
function in this style, the calculator uses the vertical line pattern. If
xres=4
xres=2
Figure 5-6:
Line, Dot,
Square, and
Thick graph
styles.
68
Part III: Graphing and Analyzing Functions 

you’re graphing two functions, the first is graphed in the vertical
line pattern and the second in the horizontal line pattern. If you
graph three functions in this style, the third appears in the nega-
tively sloping diagonal lines pattern, and so on (as illustrated in
the second picture in Figure 5-7).
If you don’t want the calculator to graph a function in the Y= editor but you
might need this function at a later date, remove the check mark to the left of
the function. To do this from the Y= editor, use the CD keys to place the
cursor on the function and press †. († toggles between deactivating and
activating a function.) To prevent all functions from being graphed, press ‡ª.
Is Your Graph Accurate?
The calculator can do only what you tell it to do — which doesn’t always pro-
duce an accurate graph. The three main causes of inaccurate graphs are the
following:
 The graph is distorted by the size of the screen.
Because the calculator screen isn’t square, circles don’t look like circles
unless the viewing window is properly set. How do you properly set the
viewing window? No problem! Just graph the function, as I describe ear-
lier in this chapter in the section “Graphing Functions,” and then press
„z to invoke the ZoomSqr command. ZoomSqr readjusts the window
settings for you and graphs the function again in a viewing window in
which circles look like circles. Figure 5-8 illustrates this. (The circle
being drawn in each of these figures is the circle defined by y2 and y3,
as shown earlier in Figure 5-2.)
If your ZoomSqr graph leaves unwanted gaps around the x-axis, as in
the second picture in Figure 5-8, change the xres setting in the Window
menu to 1 to get the calculator to evaluate more points on the graph.
Then press ¥… to redraw the graph.
Shading style

Chapter 5: Graphing Functions of One Variable

 The viewing window is too small or too big.
If you don’t know what the graph should look like, after graphing it, you
should zoom out to see more of the graph or zoom in to see a smaller
portion of the graph. To do this, press „ª to zoom out or press „©
to zoom in.
Then use the ABCD keys to move the cursor to the point from which
you want to zoom out or in and press ¸. It’s just like using a camera.
The point you move the cursor to is the focal point.
After zooming in or out, you might have to adjust the window settings,
as I describe earlier in this chapter in the section “Graphing Functions.”
As an example, the images in Figure 5-9 show the progression of graph-
ing y1 from Figure 5-2. I first graphed this function in the Standard view-
ing window. Then I zoomed out from the point (0, 10). And finally, I
adjusted the window settings to get a better picture of the graph by
removing the white space in the second picture in this figure to produce
the third picture.
If you regret the change you made to a graph window and want to return
to the window you had before making this change, press „CCB¨ to
invoke the ZoomPrev command.

Part III: Graphing and Analyzing Functions 

 Vertical asymptotes might not be recognizable.
In all graph styles except Dot, Square, and Animate, the calculator
graphs one point, and then the next point, and connects those two
points with a line segment. This sometimes causes vertical asymptotes
to appear on the graph. The last graph in Figure 5-9 illustrates an exam-
ple of when a vertical asymptote is present. Don’t mistake this almost-
vertical line for a part of the graph. It’s not; it’s just a vertical asymptote.
In a different viewing window or with a high xres setting, the vertical
asymptote might not even appear. This is illustrated earlier in Figure 5-5,
where I graphed the same function in the same window but at different
resolutions.
If you want to ensure that vertical asymptotes don’t appear on your
graph, graph the function in the Dot or Square Graph style described in
the previous section. This is illustrated in Figure 5-10.
Piecewise-Defined Functions
Graphing a piecewise-defined function on the TI-89 is a bit like programming.
If you’re familiar with the When-Else programming format, you know what I’m
talking about; if not, rest assured that I explain how you use this format to
graph piecewise-defined functions. To graph a piecewise-defined function,
perform the following steps: 
1. Press ¥ƒ to access the Y= editor and turn off any functions you
don’t want graphed.
You do this by using the CD keys to highlight the function and then
pressing † to toggle between displaying and not displaying a check-
mark to the left of the function. The calculator graphs only the functions
with checkmarks.
2. Use the CD keys to place the cursor on the function in which you
want to enter your piecewise-defined function and press ¸ to
place the cursor on the command line.

A two-part piecewise-defined function, such as 
,
,
<
y
y

a
y

$

is defined by entering when(x < a, y1, y2). This When-Else statement,
when(x < a, y1, y2), tells the calculator that when x is less than a, it
should graph y1; otherwise, when x is not less than a, it should graph y2.
This is illustrated on the command line in the first picture in Figure 5-11,
where the When-Else statement defines the piecewise graph consisting
of the line y = –x when x is negative and the parabola y = x2 when x is
positive.
A piecewise-defined function that has more than two parts is defined by
using nested When-Else statements. For example, you use the nested
statement when(x < a, y1,when(x < b, y2, y3)) to define the function

Here’s how you enter the word when and the inequalities:
• To enter the word when: Press ½¶ to go to the section of
the CATALOG housing words beginning with W. If necessary, use
the CD keys to move the cursor to the when( item in the
CATALOG. Press ¸ to insert when( in the definition of your
function.
• To enter the inequalities: Press 2µ to enter less than (<) or
2¶ to enter greater than (>). When graphing, the calculator
doesn’t (for example) distinguish between less than and less than
or equal to.
4. Press ¸.
Notice that the way you enter the definition and the way the calculator
displays the definition aren’t the same, as illustrated in the first picture
of Figure 5-11. You enter the definition the way a programmer would, and
the calculator displays it the way a textbook would, except the calcula-
tor uses the word else to, for example, indicate the opposite of x < 0.
5. Graph the piecewise-defined function.
“Graphing Functions,” an earlier section of this chapter, explains how to
graph functions. An example graph of a piecewise-defined function
appears in the second picture in Figure 5-11. 
72
Part III: Graphing and Analyzing Functions 

If one or more of the functions in your piecewise-defined function is a trigono-
metric function, make sure the calculator is in Radian and not Degree mode.
Otherwise, your piecewise-defined function might look like a step function
instead of the graph you were expecting. The next section tells you how to
change the mode and how to graph trigonometric functions.
Graphing Trig Functions
The calculator has built-in features especially designed for graphing trigono-
metric functions. They produce graphs that look like graphs you see in text-
books, and when you trace these graphs, the x-coordinate of the tracing point
is always given as a fractional multiple of π. To use these features when
graphing trigonometric functions, follow these steps:
1. Put the calculator in Function and Radian modes.
If you see the words RAD and FUNC displayed on the last line of your cal-
culator (as in Figure 5-11), then you are already in the proper mode. If
you don’t see these words, press 3. Then press B¨ to put the calcu-
lator in Function mode and DDDB¨ to get Radian mode. Press ¸
to save your new Mode settings.
2. Enter your trigonometric functions into the Y= editor.
Entering functions in the Y= editor is explained earlier in the chapter.
3. Press „m to graph the function.
„m invokes the ZoomTrig command that graphs the function in a view-
ing window in which –79π/24 ≤x ≤79π/24 and –4 ≤y ≤4. It also sets the
tick marks on the x-axis to multiples of π/2.
When you trace a function graphed in a ZoomTrig window, the x-
coordinate of the trace cursor will be a multiple of π/24, although the 
x-coordinate displayed at the bottom of the screen will be a decimal
approximation of this value. (Tracing is explained in the next chapter.)

Chapter 5: Graphing Functions of One Variable

If you want to graph trigonometric functions in Degree mode, to get at least
one period of a sine or cosine function, you must set xmin to 0 and xmax to
360. This is why I say that it is a lot easier to graph trig functions in Radian
mode. I explain setting the Mode to degrees or radians in Chapter 1.
Viewing the Graph and the Y= Editor
on the Same Screen
If you’re planning to play around with the definition of a function you’re
graphing, it’s quite handy to have both the Y= editor and the graph on the
same screen. That way you can edit the definition of your function and see
the effect your editing has on your graph.
To do this, press 3„B© to split the screen horizontally, press DBy to
put the graph at the top of the screen, and then press DB© to put the Y=
editor at the bottom of the screen, as illustrated in the first picture in Figure
5-12. Finally, press ¸ to save the changes you just made. You now see a
screen similar to that in the second picture in Figure 5-12. 
The active screen is the one with the bold border, as illustrated in the second
picture in Figure 5-12, in which the Graph screen is active. You toggle
between these two screens by pressing 2O.
There’s no rule that says you have to have the graph at the top of the screen;
reverse the order if you so desire. And for that matter, maybe you’d rather
use the Home screen with your graph. If so, go ahead and select it as one of
the applications appearing in your split screen. You can even select the LEFT-
RIGHT mode to split the screen vertically, but this mode doesn’t leave much
room for editing functions or doing calculations on the Home screen. The ver-
tically split screen is best used for displaying a graph and its table of values,
a topic addressed in the next chapter.
If you’re in split screen mode and want to use an application other than the
two appearing in your split screen, just press the keys that activate that
application and it will replace the active window in your split screen. For
example, if the Graph screen is active and you want to do a calculation on the
Home screen, press " to replace the Graph screen with the Home screen.
When you are finished with the Home screen, press ¥… to make the Graph
screen active again.
To return to FULL screen mode without making changes in the Mode menu,
just press 2N. This automatically sets the Split Screen mode on Page 2 of
the Mode menu to FULL.

Part III: Graphing and Analyzing Functions 

Saving and Recalling a Graph
If you save your graph as a Graph Database, when you recall the graph at a
later time, the graph remains interactive. This means that you can, for example,
trace the graph and resize the viewing window because a Graph Database also
saves the Graph mode, Window, Format, and Y= editor settings. It does not,
however, always save the Split Screen settings (TOP-BOTTOM and LEFT-
RIGHT) entered on the second page of the Mode menu. This section explains
how to save, delete, and recall a graph in a Graph Database.
To save a Graph Database from the Graph screen (¥…), the Y= editor
(¥ƒ), or the Windows editor (¥„), perform the following steps:
1. Press ƒ© to invoke the Save Copy As command.
2. If GBD does not appear on the first line under Type, press B¨.
3. Press DB and select the folder in which you want to store the Graph
Database.
If you haven’t created a special folder, store it in the default (main) folder.
4. Press D and enter a name for your Graph Database and press ¸
to save the name.
The calculator is automatically in Alpha mode, so you can enter a name
without first pressing the É key. But be warned, the calculator will
accept no more than an eight-letter name. If you key in more than eight
letters, it just disregards those extra letters.
5. Press ¸ to save your Database.
To delete a Graph Database from your calculator, perform the following steps:
1. Press 2| to access the VAR-LINK menu.
2. Arrow down to highlight the name of the Database.
3. Press ƒ¸¸ to delete the Database.
4. Press N to exit this menu and return to the previous screen.

Chapter 5: Graphing Functions of One Variable

To recall a saved Graph Database from the Graph screen (¥…), the Y=
editor (¥ƒ), or the Windows editor (¥„), perform the following steps: 
1. Press ƒ¨ to invoke the Open command.
2. If GBD doesn’t appear on the first line under Type, press B¨.
3. Press DB and select the folder in which you stored the Graph
Database.
4. Press DB and select the name of your database and press ¸.
If you see only an arrow but no filename after Variable in the third line of
the Open menu, there are no saved Graph Databases on your calculator.
When you recall a Graph Database, the Mode, Window, Format, and Y=
editor settings in your calculator change to those saved in the Graph
Database. If you don’t want to lose the settings you have in the calcula-
tor, save them in another Graph Database before recalling your saved
Graph Database.

Exploring Functions
In This Chapter
 Using Zoom commands
 Tracing the graph of a function
 Constructing tables of functional values
 Creating and clearing user-defined tables
 Viewing graphs and tables on the same screen
T
he calculator has three very useful features that help you explore the
graph of a function: zooming, tracing, and creating tables of functional
values. Zooming allows you to quickly adjust the viewing window for the
graph so that you can get a better idea of the nature of the graph. Tracing
shows you the coordinates of the points that make up the graph. And creat-
ing a table — well, I’m sure you already know what that shows you. This
chapter explains how to use each of these features.
Using Zoom Commands
After you’ve entered your functions in the Y= editor (as I describe in Chapter
5), you can use Zoom commands to graph or to adjust the view of your previ-
ously drawn graph. From the Graph screen or Y= editor, press „ to see the
ten Zoom commands that you can use to graph or to adjust the view of an
already drawn graph — they’re labeled 1 through 9 and A. In the following
four sections, I explain how and when to use these Zoom commands. 
Zoom commands that help you
to graph or regraph a function
 ZoomStd: This command graphs your function in a preset viewing
window where –10 ≤x ≤10 and –10 ≤y ≤10. You access it by
pressing „{.

This is a nice Zoom command to use when you haven’t the slightest idea
what size viewing window to use for your function. After graphing the
function using ZoomStd, you can, if necessary, use the ZoomIn and
ZoomOut commands to get a better idea of the nature of the graph. I 
discuss how to use ZoomIn and ZoomOut later in this section.
 ZoomDec: This command graphs your function in a preset viewing
window where –7.9 ≤x ≤7.9 and –3.8 ≤y ≤3.8. You access it by
pressing „y.
When you trace a function graphed in a ZoomDec window, the x-coordi-
nate of the trace cursor is a multiple of 0.1. (I explain tracing later in the
chapter.)
 ZoomTrig: This command, which is most useful when graphing trigono-
metric functions, graphs your function in a preset viewing window
where –79π/24 ≤x ≤79π/24 and –4 ≤y ≤4 if your calculator is in Radian
mode or where –592.5 ≤x ≤592.5 and –4 ≤y ≤4 if your calculator is in
Degree mode. It also sets the tick marks on the x-axis to multiples of π/2
in Radian mode or to multiples of 90 in Degree mode. You access
ZoomTrig by pressing „m.
When you trace a function graphed in a ZoomTrig window, the x-coordi-
nate of the trace cursor will be a multiple of π/24 when your calculator is
in Radian mode or a multiple of 15 degrees when it’s in Degree mode.
Tracing is explained later in this chapter, in the section “Tracing a Graph.”
To use the ZoomTrig command, enter your function into the calculator
(as I describe in Chapter 5) and then press „m. The graph automati-
cally appears. 
Zoom commands that help you find
an appropriate viewing window
 ZoomFit: This is my favorite Zoom command. If you know how you want
to set the x-axis, ZoomFit automatically figures out the appropriate set-
tings for the y-axis.
To use ZoomFit, press ¥„ and enter the values you want for xmin,
xmax, and xscl. Then press „CCC¸ (or press „ÉÁ) to get
ZoomFit to figure out the y-settings and graph your function. ZoomFit
doesn’t figure out an appropriate setting for yscl, so if the y-axis looks
a little cluttered, you might want to go back to the Window editor and
adjust this value. You can find out more about the Window editor in
Chapter 5.
 ZoomData: If you’re graphing functions, this command is useless. But if
you’re graphing Stat Plots (as I explain in Chapter 20), this command
finds the appropriate viewing window for your plots. See Chapter 20 for
information on how this works.
78
Part III: Graphing and Analyzing Functions 

Zoom commands that readjust the
viewing window of your graph
 ZoomSqr: Because the calculator screen isn’t perfectly square, graphed
circles won’t look like real circles unless you properly set the viewing
window by using ZoomSqr. ZoomSqr readjusts the existing Window set-
tings for you and then regraphs the function in a viewing window in
which circles look like circles.
To use ZoomSqr, graph the function as I describe in Chapter 5 and then
press „z. The graph automatically appears.
 ZoomInt: This command is quite useful when you want the trace cursor
to trace your functions using integer values for the x-coordinate, such as
when graphing a function that defines a sequence. (I explain tracing in
the next section.) ZoomInt allows you to select a new center for your
window, and then it regraphs the function in a viewing window in which
the trace cursor displays integer values for the x-coordinate.
To use ZoomInt, graph the function as I describe in Chapter 5 and then
press „n. Use the ABCD keys to move the cursor to the spot on the
screen that will become the center of the new screen. Then press ¸.
The graph is redrawn centered at the cursor location.
Zoom commands that zoom 
in or out from your graph
 ZoomIn and ZoomOut: After the graph is drawn (as I describe in
Chapter 5), these commands allow you to zoom in on a portion of the
graph or to zoom out from the graph. They work very much like a zoom
lens on a camera. To use these commands, follow these steps:
1. Press „© to zoom in or press „ª to zoom out. 
2. Use the ABCD keys to move the cursor to the spot on the
screen from which you want to zoom in or zoom out. 
This spot becomes the center of the new viewing window.
3. Press ¸.
The calculator redraws the graph centered at the cursor location.
 ZoomBox: This command allows you to define a new viewing window
for a portion of your graph by enclosing it in a box, as illustrated in
Figure 6-1. The box becomes the new viewing window.
79
Chapter 6: Exploring Functions

To construct the box, follow these steps:
1. Press „¨ and use the ABCD keys to move the cursor to the
spot where you want one corner of the box to be located. 
2. Press ¸ to anchor that corner of the box. 
3. Use the ABCD keys to construct the rest of the box. 
When you press these keys, the calculator draws the sides of
the box. 
When you use ZoomBox, if you don’t like the size of the box, you
can use any of the ABCD keys to resize the box. If you don’t like
the location of the corner you anchored in Step 2, press N and
start over with Step 1. If you’re drawing a rather large box, to move
the cursor a large distance, press 2 and then press an appropri-
ate Arrow key.
4. Press ¸ when you finish drawing the box. 
The calculator then redraws the graph in the window defined by
your box (as shown in Figure 6-1).
When you use ZoomBox, ¸ is pressed only two times. The first
time you press it is to anchor a corner of the zoom box. The next
time you press ¸ is when you’re finished drawing the box, and
you’re ready to have the calculator redraw the graph.
Texas Instruments’ first graphing calculator didn’t have all the nice Zoom
commands possessed by its current line of graphing calculators. If you
owned one of these early calculators, you had to set the Window to get the
calculator to do what the current Zoom commands automatically do for you.
For example, if you wanted the x-coordinate of the cursor to move in incre-
ments of 0.1, you set xmin to –4.7 and xmax to +4.7 because the screen of the
calculator was 94 pixels wide. And each time you wanted to use this window
you had to reenter it in the Window editor because there was no way to save
the settings for later use. You don’t have these inconveniences with Texas
Instruments’ current graphing calculators.

Part III: Graphing and Analyzing Functions 

If you have a favorite or often-used viewing window, be sure to save it in the
calculator and then recall it for later use. To save a viewing window, first con-
struct the window in the Window editor (as I explain in Chapter 5). Then
press „CCB© to save the window settings. When you want to graph a
function in the Y= editor by using the saved viewing window, all you need to
do is press „CCBª and the graph appears in your saved window. You can
save only one viewing window at a time. If you save a new window, it over-
writes the previously saved window.
If you like creating your own viewing windows, you might find it helpful to
know that the screen on the TI-89 is 158 pixels wide and 76 pixels long.
Tracing a Graph
After you have graphed your function, as described in the previous chapter,
you can press … (Trace) and then use B and A to more closely investigate
the points that are on the graph of the function. 
If you use only the ABCD keys instead of … (Trace) to locate a point on a
graph, all you will get is an approximation of the location of that point. You
rarely get an actual point on the graph. So always use … (Trace) to identify
points on a graph.
The following list describes what you see, or don’t see, as you trace a graph:
 The number of the function: The number of the function in the Y=
editor that you’re tracing is displayed in the top-right corner of the
screen. For example, if you see the number 1, you’re tracing the first
graph (y1) in the Y= editor.
If you’ve graphed more than one function and you would like to trace a dif-
ferent function, press D or C. Each time you press D, the cursor jumps
to the next higher-numbered function in the graph. If the cursor is already
81
Chapter 6: Exploring Functions
Undoing a zoom
If you used a Zoom command to redraw a graph
and then want to undo what that command did
to the graph, follow these steps:
1. Press „CCB to access the Zoom
Memory menu.
2. Press ¨ to select ZoomPrev.
The graph is redrawn as it appeared in the pre-
vious viewing window.

on the highest-numbered function, pressing D sends the cursor back to
the lowest-number function in the graph. Pressing C cycles the cursor
through the graphed functions in the opposite order.
 The values of x and y: At the bottom of the screen, you see either the
coordinates that define the cursor location or nothing at all. If you do
see the coordinates, they appear in either rectangular (x, y) or polar 
(r, θ) form with, for example, the rectangular x-coordinate denoted by
“xc” or the polar r-coordinate denoted by “rc.”
If you don’t like what you see at the bottom of the screen, press
ƒC¸B and then press the number of the option you want. (The
OFF option displays nothing at the bottom of the screen.) Finally, press
¸ to save your new selection, and then press … to start tracing
your graph.
When you press … (Trace), the cursor is placed on the lowest-numbered
graph at the point having an x-coordinate that is approximately midway
between xmin and xmax. If the y-coordinate of the cursor location isn’t
between ymin and ymax, the cursor doesn’t appear on the screen.
The sidebar, “Panning in Function mode,” tells you how to correct this
situation.
Each time you press B, the cursor moves right to the next plotted point
on the graph, and you see the coordinates of that point at the bottom of
the screen (provided Coordinates in the Graph Formats menu is not set
to OFF). If you press A, the cursor moves left to the previously plotted
point. And if you press D or C to trace a different function, the tracing of
that function starts at the point on the graph that has the x-coordinate
displayed on-screen before you pressed this key.
When tracing a graph, you can press 2B or 2A to get the cursor to
move a greater distance between plotted points.
When tracing a graph, if the value of the x-coordinate appears at the
bottom of the screen but the value of the y-coordinate is blank, this
means that the function is undefined at the value of the x-coordinate.
Press M to terminate tracing the graph. This also removes the number
of the function and the coordinates of the cursor from the screen. But if you
press any Arrow key, the coordinates of the cursor location appear at the
bottom of the screen (provided Coordinates in the Graph Formats menu is
not set to OFF).
When you’re using Trace, if you want to start tracing your function at a spe-
cific value of the independent variable x, just key in that value and then press
¸. (The value you assign to x must be between xmin and xmax; if it’s not,
you get an error message.) After you press ¸, the trace cursor moves to
the point on the graph with the x-coordinate you just entered. If that point
isn’t on the portion of the graph appearing on the screen, the sidebar,
“Panning in Function mode,” tells you how to get the cursor and the graph in
the same viewing window.
82
Part III: Graphing and Analyzing Functions 

If the display of the coordinates of the cursor is interfering with your view of
the graph when you’re tracing the graph, create more space at the bottom of
the screen by pressing ¥„ and decreasing the value of ymin. Then press
¥… to redisplay and press … to continue tracing the graph. The coordi-
nates of the trace cursor will be in the same location as they were before you
edited the ymin setting in the Window editor.
Displaying Functions in a Table
After you enter the functions in the Y= editor (as I describe in Chapter 5), you
can have the calculator create one of three different types of tables of func-
tional values:
 An automatically generated table displaying the plotted points that
appear in the calculator’s graphs of the functions
 An automatically generated table that displays the points according to
an initial x-value and x-increment that you specify
 A user-defined table in which you enter the x-values of your choice and
the calculator determines the corresponding y-values
I discuss these tables in the sections that follow.
83
Chapter 6: Exploring Functions
Panning in Function mode
When you’re tracing a function and the cursor
hits the top or bottom of the screen, you still 
see the coordinates of the cursor location dis-
played at the bottom of the screen (provided
Coordinates in the Graph Formats menu is not
set to OFF), but you won’t see the cursor itself
on the screen because the viewing window is
too small. Press ¸ to get the calculator to
adjust the viewing window to a viewing window
that is centered about the cursor location. Then
press … to continue tracing the graph. If the
function you were tracing isn’t displayed at the
top of the screen, repeatedly press C until it is.
The trace cursor then appears in the middle of
the screen, and you can use A and B to con-
tinue tracing the graph.
When you’re tracing a function and the cursor
hits the left or right side of the screen, the cal-
culator automatically pans left or right. It also
appropriately adjusts the values assigned to
xmin and xmax in the Window editor, but it
doesn’t change the values of ymin and ymax. So
you might not see the cursor on the screen. If
this happens, follow the directions in the previ-
ous paragraph to see both the function and the
cursor on-screen.

Creating automatically generated tables
To create a table for which you specify the initial x-value and the value by
which x is incremented, perform the following steps. After the last step, I tell
you how to create an automatically generated table displaying the points
graphed by the calculator.
1. Place a checkmark to the left of the functions in the Y= editor that you
want to appear in the table; leave the other functions unchecked.
Only the functions in the Y= editor that have checkmarks to the left of
their names will appear in the table. To check or uncheck a function,
press ¥ƒ, use the CD keys to place the cursor on the function, and
then press † to toggle between checking and unchecking the function.
2. Press ¥† to access the Table Setup editor (shown in Figure 6-2).
3. Enter a number in tblStart and press D. Then enter a number in ∆tbl
and press D.
If Independent is the only item you see in the Table Setup editor, and if
the cursor is on ASK, press B¨ to change this setting to AUTO and then
press CCC to enter numbers in tblStart and ∆tbl.
tblStart is the first value of the independent variable x to appear in the
table, and ∆tbl is the increment for the independent variable x. The cal-
culator constructs the table by adding the value you assign to ∆tbl to
the previous x-value and calculating the corresponding y-values of the
function or functions. In Figure 6-2, tblStart is assigned the value 5 and
∆tbl the value –1 to produce the decreasing values in the x-column of
the table. 
Use the number keys to enter values in tblStart and ∆tbl. Press D after
making each entry.

and the

84
Part III: Graphing and Analyzing Functions 

4. Set Graph <–> Table to OFF, press D, and then set Independent to
AUTO (as shown in Figure 6-2).
You have two choices for the Graph <–> Table setting (OFF and ON) and
two for the Independent setting (AUTO and ASK). When Independent is
set to ASK, no matter what other settings appear in the Table Setup
menu, a user-generated table is created where you manually place
values in the x-column of the table and the calculator computes the cor-
responding y-values. (I explain dealing with user-generated tables in the
next section.)
When Independent is set to AUTO and Graph <–> Table is set to ON, a
table of the points plotted in the calculator’s graphs of the functions is
created. However, if Graph <–> Table is set to OFF, the calculator uses
the values in tblStart and ∆tbl to generate the table.
To change the Graph <ì> Table or Independent setting, use CD to
place the cursor on the existing setting, press B to display the options
for that setting, and press the number of the option you want.
5. Press ¸ to save the settings in the Table Setup editor.
6. Press ¥‡ to display the table.
The table appears on the screen, as illustrated in Figure 6-2. You find out
about navigating the table later in this chapter in the section “Displaying
hidden rows and columns.”
The word undef in a table means that that particular function is not
defined at the specified x-value. For example, in Figure 6-2, function y1 is
undefined when x = 5.
To create a table of the plotted points appearing in the calculator’s graphs of
the functions, follow Steps 1 and 2 in the preceding step list. If Independent
is the only item you see in the Table Setup editor, press B¨ to change this
setting to AUTO and then press CB©¸ to set Graph <–> Table to ON
and to save your settings. If you see all four items in this editor, press
DDB©DB¨¸ to set Graph <–> Table to ON, Independent to AUTO
and to save your settings. (With these settings, the calculator ignores the
other values in the Table Setup menu.) If necessary, press ¥‡ to display
the table, as shown in Figure 6-3.

Chapter 6: Exploring Functions

Creating a user-defined table
To create a user-defined table in which you enter the x-values and the calcu-
lator figures out the corresponding y-values, follow these steps:
1. Place a checkmark to the left of the functions in the Y= editor that you
want to appear in the table; leave the other functions unchecked.
Only those functions in the Y= editor that have checkmarks to the left of
their names will appear in the table. To check or uncheck a function,
press ¥ƒ, use the CD keys to place the cursor on the function, and
then press † to toggle between checking and unchecking the function.
2. Press ¥† to access the Table Setup editor.
3. Set Independent to ASK and press ¸. 
Independent is the last item in the menu. If it is already set to ASK,
press ¸ and go to the next step. If it is set to AUTO, press DDDB©
to set it to ASK and then press ¸ to save your settings.
4. If the calculator doesn’t automatically display the table for you, press
¥‡ to display it. If the table contains entries, press ƒn¸ to
clear the table.
You see a table without entries, as in the first picture in Figure 6-4.
5. Enter values for the independent variable x in the first column.
You must enter values consecutively; you cannot skip any cells in the
first column of the table. To make the first entry, press ¸, use the
number keys to enter a value, and then press ¸ after you finish. To
make entries after the first entry, press D¸, enter a value, and then
press ¸.
After you make each entry, the calculator automatically calculates the
corresponding y-values of the checked functions in the Y= editor, as
shown in the second picture of Figure 6-4.
Figure 6-4:
Generating
a user-
defined
table.
86
Part III: Graphing and Analyzing Functions 

Displaying hidden rows and columns
To display more rows in an automatically generated table, repeatedly press
C or D. If you have constructed a table for more than three functions,
repeatedly press B or A to navigate through the columns of the table.
Each time the calculator redisplays a table with a different set of rows, it also
automatically resets tblStart to the value of x appearing in the first row of the
newly displayed table. To return the table to its original state, press „ to
access the Table Setup editor and then change the value that the calculator
assigned to tblStart. Press ¸ to save the value you entered, and then
press ¸ again to return to the table.
While displaying a table of functional values, you can edit the definition of a
function without going back to the Y= editor. To do this, use the BA keys to
place the cursor in the column of the function you want to redefine and press
†. This places the definition of the function on the command line so that
you can edit the definition. (I cover editing expressions in Chapter 1.) When
you finish your editing, press ¸. The calculator automatically updates
the table and the edited definition of the function in the Y= editor.
Viewing the Table and the Graph
on the Same Screen
After you have graphed your functions and generated a table of functional
values, you can view the graph and the table on the same screen. To do so,
follow these steps:
1. Press 3„Bª to vertically divide the screen.
2. Press DBz to place the table in the left screen. Then press DBy to
place the graph in the right screen.
If you prefer to have the graph on the left and the table on the right, just
reverse the order of keystrokes in this step. 
3. Press ¸ to save your Mode settings.
You now see a screen similar to that in the first picture in Figure 6-5.
Notice that the right screen doesn’t contain the graph of the function.
This graph appears in the next step.
4. Press 2O to toggle between the left and right screens.
The right screen is no longer empty, as in the second picture in Figure 6-5.
87
Chapter 6: Exploring Functions

On a split screen, the screen with the bold border is the active screen, and
the commands for the application in that screen appear at the top of the
screen. For example, in the second picture in Figure 6-5, the Graph screen is
active. So if you press … while in this application, you can trace the func-
tions graphed on that screen. (See “Tracing a Graph,” earlier in this chapter.) 
To return to FULL screen mode without making changes in the Mode menu,
just press 2N. This automatically sets the Split Screen mode on Page 2 of
the Mode menu to FULL.

derivative of the function at a specified value of x, or you can evaluate a defi-
nite integral of the function. The calculator will even find the inflection points
on your graph and the equation of a tangent to the graph.
These options enable you to find, for example, the slope and equation of the
tangent to the graph of the function at a specified value of x or to find the
area between the graph and the x-axis. And if you have graphed two or more
functions, the calculator will tell you where they intersect. It will even find
the arc length of a curve. This chapter shows you how to do all these things.
Is the answer approximate or exact?
The routines used by the calculator to find all
the neat Graph Math menu options that you find
in this chapter are numerical routines. This
means that they find really good approximations
of what you want, but they don’t always find the
exact value. So if you’re a student, think twice
about the appropriateness of using one of these
calculations when answering a test question.
As an example, the last figure in this chapter
shows that the circumference of a semicircle 
of radius 5 is 15.708. That’s an approximate
answer; the exact answer is 5π.

Finding the Value of a Function
When you trace the graph of a function, the trace cursor doesn’t hit every
point on the graph. So tracing isn’t a reliable way of finding the value of a
function unless you tell the calculator the value of the independent variable
x. (You discover how to do this in Chapter 6 in the section on tracing a
graph.) The ‡ Graph Math menu, however, contains a command that 
evaluates a function at a specified x-value. To access and use this command,
perform the following steps:
1. Graph the functions in a viewing window that contains the specified
value of x.
Graphing functions and setting the viewing window are explained in
Chapter 5. To get a viewing window containing the specified value of x,
that value must be between xmin and xmax in the viewing window.
2. If necessary, set the Graph Formats menu to display coordinates in
rectangular (x, y) form.
To do this, press ƒC¸B¨¸.
3. Press ‡¨ to invoke the Value command in the Graph Math menu.
4. Enter the specified value of x.
When using the Value command to evaluate a function at a specified
value of x, that value you specify must be an x-value that appears on the
x-axis of the displayed graph — that is, it must be between xmin and
xmax in the Window editor (see Chapter 5). If it isn’t, you get an error
message.
Use the keypad to enter the value of x; if you make a mistake when enter-
ing your number, press M and reenter the number.
5. Press ¸.
After you press ¸, the number of the first checked function in the Y=
editor appears at the top of the screen, the cursor appears on the graph
of that function at the specified value of x, and the coordinates of the
cursor appear at the bottom of the screen. This is illustrated in the first
graph in Figure 7-1.
6. Repeatedly press C to see the value of the other graphed functions at
your specified value of x.
Each time you press C, the number of the function being evaluated
appears at the top of the screen and the coordinates of the cursor loca-
tion appear at the bottom of the screen. This is illustrated in the second
graph in Figure 7-1.

Part III: Graphing and Analyzing Functions 

After using the Value command to evaluate your functions at one value of x,
you can evaluate your functions at another value of x by keying in the new
value and pressing ¸. Press any function key (such as ¸ or B) after
evaluating a function to deactivate the Value command.
If you plan to evaluate functions at several specified values of x, consider con-
structing a user-defined table of functional values (as I explain in Chapter 6).
Finding the Zeros of a Function
The zeros of the function y = f(x) are the solutions to the equation f(x) = 0.
Because y = 0 at these solutions, these zeros (solutions) are really just the x-
coordinates of the x-intercepts of the graph of y = f(x). (An x-intercept is a
point where the graph crosses or touches the x-axis.) To find a zero of a func-
tion, perform the following steps:
1. Graph the function in a viewing window that contains the zeros of the
function.
I explain graphing a function and finding an appropriate viewing window
in Chapter 5. To get a viewing window containing a zero of the function,
that zero must be between xmin and xmax in the viewing window, and
the x-intercept at that zero must be visible on the graph.
2. If necessary, set the Graph Formats menu to display coordinates in
rectangular (x, y) form.
To do this, press ƒC¸B¨¸.
3. Press ‡© to invoke the Zero command in the Graph Math menu.
If the calculator instructions at the bottom of the screen interfere with
your view of the graph, create more space at the bottom of the screen
by pressing ¥„ and decreasing the value of ymin. Then press ¥… to
redraw the graph and press ‡© to invoke the Zero command.
4. If necessary, repeatedly press C until the number of the
appropriate function appears at the top of the screen.
Enter x; press ¸

5. Set the lower bound for the zero you want to find and press ¸.
The lower bound for the zero is simply any number that is less than the
zero. To set the lower bound, use the A and B keys to place the cursor
on the graph a little to the left of the zero (as illustrated in the first pic-
ture in Figure 7-2), and then press ¸. A Left Bound indicator appears
at the top of the screen (as illustrated by the triangle in the second pic-
ture in Figure 7-2) and you are prompted to enter an upper bound.
If you prefer, you can set the bound by keying in a number and then
pressing ¸.
6. Set the upper bound for the zero and press ¸.
As with the lower bound, the upper bound is any number that is a bit
larger than the zero. To set the upper bound, use the A and B keys to
place the cursor on the graph a little to the right of the zero (as illus-
trated in the second picture in Figure 7-2) and then press ¸. The
value of the zero automatically appears on the bottom of the screen, as
shown in the second picture in Figure 7-2. 
If more than one zero exists between the lower and upper bounds you specify
when using the Zero command, the calculator finds only the smallest zero
and does not warn you that more zeros might exist. To find the other zero, if
such a zero exists, use the Zero command again, but this time set the lower
bound to a number slightly larger than the first zero found by the calculator
and set the upper bound to the same number you used when finding the first
zero. For example, if the first zero found by the calculator is 0.1, set the lower
bound to 0.1000001. After using the Zero command a second time, the calcu-
lator either displays the value of another zero or it displays an error message
telling you that there are no more zeros in the interval defined by the new
lower and upper bounds. After getting the error message, press N or ü to
make it go away.
The calculator uses scientific notation to denote really large or small num-
bers. For example, –0.00000001 is displayed on the calculator as –1.E–8, and
0.000000005 is displayed as 5.E–9.

Part III: Graphing and Analyzing Functions 

Finding Min and Max
Finding the maximum or minimum point on a graph has many useful applica-
tions. For example, the maximum point on the graph of a profit function not
only tells you the maximum profit (the y-coordinate), it also tells you how
many items (the x-coordinate) the company must manufacture and sell to
achieve this profit. To find the minimum or maximum value of a function, 
perform the following steps:
1. Graph the function in a viewing window that displays the maximum
and minimum points you want to find.
See Chapter 5 for details on graphing a function and finding an appropri-
ate viewing window.
2. If necessary, set the Graph Formats menu to display coordinates in
rectangular (x, y) form.
To do this, press ƒC¸B¨¸.
3. Press ‡ª to find a minimum or press ‡y to find a maximum.
Do the calculator instructions at the bottom of the screen interfere with
your view of the graph? If so, create more space at the bottom of the
screen by pressing ¥„ and decreasing the value of ymin. When you’re
done, press ¥… to redraw the graph and then press ‡ª or ‡y to
find a minimum or maximum, respectively.
4. If necessary, repeatedly press C until the number of the appropriate
function appears at the top of the screen.
5. Set the lower bound for the minimum or maximum point and press
¸.
To do so, use the A and B keys to place the cursor on the graph a little
to the left of the point (as illustrated in the first picture in Figure 7-3 for
the maximum point) and then press ¸. A Left Bound indicator
appears at the top of the screen (as illustrated by the triangle in the
second picture in Figure 7-3), and you are prompted to enter an upper
bound.
If you prefer, you can set the bound by keying in a number and then
pressing ¸.
6. Set the upper bound for the minimum or maximum point and press
¸.
To do so, use the A and B keys to place the cursor on the graph a little to
the right of the point (as illustrated in the second picture in Figure 7-3),
and then press ¸. The coordinates of the minimum or maximum point
automatically appear at the bottom of the screen, as shown in the third
picture in Figure 7-3.

Chapter 7: Analyzing Functions

Finding Points of Intersection
Using the ABCD keys to locate the point of intersection of two graphs gives
you an approximation of that point, but this method rarely gives you the
actual point of intersection. To accurately find the coordinates of the point
where two functions intersect, perform the following steps:
1. Graph the functions in a viewing window that contains the point of
intersection of the functions.
For information on graphing a function and finding an appropriate view-
ing window, see Chapter 5.
2. If necessary, set the Graph Formats menu to display coordinates in
rectangular (x, y) form.
To do this, press ƒC¸B¨¸.
3. Press ‡z to select the Intersection option.
4. Select the first curve.
If the number of one of the intersecting functions doesn’t appear at the
top of the screen, repeatedly press C until it does, as illustrated in the
first picture in Figure 7-4. When the cursor is on one of the intersecting
functions, press ¸ to select it. The calculator places a small + sign
on the selected curve, as illustrated in the second picture in Figure 7-4.
5. Select the second curve.
If the calculator doesn’t automatically display the name of the second
intersecting function at the top of the screen, repeatedly press C until it
does, as illustrated in the second picture Figure 7-4. When the cursor is
on the second intersecting function, press ¸ to select it. The calcula-
tor places a small + sign on the curve you just selected.
6. Set the lower bound for the point of intersection and press ¸.
To do so, use the A and B keys to place the cursor on the graph a little
to the left of the point of intersection, as illustrated in the first picture in
Figure 7-5, and then press ¸. A Left Bound indicator appears at the
top of the screen (as illustrated by the triangle in the second picture in
Figure 7-5), and you are prompted to enter an upper bound.

Part III: Graphing and Analyzing Functions 

If you prefer, you can set the bound by keying in a number and then
pressing ¸.
7. Set the upper bound for the point of intersection and press ¸.
To do so, use the A and B keys to place the cursor on the graph a little
to the right of the point, as illustrated in the second picture in Figure 7-5,
and then press ¸. The coordinates of the point of intersection auto-
matically appear at the bottom of the screen, as shown in the third pic-
ture in Figure 7-5.
If more than one point of intersection exists between the lower and upper
bounds that you specify when using the Intersection command, the calcula-
tor finds only the point of intersection that has the smallest x-coordinate
and does not warn you that more points of intersection might exist. To find
another point of intersection, if such a point exists, use the Intersection
command again, but this time set the lower bound to a number slightly larger
than the x-coordinate of the first point of intersection found by the calculator,
and set the upper bound to the same number you used when finding the first
point of intersection. For example, if the x-coordinate of the first point of
intersection found by the calculator is 0.1, set the lower bound to 0.1000001.
After using the Intersection command a second time, the calculator either
displays the value of another point of intersection or it displays an error mes-
sage telling you that there are no more points of intersection in the interval
defined by the new lower and upper bounds. After getting the error message,
press N or ¸ to make it go away.

Chapter 7: Analyzing Functions

Finding the Slope of a Curve
From the calculator’s Home screen you can find the derivative of a function.
For example, you can get the calculator to tell you that the derivative of x2 is
2x. (I tell you how to do this Chapter 12.) But when you’re in a Graph screen,
the calculator uses a numerical routine to evaluate the derivative at a speci-
fied value of x. This numerical value of the derivative is the slope of the tan-
gent to the graph of the function at the specified x-value. It’s also called the
slope of the curve. To find the slope (derivative) of a function at a specified
value of x, perform the following steps:
1. Graph the function in a viewing window that displays the point at
which you want to find the slope.
Graphing a function and finding an appropriate viewing window are
explained in Chapter 5. 
2. If necessary, set the Graph Formats menu to display coordinates in
rectangular (x, y) form.
To do this, press ƒC¸B¨¸.
3. Press ‡{¨ to select the dy/dx option.
If the instructions that appear at the bottom of the screen interfere with
your view of the graph, create more space at the bottom of the screen by
pressing ¥„ and decreasing the value of ymin. When you’re finished,
press ¥… to redraw the graph, and then press ‡{¨ to reselect the
dy/dx option.
4. If necessary, repeatedly press C until the number of the appropriate
function appears at the top of the screen.
5. Enter the x-coordinate of the point where you want to find the slope
and then press ¸.
To do so, use the keypad to enter the value of x. As you use the keypad,
the x-coordinate of the cursor location is replaced by the number you
key in. (See the first picture in Figure 7-6.) If you make a mistake when
entering your number, press M and reenter the number.
After pressing ¸, the cursor moves to the point on the curve having
the specified x-coordinate and the slope of the curve at that point is dis-
played at the bottom of the screen, as in the second picture in Figure 7-6.
If you’re interested only in finding the slope of the function in a general
area of the function instead of at a specific value of x, don’t enter a value
for x. Instead, just use the A and B keys to move the cursor to the
desired location on the graph of the function and press ¸.

Part III: Graphing and Analyzing Functions 

Evaluating a Definite Integral
If f(x) is positive (above the x-axis) for a ≤x ≤b, the definite integral 
f
x dx
a
b# ^ h
gives the area between the curve and the x-axis for a ≤x ≤b; if f(x) is negative,
the definite integral equals negative the area between the curve and the x-axis.
If f(x) is both above and below the x-axis, the definite integral equals the area
above the x-axis minus the area below the x-axis (as in the second picture in
Figure 7-7). To evaluate the definite integral, perform the following steps:
1. Graph the function f(x) in a viewing window that contains the lower
limit a and the upper limit b.
See Chapter 5 for details on how to Graph a function and find an appro-
priate viewing window. To get a viewing window containing both the
upper and lower limits, these limits must be between xmin and xmax in
the viewing window.
2. If necessary, set the Graph Formats menu to display coordinates in
rectangular (x, y) form.
To do this, press ƒC¸B¨¸.
3. Press ‡m to select the

option in the Graph Math menu.
If the calculator instructions at the bottom of the screen interfere with

by pressing ¥„ and decreasing the value of ymin. Then press ¥… to
redraw the graph and then repeat Step 3.
4. If necessary, repeatedly press C until the number of the appropriate
function appears at the top of the screen.
5. Enter a value for the lower limit a and press ¸.
Use the keypad to enter the value. As you use the keypad, the 
x-coordinate of the cursor location is replaced by the number you key
in, as illustrated in the first picture in Figure 7-7, in which –1 is entered
Enter x

for the lower limit. If you make a mistake when entering your number,
press M and reenter the number. Press ¸ after keying in a value
for a. A triangular symbol appears at the top of the screen, marking the
lower limit of the integral, as in the first picture in Figure 7-7. You are
prompted to enter the upper limit.
You can also set the lower limit by using the A and B keys to move the
cursor to the appropriate point on the graph and then setting this limit
by pressing ¸.
6. Enter the value of the upper limit b and press ¸.
After pressing ¸, the value of the definite integral appears at the
bottom of the screen, and the area between the curve and the x-axis, for
a ≤x ≤b, is shaded, as illustrated in the third picture in Figure 7-7.
The shading of the graph produced by using the
f
x dx
# ^ h
option on the
Graph Math menu doesn’t automatically vanish when you use another Graph
Math menu option. To erase the shading, press † to redraw the graph with-
out the shading.
Finding Inflection Points
An inflection point is a point on the graph where the graph changes concavity.
For example, the point in the second picture in Figure 7-8 is the point at
which the function in this picture changes from concave down to concave up.
To find an inflection point, follow these steps:
1. Graph the function in a viewing window that displays the inflection
point you want to find.
You can find details on graphing a function and finding an appropriate
viewing window in Chapter 5. 
Enter the lower limit
Press ¸, then 
enter the upper limit
Press ¸

Part III: Graphing and Analyzing Functions 

The inflection points on the graph are the points where a wiggle in the
graph changes concavity. To have the calculator find these inflection
points, you must be able to eyeball the approximate location of where a
wiggle in the graph changes from concave up to concave down or vice
versa. If your graph has two closely spaced wiggles, it is very difficult to
spot the location where each inflection point begins. If this happens in
your graph, adjust the Window settings for xmin and xmax so that you
can get a better view of the approximate location where the wiggles
change concavity. I explain changing Window settings in Chapter 5.
2. If necessary, set the Graph Formats menu to display coordinates in
rectangular (x, y) form.
To do this, press ƒC¸B¨¸.
3. Press ‡n to invoke the Inflection command in the Graph Math
menu.
Are the calculator instructions at the bottom of the screen interfering
with your view of the graph? If so, create more space at the bottom of
the screen by pressing ¥„ and decreasing the value of ymin. Then
press ¥… to redraw the graph and press ‡n to reinstate the
Inflection command.
4. If necessary, repeatedly press C until the number of the appropriate
function appears at the top of the screen.
5. Set the lower bound for the inflection point and press ¸.
To do so, use the A and B keys to place the cursor on the graph a bit to
the left of where you suspect the inflection point is located. Be generous;
eyeballing inflection points isn’t easy. If in doubt, move the cursor a bit
more to the left. When you’re sure the inflection point is definitely to the
right of the cursor, press ¸ to set the lower bound. A Left Bound
indicator appears at the top of the screen (as illustrated by the triangle
in the first graph of Figure 7-8), and you are prompted to enter an upper
bound.
If you prefer, you can set the bound by keying in a number and then
pressing ¸.
6. Set the upper bound for the inflection point and press ¸.
To do so, use the A and B keys to place the cursor on the graph a little
to the right of the inflection point and then press ¸. The coordinates
of the inflection point automatically appear at the bottom of the screen,
and the cursor is placed on this point, as shown in the second graph in
Figure 7-8.

Chapter 7: Analyzing Functions

Finding the Distance between Two Points
The calculator has a neat feature that draws a line between two points (on
either the same or different graphs) and calculates the distance between
them. To use this feature, follow these steps:
1. Graph the functions in a viewing window that displays the two points
between which you want to find the distance.
Graphing a function and finding an appropriate viewing window are
explained in Chapter 5. 
2. If necessary, set the Graph Formats menu to display coordinates in
rectangular (x, y) form.
To do this, press ƒC¸B¨¸.
3. Press ‡o to select the Distance command from the Graph Math
menu.
Are the instructions at the bottom of the screen interfering with your
view of the graph? If so, create more space at the bottom of the screen
by pressing ¥„ and decreasing the value of ymin. When you’re fin-
ished, press ¥… to redraw the graph and then press ‡o to reinstate
the Distance command.
4. If necessary, repeatedly press C until the number of the function con-
taining the first point appears.
5. Enter the x coordinate of the first point and press ¸.
Use the keypad to enter the x-coordinate, as illustrated in the first pic-
ture in Figure 7-9. After you press ¸, the calculator might display an
x-coordinate that is close to, but not equal to, the one you entered. If
this happens, don’t worry about it — the x-coordinate you entered is
stored in the memory of the calculator, and the calculator uses this
stored value to compute the distance.

6. If the second point is on a different curve, repeatedly press C until
the number of the function containing the second point appears.
The cursor jumps to the point on the other curve that is directly above
or below the first point, and the calculator prompts you for the second
point, as illustrated in the second picture in Figure 7-9.
7. Enter the x-coordinate of the second point, as illustrated in the second
picture in Figure 7-9, and then press ¸.
After you press ¸, the calculator connects the two points with a line
and displays the distance between these points, as illustrated in the
third picture in Figure 7-9.
Finding the Equation of a Tangent Line
Not only can the calculator draw a tangent to a curve at a specified point, but
it can also tell you the equation of that tangent. To get the calculator to do
this, follow these steps:
1. Graph the function in a viewing window that displays the point of 
tangency.
I tell you how to graph a function and find an appropriate viewing
window in Chapter 5. 
2. If necessary, set the Graph Formats menu to display coordinates in
rectangular (x, y) form.
To do this, press ƒC¸B¨¸.
3. Press ‡CCC¸ to select the Tangent command from the Graph

in Figure 7-10. If you make a mistake, press M and reenter the number.
6. Press ¸ to construct the tangent.
The tangent appears on the graph with the cursor located at the point
of tangency. The equation of the tangent appears at the bottom of the

A tangent drawn by the Tangent command in the Graph Math menu doesn’t
automatically vanish when you use another Graph Math menu option or
when you trace the graph. To erase the tangent, press † to redraw the graph
without the tangent line.
Evaluating Arc Length
The Arc command in the Graph Math menu can find the length of a section
(arc) of a graphed curve when you specify the beginning and ending point of
the section. To get the calculator to find this length, follow these steps:
1. Graph the function in a viewing window displaying the part of the
curve you want to measure.
I explain graphing a function and finding an appropriate viewing window
in Chapter 5. 
2. If necessary, set the Graph Formats menu to display coordinates in

sequence is simply an ordered list of terms or numbers. The most
famous sequence is perhaps the Fibonacci sequence, {0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8,
13, . . .}, where the first two terms are given and each following term is found
by adding the previous two terms. The formula used to generate a sequence
is referred to by various names, including recurrence relation, recursive func-
tion, and iterative function. Texas Instruments calls these formulas sequence
functions, so I use this term as well.
Entering a Sequence
The calculator can accommodate up to 99 sequences. To avoid notational
confusion, I denote these sequences by u1 through u99; the calculator uses the
notation u1 through u99. For the sake of simplicity, I tell you how to enter the
sequence uk(n). However, what I state in this chapter and in Chapter 9 for
uk(n) also applies to the sequences u1(n), u2(n), and so on. To enter a
sequence into the calculator, follow these steps:
1. Press 3By to put the calculator in SEQUENCE mode (as shown in
Figure 8-1) and then press ¸ to save the Mode settings.
If your sequence deals with money, set Display Digits in the Mode menu
to FIX 2 (as shown in Figure 8-1) to make the calculator round all num-
bers to two decimal places. To do this, press 3 if you aren’t already
in the Mode menu and then press DDBª. Finally, press ¸ to save
the Mode settings.

2. Press ¥„, enter the definition of uk, and then press ¸ to store
the definition in the Y= editor.
To do this, use the C and D keys to place the cursor on uk and then
press ¸ to place the cursor on the command line, where you enter
the definition. Any previously entered definition is overwritten when
you type the new definition.
The letters u and n are entered in a sequence definition by pressing
É« and É{, respectively, and you enter the subscript by
pressing the appropriate number key. For example, to enter the term
u1(n – 1) press É«¨cÉ{|¨d. After entering the definition,
press ¸ to store it in the Y= editor. Examples of definitions of
sequences appear in the second picture in Figure 8-1.
The definition of a sequence can reference any previous terms of itself
or of another sequence, but it cannot reference a current term. For
example, u2(n) = u1(n – 1) + 5 is a valid sequence definition, but defining
u2(n) = u1(n) + 5 results in an error message.
3. If you’re graphing more than one sequence, give your sequence a
unique graphing style so you can identify it in a graph of multiple
sequences.
In Sequence mode, you have four style choices: Line, Dot, Square, and
Thick (line). To set the style of sequence uk, use the CD keys to high-
light the definition of uk and press 2ƒ to display the style menu. Then
press the number of the desired style.
In some windows, the Square style looks like a super thick line, thicker
than the Thick style.
4. Enter the initial value or values of the sequence in uik and then press
¸ to save the setting in the Y= editor.
uik is left blank, set equal to the first term in the sequence uk(n), or set
equal to several terms in uk(n). It depends on how all the sequences, u1
through u99, are defined in the Y= editor.

The following tells you what value to assign to uik and how it’s entered in
the calculator:
• uik can be left blank if no other sequence in the Y= editor, including
uk, references a previous term of uk in its definition. If uik has previ-
ously been assigned a value, you can leave it there because the cal-
culator doesn’t need (and won’t use) it. But if you really want to
leave it blank, use the CD keys to place the cursor on uik and
press M to get rid of that value.
• uik is set equal to the first term in the sequence uk(n) if any of the
sequences defined in the Y= editor use uk(n – 1) in their definitions
but none use any other previous term of uk, such as uk(n – 2) or
uk(n – 4). To set uik equal to the first term in the sequence uk(n),
use the CD keys to place the cursor on uik and press ¸ to
place the cursor on the command line. Use the keypad to enter
the initial value and then press ¸ to store that value in the 
Y= editor. As you enter this number, the calculator automatically
erases any previous value assigned to uik.
• uik is set equal to the first two terms in the sequence uk(n) if any of
the sequences in the Y= editor use uk(n – 2) in their definitions but
none use any other previous term of uk, such as uk(n – 3) or uk(n – 5).
Similarly, uik is set equal to the first three terms in the sequence
uk(n) if any of the sequences in the Y= editor use uk(n – 3) in their
definitions but none use any other previous term of uk, such as 
uk(n – 4) or uk (n – 6); and so on. And to complicate matters, these 
initial values must be entered in reverse order, separated by commas,
and surrounded by curly braces. For example, the format for enter-
ing three initial conditions is {uk(3), uk(2), uk(1)}. To enter multiple
initial values, use the CD keys to place the cursor on uik and press
¸ to place the cursor on the command line. Then enter the ini-
tial conditions in the specified format; the curly braces are entered
into the calculator by pressing 2c and 2d. When you’re fin-
ished entering multiple initial conditions, press ¸ to store them
in the Y= editor. Although the calculator requires that you enter mul-
tiple initial values separated by commas, the calculator removes
these commas after you press ¸. An example appears at the
bottom of the second picture in Figure 8-1 (shown previously).
In the example in the second picture in Figure 8-1, ui1 is left blank
because none of the defined sequences u1, u2, or u3 use any term of u1
in their definitions. ui2 is set equal to the first term in u2(n) because
sequence u2 used u2(n – 1) in its definition. In this example, ui2 is
assigned the value of 5. Because u1 uses u3(n – 3) in its definition, ui3
is set equal to the first three terms in u3, listed in reverse order.

Chapter 8: Graphing Sequences

Graphing Sequences
After you have entered the sequence functions into the calculator, as I
describe in the preceding section, you can use the following steps to graph
the sequences:
1. If necessary, press ¥ƒ to enter the Y= editor.
2. Press 2„ and set the Axes for the graph to TIME, WEB, or CUSTOM.
The following list explains how your graph is displayed in each format
and how you set the format.
• TIME: The Time format is the most common format for graphing
sequences because it graphs the sequences as a function of the
independent variable n by graphing the points (n, uk(n)) for each
sequence. To set the Axes format to the Time format, press ¥ƒ if
you are not already in the Y= editor and press 2„ if you haven’t
already displayed the Axes menu. Then press B¨¸ to set the
axes to the TIME format. 
• WEB: This format produces a web plot (also known as a cobweb
plot because of its shape) for a sequence uk(n). Use it when you
want to see whether uk(n) converges to an equilibrium point or just
veers off into space. It graphs the points (uk(n – 1), uk(n)) and the
110

A comment on setting initial values
The second picture in Figure 8-1 illustrates a sit-
uation in which you might want to — but don’t
have to — deviate from the requirements for
setting initial values. In this example, the calcu-
lator doesn’t know the value of the first three
terms of u1, nor can it evaluate them. After all,
u1(1) = u3(–2), u1(2) = u3(–1), and u1(3) = u3(0), but
the calculator is told to evaluate u3 only for n ≥
1 (as indicated by the nmin = 1 setting in the first
picture in Figure 8-2).
Luckily, the calculator doesn’t have to know
these terms. It just calculates u1(n) for n ≥4.
When you graph u1(n), or produce a table of the
values for u1(n), the first three terms of u1(n)
don’t appear, but the rest of the sequence does.
This is illustrated in Figure 8-2 (elsewhere in this
chapter), where the top graph doesn’t start at
the same place as the other graphs. If you can’t
live with the omission of these terms in the
graph or in the table, set ui1 equal to the first
three terms in u1(n), listed in reverse order.
In this example, u1(n) = u3(n – 3) + n = [2(n – 3) +
1] + n = 3n – 5. So evaluating the first three terms
of u1(n) isn’t that difficult. However, for more
complicated sequences, it might not be worth
your time to figure out the values of these terms.
After all, didn’t you get the calculator so you
wouldn’t have to do scads of math by hand? In
situations like this, I recommend just living with
the omission of the first three terms in the graph
and the table.

line y = x. Using the … (Trace) and B keys then shows you
whether the sequence is converging or diverging. I explain this
tracing process in Chapter 9.
In Web format, the calculator places two restrictions on how the
sequence uk(n) is defined. First, it requires that uk(n – 1) appear as
a variable in the definition of uk(n); second, it requires that uk(n – 1)
be the only variable used in this definition. Defining uk(n) as uk(n) =
uk(n – 1) + uk(n – 2) or as uk(n) = uk+1(n – 1) results in an error mes-
sage. And because uk(n) = uk(n – 1) + n uses the variable n in its 
definition, it too results in an error message when it’s used in the
Web format.
To set the Axes format to WEB, press ¥ƒ if you aren’t already in
the Y= editor, and press 2„ if you haven’t already displayed the
Axes menu. Then press B© to select the WEB option. If you want
to use Trace to build the web plot yourself, press DB¨; otherwise,
if you want the calculator to automatically build the web plot for
you, press DB©. Finally, press ¸ to save your settings.
• CUSTOM: Use this format to create phase plots when you want
to see how one sequence affects another sequence. The Custom
format graphs the points (u(n), v(n)) where you specify which
sequences u(n) and v(n) in the Y= editor are used as the x- and 
y-coordinates.
To set the Axes format to the Custom format, press ¥ƒ if you
aren’t already in the Y= editor and press 2„ if you haven’t
already displayed the Axes menu. Then press Bª to select the
CUSTOM option. Then press DB, use the CD keys to highlight
the sequence you want graphed on the x-axis, and press ¸.
Repeat this process to select the function you want graphed on the
y-axis. Finally, press ¸ to save your settings.
3. If necessary, turn off any sequences and Stat Plots that you don’t want
to appear in your graph.
If you don’t know what I mean here, press ¥ƒ to display the Y= editor.
If a checkmark appears to the left of a sequence in the Y= editor, that
sequence will be graphed. To prevent this from happening, use the CD
keys to highlight the definition of the sequence and then press † to
remove the checkmark, thus preventing the sequence from being
graphed. At a later time, when you do want to graph the sequence,
repeat this process to reinstate the checkmark.
When graphing a web plot, only the sequence used to create the plot
should have a checkmark next to it in the Y= editor. If another sequence
is checked and its definition doesn’t abide by the restrictions placed on
sequences that can be used to produce web plots (as specified in Step 2)
you get an error message. If the other sequence does abide by these
restrictions, it will graph, but its existence usually clutters the screen. 
111
Chapter 8: Graphing Sequences

The first line in the Y= editor tells you the graphing status of the Stat
Plots. (See Chapter 20 for more on Stat Plots.) If no number appears
after PLOTS on the very first line of the Y= editor, as in the second pic-
ture in Figure 8-1, no Stat Plots are selected to be graphed. If one or
more numbers do appear, those Stat Plots will be graphed along with
the graph of your sequences.
To prevent an individual Stat Plot from being graphed, use the CD keys
to place the cursor on that Stat Plot and press †. († toggles between
deactivating and activating a Stat Plot.) To prevent all Stat Plots from
being graphed, press ‡z.
When you’re graphing sequences, Stat Plots that are active when you
don’t really want them graphed cause problems that could result in an
error message when you attempt to graph your sequences. So if you
aren’t planning to graph a Stat Plot along with your sequences, make
sure all Stat Plots are turned off by pressing ‡z.
4. If necessary, set the format for the graph by pressing ƒC¸ and
changing the selections in the Graph Formats menu.
I explain the Graph Formats menu in Chapter 5. It allows you to have
coordinates of the cursor location displayed in rectangular (x, y) form,
polar (r, θ) form, or not displayed at all. So if you want to know the coor-
dinates of the cursor location, my recommendation is to display the
coordinates in either rectangular or polar form. 
The Grid option is your choice, either OFF or ON. And as far as the
other options go, my recommendation is to set Axes ON, Leading
Cursor OFF, and Labels OFF. Why? See Chapter 5.
5. Press ¥„ to access the Window editor. 
6. After each of the first four window variables, enter a numerical value
that is appropriate for the sequences you’re graphing, and press ¸
after entering each number.
Figure 8-2 pictures the Window editor when the calculator is in Sequence
mode. The following list explains the variables you must set in this
editor:
• nmin: This setting contains the first value of the independent vari-
able n for each of your sequences. For example, if you set nmin = 
5, the first number in the each sequence is uk(5). You usually want
to set nmin equal to 1 so your sequences look like {uk(1), uk(2),
uk(3), . . .}. But if your sequences represent an experiment that
starts at “time zero,” you want to set nmin equal to 0. This way
your sequences look like {uk(0), uk(1), uk(2), . . .}.
112
Part IV: Working with Sequences, Parametric Equations, and Polar Equations 

nmin must be set equal to 0 or to a positive integer. The calculator
isn’t equipped to handle negative values for nmin. Setting nmin
equal to something other than 0 or a positive integer results in an
error message.
• nmax: This setting contains the largest value of the independent
variable n that you want the calculator to use to evaluate your
sequences. For example, if nmin = 0 and nmax = 100, the calculator
will evaluate the first 101 terms in each sequence.
nmax must be set equal to a positive integer that is greater than
nmin. Be reasonable when entering a value for nmax. If you’re
graphing three sequences and nmax = 1,000, it’s going to take the
calculator at least a minute to get the job done.
If it’s taking a long time for the calculator to graph your sequences
and you start to regret that rather large value you placed in nmax,
press ´ to terminate the graphing process. You can then go back
to the Window editor and adjust the nmax setting.
• plotStrt: This setting tells the calculator where you want to start
graphing in each sequence. For example, if plotStrt = 20, the calcu-
lator starts the graph with the 20th term in each sequence.
This isn’t always intuitive. If nmin = 1, the 20th term in the sequence
uk(n) is uk(20). But if nmin = 0, the 20th term in this sequence is
uk(19).
plotStrt must be set equal to a positive integer. Usually it’s set
equal to 1 so that the graph starts at the beginning of a sequence.
• plotStep: This setting tells the calculator whether you want to skip
graphing any terms in each sequence. A setting of 1 tells the calcu-
lator to graph every term in each sequence; a setting of 2 tells it to
graph every other term; a setting of 3 tells it to graph every third
term; and so on. plotStep must be set equal to a positive integer.
Usually it’s set equal to 1 so that the graph shows all terms in your
sequences.
You use the remaining items in the Window editor to set a viewing
window for the graph (a procedure that I explain in detail in Chapter 5).
If you know the dimensions of the viewing window required for your
graph, go ahead and assign numerical values to the remaining variables
in the Window editor and advance to Step 10. If you don’t know the mini-
mum and maximum y values required for your graph, the next step tells
you how to get the calculator to find them for you.
113
Chapter 8: Graphing Sequences

7. If your calculator is in Web format, enter numerical values for xmin
and xmax.
If you’re graphing in the Time or Custom format, skip this step. If the cal-
culator is in Web format, set xmin equal to the value in nmin and xmax
equal to the value in nmax. After producing the graph (in Step 8), you
can adjust the window to your liking (in Step 9).
8. Press „CCC¸ to get ZoomFit to graph your sequences.
After you have assigned values to nmin, nmax, plotStrt, and plotStep
(and xmin and xmax when using the Web format), ZoomFit determines
appropriate values for xmin, xmax, ymin, and ymax and graphs your
sequences. ZoomFit graphs the sequences in the smallest possible view-
ing window, however, and it won’t assign appropriate values to xscl and
yscl. (See the second picture in Figure 8-2.) 
If you like the way the graph looks, you can skip the remaining steps. If
you’d like to spruce up the graph, Step 9 gives you some pointers.
9. Press ¥„ and adjust the values assigned to the x and y settings, and
press ¸ after entering each new number.
Here’s how to readjust the viewing window after using ZoomFit:
• xmin and xmax: If you want to see the y-axis on your graph, set
xmin equal to 0. If you’re interested in seeing a more detailed graph
of the beginning of the sequence, decrease the value of xmax.
• xscl: Set this equal to a value that doesn’t make the x-axis look like
railroad tracks — that is, an axis with far too many tick marks.
Twenty or fewer tick marks makes for a nice-looking axis.
• ymin and ymax: If you don’t want the graph to hit the top and
bottom of the screen, decrease the value assigned to ymin and
increase the value assigned to ymax. If you want to see the x-axis
on the graph, assign values to ymin and ymax so that zero is
strictly between these two values.
• yscl: Set this equal to a value that doesn’t make the x-axis look like
railroad tracks (too many tick marks). Fifteen or fewer tick marks
is a nice number for the y-axis.

10. Press ¥… to regraph the sequences.
If you get an error message when graphing sequences and then select
the GOTO option, the calculator sends you to the definition of the
“problem” sequence that you placed in the Y= editor. More often than
not, however, the true location of the problem is not in the way you
defined the sequence (as the calculator leads you to believe) but in the
way you defined the initial value uik or in the settings in the Axes menu.
For example, if u3(n) = u1(n – 2) + u2(n – 1) and the calculator places the
cursor after u1(n – 2) when you select the GOTO option, then the prob-
lem is most likely caused by not setting ui1 equal to the first two terms
in u1(n). (The previous section explains how to set uik.) Or the problem
could be caused by the Axes being set to Web format when you were
expecting to graph in Time format. (You change the Axes format in
Step 2.)
Saving a Sequence Graph
After you’ve graphed your sequences, you can save the graph and its entire
Window, Y= editor, Mode, and Format settings in a Graph Database. When
you recall the Database at a later time, you get more than just a picture of the
graph. The calculator also restores the Window, Y= editor, Mode, and Format
settings to those stored in the Database. Thus you can, for example, trace the
recalled graph. 
You can find the procedures for saving and recalling a Graph Database in
Chapter 5.

T
he calculator has three very useful features that help you explore the
graph of a sequence: zooming, tracing, and creating tables. Zooming
allows you to quickly adjust the viewing window for the graph so that you
can get a better idea of the nature of the graph of the sequence. Tracing
shows you the coordinates of the points that make up the graph. And creat-
ing a table — well, I’m sure you already know what that shows you. This
chapter explains how to use each of these features.
Exploring Sequence Graphs
When you explore the graph of a sequence, you’re usually interested in
seeing where the sequence goes. Does it level off and converge to a number?
Does it veer off into space? What does it look like from the 50th term on?
What’s the value of the 100th term? The calculator’s Zoom and Trace features
help you answer such questions.
Using Zoom commands in Sequence mode
After graphing your sequence, as I explain in Chapter 8, press „ to access
the Zoom menu. On this menu you see all the Zoom commands that are 
available for graphing functions. Not all of them are useful when graphing
sequences, however. Here are the ones that I use when graphing sequences
(see Chapter 8 for details on how to use these commands):

 ZoomFit: This command finds a viewing window for a specified portion
of the sequence. How to use ZoomFit is explained in Chapter 8 in the
section on graphing sequences.
 ZoomBox: After the calculator draws the graph, this command allows
you to define a new viewing window for a portion of your graph by
enclosing it in a box, as illustrated in Figure 9-1. The box becomes the
new viewing window. I explain how to use this command in Chapter 6 in
the section on zoom commands that zoom in or out from your graph.
 Zoom In and Zoom Out: After the calculator draws the graph, these
commands allow you to zoom in on a portion of the graph or to zoom
out from the graph. They work very much like a zoom lens on a camera.
(The section on zoom commands that zoom in or out in Chapter 6 gives
detailed instructions on how to use these commands.) 
Tracing a sequence
After you have graphed your sequences (as I describe in Chapter 8), you can
have the cursor display the coordinates of the points on the graph by tracing
the graph. To do this, press … and then use B to trace the graph. As you
investigate a sequence by tracing it, here’s what you see:
 The number of the sequence: In the Time and Web formats (which I
explain in Chapter 8), the number of the sequence in the Y= editor that
you’re tracing is displayed in the top-right corner of the screen. For
example, if you see the number 1, you’re tracing the first sequence (u1)
in the Y= editor. If you’ve graphed more than one sequence and you
would like to trace a different sequence, repeatedly press C until the
number of the desired sequence appears.
In the Custom format (which you also find out about in Chapter 8), no
sequence number appears on the screen because there is only one graph.
 The value of the independent variable n: At the bottom of the screen
you see a value for nc. This is the value of the independent variable n at
the cursor location. Each time you press B, the cursor moves to the next
plotted point in the graph and updates the value of nc. If you press A, the
Figure 9-1:
Using
ZoomBox.
118
Part IV: Working with Sequences, Parametric Equations, and Polar Equations 

cursor moves left to the previously plotted point in the sequence (pro-
vided you aren’t at the beginning of the graph). And if you press C to
trace a different sequence, the tracing of that sequence starts at the same
value of nc that was displayed on-screen before you pressed this key.
If no value for nc appears on the screen, press ƒCüB and then press ¨
to display coordinates in rectangular form or press © to display them on
polar form. When you’re finished, press ü to save your settings and then
press … to trace the graph. The value of nc now appears on the screen.
When you’re using Trace, if you want to start tracing your sequence at a
specific value of the independent variable n, just key in that value and
press ¸. (The value you assign to n cannot be greater than nmax; if
it is, you get an error message.) After you press ¸, the trace cursor
moves to the point on the graph corresponding to that value of n. But
the calculator does not change the viewing window. So if the value you
assigned to n is greater than xmax, you won’t see the cursor; it’s on the
part of the graph outside the viewing window. The sidebar “Panning in
Sequence mode” tells you how to get the cursor and the graph in the
same viewing window.
 The coordinates of the cursor: On the last line of the screen you see the
coordinates of the cursor location. The relationship between these coor-
dinates and the sequence depends on how you set the Axes format for
the sequence. (You discover how to set the Axes format in Chapter 8.)
Here’s what you see in the various formats:
• TIME format: When coordinates are displayed in rectangular form,
the x-coordinate of the cursor location is the independent variable
n and the y-coordinate is the corresponding value of the sequence
at n.
• WEB format: In this format, the trace cursor starts on the x-axis at
the first term in the sequence uk(n). When you press B, the cursor
moves vertically to the graph of the points (uk(n), uk(n + 1)). And
when you press B again, it moves horizontally to the line y = x.
Each time you press B after that, the cursor repeats this alternat-
ing vertical and horizontal movement. In addition, a vertical or
horizontal line connects all points traced by the cursor. This is
illustrated in Figure 9-2.
In Web format, if nmin = 1, the points traced by the trace cursor
are (uk(1), 0), (uk(1), uk(2)), (uk(2), uk(2)), (uk(2), uk(3)), (uk(3), uk(3)),
(uk(3), uk(4)), and so on. You use this format when you want to see
whether a sequence converges or diverges. Figure 9-2 shows an
example of using the Web format and Trace to investigate the con-
vergence of a sequence.
• CUSTOM format: When you defined this format (see Chapter 8)
you specified which sequences uk and ul in the Y= editor were to be
used as the x- and y-coordinates. Because this format graphs the
points (uk(n), ul(n)), xc = uk(nc) and yc = ul(nc).
119
Chapter 9: Exploring Sequences

Press N to terminate tracing the graph. This also removes the number of
the sequence and the coordinates of the cursor from the screen.
If the number of the sequence and the value of the independent variable n are
interfering with your view of the graph when you use Trace, increase the
height of the window by pressing ¥2 and decreasing the value of ymin and
increasing the value of ymax.
Displaying Sequences in a Table
After you’ve entered the sequences into the calculator (as I describe in
Chapter 8), you can have the calculator create one of two different types of
tables displaying the terms in your sequence; one is automatically generated
Figure 9-2:
Tracing a
convergent
sequence in
Web format.
120
Part IV: Working with Sequences, Parametric Equations, and Polar Equations 
Panning in Sequence mode
When you’re tracing a sequence and the cursor
hits an edge of the screen, if nc is less than
nmax and you continue to press B, the coordi-
nates of the cursor are displayed at the bottom
of the screen. However, because the calculator
doesn’t automatically adjust the viewing
window, you don’t see the cursor on the graph.
To rectify this situation, make a mental note of
the value of nc (or jot it down) and then press
¸. The calculator then redraws the graph
centered at the location of the cursor at the time
you pressed ¸. Then press … to continue
tracing the graph.
Unfortunately, after the graph is redrawn, the
trace cursor is placed at the beginning of the first
sequence appearing in the Y= editor. To get the
trace cursor back on the part of the graph dis-
played in the new viewing window, key in the
value of nc that you made note of, and then press
¸. If you weren’t tracing the first sequence
appearing in the Y= editor, use C to place the
cursor on the graph you were tracing. The trace
cursor then appears in the middle of the screen
and you can use B or A to continue tracing the
sequence. When nc equals nmax, pressing B
has no effect because the cursor has reached
the end of the sequence and can go no farther.

by the calculator and the other, the user-defined table, allows you to manu-
ally place a value of the independent variable in the table and have the calcu-
lator determine the value of the corresponding term in the sequence.
Creating automatically generated tables
You have some flexibility in the way the calculator displays sequence terms
in an automatically generated table. You can have it display every term start-
ing with the first term or starting with any term of your choice. And instead
of having the table display every term, you can have it display every other
term or every tenth term or any interval between terms that you want. To
create an automatically generated table, follow these steps:
1. Place a checkmark to the left of the sequences in the Y= editor that
you want to appear in the table; leave the other sequences unchecked.
Only the sequences in the Y= editor that have checkmarks to the left of
their names will appear in the table. To check or uncheck a sequence,
press ¥ƒ to access the Y= editor, use the CD keys to place the cursor
on the sequence, and then press † to toggle between checking or
unchecking the sequence.
2. Press ¥† to access the Table Setup editor (shown in Figure 9-3).
3. Enter a number in tblStart and press D; then enter a number in ∆tbl
and press D.
If Independent is the only item you see in the Table Setup editor and if
the cursor is on ASK, press B¨ to change this setting to AUTO and then
press CCC to enter numbers in tblStart and ∆tbl.
tblStart is the first value of the independent variable n to appear in the
first column of the table. It must be an integer greater than or equal to
nmin. ∆tbl is the increment for the independent variable n. The calcula-
tor constructs the table by adding the value you assign to ∆tbl to the
previous n-value and calculating the corresponding values of the terms
in the sequences displayed in the table. Usually ∆tbl is assigned the
value 1, so the table displays each term of the sequence. If you want to
see every other term in the sequence, assign it the value 2. To see every
tenth term, assign it the value 10, and so on.
Figure 9-3:
Generating
a table of
sequence
values.
121
Chapter 9: Exploring Sequences

In Figure 9-3, tblStart is assigned the value 2 and ∆tbl is assigned the
value 2 to display every other term in the sequences starting with the
second term.
Use the number keys to enter values in tblStart and ∆tbl. Press D after
making each entry.
4. If necessary, set Graph <–> Table to OFF (as shown in Figure 9-3).
You have two choices for the Graph <–> Table setting: OFF and ON.
When Graph <–> Table is set to ON, a table of the points plotted in the
calculator’s graphs of the sequences is created. However, if Graph <–>
Table is set to OFF, the calculator uses the values in tblStart and ∆tbl to
generate the table.
To change the Graph <–> Table setting, use CD to place the cursor on
the existing setting, press B to display the options for that setting, and
press the number of the option you want.
5. Press ¸ to save the settings in the Table Setup editor.
6. If necessary, press ¥‡ to display the table.
The table appears on the screen, as illustrated in Figure 9-3. You find out
about navigating the table later in this chapter.
The word undef in a table means that a particular sequence is not
defined at the specified n-value. For example, in Figure 9-3, sequence u1
is undefined when n = 2.
Creating a user-defined table
User-defined tables are quite handy when you want to know the values of
terms in a sequence that don’t necessarily appear in a specific order. For
example, you might want to know the value of uk(100). And based on that
value, you might decide that you need to know the value of uk(50). The value
of uk(50) might then inspire you to investigate the value of uk(75), and so on.
To create a user-defined table in which you enter the n-values and the calcu-
lator figures out the corresponding sequence values, follow these steps:
1. Place a checkmark to the left of each sequence in the Y= editor that
you want to appear in the table; leave the other sequences unchecked.
Only the sequences in the Y= editor that have checkmarks to the left of
their names will appear in the table. To check or uncheck a sequence,
press ¥ƒ, use the CD keys to place the cursor on the sequence, and
then press † to toggle between checking and unchecking the sequence.
2. Press ¥† to access the Table Setup editor.

Part IV: Working with Sequences, Parametric Equations, and Polar Equations 

3. Set Independent to ASK and press ¸.
Independent is the last item in the menu. If it is already set to ASK,
press ¸ and go to the next step. If Independent is set to AUTO,
press DDDB© to set it to ASK and then press ¸.
4. If necessary, press ¥‡ to display the table, and if the table contains
entries, press ƒn¸ to clear the table.
You see a table without entries, as in the first picture in Figure 9-4.
5. Enter values for the independent variable n in the first column.
You must enter values consecutively so no cell in the column is skipped —
but you don’t have to enter these values in numerical order. To make the
first entry, press ¸, use the number keys to enter a value, and then
press ¸ when you’re finished. To make entries after the first entry,
press D¸, enter a value, and then press ¸.
After you make each entry, the calculator automatically calculates the
corresponding terms of the checked sequences in the Y= editor, as
shown in the second picture in Figure 9-4.
As you can see in the second row of the table in the second picture in Figure
9-4, the calculator allows you to enter non-integer values for the independent
variable n. But because sequences are defined only for integer values of n,
the calculator will naturally tell you that the sequence is undefined. It will
also tell you that the sequence is undefined if you enter values of n that are
less than nmin, as indicated in the third row of this table. However, the calcu-
lator is quite comfortable with telling you the value of a term when n is larger
than nmax, as you see on the fourth row when nmax is set to 25.
Displaying hidden rows and columns
To display more rows in an automatically generated table, repeatedly press
C or D. If you have constructed a table for more than three sequences,
repeatedly press A or B to navigate through the columns of the table.
Figure 9-4:
Generating
a user-
defined
table.
123
Chapter 9: Exploring Sequences

Each time the calculator redisplays a table with a different set of rows, it also
automatically resets tblStart to the value of n appearing in the first row of the
newly displayed table. To return the table to its original state, press „ to
access the Table Setup editor and then change the value that the calculator
assigned to tblStart. Press ¸ to save the value you entered and then
press ¸ again to return to the table.
While the calculator displays a table of sequence terms, you can edit the 
definition of a sequence without going back to the Y= editor. To do this, use
the AB keys to place the cursor in the column of the sequence you want to
redefine and press †. This places the definition of the sequence on the com-
mand line so that you can edit the definition. (I explain editing expressions in
Chapter 1.) After you finish your editing, press ¸. The calculator auto-
matically updates the table and the edited definition of the sequence in the
Y= editor.
Viewing the table and the graph
on the same screen
After you graph your sequences and generate a table of sequence terms, you
can view the graph and the table on the same screen. To do so, follow these
steps:
1. Press 3„Bª to vertically divide the screen.
2. Press DBz to place the table in the left screen and then press DBy
to place the graph in the right screen.
If you prefer to have the graph on the left and the table on the right, just
reverse the order of keystrokes in this step by first pressing DBz and
then pressing DBy.
3. Press ¸ to save your Mode settings.
You now see a screen similar to that in the first picture in Figure 9-5.
Notice that the right screen may be empty. It appears in the next step.
Figure 9-5:
Viewing a
graph and a
table on the
same

124
Part IV: Working with Sequences, Parametric Equations, and Polar Equations 

4. Press 2O to toggle between the left and right screens.
The right screen is no longer empty, as in the second picture in Figure 9-5.
In a split screen, the screen with the bold border is the active screen, and the
commands for the application in that screen appear at the top of the screen.
In the second picture in Figure 9-5, the Graph screen is active. So, for exam-
ple, if you press … while in this application, you can trace the sequences
graphed in that screen. (Tracing a graph is explained earlier in this chapter.)
If you press 2O to make the table screen active and then press B, the
table displays the terms in the next checked sequence in the Y= editor.
To return to FULL screen mode without making changes in the Mode menu,
just press 2N. This automatically sets the Split Screen mode on Page 2
of the Mode menu to FULL.
Evaluating Sequences
The ‡ Graph Math menu contains a command that evaluates a sequence at
any specified value of the independent variable n. To access and use this
command, perform the following steps:
1. Graph the sequences in a viewing window that contains the specified
value of n.
I explain graphing sequences and setting the viewing window in Chapter
8. To get a viewing window containing the specified value of n, that value
must be between nmin and nmax in the viewing window.
2. If necessary, set the Graph Formats menu to display coordinates in
rectangular (x, y) form.
To do this, press ƒC¸B¨¸.
3. Press ‡¨ to invoke the Value command in the Graph Math menu.
4. Enter the specified value of n.
Use the keypad to enter the value of n. The number you enter overwrites
the value previously assigned to the value of nc that appears on the
screen.
5. Press ¸.
After you press ¸, the number of the first checked sequence in the
Y= editor appears at the top of the screen, the cursor appears on the
graph of that sequence at the specified value of n, and the coordinates of
the cursor appear at the bottom of the screen. This is illustrated in the
first picture in Figure 9-6.
125
Chapter 9: Exploring Sequences

6. Repeatedly press C to see the value of the other graphed sequences
at your specified value of n.
Each time you press C, the number of the sequence being evaluated
appears at the top of the screen, and the coordinates of the cursor loca-
tion appear at the bottom of the screen. This is illustrated in the second
picture in Figure 9-6, which displays the value of the third sequence in
the Y= editor.
After using the Value command to evaluate your sequences at one value of n,
you can evaluate your sequences at another value of n by keying in the new
value and pressing ¸. Pressing any function key (such as ¸ or B)
after evaluating a sequence deactivates the Value command.
If you plan to evaluate sequences at several specified values of n, consider con-
structing a user-defined table of sequence terms (as I explain in this chapter).
Enter n; press ¸

Parametric Equations
In This Chapter

 Tracing the graph of a pair of parametric equations
 Constructing a table of values of parametric equations
 Evaluating derivatives of parametric equations
 Finding the equation of a tangent to a parametric curve
A
s a particle moves along a curve, you usually want to know two things
about that particle: Where is it? How long did it take to get there?
The answer to the first question is pretty straightforward: The x- and 
y-coordinates of the particle tell you where it’s at. To get an answer to the
second question, you can bring a third variable — time — into the picture.
To answer both questions simultaneously, you express the x and y variables
as functions of t, the time variable.
The motion of the particle is thus described by the pair of parametric equa-
tions x = f(t) and y = g(t). In these equations, t is called the parameter, hence
the equation type: parametric.
In addition to motion, such equations also describe graphs that aren’t the
graphs of functions. An example of such a graph appears later in this chapter,
in Figure 10-3.
Entering Parametric Equations
The calculator can accommodate up to 99 pairs of parametric equations. To
avoid notational confusion, I denote these pairs of equations by xt1 and yt1
through xt99 and yt99; the calculator uses the notation xt1 and yt1 through xt99
and yt99. For the sake of simplicity, I tell you how to enter the pair xtk and ytk.

But what is stated in the following for xtk and ytk also applies to the pairs xt1
and yt1, xt2 and yt2, and so on. To enter a pair of parametric equations into the
calculator, follow these steps:
1. Press 3B© to put the calculator in Parametric mode (as shown in
Figure 10-1) and then press ¸ to save the Mode settings.
2. Press ¥ƒ and enter the definitions of xtk and ytk and then press
¸ to store each definition in the Y= editor.
To do this, use the C and D keys to place the cursor on xtk and then
press ¸ to place the cursor on the command line, where you enter
the definition. Any previously appearing definition is overwritten when
you key in the new definition. Press ¸ to store the definition in the
calculator and then repeat this process to store the definition of ytk in
the Y= editor. Examples of definitions of parametric equations appear in
Figure 10-1.
When you’re defining parametric equations, the only symbol the calcula-
tor allows you to use for the independent variable is the letter t. Press Ü
to enter this letter in your definitions. In Figure 10-1, I used this key to
define xt1, yt1, xt2, and yt3.
As a timesaver, when entering parametric equations in the Y= editor, you
can reference another equation in its definition provided that equation is
entered in the form xtk(t) or ytk(t) where k is the number of the equation.
The second picture in Figure 10-1 shows equation xt3 defined as yt2. You
enter the definition in xt3 by pressing ÚÜ©cÜd.
3. If you’re graphing more than one pair of parametric equations, give
each pair a unique graphing style so you can identify it in a graph of
multiple pairs of parametric equations.
In Parametric mode, you have six style choices: Line, Dot, Square, Thick,
Animate, and Path. The Path style uses a circle to indicate a point as it’s
being graphed, and when the graph is complete, the circle disappears
and leaves the graph in Line style. The Animate style also uses a circle
to indicate a point as it’s being graphed, but when the graph is com-
plete, no graph appears on-screen.
Set mode
Enter equations
Figure 10-1:
Entering
parametric
equations.
128
Part IV: Working with Sequences, Parametric Equations, and Polar Equations 

To set the style for a pair of equations xtk and ytk, use the CD keys to
highlight the definition of one of the equations in the pair and press
2ƒ to display the style menu. Then press the number of the desired
style. Setting the style for one equation in the pair of equations automat-
ically sets the style for both equations in the pair.
You must enter parametric equations in pairs. If you enter just one 
equation in the pair, say xtk but not ytk, then when you go to graph these
parametric equations, you won’t see a graph nor will you get an error
message warning you that there’s a problem.
Graphing Parametric Equations
After you enter the parametric equations into the calculator, you can use the
following steps to graph the equations:
1. If necessary, turn off any parametric equations and Stat Plots that you
don’t want to appear in your graph.
If you don’t know what I mean by this, press ¥ƒ to display the Y=
editor. If a checkmark appears to the left of one or both equations in a
pair of parametric equations in the Y= editor, that pair of equations will
be graphed. To prevent this from happening, use the CD keys to high-
light the definition of the equation, and then press † to remove the
checkmark. At a later time, when you do want to graph that pair of equa-
tions, repeat this process to reinstate the checkmark. In the second pic-
ture in Figure 10-1, the second and third pairs of equations have at least
one equation in the pair checked, so they will appear when graphed; the
first pair has no equation checked, so it won’t be graphed.
The first line in the Y= editor tells you the graphing status of the Stat
Plots. (I cover Stat Plots in Chapter 20.) If no number appears after
PLOTS on the very first line of the Y= editor (as in the second picture
in Figure 10-1), no Stat Plots are selected to be graphed. If one or more
numbers do appear, those Stat Plots will be graphed along with the
graph of your parametric equations.
To prevent an individual Stat Plot from being graphed, use the CD keys
to place the cursor on that Stat Plot and press †. († toggles between
deactivating and activating a Stat Plot.) To prevent all Stat Plots from
being graphed, press ‡z.
When you’re graphing parametric equations, Stat Plots that are active
when you don’t really want them graphed cause problems that could
result in an error message when you attempt to graph your parametric
equations. So if you aren’t planning to graph a Stat Plot along with
your equations, make sure all Stat Plots are turned off.
129
Chapter 10: Parametric Equations

2. If necessary, set the format for the graph by pressing ƒC¸ and
changing the selections in the Graph Formats menu.
I explain the Graph Formats menu in Chapter 5. It allows you to have
Coordinates displayed in rectangular (x, y) form, polar (r, θ) form, or not
displayed at all. Because I see no point in not knowing the coordinates of
the cursor location, my recommendation is to display the coordinates in
either rectangular or polar form.
The Grid option is your choice, either OFF or ON. And as far as the
other options go, my recommendation is to set Axes ON, Leading
Cursor OFF, and Labels OFF.
3. Press ¥„ to access the Window editor.
4. After each of the first three window variables, enter a numerical value
that is appropriate for the equations you’re graphing. Press ¸
after entering each number.
Figure 10-2 shows the Window editor when the calculator is in
Parametric mode. The following list explains the variables you must set
in this editor:
• tmin: This setting contains the first value of the independent vari-
able (parameter) t that the calculator will use to evaluate all para-
metric equations in the Y= editor. It can be set equal to any real
number. When t denotes time or angle measurements, it is usually
set to 0.
• tmax: This setting contains the largest value of the independent
variable (parameter) t that you want the calculator to use to evalu-
ate all parametric equations in the Y= editor. It can be set equal to
any real number. When t denotes angle measurements, it is usually
set to 2π.
• tstep: This setting tells the calculator how to increment the inde-
pendent variable t as it evaluates the parametric equations in the
Y= editor and graphs the corresponding points. It is usually set
equal to a positive real number. But you can set tstep equal to a
negative number provided that tmin is larger than tmax.

Part IV: Working with Sequences, Parametric Equations, and Polar Equations 

You want tstep to be a small number, like 0.1 or π/24, but you don’t
want it to be too small, like 0.001. If tstep is too small, it will take a
few minutes for the calculator to produce the graph; if it’s really,
really small (like 0.0001) you get an error message. And if tstep is a
large number like 1, the calculator might not graph enough points
to show you the true shape of the curve.
If it’s taking a long time for the calculator to graph your parametric
equations, and this causes you to regret that very small number
you placed in tstep, press ´ to terminate the graphing process.
You can then go back to the Window editor and adjust the tstep
setting.
When graphing parametric equations that use trigonometric func-
tions in their definitions, it’s best to set tmin, tmax, and tstep to
multiples of π. In Figure 10-2, tmax is set equal to 2π, and tstep is
set equal to π/24. You enter π into the calculator by pressing 2Z.
You use the remaining items in the Window editor to set a viewing
window for the graph (a procedure I explain in detail in Chapter 5). If
you know the dimensions of the viewing window required for your
graph, go ahead and assign numerical values to the remaining variables
in the Window editor and advance to Step 6. If you don’t know the mini-
mum and maximum x and y values required for your graph, the next step
tells you how to get the calculator to find them for you.
5. Press „CCC¸ to get ZoomFit to graph your equations.
After you’ve assigned values to tmin, tmax, and tstep, ZoomFit deter-
mines appropriate values for xmin, xmax, ymin, and ymax, and then
graphs your parametric equations. Note, however, that ZoomFit graphs
parametric equations in the smallest possible viewing window, and it
doesn’t assign new values to xscl and yscl. This is illustrated in the
second picture in Figure 10-2.
If you like the way the graph looks, you can skip the remaining steps. If
you’d like to spruce up the graph, Step 6 gives you some pointers. The
third picture in Figure 10-2 displays a spruced-up graph.
6. Press ¥„ and adjust the values assigned to the x and y settings.
Press ¸ after entering each new number.
Here’s how to readjust the viewing window after using ZoomFit:
• xmin and xmax: If you don’t want the graph to hit the left and
right sides of the screen, decrease the value assigned to xmin and
increase the value assigned to xmax. If you want to see the y-axis
on the graph, assign values to xmin and xmax so that zero is
between these two values.
• xscl: Set this equal to a value that doesn’t make the x-axis look like
railroad tracks — that is, an axis with far too many tick marks.
Twenty or fewer tick marks makes a nice-looking axis.
131
Chapter 10: Parametric Equations

• ymin and ymax: If you don’t want the graph to hit the top and
bottom of the screen, decrease the value assigned to ymin
and increase the value assigned to ymax. If you want to see the 
x-axis on the graph, assign values to ymin and ymax so that zero
is between these two values.
• yscl: Set this equal to a value that doesn’t make the y-axis look like
railroad tracks. Fifteen or fewer tick marks is a nice number for the
y-axis.
7. Press ¥… to regraph the parametric equations.
After you graph your parametric equations, you can save the graph and its
entire Window, Y= editor, Mode, and Format settings in a Graph Database.
When you recall the Database at a later time, you get more than just a picture
of the graph. The calculator also restores the Window, Y= editor, Mode, and
Format settings to those stored in the Database. Thus you can, for example,
trace the recalled graph.
To find out about the procedures for saving and recalling a graph database,
see Chapter 5.
Exploring Parametric Graphs
The calculator has three very useful features that help you explore the graphs
of parametric equations: zooming, tracing, and creating tables. Zooming allows
you to quickly adjust the viewing window for the graph so that you can get a
better idea of the nature of the graph. Tracing shows you the coordinates of
the points that make up the graph. Creating a table — well, I’m sure you
already know what that shows you. These sections explain how to zoom and
trace; the section “Displaying Equations in a Table” tells you how to create
tables.
Using Zoom commands
After you’ve graphed your parametric equations (as I explain earlier in this
chapter), press „ to access the Zoom menu. On this menu, you see all the
Zoom commands that are available for graphing functions. Not all of them
are useful when graphing parametric equations, however. Here are the ones
that I use when graphing parametric equations:
 ZoomFit: This command finds a viewing window for a specified portion
of the graph. I cover how to use ZoomFit in the section, “Graphing
Parametric Equations,” earlier in this chapter.
132
Part IV: Working with Sequences, Parametric Equations, and Polar Equations 

 ZoomSqr: Because the calculator screen is rectangular instead of
square, circles will look like ellipses if the viewing window isn’t properly
set. ZoomSqr adjusts the settings in the Window editor so that circles
look like circles. To use ZoomSqr, first graph your parametric equations
and then press „z. The graph is then redrawn in a viewing window
that makes circles look like circles. Figure 10-3 illustrates the effect that
ZoomSqr has on the spiral x = tcos(t), y = tsin(t).
 ZoomBox: After the graph is drawn (as I describe earlier in this chap-
ter), this command allows you to define a new viewing window for a por-
tion of your graph by enclosing it in a box, as illustrated in Figure 10-4.
The box becomes the new viewing window. To construct the box:
1. Press „¨.
2. Define a corner of the box.
To do so, use the ABCD keys to move the cursor to the spot
where you want one corner of the box to be located and then press
¸. The calculator marks that corner of the box with a small
square.
3. Construct the box.
To do so, press the ABCD keys. As you press these keys, the cal-
culator draws the sides of the box.
When you use ZoomBox, if you don’t like the size of the box, you
can use any of the ABCD keys to resize the box. If you don’t like
the location of the corner you anchored in Step 2, press N and
start over with Step 1. If you’re drawing a rather large box, to move
the cursor a large distance, press 2 and then press an appropri-
ate arrow key.
4. When you’re finished drawing the box, press ¸.
The calculator redraws the graph in the viewing window specified
by the box.
When you use ZoomBox, you press ¸ only two times. The first
time you press it is to anchor a corner of the zoom box. The next
time you press ¸ is when you’re finished drawing the box and
you’re ready to have the calculator redraw the graph.
ZoomFit

Chapter 10: Parametric Equations

 Zoom In and Zoom Out: After the graph is drawn (as I describe earlier
in this chapter), these commands allow you to zoom in on a portion of
the graph or to zoom out from the graph. They work very much like a
zoom lens on a camera. To use these commands:
1. Press „© if you want to zoom in, or press „ª if you want to
zoom out.
2. Use the ABCD keys to move the cursor to the spot on-screen
from which you want to zoom in or zoom out.
This spot becomes the center of the new viewing window.
3. Press ¸.
The graph is redrawn centered at the cursor location.
If you use a Zoom command to redraw a graph and then want to undo what
that command did to the graph, press „CCB¨ to select ZoomPrev from
the Zoom Memory menu. The graph is then redrawn as it appeared in the
previous viewing window.
Tracing a parametric graph
After you graph your parametric equations (as I describe earlier in this chap-
ter), you can have the cursor display the coordinates of the points on the
graph by tracing it. To trace a parametric graph, follow these steps:
1. If necessary, set Coordinates in the Graph Formats menu to RECT or
POLAR.
If you know that you are already in the rectangular or polar format,
you can skip this step. Otherwise press ƒC¸B to access the
Coordinates option in the Graph Formats menu and then press ¨ to
have the coordinates displayed in (x, y) rectangular form or press © for
(r, θ) polar form. Press ¸ to save this setting.
2. Press … and then use B to trace the graph.

Using
ZoomBox.
134
Part IV: Working with Sequences, Parametric Equations, and Polar Equations 

As you investigate a parametric graph by tracing it, here’s what you will see:
 The number of the pair of parametric equations: The number of the pair
of equations in the Y= editor that you’re tracing is displayed in the top-
right corner of the screen. For example, if you see the number 1, then
you’re tracing the first pair of equations (xt1 and yt1) in the Y= editor. If
you’ve graphed more than one pair of equations and you would like to
trace a different pair, repeatedly press C until the number of the desired
pair of equations appears.
 The value of the parameter t: At the bottom of the screen you see a
value for tc. This is the value of the independent variable (parameter) t
at the cursor location. Each time you press B, the cursor moves to the
next plotted point in the graph and updates the value of tc. If you press
A, the cursor moves left to the previously plotted point. And if you
press C to trace a different pair of equations, the tracing of that pair
starts at the same value of tc that was displayed on-screen before you
pressed this key.
When you’re using Trace, if you want to start tracing the graph at a spe-
cific value of the parameter t, just key in that value and press ¸.
(The value you assign to t must be between tmin and tmax; if it isn’t, you
get an error message.) After you press ¸, the trace cursor moves to
the point on the graph corresponding to that value of t. But the calcula-
tor doesn’t change the viewing window. So if you don’t see the cursor,
it’s on the part of the graph outside the viewing window. The sidebar
“Panning in Parametric mode” tells you how to get the cursor and the
graph in the same viewing window.
135
Chapter 10: Parametric Equations
Panning in Parametric mode
When you’re tracing parametric equations and
the cursor hits an edge of the screen, if tc is less
than tmax and you continue to press B, the
coordinates of the cursor are displayed at the
bottom of the screen. However, because the
calculator doesn’t automatically adjust the
viewing window, you won’t see the cursor on
the graph. To rectify this situation, make a
mental note of the value of tc (or jot it down) and
then press ¸. The calculator then redraws
the graph centered at the location of the cursor
at the time you pressed ¸. Then press …
to continue tracing the graph.
Unfortunately, after the graph is redrawn, the
trace cursor is placed at the beginning of the
graph of the first pair of equations appearing in
the Y= editor. To get the trace cursor back on the
part of the graph displayed in the new viewing
window, key in the value of tc that you made
note of, and then press ¸. If you weren’t
tracing the first pair of equations appearing in
the Y= editor, use C to place the cursor on the
graph you were tracing. The trace cursor then
appears in the middle of the screen, and you
can use A or B to continue tracing the graph.
When tc equals tmax, pressing B has no effect
because the cursor has reached the end of the
graph and can go no farther.

 The coordinates of the cursor: On the last line of the screen, you see
the coordinates of the cursor location. In rectangular form, these coordi-
nates are denoted by xc and yc; in polar form they are rc and θc.
Press N to terminate tracing the graph. This also removes the number of
the pair of parametric equations and the coordinates of the cursor from the
screen.
If the number of the pair of equations at the top of the screen and the coordi-
nates at the bottom of the screen are interfering with your view of the graph
when you use Trace, increase the height of the window by pressing ¥2,
and decreasing the value of ymin, and increasing the value of ymax.
Displaying Equations in a Table
After you’ve entered the parametric equations in the Y= editor (as I describe
earlier in this chapter), you can have the calculator create one of three differ-
ent types of tables of values of your parametric equations:
 An automatically generated table that displays the plotted points
appearing in the calculator’s graphs of the parametric equations
 An automatically generated table that displays the points using the 
initial t-value and t-increment that you specify
 A user-defined table in which you enter the t-values of your choice and
the calculator determines the corresponding values of the parametric
equations
The following sections discuss these tables in greater detail.
Creating automatically generated tables
To create a table in which you specify the initial t-value and the value by
which t is incremented, perform the following steps. After the last step, I tell
you how to create an automatically generated table displaying the points
graphed by the calculator.
1. Place a checkmark to the left of those equations in the Y= editor that
you want to appear in the table; leave the other equations unchecked.
Only the equations in the Y= editor that have checkmarks to the left of
their names will appear in the table. If only one equation in a pair of
equations is checked, only the checked equation appears in the table.
For example, the second picture in Figure 10-1 (shown earlier) indicates
that only equations xt2, xt3, and yt3 are slated to appear in a table.

Part IV: Working with Sequences, Parametric Equations, and Polar Equations 

To check or uncheck an equation, press ¥ƒ, use the CD keys to place
the cursor on the equation, and then press † to toggle between check-
ing and unchecking the function.
2. Press ¥† to access the Table Setup editor (shown in Figure 10-5).
3. Enter a number in tblStart and press D, and then enter a number in
∆tbl and press D.
If Independent is the only item you see in the Table Setup editor, and if
the cursor is on ASK, press B¨ to change this setting to AUTO and then
press CCC to enter numbers in tblStart and ∆tbl.
tblStart is the first value of the independent variable t to appear in the
table, and ∆tbl is the increment for the independent variable t. The calcu-
lator constructs the table by adding the value you assign to ∆tbl to the
previous t-value and calculating the corresponding values of the paramet-
ric equations. In the first picture in Figure 10-5, tblStart is assigned the
value 0 and ∆tbl is assigned the value –1 to produce the decreasing
values in the t-column of the table in the second picture in this figure.
Use the number keys to enter values in tblStart and ∆tbl. Press D after
making each entry.
4. Set Graph <–> Table to OFF (as shown in Figure 10-5).
You have two choices for the Graph <–> Table setting: OFF and ON.
When Graph <–> Table is set to ON, a table of the points plotted in the
calculator’s graphs of the equations is created. However, if Graph <–>
Table is set to OFF, the calculator uses the values in tblStart and ∆tbl to
generate the table.
To change the Graph <–> Table setting, use CD to place the cursor on
the existing setting, press B to display the options for that setting, and
press the number of the option you want.
5. Press ¸ to save the settings in the Table Setup editor.
6. If necessary, press ¥‡ to display the table.
The table appears on the screen, as illustrated in the second picture in
Figure 10-5. I explain navigating the table later in this chapter.

Chapter 10: Parametric Equations

To create a table of the plotted points appearing in the calculator’s graphs of
the parametric equations, follow Steps 1 and 2. If Independent is the only
item you see in the Table Setup editor, press B¨ to change this setting to
AUTO and then press CB©¸ to set Graph <–> Table to ON and to save
your settings. On the other hand, if you see all four items in this editor, press
DDB©D¨¸ to set Graph <–> Table to ON and to save your settings.
(With these settings, the calculator ignores the other values in the Table
Setup menu.) If necessary, press ¥‡ to display the table, as shown in the
third picture in Figure 10-5.
Creating user-defined tables
To create a user-defined table in which you enter values of the parameter t
and the calculator figures out the corresponding values of the parametric
equations, follow these steps:
1. Place a checkmark to the left of each function in the Y= editor that
you want to appear in the table; leave the other functions unchecked.
Only those functions in the Y= editor that have checkmarks to the left of
their names will appear in the table. To check or uncheck a function,
press ¥ƒ, use the CD keys to place the cursor on the function, and
then press † to toggle between checking and unchecking the function.
2. Press ¥† to access the Table Setup editor.
3. Set Independent to ASK and press ¸.
Independent is the last item in the menu. If it is already set to ASK,
press ¸ and go to the next step. If it is set to AUTO, press DDDB©
to set Independent to ASK and then press ¸.
4. If necessary, press ¥‡ to display the table. If the table contains
entries, press †n¸ to clear the table.
You see a table without entries, as in the first picture in Figure 10-6.
Figure 10-6:
Generating
a user-
defined

138
Part IV: Working with Sequences, Parametric Equations, and Polar Equations 

5. Enter values for the parameter t in the first column.
You must enter values consecutively; you cannot skip any cells in the
first column of the table. To make the first entry, press ¸, use the
number keys to enter a value, and then press ¸ when you’re fin-
ished. To make entries after the first entry, press D¸, enter a value,
and then press ¸.
After you make each entry, the calculator automatically calculates the
corresponding values of the checked parametric equations in the Y=
editor, as shown in the second picture of Figure 10-6.
Displaying hidden rows and columns
To display more rows in an automatically generated table, repeatedly press
C or D. If you have constructed a table for more than three equations,
repeatedly press A or B to navigate through the columns of the table.
Each time the calculator re-displays a table with a different set of rows, it also
automatically resets tblStart to the value of t appearing in the first row of the
newly displayed table. To return the table to its original state, press „ to
access the Table Setup editor and then change the value that the calculator
assigned to tblStart. Press ¸ to save the value you entered and then
press ¸ again to return to the table.
While displaying a table, you can edit the definition of a parametric equation
without going back to the Y= editor. To do this, use the AB keys to place the
cursor in the column of the equation you want to redefine and press †. This
places the definition of the equation on the command line so that you can
edit the definition. (I tell you how to edit expressions in Chapter 1.) When
you’re finished with your editing, press ¸. The calculator automatically
updates the table and the edited definition of the equation in the Y= editor.
Viewing the table and the graph
on the same screen
After you graph your parametric equations and generate a table, you can view
the graph and the table on the same screen. To do so, follow these steps:
1. Press 3„Bª to vertically divide the screen.
2. Press DBz to place the table in the left screen, and then press DBy
to place the graph in the right screen.
If you prefer to have the graph on the left and the table on the right, just
reverse the order of keystrokes in this step by first pressing DBy and
then pressing DBz.
139
Chapter 10: Parametric Equations

3. Press ¸ to save your Mode settings.
You now see a screen similar to that in the first picture in Figure 10-7.
Notice that the right screen does not contain a graph. It appears in the
next step.
4. Press 2O to toggle between the left and right screens.
The right screen is no longer empty, as in the second picture in
Figure 10-7.
In a split screen, the half with the bold border is active, and the commands for
that application appear at the top of the screen. For example, in the second
picture in Figure 10-7, the Graph screen is active. So if you press … while in
this application, you can trace the pair of parametric equations graphed in
that screen. (I show you how to trace a graph earlier in this chapter.)
To return to FULL screen mode without making changes in the Mode menu,
just press 2N. This automatically sets the Split Screen mode on Page 2
of the Mode menu to FULL.
Analyzing Parametric Equations
After graphing parametric equations (as described earlier in this chapter),
you can use the options in the ‡ Graph Math menu to find the value of the
parametric equations at a specified value of t and to evaluate derivatives
(dy/dx, dx/dt, and dy/dt) at a specified value of t. The calculator will even find
the equation of a tangent to the graph at a specified point on the graph. And
it will find the length of a portion of the graph or the distance between two
points on the same curve or on different curves. This section tells you how
to use the Graph Math menu to accomplish these tasks.
Evaluating parametric equations
When you trace the graph, the trace cursor doesn’t hit every point on
the graph. So tracing isn’t a reliable way of finding the values of a pair of
Figure 10-7:
Viewing a
graph and a
table on the
same
screen.
140
Part IV: Working with Sequences, Parametric Equations, and Polar Equations 

parametric equations at a specified value of the parameter t. The ‡ Graph
Math menu, however, contains a command that evaluates a pair of paramet-
ric equations at any specified t-value. To access and use this command, per-
form the following steps:
1. Graph the equations in a viewing window that contains the specified
value of t.
The graph contains a specified value of t when that value is between
tmin and tmax in the Window editor. I explain graphing parametric equa-
tions and setting tmin and tmax earlier in this chapter.
2. If necessary, set the Graph Formats menu to display coordinates in
rectangular (x, y) form or in polar (r, θ) form.
To do this, press ƒC¸B. Press ¨ for rectangular form or press ©
for polar form. Then press ¸ to save these settings.
3. Press ‡¨ to invoke the Value command in the Graph Math menu.
4. Enter the specified value of t.
Use the keypad to enter a value of t that is between tmin and tmax, as
illustrated in the first picture in Figure 10-8. As you enter t, the value of
tc at the bottom of the screen is replaced by the number you key in.
5. Press ¸ to evaluate the parametric equations.
After you press ¸, the number of the first checked pair of parametric
equations in the Y= editor appears at the top of the screen, the cursor
appears on the graph of those equations at the specified value of t, and
the coordinates of the cursor appear at the bottom of the screen. This is
illustrated in the second picture in Figure 10-8.
6. Repeatedly press C to see the value of the other graphed parametric
equations at your specified value of t.
Each time you press C, the number of the pair of equations being evalu-
ated appears at the top of the screen, and the coordinates of the cursor
location appear at the bottom of the screen. This is illustrated in the
third picture in Figure 10-8.
Enter t
Press ¸
Press C

Chapter 10: Parametric Equations

After using the Value command to evaluate your parametric equations at one
value of t, you can evaluate them at another value of t by keying in the new
value and pressing ¸. Pressing any function key (such as ¸ or B)
after evaluating parametric equations deactivates the Value command.
If you plan to evaluate parametric equations at several specified values of t,
consider constructing a user-defined table of values of parametric equations
(as I explain earlier in this chapter).
Finding derivatives
To find the derivative (dy/dx, dy/dt, or dx/dt) of a pair of parametric equations
at a specified value of t, follow these steps:
1. Graph the equations in a viewing window that contains the specified
value of t. 
The graph contains a specified value of t when that value is between
tmin and tmax in the Window editor. I explain graphing parametric equa-
tions and setting tmin and tmax earlier in this chapter.
2. If necessary, set the Graph Formats menu to display coordinates in
rectangular (x, y) form or in polar (r, θ) form.
To do this, press ƒC¸B. Press ¨ for rectangular form or press ©
for polar form. Then press ¸ to save these settings.
3. Press ‡{ to display the Derivatives submenu of the Graph Math
menu and then press ¨, ©, or ª to select the dy/dx, dy/dt, or dx/dt
option.
Instructions appear at the bottom of the screen, as illustrated in the first
picture in Figure 10-9. If these instructions interfere with your view of
the graph, create more space at the bottom of the screen by pressing
¥„ and decreasing the value of ymin. Then press ¥… to redraw the
graph and repeat Step 3 to reactivate the Derivatives option.
4. If necessary, repeatedly press C until the number of the appropriate
pair of parametric equations appears at the top of the screen.
5. Enter the value (t) of the parameter to be used to evaluate the 
derivative.
Use the keypad to enter a value of t that is between tmin and tmax, as
illustrated in the first picture in Figure 10-9. As you enter t, the value of
tc at the bottom of the screen is replaced by the number you key in.
6. Press ¸ to evaluate the derivative.
After pressing ¸, the cursor moves to the point on the graph corre-
sponding to the specified value of t and the derivative at that value is dis-
played at the bottom of the screen, as in the second picture in Figure 10-9.
142
Part IV: Working with Sequences, Parametric Equations, and Polar Equations 

Finding the distance between points
The calculator has a neat feature that draws a line between two points on the
same or different parametric curves and calculates the distance between
these two points. To use this feature, follow these steps:
1. Graph the parametric equations in a viewing window that displays the
two points between which you want to find the distance.
I cover graphing parametric equations and finding an appropriate view-
ing window earlier in this chapter.
2. If necessary, set the Graph Formats menu to display coordinates in
rectangular (x, y) form or in polar (r, θ) form.
To do this, press ƒC¸B. Press ¨ for rectangular form or press ©
for polar form. Then press ¸ to save these settings.
3. Press ‡o to select the Distance command from the Graph Math menu.
If the calculator instructions at the bottom of the screen interfere with
your view of the graph, create more space at the bottom of the screen
by pressing ¥„ and decreasing the value of ymin. Then press ¥… to
redraw the graph and press ‡o to reinstate the Distance command.
4. If necessary, repeatedly press C until the number of the parametric
equations containing the first point appears at the top of the screen.
5. Enter the value of the parameter t corresponding to the first point and
then press ¸.
Use the keypad to enter a value of t that is between tmin and tmax. As
you enter t, the value of tc at the bottom of the screen is replaced by the
number you key in. After you press ¸, the cursor moves to that
point, as illustrated in the first picture in Figure 10-10.
6. If the second point is on a different curve, repeatedly press C until
the number of the parametric equations containing the second point
appears at the top of the screen.
The cursor jumps to the point on the other curve that is defined by
the same value t, a line is drawn between these points, and you’re
prompted to enter the second point, as illustrated in the second picture
in Figure 10-10. 
Enter t
Press ¸

7. Enter the value of the parameter t corresponding to the second point
and then press ¸.
The calculator connects the two points with a line and displays the 
distance between these points, as illustrated in the third picture in
Figure 10-10.
Finding the equation of a tangent line
Not only can the calculator draw a tangent to a parametric curve at a speci-
fied value of the parameter t, but it can also tell you the equation of that tan-
gent. To get the calculator to do this, follow these steps:
1. Graph the parametric equations in a viewing window that displays the
point of tangency.
You find out about graphing parametric equations and finding an appro-
priate viewing window earlier in this chapter. 
2. If necessary, set the Graph Formats menu to display coordinates in
rectangular (x, y) form or in polar (r, θ) form.
To do this, press ƒC¸B. Press ¨ for rectangular form or press ©
for polar form. Then press ¸ to save these settings.
3. Press ‡CCC¸ to select the Tangent command from the Graph
Math menu.
If the calculator instructions at the bottom of the screen interfere with
your view of the graph, create more space at the bottom of the screen
by pressing ¥„ and decreasing the value of ymin. Then press ¥… to
redraw the graph and press ‡CCC¸ to reinstate the Tangent
command.
4. If necessary, repeatedly press C until the number of the parametric
equations containing the point of tangency appears.
5. Enter the value of the parameter t at the point of tangency.
Use the keypad to enter a value of t that is between tmin and tmax. As
you enter t, the value of tc at the bottom of the screen is replaced by the
number you key in, as illustrated in the first picture in Figure 10-11.

6. Press ¸ to construct the tangent and display its equation.
The tangent appears on the graph with the cursor located at the point of
tangency, and the equation of the tangent appears at the bottom of the
screen, as illustrated in the second picture in Figure 10-11.
A tangent drawn by the Tangent command in the Graph Math menu doesn’t
automatically vanish when you use another Graph Math menu option or
when you trace the graph. To erase the tangent, press † to redraw the graph
without the tangent line.
Evaluating arc length
The Arc command in the Graph Math menu can find the length of a section
(arc) of a graphed curve when you specify the beginning and ending point of
the section. To get the calculator to find this length, follow these steps: 
1. Graph the parametric equation in a viewing window displaying the
part of the curve you want to measure.
I explain graphing parametric equations and finding an appropriate
viewing window earlier in this chapter. 
2. If necessary, set the Graph Formats menu to display coordinates in
rectangular (x, y) form or in polar (r, θ) form.
To do this, press ƒC¸B. Press ¨ for rectangular form or press ©
for polar form. Then press ¸ to save these settings.
3. Press ‡CC¸ to select the Arc command from the Graph Math
menu.
If the calculator instructions at the bottom of the screen interfere with
your view of the graph, create more space at the bottom of the screen
by pressing ¥„ and decreasing the value of ymin. Then press ¥… to
redraw the graph and press ‡CC¸ to reinstate the Arc command.

4. If necessary, repeatedly press C until the number of the appropriate
pair of parametric equations appears at the top of the screen.
5. Enter the value of the parameter t corresponding to the first point
defining arc length and then press ¸.
Use the keypad to enter a value of t that is between tmin and tmax. As
you enter t, the value of tc at the bottom of the screen is replaced by the
number you key in. After you press ¸, the cursor moves to that
point and prompts you to enter the second point, as illustrated in the
first picture in Figure 10-12.
6. Enter the value of the parameter t corresponding to the second point
defining the arc (or use the BA keys to move the cursor to that point)
and press ¸.
The calculator displays the length of the arc at the bottom of the screen,
as illustrated in the second picture in Figure 10-12.
When finding arc length, if the value of the parameter t that you enter to define
the first point of the arc is larger than the value of t you enter to define the
second point of the arc, then the arc length displayed by the calculator is nega-
tive. The true arc length is just the absolute value of the answer displayed by
the calculator.

n the polar coordinate system, a point P in the plane is described by its
distance r from the origin and the angle θ made by the positive x-axis and
the line through the origin and point P. The polar coordinates of the point P
are denoted by (r, θ). This is illustrated in Figure 11-1.
Converting Coordinates
You’re probably used to seeing points in the xy-plane displayed in the (x, y)
rectangular form. But when dealing with polar equations, we view these
points in their (r, θ) polar form. To convert (x, y) from rectangular to polar
form, follow these steps:
1. Enter the rectangular coordinates surrounded by brackets instead of
parentheses, as illustrated in the first entry in Figure 11-2.
To insert the brackets, press 2b and 2e. Press b to separate the
coordinates.
Figure 11-1:
Represent-
ing a point
in polar
coordinates.

2. Press 2zy to access the MATH Matrix menu.
3. Press CBy to select the Polar option from the Vector Options menu.
4. Press ¸ to convert the rectangular coordinates to polar 
coordinates.
If your calculator is in Radian mode, the angle θ is displayed after the
angle symbol in radians, as illustrated in the first entry in the first pic-
ture in Figure 11-2. If it’s in Degree mode, θ appears in degrees, as in the
first entry in the second picture of this figure.
If you don’t know the Angle mode of your calculator, look at the bottom of
the screen, where you see either RAD (as in the first picture in Figure 11-2)
or DEG (as in the second picture), indicating that your calculator is in
Radian or Degree mode. I explain setting the mode in Chapter 1.
To convert (r, θ) from polar to rectangular coordinates, follow these steps:
1. Press 2b to enter the left bracket and then enter the value of r and
press b.
Brackets must surround your coordinates.
2. Press 2^ (the angle symbol) to tell the calculator you are about to
enter an angle.
^ is the third key from the bottom in the left column of calculator keys.
3. Enter the value of the angle θ. 
4. If appropriate, press 2Í to tell the calculator that the angle you
entered is measured in degrees or press 2z©© to indicate that the
angle is in radians.
If the angle you entered in Step 3 is measured in the same Angle mode
(Radians or Degrees) as the calculator, you can skip this step. However
if the measurement of the angle isn’t the same as the Angle mode, you
have to tell the calculator about this discrepancy by placing the appro-
priate symbol after the angle. Entering angles measured in units other

than the Angle mode of the calculator is illustrated in the two pictures
in Figure 11-2. In the first picture, the calculator is in Radian mode, as
indicated by RAD on the last line of the screen. So you need the degree
symbol when entering an angle measured in degrees (as in the second
entry on the screen), but you don’t need the radian symbol when enter-
ing an angle measured in radians (as in the third entry on the screen).
You enter the degree symbol by pressing 2Í after entering the angle.
In the second picture on Figure 11-2, the calculator is in Degree mode,
as indicated by DEG on the last line of the screen. So when entering an
angle that is measured in degrees, no degree symbol is needed, as in the
second entry on the screen. But when entering an angle in radians,
the radian symbol is necessary, as in the third entry on the screen. The
radian symbol is entered by pressing 2z©© after entering the angle.
5. Press 2e to close the brackets and then press 2zy to access the
MATH Matrix menu.
6. Press CBz to select the Rect option from the Vector Options menu.
7. Press ¸ to convert your polar coordinates to rectangular 
coordinates.
This is illustrated in the second and third entries in both pictures in
Figure 11-2.
Entering Polar Equations
The calculator can accommodate up to 99 polar equations. To avoid notational
confusion, I denote these polar equations with r1 through r99; the calculator
uses the notation r1 through r99. For the sake of simplicity, I tell you how to
enter the equation rk. But what is stated in the following for rk also applies to r1,
r2, and so on. To enter polar equations into the calculator, follow these steps:
1. If your calculator isn’t in Polar mode, press 3Bª to select the
POLAR option (as shown in Figure 11-3) and then press ¸ to save
the Mode settings.
Set mode
Enter equations
Figure 11-3:
Entering
polar

149
Chapter 11: Polar Equations

2. Press ¥ƒ and enter the definition of rk. Press ¸ to store the defi-
nition in the Y= editor.
Use the C and D keys to place the cursor on rk and then press ¸ to
place the cursor on the command line, where you enter the definition. Any
previously appearing definition will be overwritten when you key in the
new definition. After entering the definition, press ¸ to store it in the
Y= editor. Examples of definitions of polar equations appear in Figure 11-3.
When you’re defining polar equations, the only symbol the calculator
allows for the independent variable is the Greek letter θ. Press ¥Z to
enter this letter in your definitions.
As a timesaver, when entering polar equations in the Y= editor, you can
reference another equation in its definition provided that you enter the
equation in the form rk(θ) where k is the number of the equation. The
second picture in Figure 11-3 shows equation r4 defined as –r3. You enter
the definition in r4 by pressing ·É©ªc¥Zd.
3. If you’re graphing more than one polar equation, give each equation a
unique graphing style so you can identify it in a graph of multiple
polar equations.
In Polar mode, you have six style choices: Line, Dot, Square, Thick,
Animate, and Path. The Path style uses a circle to indicate the location
of the cursor as it draws the graph, and when the graph is complete, the
circle disappears and leaves the graph in Line style. The Animate style
also uses a circle to indicate a point as it’s being graphed, but when the
graph is complete, no graph appears on-screen.
To set the style for a polar equation, use the CD keys to highlight the
definition of the equation and press 2ƒ to display the style menu.
Then press the number of the desired style.
Graphing Polar Equations
After you enter the polar equations into the calculator, as I describe in the
preceding section, you can use the following steps to graph the equations:
1. If necessary, turn off any polar equations and Stat Plots that you don’t
want to appear in your graph.
If you don’t know what I mean by this, press ¥ƒ to display the Y=
editor. If a checkmark appears to the left of a polar equation in the Y=
editor, that equation will be graphed. To prevent this from happening,
use the CD keys to highlight the definition of the equation and then
press † to remove the checkmark. At a later time, when you do want to
graph that equation, repeat this process to reinstate the checkmark. In
the second picture in Figure 11-3, only r3 is checked to be graphed.
150
Part IV: Working with Sequences, Parametric Equations, and Polar Equations 

The first line in the Y= editor tells you the graphing status of the Stat
Plots. (Chapter 20 discusses Stat Plots.) If no number appears after
PLOTS on the very first line of the Y= editor, as in the second picture in
Figure 11-3, then no Stat Plots are selected to be graphed. If one or more
numbers do appear, those Stat Plots will be graphed along with the
graph of your polar equations.
To prevent an individual Stat Plot from being graphed, use the CD keys
to place the cursor on that Stat Plot and press †. († toggles between
deactivating and activating a Stat Plot.) To prevent all Stat Plots from
being graphed, press ‡z.
When you’re graphing polar equations, Stat Plots that are active when
you don’t really want them graphed cause problems that could result in
an error message when you attempt to graph your polar equations. So if
you aren’t planning to graph a Stat Plot along with your equations, make
sure all Stat Plots are turned off.
2. If necessary, set the format for the graph by pressing ƒC¸ and
changing the selections in the Graph Formats menu.
I explain the Graph Formats menu in Chapter 5. It allows you to have
Coordinates displayed in rectangular (x, y) form, polar (r, θ) form, or not
displayed at all. Because I see no point in not knowing the coordinates of
the cursor location, my recommendation is to display the coordinates in
either rectangular or polar form.
The Grid option is your choice, either OFF or ON. And as far as the other
options go, my recommendation is to set Axes ON, Leading Cursor OFF,
and Labels OFF.
3. Press ¥„ to access the Window editor. 
4. After each of the first three window variables, enter a numerical value
that is appropriate for the equations you’re graphing. Press ¸
after entering each value.
The first picture in Figure 11-4 displays the Window editor when the cal-
culator is in Polar mode. The following list explains the variables you
must set in this editor:
• θmin: This setting contains the first value of the independent vari-
able θ that the calculator will use to evaluate all polar equations in
the Y= editor. It can be set equal to any real number.
Window
θmax = 2π
θmax = 4π
Figure 11-4:
Graphing
polar

151
Chapter 11: Polar Equations

• θmax: This setting contains the largest value of the independent
variable θ that you want the calculator to use to evaluate all polar
equations in the Y= editor. It can be set equal to any real number.
θmax is usually set equal to 2π. However, as illustrated in Figure
11-4, there are occasions when you might want to set it equal to a
larger number, such as 4π. You enter π into the calculator by press-
ing 2Z.
• θstep: This setting tells the calculator how to increment the inde-
pendent variable θ as it evaluates the polar equations in the Y=
editor and graphs the corresponding points.
θstep must be a positive real number. You want θstep to be a small
number, like π/24, but you don’t want it to be too small, like 0.001.
If θstep is too small, it will take a few minutes for the calculator to
produce the graph. And if θstep is a large number, like 1, the calcu-
lator may not graph enough points to show you the true shape of
the curve.
If it’s taking a long time for the calculator to graph your polar equa-
tions, and you start to regret that very small number you placed in
θstep, press ´ to terminate the graphing process. You can then
go back to the Window editor and adjust the θstep setting.
The remaining items in the Window editor deal with setting a viewing
window for your graphs (a procedure I explain in detail in Chapter 5). If
you know the dimensions of the viewing window required for your
graphs, go ahead and assign numerical values to the remaining variables
in the Window editor and advance to Step 7. If you don’t know the mini-
mum and maximum x and y values required for your graphs, the next
step tells you how to get the calculator to find them for you.
5. Press „CCC¸ to get ZoomFit to graph your polar equations.
After you’ve assigned values to θmin, θmax, and θstep, ZoomFit deter-
mines appropriate values for xmin, xmax, ymin, and ymax, and then
graphs your polar equations. Note, however, that ZoomFit graphs polar
equations in the smallest possible viewing window, and it doesn’t assign
new values to xscl and yscl. This is illustrated in the graphs in Figure 11-4.
If you like the way the graph looks, you can skip the remaining steps. If
you’d like to spruce up the graph, Step 6 gives you some pointers. 
6. Press ¥„ and adjust the values assigned to the x and y settings.
Press ¸ after entering each new number.
Here’s how to readjust the viewing window after using ZoomFit:
• xmin and xmax: If you don’t want the graph to hit the left and
right sides of the screen, decrease the value assigned to xmin and
increase the value assigned to xmax. If you want to see the y-axis
on the graph, assign values to xmin and xmax so that zero is
between these two values.
152
Part IV: Working with Sequences, Parametric Equations, and Polar Equations 

• xscl: Set this equal to a value that doesn’t make the x-axis look like
railroad tracks — that is, an axis with far too many tick marks.
Twenty or fewer tick marks makes for a nice-looking axis.
• ymin and ymax: If you don’t want the graph to hit the top and
bottom of the screen, decrease the value assigned to ymin and
increase the value assigned to ymax. If you want to see the x-axis
on the graph, assign values to ymin and ymax so that zero is
between these two values.
When you trace a graph, the calculator needs two lines of text to dis-
play the coordinates of the cursor. And when you use the options in
the Graph Math menu, it needs three lines of text to display its direc-
tions. If you don’t want this text to be written on top of your graph,
decrease the value of ymin so that two or three lines of blank space
exist between the graph and the bottom of the screen. I cover trac-
ing and using the Graph Math menu later in this chapter.
• yscl: Set this equal to a value that doesn’t make the y-axis look like
railroad tracks. Fifteen or fewer tick marks is a nice number for the
y-axis.
7. Press ¥… to regraph the polar equations.
After you’ve graphed your polar equations, you can save the graph and its
entire Window, Y= editor, Mode, and Format settings in a Graph Database.
When you recall the Database at a later time, you get more than just a picture
of the graph. The calculator also restores the Window, Y= editor, Mode, and
Format settings to those stored in the Database. Thus you can, for example,
trace the recalled graph. Chapter 5 has the details on saving and recalling a
graph database.
Exploring Polar Equations
The calculator lets you explore the graphs of polar equations in three ways:
by zooming, by tracing, and by creating tables. Zooming allows you to
quickly adjust the viewing window for the graph so that you can get a better
idea of the nature of the graph. Tracing shows you the coordinates of the
points that make up the graph, and creating a table — well, I’m sure you
already know what that shows you. In this section, you find out how to zoom
and trace; the next section tells you how to create tables.
Using Zoom commands
After you graph your polar equations (as I explain earlier in this chapter), press
„ to access the Zoom menu. On this menu, you see all the Zoom commands
153
Chapter 11: Polar Equations

that are available for graphing functions. Not all of them are useful when graph-
ing polar equations, however. Here are the ones that I use when graphing polar
equations:
 ZoomFit: This command finds a viewing window for a specified portion
of the graph. I tell you how to use ZoomFit in the section, “Graphing
Polar Equations,” earlier in this chapter.
 ZoomSqr: Because the calculator screen is rectangular instead of
square, circles look like ellipses if the viewing window isn’t properly set.
ZoomSqr adjusts the settings in the Window editor so that circles look
like circles. To use ZoomSqr, first graph your polar equations and then
press „z. The calculator then redraws the graph in a viewing window
that makes circles look like circles. Figure 11-5 illustrates the effect that
ZoomSqr has on the graph of the cardioid r1 in Figure 11-3.
 ZoomBox: After the graph is drawn (as I describe earlier in this chap-
ter), this command allows you to define a new viewing window for a por-
tion of your graph by enclosing it in a box, as illustrated in Figure 11-6.
The box becomes the new viewing window. To construct the box:
1. Press „¨.
2. Define a corner of the box.
To do so, use the ABCD keys to move the cursor to the spot
where you want one corner of the box to be located and then press
¸. The calculator marks that corner of the box with a small
square.
3. Construct the box (as shown in the first picture in Figure 11-6).
To do so, press the ABCD keys. As you press these keys, the cal-
culator draws the sides of the box.
When you use ZoomBox, if you don’t like the size of the box, you
can use any of the ABCD keys to resize the box. If you don’t like
the location of the corner you anchored in Step 2, press N and
start over with Step 1. If you’re drawing a rather large box, to move
the cursor a large distance, press 2 and then press an appropri-
ate arrow key.

4. When you’re finished drawing the box, press ¸ and the cal-
culator redraws the graph in the viewing window specified by
the box (as shown in the second picture in Figure 11-6).
When you use ZoomBox, ¸ is pressed only two times. The
first time you press it is to anchor a corner of the zoom box.
The next time you press ¸ is when you’re finished drawing
the box and you’re ready to have the calculator redraw the graph.
 Zoom In and Zoom Out: After the graph is drawn (as I describe earlier
in this chapter), these commands allow you to zoom in on a portion of
the graph or to zoom out from the graph. They work very much like a
zoom lens on a camera. To use these commands:
1. Press „© if you want to zoom in, or press „ª if you want to
zoom out.
2. Use the ABCD keys to move the cursor to the spot on-screen
from which you want to zoom in or zoom out.
This spot becomes the center of the new viewing window.
3. Press ¸.
The graph is redrawn centered at the cursor location.
If you used a Zoom command to redraw a graph and then want to undo what
that command did to the graph, press „CCB¨ to select ZoomPrev from
the Zoom Memory menu. The graph is then redrawn as it appeared in the
previous viewing window.
Tracing polar graphs
After you graph your polar equations (as I describe earlier in this chapter),
you can have the cursor display the coordinates of the points on the graph
by tracing it. To trace a polar graph, follow these steps:
1. If necessary, set Coordinates in the Graph Formats menu to RECT or
POLAR.
Construct box
Press ¸
Figure 11-6:
Using
ZoomBox.
155
Chapter 11: Polar Equations

If you know that you are already in the rectangular or polar format,
you can skip this step. Otherwise press ƒC¸B to access the
Coordinates option in the Graph Formats menu and then press ¨ to
have the coordinates displayed in (x, y) rectangular form or press ©
for (r, θ) polar form. Press ¸ to save this setting.
2. Press … and then use B to trace the graph.
As you investigate a polar graph by tracing it, here’s what you see:
 The number of the polar equation: The number of the polar equation 
in the Y= editor that you’re tracing is displayed in the top-right corner of
the screen. For example, if you see the number 1, you’re tracing the first
polar equation (r1) in the Y= editor. If you’ve graphed more than one
equation and you would like to trace a different polar equation, repeat-
edly press C until the number of the desired equation appears. 
 The value of the parameter θ: At the bottom of the screen, you see a
value for θc. This is the value of the independent variable θ at the
cursor location. Each time you press B, the cursor moves to the next
plotted point in the graph and updates the value of θc. If you press A,
the cursor moves left to the previously plotted point. And if you press
C to trace a different polar equation, the tracing of that equation
starts at the same value of θc that was displayed on-screen before
you pressed this key.
When you’re using Trace, if you want to start tracing the graph at a spe-
cific value of the parameter θ, just key in that value and press ¸.
(The value you assign to θ must be between θmin and θmax; if it isn’t,
you get an error message.) After you press ¸, the trace cursor
moves to the point on the graph corresponding to that value of θ. But
the calculator doesn’t change the viewing window. So if you don’t see
the cursor, it’s on the part of the graph outside the viewing window. The
sidebar “Panning in Polar mode” tells you how to get the cursor and the
graph in the same viewing window.
 The coordinates of the cursor: On the last line of the screen, you see
the coordinates of the cursor location. In rectangular form, these 
coordinates are denoted by xc and yc; in polar form, they are rc
and θc.
Press N to terminate tracing the graph. This also removes the number of
the polar equation and the coordinates of the cursor from the screen.
If your cursor disappears from the screen while you’re tracing a polar graph,
the sidebar “Panning in Polar mode” tells you how to rectify this situation.
156
Part IV: Working with Sequences, Parametric Equations, and Polar Equations 

If the number of the polar equation at the top of the screen and the coordi-
nates at the bottom of the screen are interfering with your view of the graph
when you use Trace, increase the height of the window by pressing ¥„ and
decreasing the value of ymin and increasing the value of ymax.
Displaying Equations in a Table
After you’ve entered polar equations in the Y= editor (as I describe earlier in
this chapter), you can have the calculator create one of three different types
of tables of values of your polar equations:
 An automatically generated table that displays the plotted points
appearing in the calculator’s graphs of the polar equations
 An automatically generated table that displays the points using the ini-
tial θ-value and θ-increment that you specify
 A user-defined table into which you enter the θ-values of your choice and
the calculator determines the corresponding values of the polar equations
The following sections discuss these tables in greater detail.
157
Chapter 11: Polar Equations
Panning in Polar mode
When you’re tracing a polar equation and the
cursor hits an edge of the screen, if θc is less
than θmax and you continue to press B, the
coordinates of the cursor are displayed at the
bottom of the screen. However, because the
calculator doesn’t automatically adjust the
viewing window, you won’t see the cursor on
the graph. To rectify this situation, make a
mental note of the value of θc (or write it down)
and then press ¸. The calculator then
redraws the graph centered at the location of
the cursor at the time you pressed ¸. Then
press … to continue tracing the graph.
The bad news is that after the graph is redrawn
the trace cursor appears at the beginning of the
graph of the first selected polar equation
appearing in the Y= editor. To get the trace
cursor back on the part of the graph displayed
in the new viewing window, key in that value
of θc (hopefully you kept the note handy) and
then press ¸. If you weren’t tracing the
first selected equation appearing in the Y=
editor, use C to place the cursor on the graph
you were tracing. The trace cursor then
appears in the middle of the screen, and you
can use A or B to continue tracing the graph.
When θc equals θmax, pressing B has no
effect because the cursor has reached the end
of the graph.

Creating automatically generated tables
To create a table in which you specify the initial θ-value and the value by
which θ is incremented, perform the following steps:
1. Place checkmarks to the left of the equations in the Y= editor that you
want to appear in the table; leave the other equations unchecked.
Only the equations in the Y= editor that have checkmarks to the left of
their names will appear in the table. To check or uncheck an equation,
press ¥ƒ, use the CD keys to place the cursor on the equation, and
then press † to toggle between checking and unchecking the function.
2. Press ¥† to access the Table Setup editor (shown in Figure 11-7).
3. Enter a number in tblStart and press D; then enter a number in ∆tbl
and press D.
If Independent is the only item you see in the Table Setup editor, and if
the cursor is on ASK, press B¨ to change this setting to AUTO and then
press CCC to enter numbers in tblStart and ∆tbl.
tblStart is the first value of the independent variable θ to appear in the
table, and ∆tbl is the increment for the independent variable θ. The cal-
culator constructs the table by adding the value you assign to ∆tbl to
the previous θ-value and calculating the corresponding values of the
polar equations. In the first picture in Figure 11-7, tblStart is assigned
the value 0 and ∆tbl the value –π/24 to produce the decreasing values in
the θ-column of the table in the second picture in this figure.
Use the number keys to enter values in tblStart and ∆tbl. Press D after
making each entry.
4. Set Graph <–> Table to OFF (as shown in Figure 11-7).
You have two choices for the Graph <–> Table setting: OFF and ON.
When Graph <–> Table is set to ON, a table of the points plotted in the
calculator’s graphs of the equations is created. However, if Graph <–>
Table is set to OFF, the calculator uses the values in tblStart and ∆tbl to
generate the table.
Figure 11-7:
Auto-
matically
generated
tables.
158
Part IV: Working with Sequences, Parametric Equations, and Polar Equations 

To change the Graph <–> Table setting, use CD to place the cursor on
the existing setting, press B to display the options for that setting, and
press the number of the option you want.
5. Press ¸ to save the settings in the Table Setup editor.
6. If necessary, press ¥‡ to display the table.
The table appears on the screen, as illustrated in the second picture in
Figure 11-7. You find out about navigating the table later in this chapter.
To create a table of the plotted points appearing in the calculator’s graphs
of the polar equations, follow Steps 1 and 2. If Independent is the only item
you see in the Table Setup editor, press B¨ to change this setting to AUTO
and then press CB©¸ to set Graph <–> Table to ON and to save your
settings. On the other hand, if you see all four items in this editor, press
DDB©¸ to set Graph <–> Table to ON and to save your settings.
(With these settings, the calculator will ignore the other values in the Table
Setup menu.) If necessary, press ¥‡ to display the table, as shown in the
third picture in Figure 11-7.
Creating a user-defined table
To create a user-defined table in which you enter values of the parameter θ and
the calculator figures out the corresponding values of the polar equations,
follow these steps:
1. Place checkmarks to the left of the functions in the Y= editor that you
want to appear in the table; leave the other functions unchecked.
Only the functions in the Y= editor that have checkmarks to the left of
their names will appear in the table. To check or uncheck a function,
press ¥ƒ, use the CD keys to place the cursor on the function, and
then press † to toggle between checking and unchecking the function.
2. Press ¥† to access the Table Setup editor.
3. Set Independent to ASK and press ¸.
Independent is the last item in the menu. If it is already set to ASK,
press ¸ and go to the next step. If it is set to AUTO, press CCCB©
to set Independent to ASK and then press ¸.
4. If necessary, press ¥‡ to display the table. If the table contains
entries, press ƒn¸ to clear the table.
You see a table without entries, as in the first picture in Figure 11-8.
159
Chapter 11: Polar Equations

5. Enter values for the parameter θ in the first column.
You must enter values consecutively; you cannot skip any cells in the first
column of the table. To make the first entry, press ¸, use the number
keys to enter a value, and then press ¸ when you’re finished. To make
entries after the first entry, press D¸, enter a value, and then press
¸.
After you make each entry, the calculator automatically calculates the
corresponding values of the selected polar equations in the Y= editor, as
shown in the second picture of Figure 11-8.
If you see the ellipsis symbol (. . .) in the table, this means that the calculator
doesn’t have enough room to display the value in the table. To see the value
of that table entry, use the Arrow keys to place the cursor over the entry. The
value is then displayed on the command line, as illustrated in the second pic-
ture in Figure 11-8.
Displaying hidden rows and columns
To display more rows in an automatically generated table, repeatedly press
C or D. If you have constructed a table for more than three polar equations,
repeatedly press A or B to navigate through the columns of the table.
Each time the calculator redisplays a table with a different set of rows, it also
automatically resets tblStart to the value of θ appearing in the first row of the
newly displayed table. To return the table to its original state, press „ to
access the Table Setup editor and then change the value that the calculator
assigned to tblStart. Press ¸ to save the value you entered and then
press ¸ again to return to the table.
While displaying a table, you can edit the definition of a polar equation with-
out going back to the Y= editor. To do this, use the AB keys to place the
cursor in the column of the equation you want to redefine and press †. This
places the definition of the equation on the command line so that you can
edit the definition. (See Chapter 1 for more on editing expressions.) When
you’re finished with your editing, press ¸. The calculator automatically
updates the table and the edited definition of the equation in the Y= editor.

Viewing the table and the graph
on the same screen
After you graph your polar equations and generate a table, you can view the
graphs and the table on the same screen. To do so, follow these steps:
1. Press 3„Bª to vertically divide the screen.
2. Press DBz to place the table in the left screen and then press DBy
to place the graph in the right screen.
If you prefer to have the graph on the left and the table on the right, just
reverse the order of keystrokes in this step by first pressing DBy and
then pressing DBz.
3. Press ¸ to save your Mode settings.
You now see a screen similar to that in the first picture in Figure 11-9.
Notice that the right screen is empty. It appears in the next step.
4. Press 2O to toggle between the left and right screens.
The right screen is no longer empty, as in the second picture in
Figure 11-9.
In a split screen, the screen with the bold border is the active screen, and the
commands for the application in that screen appear at the top of the screen.
For example, in the second picture in Figure 11-9, the Graph screen is active.
So if you press … while in this application, you can trace the polar equations
graphed in that screen. (You find out how to trace a graph earlier in this
chapter.)
To return to FULL screen mode without making changes in the Mode menu,
just press 2N. This automatically sets the Split Screen mode on Page 2 of
the Mode menu to FULL.

Chapter 11: Polar Equations

Analyzing Polar Equations
After graphing polar equations (as I describe earlier in this chapter), you can
use the options in the ‡ Graph Math menu to find the value of the polar
equations at a specified value of θ and to evaluate derivatives (dy/dx and
dr/dθ) at a specified value of θ. The calculator will even find the equation
of a tangent to the graph at a specified point on the graph. And it will find
the length of a portion of the graph or the distance between two points
on the same curve or on different curves. This section tells you how to use
the Graph Math menu to accomplish these tasks.
Evaluating polar equations
When you trace a graph, the trace cursor doesn’t hit every point on the
graph. So tracing isn’t a reliable way of finding the value of a polar equation
at a specified value of θ. The ‡ Graph Math menu, however, contains a com-
mand that evaluates polar equations at any specified θ-value. To access and
use this command, perform the following steps:
1. Graph the polar equations in a viewing window that contains the spec-
ified value of θ. 
The graph contains a specified value of θ when that value is between
θmin and θmax in the Window editor. I tell you how to graph polar equa-
tions and set θmin and θmax earlier in this chapter.
2. If necessary, set the Graph Formats menu to display coordinates in
rectangular (x, y) form or in polar (r, θ) form.
To do this, press ƒC¸B. Press ¨ for rectangular form or press ©
for polar form. Then press ¸ to save these settings.
3. Press ‡¨ to invoke the Value command in the Graph Math menu.
4. Enter the specified value of θ.
Use the keypad to enter a value of θ that is between θmin and θmax, as
illustrated in the first picture in Figure 11-10. As you enter θ, the value of
θc at the bottom of the screen is replaced by the number you key in.
5. Press ¸ to evaluate the first polar equation.
After you press ¸, the number of the first checked polar equation in
the Y= editor appears at the top of the screen, the cursor appears on the
graph of that equation at the specified value of θ, and the coordinates of
the cursor appear at the bottom of the screen. This is illustrated in the
second picture in Figure 11-10.
162
Part IV: Working with Sequences, Parametric Equations, and Polar Equations 

6. Repeatedly press C to see the value of the other graphed polar equa-
tions at your specified value of θ.
Each time you press C, the number of the polar equation being evalu-
ated appears at the top of the screen, and the coordinates of the cursor
location appear at the bottom of the screen. This is illustrated in the
third picture in Figure 11-10.
After using the Value command to evaluate your polar equations at one value
of θ, you can evaluate them at another value of θ by keying in the new value
and pressing ¸. Pressing any function key (such as ¸ or B) after
evaluating polar equations deactivates the Value command.
If you plan to evaluate polar equations at several specified values of θ, con-
sider constructing a user-defined table of values of polar equations (as I
explain earlier in this chapter).
Finding derivatives
To find the derivative (dy/dx or dr/dθ) of a polar equation at a specified value
of θ, follow these steps:
1. Graph the polar equation in a viewing window that contains the speci-
fied value of θ.
The graph contains a specified value of θ when that value is between
θmin and θmax in the Window editor. Graphing polar equations and set-
ting θmin and θmax are explained earlier in this chapter.
2. If necessary, set the Graph Formats menu to display coordinates in
rectangular (x, y) form or in polar (r, θ) form.
To do this, press ƒC¸B. Press ¨ for rectangular form or press ©
for polar form. Then press ¸ to save these settings.
Enter θ
Press ¸

3. Press ‡{ to display the Derivatives submenu of the Graph Math
menu and then press ¨ or y to select the dy/dx or the dr/dθ option.
Instructions appear at the bottom of the screen, as illustrated in the first
picture in Figure 11-11. If these instructions interfere with your view of
the graph, create more space at the bottom of the screen by pressing
¥„ and decreasing the value of ymin. Then press ¥… to redraw the
graph and repeat Step 3 to reactivate the Derivatives option.
4. If necessary, repeatedly press C until the number of the appropriate
polar equation appears at the top of the screen.
5. Enter the value of θ at which the derivative is to be evaluated.
Use the keypad to enter a value of θ that is between θmin and θmax, as
illustrated in the first picture in Figure 11-11, in which θ is set to 5π/6. As
you enter θ, the value of θc at the bottom of the screen is replaced by
the number you key in.
6. Press ¸ to evaluate the derivative.
After pressing ¸, the cursor moves to the point on the graph corre-
sponding to the specified value of θ, and the derivative at that value
is displayed at the bottom of the screen, as in the second picture in
Figure 11-11.
Finding the distance between points
The calculator has a neat feature that draws a line between two points on the
same or different polar curves and calculates the distance between these two
points. To use this feature, follow these steps:
1. Graph the polar equations in a viewing window that displays the two
points between which you want to find the distance.
I tell you about graphing polar equations and finding an appropriate
viewing window earlier in this chapter. 
Enter θ

To do this, press ƒC¸B. Press ¨ for rectangular form or press ©
for polar form. Then press ¸ to save these settings.
3. Press ‡o to select the Distance command from the Graph Math
menu.
If the calculator instructions at the bottom of the screen interfere with
your view of the graph, create more space at the bottom of the screen
by pressing ¥„ and decreasing the value of ymin. Then press ¥… to
redraw the graph and press ‡o to reinstate the Distance command.
4. If necessary, repeatedly press C until the number of the polar equa-
tion containing the first point appears at the top of the screen.
5. Enter the value of the θ corresponding to the first point and then
press ¸.
Use the keypad to enter a value of θ that is between θmin and θmax. As
you enter θ, the value of θc at the bottom of the screen is replaced by
the number you key in. After you press ¸, the cursor moves to that
point and prompts you to enter the value of θ corresponding to the
second point, as illustrated in the first picture in Figure 11-12.
6. If the second point is on a different curve, repeatedly press C until
the number of the polar equation containing the second point appears
at the top of the screen.
The cursor jumps to the point on the other curve that is defined by the
same value θ, a line is drawn between these points, and you are
prompted to enter the second point, as illustrated in the second picture
in Figure 11-12.
7. Enter the value of θ corresponding to the second point and then press
¸.
The calculator connects the two points with a line and displays the 
distance between these points, as illustrated in the third picture in

Finding the equation of a tangent line
Not only can the calculator draw a tangent to a polar curve at a specified
value of θ, but it can also tell you the equation of that tangent. To get the cal-
culator to do this, follow these steps:
1. Graph the polar equation in a viewing window that displays the point
of tangency.
Graphing polar equations and finding an appropriate viewing window
are explained earlier in this chapter. 
2. If necessary, set the Graph Formats menu to display coordinates in
rectangular (x, y) form or in polar (r, θ) form.
To do this, press ƒC¸B. Press ¨ for rectangular form or press ©
for polar form. Then press ¸ to save these settings.
3. Press ‡CCC¸ to select the Tangent command from the Graph
Math menu.
If the calculator instructions at the bottom of the screen interfere with
your view of the graph, create more space at the bottom of the screen
by pressing ¥„ and decreasing the value of ymin. Then press ¥… to
redraw the graph and press ‡CCC¸ to reinstate the Tangent
command.
4. If necessary, repeatedly press C until the number of the polar equa-
tion containing the point of tangency appears.
5. Enter the value of θ at the point of tangency.
Use the keypad to enter a value of θ that is between θmin and θmax. As
you enter θ, the value of θc at the bottom of the screen is replaced by
the number you key in, as illustrated in the first picture in Figure 11-13.
6. Press ¸ to construct the tangent and display its equation.
The tangent appears on the graph with the cursor located at the point of
tangency, and the equation of the tangent appears at the bottom of the
screen, as illustrated in the second picture in Figure 11-13.

A tangent drawn by the Tangent command in the Graph Math menu doesn’t
automatically vanish when you use another Graph Math menu option or
when you trace the graph. To erase the tangent, press † to redraw the graph
without the tangent line.
Evaluating arc length
The Arc command in the Graph Math menu can find the length of a section
(arc) of a graphed curve when you specify the beginning and ending point of
the section. To get the calculator to find this length, follow these steps:
1. Graph the polar equation in a viewing window displaying the part of
the curve you want to measure.
I cover graphing polar equations and finding an appropriate viewing
window earlier in this chapter.
2. If necessary, set the Graph Formats menu to display coordinates in
rectangular (x, y) form or in polar (r, θ) form.
To do this, press ƒC¸B. Press ¨ for rectangular form or press ©
for polar form. Then press ¸ to save these settings.
3. Press ‡CC¸ to select the Arc command from the Graph Math
menu.
If the calculator instructions at the bottom of the screen interfere with
your view of the graph, create more space at the bottom of the screen
by pressing ¥„ and decreasing the value of ymin. Then press ¥… to
redraw the graph and press ‡CC¸ to reinstate the Arc command.
4. If necessary, repeatedly press C until the number of the appropriate
polar equation appears at the top of the screen.
5. Enter the value of θ corresponding to the first point defining arc
length and then press ¸.
Use the keypad to enter a value of θ that is between θmin and θmax. As
you enter θ, the value of θc at the bottom of the screen is replaced by
the number you key in. After you press ¸, the cursor moves to that
point and prompts you to enter the second point, as illustrated in the
first picture in Figure 11-14.
6. Enter the value of θ corresponding to the second point defining the
arc (or use the AB keys to move the cursor to that point) and press
¸.
The calculator displays the length of the arc at the bottom of the screen,
as illustrated in the second picture in Figure 11-14.
167
Chapter 11: Polar Equations

Did the calculator give you a negative value for arc length? No problem —
just take the absolute value of the answer given by the calculator to get the
true value of the arc length. (The calculator gives a negative value for arc
length when the value of θ entered to define the first point of the arc is larger
than the value of θ entered to define the second point of the arc.)

his chapter is just packed with useful information on how to get the 
calculator to perform a multitude of tasks. In addition to the main topics,
this chapter tells you how to evaluate a finite or infinite sum or product, how
to find critical points, and how to evaluate arc length. If your calculus needs
go beyond the topics that I cover in this chapter, consult Chapters 13, 14, and
15 to find out how to use the calculator to do vector calculus, graph surface
curves and contour maps, and solve and graph differential equations.
Using the Calc Menu
Do you need to find the derivative of a function? Evaluate a definite integral?
Evaluate a limit? Find the Taylor polynomial of a function? Determine the arc
length of a portion of a curve? This section tells you how to accomplish these
and other tasks.
The commands that help you do calculus are housed in the Calc menu, as
illustrated in the first two pictures in Figure 12-1. You can access this menu in
two ways: On the Home screen, press … to display the Calc menu (as shown
in the first two pictures in Figure 12-1); or, alternatively, from anywhere in the
calculator, you can press 2zCCCCB to display the MATH Calculus
menu, which is identical to the Calc menu, as illustrated in the third picture
in Figure 12-1.

Dealing with derivatives
The topics in this section tell you how to find derivatives and partial deriva-
tives and how to evaluate these derivatives at a specified value of the inde-
pendent variable.
Finding derivatives
To find a derivative, follow these steps:
1. If you aren’t already on the Home screen, press ".
" is the fourth key from the top in the left column of keys.
2. Press …¨ to select the d command from the Calc menu.
The command is placed on the command line followed by a left 
parenthesis.
You can also enter the derivative command d in an expression by press-
ing 2n.
3. Enter the function whose derivative you want to find.
I cover entering expressions in Chapter 1, and I explain creating user-
defined functions in Chapter 3.
Use p (the times key) when entering the product of two letters that rep-
resent different variables or constants. If you don’t, the calculator will
interpret the two juxtaposed letters as being a two-letter name for a
single variable. For example, to the calculator, ax2 is the square of the
single variable with the two-letter name ax; whereas a x
2
:
is viewed by
the calculator as the product of the variable a and the square of the vari-
able x.
4. Press b and enter the variable.
Derivatives are always taken with respect to a variable. This is the
variable you want to enter. For example, if you are evaluating dq
d P ,
the variable is q. I explain entering variable names (words) in 
Chapter 1.
5. Press d to close the parentheses and then press ¸ to evaluate the
derivative, as illustrated in the first picture in Figure 12-2.

Part V: Doing Calculus 

If an answer scrolls off the right side of the screen, as in the last entry in the
first picture in Figure 12-2, press C and then repeatedly press B to view the
part of the answer not appearing on the screen. To again see the beginning of
the answer, press 2A. When you finish viewing the answer, press D to
return to the command line.
Have you forgotten a rule for finding derivatives? No problem — simply use
the derivative command to get the calculator to give you that rule, as illus-
trated in the last entry in the first picture of Figure 12-2, in which the calcula-
tor displays the product rule.
Finding partial derivatives
When the calculator finds the derivative with respect to a specified variable,
it treats all other variables as being constants. So the d derivative command
can also be used to find partial derivatives. To find the partial derivative of a
function, follow the steps in the preceding section for finding a derivative. In
Step 4, use the variable for the partial derivative.
The second picture in Figure 12-2 illustrates how you can use the derivative
command to find partial derivatives. The first entry in this picture finds 
x x

Evaluating derivatives and partial derivatives
To evaluate a derivative or partial derivative at specified values of the inde-
pendent variables, follow these steps:
1. Place the derivative or partial derivative on the command line.
If you haven’t yet entered the derivative or partial derivative you want to
evaluate, enter it now. The preceding two sections tell you how to do this.
If the derivative or partial derivative was your last entry and you have
already evaluated it, press 2B to place the cursor at the end of this
entry. The calculator will also deselect the entry by unhighlighting it.
If you entered the derivative or partial derivative in the calculator before
your last entry and before clearing the screen, press M twice to clear
the command line and repeatedly press C to highlight the derivative or
partial derivative. Then press ¸ to place it on the command line.

2. Press Í to enter the with command.
Í is in the left column of keys, below the Á key.
3. Enter the name of the variable, press Á, and then enter the value of
the variable, as illustrated on the command line in the third picture in
Figure 12-2.
4. If you’re evaluating the derivative or partial derivative at more than
one independent variable, press 2znn to select the word and
from the MATH Test menu and then repeat Step 3 for the next 
variable. 
Continue to do this until you’ve entered all the variables.
5. Press ¸ to evaluate the derivative or partial derivative.
Evaluating integrals
To evaluate an indefinite integral 
f
x dx
# ^ h
or a definite integral 
f
x dx
# ^ h
,
follow these steps:
1. If you aren’t already on the Home screen, press ".
2. Press …© to select the integral command from the Calc menu.
The command is placed on the command line, followed by a left 
parenthesis.
You can also insert the integral command in an expression by pressing
2m.
3. Enter the function whose integral you want to find.
I explain entering expressions in Chapter 1. See Chapter 3 for more on
creating user-defined functions.
Use p (the times key) when entering the product of two letters that rep-
resent different variables or constants. If you don’t, the calculator will
interpret the two juxtaposed letters as being a two-letter name for a
single variable. For example, to the calculator, ax2 is the square of the
single variable with the two-letter name ax.
4. Press b and enter the variable.
Integration is always done with respect to a variable. This is the variable
you want to enter. For example, if you’re evaluating 
Pdq
#
, the variable
is q. You find out about entering variable names (words) in Chapter 1.
5. If you’re evaluating an indefinite integral (that is, there are no limits
of integration), skip this step. If you’re evaluating a definite integral,
press b and enter the lower limit of integration. Then press b and
enter the upper limit of integration.
174
Part V: Doing Calculus 

6. Press d to close the parentheses and then press ¸ to evaluate the
derivative.
This process is illustrated in the first picture in Figure 12-3. Because 
integration is done with respect to y in the first entry in this picture, the
calculator treats x as a constant. Similarly, in the last two entries, a is
treated as a constant.
When using the calculator to evaluate an indefinite integral, as in the first entry
in the first picture in Figure 12-3, the calculator doesn’t tack on the constant of
integration. In other words, the answer given by the calculator is the particular
solution you get when you set the constant of integration, C, equal to zero.
Finding arc length
The arcLen command in the Calc menu is used to find the length of the curve
f(x) between x = a and x = b. It cannot be used to find the length of a space
curve (a three-, or higher, dimensional curve), nor can it be used to find the
length of a curve expressed in polar or parametric form.
To use the arcLen command to find the length of a rectangular function of
one variable, follow all the steps (including Step 5) in the preceding section
“Evaluating integrals” with the following exception: In Step 2, press …n to
select the arcLen command from the Calc menu. This process is illustrated
in the second picture in Figure 12-3, in which the second entry in this picture
finds the length of the semicircle of radius 1.
Have you forgotten the formula for finding arc length? No problem — just
use the arcLen command to get the calculator to give you the formula, as
illustrated in the first entry in the second picture in Figure 12-3.
Evaluating limits
Do you need to evaluate a limit such as lim f
x
x
a
"
^ h or lim f
x
x " 3
^ h? Or maybe you
want to evaluate a one-sided limit like lim f
x

you how to evaluate one- and two-sided limits.

Chapter 12: Dealing with Differential and Integral Calculus

1. If you aren’t already on the Home screen, press ".
2. Press …ª to select the limit command from the Calc menu.
The command is placed on the command line followed by a left 
parenthesis.
3. Enter the function whose limit you want to find.
I detail entering expressions in Chapter 1. You find out about creating
user-defined functions in Chapter 3.
Use p (the times key) when entering the product of two letters that rep-
resent different variables or constants. If you don’t, the calculator will
interpret the two juxtaposed letters as being a two-letter name for a
single variable. For example, to the calculator, ax2 is the square of the
single variable with the two-letter name ax.
4. Press b and enter the variable.
Limits are always taken as a variable goes to a number or to ±∞. This
is the variable you want to enter. For example, if you are evaluating 
lim P
q
a
"
, the variable is q. Entering variable names (words) is explained 
in Chapter 1.
5. Press b and enter the limit of the variable.
As an example, when evaluating lim P
q
a
"
, the limit of the variable is a. If 
your limit is a one-sided limit, that will be taken care of in the next step.
For example, when evaluating lim f
x
x
a
"
-
^ h, you would enter a in this step.
To enter ∞, press ¥½.
6. If you’re evaluating a two-sided limit, such as those in the first picture
in Figure 12-4, skip this step. If you’re evaluating a one-sided limit,
press b and then enter 1 if the limit is from the right or enter –1 if the
limit is from the left.
This process is illustrated on the command lines of the last two pictures
in Figure 12-4.
7. Press d to close the parentheses and then press ¸ to evaluate the
limit, as illustrated in the pictures in Figure 12-4.
Sorry folks, but when it comes to calculating limits, you can’t always trust
the answer the calculator gives you when the function isn’t defined as a
real number on both sides of the limit. For example, in the third picture in
Figure 12-4, the calculator claims that the two-sided limit and both one-sided
limits of 
x
1
-
are zero as x approaches 1. But 
x
1
-
isn’t defined (as a real
number) for x to the left of 1. So the two-sided limit and the limit from the left
are undefined. But the calculator says they are zero. On the other hand, the
calculator gives correct answers for the two-sided and one-sided limits in
the second picture in this figure, in which the function is defined as a real
number everywhere except at the limit.

The command is placed on the command line, followed by a left 
parenthesis.
3. Enter the function whose sum or product you want to find.
Entering expressions is explained in Chapter 1. Creating user-defined
functions is explained in Chapter 3.
Use p (the times key) when entering the product of two letters that rep-
resent different variables or constants. If you don’t, the calculator will
interpret the two juxtaposed letters as being a two-letter name for a
single variable. For example, to the calculator, ax2 is the square of the
single variable with the two-letter name ax.
4. Press b and enter the variable.
In

5. Press b and enter the lower limit of the sum or product. Then press
b and enter the upper limit.
For example, the lower and upper limits of the sum 
f n

6. Press d to close the parentheses and then press ¸ to evaluate the
sum or product, as illustrated in Figure 12-5.
When calculating sums or products, if the calculator returns a sum or prod-
uct, as in the third picture in Figure 12-5, the calculator was unable to come
to a conclusion on the convergence or divergence of the sum or product. The
sum in this picture is the conditionally convergent alternating harmonic
series. But the calculator was unable to compute the sum, so it returned an
equivalent expression of the sum.

Chapter 12: Dealing with Differential and Integral Calculus

Finding max, min, and inflection points
The best way to find critical points (inflection points, maximum points, and
minimum points) is to first graph the function, as I explain in Chapter 5,
and then use the Graph Math menu to find the max, min, and inflection points,
as I explain in Chapter 7.
But if you’re interested only in the x-coordinates of the absolute maximum
and minimum points, the fMax and fMin commands in the Calc menu can find
these for you. These commands won’t always give the x-coordinates of rela-
tive maximum and minimum points, as illustrated in Figure 12-6. To use the
fMax and fMin commands on the Home screen, follow these steps:
1. Press …{ to find the x-coordinates of the minimum points or press
…m to find the x-coordinates of the maximum points. 
2. Enter the function and then press b.
3. Enter the variable of the function. 
4. Press d to close the parentheses and then press ¸.
This process is illustrated in the first picture in Figure 12-6.

Maclaurin polynomial; and when n = ∞, the infinite sum is called the Taylor
series or Maclaurin series for f(x). The Taylor and Maclaurin polynomials of
f(x) are often used to approximate the value of f(x) when x is near the center c.
Although the calculator isn’t capable of finding a Taylor or Maclaurin series
for a function f(x), it is capable of finding the nth Taylor or Maclaurin polyno-
mial provided the first n derivatives of f(x) exist at x = c. To find a Taylor or
Maclaurin polynomial, follow these steps:
1. If you aren’t already on the Home screen, press ".
2. Press …o to select the taylor command from the Calc menu.
The command is placed on the command line followed by a left 
parenthesis.
3. Enter the function.
For example, if you’re finding the Taylor or Maclaurin polynomial for ln(x),
enter the function ln(x), as illustrated in the first picture in Figure 12-7.
Entering expressions is explained in Chapter 1. Creating user-defined
functions is explained in Chapter 3.
Use p (the times key) when entering the product of two letters that rep-
resent different variables or constants. If you don’t, the calculator will
interpret the two juxtaposed letters as being a two-letter name for a
single variable. For example, to the calculator, ax2 is the square of the
single variable with the two-letter name ax.
4. Press b and enter the name of variable used in the function you
entered in the preceding step.
For example, the variable used in the function ln(x) is x, which you enter
in the calculator by pressing Ù. You find out about entering variable
names (words) in Chapter 1.
5. Press b and enter the order of the Taylor or Maclaurin polynomial.
The nth Taylor or Maclaurin polynomial has order n. The value you
enter for n must be a finite positive integer.

If you’re finding a Maclaurin polynomial, you can skip this step and go to
the next step. When you make no entry for the center by skipping this
step, as in the second picture in Figure 12-7, the calculator assumes that
the center is 0.
7. Press d to close the parentheses and then press ¸ to find the
Taylor or Maclaurin polynomial.

Chapter 12: Dealing with Differential and Integral Calculus

This process is illustrated in Figure 12-7, in which the first picture shows
the third Taylor polynomial for ln(x) centered at x = 1 and the second
picture shows the sixth Maclaurin polynomial for ex.
If the calculator is unable to find a Taylor or Maclaurin polynomial, as in
the third picture in Figure 12-7, it returns the command you entered.
This usually happens if a derivative doesn’t exist, the order specified in
Step 5 isn’t a finite positive integer, or the center specified in Step 6 isn’t
a real number.
If an answer scrolls off the right edge of the screen, as in the second pic-

Converting Coordinates
In two dimensions, points are displayed in rectangular (x, y) or polar (r, θ)
coordinates; in three dimensions, they are displayed in rectangular (x, y, z),
cylindrical (r, θ, z), or spherical (ρ, θ, φ) coordinates, as illustrated in 
Figure 12-8. Chapter 11 tells you how to convert between rectangular and polar
coordinates in two dimensions; this section tells you how to convert between
rectangular, cylindrical, and spherical coordinates in three dimensions.

Part V: Doing Calculus 

To convert between rectangular, cylindrical, and spherical coordinates,
follow these steps:
1. Enter the coordinates to be converted.
On the calculator, the coordinates of a point are surrounded by square
brackets instead of parentheses, and the coordinates are separated by
commas. Moreover, any coordinate that is an angle must be preceded by
the angle symbol, ∠, and the angle must agree with the Angle mode of
the calculator.
You enter the brackets by pressing 2b for the left bracket and 2e
for the right bracket. You enter the angle symbol by pressing 2^.
(^ is the third key from the bottom of the left column of keys.) For
example, on a calculator in Radian mode, you enter the spherical 
coordinates (4, Π/6, Π/4) by pressing 2byb2^2Ze{b
2^2Zey2e, as illustrated on the command line of the first
picture in Figure 12-9.
If you don’t know the Angle mode of your calculator, look at the
bottom of the screen where you see either RAD (as in the first picture
in Figure 12-9) or DEG (as in the second picture) indicating that you
are in Radian or Degree mode, respectively. You find out how to set
the mode in Chapter 1.
You can enter an angle in radians on a calculator that is in Degree mode
if you place the radian symbol after the angle, as illustrated on the com-
mand line in the second picture in Figure 12-9. You enter the radian
symbol by pressing 2z©©. Similarly, you can enter an angle in
degrees on a calculator that is in Radian mode by pressing 2Í to
place the degree symbol after the angle.
2. Press 2zy to access the MATH Matrix menu and then press CB
to display the Vector options menu.
3. Press z if you want to convert to rectangular coordinates, press { to
convert to cylindrical coordinates, or press m to convert to spherical
coordinates.
4. Press ¸ to convert the coordinates.
If your calculator is in Radian mode, angles are displayed in radians after
the angle symbol, as illustrated in the first picture in Figure 12-9. If it’s in
Degree mode, the angles are displayed in degrees, as in the second pic-
ture of this figure.

Chapter 12: Dealing with Differential and Integral Calculus

Dealing with Hyperbolic Functions
The commands for the hyperbolic functions are housed in the MATH
Hyperbolic menu, which you access by pressing 2zCCCB. This menu
on a calculator with an up-to-date operating system is displayed in the first pic-
ture in Figure 12-10. If on your calculator this menu looks like the second 
picture in Figure 12-10, your calculator has an out-of-date operating system,
and you don’t have access to all the hyperbolic functions and their inverses.
You can easily correct this situation by upgrading your operating system (see
Chapter 21).
You evaluate a hyperbolic function the same way you evaluate any function,
as I explain in Chapter 3. For example, to find sinh(0), press " if you
aren’t already on the Home screen, press 2zCCCB¨ to place the sinh
command on the command line, press µ to enter the argument, press d to
close the parentheses, and then press ¸ to evaluate the function. This
process is illustrated in the first entry in the third picture in Figure 12-10.
The last two entries in the third picture in Figure 12-10 show that you can
select a hyperbolic function from the MATH Hyperbolic menu and find its
derivative or integrate it.

Dealing with Vector Calculus
In This Chapter

 Evaluating dot and cross products
 Creating and recalling user-defined vector operations
T
he calculator can evaluate the dot or cross product of two vectors, find
the length of a vector, and it can find a unit vector in the same direction
as a given vector. Other than that, it doesn’t have much to offer when it
comes to working with vectors. But this chapter does: It tells you how to use
these functions and how to work around the calculator’s vector-function limi-
tations, such as finding the angle between two vectors.
Entering, Storing, and Recalling Vectors
Textbooks are inconsistent when it comes to denoting vectors: Some use
angle brackets, <v1, v2>, and others use square brackets, [v1, v2]. Your calcula-
tor uses square brackets. 
Entering vectors
To enter a vector in the calculator, follow these steps:
1. If you aren’t already on the Home screen, press ".
" is the fourth key from the top in the left column of keys.
2. Press 2b to enter the left bracket.
3. Enter the first component of the vector.
4. Press b and enter the next component of the vector.

5. Repeat Step 4 until you’ve entered all components of the vector.
6. Press 2e to close the brackets, as illustrated in the first two entries
in the first picture in Figure 13-1.
Storing vectors
If you’re going to use a vector several times, consider saving (storing) it in a
variable name such as v. Then, each time you need to use this vector, all you
have to do is enter the letter v instead of reentering the vector.
To save (store) a vector for future use, follow these steps:
1. Enter the vector. 
I explain how to do this in the preceding section.
2. Press §, the second key from the bottom in the left column of keys.
3. Give your vector a name.
To give your vector a one-letter name, press É and then press the
key with the letter above the key. For example, if you want to call your
vector v, as in the second entry in the first picture in Figure 13-1, press
Éµ because v is above the µ key. (See Chapter 1 for an explanation
on how to use the É and ¤ keys to give your vector a multi-charac-
ter name.)
4. Press ¸ to store the vector, as illustrated in the first two entries in
the first picture in Figure 13-1.
Values stored under one-letter names can cause problems down the road if
you forget they’re there. For example, if you stored the number 3 in the letter
x, the next time you use x in an expression, the calculator will replace x with
3. To avoid this problem, when you finish with the values stored under one-
letter names, press 2ƒ¨¸ to clear the values stored in all one-letter
names. If you’d like to clear all one-letter names and erase the screen, press
2ƒ©¸.

Recalling a stored vector
After storing a vector in a one-letter name, you can insert it in an expression
simply by pressing É and then pressing the key corresponding to that
letter, as illustrated in the first two pictures in Figure 13-1.
Executing Vector Operations
This section tells you how to use the four vector operations found on the 
calculator: evaluating a dot product, evaluating a cross product, finding the
length of a vector, and finding a unit vector in the same direction as a given
vector.
Finding unit vectors and evaluating
dot and cross products
The Vector operations menu housed in the MATH Matrix menu has com-
mands for finding a unit vector in the same direction as a given vector and
commands for finding the dot and cross products of vectors that have the
same dimension. To use these commands, follow these steps:
1. If you’re not on the Home screen, press ".
2. Press 2zy to display the MATH Matrix menu and then press CB to
display the Vector operations menu.
3. Press ¨ to find a unit vector, press © to evaluate a cross product, or
press ª to evaluate a dot product.
The appropriate command is placed on the command line, followed by a
left parenthesis.
4. If you’re finding a unit vector, enter one vector. If you’re evaluating a
cross or dot product, enter the first vector, press b, and then enter
the second vector.
I explain entering vectors earlier in this chapter. If you’re evaluating a dot
product, the two vectors must have the same dimension. And if you’re
evaluating a cross product, both vectors must be three-dimensional. 
5. Press d to close the parentheses and then press ¸ to execute the
command, as illustrated in the first two pictures in Figure 13-1 (shown
earlier).
185
Chapter 13: Dealing with Vector Calculus

Finding the length of a vector
The norm command, which is tucked away in the CATALOG, is used to find
the length of a vector. To use this command, follow these steps:
1. If you’re not on the Home screen, press ".
2. Select the norm command from the CATALOG.
To do this, press ½ to enter the CATALOG, and then press { to
view the items in the CATALOG beginning with the letter N. Press 2D
to view the next page in the CATALOG and repeatedly press D to place
the cursor to the left of the norm command, as illustrated in the third
picture in Figure 13-1. Then press ¸ to place this command on the
command line. The calculator supplies the left parenthesis required for
this command.
3. Enter the vector.
See “Entering vectors,” earlier in this chapter. 
4. Press d to close the parentheses and then press ¸ to execute the
command, as illustrated in the last entry in the second picture in
Figure 13-1 (shown earlier).
Creating User-Defined Vector Operations
Granted, having a calculator that can find only unit vectors, lengths of vec-
tors, and cross and dot products of vectors doesn’t give you very much
power over vector operations. But if you look at the textbook formulas for
the other vector operations, you’ll see that the calculator has everything you
need — provided you remember the formula for the vector operation you
want to execute and are willing to do a little work. 
But sometimes doing a little work isn’t convenient when you have a big prob-
lem to solve. If this is the case, I have two solutions for you:
 Install the Calculus Tools application on your calculator.
This application has many of the vector operations not found on the 
calculator — like grad, div, and curl. (Chapter 23 tells you how to down-
load and install applications.) 
186
Part V: Doing Calculus 

 Create a custom menu containing all the operations you need, as illus-
trated in the first two pictures in Figure 13-2.
Because the Calculus Tools application doesn’t have every vector 
operation I want, I have resorted to this second solution. Of course I
had to write programs for these operations, but they’re very short 
programs, as illustrated in the third picture in Figure 13-2. Appendix A
tells you how to write short programs and how to create and display
custom menus. If you’d like to use my custom menu, you can download
it (and directions on how to use it) from the Wiley Web site for this
book.

o you know how to get the calculator to draw three-dimensional graphs
on that itsy-bitsy calculator screen so they look like the graphs you see
in textbooks? And do you know how to animate a three-dimensional graph or
construct a contour map? If not, you’re looking in the right place because this
chapter tells you how.
Graphing Functions of Two Variables
This section tells you how to get your calculator to sketch the various types
of graphs of a function of two variables. Later in this chapter, I tell you how to
use the calculator to rotate and animate your graph.
To create a 3D graph of a surface, a 3D graph of level curves, or a 2D contour
map, follow these steps:
1. If you haven’t already set the Graph mode to 3D, press 2Bz¸
to do so, as illustrated in the first picture in Figure 14-1.

2. Press ¥ƒ to enter the Y= editor and then uncheck or clear any cur-
rently existing functions.
The calculator can graph only one 3D function at a time. And only the
functions in the Y= editor with checkmarks to the left of their names are
selected to be graphed, as illustrated in the second picture in Figure 14-1,
in which z2 will be graphed, but z1 won’t.
To change the checked status of a function, use the CD keys to highlight
the function and then press † to toggle the checkmark between being
displayed and not being displayed.
To clear a single function from the Y= editor, use the CD keys to high-
light the function and then press M. To clear all functions currently
in the Y= editor, press ƒn¸, as illustrated in the third picture in
Figure 14-1.
3. Enter the function you want to graph.
The function must be in the form z = f(x, y), where the two variables are
denoted by the letters x and y, as illustrated in the second picture in
Figure 14-1. You enter the letter x by pressing Ù, and you enter y by
pressing Ú.
To enter or edit the definition of a function zn, use the CD keys to place
the cursor to the right of the equal sign and press ¸ or … to place
the cursor on the command line. Then enter or edit the definition of the
function and press ¸ when you’re finished. I explain entering and
editing expressions in Chapter 1.
Because the calculator can graph only one 3D function at a time, after
completing this step, only one function in the Y= editor should appear
with a checkmark next to it. If this isn’t the case, the directions in Step 2
tell you how to rectify this situation.
4. Press ƒC¸ to display the Graph Formats menu and then select
the options of your choice.
To select options from this menu, use the CD keys to place the cursor on
the desired format, press B to display the options for that format, and
then press the number of the option you want. When you’re finished set-
ting the various formats for your graph, press ¸ to save your settings.

lator to

Part V: Doing Calculus 

An explanation of the Graph Formats menu options follows:
• Coordinates: This format allows you to choose the manner in
which the coordinates of the location of the cursor are displayed
at the bottom of the graph screen. Select RECT to display the loca-
tion of the cursor as (x, y, z) rectangular coordinates, or select
POLAR to display 3D points as (r, θ, z) cylindrical coordinates. If,
for some strange reason, you don’t want to see the coordinates of
the cursor when you trace the graph, select OFF.
• Axes: If you don’t want to see the x-, y-, and z-axes on your graph,
select OFF; if you do want to see them, select AXES. These options
are illustrated in the first two pictures in Figure 14-2. If you want to
see your graph housed in a rectangular box, as in the third picture
in Figure 14-2, select BOX.
If you change your mind about the display of the axes after graph-
ing the function, simply press ƒC¸ to display the Graph
Formats menu, change the Axes format, and press ¸. Your
graph instantly reappears with the new Axes format.
• Labels: If you want the x-, y-, and z-axes to be labeled (as in the
second two pictures in Figure 14-2), select ON; otherwise, select
OFF. My recommendation is to select ON — otherwise you don’t
know which axis is which when you rotate the graph.
• Style: The first picture in Figure 14-2 shows the WIRE FRAME style
of graphing, and the second picture shows the HIDDEN SURFACE
style. A wire frame graph is a see-through graph in the sense that
it displays surfaces normally hidden from view; a hidden surface
graph hides these surfaces and adds a little shading. Most textbook
pictures of 3D graphs are displayed in the hidden surface style.
Select the CONTOUR LEVELS option if you want a 3D graph of the
level curves, as in the first picture in Figure 14-3, or a 2D contour
map, as in the second picture in this figure. Creating custom level
curves and contour maps, in which you get to specify which
curves appear on the graph, is explained later in this chapter.
As illustrated in the third picture of Figure 14-3, the WIRE AND
CONTOUR style of graphing is a composite of the wire frame and
contour level styles.

Chapter 14: Graphing Surfaces and Contour Maps

The IMPLICIT PLOT style isn’t used to produce 3D graphs; it’s
used to produce a 2D graph of an implicitly defined function of
one variable. For example, you can use it to graph the ellipse
implicitly defined by the equation x2 + 4y2 + 4x – 8y = 8. The
sidebar in this chapter, “Graphing implicitly defined functions,”
tells you how to do this.
5. If you know the viewing window you want for your graph, go to Step 6.
If you haven’t the slightest idea what the graph looks like, press „{
(ZoomStd) to graph the function in the Standard viewing window. If
you’re satisfied with the graph, skip the remaining steps. If you’d like
to see more of the graph on the z-axis, press „CCC¸ (ZoomFit).
If you’re satisfied with the graph, skip the remaining steps. If you’d like
to fine-tune the window to get a better view of your graph, the next
step tells you how to do this.
ZoomStd graphs the function in the Standard viewing window, in which
the x-, y-, and z-coordinates are each between –10 and 10. The first two
pictures in Figure 14-5 show the settings of this window, and the first pic-
ture in Figure 14-4 displays the graph of z = y2 – x2 in this window. 
ZoomFit uses the existing limits in the Window editor for the x- and 
y-coordinates to determine the limits for the z-coordinates needed to
display a full graph, as illustrated in the second picture in Figure 14-4. 
If you were expecting to see a 2D contour map after completing Step 5
but instead see a 3D graph of the level curves, go to the next step and
set eyeθ = –90, eyeφ = 0, and eyeψ = 0.
You can save some time when you don’t know what the 3D graph of a
function looks like: Set the first nine items in the Window editor to the
values appearing in the first picture of Figure 14-5 and then press
„CCC¸ to execute the ZoomFit command. This procedure
saves time by eliminating the need to have the calculator first graph
the function in the Standard viewing window, but on the down side, it
requires that you remember the first nine Window settings for the
Standard viewing window. (You find out about setting the Window in
the next step.)

6. Press ¥„ to access the Window editor. After each of the window
variables, enter a numerical value that is appropriate for the function
you’re graphing. Press ¸ or D to move to the next variable.
The first two pictures in Figure 14-5 show the Window editor when the
calculator is in 3D Graph mode. The items in this menu determine the
viewing window for your graph. The following gives an explanation of
the variables you must set in this editor:
• eyeθ, eyeφ, and eyeψ: These are the angles that orient the coordi-
nate system so that you get the best view of your graph. If you
don’t know what the best orientation is (which is usually the case),
set eyeθ = 20, eyeφ = 70, and eyeψ = 0 if you are drawing a 3D
graph. Set eyeθ = –90, eyeφ = 0, and eyeψ = 0 if you’re creating a 2D
contour map. After you graph your function, you can manually
rotate it to get a better view of the graph. I explain how to do this
later in this chapter. 
The third picture in Figure 14-5 displays the location of the angles
θ, φ, and ψ. Angle θ is an angle in the xy-plane measured from the
positive x-axis, and angle φ is an angle measured from the positive
z-axis. These two angles determine the line of sight from your eye
to the origin of the coordinate system. Angle ψ rotates the graph
around this line of sight. If you want to, you can fine-tune the angle
settings. To change the value of one of these angles, enter the
degree value of the angle even if your calculator is in Radian mode.
Do not place the degree symbol after this value.
• xmin, xmax, ymin, and ymax: These are, respectively, the smallest
and largest values of x in view on the x-axis and the smallest and
largest values of y in view on the y-axis.

Chapter 14: Graphing Surfaces and Contour Maps

• xgrid and ygrid: These settings determine the number of wires in
the x- and y- directions used to display the 3D graph, as illustrated
in Figure 14-6. Setting each of these to numbers between 14 and 20
is recommended. Fewer than 14 wires in either direction might not
give you a very good idea of the shape of the graph. And if you
have a lot more than 20 wires, the calculator takes a long time to
graph the function, and the resulting graph is almost solid black.
The default setting is 14 for each of these, as illustrated in the
second picture in Figure 14-4.
• zmin and zmax: These are, respectively, the smallest and largest
values of z in view on the z-axis. 
If you have assigned values to xmin, xmax, ymin, and ymax, but
don’t know what values to assign to zmin and zmax, press
„CCC¸ to invoke the ZoomFit command. This command
uses the xmin, xmax, ymin, and ymax settings to determine the
settings for zmin and zmax needed to display a full graph, and
then it automatically draws the graph.
• ncontour: This setting determines the number of level curves that
will be graphed when the graph style is set to CONTOUR LEVELS
or WIRE AND CONTOUR, as I explain in Step 4. The default setting
of 5 produces five level curves, as illustrated earlier in Figure 14-3.
A setting between 5 and 10 is ideal. When there are fewer than 5
level curves, discerning the shape of the graph might be difficult,
as in the first picture in Figure 14-7. And when there are more than
10 level curves, distinguishing between these curves might be
tricky, as in the third picture in this figure.
If you want to create custom level curves or contour maps in which
you specify which curves appear on the graph, set ncontour to 0 so
no curves appear on the graph. I explain how to then graph your
custom level curves or contour map later in this chapter, in the sec-
tion “Creating Custom Level Curve Graphs and Contour Maps.”

If the calculator takes too long to draw a 3D graph and you’d like to abort the
process, press ´.
After graphing your function, you can always return to the Window editor
and change any of your settings. To do this, press ¥„ to display the
Window editor, make the changes you want, and then press ¥… to redraw
the graph in the new window. It might take the calculator awhile to perform
some calculations before it displays the graph. 
Changing the Display of a Graph
You can change the way a graph is displayed by zooming in on the graph to
get a better view of a small portion of it, or by zooming out to get a global pic-
ture. You can also change the display by rotating the graph or by changing
the Graph style. And you can change the way you see the graph by looking at
it along a coordinate axis. This section tells you how to do these things.
Zooming in and out
After graphing a function of two variables, which I explain earlier in this chap-
ter, you can zoom in on a portion of the graph or zoom out from the graph.
This works very much like a zoom lens on a camera.
To zoom in or out while on the Graph screen, press „© to zoom in or press
„ª to zoom out. Then use the ABCD keys to move the cursor to the spot
on the screen from which you want to zoom in or zoom out. Then press
¸. The graph is redrawn centered at the cursor location. After zooming in
or out, you might want to adjust the settings in the viewing window to get a
better view of the graph. To do this, press ¥„ to display the Window editor,
make the changes you want, and then press ¥… to redraw the graph in the
new window.

Chapter 14: Graphing Surfaces and Contour Maps

This process is illustrated in Figure 14-8. The first picture in this figure is the
original graph, and the second picture is the result of zooming out from the
origin. The third picture is the zoomed-out graph in an adjusted viewing
window.
If you used a Zoom command to redraw a graph and then want to undo what
that command did to the graph, press „CCB¨ to select ZoomPrev from
the Zoom Memory menu. This command redraws the graph as it appeared
in the previous viewing window.
A quick way to zoom in on a graph from the center of the graph is to press p
(the times sign) to see the graph in what is called expanded view, as illus-
trated in Figure 14-9. To return to the original graph, press p again to see the
graph in the normal view.
Rotating a 3D graph
You can use the Arrow keys to rotate a graph: A and B rotate the graph hori-
zontally, to the left and to the right, respectively; C and D rotate the graph
vertically.
If you want to put a graph back in its original position after using the Arrow
keys to rotate it, press µ.

Animating a 3D graph
To make your graph move continuously in one direction, press and hold the
appropriate Arrow key until the graph starts moving. For example, if you
press and hold A, the graph will continuously rotate horizontally in the
clockwise direction.
When the graph is rotating, you can press and hold a different Arrow key to
change the direction of rotation. To stop the animation, press ¸. To
return the graph to its original position, press µ.
Viewing a graph along a coordinate axis
The first picture in Figure 14-10 displays the graph of a saddle curve. The
second picture shows what this saddle looks like when you view it by looking
directly down the x-axis, and the third picture shows what it looks like when
viewed along the y-axis.
You can view any 3D graph along any of the three coordinate axes by pressing
the key corresponding to the letter of that axis. For example, press Ù to view
the graph along the x-axis, and then press Ú to see the view along the y-axis.
To return the graph to its original view, press µ.
Pressing Û to view a 3D graph of level curves along the z-axis is a quick way
of converting the graph to a contour map, as illustrated in the first two pic-
tures in Figure 14-11.
After viewing a 3D graph along a coordinate axis, you can press p (the times
sign) to enlarge the view, as illustrated in the last picture in Figure 14-11. To
return the graph to the previous view along the coordinate axis, press p
again.

Chapter 14: Graphing Surfaces and Contour Maps

Changing the style of a 3D graph
After creating a 3D graph (see “Graphing Functions of Two Variables” earlier in
this chapter), you can easily change its graphing style by repeatedly pressing
Í to cycle the graph style through the four possible graphing styles: WIRE
FRAME, HIDDEN SURFACE, CONTOUR LEVELS, and WIRE AND CONTOUR.
Figure 14-12 illustrates what the 3D graph in the first picture in Figure 14-8
looks like in different graph styles. Because the function in Figure 14-8 was
initially graphed in the HIDDEN SURFACE style, pressing Í displays the graph
in the next style, which is the CONTOUR LEVELS style (the first picture in
Figure 14-12). Pressing Í again displays it in the WIRE AND CONTOUR style
(the second picture in Figure 14-12), and pressing Í a third time displays the
graph in the WIRE FRAME style (the third picture). Pressing Í a fourth time
takes you back to the HIDDEN SURFACE style of the initial graph.
If you originally graphed your function in the WIRE FRAME or HIDDEN SUR-
FACE style of graphing, the calculator takes a few moments to evaluate the
contours needed to change the graph style to the CONTOUR LEVELS or WIRE
AND CONTOUR style of graphing.
Tracing a 3D Graph
If your 3D graph is graphed with the WIRE FRAME, HIDDEN SURFACE, or WIRE
AND CONTOUR style of graphing, as I describe in the preceding section, you
can press … (Trace) and then use the Arrow keys to get the calculator to
show the coordinates of the points on the wire frame used to display the

graph. Although the calculator cannot trace the level curves in the CONTOUR
LEVELS style of graphing, you can press Í to convert such a graph to the
WIRE AND CONTOUR style so the calculator can trace the wire frame.
To trace a WIRE FRAME, HIDDEN SURFACE, or WIRE AND CONTOUR style
graph, press … and then use the Arrow keys to move the cursor along the
wire frame that constitutes the graph. Here’s how the Arrow keys move:
 A and B: These keys move the cursor from lattice point to lattice point
in the direction of the x-axis, with B moving in the positive x direction
and A moving in the negative x direction. When the x-coordinate of the
cursor location is xmin, pressing A produces no movement in the cursor
because the calculator hasn’t computed the points on the graph when
the x-coordinate is less than xmin. Similarly, when the x-coordinate of the
cursor location is xmax, pressing B results in no movement.
 C or D: These keys move the cursor from lattice point to lattice point in
the direction of the y-axis, with C moving in the positive y direction and
D moving in the negative y direction. When the y-coordinate of the cursor
location is ymin, pressing D produces no movement in the cursor
because the calculator hasn’t computed the points on the graph when
the y-coordinate is less than ymin. In the same way, when the y-coordinate
of the cursor location is ymax, pressing C does not move the cursor.
The following list describes what you see as you trace a graph:
 The number of the function: The number of the function in the Y=
editor that you’re tracing is displayed in the top-right corner of the
screen. For example, if you see the number 3, you’re tracing the third
graph (z3) in the Y= editor.
 The values of x, y, and z: At the bottom of the screen, you see the 
coordinates that define the cursor location displayed in either rectangu-
lar (x, y, z) or polar (r, θ, z) form with, for example, the rectangular 
x-coordinate denoted by xc or the polar r-coordinate denoted by rc. If no
number appears after zc, the function isn’t defined as a real number at
the values displayed for xc and yc.
Press M to terminate tracing the graph. This also removes the number of
the function and the coordinates of the cursor from the screen.
When you’re using Trace, if you want to start tracing your function at a spe-
cific value of the independent variables x and y, just key in that value for x,
press ¸, key in that value for y, and press ¸. (The value you assign
to x must be between xmin and xmax, and the value you assign to y must
be between ymin and ymax; if they aren’t, you get an error message.) After
you press ¸, the trace cursor moves to the point on the graph that has
the x- and y-coordinates you just entered. If that point isn’t on the portion of
the graph appearing on the screen, press ¸ to center the graph at the
cursor location. Then press … to continue tracing the graph.

Chapter 14: Graphing Surfaces and Contour Maps

Creating Custom Level Curve
Graphs and Contour Maps
A customized graph of level curves lets you specify which level curves
appear in your 3D graph. And a customized contour map is simply a projec-
tion onto the xy-plane of a customized graph of level curves. To create either
type of graph, follow these steps:
1. Graph the function containing the level curves.
Graphing the function first ensures that you have an appropriate viewing
window for the level curves or contour map you will graph in the follow-
ing steps. For example, to produce the graphs of custom level curves
and contour maps in Figures 14-13 and 14-14, I first graphed the function
z = y2 – x2 as it appears in the second picture in Figure 14-4.
The first section in this chapter explains how to graph a function of two
variables. 
2. If you haven’t already done so, set the Graph style to CONTOUR
LEVELS.
To do this, press ƒC¸ to enter the GRAPH FORMATS menu, press
DDDB to display the Style menu, press ª to select CONTOUR LEVELS,
and then press ¸ to save your setting.
3. Press ¥„ to enter the Window editor and set eyeθ = 20 and eyeφ =
70 if you are graphing custom 3D level curves, or set eyeθ = –90 and
eyeφ = 0 if you are graphing a custom 2D contour map. Then set eyeψ
= 0 and ncontour = 0. Leave the other entries as they are.
eyeθ, eyeφ, and eyeψ are the first three items in the Window editor, and
ncontour is the last item. I explain setting the Window in Step 6 in the
section “Graphing Functions of Two Variables,” earlier in this chapter.
If you want to see both the level curves graph and the contour map, set
the “eye” settings for a graph of 3D level curves. In the following section,
I tell you how to quickly convert between these two types of graphs.
4. Press ¥… to display the graph of the coordinate axes.
If you set the Window for a 3D graph, you see a screen similar to the first
picture in Figure 14-13. If you set the Window for a 2D contour map, you
see the x- and y-axes with z at the origin if labels are displayed.
Pressing p toggles the size of the picture on your calculator’s screen
between large and small. For example, if what you see on the screen
looks much larger than what you see in the first picture in Figure 14-13,
press p. Press p again to return the screen to the original size.

If axis labels aren’t displayed, press ƒC¸DDB©¸ if you want
to display them.
5. Press 2ƒn to select the DrwCtour command from the Draw menu.
The calculator places the DrwCtour command on the command line of
the Home screen, as illustrated in the second picture in Figure 14-13.
The DrwCtour and Draw Contour commands in the Graph Draw menu
both draw a contour or level curve on your graph, but they’re used in
different situations. To draw the level curve passing through the point
(x, y, z), you use the DrwCtour command when you know the value of
the z-coordinate, and you use the Draw Contour command when you
know the values of the x- and y-coordinates. 
6. Enter the z-value of the level curve or contour you want to graph. To
graph more than one level curve or contour, enter the z-values sur-
rounded by braces and separated by commas, as illustrated in the
second picture in Figure 14-13. Then press ¸ to graph the level
curves or contours. 
Graphing level curves is illustrated in the third picture in Figure 14-13.
A level curve or contour of the 3D function z = f(x, y) is a 2D graph of 
f(x, y) = c (or equivalently z = c) where c is a constant. When the 2D
graph f(x, y) = c is graphed as a 3D level curve, it is graphed in the z = c
plane; when it is graphed as a contour in a 2D contour map, it is graphed
in the xy-plane. You enter these constants c (the z-values) in this step. 
For example, the third picture in Figure 14-13 displays the 3D level
curves z = 3, z = 5, and z = 8 for the 3D function z = y2 – x2. The level
curve z = 3, for example, is the 2D curve y2 – x2 = 3 graphed in the z = 3
plane. The third picture in Figure 14-14 displays these same curves, plus
another curve that was added later, graphed in a custom contour map.
Press 2c to enter a left brace and 2d to enter a right brace.
The section later in this chapter titled “Graphing a level curve or contour
that passes through a specified point” tells you how to graph a level curve
when you don’t know its z-value.

After graphing custom level curves or contours, you can add more level
curves or contours to the graph by repeating Steps 5 and 6.
Converting between level curves 
and contour maps 
To convert a 3D graph of level curves to a 2D contour map, simply press Û
to view the graph along the z-axis, as illustrated in the second picture in
Figure 14-11. You can then toggle the size of the screen display between small
and large by pressing p, as illustrated in the third picture in this figure. And
pressing µ returns you to the 3D graph of level curves.

Graphing implicitly defined functions
A function in one variable is implicitly defined
when it is not written explicitly in the form y =
f(x). Most equations of conic sections, such as
the ellipse x2 + 4y2 + 4x – 8y = 8, are implicitly
defined functions. Such functions cannot be
graphed in Function Graph mode, but they can
be graphed in 3D Graph mode. Here’s how you
graph implicitly defined functions:
1. If necessary, press 3Bz¸ to put
the calculator in 3D Graph mode.
2. Press ¥ƒ to enter the Y= editor and then
uncheck any existing functions by using
the CD keys to highlight the function and
pressing †.
3. Use the CD keys to highlight an unde-
fined function and press ¸. Set the
implicitly defined equation equal to zero
and key in the nonzero side of the equation.
Then press ¸ to save this definition in
the Y= editor.
4. Press ƒC¸ to display the Graph
Formats menu and press DDDBz to
select the Implicit Plot style. Then press
¸ to save your settings.
5. Press ¥„ to enter the Window editor and
set xmin, xmax, ymin, and ymax to the
values of your choice. (If you don’t know
what settings to use, press „{ to use the
Standard viewing window and skip the next
step.) Leave the other settings as they are.
6. Press ¥… to graph the function.
After graphing the implicitly defined function,
you can, if you so desire, press ¥„ and adjust
the settings for xmin, xmax, ymin, and ymax.
Then press ¥… to re-graph the function.

To convert a 2D contour map to a 3D graph of level curves, press ¥„, set
eyeθ = 20, eyeφ = 70, and eyeψ = 0 and then press ¥… to display the 3D graph
of level curves.
Graphing a level curve or contour that
passes through a specified point 
If you don’t know the z-value of the level curve or contour you want to graph,
but you do know the x- and y-coordinates of a point on the level curve or con-
tour, here’s how you graph that level curve or contour:
1. Follow Steps 1 through 4 in the previous section, “Creating Custom
Level Curve Graphs and Contour Maps.”
2. Press 2ƒm to select the Draw Contour command from the Draw
menu.
The Contour At? instruction appears at the bottom of the screen, as illus-
trated in the first picture in Figure 14-14. The number in the upper-right
corner of the screen is the number of the function in the Y= editor that
the calculator will use to graph the level curve or contour you specify in
the next step.
3. Enter the x-coordinate of the point and then press ¸, as illustrated
in the second picture in Figure 14-14.
4. Enter the y-coordinate of the point and press ¸.
The calculator, after taking a few moments to calculate the contour, dis-
plays the level curve or contour on the graph, as illustrated in the third
picture in Figure 14-14, where the level curve through the point (3, 2, z)
is added to the graph in the third picture from Figure 14-13.

I
f you’ve ever solved a linear system of ordinary differential equations
(ODEs) by hand, you’re going to love how quickly you can solve such a
system with the calculator. And what about that painstaking task of graphing
a slope field by hand — wouldn’t you rather have the calculator do that for
you? If so, this chapter is for you.
Solving Ordinary Differential Equations
The deSolve command in the Calc menu is used to solve first and second
order ordinary differential equations (ODEs). It is capable of finding general
solutions, particular solutions, solutions to initial value problems, and 
solutions to boundary value problems. In the following two sections, I
tell you how to get the deSolve command to find these different types of 
solutions.
Although the deSolve command is capable of solving only first and second
order ODEs, you aren’t left high and dry when it comes to solving higher
order ODEs. The sidebar in this chapter, “Dealing with ODEs of large order,”
tells you how to convert an nth order ODE to a system of n first order ODEs.
Later in this chapter, in the section “Solving Linear Systems of ODEs,” I tell
you how to solve the resulting system of first order ODEs.

Finding the general solution to an ODE
The general solution to the first order ODE dx
dy
x
2
=
is y = x2 + C, where C is an 
arbitrary real number. When you substitute a number for C, you get a particu-
lar solution to the ODE — for example, y = x2 + 2. But in real-world applica-
tions, you usually can’t find particular solutions by simply replacing C with a
number; instead, you find them by specifying an initial condition. For exam-
ple, one initial condition that gives the particular solution y = x2 + 2 is y(0) = 2;
another is y(1) = 3. When you specify an initial condition, the problem is
called an initial value problem. An example of a first order initial value 
problem is dx
dy
x
2
=
, y(1) = 3.
In this section, I tell you how to find the general solution to a first or second
order ODE, and in the next section, I tell you how to find a particular solution
by specifying the initial conditions. Here are the steps you use to find the
general solution:
1. If you aren’t already on the Home screen, press ".
2. Press 2ƒ¨¸ to clear any numbers stored in the letters a
through z, or press 2ƒ©¸ to clear these numbers and also
clear the Home screen.
If, for example, the number 5 is stored in the letter t and you then use
the letter t when defining your differential equation, the calculator will
replace t with the number 5. Because we don’t always remember what is
stored in which letters, clearing the contents of these letters is always a
good idea.
3. Press …C¸ to place the deSolve command on the command line.
4. Enter the differential equation, as illustrated in the first picture in
Figure 15-1.
The calculator requires that derivatives be denoted by using the prime 
symbol ('). For example, on the calculator, dx
dy is denoted by y'. Press 
2Á to enter the prime symbol used to denote the first derivative;
press 2Á2Á to enter the double prime needed to denote the
second derivative.
Don’t use juxtaposition to denote multiplication — use the p key. The
expression xy', in which x and y' are juxtaposed, is interpreted by the
calculator as the derivative of the single variable having the two-letter
name xy. It also interprets y(x + 2) as the function y evaluated at x + 2.
5. Press b and enter the independent variable. Then press b and enter
the dependent variable.
When, for example, the derivative is denoted by dx
dy , the independent
variable is x and the dependent variable is y.
206
Part V: Doing Calculus 

6. Press d to close the parentheses and then press ¸ to find the gen-
eral solution to the differential equation, as illustrated in the first two
pictures in Figure 15-1.
Textbooks use C1, C2, C3, and so on, to denote constants of integration;
your calculator uses @1, @2, @3, and so on. Each time the calculator
needs a new constant of integration, it changes the value of the integer
after the @ symbol. As an example, the general solution to the differen-
tial equation in the second entry in the first picture in Figure 15-1 is dis-
played in a textbook as y = C1e3x + C2ex/3.
If the calculator displays the general solution in implicit form, as in the
first entry in the second picture in Figure 15-1, you can use the solve
command in the Algebra menu to find, if possible, the explicit form of
the general solution. When the calculator can’t write the general solu-
tion in explicit form, it at least displays the solution in a more meaning-
ful form, as in the last entry in the second picture in Figure 15-1.
To use the solve command after the calculator has given the general
solution in implicit form, press „¨ to enter the solve command on the
command line and then press 2· to tell the calculator that the equa-
tion you want to solve is the previous answer (the implicit form of the
general solution). Then press b and enter the dependent variable.
Finally, press d to close the parentheses, and press ¸ to solve for
the dependent variable, as illustrated in the second entry in the second
picture in Figure 15-1.
The next section tells you how to find particular solutions to a first or second
order differential equation. But with a first order equation, it is sometimes
faster to use the with command to solve for the constant of integration and
then plug that solution into the general solution. To solve for the constant of
integration after finding the general solution to a first order differential equa-
tion, follow these steps:
1. Press 2· to tell the calculator that you want to evaluate the last
answer (the general solution) and then press Í to enter the with 
command. 
2. Key in the name of one of the variables, press Á, and key in the value
you want to assign to that variable. 
Figure 15-1:

and second

3. Press 2znn to enter the word and.
4. Finally, key in the name of the other variable, press Á, key in the value
you want to assign to that variable, and press ¸ to evaluate the con-
stant of integration, as illustrated in the third picture in Figure 15-1.
Solving initial value and boundary
value problems
The general solution of a second order ODE y'' = f(x, y, y') has the form y =
C1y1(x) + C2y2(x), where C1 and C2 are real numbers and y1 and y2 are functions
of x. Because there are two constants of integration, namely C1 and C2, you
need to supply the calculator with two pieces of information so it can find the
particular solution you want. When those two pieces of information are in the
form y(a) = b and y'(a) = c, the problem is called an initial value problem. But
when the two pieces of information are in the form y(a) = b and y(c) = d, it’s
called a boundary value problem. To solve an initial value or boundary value
problem, follow these steps:
1. Follow steps 1 through 4 in the preceding section to place the deSolve
command on the command line and to enter the differential equation.
If you have already found the general solution to the differential equa-
tion, to find a particular solution, you can simply edit the command that
generated the general solution. To do this, press M twice to erase
the command line, use the C key to highlight the deSolve statement
used to find the general solution, and then press ¸ to place that
statement on the command line. Use the B key to place the cursor after
the definition of the differential equation and before the comma, follow
the directions in Steps 2 and 3 in this step list, and then press ¸ to
find the particular solution. You can safely skip Step 4.
2. Press 2znn to select the word and from the MATH Test menu and
enter the first initial condition or boundary value.
When the dependent variable is denoted by y, for example, the initial
condition or boundary value is entered in the form y(a) = b, as illus-
trated on the command line in the first picture in Figure 15-2.
3. If you’re finding a particular solution to a second order differential
equation, press 2znn to select the word and from the MATH Test
menu and enter the second initial condition or boundary value. If
you’re finding a particular solution to a first order differential equa-
tion, skip this step.
If you’re solving an initial value problem and the dependent variable is
denoted by y, for example, you must enter the second initial condition in
the form y'(a) = c, where the value a of the independent variable is the
208
Part V: Doing Calculus 

same value of the independent variable you used in Step 2. If it isn’t, you
get an error message. Entering this second initial condition is illustrated
on the command line of the second picture of Figure 15-2.
As illustrated in the third picture of Figure 15-2, when you’re solving a
boundary value problem, you enter the second boundary value in the
form y(c) = d, where the value c of the independent is not the same as the
value of the independent variable you used in Step 2.
4. Follow Steps 5 and 6 in the preceding section to first tell the calculator
the names of the independent and dependent variables and to then
find the particular solution to your differential equation, as illustrated
in Figure 15-2.
Solving Linear Systems of ODEs
In this section, I tell you how to use matrix methods to solve a linear system
of first order differential equations. But before doing this, you need to under-
stand the terminology and notation I use — it’s standard textbook terminol-
ogy and notation, so if I don’t go into enough detail, feel free to consult any
textbook on differential equations.
The first two systems of equations displayed in Figure 15-3 are first order sys-
tems because they use only the first derivatives of the functions x and y. And
they’re linear because the coefficients of these functions are real numbers. The
first system in this figure is called homogeneous because there are no nonzero
constant terms in the equations in the system. The second system is nonhomo-
geneous because the equations in the system contain nontrivial constant
terms. The third system of equations in this figure displays the general form of
a first order, nonhomogeneous, linear system of two differential equations. This
general form is expressed in matrix form by x'(t) = Ax(t) + g(t), where

Solving first order homogeneous systems
In matrix form, a first order homogeneous linear system of n differential equa-
tions is expressed as x'(t) = Ax(t), where A is an n × n matrix having real
number entries. The general solution to this system is x(t) = c1x1(t) + c2x2(t) +
. . . + cnxn(t), where c1, c2, . . . , cn are constants and x1(t), x2(t), . . . , xn(t) are n
linearly independent solutions to the system. 
As an example, when matrix A has n distinct real eigenvalues ω1, ω2, . . . , ωn,

where vi is an eigenvector associated with the eigenvalue ωi. The next section
tells you how to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix A, and the
four sections after that tell you how to use these eigenvalues and eigenvec-
tors to find n linearly independent solutions xi(t) to the homogeneous
system.
Finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors
You use the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix A to find the linearly
independent solutions to the homogeneous system x'(t) = Ax(t). To find the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A, follow these steps:
1. Press 3 and set the Angle mode to Radian, the Complex Format
mode to Rectangular, and the Vector Format mode to Rectangular.
Then press ¸ to save these settings and exit the Mode menu.
See Chapter 1 for details on setting the mode.
2. Enter and store the coefficient matrix A in the calculator.
If A is bigger than a 3 × 3 matrix, using the Data Matrix editor to store A
in the calculator is easier. Chapter 16 tells you how to do this. 
x' = 4x + 2y
y' = 3x − y
x' = 4x + 2y − 15e−2t
y' = 3x − y − 4e−2t
x' = a11x + a12y + g1(t)
y' = a21x + a22y + g2(t)

Matrices that are entered on the Home screen must be enclosed in
square brackets, as illustrated on the command line of the first picture
in Figure 15-4. The elements in the rows of the matrix are separated by
commas, and the rows are delineated by semicolons. You enter the
square brackets by pressing 2b and 2e, and you enter the semi-
colon by pressing 2o. After entering your matrix, press §É,
press the key that corresponds to the letter you want to use to name
your matrix, and then press ¸ to store the matrix.
The matrix in the first picture in Figure 15-4 is the coefficient matrix of
the homogeneous system of equations in Figure 15-3.
3. If you entered A in the Data Matrix editor, press " to return to the

4. Press 2zyo to select the eigVl (eigenvalue) command from the
MATH Matrix menu.
The calculator places the command on the command line, followed by a
left parenthesis.
After pressing 2zy to enter the MATH Matrix menu, you can repeat-
edly press D to highlight the eigVl command and then press ¸ to
place it on the command line.
5. Press É and then press the key that corresponds to the letter of
the name you gave your matrix in Step 2. Then press d to close the

6. Press §É and then press the key that corresponds to the letter
you want to use to name the list of eigenvectors the calculator is about
to find. (Don’t use the same letter you used in Step 2.)
You might need to reference this list of eigenvectors later, so it’s a good
idea to save it in a one-letter name now.
7. Press ¸ to find the eigenvalues of your matrix, as illustrated in the
first entry in the second picture in Figure 15-4.
The eigenvalues appear enclosed in braces; unfortunately, they’re sepa-
rated by spaces instead of commas. The first entry in the second picture
in Figure 15-4 shows that the eigenvalues of the homogeneous system in
Figure 15-3 are 5 and –2.

8. Press 2zyÉÁ to select the eigVc (eigenvector) command from
the MATH Matrix menu, repeat Step 5 to enter the name of the coeffi-
cient matrix, and then press d to close the parentheses.
9. Press §É and then press the key that corresponds to the letter
you want to use to name the eigenvector matrix. (Don’t use the same
letters you used in Steps 2 and 6.)
You might need to reference this matrix later, so it’s a good idea to save
it in a one-letter name now.
10. Press ¸ to find the eigenvectors, as illustrated in the last entry in
the second picture in Figure 15-4.
The eigenvectors are displayed in a matrix. The first column of this
matrix is the eigenvector associated with the first eigenvalue found in
Step 7. The second column is the eigenvector associated with the
second eigenvalue found in Step 7, and so on.
Eigenvectors aren’t unique. In fact, any multiple of an eigenvector is also
an eigenvector. The next step shows you how to use this fact to express
your eigenvectors in a more meaningful form.
11. Express the components of an eigenvector as integers (where possi-
ble) by dividing the eigenvector matrix you found in Step 10 by the
component in that eigenvector with the smallest absolute value, as
illustrated in the third picture in Figure 15-4. Save each result in a dif-
ferent one-letter name. 
As an example, the first eigenvector in the eigenvector matrix in the
second picture in Figure 15-4 is in the first column of this matrix. The
entry in this column with the smallest absolute value is 0.447214. This is
the number you want to divide the eigenvector matrix by in order to
express the components of the first eigenvector as integers, as illus-
trated in the first entry in the third picture in this figure.
You don’t actually have to key in the value of the component in the
eigenvector that has the smallest absolute value — you can use the
format MatrixName[row, column] to reference it by its row and column
placement in the eigenvector matrix you found in Step 10. As an exam-
ple, because 0.447214 is in the 2nd row, 1st column of eigenvector matrix
v, the command that divides this matrix by 0.447214 is v/v[2,1]. The key-
strokes that enter this command and store it in the one-letter name u are
ÉµeÉµ2b©b¨2e§É«¸, as illustrated in
the first entry in the third picture in Figure 15-4.
You might need to repeat this process for each eigenvector (column) in
the matrix you found in Step 10. For example, the component with the
smallest absolute value in the second eigenvector in matrix v (see the
second picture of Figure 15-4) is in the 1st row, 2nd column. Executing
the command v/v[1, 2] divides the matrix by this entry, resulting in a
more meaningful expression of this eigenvector, as illustrated in the
second entry of the third picture in this figure.

If you want to use the solution to solve an initial value problem, store the
solution matrix for the homogeneous system in the calculator. And if you
want to use the solution to the homogeneous system to solve a nonhomoge-
neous system, store the fundamental matrix for the homogeneous system in
the calculator. (The fundamental matrix is the matrix that houses the linearly
independent solutions to the homogeneous system in its columns.) In the
sections “Solving a first order nonhomogeneous linear system” and “Solving
initial value problems” later in this chapter, I explain how to use the solution
matrix and the fundamental matrix to solve initial value problems and nonho-
mogeneous systems. To store the solution matrix and the fundamental matrix
in the calculator, follow these steps:
1. If you haven’t already done so, find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors
of the coefficient matrix of the homogeneous system, as I explain in
the preceding section.
2. Store the linearly independent solutions to the system in different
one-letter names, as illustrated in the first picture in Figure 15-5.

, where vi is the
eigenvector associated with the eigenvalue ωi. The associated eigenvec-
tor is in the same column of the eigenvector matrix as the real eigen-
value in the list of eigenvalues. For example, if the eigenvalue is the first
eigenvalue in the list of eigenvalues, then the associated eigenvector is
in the first column of the eigenvector matrix.
213
Chapter 15: Dealing with Differential Equations

To enter and store one linearly independent solution in a one-letter
name, follow these steps:
a. Enter the eigenvector.
You have two ways to enter the eigenvector: You can enter it as a
column vector or you can reference its column in the eigenvector
matrix. If the eigenvector matrix is larger than a 2 × 2 matrix and if
you stored this matrix in a one-letter name, it takes fewer key-
strokes to reference its column in the eigenvector matrix than it
does to enter it as a column vector.
If you enter the eigenvector as a column vector, it must be enclosed
in square brackets, as illustrated at the beginning of the command
line in the first picture in Figure 15-5. The rows of the column vector
are separated by semicolons. You enter the square brackets by
pressing 2b and 2e, and you enter the semicolon by pressing
2o.
Entering the eigenvector by referencing its column in the eigenvec-
tor matrix is a bit more complicated because the calculator allows
you to reference a row of a matrix, but not a column. This obstacle is
easily overcome by first transposing the matrix, referencing the row,
and then transposing the result so you have a column matrix. To do
this, press cÉ, press the key that corresponds to the letter of
the name you gave this matrix, and press 2zy¨ to transpose the
matrix. Then press 2b to enter a left bracket, enter the number of
the column in which the eigenvector appears in the eigenvector
matrix, and press 2e to close the brackets. Finally, press d to
close the parentheses and then press 2zy¨ to transpose the
row matrix into a column matrix, as illustrated at the beginning of
the command line in the first picture in Figure 15-7 (shown later).
If you frequently use the calculator to solve systems of more than
two differential equations, consider putting the MatCol function in
the Main folder of your calculator. This function allows you to ref-
erence a column of a matrix by simply specifying the name of the
matrix and the number of the column. I explain how to create and
use this function in Appendix A.

b. Press p¥Ù to multiply the eigenvector by e raised to a power
and then enter the eigenvalue associated with the eigenvector
you entered in the preceding step.
c. Press p and enter the independent variable. Then press d to
close the parentheses.
Although the independent variable in all examples in this chapter
is t, you may have denoted it by some other letter.
d. Press §É and press the key that corresponds to the letter

as illustrated in the first picture in Figure 15-5.
3. Construct the solution matrix and store it in a one-letter name, as
illustrated in the second picture in Figure 15-5 and in the first picture
in Figure 15-8.
The solution matrix for a homogeneous linear system of n differential
equations has the form x(t) = c1x1 + c2x2 + . . . + cnxn where x1, x2, . . . , xn
are the linearly independent solutions you entered in the last step, and
c1, c2, . . . , cn are real variables. Enter the right side of this equation by
using different one-letter names for the real variables. Don’t use the
same names you used in Step 2 to name the linearly independent solu-
tions. After entering a real variable, press p and then enter the name of
the linearly independent solution. 
After entering the solution matrix, press §É and then press the
key that corresponds to the name you want to give this matrix. Don’t use
the same name you used to define any part of the solution matrix. Then
press ¸ to store the solution matrix, as illustrated in the second pic-
ture in Figure 15-5.
4. Construct the fundamental matrix and save it in a one-letter name, as
illustrated in the third picture in Figure 15-5 and in the second picture
in Figure 15-8.
The fundamental matrix for a homogeneous system of differential equa-
tions is the matrix that houses the linearly independent solutions to the
system in its columns. This matrix is constructed by augmenting the lin-
early independent solutions you constructed in Step 2 into one matrix.
But they have to be augmented two at a time, as illustrated in the third
picture in Figure 15-5 and in the second picture in Figure 15-8.
To augment two matrices, press 2zym to select the augment com-
mand from the MATH Matrix menu. Then enter the name of the first
matrix, press b, enter the name of the second matrix, and then press d
to close the parentheses, as illustrated in the third picture in Figure 15-5.
You can augment three matrices the same way you augment two matri-
ces: by nesting the augment command, as illustrated in the second pic-
ture in Figure 15-8. To augment four linearly independent solutions, u, v,
w, and x, use augment(augment(u, v), augment(w, x)).

Chapter 15: Dealing with Differential Equations

After constructing the fundamental matrix, press §É and then
press the key that corresponds to the letter of the name you want to
give this matrix — use a letter that you have not used in the preceding
steps. Then press ¸ to store the fundamental matrix.
Dealing with repeated eigenvalues and distinct eigenvectors
The first picture in Figure 15-6 shows a coefficient matrix A with a repeated
eigenvalue, namely 2. But as the second picture in this figure shows, A has a
complete set of distinct eigenvectors. Because these eigenvectors are linearly
independent, the solution to the homogeneous system x'(t) = Ax(t) in this
figure is x(t) = c1v1e9t + c2v2e2t + c3v3e2t where v1 is the eigenvector in the first
column of the matrix in the second picture in this figure, and v2 and v3 are
respectively the eigenvalues in the second and third columns in the matrix in
the third picture in this figure. (You discover how to find eigenvalues and
eigenvectors in the earlier section, “Finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors.”)
If you want to use the solution to solve an initial value problem, store the
solution matrix for the homogeneous system in the calculator. And if you
want to use the solution to the homogeneous system to solve a nonhomoge-
neous system, store the fundamental matrix for the homogeneous system in
the calculator. (The fundamental matrix is the matrix that houses the linearly
independent solutions to the homogeneous system in its columns.) Later in
this chapter, I explain how to use the solution matrix and the fundamental
matrix to solve initial value problems and nonhomogeneous systems. To
store the solution matrix and the fundamental matrix in the calculator, follow
the steps in the preceding section. The process of following these steps using
the homogeneous system in Figure 15-6 is illustrated in Figures 15-7 and 15-8.
Dealing with repeated eigenvalues and repeated eigenvectors
The first picture in Figure 15-9 shows a coefficient matrix A with a repeated
eigenvalue, namely 4. But as the second picture in this figure shows, A also
has a repeated eigenvector. (For more information on finding eigenvalues and
eigenvectors, see the earlier section “Finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors.”)

Finding the n linearly independent solutions needed to solve a homogeneous
system of n differential equations gets quite complicated when you have both
repeated eigenvalues and repeated eigenvectors. In this section, I tell you
how to use the calculator to find two linearly independent solutions when
the eigenvalue and associated eigenvector are both repeated twice. For the
more general case (when eigenvectors are repeated more than twice), consult
a textbook on differential equations. Although I don’t tell you the mathematics
needed to solve the general case, the way you use the calculator to solve the
general case is quite similar to the way you use it to solve the case I do tell
you about.

where u and v are nonzero solutions to the matrix equa-
tions (A – ωI)2v = 0 and (A – ωI)v = u. To use the calculator to find the solu-
tions for the vectors u and v, follow these steps:
1. Store the matrix A – ωI in a one-letter name, as illustrated in the first
entry in the first picture in Figure 15-10.
A is the coefficient matrix of the homogeneous linear system of differen-
tial equations, and ω is the repeated eigenvalue. You enter the identity
matrix I by pressing 2zy{, then entering the number of rows in the
identity matrix, and then pressing d to close the parentheses.
2. Press 2zyy to select the rref (reduced row-echelon form) com-
mand from the MATH Matrix menu.
3. Press É and press the key that corresponds to the letter of the
name you gave matrix A – ωI in Step 1. Then press Z© to square that
matrix. Finally, press d to close the parentheses and then press ¸
to express (A – ωI)2 in reduced row-echelon form, as illustrated in the
second entry in the first picture in Figure 15-10.
4. Find, by hand, a nonzero solution to (A – ωI )2v = 0. Enter this solution
as a column vector and store it in a one-letter name, as illustrated in
the first entry in the second picture in Figure 15-10.
(A – ωI)2v = 0 never has a unique solution, so the calculator cannot find a
nonzero solution for you. But finding that solution by hand is so easy you
rarely even have to reach for a pencil. Here’s why: (A – ωI)2v = 0 is a homo-
geneous system of equations stated in matrix form, and rref(A – ωI)2v = 0
is the equivalent reduced row-echelon form of this system. So finding a
nonzero solution to (A – ωI)2v = 0 is equivalent to finding a nonzero solu-
tion to Mv = 0, where M is the matrix you found in Step 3. You can usually
just look at the matrix to find a nonzero solution.

Part V: Doing Calculus 

For example, in the second entry in the first picture in Figure 15-10, rref
(A – ωI)2 is the zero matrix. So any value of v is a solution to (A – ωI)2v = 0.
In particular, v = [1 0]T is a nonzero solution. Other nonzero solutions
are v = [0 1]T, v = [1 1]T, and so on. But all you need is one nonzero solution.

can pick any nonzero values for a and b that satisfy the equation a + 2b =

solution to (A – ωI)2v = 0.
To enter and store your solution for v, first enter v as a column vector.
(A column vector must be enclosed in square brackets. The rows of the
column vector are separated by semicolons. You enter the square brack-
ets by pressing 2b and 2e, and you enter the semicolon by press-
ing 2o.) Then press §É and press the key that corresponds to
the letter of the name you want to give this vector. Then press ¸ to
store the vector, as illustrated in the first entry in the second picture in
Figure 15-10.
5. To find vector u, first press É and then press the key that corre-
sponds to the letter of the name you gave matrix A – ωI in Step 1. Then
press pÉ and press the key that corresponds to the one-letter
name you gave the vector you found in Step 4. Finally, press
§É, press the key that corresponds to the letter of the name
you want to give this vector, and then press ¸ to display the
vector, as illustrated in the second entry in the second picture in
Figure 15-10 (shown earlier).

If you want to use the solution to solve an initial value problem, store the
solution matrix for the homogeneous system in the calculator. And if you
want to use the solution to the homogeneous system to solve a nonhomoge-
neous system, store the fundamental matrix for the homogeneous system in
the calculator. (The fundamental matrix is the matrix that houses the linearly
independent solutions to the homogeneous system in its columns.) Later in
this chapter, I explain how to use the solution matrix and the fundamental
matrix to solve initial value problems and nonhomogeneous systems. 
219
Chapter 15: Dealing with Differential Equations

To store the solution matrix and the fundamental matrix in the calculator,
follow these steps:
1. If you haven’t already done so, follow the steps at the beginning of
this section to find vectors v and u.
When an eigenvalue ω and its associated eigenvector are each repeated
two times, the two linearly independent solutions generated by that
eigenvalue are x

, where u and v are
nonzero solutions to the matrix equations (A – ωI)2v = 0 and (A – ωI)v =

given them different names, but in the following steps I call them v and u.

To do this, press c, enter the name you gave to vector u, press p, and
enter the independent variable. (I denote the independent variable by t,
you may have used a different letter.) Then press «, enter the name you
gave to vector v, and press d to close the parentheses. Then press
p¥Ù, enter the eigenvalue, press p, and enter the independent vari-
able. Finally, press §É, enter the name you want to give this
solution, and then press ¸ to store the solution. Because you don’t
need vector v anymore, you can give this solution the same name you
gave vector v.

and enter the independent variable. Finally, press §É, enter the
name you want to give this solution, and then press ¸ to store the
solution in the calculator. Because you don’t need vector u anymore,
you can give this solution the same name you gave vector u.

4. To construct the solution matrix and the fundamental matrix, follow
Steps 3 and 4 in the section titled “Dealing with distinct real eigenval-
ues,” earlier in this chapter.
The first picture in Figure 15-12 shows the solution matrix for the system
of differential equations with the coefficient matrix in the first picture in
Figure 15-9 (shown earlier), and the second picture in Figure 15-12 dis-
plays the fundamental matrix for this system.
Dealing with complex eigenvalues and eigenvectors
Complex eigenvalues of the coefficient matrix A of a linear system of differen-
tial equations always come in complex conjugate pairs, as illustrated in the
first picture in Figure 15-13. Their associated eigenvectors are also conju-
gates, as illustrated in the second picture in this figure. (I explain finding
eigenvalues and eigenvectors earlier in this chapter.)
As any textbook on differential equations tells you, when the coefficient
matrix A of a homogeneous linear system of differential equations has a com-
plex eigenvalue ω with associated eigenvector v, the real and imaginary parts
of the complex solution to x t
ve
t

are linearly independent, real solutions

, follow these steps:
1. If you found the complex eigenvalues and eigenvectors by following
the steps in the earlier section, “Finding eigenvalues and eigenvec-
tors,” go to Step 2. If not, follow Steps 1 and 11 in “Finding eigenval-
ues and eigenvectors.”
Step 1 in that section tells you how to set the Mode to get the calculator
to properly display the solutions you’re about to find, and Step 11 tells
you how to display and store the eigenvectors in a simplified form, as
illustrated in the last entry in the second picture in Figure 15-13. 
2. Enter the eigenvector associated with the complex eigenvalue.
The associated eigenvector is in the same column of the eigenvector
matrix as the complex eigenvalue in the list of eigenvalues. For example,
if the complex eigenvalue is the first eigenvalue in the list of eigenvalues,
then the associated eigenvector is in the first column of the eigenvector
matrix. 
There are two ways to enter this eigenvector: You can enter it as a
column vector, or you can reference its column in the eigenvector
matrix. If the eigenvector matrix is larger than a 2 × 2 matrix and if you
stored this matrix in a one-letter name, it takes fewer keystrokes to refer-
ence its column in the eigenvector matrix than it does to enter it as a
column vector.
If you enter the eigenvector as a column vector, you must enclose it in
square brackets, as illustrated at the beginning of the command line in
the third picture in Figure 15-13. The rows of the column vector are sepa-
rated by semicolons. You enter the square brackets by pressing 2b
and 2e, you enter the semicolon by pressing 2o, and you enter the
complex number i by pressing 2½.
Entering the eigenvector by referencing its column in the eigenvector
matrix is a bit more complicated because the calculator allows you to
reference a row of a matrix, but not a column. You can easily overcome
this obstacle by first transposing the matrix, referencing the row, and
then transposing the result so you have a column matrix. To do this,
press cÉ, press the key that corresponds to the letter of the name
you gave this matrix, and press 2zy¨ to transpose the matrix. Then
press 2b to enter a left bracket, enter the number of the column in
which the eigenvector appears in the eigenvector matrix, and press
2e to close the brackets. Finally, press d to close the parentheses
and then press 2zy¨ to transpose the row matrix into a column
matrix, as illustrated at the beginning of the command line in the first
picture in Figure 15-14.
222
Part V: Doing Calculus 

3. Press p¥Ù to multiply the eigenvector by e raised to the eigenvalue
that you enter in the next step.
4. Enter the complex eigenvalue associated with the eigenvector you
entered in Step 2.
You have two ways to enter this eigenvalue: You can enter it as a com-
plex number or, if you stored the list of eigenvalues in a one-letter name,
you can reference its location in this list. If you enter the eigenvalue as a
complex number, you must surround it with parentheses, as illustrated
on the command line of the third picture in Figure 15-13. You enter the
complex number i by pressing 2½.
To enter the complex eigenvalue by referencing its location in the named
list of eigenvalues, press É and then press the key that corresponds
to the letter of the name you gave to this list. Then press 2b, enter the
location of the eigenvalue in the list, and press 2e to close the brack-
ets, as illustrated on the command line in the first picture in Figure 15-14.
5. Press p and enter the independent variable. Then press d to close
the parentheses.
The independent variable in all examples in this chapter is t. You might
have denoted it by some other letter.
6. Press §É and then press the key that corresponds to the letter
of the name you want to give the complex solution matrix. Then press
¸ to find the matrix form of the complex solution to the system of
differential equations, as illustrated in the third picture in Figure 15-
13 and the first picture in Figure 15-14.
7. Find the real and imaginary parts of the solution matrix. Store each in
a one-letter name.
To find the real part, press 2zz© to select the real command from
the MATH Complex menu, and then press É and the key that corre-
sponds to the letter of the name you gave the solution matrix in Step 6.
Press d to close the parentheses, press §É, and then press the
key that corresponds to the one-letter name you want to give this vector.
Finally, press ¸ to display and store the vector, as illustrated in the
Figure 15-14:

second picture in Figure 15-14. Similarly, to find the imaginary part,
press 2zzª to select the imag command from the MATH Complex
menu, press É and the key that corresponds to the letter of the
name you gave the solution matrix. Then press d§É, enter a
letter to name the vector, and press ¸, as illustrated in the third pic-
ture in Figure 15-14.
The vectors in the last two pictures in Figure 15-14 show that the general solu-
tion to the homogeneous system of differential equations with the coefficient 
matrix in the first picture of Figure 15-13 is

If you want to use this solution to solve an initial value problem, store the
real solution matrix for the homogeneous system in the calculator. And if you
want to use the solution to the homogeneous system to solve a nonhomoge-
neous system, store the fundamental matrix for the homogeneous system.
(The fundamental matrix is the matrix that houses the linearly independent
solutions to the homogeneous system in its columns.) Later in this chapter, I
explain how to use the solution matrix and the fundamental matrix to solve
initial value problems and nonhomogeneous systems. 
To construct the real solution matrix and the fundamental matrix, follow
Steps 3 and 4 in the section titled “Dealing with distinct real eigenvalues,”
which appears earlier in this chapter. The first picture in Figure 15-15 shows
the solution matrix for the system of differential equations with the coeffi-
cient matrix in the first picture in Figure 15-13, and the second picture in
Figure 15-15 displays the fundamental matrix for this system.
Solving a first order nonhomogeneous
linear system
Without going into great mathematical detail, the general solution to a first
order nonhomogeneous linear system x'(t) = Ax(t) + g(t) is x(t) = xc(t) + xp(t),
Figure 15-15:

where xc(t) is the general solution to the associated homogeneous system
x'(t) = Ax(t), and xp(t) is a particular solution to the original nonhomo-
geneous system. And the method of variations of parameters states that

is a particular solution to the nonhomogeneous 
system. In this formula, Φ(t) is the fundamental matrix of the associated
homogeneous system; that is, it is the matrix whose columns contain the 
linearly independent solution vectors of the associated homogeneous
system.
I explain how to find the general solution to the associated homogeneous
system earlier in this chapter. To get the calculator to find a particular solu-
tion, follow these steps:
1. If you haven’t already done so, construct the fundamental matrix
for the associated homogeneous system and store it in a one-letter
name.
You find out how to do this in the earlier section, “Solving first order
homogeneous systems.” In Figure 15-16, the fundamental matrix is the
matrix f in the third picture in Figure 15-5. This is the fundamental matrix
for the homogeneous system having the coefficient matrix in the first
picture in Figure 15-4.
2. Press É and then press the key that corresponds to the name you
gave the fundamental matrix in Step 1.
3. Press p2mÉ, press the key that corresponds to the name you
gave the fundamental matrix, and then press Z·¨.
4. Press p and enter g(t), as illustrated on the command line in
Figure 15-16.
In Figure 15-16, the fundamental matrix is named f, and g(t) is

A column vector must be enclosed in square brackets, and the rows of
the column vector are separated by semicolons. You enter the square
brackets by pressing 2b and 2e, and you enter the semicolon by
pressing 2o.
5. Press b, enter the independent variable, and then press d to close
the parentheses.
The independent variable in all examples in this chapter is t. However,
you might have denoted it by some other letter.
6. If you plan to use the solution to the nonhomogeneous system to solve
an initial value problem, press §É and then press the key that
corresponds to the letter of the name you want to give the particular
solution, as illustrated at the end of the command line in Figure 15-16.
7. Press ¸ to display the particular solution, as illustrated in
Figure 15-16.
225
Chapter 15: Dealing with Differential Equations

Solving initial value problems
An initial value problem for a linear system of differential equations has the
form x'(t) = Ax(t) + g(t), x(t0) = x0, where t0 is the initial value of the indepen-
dent variable t. To solve such a problem, follow these steps:
1. If you haven’t already done so, construct the solution matrix for the
associated homogeneous system and store it in a one-letter name.
I explain how to do this earlier, in the section “Solving first order homo-
geneous systems.” In Figure 15-17, the solution matrix is the matrix c in
the second picture in Figure 15-5. This is the solution matrix for the
homogeneous system with the coefficient matrix in the first picture in
Figure 15-4.
2. Evaluate the solution matrix at the initial value of the independent
variable and store the result in a one-letter name, as illustrated in the
first entry in the first picture in Figure 15-17.
To do this, follow these steps:
a. Press É, press the key that corresponds to the name you
gave the solution matrix, and then press Í (the with command).
b. Enter the independent variable, press Á, and then enter the ini-
tial value of the independent variable.
The initial condition used in Figure 15-17 is x 0

c. Press §É and press the key that corresponds to the letter
you want to use to name this matrix. 
Use a letter you haven’t used before while solving the homoge-

d. Press ¸ to evaluate the solution matrix at the initial value of
the independent variable.
3. Solve the system of equations obtained by setting the matrix in Step 2
equal to the initial condition, as illustrated in the second entry in the
first picture in Figure 15-17.
To do this, follow these steps:
a. Press „¨ to place the solve command on the command line.
b. Enter the left side of the first equation, press Á, and then enter
the right side of the same equation.
The left side of the first equation is the first row in the matrix you
stored in the calculator in Step 2. To enter it in the calculator, press
É, press the key that corresponds to the name you gave the
matrix in Step 2, and then press 2b¨b¨2e to tell the calcu-
lator that you want the entry in the first row, first column of this
matrix.
The right side of this equation is in the first row of the initial condi-

To enter the left side of the next equation, press É, press the
key that corresponds to the name you gave the matrix in Step 2,
press 2b, and then press the number key that corresponds to the
number of the equation. (For example, press © for the second equa-
tion, ª for the third equation, and so on.) Finally, press b¨2e to
tell the calculator that you want the entry in the first — and only —
column of this matrix.
If you’re entering the nth equation, the right side of this equation

e. Press b and then enter the list of constants enclosed in braces
and separated by commas, as illustrated on the command line in
the first picture in Figure 15-17.
The constants you enter in this step are the constants you used to
define the solution matrix. For example, the solution matrix c in
the second picture in Figure 15-5 denotes these constants by k and
l. You enter the braces by pressing 2c and 2d.
f. Press d to close the parentheses and then press ¸ to solve

4. Solve the initial value problem for the homogeneous system by evalu-
ating the solution matrix at the values obtained in the preceding step,
as illustrated in the second picture in Figure 15-17.
To do this, enter the name you gave the solution matrix in Step 1 and
press Í to insert the with command. Then press C to highlight the
solutions you found in the preceding step and press ¸ to place
these solutions on the command line. Finally, press ¸ to evaluate
the solution matrix.

Solving systems of higher order ODEs
The method of using eigenvalues and eigenvectors to solve a linear system of
first order ODEs (ordinary differential equations), which I explain earlier in
this chapter, can also be used to solve a linear system of higher order ODEs if
you first transform each equation in the system to a system of first order
ODEs. I explain how to do this in the sidebar in this chapter.
228
Part V: Doing Calculus 

As an example, the last example in the sidebar transforms the system x'' = –3x

I explain how to solve this nonhomogeneous system of first order equations
earlier in this chapter. The solutions to the system x'' = –3x + y and y'' = 2x –
2y + 40 sin(3t) are x(t) and y(t), which are respectively housed in the first and
third rows of the column vector x.
Graphing ODEs and Systems of ODEs
The calculator can graph slope fields for only first order ODEs, but it can
graph the solution to an initial value problem for any order ODE. It can also
graph direction fields and phase portraits in the phase plane for a system of
two ODEs. The following three sections explain how to get the calculator to
do these things.
Graphing slope fields and solutions
to first order ODEs
The first order differential equation 
,
dx
dy
F
x y
=
_
i is a formula for the slope of 
the tangent to the solution curve y = f(x) at an arbitrary point (x, y). The
slope field of this first order differential equation is a graph consisting of
short line segments representing the tangent, and thus the slope, at the
points (x, y). To get the calculator to graph a slope field, follow these steps:
1. Press 3B{¸ to set the Graph mode to DIFF EQUATIONS.
2. Press ¥ƒ to enter the Y= editor and uncheck or clear any currently
existing functions.
The calculator can graph only one slope field at a time. And only those
differential equations in the Y= editor with checkmarks to the left of
their names can have their slope fields graphed, as illustrated in the first
picture in Figure 15-18, in which the slope field of y1 can be graphed, but
those of y2 and y3 can’t.
To change the checked status of a differential equation, use the CD
keys to highlight the differential equation and then press † to toggle
the check mark between being displayed and not being displayed.
229
Chapter 15: Dealing with Differential Equations

To clear a single differential equation from the Y= editor, use the CD
keys to highlight the equation and then press M. To clear all differ-
ential equations currently in the Y= editor, press ƒn¸.
3. If you’re graphing only the slope field, set t0 equal to 0. If you’re
graphing the slope field and a solution curve, set t0 equal to the value
of the independent variable in the initial condition for the solution
curve.
For example, if you want to graph the initial value problem 
,
dx
dy
F
x y
=
_
i
with y(a) = b, set t0 equal to a.
t0 is the first entry in the Y= editor. To edit the value assigned to this
variable, repeatedly press C to highlight the current value, press ¸
to place the cursor on the command line, use the number keys to enter
the value you want to assign to t0, and then press ¸.
4. Enter your first order differential equation.
When entering first order differential equations in the Y= editor, the
independent variable must be denoted by t, and the dependent variable
must be entered in the form yn where n is the number of the differential
equation. For example, if the differential equation y' + x2 = sin(y) is entered
in y1', you must enter it in the form sin(y1) – t2, as illustrated in the first
picture in Figure 15-18.
To enter or edit the definition of a differential equation in yn', use the
CD keys to place the cursor to the right of the equal sign and press
¸ or … to place the cursor on the command line. Then enter or edit
the definition of the differential equation and press ¸ when you’re
finished. (See Chapter 1 for the details on entering and editing expres-
sions.) To enter y1, for example, press Ú¨. To enter the independent
variable, press Ü.
Because the calculator can graph only one slope field at a time, after
completing this step, only one differential equation in the Y= editor
should be checked. If this isn’t the case, you get an error message when
you try to graph the slope field. The directions in Step 2 tell you how to
deselect differential equations in the Y= editor.

and

5. If you want to graph only the slope field of the differential equation
you entered in yn', leave yin blank. If you want to graph the slope
field and a solution curve, set yin equal to the value of the dependent
variable in the initial condition for the solution curve.
For example, if you want to graph the initial value problem 
,
dx
dy
F
x y
=
_
i
with y(a) = b, set yin equal to b.
To leave yin blank or to edit its current value, use the CD keys to high-
light the current value in yin. To leave yin blank, press M. To edit its
current value, press ¸ to place the cursor on the command line, use
the number keys to enter the value you want to assign to yin, and then
press ¸.
You can graph more than one solution curve by entering the initial con-
ditions for the curves in a list, as illustrated on the command line of the
first picture in Figure 15-18. The graph of these curves is shown in the
second picture of this figure. A list must be enclosed in braces and its
elements must be separated by commas. You enter the braces by press-
ing 2c for the left brace and 2d for the right.
6. Press ƒC¸ to display the Graph Formats menu and set the last
item (Fields) to SLPFLD. Set the other items to the options of your
choice.
To select options from this menu, use the CD keys to place the cursor
on the desired format, press B to display the options for that format,
and then press the number of the option you want. When you’re finished
setting the various formats, press ¸ to save your settings.
An explanation of the Graph Formats menu options follows:
• Coordinates: This format gives you a choice between having the
coordinates of the location of the cursor displayed at the bottom
of the graph screen in three ways. Select RECT to display the loca-
tion of the cursor as (x, y) rectangular coordinates, or select
POLAR to display points as (r, θ) polar coordinates. If for some
strange reason you don’t want to see the coordinates of the cursor
when you trace the graph, select OFF.
• Grid: Set this to ON if you want the calculator to graph the inter-
section points of the tick marks on the horizontal and vertical
axes. Because the slope field is typically graphed over these
points, my recommendation is to select OFF.
• Axes: If you don’t want to see the axes on your graph, select OFF; if
you do want to see them, select ON. I recommend selecting ON.
• Leading Cursor: Set this to ON if you want the calculator to ani-
mate the cursor as it graphs a solution curve. My recommendation
is to select OFF.
• Labels: If you want the x- and y-axes to be labeled, select ON; other-
wise, select OFF. My recommendation is to select OFF — you know
what the axes are and the labels are rarely placed near the axes.
231
Chapter 15: Dealing with Differential Equations

• Solution Method: The calculator uses the RK (Runge-Kutta) or
EULER numerical method to graph slope fields and solution
curves. RK is more accurate, but it takes more time than EULER. 
I recommend selecting RK.
If the calculator takes a long time to produce a graph by using the
RK solution method, press ´ to stop the calculation and then
press ƒC¸DDDDDB©¸ to change to the EULER solu-
tion method. The calculator then draws the graph by using the
faster Euler method.
• Fields: Select SLPFLD to graph first order differential equations. If
you try to graph first order differential equations by using any
other Fields option, you get an error message.
7. Press ¥„ to enter the Window editor, and then set xmin, xmax, xscl,
ymin, ymax, and yscl to an appropriate window size. Set ncurves to an
integer between 0 and 10, inclusive. Then press ¥… to draw the graph.
To edit the value assigned to a Window variable, use the CD keys to
highlight the current value, key in the new value, and then press ¸.
After the graph is drawn, the calculator displays a circle around the ini-
tial conditions, as illustrated in the last two pictures in Figure 15-18.
xmin, xmax, ymin, and ymax are, respectively, the smallest and largest
values of x in view on the x-axis and the smallest and largest values of y
in view on the y-axis. xscl and yscl give the spacing between tick marks
on the respective axes.
ncurves should be set to 0 if you’re graphing only the slope field or if
you assigned one or more values to yin in Step 5. If yin is blank and
ncurves is set to 5, for example, the calculator automatically draws 5
solution curves, as illustrated in the third picture in Figure 15-18.
If you don’t know an appropriate size for the viewing window, press „{
to draw the graph in the standard viewing window (–1 ≤x ≤10, –10 ≤y ≤
10) and then, if necessary, repeat this step to find a better viewing
window.
If you know how you want to set the x-axis in your viewing window but
you don’t know how to set the y-axis, enter your values for xmin, xmax,
and xscl and then press „CCC¸ to have the calculator figure out
the appropriate y-values and draw the graph in the resulting window.
Then, if necessary, repeat this step to adjust ymin, ymax, and yscl.
To trace a solution curve, press … and use the AB keys to display the coor-
dinates of the points on the solution curve. If you have more than one solu-
tion curve, use the CD keys to move the cursor to another solution curve
and then use the AB keys to trace that curve.
232
Part V: Doing Calculus 

After graphing a slope field, with or without solution curves, you can add
solution curves to the graph. To do this, first press 2…, as illustrated in
the first picture in Figure 15-19. If you know the coordinates of a point
through which the curve passes, enter the t-coordinate of that point, press
¸, enter the y-coordinate, and then press ¸. If you don’t know the
exact coordinates of a point on the solution curve, use the Arrow keys to
move the cursor to a point on the slope field, as illustrated in the second pic-
ture in Figure 15-19, and then press ¸ to draw the solution curve that
passes through that point, as illustrated in the third picture in this figure. To
erase any solution curves you added to the slope field, press †. Solution
curves added in this fashion cannot be traced.
Graphing solutions to higher order ODEs
For differential equations of order greater than one, the calculator is capable
of graphing only one solution to an initial value problem. To graph such a
solution, follow these steps:
1. Convert your higher order initial value problem to a system of first
order differential equations.
Because the calculator can graph only first order differential equations,
you must convert higher order differential equations to a system of first
order differential equations. The sidebar in this chapter tells you how to
do this. 
As an example, the second order initial value problem

3. Press ¥ƒ to enter the Y= editor and then set t0 equal to the value of
the independent variable in the initial condition for the solution
curve.
For example, if you want to graph the initial value problem

, set t0 equal to a.
t0 is the first entry in the Y= editor. To edit the value assigned to this
variable, repeatedly press C to highlight the current value, press ¸
to place the cursor on the command line, use the number keys to enter
the value you want to assign to t0, and then press ¸.
4. Enter your system of first order differential equations and initial con-
ditions, as illustrated in the first picture in Figure 15-20.
Steps 4 and 5 in the preceding section give details on entering first order
differential equations and initial conditions. Equations y2' and y3' in the
first picture of Figure 15-18 show you how to enter the equations in the
first picture of Figure 15-20 when there are other differential equations in
the Y= editor.
5. Press ‡¨ to uncheck all differential equations in the Y= editor. Then
use the CD cursor keys to highlight the first equation in your system
of equations and press † to place a checkmark next to it, as illus-
trated in the first picture in Figure 15-20.
The solution to the original higher order differential equation is y. When
you converted this higher order equation to a system of first order
ODEs, you set y1 = y. So the solution you want to find is the solution to
only the first equation in the system.
6. Press ƒC¸ to display the Graph Formats menu and set the last
item (Fields) to FLDOFF. Set the other items to the options of your
choice.
Step 6 in the preceding section gives details on how to set the items in
the Graph Formats menu. If the Fields item in this menu isn’t set to
FLDOFF, you get an error message or unexpected results.

7. Press ¥„ to enter the Window editor and set xmin, xmax, xscl, ymin,
ymax, and yscl to an appropriate window size. Then press ¥… to
draw the graph, as illustrated in the second picture in Figure 15-20.
Should you need it, Step 7 in the preceding section gives details on how
to set these items in the Window editor. It also gives tips on what to do if
you don’t know what values to give these items.
To trace a solution curve, press … and use the AB keys to display the coor-
dinates of the points on the solution curve.
After graphing a higher order initial value problem, you can graph another
solution that has different initial conditions. To do this, first press 2…, as
illustrated in the first picture in Figure 15-21. Because you’re graphing the first
equation in your system as a function of t, press ¸ to accept the default
setting. If you know the coordinates of a point through which the curve passes,
enter the t-coordinate of that point, press ¸, enter the y-coordinate, and
then press ¸. If you don’t know the exact coordinates of a point on the
solution curve, use the Arrow keys to move the cursor to a point on the slope
field, as illustrated in the second picture in Figure 15-21, and then press ¸
to draw the solution curve that passes through that point, as illustrated in the
third picture. To erase any solution curves you added to the slope field, press
†. Solution curves added in this fashion can’t be traced.
Graphing phase planes and portraits
The phase plane of a system of two differential equations y1' = f(t, y1, y2) and 
y2' = g(t, y1, y2) is the plane in which the x-axis is y1 and the y-axis is y2. A phase
portrait is a graph, in parametric form (y1(t), y2(t)), of this system subject to
given initial conditions. The calculator can graph the slope field (direction
field) of the phase plane and it can graph a phase portrait. To do this, follow
these steps:
1. If necessary, press 3B{¸ to set the Graph mode to DIFF
EQUATIONS.

2. Press ¥ƒ to enter the Y= editor and set t0 equal to the value of the
independent variable in the initial condition for the solution curve.
For example, if you want to graph the initial value problem

t0 is the first entry in the Y= editor. To edit the value assigned to this
variable, repeatedly press C to highlight the current value, press ¸
to place the cursor on the command line, use the number keys to enter
the value you want to assign to t0, and then press ¸.
3. Enter your system of two first order differential equations and initial
conditions, as illustrated in the first picture in Figure 15-22.
Steps 4 and 5 in the earlier section, “Graphing slope fields and solutions
to first order ODEs,” give details on entering first order differential equa-
tions and initial conditions.
The calculator usually doesn’t understand juxtaposition (implied multi-
plication), so when in doubt, press p to tell the calculator you are multi-
plying. For example, the calculator views y1y2, the juxtaposition of the
two variables y1 and y2, as a single variable with a four-character name.
To tell the calculator that you are multiplying these two variables, enter
y1py2.
If you want to see only the direction field, leave the initial conditions
blank.
4. Make sure that the only differential equations in the Y= editor that
are checked are the two equations in the system you’re graphing.
This is illustrated in the first picture of Figure 15-22, in which the first
two equations in the Y= editor are the equations in the system that will
be graphed.
To change the checked status of a differential equation, use the CD
keys to highlight the differential equation and then press † to toggle
the checkmark between being displayed and not being displayed.

5. Press ƒC¸ to display the Graph Formats menu and set the last
item (Fields) to DIRFLD. Set the other items to the options of your
choice.
Step 6 in the earlier section titled “Graphing slope fields and solutions to
first order ODEs” gives details on how to set the items in the Graph
Formats menu. If the Fields item in this menu is not set to DIRFLD, you
will get an error message or unexpected results.
6. Press ¥„ to enter the Window editor and set xmin, xmax, xscl, ymin,
ymax, and yscl to an appropriate window size. Then press ¥… to
draw the graph, as illustrated in the second picture in Figure 15-22.
Should you need it, Step 7 in the earlier section, “Graphing slope fields
and solutions to first order ODEs,” gives details on how to set these
items in the Window editor. It also gives tips on what to do if you don’t
know what values to give these items.
7. If you don’t get a complete graph, as in the second picture in Figure
15-22, press ¥„ and increase the value assigned to tmax in the
Window editor. Then press ¥… to redraw the graph, as illustrated in
the third picture in this figure.
To trace a solution curve, press … and use the AB keys to display the coor-
dinates of the points on the solution curve. At the bottom of the screen, tc
gives the value of the independent variable t, and xc and yc are respectively
the values of the solutions to the first and second equations in your system
at this value of t.
After graphing a phase plane, with or without a phase portrait, you can add
phase portraits to the graph. To do this, first press 2…, as illustrated in
the first picture in Figure 15-23. If you know the initial values you want to
assign the two equations in your system, enter the value for the first equation
in the system, press ¸, enter the value for the second equation, and then
press ¸. If you don’t know the initial values, use the Arrow keys to move
the cursor to a point on the phase plane, as illustrated in the second picture
in Figure 15-23, and then press ¸ to draw the phase portrait, as illus-
trated in the third picture. To erase any phase portraits you added to the
direction field, press †. Phase portraits added in this fashion cannot be
traced.

Part V: Doing Calculus 
Dealing with ODEs of large order
The abilities of the calculator appear to limit you
to solving only first or second order ODEs, to
solving only linear systems of first order ODEs,
and to graphing only first or second order ODEs.
But a mathematical solution to these apparent
limitations does exist — just convert the higher
order ODEs to a system of first order ODEs!
Here’s how you do this.
A higher order ODE has the form y(n) = f(t, y, y',
y'', …, y(n - 1)), where y(k) denotes the kth deriva-
tive of y with respect to t. This ODE is converted
to a system of n first order ODEs by setting y1 =
y, y2 =y', y3 = y'', . . . , yn = y(n - 1). These settings
result in y'1 = y' = y2, y'2 = y'' = y3, . . . , y'n = y(n),
where y(n) = f(t, y, y', y'', . . . , y(n - 1)) = f(t, y1, y2, 
y3, . . . , yn). This gives the system:

As an example, the third order ODE y''' + 3y'' +
2y' – 5y = sin(2t) can be written as y''' = f(t, y, y',
y'') = 5y – 2y' – 3y'' + sin(2t). Substituting y1 = y,
y2 = y', and y3 = y'' results in the system:

This method can also be used to transform a
system of ODEs of order greater than one to a
system of first order ODEs by converting each
equation in the system to a system of first order
ODEs. This comes in quite handy if you want
to use the calculator to solve for or graph
the solutions to the original system of higher
order ODEs.

A
matrix is a rectangular array of elements arranged in rows and
columns. The dimensions, r × c, of a matrix are defined by the number
of rows and columns in the matrix. The calculator allows you to define as
many matrices as the memory of the calculator can accommodate, and that’s
most likely more than you’ll ever need. Even better than that, each matrix
can be huge — dimensions up to 999 × 99 — and can contain just about any
type of element you desire, such as a real or complex number, an expression
like cos(x), or a name like Phido.
Defining a Matrix
You can define a matrix in two places: on the Home screen or in the Data/
Matrix editor. The Data/Matrix editor is by far the best place to define a
matrix, especially if you plan to edit matrix elements at a later time or if you’re
defining several large matrices. On the other hand, if you’re defining only one
or two rather small matrices (such as a 2 × 2 matrix), it’s faster to define them
on the Home screen. This section tells you how to define a matrix on the
Home screen and how to define matrices in the Data/Matrix editor.
Defining a matrix on the Home screen
When you define matrices on the Home screen, you must enclose them
in square brackets, as illustrated on the command line in Figure 16-1. The 

elements in the rows of the matrix are separated by commas, and the rows
are delineated by semicolons. You enter the square brackets by pressing
2b and 2e, and you enter the semicolon by pressing 2o.
If you want to reference your matrix at a later time, store it in a variable, as in
Figure 16-1. This is quite convenient if, for example, you want to add or multi-
ply two matrices. (I explain storing and recalling variables in Chapter 2, and
in Chapter 17 you find out about adding and multiplying matrices.) For exam-
ple, to enter the first matrix in Figure 16-1 and store it in variable a, you use
these keystrokes: 2b¨b©2oªby2e§ÉÁ¸.
Using the Data/Matrix editor
to define and edit matrices
The Data/Matrix editor is a handy place to define and edit matrices, espe-
cially if you have several large matrices to define. And if you’re prone to key-
stroke errors, you’ll appreciate how convenient it is to edit matrices in the
Data/Matrix editor.
Entering a matrix in the Data/Matrix editor
To define one or more matrices in the Data/Matrix editor, follow these steps:
1. Press O.
2. On the TI-89 Titanium, use the Arrow keys to highlight Data/Matri and
then press ¸. On the TI-89, press {.
On the TI-89 Titanium, you see the first picture in Figure 16-2. On the 
TI-89, you see a screen displaying the same information but in a different
location.

Part VI: Dealing with Matrices 

3. Press ª to enter a new matrix and then press B to display the types of
data you can enter, as illustrated in the second picture in Figure 16-2.
4. Press © to tell the calculator that you want to enter a matrix.
5. Press D and select the folder in which the matrix is to be stored.
If you haven’t defined a special folder for your matrix, accept the default
(main) folder and go to the next step. If you have defined a special folder
for your matrix, press B and then press the number key corresponding
to that folder.
6. Press D and key in a name for your matrix.
The name of your matrix can consist of no more than eight characters,
and the first character must be a letter. The calculator is already in
Alpha mode and is expecting the first entry you key in to be a letter. So,
for example, if you want to name your matrix “a,” press Á because the
letter a is above this key. (I explain Alpha mode and entering text in
Chapter 1.)
Although giving your matrix a multicharacter name like “amatrix” is far
more descriptive than giving it a one-letter name such as “a,” when it
comes time to delete the matrix from the memory of the calculator, it’s
much easier to delete matrices that have one-letter names than it is to
delete those that have multi-character names. So if you don’t need your
matrices to remain in the memory of the calculator for a long period of
time, give them one-letter names. I let you know how to delete matrices
from the memory of the calculator later in this chapter.
7. If the last character in the name of your matrix is a letter, press É
to take the calculator out of Alpha mode so that you can enter num-
bers in the following steps.
8. Press D and key in the number of rows in the matrix, and then press
D and key in the number of columns in the matrix.
You see a screen similar to the one in the third picture in Figure 16-2
(shown earlier). 
If you try to key in a number but get a letter, press MÉ and then
enter the number.
9. Press D¸ to define your matrix.
If you get an error message after pressing ¸, this means that the cal-
culator already contains a matrix that has the same name you entered in
Step 6. To rectify this situation, press ¸DD, key in a new name for
your matrix, and then press ¸ twice.
You see a screen similar to the first picture in Figure 16-3, in which the
calculator has filled in the elements of your matrix with zeros and has
highlighted the first-row, first-column element.
243
Chapter 16: Creating and Editing Matrices

You can adjust the width of the columns in your matrix to display more
than the default three columns or to accommodate large matrix entries.
The column width tells you how many characters can be displayed in
each cell of the matrix. So, for example, if the entries in your matrix
range from –10 to 10, you need a column width of 3 to accommodate the
negative sign and the two digits in the number 10. The smallest allow-
able width is 3, and the largest is 12. The default width is 6. To adjust the
column width in your matrix, press ƒC¸B to display the allowable
column widths. Then move down (by using the Arrow keys) to the
desired width and press ¸ two times.
10. Key in the value of the first-row, first-column element, and then press
¸ to store that value in the matrix.
As you key in your value, the cursor moves to the command line and
overwrites the zero entry with the value you key in.
11. Key in the values of the next element in the matrix and press ¸ to
store that value in the matrix. 
Continue to do this until all elements in the matrix are defined to your
specifications.
After you press ¸ to store one element of the matrix in the calcula-
tor’s memory, the cursor highlights the next element in the matrix that
needs to be defined. Key in the value of this element and press ¸.
When there are no more elements to be defined, the last-row, last-column
element that you entered remains highlighted, as in the second picture in
Figure 16-3.
After defining the elements in your matrix, the matrix is automatically
stored in the memory of the calculator under the name you declared in
Step 6. So, for example, you can view the matrix on the Home screen, as
in the third picture in Figure 16-3. To do this, press "É, key in
the name of the matrix, and then press ¸. Press 2O to return
to the Data/Matrix editor.
Figure 16-3:

matrix in the
Data/Matrix
editor and
viewing it on
the Home
screen.
244
Part VI: Dealing with Matrices 

12. To define another matrix, press ƒª and follow Steps 3 through 11. 
13. When you finish defining matrices, press 2N to exit (quit) the
Data/Matrix editor.
You don’t necessarily have to press 2N to exit (quit) the Data/Matrix
editor. Instead, you can press 2O to return to the application you were
using prior to the Data/Matrix editor, or you can enter a new application 
without exiting the Data/Matrix editor. Then, when you want to return to
the Data/Matrix editor, press 2O. For example, if you want to go to the
Home screen after using the Data/Matrix editor, press ". Then if you want
to return to the Data/Matrix editor, press 2O.
Recalling a matrix defined in the Data/Matrix editor
You usually want to recall a matrix so you can edit its elements, resize it, or
add (or delete) rows or columns. I let you know how to complete these tasks
after recalling a matrix later in this chapter. To recall a matrix not currently
displayed in the Data/Matrix editor, follow these steps:
1. If you’re in the Data/Matrix editor but the matrix you want isn’t cur-
rently displayed, press ƒ¨.
If you aren’t already in the Data/Matrix editor, follow Steps 1 and 2 in the
preceding section and then press © to recall the matrix.
You see a screen similar to the first picture in Figure 16-4.
2. Press B© to tell the calculator that you want to open an existing matrix.
3. Press D to advance to the Folder option. 
4. If the matrix isn’t stored in the main folder, press B and then press
the number of the folder in which the matrix is stored.
5. Press DB to display the matrices stored in that folder, as illustrated
in the second picture in Figure 16-4.
6. If necessary, repeatedly press D to highlight the matrix you want to
edit. 
7. Press ¸ to select the highlighted matrix and press ¸ again to
display the matrix.

Chapter 16: Creating and Editing Matrices

Editing a matrix in the Data/Matrix editor
When a matrix is displayed in the Data/Matrix editor, you can edit or redefine
the elements in the matrix. (I tell you how to recall a matrix in the preceding
section.)
To redefine a matrix element, use the Arrow keys to highlight the element and
key in the new value. As you key in the new value, the cursor moves to the
command line and replaces the existing value with the value you key in.
When you’re finished, press ¸ to save that value in the matrix.
To edit a matrix element, use the Arrow keys to highlight the element and
press ¸ to place the value of that element on the command line. Then
press A or B to place the cursor at the beginning or end of the value,
whichever is more convenient for your editing needs. Finally, edit the value
and then press ¸ to save the edited value in the matrix. For example, to
change a matrix element from 12345 to 12305, press B to place the cursor at
the end of 12345 after the 5. Then press A to place the cursor after the 4.
Finally, press 0µ to change the 4 to a zero and then press ¸.
Adding and deleting rows and columns
You can add or delete rows or columns in a matrix that you previously cre-
ated in the Data/Matrix editor. To do so, that matrix must currently be dis-
played in the Data/Matrix editor. 
To add more rows or columns (or both) after the last row or last column
of the matrix, use the Arrow keys to place the cursor in the row or column
you want to add, as illustrated for the 2 × 2 matrix in the first picture in
Figure 16-5, in which the cursor is placed in the third row, third column.
Then key in a value for the new matrix element you’re creating. The calcula-
tor resizes the matrix (as illustrated under the Toolbar in the second picture
in Figure 16-5, where the size of this matrix changed to 3 × 3) and fills in the
remaining elements in the new rows and columns with zeros.
Figure 16-5:

additional
rows and
columns to
a matrix.
246
Part VI: Dealing with Matrices 

To insert a row in a matrix, place the cursor in an existing row, as illustrated
in the first picture in Figure 16-6, and press 2ƒ¨©. The new row is
inserted in the row of the cursor location, and the other rows are moved
down, as illustrated in the second picture in Figure 16-6. To insert a column,
press 2ƒ¨ª. The new column is inserted in the column where the cursor
is located, and the other columns are moved to the right.
To delete a row or column of a matrix, place the cursor in the row or column
and press 2ƒ©© to delete the row containing the cursor or press
2ƒ©ª to delete the column.
Augmenting Two Matrices
Augmenting two matrices allows you to append one matrix to another matrix.
Both matrices must be previously defined and have the same number of
rows. To augment two matrices, follow these steps:
1. If necessary, press " to access the Home screen.
2. Press 2zym to select the augment command from the MATH
Matrix menu.
3. Enter the name of the first matrix and then press b.
The first matrix is the matrix that appears on the left in the augmented
matrix. This is illustrated in the third picture in Figure 16-7.
4. Enter the name of the second matrix and then press d.
5. Store the augmented matrix under a specified name.
To do so, press §, enter the name of the matrix in which you plan to
store the augmented matrix, and then press ¸.
If the name you give the augmented matrix is the same name as an exist-
ing matrix or other stored variable, that matrix or variable will be erased
and replaced with the augmented matrix. If you don’t know what variable
names the calculator is currently using, press 2| and use the D key to
view the names in current use. When you finish viewing variable names,
press 2N.

Chapter 16: Creating and Editing Matrices

Copying One Matrix to Another
There are several situations in which you might want to copy the contents of
one matrix to another. One of these is when you want to define a new matrix
by adding rows or columns to an existing matrix and still keep the existing
matrix in memory. To do so, copy the existing matrix to a new matrix and then
redefine the new matrix to have the number of rows and columns you desire. 
You can make a copy of a matrix in two places: 
 On the Home screen:
1. Key in the name of the matrix you want to copy.
2. Press §.
3. Key in a name for the copy of the matrix.
4. Press ¸ to save the copy under the new name.
 In the Data/Matrix editor:
1. Recall the matrix you want to copy.
For more on how to do this, see the section, “Recalling a matrix
defined in the Data/Matrix editor,” earlier in this chapter.
2. Press ƒ©.
3. Select a folder for the copy of the matrix.
4. Press D.
5. Key in a name for the copy (the calculator is already in Alpha mode).
6. Press ¸ twice.
Independent of where you made a copy of a matrix (on the Home screen or in
the Data/Matrix editor), if the name you give to the copy of the matrix is the
same name as an existing matrix or other stored variable, that matrix or vari-
able will be erased and replaced with the matrix you’re copying. If you aren’t
sure what variable names are currently being used by the calculator, press
2| and use the D key to view the names in current use. When you’re fin-
ished viewing variable names, press 2N.

Part VI: Dealing with Matrices 

After using ƒ© (Save Copy As) in the Data/Matrix editor to make a copy of a
matrix, the calculator displays the original matrix, not the copy. This can be
confusing because the calculator doesn’t tell you the name of the displayed
matrix and because you’re probably used to having a word processor display
the copy of a document after using the same command (Save Copy As). So if
you want to make changes to the copy of your matrix, you have to first recall
(open) it in the Data/Matrix editor. 
Deleting a Matrix from Memory
If you used one-letter names for your matrices, you can quickly delete them
from the memory of the calculator by pressing " if you aren’t already on
the Home screen and then pressing 2ƒ¨¸. The disadvantage of this
method is that it deletes all variables that have one-letter names whether
they be matrices or stored constants.
To delete a single matrix, whether it has a one- or multi-character name, press
2| to display the VAR-LINK screen. Then repeatedly press D to highlight
the name of the matrix you want to delete. (Matrices have the extension MAT
displayed to the right of their names.) Finally, press ƒ¨¸ to delete that
matrix from the memory of the calculator.
To delete several matrices on the VAR-LINK screen, use the D key to highlight
one matrix and press † to place a check next to it. Continue this process until
you have checked all the matrices you want to delete. Then press ƒ¨¸
to delete the checked variables.

o you know how to use the calculator to perform arithmetic operations
with matrices? And do you know how to use matrices to solve a system
of equations? If not, you’re in luck because this chapter tells you how.
Matrix Arithmetic
When evaluating arithmetic expressions that involve matrices, you usually
want to perform the following basic operations:
 Scalar multiplication
 Negation (additive inverse)
 Addition
 Subtraction
 Multiplication
 Inversion (multiplicative inverse)
 Raising a matrix to an integral power
 Finding the transpose of a matrix
 Using the identity matrix in an arithmetic expression

Here’s how you enter these matrix operations in an arithmetic expression:
1. Define the matrices on the Home screen or in the Data/Matrix editor.
You find out how to do this in Chapter 16.
2. Press " to access the Home screen. 
If you want to clear the Home screen, press ƒn. To clear the command
line, press M.
You perform all matrix operations on the Home screen.
3. Enter the operations you want to perform and press ¸ when
you’re finished.
As with algebraic expressions, the Home screen is where you evaluate
arithmetic expressions that involve matrices. To enter the name of a
matrix into an expression, press É and then press the key corre-
sponding to the name you gave the matrix. (For a matrix that has a
multi-character name, press 2É to enter more than one letter, and
then press É to take the calculator out of Alpha mode.) Here’s how
you enter the various operations into the arithmetic expression:
• Entering the scalar multiple of a matrix: To enter the scalar multi-
ple of a matrix in an arithmetic expression, enter the value of the
scalar and then enter the name of the matrix, as shown in the first
picture in Figure 17-1.
• Negating a matrix: To negate a matrix, press · and then enter the
name of the matrix, as shown in the second picture in Figure 17-1.
• Entering the identity matrix: You don’t have to define an identity
matrix on the Home screen or in the Data/Matrix editor in order to
use it in an algebraic expression. To enter an identity matrix in an
expression, press 2zy{ to select the identity command from
the MATH Matrix menu. Then enter the size of the identity matrix
and press d to close the parentheses. For example, enter 2 for the
2 × 2 identity matrix, as in the first picture in Figure 17-2.

Negation

Part VI: Dealing with Matrices 

• Adding or subtracting matrices: When adding or subtracting
matrices, the matrices must have the same dimensions. If they
don’t, you get an error message.
Entering the addition and subtraction of matrices is straightfor-
ward: Just combine the matrices by pressing « or |, as appropri-
ate. The second picture in Figure 17-2 illustrates this process.
• Multiplying two matrices: When finding the product A*B of two
matrices, the number of columns in the first matrix, A, must equal
the number or rows in the second matrix, B. If this condition isn’t
satisfied, you get an error message.
The multiplication of matrices is simple: Just indicate the product
by pressing p, as in the third picture in Figure 17-2.
Do not use juxtaposition (AB) to denote the product of two matri-
ces A and B. If you do, you will most likely get an error message
because the calculator interprets AB as being a single entity with a
two-letter name.
• Finding the inverse of a matrix: When finding the inverse of a
matrix, the matrix must be square (number of rows = number of
columns) and nonsingular (nonzero determinant). If it’s not, you
get an error message. (I explain evaluating the determinant of a
matrix in the next section.)
You enter the inverse of a matrix by entering the name of the matrix
and then pressing Z·¨, as in the first picture in Figure 17-3.
• Raising a matrix to an integral power: When finding the power of
a matrix, the matrix must be square. If it isn’t, you get an error
message.
To enter a power of a matrix, just enter the name of the matrix, press
Z, and enter the power, as in the second picture in Figure 17-3.
• Transposing a matrix: To transpose a matrix in an arithmetic
expression, enter the name of the matrix and then press 2zy¨
to select the Transpose (T) command from the MATH Matrix menu,
as illustrated in the third picture in Figure 17-3.

Chapter 17: Using Matrices

Finding Determinants and Eigenvalues
When finding the determinant, eigenvalues, or eigenvectors of a matrix, the
matrix must be square (the number of rows = the number of columns). If it
isn’t, you get an error message.
To find the determinant, eigenvalues, or eigenvectors of a square matrix,
follow these steps:
1. If necessary, press " to access the Home screen.
2. Press 2zy to display the MATH Matrix menu.
3. Press © to find the determinant of the matrix, press o to find the
eigenvalues, or press ÉÁ to find the eigenvectors.
Instead of pressing the number or letter of the desired option, you can
repeatedly press D to highlight the option and then press ¸.
4. Enter the name of the matrix and then press d.
To enter a letter in the name of the matrix, press É and then press
the key corresponding to the appropriate letter.
5. Press ¸ to evaluate the option you selected in Step 3.
This procedure is illustrated in Figure 17-4. In the first picture, the deter-
minant is displayed. In the second picture in this figure the eigenvalues
(–1 and –2) are displayed in a list and the corresponding eigenvectors
are displayed in columns. For example, in this picture, [1, 0] is an eigen-
vector corresponding to the eigenvalue –1.

Part VI: Dealing with Matrices 

Solving Systems of Equations
In the olden days (15 to 20 years ago) when computers and calculators were
very expensive and limited in their capabilities, if you wanted to find the
inverse of a matrix or solve a large system of equations, you had to perform
row operations on a matrix (such as adding a multiple of one row to another
row) to put the matrix in what is called reduced row-echelon form (rref). From
the rref form of the matrix, you could then read the inverse of the matrix or
the solutions to the system of equations (provided these entities existed).
With a TI-89 graphing calculator, there are, for the most part, easier ways of
finding the inverse of a matrix (as I explain earlier in this chapter) or of solv-
ing a system of equations (as I explain in Chapter 3). But when confronted
with the task of solving a system of three or more equations, it’s easier to use
matrices than it is to use the method explained in Chapter 3. This section
tells you how to do this.

Systems of linear equations can be solved by first putting the augmented
matrix for the system in rref form. The mathematical definition of rref isn’t
important here. It is simply an equivalent form of the original system of equa-
tions, which, when converted back to a system of equations, gives you the
solutions (if any) to the original system of equations.
For example, when the reduced row-echelon matrix in the first picture in
Figure 17-5 is converted to a system of equations, it gives the solutions x = –3,
y = 3, and z = 9. The matrix in the second picture in Figure 17-5 converts to the
system x – z = 0 and y – z = –2. This arrangement indicates that the system
has an infinite number of solutions — namely, all solutions in which x = z and
y = z – 2, where z is any real number. The third picture in Figure 17-5 illustrates
a system that has no solution — the last line of the matrix says that 0 = 1,
which is clearly impossible!
255
Chapter 17: Using Matrices

To solve a system of equations, follow these steps:
1. Define the augmented matrix in the Data/Matrix editor.
The augmented matrix for the system of equations is explained at the
beginning of this section. Chapter 16 explains how to define a matrix in
the Data/Matrix editor.
You can define the coefficient and solution matrices for the system of
equations and then augment these matrices to form the augmented
matrix. (For more about augmenting matrices, see Chapter 16.)
2. Press " to access the Home screen.
3. Press 2zyy to select the rref command from the MATH Matrix
menu.
4. Enter the name of the augmented matrix and then press d.
To enter a letter in the name of the matrix, press É and then press
the key corresponding to the appropriate letter.
5. Press ¸ to put the augmented matrix in reduced row-echelon form.
6. To find the solutions (if any) to the original system of equations, con-
vert the reduced row-echelon matrix to a system of equations.
The beginning of this section describes converting a reduced row-
echelon matrix to a system of equations.
Although the calculator allows you to solve systems of equations without
reducing them to reduced row-echelon form, if you have two or more systems
of equations that have the same coefficient matrix, you can solve them simul-
taneously by finding the rref form of the matrix formed by augmenting the
coefficient matrix and the solution matrices. Here’s an example:

Figure 17-6. The reduced row-echelon form of this matrix appears in the
second picture in the figure. The fourth column of the matrix in the second
picture tells us that the solution to the first system of equations is x = –3, y =
3, and z = 9; the fifth column shows that the solution to the second system is
x = 1, y = 2, and z = 3.

o you need to calculate the number of ways you can arrange six people
at a table or the number of ways you can select four people from a
group of six people? Or do you just need an unbiased way of selecting people
at random? If so, this is the chapter for you.
Permutations and Combinations
A permutation, denoted by nPr, answers the question “From a set of n different
items, how many ways can you select and order (arrange) r of these items?” A
combination, denoted by nCr, answers the question “From a set of n different
items, how many ways can you select (independent or order) r of these items?”
To evaluate a permutation or combination, follow these steps:
1. If necessary, press " to go to the Home screen.
2. Press 2zm to access the MATH Probability menu.
3. Press © to evaluate a permutation or press ª to evaluate a 
combination.
4. Enter the total number (n) of items in the set.
Use the number keys to enter a positive integer or press É and
enter a letter, as illustrated in Figure 18-1.
5. Press b and enter the number (r) of items to be selected from the set.
As with n, r can be a positive number or a letter.
6. Press d¸ to display the result (as shown in Figure 18-1).

Generating Random Numbers
When generating random numbers, you usually want to generate numbers
that are integers contained in a specified range, or decimal numbers that are
strictly between 0 and 1.
Generating random integers
To generate random integers that fall between the integers 1 and n or
between –n and –1, follow these steps:
1. If necessary, press " to go to the Home screen.
2. Press 2zmy to select rand from the MATH Probability menu.
3. Enter a value for n and then press d.
To generate random integers between 1 and n, use the number keys to
enter a positive integer for n. To generate integers between –n and –1,
enter a negative integer.
4. Press d¸ to generate the first random integer, and to generate
more random integers, repeatedly press ¸.
This is illustrated in the two pictures in Figure 18-2.
Pressing any key except ¸ stops the calculator from generating random
integers.

Chapter 18: Probability
Seeding the random number generator
If you’ve never used your calculator to gener-
ate random numbers, it spews forth the same
random numbers as a new calculator or a cal-
culator that has been reset to the factory
defaults. This defeats the purpose of generat-
ing random numbers. To prevent this from hap-
pening, press 2zm{ to select RandSeed
from the MATH Probability menu, enter any
number, and press ¸. The number you
enter is then used by the numerical routine in
the calculator to generate random numbers.
This process is called seeding the random
number generator.
However, occasionally you might want to gener-
ate the same random numbers as another cal-
culator or which your calculator previously
generated. Replicating an experiment is an
example of such an occasion. Setting RandSeed
to the same number each time you run the exper-
iment means that your calculator will generate
the same random numbers.

Dealing with Statistical Data
In This Chapter
 Entering data into the calculator
 Editing and sorting data 
 Saving and recalling data 
 Deleting data sets from memory
T
he calculator has many features that provide information about the data
that you’ve entered. The calculator can graph data as a scatter plot, his-
togram, or box plot. It can calculate the median and quartiles. It can even find
a regression model (curve fitting) for your data. It can do this and much,
much more. This chapter tells you how to enter your data into the calculator;
Chapter 20 shows you how to use the calculator to analyze that data.
Entering Data
What you use to enter statistical data into the calculator is the Data/Matrix
editor — a relatively large spreadsheet that can accommodate up to 99
columns (data lists). And each data list can handle a maximum of 999 entries.
Pictures of the Data/Matrix editor appear in Figure 19-1.
To use the Data/Matrix editor to enter and save your data, follow these steps:
1. Press O.
2. On the TI-89 Titanium, use the Arrow keys to highlight Data/Matri and
then press ¸. On the TI-89, press {.
On the TI-89 Titanium, you see the first picture in Figure 19-1; on the 
TI-89, you see a screen displaying the same information but in a different
location.

3. Press ª to enter a new data set. Then press D to select the default
Data type and select the folder in which to save your data.
If you haven’t defined a special folder for your data set, accept the
default (Main) folder, as illustrated in the second picture in Figure 19-1,
and go to the next step. If you have defined a special folder for your
data, press B and then press the number key that corresponds to that
folder.
4. Press D and key in a name for your data.
The name of your data set can consist of no more than eight characters,
and the first character must be a letter. The calculator is already in
Alpha Lock mode and is expecting your entries to be letters. I explain
Alpha mode and entering text in Chapter 1.
If you have a non-Titanium TI-89 calculator and you get symbols instead
of letters when you try to name your data set, you need to upgrade your
operating system. Chapter 21 tells you how to do this, but you don’t
need to do it right now. To continue entering your data, press M to
erase any symbols you entered, and then press 2É to put your
calculator in Alpha Lock mode.
5. Press ¸¸ to enter the Data/Matrix editor.
If you get an error message after pressing ¸, this means that the cal-
culator already contains a data set with the same name you entered in
Step 4. To rectify this situation, press ¸DD, key in a new name for
your data set, and then press ¸ twice.
You see a screen similar to the first picture in Figure 19-2, in which the
calculator has provided a spreadsheet and has highlighted the first-row,
first-column element.
You can adjust the width of the columns to display more than the default
three columns or to accommodate large entries. The column width tells
you how many characters can be displayed in each cell of the spread-
sheet. So, for example, if the entries in your data range from –10 to 10,
you need a column width of 3 to accommodate the negative sign and the
two digits in the number –10. The smallest allowable width is 3, and the
largest is 12; the default width is 6. To adjust the column width, press
ƒC¸B to display the allowable column widths. Then arrow to the
desired width and press ¸ twice.

6. Key in the value of the first entry in the first column and press ¸ to
store that value in the calculator. Key in the values of the next entry in
the first column and press ¸ to store that value in the calculator.
Continue to do this until all entries in the first column are defined to
your specifications, as illustrated in the second picture in Figure 19-2.
As you key in your value, the cursor moves to the command line. After
you press ¸, the cursor moves to the next cell in the column.
To quickly enter data that follows a sequential pattern (such as 1, 2, 3, . . . ,
100 or 1, 4, 9, 25, . . . , 81) or data that is derived from a formula (such as
2∗c1 or ln(c2)), see the next section, “Using formulas to enter data.”
7. Press ¥CB to move to the first cell in the next column and key in the
entries in the next column. Continue to do this until you’ve defined all
columns to your specifications, as illustrated in the third picture in
Figure 19-2.
As you defined each entry in your data set, it was automatically stored in the
memory of the calculator under the name you declared in Step 4. So you
don’t need to do anything else to ensure that your data has been saved. To
exit (quit) the Data/Matrix editor, press 2N or press 2O to return to
the application you were using prior to using the Data/Matrix editor.
Using formulas to enter data
If you had to enter data for each year in the 20th century, would you key in all
100 years of the century? Of course not — you’d use a formula to enter the
data for you. To use a formula to define your data, follow these steps:
1. After setting up the Data/Matrix editor, as I explain in the first five
steps in the preceding section, use the ABCD keys to highlight the
column heading of the column in which your data is to appear, as
illustrated in the first picture in Figure 19-3, where c1 is highlighted.
2. Enter the formula for that column and press ¸.
As you enter your formula, the cursor moves to the command line. After
you press ¸, the data determined by your formula is entered in the
column, and the first entry in the column is highlighted.
Figure 19-2:

data in the
Data/Matrix
editor.
267
Chapter 19: Dealing with Statistical Data

To enter a formula defining a sequence, as illustrated on the command
lines in the first two pictures in Figure 19-3, press 2zª¸ to select
the seq command from the Math List menu and enter the formula as a
function of one variable. Then press b and enter the variable you used
to define the formula. Then press b, enter the first value of the variable
in the formula, press b, and enter the last value of the variable. If the
variable is incremented by a number other than 1, press b and enter
the value of the increment, as illustrated on the command line in the
second picture in Figure 19-3, in which the variable x is incremented by
10. Finally, press d to close the parentheses and then press ¸ to
enter the data determined by this formula.
You can also enter a formula by referencing data housed in other columns,
as illustrated on the command line in the third picture in Figure 19-3. For
example, if you want the entries in column c2 to be twice those in column
c1, define c2 as 2∗c1. (To enter c1, press Éd¨.) If your formula refer-
ences more than one column, as illustrated on the command line in the
third picture in Figure 19-3, those columns must contain the same number
of entries. If they don’t, you get an error message.
Creating column titles
Imagine your dismay when you return to the data set you stored in the calcu-
lator last week and realize that you haven’t the slightest idea what the data
in the columns represent. You can avoid this problem easily by giving your
columns a title.
To create a column title, use the ABCD keys to place the cursor in the blank
cell above the column heading, as illustrated in the first picture in Figure 19-4.
Then press 2É to put the calculator in Alpha mode and key in your
title, as illustrated in the second picture in this figure. Finally, press ¸ to
insert the title above the column heading, as illustrated in the third picture in
this figure, and then press É to take the calculator out of Alpha mode.
Column titles can consist of as many characters as you want. The calculator
might not be able to fit the whole title in the title area, but if you place the
cursor on the title, the full title appears on the command line.

Recalling, Editing, and Sorting Data
Everyone makes mistakes now and then, so knowing how to recall and edit
data is a good idea. And if you don’t like sorting data by hand, you might as
well find out how to get the calculator to do it for you.
Recalling data
To recall a data set when you aren’t currently in the Data/Matrix editor, follow
these steps:
1. Press O. On the TI-89 Titanium, use the Arrow keys to highlight
Data/Matri and press ¸; on the TI-89, press {.
You’re confronted with three options, as illustrated in the first picture in
Figure 19-5 for the TI-89 Titanium. On the TI-89, you see a screen display-
ing the same information but in a different location.
2. If the data set you’re recalling is the last data set you entered in the
Data/Matrix editor, press ¨ and skip the remaining steps; otherwise,
press ©.
The OPEN menu appears, as shown in the second picture in Figure 19-5.
3. Press D. If you saved your data set in the Main folder, go to the next
step; otherwise, press B to display the folders housed in the memory
of the calculator, and then press the number key for the folder in
which your data set is stored.

Chapter 19: Dealing with Statistical Data

4. Press DB to display the list of data sets housed in the folder you
selected in Step 3 (see the third picture in Figure 19-5).
You most likely don’t have the same data sets stored in your calculator as
I have in mine, so the third picture in Figure 19-5 doesn’t look anything
like what you see on your calculator’s screen. But it does give you an idea
of what to expect after completing this step.
5. Repeatedly press D to highlight the name of your data set, and then
press ¸¸ to recall the data set.
To recall a data set when you’re currently in the Data/Matrix editor, press
ƒ¨ to select the Open command from the Tools menu. Then follow Steps 3
through 5 in this section.
Editing data
The calculator, with one exception, allows you to perform the following edit-
ing procedures: 
 Changing the value of an entry
 Erasing the contents of a column
 Inserting a cell, row, or column
 Deleting a cell, row, or column
The exception is: You cannot mess with a column that is defined by a formula.
(I explain using formulas to define a column earlier in this chapter.) But there
is an easy solution to this exception — just erase the formula that defines the
column. To do this, place the cursor on the column heading (cn where n is the
number of the column), press ¸, and then press M¸. The entries
in the column that were defined by the formula remain but are no longer gov-
erned by the formula. So you can now edit them as you please.
Here’s how you edit entries that are not (or are no longer) defined by a 
formula:
 Change the value of an entry: To do this, place the cursor on the entry
and press ¸ to place the entry on the command line. Then enter a
new value or press A and edit the original entry. When you’re finished,
press ¸ to save the new value in the calculator. (See Chapter 1 for
details on editing expressions.)
 Erase the contents of a column: To do this, place the cursor anywhere
in the column and then press 2ƒz to execute the Clear Column
command in the Util menu.
 Insert a cell: To do this, place the cursor in the cell that will appear
below the cell you want to insert and press 2ƒ¨¨ to execute the
270
Part VII: Dealing with Probability and Statistics 

Insert cell command in the Util menu. Then enter the value you want
to place in this cell and press ¸.
 Insert a row or column: To do this, place the cursor in the row or
column that will appear after the row or column you want to insert and
press 2ƒ¨© to insert a row or press 2ƒ¨ª to insert a column.
If you insert a row, the calculator places “undef” in the entries of the
row. Simply edit these entries, as I explain earlier in this section.
 Deleting a cell, row, or column: To do this, place the cursor in the cell,
row, or column, and then press 2ƒ©¨ to delete the cell, 2ƒ©©
to delete the row, or 2ƒ©ª to delete the column.
Sorting data
There are two ways in which you can sort data: 
 Sort a single column so that numbers are in numeric order and charac-
ters are in alphabetical order.
 Sort all columns in the data set by using one column as the “key”
column.
One exception exists: You can’t sort data that is defined by a formula. (I explain
using formulas to define a column earlier in this chapter.) But an easy solution
to this exception does exist — just erase the formula that defines the column.
To do this, place the cursor on the column heading (cn where n is the number
of the column), press ¸, and then press M¸. The entries in the
column that were defined by the formula remain but are no longer governed
by the formula. So you can now sort the data in the column.
Sorting a column
To sort a single column, place the cursor anywhere in the column, as illus-
trated in the first picture in Figure 19-6, and then press 2ƒª to execute
the Sort Column command in the Util menu. As illustrated in the second 
picture in Figure 19-6, the Sort Column command sorts numbers in numeric
order and characters in alphabetical order, with the numbers appearing first.

Chapter 19: Dealing with Statistical Data

Sorting all columns using one column as the “key”
Suppose that your data set is a grade book in which the first column contains
students’ first names, the second contains their last names, and the remaining
columns contain their test scores. You want to sort the data based on the stu-
dents’ last names. That is, you want to sort all columns by using the second
column as the “key” column. This method of sorting sorts the “key” column
and maintains the integrity of the row structure — that is, after sorting, the row
containing a student’s last name in the second column still has his first name in
the first column and his test scores in the remaining columns.
To sort all columns of your data set by using one column as the “key” column,
first place the cursor anywhere in the “key” column, as illustrated in the first
picture in Figure 19-7. Then press 2ƒy to execute the Sort Col, adjust all
command in the Util menu, as illustrated in the second picture in this figure.
Saving and Deleting Data Sets
Saving your data set is no big deal because the calculator automatically
saves it as you construct it. But after a while, those data sets build up in the
memory of the calculator. When it comes time to weed out some of those
data sets housed in memory, you can do it in two ways: You can transfer a
data set to your PC so you can recall it at a later time, or you can banish it to
cyberspace by deleting it from your calculator.
Chapter 21 tells you how to transfer a data set to your PC and how to send it
back to your calculator at a later date. Chapter 22 tells you how to transfer a
data set from one calculator to another calculator.
To delete data sets from your calculator’s memory, press 2| to display the
VAR-LINK screen. Then repeatedly press D to highlight the name of the data
set you want to delete. (Data sets have the extension DATA displayed to the
right of their names.) Then press † to place a checkmark next to it. Continue
this process until you have checked all the data sets you want to delete. Then
press ƒ¨¸ to delete the checked data sets.

n descriptive statistical analysis, you usually want to plot your data and
find the mean, median, standard deviation, and so on. You might also want
to find a regression model for your data (a process also called curve fitting).
This chapter tells you how to get the calculator to do these things for you.
Plotting One-Variable Data
The most common plots used to graph one-variable data are histograms and
box plots. In a histogram, the data is grouped into classes of equal size; a bar
in the histogram represents one class. The height of the bar represents the
quantity of data contained in that class, as in the first picture in Figure 20-1.
Histogram
Box plot
Modified box plot
Figure 20-1:
One-
variable
statistical
plots.

A box plot (as in the second picture in Figure 20-1) consists of a box-with-
whiskers. The box represents the data that exists between the first and third
quartiles. The box is divided into two parts, with the division line defined by
the median of the data. The whiskers represent the locations of the minimum
and maximum data points.
The third picture in Figure 20-1 illustrates both a standard box plot and a
modified box plot of the same data. In a modified box plot, the whiskers rep-
resent data in the range defined by 1.5(q3 – q1), and the outliers are plotted
as points beyond the whiskers.
If your data has outliers (data values that are much larger or smaller than the
other data values), consider constructing a modified box plot instead of a
box plot.
To construct a histogram, box plot, or modified box plot, follow these steps:
1. If necessary, press 3B¨¸ to put the calculator in Function
Graph mode.
2. Press ¥ƒ to enter the Y= editor, and then press ‡¨ to turn off all
functions and Stat Plots.
3. If you haven’t already done so, store your data in the calculator. If
your data is already stored in the calculator, recall it in the Data/
Matrix editor.
Chapter 19 tells you how to store data in the calculator and how to
recall it in the Data/Matrix editor.
4. Press „ to display the Plot Setup screen, use the D key to highlight the
Plot number you want to define, and then press ƒ to define the plot.
Your screen looks similar to the first picture in Figure 20-2 but without
the drop-down menu displayed. At the top of the screen is the folder and
data set you want to plot and the plot number in which this data is to be
plotted.
5. Press B to display the Plot Type drop-down window, as illustrated in
the first picture in Figure 20-2, and then press ª, y, or z to tell the
calculator you want to construct a box plot, histogram, or modified
box plot, respectively.
Figure 20-2:
Setting up
one-variable
statistical

274
Part VII: Dealing with Probability and Statistics 

6. If you’re constructing a box plot or histogram, skip this step and go to
Step 7. If you’re constructing a modified box plot, press DB and then
key in the number of the character you want to have the calculator
use to plot the outliers.
Here’s what your choices look like: Box (), Cross (×), Plus (+), Square
(), and Dot (ø). My recommendation is to go with Box. The dot is
barely visible on the screen.
7. Press D and enter the column heading (cn) that contains your data.
For example, if your data is in the first column, enter c1. The calculator
is already in Alpha mode, so, for example, you enter c1 by pressing d to
enter the letter c, then pressing É to take the calculator out of
Alpha mode, and finally pressing ¨.
8. If you’re graphing a box plot or a modified box plot, skip this step and
go to Step 9. If you’re graphing a histogram, press D and enter a value
for the bucket width.
The bucket width is the actual width of each bar in the graph of the his-
togram. That is, 
.
max
min
x
x
Hist Bucket Width
Number of bars
=
-
where xmax and xmin are respectively the largest and smallest values of
x appearing on the x-axis in the graph of the histogram.
If you set the bucket width equal to the class size (the difference between
consecutive lower class limits), some of your data points might occur on
the boundary between two bars. As an example, if your data consists of
test scores ranging from 50 to 100, and you group them into the typical
data classes (F: 50 – 59, D: 60 – 69, C: 70 – 79, B: 80 – 89, A: 90 – 100), then
when the bucket width equals the class size (which is 10), a test score of
60 is on the boundary between the first and second bars in the histogram. 
The only potential problem created by having a data point on the bound-
ary between two bars is that when you trace the histogram to determine
how many data points are in each bar, you must remember that a data
point on the boundary between two bars is counted in the bar on the
right. (I give you the lowdown on tracing a histogram later in this chap-
ter, in the section “Tracing Statistical Data Plots.”)
For the histograms in Figure 20-3, which plot test scores ranging from 50
to 100, I avoided the problem of data points occurring on the boundary
between two bars by setting xmin to 49.5 and setting xmax to 100.5.
Because the histogram consisted of 5 bars, I set the bucket width to
(100.5 – 49.5)/5 = 10.2, as illustrated in the second picture in Figure 20-2.
(xmin and xmax are Window settings, which you set in Step 12.)
9. Press DB. Do you want to use frequencies or categories? If NO, then
press ¨; if YES, press ©.
275
Chapter 20: Analyzing Statistical Data

The frequency of a data point is the number of times it occurs. This can
also be viewed as a weighted value indicating that data vary in their
degrees of importance. If the frequency of each data point is 1, you don’t
have to use frequencies because the calculator uses the default fre-
quency value of 1 when you don’t tell it to do otherwise.
Categories allow you to group your data into smaller subgroups, which
you can then plot. As an example, the first picture in Figure 20-3 shows a
histogram of test scores for all students, and the next two pictures in
this figure show the histograms for the two subgroups consisting of girls
and boys.
To create categories, assign a positive integer to each category and
store these values in a column in the Data/Matrix editor. For example, to
create the histograms in Figure 20-3 I stored the test scores in column
c1, and in column c2 I placed the number 1 next to the test score of a
female and the number 2 next to the score of a male student.
You can have as many categories as you want, and you can have the cal-
culator plot more than one category at a time. For example, if you have
test scores for two classes of students, you could assign the following
categories: 1 (first class, female), 2 (first class, male), 3 (second class,
female), and 4 (second class, male). Then to plot the test scores for just
the first class, you plot categories 1 and 2; to plot the test scores for the
male students in both classes, plot categories 2 and 4.
I put the letters and words in the pictures in Figure 20-3 by using the
Text Pen tool in the Graph window. If you’d like to do the same, the side-
bar in this chapter tells you how.
10. If you answered NO in the preceding step, skip this step and go to the
next. If you answered YES, press D and then do the following:
a. If you aren’t using frequencies, skip this step and go to Step b. If
you are using frequencies, enter the column heading (cn) that
contains the frequencies.
b. If you aren’t using categories, go to Step 11. If you are using cate-
gories, press D and enter the column heading (cn) containing
the categories.
Figure 20-3:
An example
of plotting
categories.
276
Part VII: Dealing with Probability and Statistics 

c. Press DBA to place the cursor inside the brackets in the Include
Categories field and then enter the numbers of the categories
you want to plot.
If you’re plotting more than one category, the numbers of the cat-
egories must be separated by commas. For example, to plot cat-
egories 1, 2, and 3, you place 1,2,3 inside the brackets.
11. Press ¸ twice.
You see a screen similar to the third picture in Figure 20-2, which shows
a summary of the plots stored in the calculator.
12. Put a checkmark next to the plots that you want to graph and leave
the others unchecked.
The calculator graphs only the plots that have checkmarks next to them.
For example, in the third picture in Figure 20-2, plots 3 and 5 are checked,
so they’ll be graphed; the others won’t be graphed. To change the
checked status of a plot, use the CD keys to highlight the plot and
then press † to change the checked status of the plot.
13. Press ¥„ to enter the Window editor and then press „o to have
ZoomData graph the data for you.
ZoomData doesn’t adjust the settings for the y-axis, so you might get a
graph as unpleasant-looking as the one in the first picture in Figure 20-4.
In addition, ZoomData might not give you the appropriate number of
bars in a histogram. You rectify these problems in the following step.
14. If necessary, press ¥„ to reenter the Window editor and then adjust
the settings in this editor to get a better view of your graph, as illus-
trated in the second picture in Figure 20-4.
If you’re graphing only box plots and modified box plots, you need to
adjust only the settings for ymin, ymax, and yscl. If you’re graphing a
histogram and didn’t get the expected number of bars in your graph,
you need to also adjust the settings for xmin, xmax, and xscl so they
agree with the way you set the bucket width in Step 8.
If in Step 8 you set the bucket width equal to the class size, set xmin equal
to the lower limit of the first class, xmax equal to the upper limit of the
last class, and xscl equal to the class size. If you used the formula in Step 8
to determine the bucket width, set xmin and xmax to the values you used
in this formula and set xscl equal to either the class size or the bucket
width.
If you’re planning to trace your Stat Plot, decrease the setting for ymin
so there’s room at the bottom of the screen for the calculator to display
its findings as it traces the graph. The basic rule is that the calculator
uses the bottom one-fourth of the graphing area when tracing your Stat
Plot, as illustrated in the third picture in Figure 20-4. If you don’t leave
room at the bottom of the screen, the calculator displays its findings on
top of your stat plot — and you might find this very annoying.

Chapter 20: Analyzing Statistical Data

Plotting Two-Variable Data
The most common plots used to graph two-variable data sets are the scatter
plot and the xy-line plot. A scatter plot plots the points (x, y) where x is a
value from one data list and y is the corresponding value from the other data
list. The xy-line plot is simply a scatter plot with consecutive points joined by
a straight line. 
To construct a scatter plot or an xy-line plot, follow these steps:
1. Follow Steps 1 through 4 in the preceding section with the following
difference:
If you’re graphing an xy-line plot, in Step 3, sort your data by using the
data for the x-coordinates of the data points as the “key” column. If you
don’t, your xy-line plot might look like the one in the third picture in
Figure 20-5. (I explain sorting data by using a “key” column in Chapter 19.)
2. Press B to display the Plot Type drop-down window, as illustrated in
the first picture in Figure 20-2, and then press ¨ or © to tell the calcu-
lator you want to construct a scatter plot or an xy-line plot.

Part VII: Dealing with Probability and Statistics 
Writing on a graph
Would you like to enhance your graph with
words describing what’s being graphed? If so,
here’s how you do it. While the graph is dis-
played on the screen, press 2„m to acti-
vate the Text Pen tool. Then move the cursor to
the location on the screen where the upper right
of the letter or symbol is to appear and press the
key that corresponds to the letter or symbol.
(Don’t forget to press É to insert a letter.)
The Text Pen tool remains active until you press
N, so while it’s active, you can move the
cursor to another location to write elsewhere
on the graph.
If you make a mistake while using this tool or if
you don’t like the location of your letter or
symbol, you can use the space key to erase it.
To do this, move the cursor to the upper right of
the letter or symbol and press É· (or just
· if you’re in Alpha Lock mode) to overwrite
the letter or symbol with a blank space.

3. Press DB and then key in the number of the character you want the
calculator to use to plot the data points.
Here’s what your choices look like: Box (), Cross (×), Plus (+), Square
(), and Dot (ø). I recommend using Box or Square. Don’t use Dot
unless you enjoy squinting.
4. Press D and enter the column heading (cn) that contains the data for
the x-coordinates of the data points. Then press D and enter the
column heading (cn) that contains the data for the y-coordinates of the
data points.
For example, if your data is in the first and second columns, enter c1,
press D, and enter c2. The calculator is already in Alpha mode, so, for
example, you enter c1 by pressing d to enter the letter c, then press
É to take the calculator out of Alpha mode, and finally press ¨.
After pressing D, press É to put the calculator back in Alpha mode,
press d to enter the letter c, then press É to take the calculator out
of Alpha mode, and finally press ©.
5. Follow Steps 9 through 14 in the preceding section.
Tracing Statistical Data Plots
To trace a statistical data plot, press … while the plot is displayed on the
screen. In the upper-right corner, you see the Stat Plot number (P1, P2, and
so on). If you have more than one Stat Plot on the screen, repeatedly press C
until the plot you want to trace appears in the upper-right corner.
Use the AB keys to trace the plot. What you see depends on the type of plot:
 Tracing a histogram: As you trace a histogram, the cursor moves from
the top center of one bar to the top center of the next bar. At the bottom
of the screen, you see the values of min, max, and n. This tells you that
there are n data points x such that min ≤x < max. This is illustrated in
the first picture in Figure 20-6.

Chapter 20: Analyzing Statistical Data

 Tracing a box plot: As you trace a box plot from left to right, the values
that appear at the bottom of the screen are minX (the minimum data
value), q1 (the value of the first quartile), Med (the value of the median),
q3 (the value of the third quartile), and maxX (the maximum data value).
 Tracing a modified box plot: As you trace a modified box plot from left
to right, the values that appear at the bottom of the screen are minX
(the minimum data value) and then the other outliers, if any, to the left
of the interval defined by 1.5(q3 – q1). The next value you see at the
bottom of the screen is the value of the left bound of the interval defined
by 1.5(q3 – q1). Then, as with a box plot, you see the values of the first
quartile, the median, and the third quartile. After that, you see the value
of the right bound of the interval defined by 1.5(q3 – q1), the outliers to
the right of this, if any, and finally maxX (the maximum data value). This
is illustrated in the second picture in Figure 20-6.
 Tracing a scatter plot or an xy-line plot: As you trace a scatter plot or
an xy-line plot, the coordinates of the cursor location appear at the
bottom of the screen, as illustrated in the third picture in Figure 20-6.
Analyzing Your Data
The calculator can perform one- and two-variable statistical data analysis. For
one-variable data analysis, the statistical data variable is denoted by x. For
two-variable data analysis, the data variable for the first data list is denoted by
x, and the data variable for the second data list is denoted by y. Table 20-1
lists the variables calculated by using one-variable data analysis (One-Var), as
well as those calculated by using two-variable analysis (Two-Var).

Analyzing one- and two-variable data
To analyze one- or two-variable data, follow these steps:
1. If you haven’t already done so, store your data in the calculator. If
your data is already stored in the calculator, recall it in the
Data/Matrix editor.
Chapter 19 tells you how to store data in the calculator and how to
recall it in the Data/Matrix editor.
2. Press ‡ to display the Calculate screen and then press B to display
the Calculation Type drop-down window, as illustrated in the first pic-
ture in Figure 20-7.
At the top of the screen, you see the folder and name of the data set you
want to analyze.
3. If necessary, repeatedly press D to highlight the appropriate item and
then press ¸ to select that item.
To analyze one-variable data, highlight item 1; to analyze two-variable
data, highlight item 2.
4. Press D and enter the column heading (cn) that contains the data for
the x-values of your data. If you’re analyzing one-variable data, go to
the next step. If you’re analyzing two-variable data, press D and then
enter the column heading (cn) that contains the data for the y-value of
your data.
For example, if you’re analyzing two-variable data and your data are in
the first and second columns of the Data/Matrix editor, enter c1, press
281
Chapter 20: Analyzing Statistical Data

D, and enter c2. The calculator is already in Alpha mode, so you enter
c1, for example, by pressing d to enter the letter c, then press É to
take the calculator out of Alpha mode, and finally press ¨. After press-
ing D, press É to put the calculator back in Alpha mode, press d to
enter the letter c, and then press ©.
5. Press DB. Do you want to use frequencies or categories? If NO, then
press ¨; if YES, then press ©.
For a detailed explanation of frequencies and categories, see Step 9 in
the first section, “Plotting One-Variable Data,” in this chapter.
6. If you answered NO in the preceding step, skip this step and go Step 7.
If you answered YES, press D and then do the following:
a. If you aren’t using frequencies, skip ahead to Step b. If you are
using frequencies, enter the column heading (cn) that contains
the frequencies.
b. If you aren’t using categories, go to Step 7. If you are using cate-
gories, press D and enter the column heading (cn) that contains
the categories.
c. Press DBA to place the cursor inside the brackets in the Include
Categories field and then enter the numbers of the categories
you want to use.
If you’re analyzing more than one category, the numbers of the cat-
egories must be separated by commas. For example, to analyze
categories 1, 2, and 3, you place 1,2,3 inside the brackets.
d. Press ¸ to save the last entry you made.
7. Press ¸ to display the analysis of your data, as illustrated in the
second picture in Figure 20-7. When you’re finished viewing this dis-
play, press ¸ to return to the Data/Matrix editor.
After you press ¸ the first time, you see a screen similar to the
second picture in Figure 20-7, which — with the exception of the popula-
tion standard deviations (σx and σy) — shows the values of statistical
variables listed in Table 20-1. Not all the statistical variables fit on this
screen, as indicated by the down arrow in the last entry in the second
picture in Figure 20-7. To see the statistical variables not displayed,
repeatedly press D until they appear.
The next section tells you how to find the values of the population stan-
dard deviations. It also tells you how to use all statistical variables listed
in Table 20-1 in a mathematical expression.
While the calculator is in the Data/Matrix editor, you can press 2„ to redis-
play the results of the last one- or two-variable statistical analysis displayed
by the calculator. If the calculator no longer has the results of that analysis
stored in its memory, you get an error message when you press 2„.
282
Part VII: Dealing with Probability and Statistics 

Using statistical variables in calculations
Perhaps you need to use the value of a statistical variable in a mathematical
expression (see the third picture in Figure 20-7), or maybe you want to display
the values of the population standard deviations on the Home screen. If so, you
must be able to enter the symbols σ, ü, ý, and Σ into the calculator, and you
need to know how to enter lower- and uppercase letters. No sweat! Chapter 1
tells you how to use the É and ¤ keys to enter variables such as q1 and
minX. The following tells you how to enter the symbols σ, ü, ý, and Σ:
 To enter σ: Press 2«¸ to display the Greek CHAR menu, repeat-
edly press D to highlight item G, and then press ¸.
To, for example, display the value of σx on the Home screen, as illus-
trated in the first entry in the third picture in Figure 20-7, enter σ and
then press Ù¸.
The shortcut keystrokes for entering σ are ¥c¤ª. Although these key-
strokes give you no clue as to why you’re pressing them, they’re well
worth remembering if you frequently find yourself in need of knowing
the values of the population standard deviations σx and σy, which (for
reasons that baffle me) don’t appear on the Calculate screen, as illus-
trated in the second picture in Figure 20-7.
 To enter Σ: On the Home screen, press …y to enter Σ( and then press
0 to erase the left parenthesis.
For example, to display the value of Σx on the Home screen, as illus-
trated in the fourth entry in the third picture in Figure 20-7, press
…y0Ù¸.
To enter Σ when you aren’t on the Home screen, you can use the short-
cut keystrokes ¥cÉª.
 To enter ü and ý: Press 2«© to enter the Math CHAR menu, repeatedly
press D to highlight item A for ü or item B for ý, and then press ¸.
As an example, the keystrokes I used to display the value of ü in the
third entry in the third picture in Figure 20-7 are 2«©ÉÁ¸.

Regression Models
Regression modeling is the process of finding a function that approximates
the relationship between the two variables in a two-variable data set. (An
example appears in Figure 20-8, in which a straight line approximates the
relationship between the two variables.) Table 20-2 shows the types of regres-
sion models the calculator can compute.

To compute a regression model for your two-variable data, follow these
steps:
1. Follow Steps 1 through 4 in the section titled “Analyzing one- and two-
variable data,” earlier in this chapter. In Step 3 select the appropriate
regression model. 
The first picture of Figure 20-8 illustrates that the linear regression
model was selected in Step 3.
2. Press DB, use the D key to highlight a function in which to store the
regression equation, and then press ¸ to select that function.
If the function you select is already defined in the Y= editor, that defini-
tion is replaced with the regression equation.
284
Part VII: Dealing with Probability and Statistics 

3. If you aren’t using frequencies or categories, press ¸ to display
the regression formula, as illustrated in the second picture in Figure
20-8. If you are using frequencies or categories, follow Steps 5 through
7 in the section titled “Analyzing one- and two-variable data,” earlier
in this chapter, to display the regression formulas.
For a detailed explanation of frequencies and categories, see Step 9 in
the first section (“Plotting One-Variable Data”) in this chapter.
As illustrated in the second picture in Figure 20-8, the calculator displays
the equation for the model you selected and gives the values of the coef-
ficients in this equation. It also gives the values of the correlation coeffi-
cient (Corr) and the coefficient of determination (R2).
4. Graph your data and regression model, as illustrated in the third pic-
ture in Figure 20-8.
To do this, follow the directions given in the earlier section, “Plotting
Two-Variable Data.” If the regression model does not display with your
data, press ¥ƒ to enter the Y= editor, use the D key to highlight the
function you selected in Step 2, and press † to place a checkmark next
to it. Then press ¥… to graph the data and regression model.

Communicating
with PCs and
Other Calculators

In this part . . .
T
his part gets you ready to transfer files between your
calculator and a PC, or between your calculator and
another calculator. I also tell you how to download and
install the free TI Connect software you can use to (among
other things) transfer files to and from your PC.

Chapter 21
Communicating with a PC
Using TI Connect™
In This Chapter
 Downloading the TI Connect software
 Installing and running the TI Connect software
 Connecting your calculator to your computer
 Transferring files between your calculator and your computer
 Upgrading the calculator’s operating system
You need two things to enable your calculator to communicate with your
computer: TI Connect (software) and a TI-Graph Link cable. TI Connect
is free; the TI-Graph Link cable isn’t. If the cable didn’t come bundled with
your calculator, you can purchase one at the Texas Instruments online store
at www.education.ti.com. 
Downloading TI Connect
The TI Connect software is on the TI Resource CD that most likely came with
your calculator. However, the version on this CD might not be current. The
following steps tell you how to download the current version of TI Connect
from the Texas Instruments Web site, as it existed at the time this book was
published:
1. Go to the Texas Instruments Web site (www.education.ti.com).
2. In the Know What You’re Looking For? drop-down list, select TI
Connect.
3. Click Downloads in the column on the left side of the screen.
4. Click either the Download Latest TI Connect for Windows or the
Download Latest TI Connect for Mac link.
If you haven’t already logged into the TI Web site, the Login page appears.
(If you’ve logged in, go to Step 6.)

5. If you’re already a member, enter your e-mail address and password
and then click the Login button. If you’re not a member, sign up —
it’s free.
To sign up as a member, click New User Registration and follow the
directions. TI might ask you a lot of questions, but registering gives you
access to a plethora of free stuff — such as TI Connect and the calcula-
tor programs I tell you about in Chapter 23.
6. Click the appropriate language.
7. Follow the directions given during the downloading process. 
Make a note of the directory in which you save the downloaded TI
Connect file on your PC so you’ll know where to find it when you want to
install it on your PC, as I explain in the next section.
Installing and Running TI Connect
After you’ve downloaded TI Connect, you install it by double-clicking the
downloaded TI Connect file you saved on your computer. Then follow the
directions given by the installation program you just launched.
When you start the TI Connect program, you see the many subprograms it
contains. To see what these subprograms are used for, click the Help button
in the lower-right corner of the screen. In this chapter, I explain how to use TI
Device Explorer to transfer files between your calculator and your PC.
Each of the subprograms housed in TI Connect has excellent Help menus that
tell you exactly how to use the program.
Connecting Calculator and Computer
To connect your calculator to your computer, you use the TI-Graph Link
cable that came with your calculator. If you don’t have a TI-Graph Link cable,
you can purchase one at the Texas Instruments online store at www.
education.ti.com.
There are four types of Link cables. Three of them work with all TI-89 calcula-
tors: the gray serial cable, the black serial cable, and the silver USB cable.
The fourth type, the black USB-to-USB cable, works only with the TI-89
Titanium and came bundled with the calculator. (It’s the USB-to-USB cable
that has differently sized ends.) Because the ends of all four of these cables
have different shapes and sizes, you can easily figure out how to connect
290
Part VIII: Communicating with PCs and Other Calculators 

your calculator to your computer. The small end fits in a slot located at the
bottom of the TI-89 or in a slot at the top of a TI-89 Titanium. The other end
plugs into one of your computer’s serial or USB ports.
Transferring Files
After you’ve connected the calculator to your computer, the TI Device
Explorer program housed in TI Connect can transfer files between the two
devices. This allows you to archive calculator files on your computer. 
To transfer files between your calculator and PC, start the TI Connect soft-
ware and click the TI Device Explorer program. A directory appears, listing
the folders housed in your calculator. Expanding these folders works the
same on your calculator as on your computer. From this directory, you can
do the following:
 To copy or move files from your calculator to your PC, highlight the
files you want to transfer, click File, and then choose either Copy to PC
or Move to PC. When the Choose Folder window appears, select the
location to which your files will be transferred and click Select.
 To copy files to the calculator from a PC running Windows, you don’t
need to be in the TI Device Explorer program. Instead, here’s what you do: 
1. Open Windows Explorer.
2. Highlight the files you want to copy. 
3. Right-click the highlighted files and then click Send To TI Device.
4. When asked whether you want the files sent to RAM or Archive,
select RAM if you plan to edit the file; otherwise, select Archive,
where it cannot be edited or inadvertently deleted.
The Help menu in TI Device Explorer is packed with useful information. In it,
you can find directions for editing and deleting calculator files and directions
for backing up all the files on your calculator.
Upgrading the OS
Texas Instruments periodically upgrades the operating systems of the TI-89
family of calculators. To upgrade the operating system, start the TI Connect
software and click the TI Device Explorer program. Click the Help menu at the
top of the screen, and then click TI Device Explorer Help. In the column on the
left, double-click Updating TI Software, and then click Updating Operating
Systems with TI OS Downloader. After that, just follow the on-screen directions.

Chapter 22
Communicating between
Calculators
In This Chapter
 Linking calculators to transfer files
 Determining what files you can transfer
 Selecting files to transfer
 Transferring files between calculators
You can transfer data lists, programs, matrices, and other such files from
one calculator to another if you link the calculators with the unit-to-unit
Calculator Link cable that came bundled with your calculator. This chapter
describes how to make such transfers.
Linking Calculators
Linked calculators can share information — a real bonus if you want to trans-
fer data from one calculator to another. You can link calculators by using the
unit-to-unit Calculator Link cable that came bundled with the calculator. If
you’re no longer in possession of the cable, you can purchase one at the
Texas Instruments online store at www.education.ti.com.
Two types of unit-to-unit Calculator Link cables exist: One has two cylindri-
cally shaped plugs on each end (I/O-to-I/O), and the other has two small rec-
tangular ends of the same size (USB-to-USB). The one that comes bundled
with the TI-89 Titanium is the USB-to-USB cable. At the time this book was
written, the USB-to-USB cable can link only two TI-89 Titanium calculators.
The other cable (I/O-to-I/O) can be used to link any two calculators of the fol-
lowing type: TI-89, TI-89 Titanium, TI-92, TI-92 Plus, and Voyage 200.

To link two TI-89 Titanium calculators, plug the USB-to-USB cable into the
ports on the top right of each calculator. To link the other types of calculators,
plug each end of the I/O-to-I/O cable into the only hole in which they fit — this
hole is located either at the top or bottom of the calculator.
If you get an error message when transferring files from one calculator to
another using the I/O-to-I/O cable, the most likely cause is that the unit-to-
unit cable isn’t fully inserted into the port of one calculator.
Transferring Files
You can transfer files between your TI-89 and another TI-89, TI-89 Titanium, 
TI-92, TI-92 Plus, or Voyage 200, provided you have the appropriate unit-to-unit
Calculator Link cable (as I explain in the preceding section). To transfer files
from the sending calculator to the receiving calculator, follow these steps:
1. Press 2| on the sending calculator to access the VAR-LINK menu.
The VAR-LINK menu appears in the first picture in Figure 22-1.
2. Use the C and D keys to highlight the file you want to send and press
† to place a checkmark to the left of that file. 
Repeat this procedure for each file you want to send.
Only those files that have been checked will be sent to another calcula-
tor. The second picture in Figure 22-1 shows three selected files that are
waiting to be sent to another calculator.
To place a checkmark to the left of all files in the calculator, press ‡¨.
To check all files in a single folder, as in the third picture in Figure 22-1,
use the C and D keys to highlight the name of the folder and press †.

3. On the receiving calculator, press 2|…©.
At the bottom of the screen you see the message VAR-LINK: WAITING TO
RECEIVE.
Always put the receiving calculator in Receiving mode before you trans-
fer files from the sending calculator.
4. On the sending calculator, press …¨ to send the files to the receiving
calculator.
As files are transferred, on the receiving calculator you might see a
screen similar to the first picture in Figure 22-2 indicating that the receiv-
ing calculator already has a file with the same name as the one being
transferred. If you want to overwrite this file with the one being trans-
ferred, press ¸. If not, press B and then press the number of the
desired option in the Duplicate File menu, as illustrated in the second
picture in Figure 22-2. Then press ¸ to execute your selection.
The third option (NO) in the Duplicate File menu affords you the oppor-
tunity to rename the file that is being transmitted, as illustrated in the
third picture in Figure 22-2. To do this, press D and key in a new name.
Because the calculator is already in Alpha mode, you don’t need to press
É before entering each letter — just press the key that has the
appropriate letter above it. After entering the new filename, press ¸
twice; once to confirm the new filename, and again to transfer the newly
renamed file. If there is already a file in the calculator with the same
name as your newly named file, you get the Duplicate File menu again. In
this case, just give the file a different name.
5. When you’re finished transferring files, press N to exit the VAR-
LINK menu.
If you want to terminate the transfer of files while it is in progress, press ´
on either calculator. Then press N when you’re confronted with the Link
transmission error message. If you put one calculator in Receiving mode and
then decide not to transfer any files to that calculator, press ´ to take it out
of Receiving mode.

Chapter 22: Communicating between Calculators

Transferring Files to Several Calculators
After transferring files between two calculators, you can then use the sending
calculator to transfer the same files to a third calculator without having to
reselect the files. To do this, simply link the two calculators, press 2|…©
on the third calculator, and then press …¨ on the sending calculator. And if
you first select the newly transmitted files on the third calculator (as I
describe in Step 2 in the preceding section), you can then use that calculator
to send files to yet another calculator.

of your calculator, and briefly describe ten of my favorite
applications. I also list the most common errors that

Ten Great Applications
In This Chapter
 Reviewing ten applications for the calculator
 Finding and downloading applications
T
he Texas Instruments Web site has about two dozen applications that you
can download and install on your calculator. Most of these application
programs are free, and those that aren’t free are very inexpensive.
Texas Instruments already might have installed some of these applications on
your calculator — even some that aren’t available on its Web site for free. To
see what applications are already on your calculator, press O.
In the following section, I briefly describe ten great applications you can
download from the Texas Instruments Web site. At the end of this chapter, I
tell you how to find, download, and install those programs.
Ten Great Applications
Here are ten great applications you can download from the Texas Instruments
Web site (www.education.ti.com):
 Cabri Jr.: This is an interactive, dynamic geometry program that allows
you to export geometric figures between the calculator and the Cabri
Geometry II Plus software for Windows.
 Calculus Tools: This is a must-have application for calculus students —
and teachers, too. Not only does it contain operations not found on the
calculator (like grad, div, and curl), but it also allows you to interac-
tively investigate calculus applications (such as Riemann sums and
Newton’s method). This application can even do the Ratio test.
 CellSheet: This application turns your calculator into a spreadsheet. If
you also download the free TI CellSheet Converter software, you can
transfer your spreadsheet files between your calculator and Microsoft
Excel or Appleworks.

 The Geometer’s Sketchpad: This application is the calculator version of
the well-known PC software. It doesn’t have all the bells and whistles
that the PC version has, but it will do the geometry you need to do.
 Notefolio: Download this application if you want to turn your calculator
into a word processor. And while you’re at it, download the Notefolio
Creator software so you can transfer files between your calculator and
Microsoft Word. This application is most useful on the TI-92 and Voyage
200 because these calculators have a keyboard. If you have a TI-89 or fat
fingers, I suggest purchasing a TI Keyboard so you can key in words the
way you do on a computer.
 Organizer: This application is a personal organizer that you can use to
schedule events, create to-do lists, and save phone numbers and e-mail
addresses.
 Statistics with List Editor: The stat options built into the TI-89 are wimpy
compared to what you get with the Statistics with List Editor application.
For a college-level stat course, this is a must-have application.
 StudyCards: This application creates electronic flash cards. Be sure also
to download the free TI StudyCard Creator software that allows you to
create the flash cards on your PC.
 Symbolic Math Guide: This application helps students with various
topics (including algebra, pre-calculus, and calculus) by having them
interactively do various problems step by step.
 TI-Reader: Want to read The Scarlet Letter on your calculator? Or would
you like your calculator to function as a dictionary? If so, download 
this application. And while you’re about it, download the TI-Reader
Converter — it gets your PC to convert ebooks into something your 
calculator can display. And after you’ve done that, Google “free ebooks”
so you can download something to read.
Downloading an Application
The following steps tell you how to download application programs from the
Texas Instruments Web site as of the time this book was published. To down-
load and install applications, follow these steps:
1. Go to the Texas Instruments Web site at www.education.ti.com.
2. In the Know What You’re Looking For? drop-down list, click Apps and
OS Versions.
3. Click the link that matches the type of calculator you have.
300
Part IX: The Part of Tens 

4. Click the application you want to download.
5. Click Download Instructions in the left column of the screen and read
the instructions on how to download your application.
The download instructions are the same for each application, so you
need read the instructions only once. After reading them, close the
window containing these instructions.
6. Click Download under the picture of the calculator screen and follow
the directions you’re given. 
As you follow these directions, you are asked to accept the License
Agreement and log in. If you aren’t a member of the site, sign up —
it’s free. 
Make a note of the directory in which you save the downloaded applica-
tion on your PC so you’ll know where to find it when you want to install
it on your calculator, as I explain in the next section.
Installing an Application
To install applications on your calculator, you need the TI Connect software
and a TI-Graph Link cable. See Chapter 21 for information on downloading
and installing the software and connecting your calculator to your PC by
using the TI-Graph Link cable. You can also find directions for copying the
application file to your calculator in Chapter 21.

Ten Common Errors and Messages
In This Chapter
 Common errors made by first-time users
 Common errors made by experienced users
 Common error messages that leave you baffled
E
ven the best calculating machine is only as good as its input. Everyone
makes mistakes, and when you make a mistake on the calculator, you
usually get an error message. This chapter tells you how to avoid eight of the
most common errors made on the calculator as well as how to interpret ten
of the most common and baffling error messages.
Eight Great Ways to Mess Up
Here’s a list of eight common errors made when using the calculator, as well
as explanations of what happens when you make such errors:
 Using | instead of · to indicate that a number is negative: If you
press | instead of · at the beginning of an entry, the calculator
assumes that you want to subtract what comes after the minus sign
from the previous answer. If you use | instead of · in the interior of
an expression to denote a negative number, the calculator responds
with the “Syntax” error message.
 Not properly indicating the order of operations: When evaluating
expressions, the order of operations is crucial. To the calculator, for
example, –32 equals –9. If you were expecting the answer to be 9, I sug-
gest consulting Chapter 2 for a refresher on the order of operations.
According to this order of operations, the calculator, where appropriate,
first simplifies what’s in parentheses, then squares the result, and then
performs the operation of negation. So to the calculator, –32 = –9,
whereas (–3)2 = 9. 

Also, when graphing rational functions, users who are new to the calcu-
lator often make the basic mistake of omitting the parentheses that must
be used to set the numerator apart from the denominator.
 Improperly using implied multiplication: Implied multiplication is
when you omit the times sign in an expression such a 2sin(π). There are
times when this is okay with the calculator, such as with 2sin(π), and
there are times when it isn’t, such as with xsin(π). The reason is because
the calculator allows names of objects to consist of more than one letter.
So to the calculator, xsin is a four-letter name. To be on the safe side, use
the times sign instead of implied multiplication.
 Not clearing the contents of one-letter variables before starting a new
problem: If, for example, you previously stored the number 4 in the vari-
able a and then at a later date try to solve the equation x2 – 4x + a = 0,
the calculator gives the unexpected answer of 2 if you don’t first clear
the value 4 from the one-letter variable a. Because we quickly forget
what we’ve stored in the one-letter variables, be sure to always press
2ƒ¨ (which clears a through z) before starting a new problem on
the Home screen. 
 Not properly entering the arguments of a function: If the arguments are
improperly entered, you get an error message. As an example, if you
enter (2x) to integrate 2x, you get the “Too few arguments” error mes-
sage because this function requires two arguments: the function being
integrated and the independent variable. The Cheat Sheet attached at
the front of this book shows the proper form for entering the arguments
of some of the most common functions that require more than one 
argument.
 Entering an angle in degrees when the calculator is in Radian mode:
Actually, you can do so legitimately, but you have to let the calculator
know that you’re overriding the Angle mode by pressing 2Í to place a
degree symbol after your entry. 
 Improperly setting the Window: If you get the “Window variables
domain” error message when graphing functions, this is most likely
caused by setting xmin ≥xmax or by setting ymin ≥ymax in the
Window editor. Chapter 5 has the details on setting the Window editor.
 Improperly setting the Complex Format in the Mode menu: The
Complex Format item in the Mode menu, accessed by pressing
3DDDDDB, gives you three choices: Real, Rectangular, and
Polar. If you don’t want numbers displayed in polar form, set the
Complex Format to Rectangular — even if you deal exclusively with
real numbers. Reason: The rectangular format displays real numbers
in the normal fashion, and it also displays complex numbers in the
form a + bi.

Ten Baffling Error Messages
Most error messages you get make perfect sense, such as those that say
“Argument must be a decimal number” or “No solution found.” In a perfect
world, all error messages would make sense. But in the world of the small 
TI-89 screen, some error messages are abbreviated to the point where they
might leave you baffled. Or you might understand the message but be clue-
less about how to solve the problem. Here are ten baffling messages you
might encounter:
 Bound: You get this message when you incorrectly set the Lower Bound
to be larger than the Upper Bound when using a function in the Graph
Math menu. You can rectify the problem by starting over and properly
setting these bounds.
 Break: You get this message when you press ´ to stop a calculation or
to stop graphing. All this message really tells you is that the calculator
has successfully stopped doing whatever it was doing.
 Data type: This type of error occurs if, for example, you enter a negative
number when the calculator requires a positive number.
 false: This isn’t actually an error message, but it is baffling. Basically, it
says that the calculator can’t do what you asked it to do. For example,
you get this result when you use the solve command to solve an equa-
tion that contains complex numbers or to solve an equation with com-
plex solutions. To solve such equations, use the cSolve command.
 Link transmission: This message pops up when you’re attempting to
transfer data between two calculators. You get this message for one of
two reasons: The cable linking the calculators isn’t firmly set, or you had
one calculator send the data before you instructed the other calculator
to receive the data. To rectify this problem, check the cable connecting
the calculators and then resend the data, making sure to set the receiv-
ing calculator to Receive before you set the sending calculator to Send.
 Missing (: This message usually means exactly what it says — you
haven’t properly closed all parentheses. But you also get this message
when you try to store an expression in a function name used by the 
calculator. For example, you get this message when you try to store a
number in the variable max. When this happens, just use a different
name for your variable.
 Non-real result: Although this message makes perfect sense, it might
leave you baffled about fixing the problem. This message usually occurs
when the Complex Format in the Mode menu is set to Real. If you set it
to Rectangular — by pressing 3DDDDDB — and reevaluate your
expression, you should get the desired results.
305
Chapter 24: Ten Common Errors and Messages

 Singular matrix: You get this message when your expression explicitly
or implicitly refers to the inverse of a singular matrix — that is, a matrix
whose determinate is zero. Because the inverse of such a matrix doesn’t
exist, whatever you asked the calculator to do before getting this message
is mathematically impossible.
 Syntax: This is the catch-all of all catch-all error messages. When evalu-
ating expressions, this message usually means that you didn’t properly
enter the expression — maybe you did something haphazard like press-
ing | instead of · to indicate that a quantity is negative. When storing
a number in a variable name, this message usually means that the name
you chose is reserved by the calculator. For example, storing a number
in disp gives you this message. In this case, just use a different name.
 Window variables domain: This error message tells you that the current
Window settings are preventing the calculator from doing what you’re
asking it to do. If you get this message when you’re trying to graph some-
thing, the problem is usually caused by setting xmin to be greater than
xmax or setting ymin greater than ymax.
If you get this message when using a command in the Graph Math menu,
the problem is caused by entering an argument that isn’t contained
within the Window settings. For example, using the value command to
evaluate the graphed function at x = 11 when xmin = –10 and xmax = 10
in the Window editor gives you this error message because 11 is not
between –10 and 10.

A
re you sick of all those keystrokes needed to find often-used commands
lurking deep in the submenu structure of the MATH menu? Have you
often felt that your life would be easier if TI had a single command for the
keystrokes that you use to complete the same task over and over again? Or
are you just tired of having to remember where things are located on the cal-
culator? If so, a Custom menu is the solution to your problems.
As the name indicates, a Custom menu is a menu that replaces the Toolbar
menu on the Home screen with the commands of your choice. It can even
house the programs you write to save keystrokes when performing an often-
repeated task. I create a Custom menu for each class I teach so that I don’t
have to keep reminding students where to find things on the calculator.
Figure A-1 shows one of my Custom menu creations. 
The calculator has a Default Custom menu, as illustrated in the second pic-
ture in Figure A-1. Press 2" to check it out and then press 2"
again to return to the Toolbar menu, as illustrated in the first picture in
Figure A-1. If you’d like to create your own Custom menu, be sure to check
out this appendix.

Creating and Using a Custom Menu
As Figure A-2 shows, a Custom menu is a program that has a specified format
consisting of blocks of code. The first block gives the name of the menu and
tells the calculator that it is a program for a Custom menu. The interior
blocks tell the calculator the names to give the Function keys (ƒ, „, and
so on) and which commands (items) to place in the submenus accessed by
these keys. The last block (EndCustm and EndPrgm) tells the calculator that
you’re finished constructing the Custom menu.
Creating a Custom menu isn’t as difficult as it looks, but it does take time
to key in all those words on a TI-89. A timesaving alternative is to create the
menu on a PC and then transfer it to your calculator. The sidebar in this
chapter tells you how to download and use the (free) software needed to
create the menu on your PC, and Chapter 21 tells you how to transfer that
menu from your PC to your calculator. Of course, you need a cable that links
your calculator to your PC. Such a cable most likely came with your calcula-
tor. If not, you can purchase one at the Texas Instruments online store at
http://education.ti.com/us/product/main.html.
Creating a Custom menu on the calculator
To create a Custom menu on your calculator, follow these steps:
1. Press O and select the Program editor. Then press ª to tell that
calculator that you’re creating a new program.
2. Press DD and enter the name of your program, as illustrated in the
first picture in Figure A-3.
A calculator equipped with a current operating system is in Alpha Lock
mode waiting for you to enter letters. The name you give your Custom
menu can consist of no more than eight letters or numbers, the first of
which must be a letter. You find out about entering letters, numbers, and
symbols in Chapter 1.

TI-89 Graphing Calculator For Dummies 

If you get symbols when you try to enter letters, you need to upgrade
your operating system. Chapter 21 tells you how to do this, but you don’t
need to do it right now. Simply press 2É to put the calculator in
Alpha Lock mode and upgrade the operating system when convenient.
3. Press ¸ twice.
You see a screen similar to the second picture in Figure A-3.
4. Press DD„m to tell the calculator you’re creating a Custom menu
and then press ¸ to leave a space between lines, as shown in the
third picture in Figure A-3.
5. While the calculator is in Alpha Lock, enter the word title, press · to
enter a space, press 2¨ to start a quote, enter the name of the sub-
menu that will be accessed when you press ƒ, press 2¨ to end the
quote, and then press ¸ (see the first picture in Figure A-4).
6. With Alpha Lock engaged, enter the word item, press · to enter a
space, and then press 2¨ to start a quote, as illustrated in the
second picture in Figure A-4).
If you so choose, you can select the words title and item from the
CATALOG. Chapter 1 tells you how to do this.
7. Enter the command for this item, press 2¨ to end the quote, and
then press ¸, as illustrated in the third picture in Figure A-4.
To enter a command from a calculator menu, simply select the com-
mand from the appropriate calculator menu and then press ¸. For
example, the command abs( in the third picture in Figure A-4 was placed
there by pressing 2z¨©.
To enter a command that is a function or program of your creation,
simply key in its name. I explain creating functions and programs later in
this chapter.
8. Repeat Step 7 until you’ve defined all items that appear in the submenu.
An example of this procedure appears in the first two pictures of
Figure A-2, in which the submenu titled Misc has eight items.
Figure A-3:

309
Appendix: Creating Custom Menus

9. Repeat Steps 5 through 8 to define the other submenus that will be
accessed by the other Function keys.
The calculator has eight Function keys, so you can have a maximum of
eight submenus in your Custom menu.
10. Press 2N to exit the Program editor.
Your Custom menu is automatically saved in the calculator under the
name you gave it in Step 2.
Creating a Custom menu on a PC
To create a Custom menu on a PC and then transfer it to your calculator,
follow these steps:
1. Start the appropriate TI-Graph Link software.
The TI-89, TI-92 Plus, and Voyage 200 are on speaking terms, so the
“appropriate” TI-Graph Link software can be for either the TI-89 or TI-92
Plus. The sidebar in this chapter tells you how to download this free
software from Texas Instrument’s Web site.
2. In the far-right panel, click in the Name text box and enter the name
of your Custom menu.
The name can consist of no more than eight characters, the first of
which must be a letter.
3. Click in the blank space between Prgm and EndPrgm.
4. Click the drop-down box in the left panel and select Control.
5. In the left column of this panel, click Special, and then in the right
column, double-click Custom . . . EndCustm to place this command in
your program.
With the exception of the first line, your program should look like the
third picture in Figure A-3.
Figure A-4:
Defining the
submenus
(Function
keys) in a
Custom

310
TI-89 Graphing Calculator For Dummies 

6. Enter the submenus for your Custom menu by following Steps 5
through 9 in the preceding section.
Remember, you’re working on a PC — so you can do all those keystrokes
directly on your computer. For example, I’m sure you know where the
space and quote keys are located on your computer keyboard. When
you’re finished, the end of your custom menu should look similar to the
third picture in Figure A-4.
7. To save your Custom menu, choose File➪Save. 
8. In the File Name text box, change UNTITLED to the name of your
Custom menu.
9. In the box to the right of the Save As panel, select the directory on
your PC where you want to save the Custom menu and then click OK.
Sorry folks, but you’re dealing with an ancient piece of software that rec-
ognizes only eight-character names for the directories. TI has updated
the TI-Graph Link software so that it works with current TI calculators,
but it hasn’t done the same for the PC. Why? I don’t know. Perhaps the
TI creators think their calculators are so good that no one would ever
need to program them!
10. Transfer your Custom menu to your calculator.
See Chapter 21 for details.
Installing and using a Custom menu
After storing your Custom menu in the calculator, you have to install it before
you can use it. To do this, follow these steps:
1. If you aren’t already on the Home screen, press ".
2. Press 2| to display the VAR-LINK screen and then repeatedly press
D to highlight your Custom menu, as illustrated in the first picture in
Figure A-5.
3. Press ¸ to place the Custom menu on the command line of the
Home screen and then press d to close the parentheses. 
If you’re wondering why the calculator inserts the parentheses, it’s
because your Custom menu is a calculator program, and programs
expect you to input information in the parentheses the same way
you, for example, place information in the parentheses when using
the calculator to evaluate an integral or to factor a polynomial.
4. Press ¸ to install your Custom menu, as illustrated in the second
picture in Figure A-5.
311
Appendix: Creating Custom Menus

To display your Custom menu, press 2". The third picture in Figure A-5
displays the Custom menu created in the third picture in Figure A-4. You
select items from your Custom menu the same way you select items from any
menu, as I explain in Chapter 1. To return to the Toolbar menu, shown in the
second picture in Figure A-5, press 2" again. This key combination tog-
gles between the Toolbar menu and your Custom menu.
To uninstall your Custom menu, first display the Toolbar menu on the Home
screen. Then press 2ƒª¸ to execute the Restore custom default
command in the Clean Up menu. Finally, press 2" to display the Toolbar
menu. The key combination of 2" on the TI-89 now toggles between the
Toolbar menu and the Default Custom menu, as illustrated in the first two 
pictures in Figure A-1, shown earlier. To use your Custom menu again, you
have to reinstall it. 
Editing a Custom menu
To edit your Custom menu, you must first display it on either a PC or the cal-
culator. Then you can edit it the same way you created it. Chapter 1 tells
you how to edit on a calculator, and editing on a PC is . . . well, I’m sure you
know how to do that.
 To display and edit your Custom menu on a calculator, press O and
select the Program Editor. Then press © to open an existing program
and press DDB to display the programs housed in your calculator’s
memory. Repeatedly press D to highlight your Custom menu and then
press ¸ twice to display it. As you edit your Custom menu, the cal-
culator automatically saves your changes to the menu.
 To display and edit your Custom menu on a PC, start the TI-Graph
Link software, choose File➪Open, locate your Custom menu on the PC,
and then click OK. After editing your Custom menu, transfer it to your
calculator.
If you edit a Custom menu that is already installed on your calculator, you
don’t have to reinstall it — the changes made to the menu should automati-
cally appear. If they don’t, toggle between the Toolbar menu and your Custom
menu to make them appear.

Creating Functions
Are you fed up with pressing many keys to perform the same calculator task
over and over again? Or are you disappointed that the calculator doesn’t
have a command that executes a mathematical formula you frequently use? If
so, you can create your own function or program that houses multiple key-
strokes in a single command — and then you can place that command in a
Custom menu so you have easy access to it. (You find out how to create that
Custom menu earlier in this chapter.) This section tells you how to create a
keystroke-saving function. To create a more elaborate program, consult the
manual that came with your calculator.
Are you wondering what the difference is between a function and a program?
Well, a program has multiple steps, as illustrated in the example in the first
picture in Figure A-6. A function does only one thing — it takes the informa-
tion you give it and spits out an answer, as illustrated in the second picture in
Figure A-6. Most of the menu items housed in the calculator are functions,
and none are programs. For example, the solve command is a function — you
give it an equation and a variable, and it spits out the solution for the variable.
If you’re adept at creating programs, you won’t have any trouble taking the
directions for creating a function and adapting them to creating a program.
The programming commands used by the calculator are housed in the
Control and I/O menus, which appear in the Toolbar, as illustrated in the
third picture in Figure A-6.
Creating a function on the calculator
To create a function on the calculator, follow these steps:
1. Press O and select the Program editor. Then press ª to tell the cal-
culator that you’re creating a new program or function.
2. Press B© to tell the calculator you’re creating a function.

Appendix: Creating Custom Menus

3. Press DD and enter the name of your function, as illustrated in the
first picture in Figure A-7.
A calculator endowed with a current operating system is in Alpha Lock
mode waiting for you to enter letters. The name you give your Custom
menu can consist of no more than eight letters or numbers, the first of
which must be a letter. I explain entering letters, numbers, and symbols
in Chapter 1.
If you get symbols when you try to enter letters, you need to upgrade
your operating system. Chapter 21 tells you how to do this, but you don’t
need to do it right now. Simply press 2É to put the calculator in
Alpha Lock mode and upgrade the operating system when convenient.
4. Press ¸ twice.
You see a screen similar to the second picture in Figure A-7 with the
cursor placed between the parentheses after the name of the function.
5. Enter the variables used in the formula.
The variables you enter are dummy variables — this means that the cal-
culator doesn’t care what you call them. For example, if one of the vari-
ables you enter is a and the calculator has a number stored in a, the
calculator ignores this and treats a as a variable (instead of equating a
to the value stored in it).
If your formula has more than one variable, these variables must be sep-
arated by commas, as shown on the first line of the third picture in
Figure A-7.
6. Press DD and enter the formula for your function, as illustrated in
the third picture in Figure A-7.
As an example, the third picture in Figure A-7 shows the formula for a
function designed to find the nth column of matrix a; the second picture
in Figure A-6 is that of a function which computes the angle between two
vectors, u and v. The commands in these formulas were entered by
using the menus on the calculator (2zy¨ for the transpose T of a
matrix) or the keypad (¥Ûfor cos–1 on the TI-89).
7. Press 2N to exit the Program editor.
Your function is automatically saved in the calculator under the name
you gave it in Step 3.

Creating a function on a PC
To create a function on your PC and then transfer it to your calculator, follow
these steps:
1. Start the appropriate TI-Graph Link software.
The TI-89, TI-92 Plus, and Voyage 200 are on speaking terms, so the
“appropriate” TI-Graph Link software can be for either the TI-89 or TI-92
Plus. The sidebar in this chapter tells you how to download this free
software from the Texas Instruments Web site.
2. In the far-right panel, click in the Name text box and enter the name
of your function.
The name can consist of no more than eight characters, the first of
which must be a letter.
3. Place the cursor between the parentheses on the first line in the right
screen.
4. Follow Steps 5 and 6 in the preceding section.
Ignore the fact that the ancient TI-Graph Link software doesn’t recognize
the difference between a function and a program — to any regeneration
of calculator or software, a function is a special form of a program. 
Keyboard strokes, such as those producing cos–1, can always be found
on the left screen by selecting Catalog from the drop-down box and then
clicking the appropriate letter.
Did the left screen of the TI-Graph Link software mysteriously disappear?
No problem, just click Window and then click Function List to make it
reappear.
5. To save your function, choose File➪Save. 
6. In the File Name text box, change UNTITLED to the name of your
Custom menu.
7. In the box on the right side of the Save As panel, select the directory on
your PC where you want to save the Custom menu and then click OK.
Unfortunately, you’re dealing with an ancient piece of software that rec-
ognizes only eight-character names for the directories. TI has updated
the TI-Graph Link software so that it works with current TI calculators,
but it hasn’t done the same for the PC.
8. Transfer your Custom menu to your calculator.
You find out how to do this in Chapter 21.

4. Click your flavor of PC: Windows, Macin-
tosh, or MS-DOS.
5. Click your flavor of calculator: TI-89 or TI-92
Plus. (Voyage 200 users, click TI-92 Plus.)
6. Log in. 
If you haven’t registered, do it now — it’s
free and well worth it.
7. Click your language of choice. (English is
the third selection.)
8. Click the software you selected. 
I know this is redundant, but do it anyway.
9. Follow the given directions. (Run installs the
software on your PC, and Save saves the
software so you can manually install it later.) 
After installing TI-Graph Link, you have to
restart your PC before you can use it. When you
have TI-Graph Link up and running, it works very
much like the calculator. On the left side of the
screen, you see the double-column Function
List menu and a drop-down box with Catalog as
the default entry. Click a letter in the left column,
and all the Catalog items beginning with that
letter appear in the right column. Click the down
arrow on the drop-down box to see the other
menus that appear on the calculator. When you
click one of these menus, its contents appear in
the right column.
On the right side of the screen, you see the
Program editor all set up and ready for you to
write your program. This side of the screen works
just as you would expect it to work, but with one
exception — to place a function in the right
column of the Function List in the Program editor,
position the cursor in the proper place in the
Program editor and then double-click the func-
tion in the Function List. After you’ve written your
program, you can transfer it to your calculator.
