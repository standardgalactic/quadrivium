Introduction
T

he average person spends roughly three seconds on a website before 
deciding whether to stay. That’s not enough time to read your latest blog 
post and know your blog is awesome. Instead, design impacts that decision. 
If the visitor does happen to stay, you want to keep them around with a blog 
that just plain makes sense to use.
This book seeks to help you improve your blog design, whether you’re starting 
from scratch, redesigning an existing blog, or simply tinkering with your current 
design. I cover blog design in ways you might expect — design principles, colors, 
and fonts — and in ways you might not know are actually part of design — 
navigation, usability, and shareability. This book breaks all that down in an 
approachable, easy-to-use format so you can design a blog that encourages 
readers to stick around.
About This Book
Think of this book as a design guide for the average (and awesome) blogger. 
Most bloggers don’t have experience with design or coding. You simply have 
a voice you want to share through your blog. Whether you design a blog 
yourself, hire someone, or purchase pre-made design elements, this book 
gives you to tools to understand what makes a blog successful from a design 
and navigation standpoint.
This book is geared towards bloggers of all skill levels, although if you’ve been 
blogging for a while you may already know some of these tips or techniques. 
But not so fast! You may have been blogging for a long time but never knew 
underlying design principles, basic color theory, or exactly how to do a 
particular technique I mention. That means everyone learns something from 
this book.
By the end of this book, you’ll know:
	
✓	What constitutes good blog design and why design matters in the first 
place
	
✓	How to ensure your blog design syncs with your blog goals, your audience, 
and your content
	
✓	Ways to customize your blog design, from headers to footers and every­
thing in between
	
✓	How to design your blog to be easy to navigate and use
	
✓	Ways to create design-friendly content to improve readability

Blog Design For Dummies 
You can work through this book page by page or completely out of order. 
You’ll find value either way. In typical For Dummies fashion, this book makes 
it easy to find what you’re looking for with clearly outlined parts, chapter 
intros that spell out what you’ll learn, and a detailed index to find your way 
to something specific.
Finally, this book isn’t meant to intimidate you when it comes to blog design. 
In fact, my goal is to empower you to take control of your blog design and 
feel confident about it. Even when your design is complete, use this book as 
your design guide when you need help with a specific piece of your design or 
just want to browse through examples of great blog design. 
Foolish Assumptions
Forgive me, but I’m about to make some assumptions about your blogging 
knowledge. I expect that if you picked up this book, you know some of the 
basics of blogging such as uploading a photo, publishing a blog post, and 
installing plug-ins. I assume that most bloggers who buy this book already 
have a blog, but if you don’t then you can still find value in this book. It just 
won’t cover the beginning steps of how to set up a blog and get things rolling. 
The majority of this book is not geared towards any specific blog platform; 
however, when I show you steps, they are typically for the WordPress.org 
platform because it’s the most popular one. The majority of plug-ins that I 
mention are also for WordPress, although some plug-ins can be used on mul­
tiple blog platforms. When possible, I mention options for Blogger, Tumblr, 
and a few other platforms, too. I also assume that you aren’t a developer 
or professional blog designer. I wrote this book to make good blog design 
achievable for the masses, so my advice won’t always be the most complex 
or require you to dig deep into your code. However, it will always be geared 
toward helping bloggers without a design or technical background achieve a 
blog design they can be proud to show their friends and fellow bloggers.
What I don’t assume is the type of blogger you are. The information in this 
book isn’t just for a parent blogger or a food blogger or any other type of 
blogger. I wrote this book with all bloggers in mind and with oodles of full-
color examples of great blogs on the Web. In fact, pay special attention to 
those blog designs outside your niche because you might discover cool ideas 
you don’t see within your own blogging circles.
Conventions Used in This Book
Throughout this book, I use a few basic conventions over and over to make 
the information I present easy to understand:

3
 Introduction
	
✓	If you see text in bold, you’re meant to type just as it appears in the 
book. A little exception though: when you work through a steps list, then 
each step is bold to make the steps easier to follow. In those cases, the 
text to type isn’t bold. 
	
✓	If you see text in italics, this means I’m introducing a word or phrase you 
might or might not know, then defining it. 
	
✓	Web addresses and code appear in monofont. If you’re reading a digital 
version of this book on a device connected to the Internet, note that you 
can click the web address to visit that website. Nice!
	
✓	When you need to select an option in a menu, I use a little arrow (➪) to 
let you know the path to take, such as Dashboard➪Appearance. 
Icons Used in This Book
This book features little icons like these to point out special points of interest:
	
The Tip icon marks tips (well, duh!) and extra ideas that you can use to make 
your blog design even better. Consider these the make-designing-your-blog-
easier icons.
	
When you see the Remember icon, store this information in the back of 
your mind for future use. This icon marks things I want to reinforce as super 
important.
	
Red alert! Red alert! This little gem marks important information that may 
alert you to design pitfalls or save you a headache or two. I don’t use this one 
often so pay special attention when I do.
	
Information tagged as Technical Stuff means extra geeky stuff that you can

Where to Go from Here
You don’t have to start this book by flipping the page to Chapter 1 and read­
ing chapter by chapter until you get to the Appendix. But, hey, you can if 
you want! Start anywhere your burning questions take you, whether you’re 
dying to know how to select colors or fonts (Chapter 6) or ways to make your 
content easy to find (Chapter 12). However, consider the first few chapters 
mandatory. They provide you a basic foundation not only in design, but in 
understanding your blog. These basics will undoubtedly lead to a stronger 
blog design.

logging introduces a way for people to have a platform for sharing their 
words with anyone in the world. Along with that opportunity comes the 
chance to build a blog design that complements your words and leaves a last­
ing impression. 
When you think of blog design, the first things that come to mind might be 
colors, fonts, or an overall blog layout. However, blog design goes deeper than 
that. In fact, this quote from Apple founder Steve Jobs pretty much sums it up: 
“Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.”
The main purpose of this book is to teach design to bloggers who aren’t 
designers. Few things about design are required because designing a blog is 
more like part art and part science. We all have different tastes and styles, 
but in the end, design should function to give a visitor a positive experience.
In this chapter, I introduce you to how good blog design benefits your blog. 
You also get a glimpse at how web users generally look at websites — and 
blogs in particular. Then I tackle foundations of good blog design so you 
can recognize good design and understand why it’s good. Additionally, this 
chapter introduces a few tools to help you start designing (or re-designing) 
your blog.

Part I: Getting Started with Blog Design 
Knowing Why Blog Design Matters
I’m sure this has happened to you: You’re hungry, so you search online for 
local restaurants and click a result that sounds interesting. The restaurant’s 
website has shockingly ugly colors, auto-playing music, and flashing graph­
ics. The menu is at the bottom of the last page you’d look for it and offers no 
descriptions, no prices, and no pictures. And even if you wanted to go to this 
restaurant at this point, the address is nowhere to be found. This restaurant 
may be the best one in town, but you just formed an impression of the food 
solely from its website.
Great blog design matters in the same way that restaurant’s website does. 
When your design looks polished and professional, and is straight-forward 
to use, readers automatically trust that you also have good content. Good 
design also implies that you’re committed not only to keeping your content 
fresh but committed to your readers as well.
So, does design matter more than content? Nope. If you had walked into that 
restaurant from the street, ate there, and loved it, you probably wouldn’t 
care what its website looks like because you know the “content” is solid. But 
without an appealing blog design, a reader may never take a minute to actu­
ally read your content. After all, if your design is bad, why would your con­
tent be any better?
	
Good blog design reinforces the idea that your content is awesome. The ins 
and outs of your design keep your new visitors exploring your content, help 
you meet your blog goals, and draw attention to your blog’s most important 
asset: your content.
Communicating with design
In the face-to-face world, facial expressions and body language often speak 
more than the words coming from someone’s mouth. Your blog’s design 
communicates in the same way, speaking even before your content does. The 
colors you use, the fonts you select, the images you showcase, and even the 
layout you choose all communicate something to the reader.
Design should reinforce the personality of your blog or help convey what 
your blog is about. A powerful image in your header can communicate emo­
tion or a single design element can give readers a clearer picture of your 
blog’s message. Even text can make a bold statement, serving as a graphical 
element to attract a reader’s eye.

9
 Chapter 1: Recognizing Components of a Well-Designed Blog
On my blog Momcomm (www.momcomm.com), I write about blogging and 
social media. I want my blog to be perceived as fun and approachable as well 
as communicate that this blog makes even complex topics easy to under­
stand. As you can see in Figure 1-1, my blog design features a smiley face in 
the header and a prominent Welcome! in the sidebar to make readers feel 
welcome. In addition, I use plenty of formatting in my blog posts to make 
them easy to follow.
Figure 1-1: My blog uses design to communicate my message of being approachable and 
welcoming.
In addition, the placement of certain blog elements within your design can 
communicate what you want a reader to do. For example, an e-mail subscrip­
tion’s prominent location at the top of the page communicates its importance.
In Chapter 3, I talk a lot about how to showcase your voice, determine your 
tone, and more to help build a strong, purposeful design.
Orienting users with navigation design
When people think about blog design, they usually think of colors, fonts, and 
images first. But design also includes navigation design, which is design cen­
tered around how visitors move through your blog.

10
Part I: Getting Started with Blog Design 
	
Your navigation design should always be focused around helping blog visitors 
find their way around your site in the simplest, most logical way possible. 
Part III of this book is entirely devoted to making your blog easy to navigate 
and to use.
However, navigation design can also mean offering your readers little (or 
big) surprises that go above and beyond the basics. For example, the blog 
From Away (www.fromaway.com) focuses on cooking and eating in Maine, 
with a page called Our Favorite Places in Portland (www.fromaway.com/
our-favorites) that covers Portland’s best breakfast sandwiches, pizzas, 
lobster rolls, and more.
In Figure 1-2, you can see 
the breakfast sandwich 
section, where a visitor 
can navigate to each 
restaurant’s website, 
see a map of those res­
taurants, and click a link 
to go to reviews of those 
sandwiches. Plus, each 
sandwich is clearly num­
bered and represented 
by a close-up image. The 
result is a useful tool 
that readers will return 
to when they want to eat 
in Portland. An image 
toward the bottom of 
their homepage calls 
attention to the page, 
and it’s also linked from 
their main navigation 
menu.
	
After you get the basics out of the way on your own blog’s navigation design, 
consider ways you can add bonuses like this to get readers deeper into your 
content or other useful content elsewhere.
Discovering How Readers 
Visually Travel Your Blog
Humans may be diverse and dynamic, but we typically surf through web 
pages in a similar way. Images, color, and fonts attract attention, serving as 
little marks on a road map that pull you through a website’s or blog’s design.

Figure 1-2: This blog gives visitors useful content with a 
friendly design.

 Chapter 1: Recognizing Components of a Well-Designed Blog
This section covers a couple of ways to recognize how blog visitors typically 
behave when they land on a blog.
Exploring how visitors click through websites
Just as humans are diverse, we’re also creatures of habit. We do things in 
similar ways and feel more comfortable when things are a certain way and in 
a certain order. Certain web and blog designs work because they follow the 
way most people work through websites.
Many studies show that visitors spend more time looking at the left side of 
a web page than the right. In fact, one study from Nielsen Norman Group 
(www.nngroup.com/articles/horizontal-attention-leans-left/) 
showed that web users spent 69 percent of their viewing time looking at the 
left half of a page — and because (in this Western culture) we read from left 
to right, this makes sense. Due to this convention, you probably notice that 
many blog designs have a header and navigation menu at the top, a main 
column of content on the left, and a sidebar on the right.
	
Many well-designed blogs use other layout types successfully (see Chapter 7 
for some examples) by using attention-grabbing design elements to pull read­
ers to other parts of the blog design.
In addition, website visitors spend about 80 percent of their time on the part 
of a web page that’s above the fold (what’s viewable on a page before the 
visitor has to scroll down), according to another study from Nielsen Norman 
Group (www.nngroup.com/articles/scrolling-and-attention/).
Although you can stick with conventions like these to help with your blog 
design, the web’s ever-changing nature means that conventions can change 
over time. The only sure-fire way to see how visitors behave on your own 
blog is to track mouse clicks. You can track mouse clicks using heat maps. 
A heat map is a visual representation of website traffic that uses color-spot 
intensity to show how readers click through a website.
For example, I tracked my blog’s clicks for a period of time to see what 
results I’d get. With a color spectrum where blue means fewer clicks and 
red means more clicks, I noticed that my About page tab on the top left of 
the page and my Twitter icon in my sidebar got the strongest amount of 
clicks (see Figure 1-3). In addition, some of my navigation tabs — Online 
Course & E-book, Page Critiques, and Find a Designer — were clicked more 
often than my Advertising and Contact tabs, as denoted by the green spots on 
those tabs. 

12
Part I: Getting Started with Blog Design 
Figure 1-3: This heat map shows that most visitors click my About page.
	
If you want to try out heat mapping to see how your blog design performs, 
you can try 
	
✓	Crazy Egg: www.crazyegg.com
	
✓	Clicky: www.clicky.com
	
✓	Mouseflow: http://mouseflow.com
	
✓	ClickTale: www.clicktale.com
All the preceding websites except Crazy Egg offer a limited, free plan as well 
as pay versions. With mouse tracking services like these, you can see exactly 
where visitors click, even when they click an area that isn’t clickable — 
meaning that you could discover people are clicking a design element that 
isn’t linking to anywhere but should be.
Recognizing that people are skimmers
Come on, admit it. You skim, too! Think about all the content out there to 
consume: blogs, news sites, social media sites, and so on. With so much to 
read, you can easily get overwhelmed. In fact, I know you won’t read this 
entire book word for word. But don’t worry — I’m not offended!
	
People skim through blogs because time is limited, they’re searching for 
something specific, or both. It doesn’t mean they don’t like your content 
(although they may skim to get a feel for your blog). It does mean, though, 
that you have to account for the fact people skim when you work on your 
blog design.

13
 Chapter 1: Recognizing Components of a Well-Designed Blog
The goal in designing with skimmers in mind isn’t necessarily to make people 
change their skimming ways but rather to account for the fact that some 
people just have time to skim and to also acknowledge that others you may 
convince to stop and take action.
In your actual blog post, consider adding subheadings that stand out from 
your main text. For visitors who are skimming, subheadings give them your 
key points. If something catches their eye, they might stop to read your 
entire post.
In your sidebar, think about using a pop of color on your e-mail signup form 
that gets the reader to stop and take action. Purposeful design like this might 
entice a visitor to stop and sign up for your newsletter.
Using Design Elements That 
Complement Your Message
You started your blog for a reason. Maybe you have funny stories about life 
to tell or helpful tips to share. Maybe you have a passion for inspiring others 
or encouraging people to do something. Every blogger has a message to 
share. Good blog design reinforces that message.
Communicating your brand through design
Good branding is the reason you know you get an amazing quality if you buy 
your favorite name-brand product. Branding is also the reason you first think 
safety or luxury when someone says a car manufacturer’s name, rather than 
just thinking car manufacturer.
Even if you never really thought about what your brand is, you still have one. 
Your brand is how people perceive your blog. Blogs with strong brands make 
emotional connections with their readers and are consistent both in their 
design and their voice, even if they blog about many different topics.
Your blog readers probably don’t think that much about the ins and outs of 
your blog’s brand, but branding works for that very reason. Good branding 
makes you devoted to a product, an evangelist for a service, or a fan of a blog, 
mostly for reasons people don’t think too hard about. It’s that emotional 
connection and that consistency that keeps them coming back.

14
Part I: Getting Started with Blog Design 
If you’re unsure just what your brand is or should be, just ask yourself this: 
What do I want my blog to be known for? Then list a few things that come to 
mind. Your design should support the things you jot down.
Colors, fonts, and images are obvious ways to infuse a brand into your blog 
design, but branding extends into the way you format your posts, too. For 
example, if you write quick-witted, punchy blog posts, your paragraphs 
should be short and punchy as well.
To what extent you (yes, you!) become part of your blog’s brand depends on 
your blog’s goals. For example, Brittany Van der Linden’s lifestyle blog That’s 
Vandy (www.thatsvandy.com), shown in Figure 1-4, is a play off her last 
name. Because her blog is about making life awesome “the Vandy way,” her 
blog’s header design signifies her as part of the brand. A pink circle around 
her headshot makes the connection that Vandy relates to her, while the bold 
blue tagline unmistakably lets readers know what to expect from her blog. 
© That’s Vandy, www.thatsvandy.com
Figure 1-4: This blog brand uses an image of the author in the header.
Acknowledging the importance of images
The usage of imagery can make or break any blog design. Great images com­
mand attention, and poor quality images lessen an image’s ability to make 
a positive impression. In fact, images are so crucial to a blog’s design that I 
devote all of Chapter 15 to using images in your blog. When using images for 
your blog design, use those that help tell your story or support your blog’s 
message. 
The header design from the Pile O’ Fabric (www.pileofabric.com) blog 
rotates close-up images of fabric (see Figure 1-5). These colorful images make 
a vibrant impact to reinforce what the blog is about.

15
 Chapter 1: Recognizing Components of a Well-Designed Blog

Figure 1-5: Pile O’ Fabric rotates a few bright and colorful images in the blog header.
Applying enough formatting
Formatting often gets overlooked when it comes to blog design. I mean, 
colors and fonts are way more fun, right? But formatting your content in a 
way that’s easily readable can be the difference between someone actually 
reading or sharing your blog post or page and someone just hitting their 
browser’s back button, never to return.
	
Even if you aren’t a designer, keep in mind that even text should be visually 
appealing. If you’re writing a tutorial to make something easy to understand, 
your tutorial layout should be easy to follow with clearly marked steps and 
possibly images to support certain steps.
Think about it. What’s easier to read: long paragraphs that say “First you do 
this. Next you do this.” Or a numbered list of steps? Of course, the clear list 
of steps is a better way because that makes each step distinct and easy to 
follow along. Otherwise, your readers may get lost in the instructions.
In Chapter 16, I get into ways that you can make your content easy to digest, 
from using lists to including subheadings.

Part I: Getting Started with Blog Design 
Creating a Great-Looking Blog 
(When You Aren’t a Designer)
Good designers don’t slap a design together. They think critically about each 
element that goes into the complete design, from the overall layout down to 
the colors.
This book isn’t meant to make you a full-fledged blog design expert, but you 
don’t have to be a design expert to whip up a nice-looking blog. Sure, you might 
want to know how to do this and that. The more you learn, though, the more you 
can add to your blog design over time, whether you’re enhancing the design 
or the functionality. These next sections cover a few key tips that I want to 
stick into your mind like superglue as you go through the rest of this book.
Striving for simplicity
What’s the sure sign of amateur designers? Overkill. Too many colors, too many 
fonts, too many different-sized thingamabobbers. Confident designers know 
that a blog design with minimal design elements can make a big statement.
	
As you work through your blog design, do a few self-checks periodically to 
ensure your design isn’t becoming too busy.
The blog In Jennie’s Kitchen (www.injennieskitchen.com) presents a 
perfect example of a simple, clean, and effective blog design (see Figure 1-6). 
The blog header uses only a warm, neutral color with a small blue line under 
her blog name. The small blog header size allows more of the photo from the 
most recent blog post to show, drawing your attention down into the content.
Building a blog that’s intuitive
When you turn a doorknob, you instinctively know to turn it to the right. 
Because of this, you might be a little confused if you tried to open a door 
with a doorknob that turned to the left. Intuitive design means that your blog 
works in a way that most people expect it to, much like that doorknob.
For example, if a piece of text within a blog post is underlined, then most 
readers would try to click that text, expecting that it was a hyperlink that 
takes you to another page. A visitor looking to search for content on a blog 
looks for a search field, not a link or button that leads to a separate page to 
begin a search — or worse yet, they find no search box at all.

Figure 1-6: A small header size gives more prominence to blog post images.
	
An intuitive blog design works so that visitors don’t need an instruction 
manual to get around the blog and find content that interests them. Part of 
achieving this means designing with website conventions in mind, like when 
to use underlined text, which signifies a link. The other part of ensuring an 
intuitive design revolves around putting items visitors need within easy 
reach so they don’t have to dig too far, like a search box or a drop-down list 
of your categories.
Of course, you can’t ensure that every single person never has any problems 
navigating through your blog. However, you can find out a lot about your 
specific blog visitors through your blog analytics. Use Chapter 5 for help with 
understanding how your blog analytics can help improve your design.
Keeping design balanced
Is your blog header really “heavy” with design elements or text on one side 
but sparse on the other? Balance helps tie elements together so the design 
is more evenly weighted. The two types of balance are symmetrical and 
asymmetrical:
	
✓	Symmetrical balance: Symmetry in design happens when a design is 
nearly the same on both sides of a central point. I say “nearly” because 
sometimes the symmetry is exact, and other times it’s not. If you were to 

18
Part I: Getting Started with Blog Design 
take a circle and fold it in half, each side is exactly the same. However, 
I might have a design with a square on one side of a center line and a 
circle on the other side. That’s still symmetry. Symmetry in design can 
provide a sense of stability, harmony, and order.
	
✓	Asymmetrical balance: Asymmetry just means the absence of symmetry. 
An asymmetrical design might have three design elements on one side 
and a large block of text on the other. Asymmetrical design creates inter­
est and provides contrast. However, you don’t want a lopsided design, 
with several design elements on one side of your blog header and none 
on the other side.
You see asymmetrical blog designs 
more often than symmetrical, 
but both work when done well. 
In Figure 1-7, these two header 
layouts show how balance can 
work in design. The layout on the top 
creates balance with a symmetrical 
design. On the bottom, the layout 
shifts the diamond to the left but 
provides balance with a large block 
of text beside the diamond.
Staying away from clutter
Think about that section of your house where papers, bills, and other things 
pile up. (I know you have one.) Wouldn’t it be easier to find that water bill if 
you had only 4 things sitting there and not 20?
One goal of good blog design is to draw attention to important parts of your 
blog, whether you want readers to notice an e-mail signup box or just your 
actual blog post. Think of clutter as attention’s arch-nemesis. Too much clut­
ter scatters your reader’s attention all over the place; so, not only can that 
reader not home in on something, but he also has a harder time finding some­
thing he is looking for. And because most blog readers are skimmers, there’s 
only so much attention to go around.
When tweaking your blog design, you might find yourself adding “things” — 
especially to those sidebars. An affiliate banner ad there, a cool widget down 
there, a link to your most popular post over there, and so on. Next thing you 
know, your sidebar is stuffed with, well, stuff.
Sidebars are the main offenders, but clutter can be anywhere — in your 
blog header, your footer, or anywhere else you might want to add elements. 
This kind of clutter comes in the form of jumbling together too many design 
elements. For example, the individual design elements that make up a blog 
header might be well designed, but together they present no clear focus to 
make those elements work together.
Figure 1-7: Examples of balanced symmetrical 
and asymmetrical design.

19
 Chapter 1: Recognizing Components of a Well-Designed Blog
	
The solution? Be ruthless in limiting what to add to your blog design. Good 
designers know that each element needs a purpose. You need a filter for what 
to include and what to remove. To help you filter, ask yourself these ques­
tions before adding new things to your blog design:
	
✓	Does this design element solve a problem, like add balance to your 
design?
	
✓	Are you adding a design element just to fill up space?
	
✓	Does your overall design maintain a focal point when you add a new 
design element?
If you’re considering adding a functional element to your blog design, such as 
a special button or grouping of links, consider these questions:
	
✓	How does this element fit into the purpose of my blog?
	
✓	Does this element support one of my blog goals?
	
✓	Is there a more effective place for this?
When you become deliberate in your design, you see that not everything 
deserves a spot in your blog design. Your design will be stronger for it!
	
In Chapter 11, I dive more into ways to steer clear of sidebar clutter.
Looking at Available Tools
When you work on your blog design, you’ll find a few tools are helpful from 
the start. Okay, so you can’t really start a blog design without a blogging plat­
form and an image editor. Those two are mandatory! Themes, templates, wid­
gets, and plug-ins make your path to a rocking blog design that much easier. I 
introduce them all in the following sections.
Selecting a blogging platform
If you already have a blog set up, you can go ahead and skip over this section. 
If you’re starting from scratch, though, you need to choose a blog platform 
before you can start working on your blog design.
Choosing a blog platform isn’t an easy decision because blog platforms 
come in many different flavors. I include a list of the most commonly used 
platforms in Table 1-1 to get you started. The main difference to consider is 
whether you want a blog that’s hosted or self-hosted:

20
Part I: Getting Started with Blog Design 
	
✓	Hosted means that the blog software and your content live on the blog 
platform’s own web servers. Hosted blog platforms take the responsibil­
ity of managing the software, data, and web-hosting so you don’t have 
to. Many bloggers start off with a hosted platform and eventually switch 
to a self-hosted platform to have more control over their blog design. 
However, many bloggers are completely happy sticking with hosted plat­
forms. The most popular hosted blog platform is Blogger.
	
✓	Self-hosted means that you install the blogging software on your own 
web server. You can pay for server space through a hosting company 
like Hostgator or Dreamhost. You have more control over your blog 
(and blog design) with a self-hosted site, but you also have more main­
tenance and responsibility over your blog when something goes wrong. 
The most popular self-hosting blog platform is WordPress.org.
Many bloggers start out with hosted blog software because it is generally 
(but not always) free, whereas self-hosted blogs may mean you must pay 
for web hosting, domain names, and other Internet services. In Table 1-1, I 
include costs for the software, but not for hosting and other services, which 
will vary depending on which providers and services you choose.

 Chapter 1: Recognizing Components of a Well-Designed Blog
	
The majority of this book offers advice and tips for blog design regardless of 
the platform. However, I often talk about plug-ins that work only for 
WordPress.org, because it’s the most flexible platform for customizing and 
designing your blog.
Finding an image-editing program
To design your blog, you need at least one tool that lets you create design 
elements to place into your blogging platform. With an image-editing pro­
gram, you can create a blog header, design elements for your sidebar, and 
edit images for your blog.
Many bloggers use photo-editing programs, such as the following:
	
✓	PicMonkey: Free. www.picmonkey.com
	
✓	Photoshop: Subscription fee. www.adobe.com/products/
photoshop.html
	
✓	Photoshop Elements: $99.99. www.adobe.com/products/
photoshop-elements.html
Some programs, like PicMonkey, you can use straight from the web and don’t 
need to install any additional software. Other programs, like Photoshop, need 
to be purchased or subscribed to and then downloaded onto your computer. 
In Chapter 15, I share these and many other options to suit a range of needs. 
Using themes and templates
Regardless of your platform, themes and templates are a great place to start 
building your blog design. Themes and templates both provide a design frame­
work to display the content of your blog. The terms theme and template are 
sometimes used interchangeably, but themes are typically more robust, includ­
ing functionality that improves your ability to customize the theme more easily.
Hosted blog platforms have their own templates to choose from. For some 
hosted platforms like Tumblr, you can use one of its designs or use one cre­
ated by someone else.
Because WordPress.org has the most design options, I cover the platform’s 
blog themes options in more detail in Chapter 7. I also give you some web­
sites to find WordPress.org themes as well as Blogger templates.
Exploring the importance of widgets and plug-ins
When it comes to blog design, you can add a lot of features to your blog 
without really coding anything. Each blogging platform varies in the ability to 
customize the design and functionality of your blog.

Part I: Getting Started with Blog Design 
Widgets are little applications that you can install to run within your blog. 
WordPress comes with many built-in widgets to do things like display your 
recent posts, a search form, or a drop-down of categories. (Blogger calls 
widgets “gadgets.”) Widgets are limited mainly to displaying things in your 
header, sidebar, or footer.
Some widgets and gadgets are built into the platform, and some widgets can 
be used in all types of platforms. In Chapter 11, I cover some social media 
widgets (such as a Facebook Like box) that work anywhere you can add 
HTML code.
Plug-ins are pieces of software that give additional functionality to a larger 
software application like WordPress. Widgets are a type of plug-in, but plug-
ins can do things beyond what widgets can do. Plug-ins can give your blog 
a commenting platform, a way for readers to share blog posts, or an entire 
e-commerce store. The plug-ins discussed in this book are for WordPress.org; 
however, some of them can be used for other blogging platforms.

Applying Core Design Principles
In This Chapter
▶	Defining four pillars of good design: proximity, repetition, contrast, and alignment
▶	Exploring ways to apply these pillars to your own blog design
J

ust like art, blog design is subjective. My taste may not be your taste and 
vice versa. And that’s okay. The world would be quite boring if everyone 
had the same tastes. Despite our own personal tastes, good design applies 
overarching design principles to make someone’s blog pleasing to the eye 
and easy to navigate.
As part of human nature, your readers make split-second judgments based on 
looks alone. That means your blog design speaks before your words ever do. 
Then when someone goes deeper and actually starts navigating your blog, 
truer opinions start forming around your overall blog design.
In this chapter, I cover four foundational design principles that leave a lasting 
impression: proximity, repetition, contrast, and alignment. These design prin­
ciples originally related to print design, but as the digital world has evolved, 
they work just the same for web design.
Regardless of whether you design your blog yourself or hire someone to 
design it for you, recognizing the key design principles will make you realize 
why you like certain blog designs and not others. The designs you like prob­
ably follow these principles. Throughout the chapter, you see how proximity, 
repetition, contrast, and alignment work to make a great blog design.
Providing Structure with Proximity
The principle of proximity in design refers to the way you place design ele­
ments in relation to one another. You can apply this principle to your blog 
design to emphasize relationships between certain elements and thus affect 
the overall user experience by providing structure.

24
Part I: Getting Started with Blog Design 
	
When considering how to use proximity, think of your entire blog design as 
well as specific parts of your design.
Thinking of your blog design as a whole, placing certain elements in close 
proximity to your header suggests that they warrant attention. When you 
visit a blog, you notice the header first because it’s at the top of the page 
and usually the largest visual element on the page. With that in mind, if you 
have your social media buttons at the top of a sidebar or within your header, 
you’re subtly telling the reader, “Hey! These social media buttons are impor­
tant!” When buttons are placed near or within your header, they become one 
of first things a new blog visitor sees on your blog, like these social media 
icons in Figure 2-1 at the top of the blog Tidy Mom (www.tidymom.net). 
Newspapers use proximity in this same way, placing major headlines and 
teasers leading to other important content above the fold.

Figure 2-1: Social media buttons appear at the top of the sidebar so visitors 
find them easily.
When it comes to various blog elements, applying the principle of proximity 
means placing similar or related elements near one another while ensuring 
that unrelated elements live somewhere else on a page. You can best imple­
ment this by grouping related content and by effectively using white space.
Grouping related content
For your blog layout to feel comfortable for your reader, using proximity 
can save the day. Plus, placing related content or design elements near one 
another allows your blog visitor to get to the important sections of your site 
quickly and efficiently. Think about the inside of your car. Sure would be 
harder to use your stereo if the controls weren’t all together. And the same 
thing goes with blog design. When items are grouped logically, your overall 
blog design just makes more sense.
For example, by organizing your navigation design with proximity in mind, 
you create associations in the visitor’s mind that make it easier to explore 
your blog.

25
 Chapter 2: Applying Core Design Principles
Some parts of your navigation logically fit together, such as
	
✓	Social media buttons (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest)
	
✓	Subscription methods (RSS, e-mail)
	
✓	Ways to find content (search box, categories, popular posts)
On Dear Crissy’s blog (www.dearcrissy.com), Crissy groups her search 
box, recent blog posts, categories, and archives together on her sidebar, as 
shown in Figure 2-2.
In addition, creating proximity in 
navigation can be something as 
simple as placing similar blog pages 
together in your navigation menu. If 
you have a food blog, for example, 
having a Recipes tab and Favorite 
Cooking Tools tab placed beside 
each other makes more sense than 
if you put a Contact page between 
them.
Applying the principle of proximity 
also suggests relationships between 
items grouped together. As an 
example, grouping a blog name and 
tagline together emphasizes the rela­
tionship between the two. This espe­
cially comes in handy if your tagline 
doesn’t make as much sense without 
the context of your blog name. As 
an example, if your blog name was 
A Slice of Life and the tagline was 
“Taking bites of the good stuff,” then 
the tagline becomes more effective 
placed close to the blog name. I cover 
taglines in more depth in Chapter 8.
However, you can’t adequately 
create groups of design elements or 
content without a designer’s best 
friend: white space.
Defining white space
White space refers to absence of text or graphics within a design. Contrary 
to how it sounds, white space isn’t necessarily white, though. White space

Figure 2-2: Group options to find blog content.

26
Part I: Getting Started with Blog Design 
not only provides balance to your blog design, but it also becomes critical to 
implementing the principle of proximity.
	
The proper use of white space can also shape your blog design in other dif­
ferent ways. For example, white space makes text on your blog more legible. 
Design elements surrounded by white space reinforce those elements’ prox­
imity to one another, attracting attention to that part of your blog. And white 
space can also guide the readers’ eyes in a certain direction, like to focus on 
an area you want to highlight. Large areas of white space can even communi­
cate an air of sophistication and openness.
In Figure 2-3, the white space on the right side of Lee La La’s header 
(http://leelala.net) allows you to notice the dandelion seeds floating 
down. Their path leads your eyes to the social media buttons. If that white 
space were filled with graphics, your eyes wouldn’t have been led down to 
the buttons as smoothly because other graphics would interrupt that flow.
© Lindsay Roberts, leelala.net
Figure 2-3: White space guides a reader’s eyes along a path.
	
Using white space in blog design often intimidates beginning designers, so 
they make the mistake of covering an entire image with design elements or 
spreading design elements out just to fill up the space. Instead, give graphics 
and words room to breathe and resist the urge to fill up every virtual nook 
and cranny.
	
When designing elements of your 
blog, be careful not to trap white 
space. Trapped white space refers 
to the space awkwardly boxed in 
between two or more design ele­
ments. Figure 2-4 illustrates how 
white space can get trapped within 
a blog header design. Trapped white 
space hinders the flow of design. 
Figure 2-4: Trapped white space to the left of 
the tagline.

27
 Chapter 2: Applying Core Design Principles
The best fix is to adjust the other design elements in a way that eliminates 
bounded white space.
Using Repetition
Humans expect repetition. You see repetition in nature, such as a giraffe’s 
spots or a flower’s petals. You also see repetition in the man-made pieces of 
the world: Think of street sign shapes or windows on a high-rise building.
In design, repetition means using the same or similar elements throughout 
your design. If you were to spread out all the elements of your blog design 
onto a (virtual) table, you want all those pieces to look like they’re parts of a 
greater whole.
Repetition enhances flow of your blog design by connecting different design 
elements to one another. In Figure 2-5, you can see how the blog Running 
with Penguins (http://runningwithpenguins.com) uses repetition. The 
penguins and clouds are repeated within the header. Also using the penguin 
in the sidebar keeps the reader moving through the blog design.
© Dean Schuster
Figure 2-5: Repetition creates a unified look in a blog’s design.

28
Part I: Getting Started with Blog Design 
These are elements of your blog design where you can apply repetition:
	
✓	Fonts
	
✓	Color schemes
	
✓	Images or icons
	
✓	Font size, colors, or images
	
✓	Blog post and sidebar headings
	
✓	Blog page layout structure
Creating consistency
Just like consistency is important in branding, consistency also plays an 
important role in blog design. Could you imagine if every single blog post 
looked like they were from different blogs? Or if your blog sidebar looked like 
it came from a completely different site than your header?
Repeating some of your design elements consistently through your blog not 
only eliminates confusion, but the repetition also creates continuity and 
rhythm in your blog design.
As shown in Figure 2-6, Money Saving Mom (http://moneysavingmom.
com) illustrates consistency by repeating the script font from the header 
throughout the graphical elements in the sidebar on the right.

Figure 2-6: Repeating a font through a blog creates a consistent blog design.

29
 Chapter 2: Applying Core Design Principles
Using repetition without being boring
Although repetition contributes to a strong blog design, using too much rep­
etition can lead to a boring and stale look. Thinking back to a giraffe’s spots, 
each spot on a giraffe isn’t exactly the same. They vary in size and shape, 
making the animal even more beautiful.
One of my favorite blog designs is from Simply Vintagegirl (www.simply
vintagegirl.com/blog). In Figure 2-7, you can see three distinct parts of 
Simply Vintagegirl’s overall design unified by repetition. Emily Rose uses the 
bird image from her blog header in the sidebar and to the left of each blog 
post title. However, she varies the bird in each instance by applying color, 
changing the size and adjusting the orientation.
© Emily Rose Brookshire, SimplyVintagegirl.com
Figure 2-7: Repetitive design elements don’t have to look exactly the same.
Repetition can also suggest that items are related to one another. In my 
blog’s social media buttons shown earlier in Figure 2-1, they all are blue 
circles, even though what’s in the center signifies the social media platform 
they link to.
	
When you vary repeated elements in your blog design, make the variation 
subtle. That way, your design still looks unified. The birds from Simply 
Vintagegirl’s blog wouldn’t connect her blog together the same way if all the 
birds were completely different.

Part I: Getting Started with Blog Design 
Creating Contrast
Contrast in blog design occurs when two or more elements are different from 
one another. The more difference between the elements, the greater the con­
trast. Your blog design can benefit from contrast in a few ways:
	
✓	Contrast can provide visual interest. Our eyes are drawn to contrasting 
things, such as a pale moon against a black sky or a tall building sur­
rounded by others a fraction of its size. In blog design, contrast can keep 
a blog pleasing to look at instead of being bland and uninteresting.
	
✓	Contrast can make an element jump off the page and encourage the 
reader to take action. If you want to highlight a button that links to your 
new e-book, you can use contrast so the button stands out while still fit­
ting into your overall design. 
	
	Pat Flynn’s blog Smart Passive Income (www.smartpassiveincome.
com) uses light green boxes with a dark green border to make important 
areas of his blog design stand out. In Figure 2-8, the “Don’t know where 
to start?” and eBook Guide boxes contrast with the black video and 
e-book image to make those elements pop off the page and drive interest 
in his blog.
© Smart Passive Income
Figure 2-8: Using different colors can help you achieve good contrast in your design.

31
 Chapter 2: Applying Core Design Principles
	
✓	Contrast makes text easy to read. Have you ever been to a blog where 
you couldn’t read an actual blog post because the background color 
and text color were too similar? Yeah, me too. Contrast needs to exist 
for blog post readability to entice your visitors to actually stay and read 
your posts. A white background with black or dark gray text is always a 
safe choice for main areas of content like a blog post. 
Exploring methods to create contrast
You can apply contrast to your blog 
design in a few ways. Here are some 
common ones, which you can see in 
Figure 2-9:
	
✓	Color: Probably the most 
common way to apply contrast 
is through color. You can use 
contrasting colors of the same 
shade (such as black with a 
light gray) or two colors on 
opposite ends of the color 
wheel (orange and blue). You 
can even use a single color to 
make a certain blog element 
stand out, such as how the 
red Free Instant Access button 
stands out against a pale green 
background in Figure 2-8. (Read 
more about color in Chapter 6.)
	
✓	Fonts: Using two different fonts that complement each other can also 
create contrast in your text. For example, pairing a script font with a sans-
serif font provides visual interest. (See more about fonts in Chapter 6.)
	
	You can also apply contrast with the same font by applying bold and 
italics. Just use either in moderation. Also, avoid underlining text 
because most online visitors would assume that an underlined word is a 
hyperlink.
	
✓	Size: Having two or more design elements of different sizes also creates 
contrast. For example, most all blog designs use a blog post title that’s 
larger than the subheadings within the post’s content.
	
✓	Images within your blog content: Adding images to your blog content 
provides contrast by breaking up large passages of text and drawing the 
reader further down into your blog.
After you understand these ways to apply contrast, you can start combining 
them to add even greater contrast, such as using two different fonts with two 
different colors.
Figure 2-9: Four ways to provide contrast.

32
Part I: Getting Started with Blog Design 
Applying the right amount of contrast
Contrast in blog design can be tricky. More contrast doesn’t always equal 
better contrast. And sometimes you might not want to apply enough contrast 
for fear of taking it too far.
Too much contrast can be jarring to the reader or hinder your blog’s read­
ability. For example, using white text on a black background is a frequently 
cited example of too much contrast. Although it may work in small doses, 
reading paragraph after paragraph becomes tiring because your eyes have to 
work harder to read the text. It also 
produces halation, the tendency of 
white characters or text to “glow” 
when on a black background.
Although not necessarily jarring, too 
little contrast can also make your blog 
hard to read. For example, creating 
subheadings in your blog post by 
just bolding text may not make the 
subheadings stand out enough for 
someone skimming your blog post. 
(Most people skim.) In this example, 
using a different font and a different 
color (as shown in Figure 2-10) adds 
enough contrast for the way people 
will likely interact with your blog’s 
content.
	
When you’re deciding how elements should contrast, keep in mind the following 
questions:
	
✓	What are the most important and second most important actions you 
want blog visitors to take? Add contrast to highlight the areas of your 
blog where readers will take those actions (such as the Free Instant 
Access button example mentioned earlier). 
	
✓	How can contrast make this content easily accessible to blog visitors? 
Sometimes, breaking up text with photos is ideal. For example, a how-to 
post full of photos that show the steps is the most efficient and easy-
to-skim way to present that information and break up the text. If your 
content is more conceptual than visual, breaking text into subheadings 
as shown in Figure 2-10 may be a better choice.
Figure 2-10: Using a different font and color for 
blog post subheadings.

 Chapter 2: Applying Core Design Principles
Aligning Design Elements
Alignment refers to lining up elements or text within a design. Even if you’ve 
never designed anything before, you’ve used alignment in a word processing 
program when selecting left, center, right, or justified alignment for your 
paragraphs.
Proper alignment makes various design elements or text appear as if they 
were connected through a visible line. I’d say that alignment is the most 
subtle of the core design principles, mainly because unless you’re aware of 
this design principle, you may not be able to pinpoint why a design looks 
“off.” Despite the subtlety, alignment is a key principle of blog design, 
because alignment gives a blog 
design a clean and polished look.
You can align design elements both 
on a vertical or horizontal axis. 
	
✓	On a vertical axis, you could 
align left, center, or right. 
Aligning a blog post’s text is an 
example of vertical alignment.
	
✓	On a horizontal axis, you 
align design elements to 
the top, center or baseline. 
Figure 2-11 illustrates ways 
to align differently shaped 
rectangles. Despite the type 
of alignment, the rectangles 
look as if they were connected 
by a visible line, which I’ve 
added for you as a dashed line.
Creating order through alignment
Aligning various elements on your blog or within a design element gives your 
design order and improves readability.
When talking about alignment as it relates to blog design, here are some 
common elements where you can apply alignment:
	
✓	Components of the blog header
	
✓	Sidebar buttons or badges
	
✓	Text within your post or sidebar
	
✓	Images within your post or sidebar
Figure 2-11: Examples of top, center, and 
baseline alignment on a horizontal axis.

34
Part I: Getting Started with Blog Design 
You can also take a more bird’s-eye 
view of your blog design and look at 
how separate blog elements align 
to one another. For example, in 
Figure 2-12, I added a dashed line 
so that you can see how the blog 
name, tagline, blog post title, and 
post content all align to the left.
Using grids or lines to 
aid in placement
If you’re designing your own blog, 
you’re most likely using a theme or 
framework that already takes align­
ment into consideration. However, 
if you’re designing your blog header 
or other components that make up 
your overall blog design, grids or 
lines can help ensure that parts of your design line up.
Using a grid system provides you with a guide so your design elements 
don’t look like they were haphazardly placed here and there. Some design 
programs like Adobe Illustrator or Photoshop have settings to show grids 
and the capability to add guiding lines. In Adobe Photoshop, design with a 
grid by choosing View➪Show➪Grid. In Photoshop Elements 11, you choose 
View➪Grid.
	
When it comes to aligning text within your actual blog posts, you don’t have 
to worry too much. Blogging platforms such as WordPress default to aligning 
your text to the left, but you can change this by simply clicking the icons that 
adjust your alignment to the right, center, or full (justified).

of a home page.

Getting to Know Your Blog 
(Even Better)
In This Chapter
▶	Understanding how goals affect blog design
▶	Pinpoint your voice and tone
▶	Exploring ways to get to know your audience
B

efore you embark on designing your blog, you and your blog need to sit 
down and have a little chat. Get to know one another. Maybe even have 
some coffee together.
Kidding aside, to design a blog that reflects who you are and what you blog 
about, you need to take a closer look at your blog. I assume that you’ve 
already defined your purpose for blogging. If you still scratch your head over 
that, start there and determine what made you start a blog in the first place. 
As Darren Rowse from the popular blog Problogger once said: “If you’re fuzzy 
on what your blog is about, it’s unlikely that anyone else will have much of an 
idea either.”
This chapter goes beyond your blog’s purpose. I help you go deeper by 
giving you some ways to take a closer look at your blog. That way, you really, 
truly understand it. In this chapter, I show you how to create goals, get to 
know your audience, and even hone in on the voice and tone you want to 
shine through in your blog design.
Creating Goals for a Strong Design
If you’re serious about growing your blog and creating a strong design, move 
setting goals to the top of your blog design to-do list. Think of them as the 
skeleton of your blog. From design to navigation to content, every decision 
you make about your blog should move you toward putting meat on that 
skeleton’s bones.

36
Part I: Getting Started with Blog Design 
Without goals, you might find yourself veering off track with your blog 
design. Sure, your design may look nice, but it might not mesh with what 
you want to accomplish in your blogging. And if you weren’t blogging to 
accomplish something, you probably wouldn’t have invested in this book to 
improve your blog design.
Pinpointing what you want to accomplish
If the thought of setting goals makes your mind go blank, try one of the easiest, 
most common ways to set goals: the SMART method. SMART is a mnemonic 
device that has been used in project management for decades. The letters 
in SMART can stand for different things, depending on who you talk to, but 
here’s what I stick with:
	
✓	Specific: Say exactly what you’re looking to achieve. Generic goals may 
be easy to think up, but they don’t move you toward an achievable goal 
in the same way specific goals do. “I want to make money blogging” isn’t 
specific enough. “I want to earn $500 a month through advertising” is 
specific.
	
✓	Measurable: Quantify your goal with numbers. Say you gained 500 e-mail 
subscribers last year. That’s less than 50 per month. So, shoot for 75 
new subscribers a month. Or 100. Just try not to fall into the trap about 
obsessing about numbers.
	
	Other measurables you can strive for could be publishing three times 
per week, increasing subscribers by 30 percent, or earning a certain 
amount of money from blogging.
	
✓	Actionable: When setting goals, stick with action words. Even better? 
Imperative verbs. Start your goals with words like increase, create, and 
grow. All these cut to the chase, driving action on your part.
	
✓	Realistic: Being realistic means setting goals that are challenging but 
doable. Also avoid claiming that you want to be the best, funniest, and 
so on. I’m not saying you can’t ever be the best, but there are plenty of 
steps you’ll need to take to get there — so make those your goals.
	
	Try not to make your goals too difficult or too easy. If you aren’t sure 
whether your goal is realistic, you can always adjust it later.
	
✓	Timely: I don’t know about you, but my inner procrastinator doesn’t work 
without a timeframe to complete something. Why? There’s no urgency to 
light my fire. Add timeframes to your goals to keep that fire lit.

37
 Chapter 3: Getting to Know Your Blog (Even Better)
To start writing out your goals, think about your blog’s bigger purpose as 
well as more specific things you want to accomplish. Then brainstorm goals 
that can help you meet that ultimate achievement, select the most burning 
ideas, and then start adding measurements and timeframes.
How many goals you create really depends on you. Too many can overwhelm 
you, but too few can make achieving them too easy. Start with two to five 
goals and then adjust if you need.
	
Set a reminder on your phone or calendar to review your goals at regular 
intervals. Blogs change over time, and you might need to rearrange your blog 
design layout to help meet those goals.
Drawing attention to goal-oriented design elements
After you write out your goals, put them in a place where you see them 
often — whether that means you type them on a desktop sticky note or scrib­
ble them on a real sticky note. Keep your goals top of mind because they 
form the basis for many decisions about where to place your design 
elements.
The ways that design can support your goals may surprise you. As you build 
your blog design, take a look at your goals and think about how elements of 
your design, layout, and navigation can be used to meet your goals.
Say you want to increase your e-mail subscriber list by 15 percent in three 
months. The following design decisions can help you meet this goal: 
	
✓	Promote your e-mail offering in a conspicuous space on your home page. 
	
✓	Create an e-mail subscriber box that asks only for an e-mail address 
instead of a first and last name plus an e-mail address. This would make 
subscribing as easy as possible. 
	
✓	Place a subscription box elsewhere on your blog. Perhaps you add the 
subscription box at the bottom of each blog post, to your About page, or 
in your footer.
Carrie with Children (www.carriewithchildren.com) is an example of 
how to adjust your design layout if one of your goals is to bring awareness 
to a certain topic. Carrie writes about many topics but wants to give special 
attention to Down syndrome. To do that, she includes a Down Syndrome tab 
to the right of the popular About tab and features a separate section for Down 
Syndrome posts prominently on her home page (as shown in Figure 3-1).

just yet! Keep your goals handy as you go through this book. You’ll have 
many “aha moments”!
Defining Your Writing
Although this book covers aspects of blog design, your writing and your blog 
design need to be in sync. Everything that surrounds your words affects how 
readers perceive those words.
When you define your writing, blog design choices become easier. I talk 
about all these design elements further into the book, but your niche, voice, 
and tone all influence blog design elements, including

39
 Chapter 3: Getting to Know Your Blog (Even Better)
	
✓	Font choice and size
	
✓	Blog colors
	
✓	Imagery you use
When it comes to defining your niche, voice, and tone, you might find these 
next sections easy, especially if you’ve blogged for a while.
	
Sometimes even experienced bloggers have a hard time describing what they 
write about because they just write what’s top-of-mind and then click the 
Publish button. Even if that’s part of your shtick (say, you’re known for your 
amazing randomness), you should still have an underlying voice and tone 
to your writing. For example, you make even the most mundane parts of life 
sound hysterical.
Carving out a niche (or not)
A niche simply means the topic that you write about. In the blogging world, you 
find two camps: those who believe you must have a niche to be successful, and 
those who think you can be successful without one.
Having a niche can seem more manageable because you have a tighter focus 
and you don’t have to meet the needs of many different audiences. Because 
niche blogging really digs into a specific topic, it’s easier to be seen as an 
expert or a thought leader about your topic. You may also attract more read­
ers because niche blogs can generate more traffic from search engines. 
Not having a niche might give you more flexibility, though, especially if you’re 
passionate about more than one topic but lack the time to run multiple blogs. 
Parent bloggers are a perfect example of this. A mom blogger may share sto­
ries about her children, write about family-friendly recipes, share the latest 
fashion trends, and document a weight loss journey all in one blog.
One great example of blogging without a niche is the blog Jenny on the 
Spot (http://www.jennyonthespot.com), as shown in Figure 3-2. Jenny 
writes about everything from parenting to style to health. She places some 
of her blog’s main topics within easy sight in the navigation menu. Then her 
home page segments her latest blog posts around those topics and more. 
Even though she writes about many things, her blog design and content tie 
together.
On the other hand, not having a niche can hinder your ability to stand out as 
an expert or a leader. Without a niche, you may have a harder time branding 
yourself because you blog design has to encompass the many topics you 
want to write about.

Figure 3-2: The Jenny on the Spot blog covers a range of topics.
Even if you decide you don’t need a niche for your blog, you still need to 
establish your voice and tone. Think about your favorite magazine. That mag­
azine may write about many different topics, but one section doesn’t sound 
like a completely different magazine than another section because the voice 
and tone are consistent.
Showcasing your voice
Voice refers to the distinct personality of your writing. Voice combines atti­
tude, style, and your personal character to give your blog a certain “feel.” If 
your audience could read two very different articles from you and still know 
they’re both written by you, then you’ve mastered your voice.
Defining your voice comes more naturally for some bloggers than others. And 
that’s perfectly okay. More than likely, your voice will also develop as you do 
as a writer. To better define your voice, ask yourself these three questions:

41
 Chapter 3: Getting to Know Your Blog (Even Better)
	
✓	Who are you writing for?
	
✓	Why are you writing?
	
✓	What do you want readers to “get” about you through your writing?
Voice is an integral part to your brand so by answering these questions, 
your voice becomes more apparent and defined. Spend some time with these 
questions because the blog design decisions you make should take your 
voice into consideration. 
	
Readers see your design before they have time to read the content. However, 
your blog design should feel like your voice. For example, if your writing is 
sarcastic and dry, your blog shouldn’t be whimsical or flowery.
You can also emphasize voice in your blog design by how you actually format 
your blog posts. Word choice and sentence structure are part of writing but 
they are visual, too. I dig more into that in Chapter 16.
If you don’t have a niche, really understanding and developing your voice 
and tone becomes even more critical.
Determining your tone
Tone is your blog’s mood or attitude. When you write, do you sound snarky, 
kind, serious, fun, sarcastic, reassuring, helpful, earnest? We lose nonverbal 
communication when we write — your audience doesn’t have the benefit of 
understanding your words through facial expressions, gestures, or the pitch 
of your voice. You have just one thing: tone.
People often confuse tone with voice, but tone is actually part of your voice. 
You’ve likely heard the phrase “tone of voice.” While your voice may be 
humorous, your tone might be sarcastic. The tone of your writing can vary a 
little from post to post, but your voice should remain consistent.
Tone can also vary depending on your target audience or their feelings. 
Think about how you would share big news with an adult friend versus a 
child. You’d probably use different words and inflect your voice differently. 
Or if you were sharing big news with someone who thought might object, you 
might vary your tone again to keep in mind their feelings.
Look over blog posts you’ve written and write down adjectives to describe 
the overall tone in your writing. Then think about what those adjectives do 
and don’t mean. You can see how I did this for my own blog (Momcomm) in 
Table 3-1.

Approachable
Write like I’m helping a

extensive feedback to my pub­
lished weekly critiques.)
Casual
Use contractions; write 
like I’m talking to one

using “yo!” or “y’all”)
I don’t use improper grammar 
or most “text-speak” (I might 
use OMG but not “prolly” for

No matter what your tone, make sure it’s authentic and doesn’t feel forced.
For a really slick look at how a company uses tone to adapt to their audi­
ence’s feelings, check out the MailChimp site Voice and Tone (http://
voiceandtone.com).
Understanding Your Audience
Like voice and tone, your blog design also depends on knowing who your 
audience is and what they want. The more you understand your audience, 
the easier time you’ll have making design decisions (like those I go through 
in Chapter 5). Your audience has an especially strong impact on the following 
design elements:
	
✓	Navigation: When you know your audience, you can organize your blog 
navigation tools so your readers can easily find the content they want. 
	
✓	Home page and overall layout: Your audience can impact the visual 
hierarchy of where content belongs on your blog, particularly your home 
page. For example, if you know your audience enjoys your craft tutorials 
the most, then you could place a button that links to those tutorials near 
the top of your sidebar or always include your latest craft tutorials in a 
rotating gallery towards the top of your home page. You can also start 
applying those core design principles that I talk about in Chapter 2.
	
When getting to know your audience better, you want to look at both your 
current audience and the type of audience you want to attract.

43
 Chapter 3: Getting to Know Your Blog (Even Better)
Knowing your audience can benefit your design
Understanding your audience means that you can design a blog that makes 
them feel comfortable. Your design and layout should not only focus on their 
interests, but also align with your tone and goals.
Here are things you can learn from your audience that benefit your blog 
design:
	
✓	How much content they consume about your topic: If your audience 
wants multiple posts a day (and you have that capacity on your own or 
with contributors), you may choose a different blog layout than some­
one who posts twice weekly. A perfect example would be a deal blogger 
whose readers expect to know about the latest sales and coupons.
	
✓	What answers they’re seeking: Your audience’s content preferences 
can help you decide how often to write about a certain topic. You can 
also build a popular topic into your blog design. If your audience likes 
your video tutorials, you might design a blog page just for those. If your 
audience wants basics about sewing, create a sidebar image that links to 
a page dedicated to sewing for beginners.
	
✓	What platforms or communities they belong to: If your audience heav­
ily uses Pinterest (a social media site for bookmarking and sharing 
links via images), you want the functionality in your blog design to be 
Pinterest-friendly. That means good image titles and easily visible PinIt 
buttons. If they are big Twitter users, you might consider a widget that 
shows your latest tweets.
	
✓	Their basic demographic make-up: If your audience is mostly males in 
their 20s, your site design should look a lot different than a blog whose 
audience is women in their 50s. While you can assume you know your 
audience, you might be surprised by the results. Even though my blog 
name has “mom” in it (Momcomm.com), my site isn’t read by only 
moms.
	
✓	Tech-savvyness: Do your readers have smart phones, tablets, or the 
latest gadgets? Or do they use their computers just for web surfing and 
e-mail? If most of your readers aren’t bloggers, maybe you don’t need 
the CommentLuv plug-in that automatically pulls that commenter’s latest 
blog post. It might be confusing and inhibit someone from leaving a com­
ment. If your blog readers are heavy smartphone users, they’ll appreciate 
a mobile version of your site or even a special mobile phone app.
	
Resist the urge to think that your blog is for anyone and everyone. Without 
a target audience, you water down your writing and make it harder to design 
your blog.

Part I: Getting Started with Blog Design 
Finding out who they are and what they want
After you understand how knowing your audience can make your design 
friendlier, you need some ways to actually gather that information. The best 
place to start in defining your audience is talking to your existing readers. 
You can then look at people who don’t necessarily read your blog but who 
you want as readers.
You might be surprised at the ways you can collect information about your 
audience. Sure, companies pay big bucks for massive surveys, focus groups, 
and other sorts of research. As a blogger, though, you don’t need such in-
depth and precise surveys to find out what your audience wants. Here are a 
few tools to gather information about your audience:
	
✓	Facebook (www.facebook.com):
	
	Ask a valuable question to your fans, friends or group members. Depending 
on the relevance of your topic, ask your fans, Friends, or group members 
a question.
	
	Don’t hound anyone with multiple questions. Ask sparingly and make 
sure your question really gets to what you want to accomplish.
	
	Look at the user profiles of some of your fans. Check out the About 
description and see what other fan pages they like. This might seem a 
little like spying at first, but remember you’re looking at only what that 
person made publicly available.
	
✓	Twitter (https://twitter.com):
	
	Do a search for a hashtag (#topic) or keyword related to your blog topics. 
Within that hashtag or keyword, study the conversations that happen 
within the hashtag, note where these Twitter users link to content, and 
look at their Twitter profiles. 
	
	Peek at your own followers. No, you don’t need to stalk anyone. Just take 
a look at their bio, visit their blogs (if they have one), and get a sense of 
their interests.
	
✓	Quantcast (www.quantcast.com):
	
	See your site’s demographics. After you set up Quantcast on your site 
(it’s free), you can view your profile to see age range, gender, and other 
demographics about your audience.
	
	If you know of blogs in a similar niche as yours (or they write about simi­
lar topics), you can look up their profiles on Quantcast using the search 
feature. If they don’t use Quantcast, they won’t have a profile. It’s also 
worth mentioning that a profile also displays web site traffic but most 
bloggers claim Quantcast doesn’t report traffic very accurately.

45
 Chapter 3: Getting to Know Your Blog (Even Better)
In addition to using the tools in the preceding list, you can get more in-depth 
knowledge about your audience from your audience themselves. Here are a 
couple of techniques to dig deeper into your audience’s opinions and 
preferences: 
	
✓	Interview a few blog readers. Ask them to describe your blog and see 
whether readers’ perceptions align with your own. Ask them whether 
they can find content on your site easily. Find out the types of things 
they will want to see on your blog.
	
✓	Survey your audience. Ask questions about content and how your site 
works. Be careful not to ask directly about your blog design. (You’re the 
one who best knows your goals, voice, and audience. Asking your entire 
readership about colors or fonts can lead to subjective answers that make 
your decision even harder.) You can use these tools to create your survey:
	
•	SurveyMonkey (www.surveymonkey.com): SurveyMonkey is the 
leader in web-based surveys and for good reason: It makes creat­
ing surveys a cinch. With a free account, you get basic reports, 10 
questions per survey, and 100 responses per survey. You can 
actually embed the survey in a blog post or blog page, too.
	
•	Polldaddy (http://polldaddy.com): Polldaddy comes from the 
same company that created Wordpress.com. With a free account, 
you get 10 questions per survey and 200 responses per month. You 
can even survey people from an iPhone or iPad (cool idea if you were 
at an event or conference) and also embed the survey on your blog.
	
•	Google Drive (https://drive.google.com): Through Google 
Drive, you can create a form that drops answers into a spreadsheet 
for you to analyze. You can also embed the form into a blog post 
or a blog page. While you can easily create a form with questions, 
Google Drive doesn’t turn multiple choice answers into quantifi­
able data. For example, if you want to find out what percentage of 
those surveyed answered a. Excellent to your first question, then 
you have to do the math yourself using the spreadsheet formulas. 
For this reason, Google Drive works best for surveys when you ask 
open-ended questions that don’t need to be quantified. 
You might think I’m missing an obvious place to gain insight into your audience: 
blog analytics, such as Google Analytics. But don’t worry — I devote an entire 
section to it in Chapter 5.
	
What your readers answer on certain survey questions may contradict with 
what your analytics program tells you about your most popular types of posts 
or topics. For example, your analytics may show your most popular posts are 
on a topic readers don’t rank as one of their favorite topics. Because some 

46
Part I: Getting Started with Blog Design 
of your traffic may be from visitors who come from search engines but don’t 
turn into regular readers, be sure to compare survey results with your traffic 
patterns. That way, you’ll gather a more complete picture of what your audi­
ence and potential audience both want. 
Creating a user persona
After you have a solid understanding of who your target audience is, consider 
developing user personas to paint an ever clearer picture. A user persona is a 
short profile that describes a segment of your audience.
Think of personas as your “fake real people.” Even if your target audience 
seems pretty straightforward, you might have different segments within your 
audience. For example, if you write a blog about photography, you might 
have a nonprofessional looking for tips on taking better photos or an amateur 
photographer looking to build a photography business. Personas bring to life 
these segments by creating a fake name, picture, and description of these dif­
ferent audience segments.
	
Sometimes people think that building personas means that you’re stereo­
typing your audience. However, think about personas more like archetypes 
rather than stereotypes. Archetypes seek to create a general model of a per­
sonality or behavior, whereas stereotypes seek to demean a type of person 
by emphasizing clichéd or predictable behavior.
Personas can help you make better decisions about your blog. Every time 
you launch an e-mail, start to create a promotion, or have a brilliant idea for a 
new blog post series, pull out your personas. Does that “thing” resonate with 
one of them — or better yet, a few of them?
Then, after you understand your audience more thoroughly, you can move to 
making decisions for your blog design.

Establishing a Style Guide
In This Chapter
▶	Looking at why you need a style guide
▶	Deciding what to add to your guide
▶	Building your guide
▶	Understanding special considerations for blogs with multiple contributors
W

ouldn’t it be great to have one place you could refer to regarding all 
the design and content decisions you make for your blog? Well, that’s 
where a style guide comes in.
Both print and web designers have long used style guides. A company might 
have an editorial style guide that lays out their content’s voice and tone. They 
might also have a branding style guide or brand book that provides detailed 
information about their brand’s core message along with branding do’s and 
don’ts. I once saw a large company’s guide that was nearly 100 pages long!
As a blogger, you don’t have to go that crazy. You can combine everything 
into a simple style guide for your blog. This chapter explores why you should 
create a style guide and what to potentially include in yours. I also show you 
how easy it is to create a simple style guide. Finally, I walk you through special 
considerations for blogs with multiple contributors.
Exploring the Benefits of a Style Guide
You might think that spending time on creating a style guide seems like a 
complicated process that only bigger blogs need. Or that such a guide just 
adds to your to-do list. The truth is any blogger can benefit from a style 
guide — and it’s really easy to create one.
As your blog grows, you’ll find yourself looking for ways to be more productive. 
Having a style guide saves you time so you aren’t pouring through your blog 
or your design files trying to remember what exact shade of blue you use in 
your header or whether you capitalize a certain word. You can peek at your 
style guide for the answer — and then quickly get to work.

48
Part I: Getting Started with Blog Design 
	
If you build your guide bit by bit as you work through your blog design, you’ll 
hardly feel like you did any extra work at all. I’m not kidding!
Building a foundation of reference material
As you start redesigning your blog — or even build a design from scratch — 
you make decisions that guide how you want your blog to look and your con­
tent formatted. However, as time goes on, you might find you don’t remember 
to always use the guides you created in the first place.
Luckily, you don’t have to remember everything because (wait for it) a style 
guide remembers for you. By building a style guide as a foundation, you have 
just one file to reference versus searching for something in a design file, your 
blog, or somewhere else altogether.
Plus, if you decide to extend your blog’s design into other places — say, custom 
graphics for your Facebook page or for a business card (see Chapter 17) — 
you’ll pat yourself on the back for having all your blog’s styles in one place.
	
Your style guide is an excellent resource if you ever collaborate with someone 
on a project for your blog. For example, if you work with a designer to help 
you create a custom Twitter background, you can share your style guide with 
the designer, so he or she knows exactly what colors your blog design uses. If 
anyone writes a guest post for your blog, you can share a modified version of 
your guide (or paste it into an e-mail) to outline how you capitalize your post 
titles, what size the post images should be, and other post guidelines.
Creating consistency throughout your blog
As I mention in Chapter 2, consistency is one of the core design principles 
of good design and branding. Consistency gives your blog a polished, 
professional look.
	
Blog readers often subconsciously notice inconsistencies in blog design and 
content, such as the difference in two shades of blue or the fact that you wrote 
USA and U.S.A. in the same blog post. Although these inconsistencies most 
likely won’t deter a reader from returning to your blog, the inconsistencies 
do add up and take their toll in the following ways:
	
✓	From a writing perspective, inconsistencies within blog posts are like little 
speed bumps, slowing down your reader and hindering concentration. 
	
✓	From a blog design perspective, inconsistencies can give your blog a 
sloppy feel, even if your reader can’t quite place exactly why. 

49
 Chapter 4: Establishing a Style Guide
	
✓	Good marketing and public relations representatives you may want to 
partner with do notice consistency. Your blog writing and design are, in 
a way, your personal brand. If you pay attention to the details in your 
blog, you have a better chance of attracting partners who value a similar 
attention to detail and standards for quality.
	
A style guide gives you an easy way to maintain consistency because your 
design and content decisions all live in one document. When you have a 
guide to reference, you make it easier on yourself (and others) to keep your 
blog brand strong.
Identifying Elements to Include
Because you probably don’t have a marketing team, design team, PR team, 
and other sorts of teams at your disposal (well, I don’t anyway), you can 
build your style guide to combine many sorts of things into one guide. The 
ideas I give you in this section include not only design-related pieces, but 
also things to include for content, linking, and post length.
	
This is your style guide, not mine or anyone else’s. You can decide exactly 
what you find worth including and how much detail you want to provide. 
If you don’t think you’ll reference something, don’t include it. This section 
merely seeks to give you lots of ideas.
Defining your blog’s purpose, voice, and tone
Your blog’s purpose provides the backbone for your blog design. Your blog’s 
voice and tone bring that purpose to life.
You may know your blog’s purpose by heart and be comfortable with your 
own voice and tone, but writing all this down serves as a gentle reminder 
of what you typically expect your blog to be. When you’re deciding on blog 
changes or opportunities, referencing your blog’s overall purpose, voice, and 
tone can bring clarity to making decisions that truly fit your blog.
	
If you end up creating personas, as I recommend in Chapter 3, you could 
include a short version of them in your style guide as well to remind you of 
the audiences you’re trying to attract.
Formatting blog post titles
Your blog post titles not only need to grab attention due to their content, but 
they should also be consistent from post to post. Multiple blog post titles 
are often seen together on one page, such as when you have short teasers on 
your home page that lead to full posts. Plus, you have new readers who are 

50
Part I: Getting Started with Blog Design 
soaking up post after post and regu­
lar readers who surely read every one 
of your posts. So, if there’s one place 
to apply consistency, consider blog 
post titles one of the most important.
Here are a few things you may want 
to include in your style guide regard­
ing post titles:
	
✓	Capitalization: Do you write your 
post titles in title case, sentence 
case, lowercase, or uppercase 
(see Figure 4-1)? If you use Title 
Case, typical style does not cap­
italize articles (such as a, an, 
and the) or prepositions (like 
on, from, or by). You could keep 
a list in your style guide to remind you which words you don’t capitalize.
	
✓	Word or character count: Do you want to stick to a certain number of 
words or characters so that your titles look uniform or so they take up 
only a certain number of lines?
	
✓	Labels to special posts: When you have a guest blogger, do a product 
review, or run a weekly series, do you include a specific label in the title? 
Here’s an example: starting every review with Review:.
	
✓	Special formatting: Do you want to apply any other styles to your blog 
post titles? If you write a lot of news-related blog posts, perhaps you 
adapt that more journalistic style. For example, journalistic writing often 
eliminates articles in the beginning headlines (a, an and the) and uses 
a comma in place of and. As another example, maybe you want all blog 
post titles to end in punctuation like a period, question, or exclamation 
point.
Knowing how to structure a blog post
Applying certain guidelines to how you structure a blog post can help read­
ers feel more comfortable with your writing and even reinforce your blog 
voice. When it comes to laying out your blog posts, here are some things to 
consider:
	
✓	Post length: You may want your posts to stick to a certain length either 
because of how your posts look visually or because you’ve determined 
that your readers prefer a shorter (or longer) post.
	
✓	Paragraph length: Long paragraphs hinder readability. You may limit 
paragraphs to a certain number of lines. Or you may style your posts so 
that each paragraph is just a few words or a short sentence.
Figure 4-1: Choose from post title capitalization 
options.

51
 Chapter 4: Establishing a Style Guide
	
✓	Image placement: If you wrap 
text around your images, your 
style guide can specify that and 
whether the image floats to the 
left or right side of the text. Or 
your style guide might specify 
that images are centered in the 
column above or below the text 
in a blog post. You can also 
clarify whether image place­
ment changes depending on the 
type of post you write.
	
✓	Headings: Headings visually 
guide readers through your 
blog posts. HTML gives you up 
to six levels, with 1 being the 
most important heading. Within 
HTML, tags written as <h1>, 
<h2>, and so on indicate a 
heading’s level. Blog post titles 
are <h1> headings; then, within 
your blog posts, you can use 
any level heading.
	
	For your headings, you might choose to make them all one font, or 
maybe switch to another font when you get down to a certain level, like 
mine do (see Figure 4-2). Also, you may choose to write your blog post 
titles in Title Case but other headings lowercase. (Psst. You might notice 
that this book’s style uses Title Case main headings and Sentence case 
subheadings.)
	
	If a certain heading size looks too small, stick with certain levels for your 
blog posts — and denote that in your style guide.
Remembering your color palette
Because colors are one of your blog’s most stand-out assets, you want to keep 
the shades you selected consistent. You’ll find a reference of your blog’s color 
palette to be an especially handy tool, and your style guide is the perfect 
place for this color reference.
When listing your colors in your style guide, I suggest you show the colors 
and list the technical specifications for each color you use. 
Figure 4-2: Use blog heading levels to guide 
your reader.

52
Part I: Getting Started with Blog Design 
	
✓	Showing the colors: Most word processors enable you to add a square 
shape and fill it with color. To get the exact colors, look for a Custom 
Colors option or something similar among the formatting options for a 
shape. I used the Colors dialog box in Microsoft Word for the Mac 2011 
to add the color squares you see in Figure 4-3.
	
✓	Listing the technical specs: As I explain in Chapter 6, on the web, colors 
are specified using RGB values or hexadecimal codes. Include both the 
RGB and the hexadecimal value for each color. 
For my style guide, I made simple squares in Microsoft Word so that my style 
guide includes a visual representation of each color, as shown in Figure 4-3. I 
then added a table to show all the color values.
Figure 4-3: My blog colors listed in my style guide.
Ensuring correct usage of fonts
Like colors, the fonts you use on your blog can make your blog design more 
memorable. (Hint: Chapter 6 is devoted to both fonts and colors.) You prob­
ably use more than one font on your blog, so for this part of your guide, dis­
play the fonts that you use for specific areas of your site.
Here are some places within your blog design where you might want to list 
what font or fonts you use and possibly their size:
	
✓	Blog header (blog name and tagline)
	
✓	Main blog post content

53
 Chapter 4: Establishing a Style Guide
	
✓	Sidebar or footer content
	
✓	Special blog buttons
You can see how I did this for my 
style guide in Figure 4-4. 
If you’ve played around with your 
fonts and know at what font size 
they look too gigantic, you may want 
to also note that in your guide. The 
same goes for the minimum size to 
use before your font becomes hard 
to read.
Applying consistent 
imagery
Images on your blog are so important 
to your blog design and your brand­
ing that I devote an entire chapter to 
them (see Chapter 15). Some things 
you might want to include in this 
section of your style guide are
	
✓	Recommended width of images 
for your blog post: I like to 
include widths for both horizon­
tal and vertical images. Vertical 
images that run the width of 
my main column look gigantic, so I size them smaller than a horizontal 
image.
	
✓	Sizes for design files: In addition to images for your blog posts, you may 
end up creating designs for
	
•	Your blog’s Facebook page
	
•	Your Twitter profile
	
•	Your Google Plus page
	
•	An e-mail newsletter
	
•	Your sidebar
	
•	Social media icons for your blog 
	
•	More places to extend your blog design that I cover in Chapter 17
Figure 4-4: Font guidelines for my blog.

54
Part I: Getting Started with Blog Design 
	
	Because you probably aren’t 
updating most of these design 
files frequently, you save time 
by not having to search through 
old files for the right size. If you 
use a design program like 
Photoshop that saves a file that 
you can edit again, then you 
might not need to list file sizes. 
However, if you use a program 
like PicMonkey, then listing file 
sizes in your style guide comes 
in handy because you can’t edit 
a file again once you leave the 
application.
	
✓	Pinterest-friendly image for­
matting: As Pinterest (a social 
media site for bookmarking and sharing links via images) increases in 
popularity, many bloggers are creating images with text to grab some­
one’s attention on Pinterest. See one that I did in Figure 4-5. For my 
Pinterest images, I often like to extend beyond my blog’s colors and 
fonts and use colors or fonts that complement my branding. Write down 
things like the following:
	
•	Colors
	
•	Fonts
	
•	Branding (Do you use your logo? URL? Watermark?)
	
	Keeping within some parameters will keep you from spending too 
much time re-inventing the wheel every time you want to create a new 
Pinterest graphic. (Trust me — been there, done that.)
	
✓	Images not to use: Are there certain styles of images you don’t want 
to use? For example, when using stock photography with models, you 
might decide that candid shots work better than models who are posed.
	
✓	Preferred image sources: If you find yourself using stock images or 
illustrations over and over from certain artists, include a list of favorite 
artists and links to their profiles on the places where you source their 
images.
Listing frequently used words
Every blogger has words or phrases that they use often, but perhaps you 
don’t use them often enough to remember exactly how you write them. 
Figure 4-5: A Pinterest-friendly image.

55
 Chapter 4: Establishing a Style Guide
Funny enough — I sell an e-book on my blog but often forget whether I typi­
cally use e-book or eBook.
	
You want to use words and phrases consistently from blog post to blog post. 
Although you might be tempted to not worry about how you’ve written that 
word in the past (or even in the same blog post), consistency makes your 
blog more professional — and, depending on the word, eliminates any poten­
tial confusion.
Of course, you don’t need to worry about words that don’t have potential for 
confusion, such as the town you live in. Include only those words that can 
be written numerous ways or that you have a hard time remembering how 
to write. Words with accents, hyphens, or specific capitalization are often 
words that you need help remembering.
	
You might wonder how most people determine how to write a specific word. 
You can often find the answer by doing a search for the word plus the phrase 
AP Style or Chicago Manual of Style. These are two stylebooks used by most 
publishers — and in some cases, the answer will be different between the 
two sources. For many words, there’s no right or wrong way. Just pick a way 
and then stick with it.
Attribution of photos or quotes
When you use free photos within your blog post, the photographer often 
requires that you give him or her credit for the photo. To do so, you need to 
attribute that photo within the photo caption. To stay consistent, decide how 
you want to format the attribution and then add it to your style guide.
This also applies to attributing quotes on your blog. You can show how you 
attribute a quote or photo to someone, like this:
–Name (website name, if applicable)
	
Depending on the photo you’re using, you may need to attribute a photo in a 
certain way. (For example, some photographers want you to use a copyright 
symbol; others request the wording Courtesy of . . . A free photo service may 
want you to include the service name as well as the photographer’s name.) 
Be sure to check the licensing agreement.
Keeping handy your latest biography
If you’re like me, you’ve probably been asked to provide someone with an 
author biography, and you go sifting through previous guest posts or old 

56
Part I: Getting Started with Blog Design 
e-mails trying to find a bio you used at some point in the past. I quickly real­
ized that wasn’t too productive (no, really!) and decided to add my bios to 
my style sheet as well. True, a bio isn’t really design related, but maintaining 
consistency is never a bad thing.
So, in my style sheet, I keep my main bio, a shortened version, and a first-
person version. I also include word counts for each version because you 
might be asked to provide only a 100-word or 50-word biography.
Creating Your Style Guide
After you gather what goes into your style guide, now it’s time to put your 
guide together. You could create something fancy, but I recommend building 
your style guide in a word processing document — like Microsoft Word — or 
within Google Docs. (And with Google Docs, you can access your style guide 
from anywhere with an Internet connection.)
My guide starts with my blog name and the date I last updated the guide. 
From there, I include my blog’s voice and tone. After those core items, my 
best piece of advice is this: Keep your most referenced material at the top. 
You don’t want to dig for the styles you continually need to reference. For 
me, that’s my color breakdowns and frequently used words.
Just like your blog design, you want your style guide to have visual com­
ponents to it. That way, you can easily scan your guide for the information 
you’re looking for.
Here are a few ways to visually break up your style guide for easy scanning:
	
✓	Headings for each section
	
✓	Screenshots for certain parts of your blog to illustrate a style in action
	
✓	Color key of colors used in your blog
	
✓	Font names you use shown in the actual fonts
	
✓	Simple tables
Finally, build this document as you make decisions regarding your blog design 
instead of doing it all at once. If there are aspects of your current design that 
you plan to keep, put those in the document now.
	
You don’t have to make your style guide overly complex. Even simply listing 
your color breakdowns or writing down the fonts you use works. The key is 
that you can reference the information easily when you need it.

 Chapter 4: Establishing a Style Guide
Developing Guidelines for Blogs 
with Multiple Contributors
If you have more than one regular contributor on your blog, having a style 
guide becomes infinitely more important. You want your content to match 
your blog design, but keeping that consistency becomes harder when you’re 
not the only person writing. When you have a style guide to share as a starting 
point for guest bloggers, you can bring new contributors up to speed faster.
In addition to the things I mention earlier in the chapter, here are some 
extra guidelines to consider including for a blog with multiple writers: Some 
of these guidelines might not relate directly to blog design, navigation, or 
formatting, but they all contribute to consistency — and, in some cases, the 
reputation of your blog’s brand.
	
✓	Title guidelines: Outline the length of a blog post title or any special ways 
that contributors should write them. You may even provide suggestions 
and examples for writing a strong blog post title.
	
✓	Limits to linking back to the contributor’s own blog: Guest bloggers 
benefit from writing as a contributor partly because they can add links 
to their own blogs within their guest posts. So that your contributors 
don’t get carried away, though, you may want to impose limits to how 
many times in a blog post they can link back to their own blog (or at 
least mention to use good judgment).
	
✓	Writing rules: These rules aren’t for you — you don’t need to be 
reminded — but they are for your guest bloggers because not everyone 
writes the same way. When working with multiple contributors, your 
styles should be mentioned so no one has to spend time editing all blog 
posts to be the same. For example, people who learned to type on a 
typewriter will often use two spaces after a period instead of one, so
 you might need to remind writers to use only one space. Or, you might 
mention whether to use a comma after “and” in a serial list (“red, white, 
and blue” versus “red, white and blue”).
	
✓	Formatting tips for author bios: If your contributors need to stick to a 
certain word count for layout purposes, remind them to include links 
to some of their social media platforms and any other tips you want to 
provide on how to structure their author bios.
	
✓	Original content rules: Tell your contributors whether you allow them 
to republish content already published on another blog or website.
	
✓	Caution words: Outline certain words or phrases that you don’t want to 
be used on your blog. For example, you may not want bloggers to use 
profanity, or there may be expressions (or even entire topics) you don’t 
want used on your blog.

58
Part I: Getting Started with Blog Design 
	
✓	Do Not Mentions: Do Not Mentions are links that you don’t want contrib­
utors to include in their blog posts. You may not want them to reference 
a business that you don’t trust or a website that sells a product you 
wouldn’t recommend.
	
✓	Recommended Resources: On the flipside of the Do Not Mentions, you 
can list trusted resources to link to or places to gather research. Having 
these resources handy might also encourage contributors to link to 
these sites.

D

ecisions, decisions. Blog design is full of decisions. When you think 
about all the possibilities out there, it’s easy to overwhelm yourself 
with all the directions you could take. Ack!
Earlier chapters in this book give you a good grasp on some core design 
principles, helping you identify your audience (or who you want it to be) and 
establishing some concrete goals for your blog. With that knowledge tucked 
into your back pocket, it’s time to take a deep breath and start narrowing 
down your focus.
Although you still have many more decisions to make (as explored in later 
chapters), this chapter gets you actively gathering design ideas that will form 
the foundation for your overall design. For this chapter, roll up your sleeves 
to put together a mood board and study other blog designs. Here, you can 
also read how to make navigation design decisions based on your own ana­
lytics. Finally, I guide you through one of the biggest decisions of all: whether 
to design your blog yourself, purchase a design template, or hire someone to 
design your blog for you.
Creating a Mood Board — And Why
Back in your school days, do you remember grabbing a giant white poster 
board and pasting it full of cutouts from magazines and newspapers? That 
collage you made was essentially a mood board.

62
Part II: Choosing the Visual Design Elements 
Techniques for creating a collage of ideas have evolved (although I show 
you how to make one by hand, too), the purpose of creating a mood board 
remains the same: From fashion design to interior design to corporate design 
creation, people use mood boards as a way to explore creative inspiration 
and spark creative ideas.
A mood board conveys a design idea by mixing textures, words, images, 
colors, and more. You may think that making mood boards sounds like a 
waste of time — but don’t underestimate them without giving it a shot. As a 
blogger, mood boards kick-start the creative process for designing your blog.
	
You don’t have to know exactly what your blog design vision is at this point. 
That’s what your mood board is for! Use it as a tool to explore and play with 
your ideas. Your board doesn’t have to be logical nor does everything you 
add have to tie together. If something makes an impression on you, include it!
Regardless of who ends up actually developing the design, mood boards save 
time in the long run because through this exploration process, you can take 
those fuzzy ideas and begin creating a clearer vision of what you want to 
your blog design to be.
	
In Chapter 3, I talk about voice and tone. Using the words that describe your 
voice and the tone of your blog makes a good starting point for creating a 
design mood board. Start looking for images that represent those words.
Even if it takes you a while to create a mood board, consider it time well 
spent because you gain a better a sense of the look and feel you want to 
achieve in your blog design. And if you’re turning over your design to a 
designer, a mood board can give the designer a better idea of the blog you 
envision.
Compiling ideas by hand
Creating a mood board by hand might be a little old-fashioned, but you’ll find 
that doing something tactile can really spark ideas for your blog design. Plus, 
you can add certain elements to a mood board that you can’t do with digital 
versions (unless you have certain tools like a scanner or pen tablet).
Start with a large surface on which to place your ideas (say, poster board, 
corkboard, or even some wall space), some pens and colored markers, paper, 
scissors, and tacks or glue. Find a space in your home where you can spread 
out and get to work.

63
 Chapter 5: Gathering Design Ideas
Here are a few things you can add to 
a mood board created by hand:
	
✓	Pictures: Images from magazines 
or newspapers, personal photo­
graphs, printed screenshots
	
✓	Words: Words, samples of fonts, 
phrases, or quotes
	
✓	Color: Paint swatches, paper, 
paint, markers
	
✓	Ephemera: Trinkets, memora­
bilia, or other things that relate 
to your blog topic (like your first 
opera ticket that turned you into 
an opera fanatic)
	
✓	Doodles: Your own drawings or 
drawings from others
For the mood board you see in 
Figure 5-1, I compiled font ideas, 
quotes, images, and other elements 
that fit my style.
Brainstorming on Pinterest
Pinterest, one of the world’s most popular social media platform, works like 
an online pin board. You create boards around a specific topic and then add 
pins from your own image library or other things you want to bookmark from 
around the web. Pinterest is all about visual appeal.
As a tool for creating mood boards, Pinterest gives you an easy way to show­
case your ideas and things that inspire you. In Figure 5-2, you can see how 
a mood board can translate into design. Laura Mayes from Blog con Queso 
(http://thequeso.com) shared her Pinterest board with her designer, 
who then created a eye-catching design to reflect her love of color.
Figure 5-1: Start with a mood board, created 
by hand.

Figure 5-2: See how a Pinterest board can translate into a blog design.
Pinterest has some advantages that make creating a mood board extra easy:
	
✓	Secret Boards: If you don’t want your mood board to be seen by every­
one, use Secret Boards, which stay private until you delete them or make 
them public. Visit your profile and scroll to the bottom of the page to 
click Create a Secret Board. You can also go on a pinning spree without 
overloading your followers’ feeds with 20 pictures of fonts you like.
	
✓	Multiple boards: If you aren’t sure of the design style you want for your 
blog, make multiple boards, each with its own unique look and feel. You 
can play around with different styles without lumping them into one 
board.
	
✓	Contributor boards: With Pinterest, you can invite other pinners to pin 
to your board. This comes in handy if your blog has multiple contribu­
tors who may want to contribute ideas to the blog design. You can even 
ask your pinning-obsessed friends to contribute to your board if they 
come across anything that really fits your style or personality.

65
 Chapter 5: Gathering Design Ideas
	
When searching for ideas on Pinterest itself, don’t be surprised if your search 
query comes up short with results. Pinterest’s search function isn’t very 
helpful most of the time because it partly relies on pinners providing a help­
ful pin description. Remember: Search engines can’t interpret images, so 
they rely on text. Try Google instead but add Pinterest to the end of your 
search query. You often get results for Pinterest boards or pins that you 
might not otherwise find through Pinterest.
Keeping track of ideas with Evernote
If a handmade board or one on Pinterest doesn’t seem appealing, try Evernote 
to collect items for a blog design mood board. Evernote (http://evernote.
com) is a program that makes it easy for you to store articles, images, and 
even your own audio recordings in one place. Evernote also has a robust app 
for smart phones and tablets that syncs with the desktop application.
You can use Evernote as a place to contain and organize anything related to 
your mood board. In Evernote, you organize Notes into Notebooks. Notes can 
be a saved article, a photo, an audio clip, or text that’s typed directly into 
Evernote. I sometimes jot down ideas in a physical notebook and then take 
a picture from my Evernote phone app so I don’t misplace them. Similar to a 
mood board done by hand, you could also doodle or sketch an idea and then 
photograph it for Evernote. The app even turns your handwriting and text 
from images into searchable content. In Figure 5-3, you can see a mood board 
Notebook that I created.
Figure 5-3: Create a mood board notebook in Evernote.

66
Part II: Choosing the Visual Design Elements 
	
To save online inspiration — fonts, images, or even entire websites — install 
the Evernote Web Clipper, which allows you easily to clip articles from 
around the web.
When you’re ready to start compiling your inspiration into a mood board, 
take screenshots from your notes then lay them out in a collage using a pro­
gram like PicMonkey (www.picmonkey.com) or Photoshop. (I talk about 
PicMonkey collages in Chapter 15.) Or just keep your ideas in Evernote. 
Whatever works for you.
Studying Other Blogs
When you look at other blogs with an eye for design and navigation, you 
might be surprised by all the inspiration you gain. A single design element on 
someone’s blog could give you an idea for a blog header. Or someone’s main 
blog color may be the perfect shade to sprinkle through your design in much 
smaller doses.
Surveying the blogging landscape also helps you spot trends in blog design 
or discover new plug-ins or widgets you may want to use.
This section walks you through what to look for when it comes to another 
blog’s design and navigation. I also challenge you to look at blogs focused on 
topics completely different from yours. Doing so can give you a fresh design 
perspective.
	
Imitation isn’t the same as inspiration. If someone would look at your design 
and think (or say), “That looks just like so-and-so’s blog!”, then someone 
might say you copied a design. The more blogs that inspire you, the less your 
blog will look like someone else’s.
Knowing what to look for
Surfing from blog to blog, looking at nice designs, is fun, but keep your jaunts 
productive, too. Keep a short list of things to look for on another person’s 
blog. Then take notes about anything you like about someone’s blog design. 
You can also keep track of things that inspire you by using some mood board 
ideas, as I describe in the previous section.
To kick-start your list, here are some things you can look at:
	
✓	Overall branding: Look at how the blog name, tagline, blog colors, 
fonts, and other design elements tie in to one another. How many fonts 
www.allitebooks.com

67
 Chapter 5: Gathering Design Ideas
and colors are used? How did the blogger or designer create hierarchy 
with them?
	
✓	General layout: Are two columns or three used? Note any special galleries 
or rotating banners and the number of blog posts featured on the home 
page.
	
✓	Sidebars: See what key content is placed on the sidebar. Can you easily 
discern a hierarchy that signals to you what is most important?
	
✓	Advertising: Is the advertising overbearing to you as a blog visitor? Is 
advertising shown in unusual places? How many potential advertisers 
are allowed? Is there a special blog page created just for advertisers?
	
✓	Navigation: How is top content displayed? What about a search box? 
Where are categories listed?
	
✓	Interaction: Do readers leave lots of comments and share their posts on 
social media platforms? If so, look at how the blog’s commenting system 
and social sharing buttons function.
	
✓	Footer: If the blog has a footer, what things are included? How does the 
footer design fit into the rest of the blog design?
	
Just because a certain design element works on one blog doesn’t mean that 
it will work for you. Use other sites for inspiration but stay true to your own 
style and personality.
Looking outside your niche
By looking within just your own niche, you may inadvertently box yourself 
into a certain way of thinking. You might find yourself including something 
in your design because everyone else does, when it might not be the right 
choice for your blog. Looking outside your niche can help you bring a fresh 
approach to your own niche.
Look at blogs outside your niche and even corporate websites or company 
blogs.
However, in addition to looking at things that all blogs have (blog colors, a 
navigation menu, and so on), consider how you can apply part of a blog’s 
design or navigation to your own blog. For example, if you write about travel, 
perhaps you notice how food bloggers often take close-up shots of their food. 
Maybe you get the idea to incorporate a close-up travel shot into your blog 
header versus a typical scenic landscape. Check out the many possibilities to 
take a fresh twist on your blog design!

Part II: Choosing the Visual Design Elements 
Digging into Blog Analytics to 
Improve Navigation Design
Making your blog design easy to navigate means that visitors are more likely 
to return. Even if they never subscribe to your blog or follow you on a social 
network, effective navigation design means your visitors can find the content 
they need or explore your blog more easily.
In this section, I assume that you’re using Google Analytics (www.google.
com/analytics) to track your blog’s statistics. Of course, you might be 
using another program like Clicky (http://clicky.com) or Statcounter 
(http://statcounter.com), and that’s okay, too. You should be able to 
find similar data within these analytics programs even if the presentation of 
the data might vary. 
If you’re unfamiliar with analytics, you can find an overview of Google Analytics 
and Clicky at www.dummies.com. Although the process of setting up Google 
Analytics on your blog is beyond the scope of this book, know that you need 
to already have a blog. 
In this section, I tackle a few areas where you can uncover navigation or func­
tionality issues that may hinder a visitor’s experience with your blog navigation 
design. Although you can surely go deeper into analytics, these next few sec­
tions give you a good grasp of how visitors use your site and what you can 
learn from that data.
Uncovering navigation issues 
by looking at bounce rate
A bounce rate is the percentage of visitors who leave your blog without visit­
ing more than one page. If I land on your home page, read awhile, and then 
leave your blog, that counts as a bounce. If I follow a direct link to an older 
posts or a page of yours and then leave, that’s a bounce, too. Any bounce rate 
less than 60% is typically considered decent — and rate less than 40% is 
pretty darn good.
This is why you want to track bounce rate: When you have a lower bounce 
rate, not only are you getting visitors to stay on your blog longer, but you’re 
also helping them easily get the information they’re looking for by guiding 
them with good navigation design.

69
 Chapter 5: Gathering Design Ideas
	
People are naturally skimmers when it comes to online content. If you can 
make both your content and navigation design awesome, you’ll keep people 
on your site longer.
To find the bounce rate for individual posts and pages, take the following steps.
	
1.	Visit your Google Analytics dashboard (https://www.google.com/
analytics/web) and log in.
	
	 If you have more than one blog, select the blog you want to look at.
	
2.	From the left-side menu, choose Content➪Site Content➪All Pages.
	
	This brings up data on all individual blog posts and pages, sorted by 
page views.
	
3.	Click the Performance button (see Figure 5-4).
	
	 Look for the third button on the far right; it looks like three stacked bars.
	
	 By choosing to view the data using Performance, you can pull up two 
sets of data to compare.
Performance button
Choose Bounces from this menu
Figure 5-4: Look at page views to bounce rate.
	
4.	Choose Bounces from the right drop-down menu.
	
	 Because the left column already reads Pageviews, you can now see the 
bounce rate of your posts and pages with the highest number of page 
views. See Figure 5-4.

70
Part II: Choosing the Visual Design Elements 
On your blog’s home page (shown by a forward slash, /), a high bounce rate 
isn’t necessarily a bad thing. If your blog layout has more than one full article 
on your page, visitors might read more than one post. They could even share 
your article via social media without affecting your bounce rate one way or 
the other. However, if your blog’s home page design shows only partial blog 
posts with links to Read more, a high bounce rate could signify trouble.
Here are some reasons that prevent visitors from navigating to other parts of 
your blog:
	
✓	Wrong keyword or phrase: People find your blog post or page with 
keywords that aren’t actually relevant to that page’s content.
	
✓	Outdated information: Your blog post may contain content that needs 
to be updated. You could reference a product that’s no longer available, 
your tutorial could refer to an old version of a product, and so on.
	
✓	Visual appeal: Does this blog post have an image? Is there enough con­
trast between your text and your background? Are your fonts hard to 
read? Any of these reasons could make a visitor click the Back button 
and leave your site.
	
✓	Nowhere to go next: Are you linking enough to other pages relevant 
to that topic? Often, I find that plug-ins that automatically pull related 
posts aren’t enough to get people to click. Try including links to relevant 
posts within your text (interlinking) or adding a call to action at the end 
where you suggest what similar post to read next (which can lead a 
reader to take action by visiting another blog post).
	
✓	Technical issues: Does the page have random code showing? Is an 
image broken? Is something else not rendering properly? If a page looks 
awkward, a visitor may leave your site.
On the flip side of a high bounce rate, a really low bounce rate (like less than 
10%) could potentially signify navigation design issues as well. If your blog 
has less than a 10% bounce rate, look closer at your overall navigation struc­
ture. Your navigation may confuse visitors or make visitors click through 
too many pages to find what they’re looking for. Then again, it may just be a 
really great bounce rate!
Finding opportunities to highlight key content
You want visitors to notice your best content. Looking at your most viewed 
content in Google Analytics can help you undercover ways to bring that con­
tent to a new audience. To see the most viewed content on your blog, follow 
these instructions:
	
1.	Visit your Google Analytics dashboard (https://www.google.com/
analytics/web) and log in.
	
	 If you have more than one blog, select the blog you want to look at.

71
 Chapter 5: Gathering Design Ideas
	
2.	From the left-side menu, choose Content➪Overview.
	
	This brings up data on all individual blog posts and pages, sorted by 
highest number of page views.
	
3.	On the bottom right of the screen, select View Full Report.
	
	 You see your top ten pages and each page’s page views, average time on 
page, bounce rate, new visitors, and more. See Figure 5-5.
Figure 5-5: Top content sorted by highest number of page views.
After you’re able to dig in and see what content is the most and least popular, 
you might find that you can do the following in your blog design:
	
✓	Highlight new visitor opportunities. If certain pages get a high percent­
age of new visitors, make sure those visitors come back. You could 
create a custom welcome message on these pages that directs them to 
a Start Here page, to a newsletter subscription page, or to follow you on 
Twitter.
	
✓	Showcase great but overlooked content. As you look through this report, 
you may start to see that some of your great content isn’t getting as 
many page views as you’d like. If this content really shouldn’t be missed, 
you may decide to highlight it on your sidebar. You might also want to 
check that you properly categorized the post so readers can navigate to 
it more easily.
	
✓	Build new targeted pages. As you look through your top content, you 
may consider designing a new blog page that not only highlights a top 
post but also gives you an opportunity to showcase other similar posts. 

72
Part II: Choosing the Visual Design Elements 
Perhaps you ran a blog post series around a certain topic. You could 
create a page that highlights the entire series. 
	
	Or perhaps one of your top posts is part of a category that you want to 
highlight on your blog. You can create a page highlighting some posts 
from that category and add a link to see the rest of the posts in that cat­
egory. You could even create a blog page like Reader Favorites or Best 
of the Year that highlight unrelated, yet popular, posts.
	
	After you create a targeted page like one of these, you can build that 
page into your navigation menu design or add a graphic in your sidebar 
that directs people to the page.
I once ran a series on my blog about 
blogger business cards. Two of the 
posts had great traffic, but the other 
three did not. I created a new page 
that incorporated all five posts and 
linked to each separate post. To 
draw attention to this page, I created 
a banner on my sidebar, as shown in 
Figure 5-6.
Looking at referral traffic
Referral traffic is the traffic you receive that comes from sites other than 
search engines. You might receive traffic from social media sites like 
Facebook, Twitter, or StumbleUpon (www.stumbleupon.com). Or you might 
receive traffic from other blogs or websites that link to you.
By looking at the places where your traffic comes from (and doesn’t come 
from), you can make navigation design decisions that help meet your goals. 
To take a peek at your referral traffic, follow these steps:
	
1.	Visit your Google Analytics dashboard (https://www.google.com/
analytics/web) and log in.
	
	 If you have more than one blog, select the blog you want to look at.
	
2.	From the left-side menu, choose Traffic Sources➪Sources➪Referrals.
	
	This brings up the top ten sites that bring traffic to you, as shown in 
Figure 5-7. At the bottom of the page, open the Show Rows drop-down 
menu and choose 50 to get a more complete picture.
	
3.	Go one level deeper by clicking the Performance button (refer to 
Figure 5-4) and choosing Bounces from the right column drop-down 
menu.
	
	 Now you can more easily spot problem areas in your blog’s navigation 
design.
Figure 5-6: Banner in my sidebar.

73
 Chapter 5: Gathering Design Ideas
Show Rows drop-down menu
Figure 5-7: Referral traffic for this blog shows that Pinterest and Facebook dominate.
You can glean so much from this information! Here are some helpful things 
you can learn from your data:
	
✓	Top social media sites for referral traffic: For whichever sites bring you 
the most traffic, make sure you have those corresponding social media 
sharing buttons in a visible spot on your blog. (That is, the buttons that 
allow readers to share a blog post or page on a social media network.) 
You may even decide to add a widget to your sidebar or footer that 
showcases your content on one of those platforms (like how a Facebook 
widget allows visitors to Like your page without having to go to your 
actual business page).
	
	My analytics (see Figure 5-7) show that Pinterest generates some of the 
best traffic for my blog, so I might decide to a create special page that 
features my most pinnable blog posts. The page would enable visitors to 
pin my content to their Pinterest boards easily.
	
✓	Areas to encourage navigation deeper into your site: If you click any 
of the referral sites, you can often glean even more information. For 
example, view the most popular posts that attracted Twitter users to 
your site. Or see which pins from Pinterest brought you the most traffic. 
Although not all the referral data is that helpful, you can use this infor­
mation to determine whether you should add custom messages to posts 
or add more links to other relevant posts.
	
✓	Opportunities to grow your social media network: If certain pages attract 
a high percentage of new visitors, they likely came from someone else 
sharing a blog post of yours. If these visitors are new to your blog, they 
probably aren’t followers or fans . . . yet. You could add an additional 
message to these pages to capture them as new followers.

Part II: Choosing the Visual Design Elements 
	
If you’re trying to increase your presence on a social media platform but your 
efforts aren’t generating much traffic yet, look at your blog design to see 
ways you can incorporate that platform more (sharing buttons, widgets, and 
so on).
Studying In-Page Analytics to 
see how users navigate
One of the coolest features of Google Analytics is the In-Page Analytics. This 
feature lays data over your actual blog design to give you a nice visual repre­
sentation of where people click within your site.
To take a look at the In-Page Analytics, follow these steps:
	
1.	Visit your Google Analytics dashboard (https://www.google.com/
analytics/web) and log in.
	
	 If you have more than one blog, select the blog you want to see.
	
2.	From the left-side menu, choose Content➪In-Page Analytics.
	
	This is where the magic happens! Your home page appears, as shown in 
Figure 5-8. The default view overlays your home page with bubbles con­
taining percentages that note what percentage of visitors clicked on each 
element. Scroll down the page to see the clicks for your entire page.
Show Color button
Figure 5-8: In-Page Analytics overlays onto your blog.

75
 Chapter 5: Gathering Design Ideas
	
3.	To see how many clicks a certain design element received, move your 
mouse over the bubble.
	
	 This shows you the actual number of clicks as well as the destination link.
	
4.	(Optional) Click the Show Color button to see the data represented in 
colors.
	
	 Unless you deselect Show Bubbles, you’ll see both the percentages and 
the colors.
By looking at the In-Page Analytics, you see what’s relevant to your current 
blog visitors and can look for missed opportunities. In-Page Analytics high­
lights opportunities to do the following:
	
✓	Tweak your navigation menu. Do you wish visitors were clicking certain 
tabs in your navigation menu more often? Perhaps a new page name or 
rearranging the order of your tabs would encourage more visitors to click 
the tab. If you have drop-down menus for some tabs, perhaps one of those 
pages should be featured more prominently in the navigation menu.
	
✓	Rearrange elements in your layout. Look at the items receiving the 
most and fewest clicks. Does that fit with what you were hoping? For 
example, if a button to your e-book receives fewer clicks than a less 
important button, you might decide to move your e-book button to 
another section of your sidebar. You may even decide the e-book button 
doesn’t stand out enough, leading you to entirely redesign the button.
	
✓	Highlight low-traffic but important pages. If key pages aren’t attracting 
the number of visitors that you hoped for, look for opportunities within 
the rest of your site to drive traffic to these key pages. For example, if 
you offer consulting services but your Services page doesn’t receive 
many clicks, you might decide to add a button on your sidebar or link to 
the page from your About page.
	
Don’t just stop at your home page! Your blog is completely clickable within In-
Page Analytics. Click any element on your home page to visit that page on your 
blog to find similar opportunities for improving your design and navigation.
Deciding Who Designs Your Blog
By cracking open this book, you obviously have a little bit of the do-it-yourself 
spirit. When it comes to designing your blog, you may find that you can do 
lots of things yourself, like adding a plug-in to WordPress or a widget to 
Blogger. But when it comes to putting together a comprehensive blog design, 
do you want to take on a little, a lot, or nothing at all?

76
Part II: Choosing the Visual Design Elements 
Luckily, there’s more than one way to design your blog. In this section, I 
cover benefits and challenges for each option so you can make a choice that 
suits your needs.
Hiring a designer
If you don’t have the time or inclination to design a blog yourself, hire some­
one to do the work for you! Hiring a designer costs money, but you can often 
find a designer whose rates are within your budget and who fits your style. 
Having a blog professionally designed can cost anywhere from a few hundred 
dollars to $5,000 or more. The range in cost is sort of like pricing a vacation. 
When you plan a vacation, your costs will depend on where you want to go, 
where you stay, and how much you want to do. Blog design can also range 
in price, depending on which blog platform you want, the designer’s experi­
ence, and how comprehensive of a design you want.
Hiring a designer or design firm to create your blog designs has both its 
benefits and challenges.
Benefits of working with a blog designer
When you work with a blog designer, you
	
✓	Get exactly what you want. When you work with a good designer, you 
don’t have to settle for blog design that’s limited because you don’t 
know how to do something technical. You get what you want without 
needing the knowledge to accomplish it.
	
✓	Exercise creative power. Good designers can translate your blog vision 
and your passions into a blog design that’s just for you. They can also 
help you weed out the blog elements you don’t really need or suggest 
creative ways to solve your design or layout challenges. For example, 
Catherine Horgan from Closet of Style (www.closetofstyle.com) 
loves layers. She loves to layer clothes and mood boards as well. After 
a design discovery meeting with designer Laurie Smithwick of LEAP 
Design, she ended up with a site that matches her passions, as shown in 
Figure 5-9.
	
✓	Receive support. A designer can also handle the really technical stuff, 
like making sure your blog looks the same in Internet Explorer as it does 
in Google Chrome. Plus, after your blog design is installed, a designer 
works with you to iron out any kinks or technical issues with your new 
design. If you need help troubleshooting or help with blog maintenance, 
many designers offer blog maintenance packages or charge by the hour. 
You always have someone to help you out of a bind.

Challenges of working with a blog designer
And here are the challenges:
	
✓	Cost: Yes, you have to fork over some dough to have someone design a 
custom blog for you. Although many designers offer special design pack­
ages, you may end up having to add on extra design elements to fit your 
needs.

78
Part II: Choosing the Visual Design Elements 
	
	Some designers offer premade designs, which are typically sold with just 
minimal change options, such as customizing the design with your blog 
name or choosing which social media buttons to include. Although you 
run a risk that others in your niche will have the same design, you can 
get a professional design for a lower cost.
	
✓	Dependence on designer: If you hire someone else to design your site, 
you won’t learn as much about how to use your blog as you would 
designing it yourself.
	
✓	Designer mismatch: Perhaps the designer’s style doesn’t match yours, 
or the designer just isn’t pleasant to work with. Depending on your 
contract, you may need to pay more creative fees for additional design 
options. See the sidebar “Questions to ask a blog designer” for some tips 
on selecting the right designer.
Questions to ask a blog designer
Not all designers are created equal. I asked 
Laurie Smithwick, founder of LEAP Design and 
co-founder of Kirtsy, to share a few questions 
to ask a blog designer or agency to ensure you 
hire someone right for you.
1. May I see some samples of your work?
You should never hire anyone whose work you 
haven’t seen or whose work you don’t love. 
Some designers will have an online portfolio, 
and others may send you a list of links. Either 
way is fine as long as there is enough work 
shown for you to develop a good sense of the 
designer’s style and decide whether you like 
it. (Assume that the job the designer does for 
you will look very much like his or her previ­
ous work.) A designer’s portfolio will also give 
you a sense of how long he or she has been in 
business. You don’t want to be someone’s first 
or second job — look for someone who’s been 
designing websites for several years.
2. Will you provide me with references? Or, 
may I call some of your clients for a reference?
Be sure to speak with a few of the designer’s 
past (or current) clients to see what working 
with the designer is like. Pay close attention to 
what these references say. You can assume 
that the way the designer treated other clients 
is how you’ll be treated. You want to be sure 
that the designer you hire does everything he 
or she promises to do and follows the timeline 
you both agreed to. Ask references about the 
designer’s attitude toward clients: Is it respect­
ful and inclusive, or disparaging and defensive?
3. What content management system(s) do you 
use?
A content management system (CMS) helps an 
administrator (ideally, you) update and manage 
your site without having to write any code. 
This means you can easily make changes, or 
add images, pages, or posts to your site using 
a simple WYSIWYG dashboard. WordPress, 
Drupal, and Joomla! are three of the most com­
monly used CMSes. Do not hire a designer 
that wants you to use their custom-made CMS 
because you’ll get locked into working exclu­
sively with that designer. If you use a more 
mainstream CMS, you’ll never have trouble 
finding someone who can work with what you 
already have — even if you stop working with 
the designer who built your site.
4. Who will own the images, content, and code 
when the job is done?

79
 Chapter 5: Gathering Design Ideas
Purchasing a predesigned theme or template
If you don’t want to hire someone to design your blog but don’t quite want 
to do it yourself either, a predesigned template might be the perfect middle 
road because you don’t have to know a lot about the technical side of blog 
design. Predesigned templates widely vary from great designs to not-so-great 
ones. With the knowledge you can glean from this book, you can likely create 
a blog design that you’re happy with.
Of course, purchasing a predesigned theme or template has both benefits 
and challenges.
When you opt for a predesigned theme or template, you benefit from the 
following:
	
✓	Fast set-up: With predesigned templates, you can get your new blog 
design up and running faster than having someone else do it for you (or 
doing it all yourself). The base design is already complete, ready for you 
to customize it.
Ideally, you should seek to hire a designer who 
will design your site and deliver it to you as a 
complete package when the job is done. Stay 
away from designers and firms who want to 
lock you into an ongoing hosting account with 
them. You should own your domain name as 
well as your hosting account. You should also 
have access to the hosting account, the server, 
and the CMS administration. If you don’t under­
stand what any of these things mean, do a quick 
bit of research to develop a basic knowledge. 
Don’t hire any designer who tells you that they 
own your code — you’re buying a website 
design, not renting it.
5. How do you price your services?
Web design prices can vary wildly, depending on 
the size of your site, the amount of time involved 
in designing and building it, the level of experi­
ence of the designer or design firm, and other fac­
tors. Some designers may offer a flat rate, while 
others may price on more of an à la carte basis. 
Some bill by the project, and others charge by the 
hour. Make sure you know all the details of your 
designer’s pricing structure so there are no sur­
prises when it’s time to pay the bill.
6. Can you develop a version of my site for 
mobile devices? Or, alternatively, will you be 
using a responsive design?
Mobile versions of sites are becoming de rigueur 
now because so many people access the web 
through their phones and tablets. Ask your 
designer whether a mobile site is part of the basic 
design package or costs extra. Alternatively, 
ask whether your designer is using responsive 
design — that your site automatically adjusts 
in size from a large monitor down to a standard 
phone screen.
7. What kind of tech support do you offer, and 
for how long?
Your designer should be willing to fix any coding 
or layout issues discovered within the first month 
or so without charge. (This does not include 
changes or additions to the original scope.) Find 
out what they offer in terms of maintenance and 
web development for the long term, after that ini­
tial grace period has ended. You want to know 
how to price these additional services, and also 
what turnaround time will be for individual main­
tenance requests. Ideally, you don’t want to have 
to wait longer than two days for fixes.

80
Part II: Choosing the Visual Design Elements 
	
✓	Customization capabilities: Just about every predesigned template 
allows you to tweak design elements, such as color, layout, and fonts. In 
Figure 5-10, the WordPress predesigned blog template from Templatic 
(http://templatic.com) is for someone who wants to highlight an 
e-book and blog about their topic. To make changes to the design and 
content, you simply add images and make content changes within your 
theme. In Figure 5-11, you can see that simply modifying this text will 
change the first feature box to your content. 
	
✓	Inexpensive yet still professional look and feel: A predesigned theme 
or template still gives you a blog design that looks professional but at a 
lower cost (because it isn’t customized by someone just for you).
Figure 5-10: Perhaps start with a predesigned template for WordPress.
The downsides of a predesigned theme or template include the following:
	
✓	Not as unique: Although you can indeed customize a predesigned tem­
plate to an extent, your blog design won’t be as unique as one that’s 
made by you or a designer. Ensure upfront that you can tweak the 
design enough so that your blog won’t look generic.
	
✓	Limitations in customization: Many templates do offer some flexibility 
in design, but you may be stuck with the general layout or the location 
of a certain design element. Some templates are more customizable than 
others, though, so check the features for the template before purchasing it.

81
 Chapter 5: Gathering Design Ideas
Designing it yourself
If you have a passion for learning 
new things and don’t mind experi­
menting, try designing your blog 
yourself. Of course, your reasoning 
could be less adventurous — say, 
you might just not have the funds 
right now to pay someone else to 
design your blog. Regardless the 
reason, designing your own blog can 
be rewarding!
When you get stuck, my best tip is 
to research your way to the answer. 
You’re definitely not the only one 
who’s ever designed their own 
blog. The Internet is full of tutorials, 
forums, and videos that can teach you how to do something. Between this 
book and the Internet, you could teach yourself many, many things about 
design. Bloggers who design their own blogs themselves typically work on 
blog frameworks like Genesis (which I go over in Chapter 7) or add custom­
ization to predesigned templates that offer a lot of flexibility.
Digging into designing your blog has some benefits and challenges.
Benefits of designing your own blog
Here’s the good news if you go on your own:
	
✓	Lower cost: Creating your own blog design is budget friendly. You might 
spend some money on imagery, a special plug-in, or a theme to serve as 
the shell of your design, but those outlays are far less than what you’d 
pay to hire someone.
	
✓	New skills: Design programs, HTML, and CSS may be unfamiliar to you 
when you start, but as you work through your design, you learn new skills 
that allow you to make your own changes to your blog whenever you 
want. Blogger Laura Tremaine rolled up her sleeves to design her own 
blog, Hollywood Housewife (http://www.hollywoodhousewife.com), 
as shown in Figure 5-12.
	
✓	Fits your style: No one has a better sense of your tastes than you! You 
don’t have to worry about finding the perfect premade theme or working 
with a designer who can’t quite nail the look and feel you’re after.
Figure 5-11: Use template customization 
options.

Challenges of designing your own blog
On the other hand:
	
✓	Takes time to learn: Heading into unknown territory can be exciting, but 
you’ll undoubtedly spend many, many hours designing your own blog. 
Something that takes a professional designer two minutes to complete 
may take you longer if you have to learn how to do it.
	
✓	Lack of technical assistance: Certain coding mistakes can cause other 
areas of your sites to not work — or worse, can crash your blog. In 
addition, small tweaks to your site can be time consuming.
	
✓	May not get exactly what you want: You may have a cool idea for your 
design but not know how to create it. While searching online for a tutorial 
can often work, you may find certain ideas just go beyond your current 
abilities.
	
If you design your own blog but get stuck with something, you can always 
hire someone just to create a single design element.

Selecting Fonts and Colors
In This Chapter
▶	Understanding what fonts say about your blog
▶	Selecting fonts that don’t clash
▶	Choosing colors that fit your brand
▶	Seeing what colors mean
▶	Finding places for color ideas and fonts
B

right shades, moody tones, punchy fonts — when it comes to designing 
your blog, selecting fonts and colors often becomes the most fun part 
of design. Different fonts have different personalities, and each shade of color 
can imply different things. This chapter guides you through making the best 
choices of fonts and color for your blog design.
If you already have a blog, you can read this chapter from the perspective of 
deciding whether to change your existing colors and fonts. If you’re starting 
a new blog or completely redesigning your blog, this chapter can help you 
select colors and fonts that match your personality and blog content.
	
Colors and fonts communicate a lot about your blog’s brand and make an 
impression on your readers, so you have to get these right.
So keep reading to see how to find the perfect fonts for your blog and select 
ones that don’t clash. I also give you a crash course on the color wheel, what 
colors mean, and how to effectively use color throughout your blog design.
Choosing Fonts
Ah, fonts. They’re swirly, scripty, scribbly, and full of personality. The fonts 
you use talk for you, becoming an extension of your brand and setting the 
tone for your words.

84
Part II: Choosing the Visual Design Elements 
When you look at your overall blog design, you work with two different kinds 
of text:
	
✓	Content text: You can identify this text on a blog because it can be high­
lighted with your cursor. Think blog post titles, headings, and content as 
well as text in your navigation menu and elements such as bylines and 
blog post comments. You control the fonts for this text within your cas­
cading style sheet (CSS), which I talk about in more detail in Chapter 9.
	
✓	Graphical text: This kind of text is a part of an image, such as a blog logo 
image, header, or other graphical element created in a photo-editing or 
graphics program (like Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator).
In these next few sections, I walk you through things to consider when select­
ing fonts for your blog design. Before we get to the details, though, you should 
understand the four common types of fonts, which I describe in Table 6-1.
Table 6-1	
Common Font Types
Font Type
Definition
Typical Use
Serif
Has lines or hooks 
(serifs) extending 
from parts of a letter.
Commonly used in print publications. 
Some serif fonts can be harder to 
read on-screen but can still be used 
effectively.
Sans serif
No lines or hooks.
Web content, especially paragraphs 
of text, is most readable in a sans 
serif font.
Decorative
Includes script, hand­
written, or novelty 
type fonts.
Good option for graphical text within 
a blog design. Not a good choice for 
blog post content.
Monospace
All letters and numbers 
take up the same width 
(like typewriter keys 
being the same size).
Best for displaying computer program­
ming code or to replicate typewritten 
text.
In Figure 6-1, you can see examples of these four font types. Check out the dif­
ferences between serif and sans serif for the capital T or a lowercase i. 

85
 Chapter 6: Selecting Fonts and Colors
Figure 6-1: Examples of the four main types of fonts.
Exploring what fonts say about your blog
Just like people, every font has its own personality. Some fonts are serious, 
some are whimsical, and some just scream boldness. The ones you choose 
for your blog design should mirror your blog’s own voice and personality. 
Allow your font to help set the mood for your blog’s content. You have so 
many fonts to choose from that deciding which ones fit your blog design is 
no easy feat.
	
Just because you like a font doesn’t mean it’s the right font for your blog 
design. Text on your blog — say, your blog name or a sidebar heading — 
makes different impressions on your reader, depending on the font you use. 
For example, a travel blog that uses a more conservative font may appear to 
focus on upscale vacations — or, conversely, could use a casual, handwritten 
font to appear to be more about family-friendly travels.
	
When selecting a font, consider the topics you write about and the voice and 
tone in your writing. Say you blog about social media. Well, that alone doesn’t 
help you when selecting a font. What voice do you write in? What angle do you 
take? Nuances like these can help you better choose a complementary font.
Or, say you blog about a serious topic with a serious tone. In that case, you 
don’t want to choose a whimsical, swirly font. However, if your topic is a seri­
ous one but you take a different approach — such as an inspirational journey 
through a battle with illness — then perhaps a swirly font fits.
In Figure 6-2, check out the font choices of The Art of Manliness (http://
artofmanliness.com) blog. The font choices have an old-timey, vintage 
feel that harkens back to a time long before computers. A modern font wouldn’t 
have fit with the tagline (Reviving the lost art of manliness) or tone of this 
blog. (For more on taglines, see Chapter 8.)

86
Part II: Choosing the Visual Design Elements 
© artofmanliness.com
Figure 6-2: The fonts used in this header tell you about the blog’s personality.
	
If you’re having a hard time figuring out which fonts fit your blog (or even 
if you just want more possibilities), try this: Write down some words that 
describe your blog as a whole. Then look at the font style categories on any 
of the font providers I discuss in the upcoming section, “Finding fonts,” and 
match one of your words with one of the font style categories.
	
Also, look at all the characters and letters of a potential font. For example, 
if your blog name has an ampersand character (&), make sure you like that 
font’s ampersand before you choose it. On my blog Adventuroo, I fell in love 
with the font Cocktail Shaker. I really love the font’s lowercase letters but 
don’t care for the uppercase, so I decided to use the font only in lowercase in 
my blog design.
Choosing web-safe fonts
When you flip through a magazine, those fonts have essentially become 
images printed onto a page. And on the web, text within graphical elements 
(like a logo) work the same way. 
However, content text (which I define earlier under the section “Choosing 
Fonts”) is different. Online, from one computer to the next, content text — 
blog post titles and paragraphs within your blog posts, for example — can 
display differently.
How’s that again? Fonts don’t necessarily look the same on all computers? 
What’s with that? The reason is that my computer might not have the same 
fonts installed that your computer has. If you purchase and install a font that 
I don’t have and then use that font in your blog design, your blog font may 
look great on your computer but be replaced with a monospace font on mine. 
All computers come with a small selection of web-safe fonts, and these fonts 
are safe to use for your content text. If you don’t want to explore font embed­
ding (which I explain in a moment), then sticking with common web-safe 
fonts such as the following ones can ensure your blog looks consistent across 
computers and other devices:

87
 Chapter 6: Selecting Fonts and Colors
	
✓	Arial
	
✓	Courier
	
✓	Georgia
	
✓	Times New Roman
	
✓	Trebuchet MS
	
✓	Verdana
Expanding your options with embedded fonts
At one point, live text was limited to using web-safe fonts. Luckily, you now 
have many more interesting choices regarding fonts, thanks to font-embed­
ding technology, which enables you to embed a font into your blog’s web 
pages. With an embedded font, visitors see the font you selected for your 
design, even if that font isn’t web-safe. 
So what’s the catch? Embedded fonts can slow the download of your blog 
in a visitor’s browser. Also, for embedded fonts to work, your visitors’ web 
browsers must support font-embedding.
When it comes to fonts, a browser knows what font to display by the font name 
listed in your CSS (Cascading Style Sheet). With a web-safe font (Figure 6-3), a 
browser displays the font correctly by pulling that font’s information from a 
computer’s operating system. With an embedded font, a browser displays the 
font correctly because that website’s CSS defines where a browser can find 
the font files it needs to display (since the font isn’t on the website visitor’s 
computer).
Figure 6-3: Web-safe fonts in Google.

88
Part II: Choosing the Visual Design Elements 
Services like Adobe Typekit (https://typekit.com) and Google Web 
Fonts (www.google.com/webfonts) host the fonts for you. When someone 
visits your blog, your CSS knows to display an embedded font by pulling the 
font files from another location besides your computer. 
To use embedded fonts with one of these services, they provide you with 
the code you need to make a font display on your blog. Nice! From there, 
you need to be able to add the code they provide to your blog’s HTML docu­
ment, usually in a file called header.php on WordPress or by editing your 
template file in Blogger. You also need to be able to alter your CSS in order to 
change from your current fonts to the names of the fonts you want to embed. 
I cover modifying CSS to change your fonts in Chapter 9.
	
A more advanced way to use embedded fonts is to use the @font-face 
property within your CSS. To do this, you need to be familiar enough with 
coding to either code it manually or use a service like FontSquirrel, which 
helps you generate the code and files needed to use the @font-face prop­
erty. The font files can either be hosted on your own server or with a font 
service like FontSquirrel. For more about @font-face, start with this article 
about embedding fonts at Dummies.com: www.dummies.com/how-to/
content/enhance-your-site-with-custom-fonts.html 
Knowing which fonts to avoid
Just like anything creative, telling you which fonts to avoid is mainly a matter 
of opinion. After all, someone out there uses those fonts for a reason. So 
instead of telling you, “This font is bad, and that font is ugly,” I want to share 
some reasons why you should avoid certain fonts or types of fonts:
	
✓	To begin, avoid opting for an 
overused font. Comic Sans, 
Papyrus, and Brush Script are 
three culprits (and some of the 
most loathed fonts out there, 
too); see Figure 6-4. These fonts 
scream, “Amateur!” and do little 
to set your blog design apart 
from other blogs in your niche. 
I consider these the three fonts 
to avoid at all costs!
	
✓	Be wary of using fonts that are 
illegible. Sure, that may sound 
funny — after all, you’d think 
that a font’s purpose is to be easily readable. However, some fonts have 
so many flourishes or so much of a distortion effect that certain words 
become hard to read.
Figure 6-4: Avoid using these fonts.

89
 Chapter 6: Selecting Fonts and Colors
Finding fonts
With so many places on the web to find fonts, it can be hard to find the best 
sites. In addition to Google Web Fonts (www.google.com/webfonts), the 
following lists point you to some of my favorite places to look for fonts, free 
or for-fee.
As you go on your font-finding quest, you need to be familiar with font 
licenses. Font licenses dictate how you can and can’t use a particular font. 
You’ll commonly see fonts listed as personal use, commercial use, or both. 
Generally speaking, here’s what these terms mean:
	
✓	Personal use refers to usage that isn’t meant to make a profit, such as 
using a font on a personal blog (that doesn’t generate income) or using a 
font to create an invitation for your child’s birthday party. 
	
✓	Commercial use refers to usage where a company or individual may 
profit either directly or indirectly from the font’s usage. For example, 
a person who designs blogs for a living directly profits from a font 
that they use within a blog design they sell to a client. As an indirect 
example, because I earn money on my blog through advertising, online 
courses, and e-books, I am indirectly profiting from a font’s usage on my 
blog. Therefore, I need a font with a commercial license.
	
While I provided a general overview in font licensing, each font website 
varies in how it categorizes fonts for use. Always read the font license before 
you download or purchase a font. 
Free fonts
The following are my favorite resources that offer free fonts:
	
✓	dafont.com: (www.dafont.com) dafont is definitely one of the most 
popular free sites for fonts. At the top of the dafont home page, you can 
find many categories and subcategories of fonts to choose from — more 
than 18,000 fonts available for download as of this writing.
	
✓	FontSpace: (www.fontspace.com) Browse examples of the most popu­
lar fonts, new fonts, and new designers. Fonts are clearly marked for 
personal or commercial use, or both.
	
✓	1001 Fonts: (www.1001fonts.com) This website offers more than 3,500 
fonts in a variety of categories.
	
✓	Font Squirrel: (www.fontsquirrel.com) All Font Squirrel fonts are 
free for commercial use, and Font Squirrel offers some of the best qual­
ity free fonts available. As you can see in Figure 6-5, the site is clean and 
easy to navigate.

For-fee fonts
With so many free fonts available, you may wonder why you should ever 
pony up money for a font. Although you can’t deny the attractiveness of 
“free,” and although the web is full of places to get free fonts, here are some 
benefits to paying for a font that you really like:
	
✓	Originality: Many bloggers never pay for a font. So, purchasing a mod­
estly priced font means that fewer designers will likely have it, and fewer 
readers will likely have seen it. That raises your professional and cool 
factors.
	
✓	Full character set: Free fonts come with all letters of the alphabet and all 
numbers, but don’t always have additional characters you might need 
(such as accented letters) or punctuation (such as quotation marks). 
Check the character set in the font’s profile before downloading or 
purchasing.
	
✓	Well-kerned characters: Without proper kerning (spacing between char­
acters), some letters might look too far from another, like a capital W 
beside a capital A, or run together, such as “rn” looking like an m. Fonts 
that you purchase often have better kerning than a free font.
If you’d like to check out fonts available for a fee, I suggest you start your 
search at the following websites:

91
 Chapter 6: Selecting Fonts and Colors
	
✓	Typekit: (https://typekit.com) Using one font can be free. Typekit, 
by Adobe, is a popular way to use great-looking web-safe fonts in your 
blog design. 
	
✓	Fontspring: (www.fontspring.com) Fontspring makes it easy to find 
high-quality fonts, some of which are free. This site is a great resource if 
you’re looking for fonts to use in both graphic text and content text on 
your blog. 
	
✓	MyFonts: (www.myfonts.com) This site offers more than 100,000 fonts 
to choose from (not that you’d look at that many). MyFonts is also the 
home of the fun and helpful WhatTheFont, where you can upload an 
image or enter a URL, and the site tries to find the closest match in its 
database.
	
✓	Fonts.com: (www.fonts.com) Fonts.com has more than 150,000 fonts, 
which covers just about everything you can think of. The site highlights 
best-selling fonts and also offers a list of the top 100 fonts. Fonts.com also 
has a font-identifying tool that walks you through a series of questions 
when you need to find the name of a font.
	
✓	Veer: (www.veer.com) Veer offers a wide variety of fonts (and images 
too). Just be aware that the licenses for these fonts covers only graphical 
text, not content text.
	
At many of these sites, you can test how a font looks with your own words. 
In Figure 6-6, I’m testing how a blog name looks in a particular font with a 
particular color.
Figure 6-6: Test a font with your own words and custom color.

92
Part II: Choosing the Visual Design Elements 
Of course, you can also find many high-quality, professionally designed fonts 
at the free sites I mention in this chapter, Google Web Fonts or Font Squirrel.
	
Some fonts can give you sticker shock because sites often show font pack­
ages, which include entire font families. A font family comprises various 
styles and weights, such as italics, condensed, bold, and semi-bold. If there’s 
a font within a font family that you really like, you can often purchase a spe­
cific font versus the entire family to keep the cost lower.
Combining complementary fonts
A widely accepted design principle says that you shouldn’t use more than 
three fonts on a layout such as a blog design. Anything more makes a design 
look messy and hinders concentration. If you’ve ever received a flyer or 
newsletter with seven or eight completely different fonts, you probably found 
the lack of unity in the design made it hard to distinguish what parts were 
most important. And it was probably just hard to read in general!
But as you may have already discovered, simply combining any two or three 
fonts doesn’t always work because they can clash, look too similar, or just 
look “off.” Other times, two fonts look great together, and you can’t place 
just why. 
	
An understanding of how fonts contrast and complement each other can help 
dispel some of the mystery and guide your font selection. Typically, you can 
combine fonts by choosing two to three complementary fonts that contrast 
one another. To start, consider how you can find contrast among your fonts:
	
✓	Thickness: Is your font skinny or fat? Thicker fonts often look nice 
paired with thinner fonts. Many font families come in different thick­
nesses, often classified with names such as Light, Medium, Book, Bold, 
or Heavy. Consider those options, too, when pairing fonts.
	
	If you decide to use a very thin font, be sure to test the font’s legibility 
within your blog design. A thin font for main headings may be overshad­
owed by using a thicker font as body text. On the flip side, a thin font 
used for body text may disappear into the background if the font size is 
too small.
	
✓	Style: Earlier in this chapter, I talk about the four common types of 
fonts (serif, sans serif, decorative, and monospace). Try combining a 
serif with a sans serif font, or a scripty font with a typewriter font. Aside 
from these types of fonts, there are also so many other classifications of 
fonts, from grunge to retro, handwriting to calligraphic. The ways to pro­
vide contrast based on styles are endless. See Figure 6-7 for an example 
of an all caps font paired with a wider, slimmer font.

93
 Chapter 6: Selecting Fonts and Colors
Figure 6-7: Try pairing a thicker, all caps font with a wider, slimmer font.
	
✓	Height: Just as fonts can be thin or thick, they can also be short or tall. 
Some fonts often appear taller because they are condensed, meaning that 
the kerning is tight, which also provides contrast. Note how the all caps 
font in Figure 6-7 is taller than the font that’s mostly lowercase. Both the 
font sizes and the all caps versus mostly lowercase provide contrast in 
this font pairing.
In addition to looking at contrast, you can combine fonts that have something 
in common. For example, you might choose two fonts with tall letters but 
that are different styles. Or choose fonts within the same family, like pairing a 
bold and light version of the same font.
	
Fonts with too many similarities tend to conflict with one another, so be sure 
they don’t have too many things in common. No matter how you decide to 
combine fonts, the fonts you choose should have complementing personalities.
Aside from looking at a font’s style and personality, you can also get technical 
and look at the following:
	
✓	Letterform: Letterform is essentially a letter’s shape. Two fonts with similar 
letterforms often look good when paired together. Compare the letters 
a, g, and e to get the best sense of a font’s compatibility. For example, in 
Figure 6-7, the capital A in both fonts has the same letterform.
	
✓	x-height: x-height refers to the height from the baseline to the upper 
part of a lowercase character, such as an x (see Figure 6-8). Looking at 
x-height helps you determine fonts of similar proportions. Pairing fonts 
of similar proportions often look more uniform than fonts with different 
proportions. Plus, fonts with larger x-heights are typically easier to read 
so they are good for large blocks of text.
Figure 6-8: The font on the left has a larger x-height than the font on the right.

94
Part II: Choosing the Visual Design Elements 
Assigning roles to fonts
When you assign roles to your fonts, you help keep your blog design looking 
professional. Keeping your font’s purpose clear makes your blog navigation 
design more effective and your overall design easier on the eyes.
After you choose two or three complementary fonts that also have enough 
contrast to stand out from each other (see the preceding section), give the 
different fonts you choose specific roles in your design. To start, establish a 
visual hierarchy for the fonts. Think about the text elements you have within 
your blog design, such as the following:
	
✓	Blog name
	
✓	Tagline
	
✓	Navigation menu
	
✓	Blog post title
	
✓	Subheadings
	
✓	Blog post and page content
	
✓	Sidebar titles
	
✓	Footer headings
Each element should have a consistent look yet appear cohesive when look­
ing at your entire blog design. By giving each text element a specific look, you 
create a hierarchy that helps the reader scan your page and digest your con­
tent. With the two or three fonts you choose for your blog design, you can 
establish hierarchy in these text elements by using the following:
	
✓	Color: Color naturally attracts the eye, so colored text elements catch 
the most attention. For example, using a black blog post title with green 
text beneath would feel a little off because a reader’s eyes might pull to 
the green text, completely bypassing your post’s title.
	
	Save bolder colors for more important text elements to attract the most 
attention.
	
✓	Size: Larger font sizes denote more importance than smaller ones. This 
means your blog post titles need to be larger than your blog post con­
tent. On that same line of thought, subheadings with your blog posts 
should be smaller than your blog post titles but larger than your blog 
post content. 
	
✓	Weight: Use weights — for example, light, bold, and italics — to create 
hierarchy without adding more fonts to your design. More heavily 
weighted text elements carry more importance than lighter design ele­
ments, so keep this in mind, especially when considering your blog post 
titles and blog post content text.

95
 Chapter 6: Selecting Fonts and Colors
In the example shown in Figure 6-9, I 
chose three fonts. Here’s how I chose 
to apply each font in the design and 
how I created a hierarchy within 
each font grouping as well: 
	
✓	The graphic text is an unusual 
font that appears only on a few 
elements that remain pretty 
static within a blog’s design. 
(Use graphic text sparingly 
because search engines can’t 
read it and creating graphic text 
is more work than content text.) 
For the blog name, I used both 
size and color to emphasize the 
blog name’s importance in the 
design. I chose the same font for 
sidebar titles, to carry the font 
into other parts of the design, 
but the cool color and smaller size of the sidebar title font clarifies its 
relationship to the blog name. 
	
✓	For the navigation and blog post titles in particular, I needed a font that 
could display as content text but wanted the font and color to make 
these elements stand out in the design. To accomplish this, I used an 
embedded font and grouped all the heading-type elements together 
with this font, but created a hierarchy of relative importance among the 
headings by applying different sizes and colors. This embedded font still 
complements the graphical text in that they use the same letterform, as 
illustrated in the lowercase a.
	
✓	For the blog post and page content font, note that the font selection is 
much plainer than the blog name and heading fonts so that the main text 
is easy to read in large bodies of text. This font is also web-safe. With 
a similar x-height to the other two fonts, this font rounds out the font 
choices nicely. 
	
You don’t have to use all these formatting and design options. Just consider 
them as ways to give each text element a specific role within your blog 
design.
Choosing Colors
Colors matter, but don’t take my word for it. According to The Institute for 
Color Research, between 62 and 90 percent of a person’s assessment of an 
environment is based on color alone. Color can also improve readership by 
40 percent. I don’t know about you, but those stats got my attention.
Figure 6-9: Organize the two or three fonts in 
your design so that similar items are grouped 
together. Within each group, use size and 
color to create a hierarchy.

96
Part II: Choosing the Visual Design Elements 
So what colors jump to mind when you think about certain brands? How 
about UPS? Brown, of course. What about Coke? Red. Although you don’t 
have to employ a strong color association, colors can help you define your 
overall brand.
Colors can also help establish a tone, or mood, with your readers. If your 
writing style is punchy and humorous, then bright, vivid colors would work 
better with your blog design than somber colors like industrial gray or a pale 
blue. See the section “Exploring what colors mean” to learn how different 
colors evoke certain emotions.
These next sections give you a better understanding of colors and how to 
combine them on your blog design. I also share a way to determine which 
colors work best for your blog and then list some inspirational places to find 
colors galore. To change the color for different elements of your blog design, 
refer to Chapter 9 where I go over how to accomplish this by modifying 
your CSS.
Getting to know the color wheel
Ah, our old friend, the color wheel, which is 
simply a circular diagram that shows relation­
ships between colors and serves as a tool to help 
you understand why certain colors work better 
together than others. See Figure 6-10.
A standard color wheel shows primary, second­
ary, and tertiary hues, which are the purest form 
of a color:
	
✓	Primary colors: You probably already know 
that red, yellow, and blue make up the three 
primary colors. All other colors stem from 
these three biggies. If you’re wondering why 
all the talk about RGB (red, green, blue) and 
not RYB in image editing and web design, 
see the next section.
	
✓	Secondary colors: These colors are combined by mixing primary 
colors: orange (red+yellow), green (yellow+blue), and purple or violet 
(red+blue).
	
✓	Tertiary colors: This third level of colors are created by mixing a pri­
mary color with a secondary color: red-orange, red-violet, yellow-orange, 
yellow-green, blue-violet, and blue-green.
Figure 6-10: A typical color 
wheel showing hues, tints, 
shades, and tones.

97
 Chapter 6: Selecting Fonts and Colors
If you were to go a deeper into a color wheel (or play with a color picker 
online or in an image-editing program), you would see these variations of 
each hue:
	
✓	Tint: A hue made lighter by adding white
	
✓	Shade: A hue made darker by adding black
	
✓	Tone: A hue mixed with gray
Defining RGB and hex codes
If all colors come from red, yellow, and blue, you might be wondering why we 
often look at onscreen colors in terms of RGB and hex (short for hexadecimal) 
colors.
RGB is a three-color additive color model used for light-based devices, such 
as TVs, computer screens, and digital cameras. Pixels on backlit screens are 
dark until you add various levels of red, green, and blue light, which create 
an array of colors.
Hexadecimal numbers represent the red, green, and blue values with a six-
digit code that begins with a hash (#) symbol. The six-digit code is essentially 
broken down into three, two-digit values that use a mix of numbers and let­
ters. The lowest value given is 00 (meaning no light), and the highest is FF 
(meaning the highest amount of light). This makes sense when you think of two 
common hex codes you might see: #000000 (black) and #ffffff (white). 
So, when designing blogs, you use hexadecimal numbers (hex codes) to give 
certain design elements color values. I talk about changing colors of certain 
design elements in Chapter 9, but know that you can create more than 16 mil­
lion colors using hex codes! That means you definitely have lots of choices 
when it comes to colors for your blog design!
	
If you visit a website and love the colors, you can find out exactly what colors 
they are with ColorZilla (www.colorzilla.com), a free browser add-on for 
Chrome and Firefox.
Creating color harmony
Just as certain fonts go well together, so do certain colors. I’m sure you’ve 
seen a color scheme before and said, “Oh, that clashes!” And finding color 
harmony can be as simple as understanding one tool: the color wheel. After 
you understand how to create color harmony using the color wheel, creating 
color schemes for your blog design is much less of a mystery.

98
Part II: Choosing the Visual Design Elements 
Here are the basic schemes created using the color wheel as a tool (as shown 
in Figure 6-11):
	
✓	Analogous color scheme: Uses three or more colors that sit next to 
each other on the color wheel.
	
✓	Monochromatic color scheme: Uses tints, tones, and values within the 
same family.
	
✓	Triadic color scheme: Uses three colors that are evenly spaced around 
the color wheel.
	
✓	Square color scheme: Uses four colors evenly spaced around the color 
wheel.
	
✓	Complementary color scheme: Uses colors opposite of one another on 
the color wheel.
	
✓	Split complementary color scheme: Uses one color paired with two 
colors on both sides of that color’s direct complementary color.
	
✓	Tetrad (or rectangular) color scheme: Uses four colors arranged by two 
complementary pairs.
	
✓	Diad color scheme: Uses two colors that are two colors apart on the 
color wheel, with one color skipped in between.
Figure 6-11: Different methods of creating color schemes.

99
 Chapter 6: Selecting Fonts and Colors
In the everyday world, we may not talk about tetrad or diad color schemes, 
but most folks can relate to warm and cool colors. Looking at the color wheel 
again, you can see how the colors are divided into warm and cool (refer to 
Figure 6-10):
	
✓	Warm: Red, orange, yellow, and variations of those colors
	
✓	Cool: Green, blue, purple, and variations of those colors
And not to complicate life, but you can also have “cooler” oranges or 
“warmer” purples. For example, a cool color can have red, orange, or yellow 
undertones, and a warm color can have green, blue, or purple undertones.
	
And here is why color choice matters: Both warm and cool colors can evoke 
both positive or negative emotions. Warmer colors can evoke a sense of any­
thing from coziness and happiness (sunny yellow) to anger and aggression 
(blood red). Cooler colors can bring a sense of calmness and relaxation (sky 
blue) or can feel indifferent or subdued (steel gray).
Finding color inspiration
Colors, colors everywhere! With the color wheel as your foundation and 
guide, peruse the web for color inspiration. Many places offer colors and 
color schemes that you can use as-is or let them serve as a jumping point 
into creating your own color combinations.
	
✓	Kuler: (https://kuler.adobe.com) Kuler, shown in Figure 6-12, has 
long been one of my favorite sites for color combo inspirations. Create 
your own color swatch or choose one submitted by the community. 
The site showcases five-swatch color palettes that you can search by 
keyword, such as “nature” or “bold.” You can even download these 
color palettes and open them up in Adobe programs like Photoshop and 
Illustrator. It’s magical.
	
✓	COLOURlovers: (www.colourlovers.com) This community-based site 
allows users to create and share color palettes from all over the world. 
Here, you can also find paid color tools (such as ColorSchemer) to build 
color schemes, or you can design a seamless pattern (for free using 
Seamless Lite, or the paid version Seamless Studio).
	
✓	Design Seeds: (www.design-seeds.com) Jessica from Design Seeds 
has many years of experience as a color specialist, and it shows. She 
starts with a photograph and then creates a custom color palette based 
on the photo (without using an eyedropper tool that merely pulls a 
color from a photo). Her talent is impressive, and this site is serious eye 
candy. Each palette includes the hex codes so you can use a palette in 
your own blog design.

Figure 6-12: At Kuler, explore color swatches or build your own.
	
✓	Pantone: (www.pantone.com) Pantone is the authority on color. Sift 
through their top colors, the color of the year, and seasonal colors to 
find some cool ones that fit your blog.
	
✓	ColorCombos: (www.colorcombos.com) The ColorCombos site pro­
vides articles on color, color combination palettes, and tools like the 
Color Tester tool, which lets you play around with color combinations.
	
You can find color inspiration from everyday things all around you: nature, 
products or displays in a store, photos, everyday household items, food, 
paint swatches, and more. 
	
And if you have an iPhone or iPad, give the Palettes app a whirl (http://
itunes.apple.com/us/app/palettes). Create color schemes by pulling 
colors from a website or picture or add colors using one of five color models. 
Palettes comes in three offerings: Free, Basic, and Pro.
Exploring what colors mean
Colors evoke emotion. Colors have meanings that vary between cultures 
and even personal preference. Of course, the shade of a color can change 
the meaning, too. For example, yellow might be cheerful, but a darker yellow 
might be considered dingy. An olive green can feel earthy, while a forest 
green can symbolize affluence.

101
 Chapter 6: Selecting Fonts and Colors
However, speaking in generalities, Table 6-2 gives you a sense of what some 
basic colors typically mean to Westerners.
Table 6-2	
Color Meanings
Color
Various Meanings
Red
Passion, love, energy, danger, strength, importance, powerful
Orange
Heat, endurance, vitality, health, inviting
Yellow
Happy, courage, energizing, pleasant, cheerful
Green

Blue
Loyalty, calming, truth, tranquility, responsibility
White
Innocence, purity, clean, sterile, light
Black
Elegance, power, death, grief, formal, authority
Brown
Earthliness, warm, dependability, wistful, woodsy
When selecting colors for your blog, take a pre-emptive stance and research 
the color’s meaning for any negative connotations that might relate to your 
topic. For example, if you have a food blog, steer clear of using a lot of blue. 
Some say that the color blue suppresses the appetite.
Deciding on colors to match your brand
The colors that visitors see when they land on your blog make a psychologi­
cal impact within seconds. Not only do humans unconsciously attach mean­
ing to certain colors, but visitors will also form instant impressions about 
your blog based on color.
This association happens so instantly you probably don’t realize it — but, 
colors can make or break your blog design. I’m sure you’ve been to a blog or 
website that immediately felt welcoming and cozy. Or perhaps you’ve been to 
a website with colors so loud and mismatched that you assumed the blog’s 
content would be horrible.
	
Colors also convey emotion and visually set the tone for your blog. In fact, 
your colors should help reinforce what your blog is about. For example, if 
you blog about a serious subject, you probably don’t want to use loud, fluo­
rescent colors. If your writing is hysterically funny, you don’t want subdued, 
muted colors.

102
Part II: Choosing the Visual Design Elements 
In Figure 6-13, notice how the blog Intimate Weddings (www.intimate
weddings.com) uses light colors to create an intimate setting. The blog 
wouldn’t give off the same vibe with a turquoise rather than a pale blue, or 
a bright orange rather than a softer, lighter orange.

Figure 6-13: The color choices for the Intimate Weddings blog complement the site’s content.
Deciding on the exact colors can seem like a fun yet overwhelming process. 
Start by looking at some of the places that I mention in the earlier section, 
“Finding color inspiration.” If you want to try creating a color scheme your­
self, follow these basic steps:
	
1.	Start with a basic color that inspires you.
	
	 It’s your blog, so you should like the colors, but also consider your audi­
ence. If you love hot pink but your blog is geared toward financial advi­
sors, you may want to start with another color that you love.
	
2.	Jot down the topic you write about and a few words that describe 
your blog’s voice and tone.
	
	 If you write about many topics, try to think as broadly as possible. See 
Chapter 3 if you need help defining voice and tone. Bringing these tidbits 
of information top-of-mind gets those creative juices flowing so you can 
choose a color that really fits your blog.

103
 Chapter 6: Selecting Fonts and Colors
	
3.	 Select a more specific color based on Steps 1 and 2 to narrow down 
your basic color to a hue, tint, shade, or tone that will be the most 
fitting.
	
	 Do bright colors fit your blog the best? Are pastels the way to go? 
Earthy?, rich?, warm?, cool?, and so on. Also remember to consider what 
certain colors mean.
	
4.	Finish your blog design’s color scheme by adding more colors.
	
	 See the earlier section, “Creating color harmony” for help with creating 
colors that look good together.
	
If you aren’t sure which color to start with, try this exercise a few times with 
a different starting color. You can then have a few color schemes to choose 
from.
Determining how many colors to use
You don’t just need to choose colors for your blog design: You also need to 
consider how many colors and how much of each color will appear in your 
design. You really don’t have to abide by any set rule for this, but the follow­
ing guidelines offer a good starting point: 
	
✓	Start with three colors. White and black typically don’t count toward 
your three-color palette. What I’m talking about here are the splashes 
of color that call attention to different parts of your blog to add visual 
appeal. Again, three isn’t a rule but a nice starting point. Many blogs 
(including my own) use five or six colors, and some use just one or two.
	
	If you decide to add colors beyond your initial three, combining them 
effectively becomes trickier. To use more color while still maintaining 
coherence among the colors in your design, try using tints, shades, and 
tones from one color.
	
✓	Apply colors using the 60-30-10 rule to create a harmonious design. 
The 60-30-10 rule stems from interior design but is often used by web 
designers to create a nice balance of color. Typically, the 60-30-10 rule 
means:
	
•	A primary color covers 60 percent of your design.
	
•	A secondary color covers 30 percent.
	
•	An accent color finishes the remaining 10 percent of your design.
	
	You don’t have to follow the 60-30-10 rule exactly. In fact, many bloggers 
modify this rule a bit, because their blog’s purpose is showcasing pho­
tography. (Food bloggers, travel bloggers, and of course photography 

104
Part II: Choosing the Visual Design Elements 
bloggers all come to mind.) On these blogs, the design is mostly white 
so that photos stand out and “design” colors don’t interfere with how 
the color photos are perceived. If your blog uses lots of photos or you 
simply want a white, airy design, you can still maintain the 60-30-10 
proportions among the colored elements. 
	
	A great example is the blog Oh My Veggies (http://ohmyveggies.com), 
shown in Figure 6-14. Kiersten’s blog uses a colorful palette of yellow, 
green, and orange without detracting from her mouth-watering food 
photos. The blog design still gives off a vibrant feel without being too 
heavy with color. Moreover, notice how the blog uses the three colors 
in different proportions, using mostly yellow, then green, and then just a 
few splashes of orange.
	
	The upshot: Vary the degree to which you use each color in your design. 
You don’t want all the colors to have equal weight.

from scratch. Whether you’re designing your blog for the first time or going 
through a redesign, creating your overall blog layout is like forming the 
skeleton that you then flesh out with your design and content.
This chapter walks you through building that skeleton and then some. In this 
chapter, I talk about blog layout types as well as choosing a theme or frame­
work that becomes the foundation for your blog design. I also discuss options 
for featuring content on your home page and show you ways to create blog 
post excerpts. In looking at your blog design as a whole, you need to consider 
how advertising affects your entire design, so I cover that, too.
Getting Familiar with Common Layout Types
Figuring out how to lay out your blog isn’t a cut-and-dried decision. Design is 
subjective. You might choose a blog design layout based on its functionality 
or just because you like how the layout looks. Deciding on a layout type makes 
choosing a blog theme or framework easier because you can immediately 
narrow down the theme choice (of course, you can change your mind). And 
although the layout types in this section are by no means a comprehensive 
list, they do give you a sense of the possibilities for your own blog design.

Part II: Choosing the Visual Design Elements 
Two-column right sidebar
Your standard, run-of-the-mill blog design displays your main content on the 
left side with a sidebar that goes along the right side of your blog. But blogs 
designed using this layout can be anything but run-of-the-mill. In Figure 7-1, 
The Nailasaurus uses a two-column layout, drawing attention to the main 
post with a large photo that you see before you scroll down further into the 
blog post. The font in the navigation menu also exists in the sidebar, and the 
clever social media nail icons reinforce what this blog is about. Together, 
these design elements unify the blog header, sidebar, and main column.

Figure 7-1: This blog uses a two-column layout.
Here is why this layout works well for blog design: 
	
✓	We read from left to right. Because English and most other languages 
move from left to right, this layout style makes your most important 
content (blog posts) the first thing someone sees to read. In fact, a study 
from the Nielsen Norman Group (www.nngroup.com) concluded that 
web users spend 69 percent of their time viewing the left side of the page. 

107
 Chapter 7: Developing Your Overall Blog Layout
	
✓	This layout is familiar to blog readers. Because this layout type is so 
popular, readers who frequently visit blogs are familiar with where to 
look for the blog post content and sidebar information.
Of course, using a blog layout that so many others choose can also make 
your blog harder to stand out in a sea of blogs. In addition, while using only 
one sidebar usually makes a blog design less cluttered, you have to be more 
selective as to what content to feature.
	
Split sections of your single sidebar into two parts if you need more space 
but don’t want to commit to two full sidebars.
Two-column left sidebar
The mirror image of the previous layout, this two-column blog design show­
cases your main blog content on the right side with a sidebar on the left. 
Opting for a sidebar on the right is definitely the more common choice in 
blogland, but using a left sidebar can still make an impact. In Figure 7-2, you 
see the blog The Two in Love (www.thetwoinlove.com) uses this layout 
style beautifully. This blog design starts off with a large blog name and photo 
that pull you down towards the navigation menu and social media buttons.

Figure 7-2: This layout features main content on the right side, drawing attention with large 
graphics like this gallery of images.

108
Part II: Choosing the Visual Design Elements 
Because we read left to right, content placed in a left sidebar often takes more 
prominence than content in a right sidebar. This makes a left sidebar a good 
place to have advertising or something important you want the reader to know 
or do. In addition, you want your main column to be especially attractive in 
order to draw the reader’s eye over to read a post. You can achieve this with 
good imagery and a blog post title style that uses a special font or color.
A blog design that uses a left sidebar does have some disadvantages. First, 
this layout type can negatively affect search engine optimization (SEO). 
Search engines scan content from left to right (just like how most humans 
do) and place more importance at what they scan first. You want search 
engines to read your main content first rather than something like naviga­
tional links or an advertisement.
	
You can get around the search engine disadvantage by ensuring that the 
HTML structure of your site places your main content first instead of after 
the left sidebar content. The good news is that many themes do this for you; 
otherwise, you have to adjust your CSS to implement this, which may not 
always be easy to implement. For an introduction to CSS, see Chapter 9.
Three-column right sidebars
Another common blog design layout type features a main column on the left with 
two sidebars on the right side. The blog grain edit (http://grainedit.com), 
shown in Figure 7-3, uses images to highlight featured posts and a gray box to 
draw attention to subscription options and social media links.
Many bloggers like having two right sidebars because more key sidebar 
content can appear toward the top of the page. However, with two sidebars, 
you can easily get carried away with heavy advertising, buttons, or widgets, 
making your design look junky and cluttered.
If you’d like the extra sidebar space that two sidebars offers, create a hier­
archy to avoid a cluttered design. Some bloggers merge the two columns at 
the top of the blog layout and separate the columns further down the page. 
In addition, group similar items within the same column. For example, don’t 
place some social media buttons in one column and a few more in the other. 
Place all the social media buttons together in the same column.
	
If you decide to go for a three-column layout with right sidebars, keep your 
sidebars a reasonable width so they don’t make your main column too narrow.

109
 Chapter 7: Developing Your Overall Blog Layout

Figure 7-3: This blog keeps the sidebars uncluttered and balanced.
Three-column with split sidebars
This layout also uses two sidebars, but the sidebars appear on either side of 
your main content area. Symmetrical design can sometimes come off as too 
static, but it can also provide balance and order to your blog layout. Figure 7-4 
shows the blog Olivine’s Charm School (http://olivinecharmschool.com), 
which features a beautiful three-column layout with split sidebars.
	
With sidebar content separated by a main column, one of the best ways to 
decide what content goes in which sidebar is to place key sidebar content 
in the left column, where your readers will look first. Olivine’s Charm School 
uses the left sidebar for navigation, instead of displaying the navigation 
across the top — a great example of keeping a three-column layout looking 
clean and organized, with important content in the left sidebar.
When working with a layout that splits up your sidebars, avoid making your 
sidebars so large that your main content feels squeezed in the middle. A 
narrow column for your main blog content hinders readability.

Figure 7-4: This design points you to the left column, which houses the 
navigation menu.
Magazine style
Magazine-style blog designs have two distinct calling cards: they rely on 
imagery and serve as a portal to your content.
This layout type often features small teasers of text with images. Sometimes, 
though, bloggers use only images with very little text. In Figure 7-5, you can 
see how the Parent Pretty blog (http://parentpretty.com) features a 
larger image as the star of the page and blog post teasers. After you click an 
image or blog post title, the full blog post opens.
	
For blogs that write about highly visual topics like fashion or travel, this 
layout type can work great. However, magazine styles also work well for 
bloggers who write about many different topics. Typical blog layouts put the 
most recent content at the top of the page, but magazine-style layouts give 

111
 Chapter 7: Developing Your Overall Blog Layout
readers to a chance to see blog 
post excerpts from different cat­
egories all at one time. When a 
reader clicks to read more, they 
are directed to a full blog post. 
When done well, this layout style 
helps readers easily scan a home 
page to find the topics they’re 
most interested in. The layout 
then directs readers to individ­
ual posts around those topics.
Magazine-style blogs also give 
bloggers a chance to break away 
from the typical left-column, 
right sidebar look on their home 
page. A magazine style layout 
can help a blog appear more like 
a large online publication (simi­
lar to a professional magazine) 
rather than a blog.
So what’s are the downsides of 
magazine-style blog layouts?
	
✓	They can easily become cluttered and overwhelming. To avoid this, 
consider the hierarchy and organization of your home page content. For 
example, Dear Crissy’s blog includes a post excerpt with a large photo 
to showcase the most current post. A comparatively large image tells 
visitors where to look first. Underneath this most recent post, other blog 
posts are organized by category to help readers navigate to the content 
that interests them most.
	
✓	If you feature four topics on your home page yet write about only one 
of those topics every six months, your home page can look outdated, 
which looks especially awkward if that post was time sensitive. 
	
✓	This layout asks readers to click to reach your a full blog post, versus 
having at least one full post on the home page.
Adaptable layouts for different devices
When working on your blog design, you might wonder what layout width 
your blog design should be. Lucky for you, blog theme developers handle 
that for you. Most blog themes adjust your blog layout to work with your 
visitors’ screen sizes by using either a fluid or responsive layout.

Figure 7-5: This design focuses on imagery to entice 
readers to click over from the magazine-style home 
page.

112
Part II: Choosing the Visual Design Elements 
A fluid layout is based on proportions so that blog elements take up the same 
percentage of space from one screen size to another. In essence, fluid layouts 
shrink or enlarge a layout design proportionally. 
A website with responsive design takes fluid layouts a step further by using 
queries that determine what device type the visitor is using. The website 
then presents a different layout based on that device. For example, a layout 
could be three columns on a computer screen but only two columns on a 
tablet. I cover responsive design a little more in Chapter 10.
	
Many developers create blog themes that fit the 960 Grid System, This grid 
system uses 960 pixels as a maximum width with portions of a design divided 
into 12 or 16 columns. With this grid system, your blog’s main content would 
fit within this width and then your background image or color would fill the 
sides to fit the width of the visitor’s screen resolution. You can learn more 
about how the grid system works at 960 Grid System (http://960.gs).
	
To see what your design looks like at different resolutions and even on differ­
ent devices, give Screenfly (http://quirktools.com/screenfly) a try.
Selecting a Blog Theme
One of the biggest decisions you make about your blog design is deciding 
which blog theme to choose. A blog theme is a collection of files — such as 
functions.php and style.css files — that work together to produce the 
functionality and design of your blog. Some themes adhere to a certain layout 
type, and others give you the flexibility to adjust the theme layout to reflect 
your preferences.
Overall, you choose a theme based on your blogging platform. (Your platform 
is the service or software that transforms the content you input into the blog 
format that your visitors see and use online.) Popular platforms range from 
free services that host your blog for you (such as WordPress.com, Blogger, and 
Tumblr) to more advanced options such as WordPress.org (which requires 
web development skills to set up and host yourself). The free options are 
easier to use but less flexible. The advanced options are more flexible but 
require web development skills. Regardless of your platform, your blog’s 
theme must work that platform and all the popular blogging platform’s offer 
a variety of themes you can choose from. 
These next few sections get you familiar with things to look at when picking 
out a theme, whether you should invest in a premium theme, and places to 
find themes. 

113
 Chapter 7: Developing Your Overall Blog Layout
Considering a theme’s flexibility
Not all blog themes are created equal. Some give you more design flexibility 
than others. Here are some things to consider when selecting a theme for 
your blog design:
	
✓	Overall design: Of course, how a blog theme looks should play a role 
in your decision. Thinking about the things you decide about your blog 
(see Chapter 3), ask yourself how well the design — before any custom­
izations — fits with your brand.
	
✓	Customization: Some themes enable you to make a lot of customizations 
in your design and functionality whereas others don’t. When deciding on 
a theme, understand what design changes (like a color scheme) you can 
make from the theme’s options. Also, pay extra attention to how much 
you can customize a header because this becomes the first part of your 
design a visitor sees.
	
	In Figure 7-6, you can see customization options (color scheme, link 
color, layout) for the WordPress theme Twenty Eleven, which is quite 
basic compared with some other themes.
	
✓	Layout options: In the beginning of this chapter, I share some common 
layout options. Some themes provide layout options, while others might 
keep to one style (like solely a magazine layout).
Figure 7-6: Some themes offer minimal choices.

114
Part II: Choosing the Visual Design Elements 
	
✓	Widget-ready: Widgets enable you to easily add content and features 
to your blog design, such as a category list and search box for readers 
to search your content. Nearly all themes allow you to use widgets (if 
a theme doesn’t, don’t use it), but some also offer custom widgets, like 
one that shows Recent Posts or an image gallery.
	
✓	Page templates: Some themes include multiple page templates that 
make it easy for you to create a full-size page with no sidebar or a page 
that showcases your images in a predesigned gallery.
	
✓	Cross-browser tested: Many themes are tested to ensure they work on 
all major browsers.
	
✓	Search engine optimization: Some themes are developed to make it 
easier for search engines to index your site. Also, some themes are built 
with a structure to ensure that important content precedes less impor­
tant content so search engines read your blog post content first. I cover 
search engine optimization more in Chapter 12.
	
✓	Date last updated: Before deciding on a theme, check to see the last 
time it was updated. Themes should stay current with the latest plat­
form releases.
	
✓	Responsive design: Responsive designs ensures your blog design 
looks great on all devices, whether someone is viewing your blog on 
their desktop, a tablet, or a mobile phone. Read more about responsive 
design in Chapter 10.
	
If you’re unsure about downloading or purchasing a particular theme, try 
doing an online search for “Theme Name + Review” to see whether anyone 
has written about their experiences with that theme.
Choosing between a free or premium theme
With blogs being so popular, blog themes have sprung up all over the web. 
Literally thousands of themes are available that might work for your blog 
design. Aside from a theme’s flexibility, one of the main factors in choosing a 
blog theme is, of course, the cost.
You can find many, many free and premium themes. Of course, a free theme 
is, well, free!, and you aren’t out any cash if you decide months down the 
road that you don’t like your theme. In addition, if you’re just starting out 
as a blogger and unsure whether blogging is for you in the long run, a free 
theme is probably the best solution for you.
Premium themes can range in price but offer many advantages:
	
✓	More customization options: Premium themes typically have more 
ways that you can customize your theme. You can often make changes 
without doing any coding by using the option panels shown in your 

115
 Chapter 7: Developing Your Overall Blog Layout
dashboard. As I mention in the previous section, some themes include 
custom widgets and page templates, too, like the Raffinade theme on 
Themeforest (see Figure 7-7) which costs about $35. The search box is 
customized to match the design and this theme also.
	
✓	Well-coded: Premium themes are more likely to have cleaner code 
under the hood of the design. A poorly coded theme can slow down 
your blog’s loading time and make it more difficult to interpret the code 
if you need to modify it. Sure, a free theme can most definitely be well 
coded, but developers of premium themes have more at stake because a 
poor-quality theme can hurt their reputation and affect sales.
	
	Sometimes a poorly coded free theme is a result of inexperience, but 
occasionally, a free theme has malicious code that can harm your blog. 
If you stick with the reputable theme sources I discuss in this chapter, 
you’re not likely to run into this problem. If you find a theme by doing a 
basic Google search, research the provider first to make sure others have 
worked with this provider for some time and its themes are worthwhile.
Figure 7-7: For a fee, premium themes offer a robust list of features.

116
Part II: Choosing the Visual Design Elements 
	
✓	Support: Nearly all premium themes offer some type of support for 
implementation or customization issues with a theme. Larger theme 
developers or framework creators such as Thesis (http://diythemes.
com) even have robust support forums where you can learn and get 
support from peers and moderators.
	
✓	Security: Premium themes are more likely to be updated along with the 
blog platform’s updates. Many blog platform updates are to fix security 
issues or potential issues so a free theme that hasn’t been updated can 
leave your blog vulnerable.
	
You can definitely find great, high-quality free themes that you’ll be happy 
with. If you consider using a free theme, just stick with reputable sites to 
ensure the quality.
Finding sources for themes
Finding the perfect theme can sometimes feel like trying to find a needle in 
a haystack. The following list doesn’t cover every great site out there, but it 
should give you plenty of themes to choose from should you decide to use a 
theme.
WordPress.org
WordPress.org (http://www.wordpress.org) is flexible platform for new 
and experienced bloggers. You install and host this platform from your own 
server. Most bloggers pay companies like Hostgator a fee to host their blogs 
versus needing to own their own server. For more about self-hosting, refer to 
Chapter 1.

Gaining more flexibility with 
a WordPress framework
If you’re looking for the most flexibility to build 
whatever your heart desires, I suggest you look 
into WordPress frameworks as the basis for 
your blogging platform. A WordPress frame­
work is basically a very plain structure that sup­
ports a custom WordPress.org theme (known 
as a child theme because, in the hierarchy of 
files that create the blog, the framework is the 
parent and the theme is the child). You can 
purchase a child theme to layer on top of your 
framework (then customize it) or build your own 
child theme, using the framework as your base.
With so much flexibility, give yourself time for 
the learning curve until you get the hang of 
how that framework operates. WordPress Web 
Design For Dummies by Lisa Sabin-Wilson can 
help you learn the technical skills you need to 
get started.
Note that you can’t just put a regular WordPress.
org theme over a framework. You have to use a 
child theme.
You can find free and premium WordPress 
frameworks that might suit you. Some frame­
works offer more drag-and-drop functionality, 
and others provide extensive menus with ways 
to customize your design. Here are some popu­

 Chapter 7: Developing Your Overall Blog Layout
Exploring Ways to Showcase Blog 
Posts on Your Home Page
Regardless of the type of blog layout you want (see earlier sections on your 
choices), you still need to consider how to display blog posts on your home 
page. Some bloggers feature full blog posts, some just use excerpts, and 
others use a mix of both.
Although your layout type may dictate the need for only excerpts — say, a 
magazine-style layout — you still need to consider how many posts you 
display on your home page. 
	
Your main goal here is to attract, not distract. A nice balance of blog posts 
pulls readers into your content rather than distracting them with too many 
choices.
Showing full blog posts or excerpts
Unless you decide on a layout type that calls for just excerpts or images (like 
magazine-style layouts), you have decisions to make regarding how content 
displays on the home page.
Using full blog posts means that if someone visits your home page, they see 
your latest blog post displayed in its entirety. Some bloggers show just one 
full post; other bloggers show a few.
When you show full blog posts, your visitors don’t have to click a link to finish 
reading an entire post. Visitors can fully concentrate on reading through your 
entire post without having to break and wait for a new page to load.
On the downside, full blog posts can slow your home page’s download time, 
especially if your home page includes a lot of full posts or if your posts have 
many images. In addition, full posts can limit a visitor’s ability to see the 
breadth of your content, because you can fit only so many posts on your 
home page. Using a sidebar that effectively shows a wider array of posts 
gives readers a chance to see more without using post excerpts.
	
Of course, you can make some posts on your home page excerpts and still 
show full posts. See the section, “Creating blog post excerpts” for some ways 
on how to use excerpts.
Using excerpts mean that you show snippets or teasers of multiple blog posts 
on your home page. To read the full post, a visitor clicks a link: something 
like Read More.
Using only excerpts on your home page has benefits as well. With excerpts, 
you fit more content in the same space, meaning you can show visitors more 

120
Part II: Choosing the Visual Design Elements 
of what you offer within the main content area. With more to see in one loca­
tion, visitors can easily scan multiple blog post titles and determine which 
posts they want to read. 
Figure 7-9 shows a good use of post excerpts. With excerpts, Mom Spark 
(http://momspark.net) highlights the blog’s diverse topics. A hero image 
(a large, attention-grabbing image at the top of a page) above the home 
page’s main column signifies the most important post, and other excerpts 
nicely highlight other posts worth reading.
© MomSpark.net
Figure 7-9: This design highlights each excerpt with an image and a 
different color over the blog post name.
Because a visitor has to click to view a full post, using excerpts also encour­
ages comments because the comment field is on the page with the full post. 
If you have full posts on the home page, visitors have to load a separate page 
after they read the post to comment. You also see an increase in page views 
due to visitors having to click (although better traffic should never ever be 
the main factor in the decision).
The downside of using excerpts is that not everyone will take the action to 
click a link to finish reading a blog post, especially if the excerpt content 
doesn’t entice the reader enough. Instead, that visitor may read a little bit of 

121
 Chapter 7: Developing Your Overall Blog Layout
each post excerpt and then move on. Also, if you already show full blog posts 
but then change to using excerpts, some readers may resist the change.
	
When making a decision between full posts and excerpts, consider your 
blog’s topics as well as how long your posts typically are. If you write about 
a lot of different topics, using post excerpts makes that fact more apparent 
to your readers because they see snippets of different blog posts rather than 
scrolling through entire posts.
If your posts are shorter in length, using full blog posts might make more 
sense. A reader might be annoyed to click Read More and see only one more 
paragraph of content. Shorter, full posts can allow you to show more on the 
home page without using any Read More links.
	
Not all visitors start at your home page. Many people click a link from a social 
media site or a search engine that goes directly to an article. The decision for 
using full posts or excerpts affects just those who land directly on your home 
page, who often aren’t familiar with your blog.
Deciding how many posts to put on your home page
Whether your home page displays full blog posts or excerpts, you need to 
decide how many posts should appear in your home page’s main content 
section. If you want full posts on your home page, the number of posts to use 
mainly depends on two things:
	
✓	Length of posts: If your blog posts are long — text, images, or both — 
you probably want to include only one full post on your home page. If 
your posts are shorter, maybe you could use as many as three.
	
✓	Sidebar length: Some bloggers have a lot of sidebar content, and others 
keep it to a minimum. You don’t want so many blog posts in your main 
column that visitors have to scroll way past your sidebar content. That 
leaves your content with empty space beside it. On the flip side, you 
don’t want your main column to end and still have a never-ending flow 
of sidebar content, either.
When considering how many excerpts to include, some of that decision may 
be dictated by the blog layout or theme you use. In addition, consider the 
following:
	
✓	Length of excerpts: If your excerpts are on the longer side, you may want to 
use fewer of them. If you go for shorter excerpts, make them long enough 
to entice the reader to actually click through to the rest of the post.
	
✓	Categories to highlight: One of the great things about using excerpts is 
that you can show a better variety of your content in your home page’s 
main column. That being said, if you show excerpts by categories and 
have 12 categories, posting 12 excerpts may look too confusing to a 
visitor. Instead, choose your most popular ones to showcase.

122
Part II: Choosing the Visual Design Elements 
	
After you decide how many posts you think work for your blog and make the 
adjustments on your site, be sure to check that your home page looks great 
visually with a good use of color, images, and overall appeal.
Creating blog post excerpts
So you want to use some blog post excerpts on your home page. Great! This 
section shows you a few common ways to do this in WordPress.org.
The most obvious way is to select 
a theme or framework that either 
uses excerpts automatically or 
makes it easy for you to add them. 
For example, a magazine style theme 
uses excerpts by default. Also, 
WordPress.org frameworks like 
Thesis and Genesis make changing 
your posts to automatic excerpts 
(sometimes called teasers) really 
easy to do.
In Figure 7-10, take a look at the 
teaser options for the Genesis frame­
work. The featured post settings 
(middle section) let you place more 
prominence on your most recent 
posts by making them different than 
the other teasers. To make featured

the field blank for the Limit Featured 
Post Content to xx Characters. In the 
Teaser Settings section, you have options for teasers that display in pairs 
underneath the optional featured posts. Finally, you can select the number of 
posts and customize the “Continue reading” text.
If your blog theme doesn’t have teaser-creation options in your dashboard 
settings, you can do it yourself within the WordPress.org theme.
To make every post on your home page an excerpt that offers a teaser of 
your blog post, follow these steps from your WordPress Admin area:
	
1.	Log into your WordPress.org dashboard.
	
2.	Go to Appearance➪Editor.
	
	This brings up all your template files, the files that control how your site 
displays on the web. On the right side, you see a list of your template 
files while one file loads in the main window.
Figure 7-10: Teaser options depend upon 
framework settings.

 Chapter 7: Developing Your Overall Blog Layout
	
3.	Click your index.php file to open the template in the main window.
	
4.	Find code that starts with <?php the_content.
	
	 The exact location of this code varies by theme. If you don’t see it in 
index.php, look for templates called content.php or loop.php.
	
	 For example, in the Twenty Eleven theme, this code can be found in the 
content.php file. The entire snippet looks like this:
<?php the_content( __( ‘Continue reading <span class
=”meta-nav”>&rarr;</span>’, ‘twentyeleven’ ) ); ?>
	
5.	Change the_content to the_excerpt.
	
	 This makes your blog posts always display on your home page as 
excerpts instead of full posts.
	
	 You can also customize the excerpt link from Continue reading to 
something else.
	
6.	Submit your changes by clicking Update File.
As an alternative, you can also create a simple post excerpt for individual 
posts, rather than modifying a PHP file to automatically do this for every 
new post. Here’s how to do this in WordPress. (In Blogger, look for the Jump 
Break tool in your Post Editor.)
	
1.	Log into your WordPress dashboard.
	
2.	From your menu, choose Posts➪Add New.
	
3.	Type your post and then decide where you want to end the excerpt, 
putting your cursor there.
	
4.	Click the Insert More Tab button from the Visual Editor (it looks like 
two boxes stacked on top of each other, separated by a dashed line).
	
	 This places a faint line with a More tab to mark the place where your 
excerpt ends, as shown in Figure 7-11. If you click the Text tab, you see 
this button added the code <!--more--> to the HTML. Note that pre­
viewing this shows a full post because a preview shows your actual post 
URL — a permalink — not your home page.
	
5.	Click the Publish button to make your post live.
	
	 Visit your home page to see how your post excerpt appears. You can 
see in Figure 7-12 that on the home page, the post ends with a Continue 
Reading link to lead to the full post.
	
To change Continue Reading to something a little more exciting, click the 
Text tab (refer to Step 4 of the preceding list) and then add your custom 
content to read something like <!--more See How the Story Ends-->. 
This changes the message for that particular post only, but have fun with it!

blog posts. Jump to Chapter 15 for some gallery plug-in options.
Deciding Where to Place Advertising
Some bloggers get into blogging primarily to make money, so they advertise 
on their blog from the get-go. Some bloggers start writing and later decide 
to try advertising. And of course, some bloggers want to keep their site free 
from advertising. (If that’s you, just skip this section.)
Advertising plays a crucial role in the impression your overall blog design 
makes on the reader. How do you use advertising in a way that actually makes 
you money but keeps your users from thinking you’re greedy? These next sec­
tions highlight some things to keep in mind so your readers don’t go running.
Putting your visitors first
Although your readers probably don’t 
mind you wanting to earn revenue 
from your blog, they don’t want to be 
bombarded with ads. Whether you 
use a design network or sell your own 
ads directly, good blog design puts 
your readers first while still making 
the advertising beneficial for you.
Advertising can be located in just 
about any place within your blog 
design. Common advertising areas 
include the top banner (also called 
a leader board), anywhere within 
the sidebar, and within the actual 
blog post content (see Figure 7-13). 
You sometimes even see advertising 
replace a blogger’s entire background.
	
When deciding where to place your advertising, consider whether your 
advertising hinders the usability of your blog. Ads should never make your 
blog harder to use or confusing to the reader.
Figure 7-13: Here are common places for 
bloggers to place advertising.

126
Part II: Choosing the Visual Design Elements 
Here are some common culprits of not-optimal advertising:
	
✓	In-text ads: These are contextual ads that hyperlink words in your content 
to ads. When you hover over those words, they pop up with an adver­
tisement. They tend to look unprofessional and spammy, especially when 
a lot of words within a blog post are linked. Also, in-text ads sometimes 
apply links to words completely out of context. For example, I’ve seen an 
in-text ad of a city name link to a travel site when the name was actually 
the name of the blogger’s child.
	
✓	Autoplaying ads: Avoid any advertising that automatically plays videos 
(with sound) or music. These types of ads interrupt the visitor from 
exploring your site or reading your content.
	
✓	Intrusive ads: This type of ad can include anything from pop-overs and 
pop-unders (ads that display in a new browser window underneath the 
current browser window) to those ads that sweep over your blog when 
someone hovers over them.
	
	Be wary of using ads that do this because they interfere with your con­
tent being read. Most browsers have pop-up blockers so pop-up ads may 
not be displayed, anyway.
	
✓	Oddly placed ads within blog posts: Oftentimes, bloggers place text or 
banner ads within their blog post. This is fine when done well, but make 
sure that the size or the location of the ad doesn’t affect the ability to 
actually read the post. In addition, a very large ad at the bottom of your 
post content could separate your content too far from your comment 
section, making it less easy for visitors to comment. Also, check your 
text-based ads to ensure they don’t look too much like the blog post. 
Otherwise, you might frustrate or confuse the reader.
Avoiding advertising overload
You’ve probably been to a website where you felt like you just got smacked 
with a wall of advertising. Maybe on your blog, you’ve added advertising 
piece by piece — an ad network here and a row of ad banners there — but 
never stopped to look at your blog design as a whole.
So, if you have an existing blog, take a step back and take a look at your blog 
design’s overall look and feel. Does an ad interfere with your overall blog design? 
Is advertising making it hard to concentrate on your content?
Too many ads in a sidebar, for example, become such a big jumble that 
you’re essentially reducing the effectiveness of those ads. There are just too 
many things to look at in one view! In addition, a lot of bold, flashy graphics 
detract from your message and leave your visitor feeling overloaded with ads.

127
 Chapter 7: Developing Your Overall Blog Layout
	
Good advertising placement should catch attention of visitors (after all, you 
want them to click) but never at the detriment of your overall design. Your 
blog content should always be easy to spot right away.
	
If you run ads with an ad network like Google AdSense — a program that 
allows you to display targeted Google ads on your blog — you don’t always 
have control over the exact ads that run although you can sometimes make 
exclusions, depending on the network. Look at your ads from time to time to 
ensure nothing surprising sneaks past you.
One blog that does advertising right is the popular Young House Love (www.
younghouselove.com). John and Sherry earn the majority of their income 
through advertising, but their blog doesn’t feel overrun with ads. They orga­
nize the advertising in their sidebars into a few sections. One main advertiser 
appears above the fold. Two sections for sponsors are separated by ad size, 
with one size taking up wider with than the other (Figure 7-14). The blog fea­
tures a We’re Digging section for affiliate products, too. The result is a lot of 
advertising without feeling overwhelming or interfering with content.
Taking care of your current advertisers
Not only do your readers matter, but so do your current advertisers. If you 
sell advertising space on your blog, you have a direct relationship with your 
advertisers. You gotta treat them right!
Have you ever been to a blog whose advertising section looks like the image 
in Figure 7-15? Surrounded by vacant advertising space, the one ad completely 
gets overtaken by Advertise Here buttons. Not only is this a disservice to 
the advertiser, but too many blank ad spaces can also deter potential adver­
tisers. The blank spaces give the impression that your site isn’t attracting 
enough visitors.
So what do you do? Try not to have more than one Advertise Here blank at 
any given time. (If you have eight spots or more, you can possibly get away 
with two blanks.) Then fill the rest in with affiliate marketing buttons. Also, 
consider adding a link like “Interested in advertising with me? Contact me.” 
underneath the ads and link to your contact info.

Customizing Your Header, 
Footer, and Background
In This Chapter
▶	Making a first impression with a blog header
▶	Determining whether to use a tagline
▶	Creating a blog header that gets visitors clicking
▶	Building a footer than gets noticed
▶	Adding a background to your blog design
C

olors, fonts, and graphic elements all play into your blog design. 
Separately, they each communicate just a bit about your blog’s content. 
When you put them together, the magic really starts to work.
This chapter tackles three components of your blog design: your blog header, 
footer, and background design. When you look at these three parts as a whole, 
you see a mix of content, fonts, and graphic elements brought to life in a 
cohesive blog design.
A blog header, footer, and background all play an important role in your 
overall blog design, yet they do so in very different ways. In this chapter, I 
describe each element’s role in your overall blog design. You see how a blog 
header sets the tone for your blog, whether you need a tagline, how to size a 
header, and even how to create a simple header. In addition, I explain how a 
footer can get readers to take action and show you ideas that you can build 
into your footer. I also walk you through creating a custom background pat­
tern and how to decide whether a solid color or pattern works best.
Expressing Visual Identity with 
a Strong Blog Header
Your blog’s visual identity speaks volumes about its content, tone, and 
credibility.

132
Part II: Choosing the Visual Design Elements 
Your blog header becomes the first opportunity to present your blog. I’m not 
exaggerating when I say that without a well-designed blog header, you poten­
tially shoo away new visitors because either your blog header doesn’t look 
professional (which diminishes your credibility) or doesn’t sync with the 
voice and tone of your content (which confuses new visitors).
Making a great first impression
I imagine you’ve purchased a car at some point in your life. What made you 
choose the cars that you test drove? Maybe a friend recommended a certain 
model, or you researched a car with great safety ratings. Even with those sug­
gestions, you probably didn’t peek in the window to see the interior unless 
you liked the look of the car’s exterior at first glance.
Only after you notice the car’s exterior do you peek into that window and 
even open the door for a test drive. Like a car’s exterior, your header attracts 
a visitor’s eye and creates a new visitor’s first impression of your blog.
To make a first impression, one study shows that you have less than two-
tenths of a second. The study also states that it takes about 2.6 seconds for 
your visitors’ eyes to spot the area of a website that most influences their 
first impression. So, when you design your blog header, ask yourself, “Does 
my blog header communicate enough of what my blog is about?”
	
That doesn’t mean your blog header design needs to literally say what you 
write about. Focus on the impression the header leaves in a reader’s mind.
In Figure 8-1, the blog Momma’s Gone City (www.mommasgonecity.com) 
leaves a positive impression with a header that uses just one image along 
with the blog name. Jessica writes about parenting, fashion, and adjusting to 
city life — and the image subtly conveys that. Even the movement of her trav­
eling into the subway helps pull the reader down into her blog.

Figure 8-1: The header for this blog fits perfectly with its topics.

133
 Chapter 8: Customizing Your Header, Footer, and Background
	
When designing your own blog header, ensure that your header communi­
cates what you blog about by incorporating the following characteristics:
	
✓	Professional: You don’t need to hire someone to design your blog, but 
successfully applying the tips and ideas you can glean from this book 
give your blog a professional feel, making visitors place more trust in 
you and your content.
	
✓	Memorable: From the colors to the fonts to the words, your blog header 
design should showcase what makes your blog memorable. If you’re a 
humor blogger, your blog header better have an element of humor to it, 
whether it’s a funny photo or laugh-out-loud tagline. (More on taglines in 
just a bit.)
	
✓	Attractive to your target audience: Your blog header design should at 
least partly align with what attracts your target audience. If you blog 
about children’s crafts, readers don’t expect your header design to be 
stark, muted colors. On the opposite end, that doesn’t mean you have to 
use a childlike font with every letter a different color, either.
	
If you don’t have a solid grasp of your audience or how your blog stands out, 
see Chapter 3 to get to know your blog a little better.
Deciding whether you need a tagline
You already know a new visitor forms an impression about your blog based 
on your header design, but design alone doesn’t explain what your blog is 
about. Blog names can often be descriptive enough, but not all blog names 
stand on their own. If you didn’t already know about Amazon.com, would you 
know that it’s an e-commerce site just based on its name? Nope.
For that, you need a tagline, which supports your blog name and design by 
summing up your blog’s key message in just a few words. Standing alone, tag­
lines range from seemingly random to very descriptive. However, after you 
pair your blog name and header design, a tagline complements your branding 
and gives you the opportunity to tell your story so that the reader doesn’t 
have to guess what you’re all about. Consider how movie studios often give 
movies a memorable tagline to drive interest in a movie. For example, Jaws 
had the tagline “Don’t Go in the Water.” Combined with the movie name (and 
that famous image of a shark with its sharp-toothed mouth wide open), the 
tagline creates a more powerful emotion of fear than the name alone. With 
a great tagline for your blog, you put readers in the right frame of mind for 
reading your content.
Hmm. If you study other blogs, though, you’ll notice that not every blog has 
a tagline. So, do you really need one? Try this test to decide. Spend about 
three seconds looking at your blog design through the eyes of a new visitor. 

134
Part II: Choosing the Visual Design Elements 
(Remember: That’s about as long as it takes to make an impression — a very 
short 2.6 seconds to be exact.) Then ask yourself: If someone were visiting for 
the first time, would they know what my blog is about in those few seconds?
If your blog name and header design describe your blog’s content well enough, 
then you could do without a tagline. However, a good tagline serves to rein­
force the message your blog name and header design send to the reader.
Here’s an example. Say your blog is named something like The Smith Family 
News. A generic name like that does nothing to tell new visitors what your 
blog is about. Adding a tagline within your blog header design gives those 
visitors more insight as to why your blog is unique. What about your family? 
Why should people care? What’s interesting about your blog? Maybe it’s 
Tales about life with all boys or Inspiration from a family healing after tragedy.
Just like blog header designs, taglines don’t have to be literal. Johnny B. Truant 
(http://johnnybtruant.com) uses his online pseudonym as his blog name. 
As you can see in Figure 8-2, his tagline The Internet Made Awesome gives you 
the sense that he blogs about web-related topics, while the tone gives you 
the impression his blog will be punchy and helpful all at the same time.

Figure 8-2: This tagline is clear and catchy.
Choosing an effective header size
When designing your blog header, you have to decide how large or small 
to make it without compromising that all-important first impression. When 
thinking about header size, consider what shows up above the fold, which is 
the part of your blog a reader sees before they have to scroll further down 
the page. A great header design entices a visitor enough to read a blog post, 
click a link in the navigation menu, or explore your blog in some other way.
The best size for your blog header width will vary depending on your blog 
theme. Within your blog’s dashboard, on the tab where you upload your 
header, your theme or framework may suggest an optimal size based on your 
layout. If you’re unsure what width to make your header, see Chapter 9 for an 
explanation of using Firebug to determine the sizes of blog elements.

135
 Chapter 8: Customizing Your Header, Footer, and Background
As far as height goes, many designers will tell you not to exceed 200 to 300 
pixels high for a blog design. In general, a header larger than this pushes all 
your content and menus below the fold (the area that a user has to scroll 
down to see, although this area varies slightly depending on your screen size). 
Having said that, using a large header isn’t a bad thing when done effectively.
If you’re considering using a blog header design that goes way under or way 
over those 200 to 300 pixels, then consider these points:
	
✓	Small header height
	
	Pro: A small, well-designed header not only communicates what your 
blog is about, but it also leaves a lot of space above the fold to show a 
visitor other things that might interest them. In Figure 8-3, notice that 
Chris Garrett’s blog header (www.chrisg.com) doesn’t take up much 
space. At first glance, you see not only the header, but also a navigation 
menu, two headlines from recent posts, a little blurb about Chris in the 
sidebar, and a graphic encouraging visitors to sign up for his e-mail list.
	
	Con: A small header design may not have enough visual oomph to draw 
in a reader. Picture a generic header design that includes just a blog 
name in a standard font. Although that doesn’t take up a lot of space 
on your overall layout, that type of header lacks the ability to visually 
showcase anything about your blog to a new visitor.
© Chris Garrett, ChrisG.com
Figure 8-3: This blog uses a small header size that still gets noticed.

136
Part II: Choosing the Visual Design Elements 
	
✓	Large header height
	
	Pro: A large header can be done right and really pack some punch. If you 
want a larger header, be sure that at least some important component 
of your blog design — such as your menu navigation — shows above 
the fold. In Figure 8-4, you see that the header on Mama’s Losin’ It (www.
mamakatslosinit.com) takes up a lot of space, yet you can still see a 
top navigation menu and the section showing her latest blog post.
	
	Con: Large headers take up a lot of real estate in your overall blog 
design. When done ineffectively, a large header covers all the space 
above the fold, leaving no room for a navigation menu, blog post title, 
sidebar, or anything else before your reader has to scroll down. That 
means you lose the opportunity to show more of your blog and must 
rely on your reader’s desire to scroll down to see more.
© www.mamakatslosinit.com, Site Design: Jamie Varon, www.shatterboxx.com
Figure 8-4: This large blog header grabs attention.
	
Always test your header in different screen resolutions to see how it looks. 
The worst thing that can happen is your header is so large that readers have 
to scroll from one side to another to see it. Not only will this cut off your 
design, but as Internet users, we rarely scroll from side to side because that 
movement feels awkward. See Chapter 7 for more information about page 
width.

137
 Chapter 8: Customizing Your Header, Footer, and Background
Designing a simple header
Don’t be intimidated designing a header just because you can take the design 
in so many directions. With the content presented in this book, you can give 
it a good shot.
To get your creative juices flowing, I want to show you how to create a really 
simple header design. I’m using Photoshop, which is available for both Macs 
and PCs — and, unlike some web-based editing programs (like PicMonkey), 
you can use your own fonts. (Read how to get your own fonts in Chapter 
6.) Photoshop is a pricey investment, but luckily you can create everything 
you’d need for a blog design with Photoshop Elements, which costs less than 
Photoshop. (Read more about Photoshop, Photoshop Elements, and other 
editing programs in Chapter 15.)
To create a simple image-based header in Photoshop, follow these steps (for 
Photoshop Elements, the steps are similar but not exactly the same):
	
1.	Open Photoshop.
	
2.	Choose File➪New.
	
	 A window pops up, asking for you to title your file and input dimensions. 
For this header, I set the dimensions to 1000 x 288 pixels.
	
3.	Create a new layer by pressing Ctrl+Shift+N (PC) or ⌘+Shift+N (Mac).
	
	 This layer is where you create a rectangle that constrains your image to 
a certain size without needing to crop it. This is a mask.
	
4.	Give your layer a title and then click OK.
	
	 I called mine Image Mask.
	
5.	Within this layer, you then create the rectangle that you use to mask 
your image.
	
a.	Select the Rectangle tool from the Tools panel.
	
b.	From the Control Panel menu at the top, click the Geometry Options 
drop-down arrow (see Figure 8-5).
	
	This opens the Rectangle Options dialog box.

Rectangle tool

Choose a Fixed Size
Figure 8-5: In the Control Panel, you can set a shape to be a specific size.
	
c.	Enter dimensions into the W (width) and H (height) text boxes.
	
	I input 1000 and 200 pixels so I can fill the entire width of my blog 
design but have room for my blog name at the top. Note that Fixed 
Size is selected by default.
	
d.	Move your cursor into your canvas.
	
	A plus sign appears.
	
e.	Click to drop a rectangle onto your canvas.
	
f.	Move the rectangle into position by clicking the Move tool from the 
top of your Tools panel. Then click and drag your cursor on the rect­
angle to move it into desired position.
	
6.	Place your photo into the file.
	
a.	Open the desired photo in a separate file.
	
b.	Using the Move tool, click and drag that image into your header 
image file.
	
	 Don’t worry about exactly where you place it.

139
 Chapter 8: Customizing Your Header, Footer, and Background
	
7.	Mask the image.
	
	 Remember that a mask hides the parts of your image that don’t show 
through the rectangle shape you created. Using a mask prevents you from 
having to crop the image to the exact proportion you want for your design.
	
a.	Place your cursor on the line between the photo layer and the Image 
Mask layer in the Layers palette.
	
b.	Hold down the Alt key (Option on Mac).
	
	The cursor symbol becomes two overlapping circles.
	
c.	Click to create the mask.
	
	With the mask now created, you can move the mask up and down so 
that the area of your photo you’d like to display is visible. In Figure 8-6, 
the black line indicates my image’s actual dimensions; only a portion 
of the image shows up in the rectangle.

8.	Add and format the blog name.
	
a.	Click the Type tool from the Tools panel.
	
b.	Click the cursor anywhere on the canvas to start typing (and type the 
name).
	
c.	Use the Control Panel at the top to control the font, size, and other 
type-formatting settings.
	
	To adjust the color, select the color square within the Control 
Panel. You can either enter color values or use the Eyedropper by 
clicking a part in your photo to pull color from there. (See Chapter 
6 for details about color in your overall blog design.)
	
9.	When you’re done adjusting the font, select the Move tool from the 
Tools panel to move the blog name into the desired location.
	
	 I like the look of the blog name sitting atop the photo. You can see my 
final blog header design in Figure 8-7. 
	
10.	Save the Photoshop file by choosing File➪Save.
Figure 8-7: Finished blog header. Nice!
Because blogs can’t read Photoshop files, now you need to make the photo 
web-friendly. Starting with the Photoshop file already open, you can do this 
in a few easy steps:
	
1.	Choose File➪Save for Web & Devices.
	
	 A Preview window opens, showing your image.
	
2.	Click the 2-Up tab at the top left of the window.
	
	 This shows you two versions of your file: the original and the one you 
are saving from the original.
	
3.	Try an image format from the Presets menu options, using the JPG or 
PNG options.

141
 Chapter 8: Customizing Your Header, Footer, and Background
	
	JPG files are a better choice if your blog header is heavy on photo­
graphs. PNG files are better for illustrations (like graphs or icons) and 
text-heavy images.
	
	As you select a Preset, the preview image updates, showing you any 
changes in quality. 
	
4.	Select Save to save the file onto your computer.
	
	 You can then add the file to your blog, using whatever tools and meth­
ods your blog software makes available.
Photoshop and Photoshop Elements enable you to create fairly complex 
graphics using layers, masks, and more. If you invest in one of the these 
programs, check out Photoshop For Dummies by Peter Bauer or Photoshop 
Elements For Dummies by Barbara Obermeier and Ted Padova for help get­
ting the most out of either of these powerful programs.
Enhancing Navigation with a Blog Footer
Oh, the footer: blog design’s underdog. As bloggers, we get so wrapped up 
with all that stuff above the fold — like the header and top of the sidebar — 
and sometimes forget to make an impression in the last place a visitor often 
sees: the blog footer.
Sometimes people just think of blog footers as a place to put the boring 
stuff, such as privacy policy links or copyright information, but footers can 
be much more than that. This section shows how a blog footer can provide 
visitors with helpful navigation paths so your footer becomes less of an after­
thought and more of a way to fuel your blog goals.
Creating a useful footer
Before you get into actually creating a blog footer, you should know what role 
a footer plays in relation to your entire blog design. A blog visitor doesn’t 
scroll straight to the bottom of your page to see your footer (unless they’re 
looking something specific). Instead, the majority of your blog visitors sort of 
stumble onto it. They read a great blog post, maybe take a look at your side­
bar, and then mosey their way down to the bottom of your page until there is 
nowhere left to scroll.
When visitors get to the bottom of your page, what they want to know is, 
“What do I do now?” With that in mind, think about how the things you add in 
the footer fuel your blog goals.

142
Part II: Choosing the Visual Design Elements 
A great footer example is from The Everywhereist (www.everywhereist.
com). As you can see in Figure 8-8, a bold line lets you know that you’re in 
footer territory. Geraldine’s blog footer highlights everything from social 
media links to her e-mail list to her Flickr feed. Underneath the more visual 
elements, you have the copyright, a privacy policy link, and other footer-like 
content, followed by a subtle yet impactful strip that mimics her blog header.

Keeping the reader’s question in mind — What do I do now? — start by listing 
the things you want to include in your footer. I want to give you a lot of ideas 
to choose from, but remember not to cram in everything. Make choices that 
go back to the goals for your blog design. (For help on that, see Chapter 3.)
Some blog footers simply show a row of links. Some have three or four col­
umns of content. And some include both, like Dear Crissy’s footer shown in 
Figure 8-9.

 Chapter 8: Customizing Your Header, Footer, and Background
As for what type of a links to include, a blog footer often includes links, such as
	
✓	Copyright information: Although you don’t need copyright info to 
protect your content and blog design, having the copyright symbol on 
your page can deter potential infringers. Using something like © 2013 
Momcomm – All Rights Reserved prevents someone from saying they 
didn’t know your content was copyrighted. Make this a must-add to your 
blog footer.
	
✓	Back to Top link: After a reader scrolls all the way to the bottom of your 
page, it’s nice to easily get back to the top of your page with the click of 
a button.
	
✓	Privacy policy: A privacy policy lays out your blog’s policies regarding 
how you gather, use, disclose or manage someone’s personal data. For 
bloggers, this often covers things like advertising, affiliate links, and 
sponsored content as well as whether your blog uses cookies.
	
✓	FAQ: Some bloggers may want a frequently asked questions page, which 
works well in a navigation menu, too.
	
✓	Advertise: Blogs sometimes include a link to an advertising page.
	
✓	Blog designer: If you hire professionals to design part or all of your blog 
design, they may want you to put a link to their website in your footer. 
Grant this wish — they are awesome!
	
✓	Archives: Footers sometimes have a link to an archives page of all your 
posts arranged by date. Instead of a link to a separate page, some blogs 
include an abbreviated archives in the footer.
	
✓	Sitemap: A link to a blog’s sitemap can help visitors with a mission find 
what they’re looking for by getting a high-level view of your content. See 
Chapter 10 for more about sitemaps.
	
Just because I consider each of the preceding items “standard” doesn’t mean 
that you should include them all. Choose the ones that are important to your 
blog, and then run with it.
Now, consider all the potential ways you can add other content to your footer. 
When you want your footer to have more oomph, consider the following 
additions to your footer:
	
✓	Social media buttons: If your social media buttons are at the top of your 
blog (like they should be), readers no longer see them at the bottom of 
your blog. Placing these buttons also in your footer subtly reminds read­
ers to subscribe, friend, or follow.
	
✓	About you or your blog: You can add a little blurb about you or your 
blog and then link to a fuller About page for all the details.

144
Part II: Choosing the Visual Design Elements 
	
✓	Facebook widget: This widget makes it easy for readers to like your 
blog’s Facebook page, because they don’t even have to leave your blog 
to do so. I talk more about this widget in Chapter 11.
	
✓	Latest tweets: Give readers a glimpse of the things you tweet by showing 
a few of your most current tweets.
	
✓	As seen on: Have you been featured or interviewed by a high-profile show 
or publication? Show off your credibility by highlighting any publicity 
you or your blog have received. 
	
✓	Widget for visual social media platforms: Showcase your awesome 
shots from Instagram, Flickr, and Pinterest.
	
✓	E-mail sign up: Give users another opportunity to subscribe to your 
e-mail list by making the sign-up form conveniently displayed again at 
the bottom of your blog.
	
✓	Recent posts or comments: Highlight the latest posts you’ve written or 
comments others have left. Note: Try not to use them both because they 
can clutter your footer with too much text.
	
✓	Link to other sites you own or contribute to: Give readers an opportu­
nity to enjoy other places you write by including them here.
	
When deciding what awesomeness to put into your footer, picture a blog 
reader making their way to the end of your blog and wondering what to do 
next.
In Figure 8-9, you see a footer that shows both links and visual elements as 
well. Crissy has a large Twitter following, so having her latest tweet and a 
button to follow her makes it easy to grow that audience even further. In 
addition, she’s growing her e-mail list with a simple e-mail subscription form.
Incorporating a footer into your design
Unlike a blog header design, creating a footer for your blog design can’t be 
done in a photo-editing program. A footer is a live, clickable part of your site, 
not a static image.
How you actually add a footer on your own blog really depends on the plat­
form and theme that you use. Many WordPress themes and Blogger tem­
plates include a “widgetized” footer, which lets you add items to your footer 
through widgets just as you would do on a sidebar.
As you can see in Figure 8-10, the WordPress Twenty Eleven theme lets you drag 
widgets (such as Recent Posts or Search) to the footer and then customize 
from there.

145
 Chapter 8: Customizing Your Header, Footer, and Background
Figure 8-10: In WordPress, go to Widgets from your dashboard to see these widgetized footer boxes.
Some WordPress themes offer a widgetized footer as a plug-in add-on, such 
as the Genesis Widgetized Footer plug-in:
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/genesis-widgetized-
footer
Both options make it easy to create a footer without getting into coding your 
site.
Polishing Your Design with a Blog Background
A blog background provides an important supporting role to your overall 
blog design. A good background design complements your content rather 
than overtaking it. Your background should be consistent with the overall 
branding of your blog design and help set the tone for your site.
In this section, I talk about ways to create a background that gives your over­
all blog design a polished finishing touch.
Deciding on a solid or graphical background
While your background design plays a supporting role to your overall blog 
design, you still have choices to make. You can go with a solid colored 

146
Part II: Choosing the Visual Design Elements 
background for a simple look or go a little (or a lot) more complex with a 
graphical background. The decision rests partly in your header design. Is 
your header full of design elements or colorful photographs? Then try a solid 
colored background. Is your header design clean and simple? Then a graphi­
cal background can add some pop to your blog design.
Regardless of which one you choose, you don’t want to make the fatal mistake 
of distracting from the star of your blog: your content. Strive for a background 
design that provides balance in the overall look and feel of your blog design.
For a solid background color, try pulling a color from your blog’s color pal­
ette or use a neutral color, such as white or gray. To go one step beyond a 
solid color, use a gradient background that subtly blends two colors.
	
Many blog platforms or themes default to having white behind the main con­
tent and sidebars, leaving the sides of your blog design for the actual back­
ground color or pattern. If that’s not the case and your background color 
shows up directly behind your content, be careful not to use a really dark 
color behind your main content. Most users find this design choice extremely 
hard to read, even if the text is white. Use white text on a dark background 
only in small doses, not for your main content.
With a graphical background, you add complexity to your blog design. Here 
are some popular ways to use a graphical background:
	
✓	Textures: Cross-patterns, lines, linen, or other textures add subtle visual 
interest to your background design. Single colors or colors within the 
same color range make nice low-contrast textures. In Figure 8-11, Erin of 
Design for MiniKind (http://designforminikind.com) uses a subtle 
gray texture for her blog background.
	
✓	Illustrations: If you’re feeling artsy, you can use a graphics program to 
create a visually engaging background design that incorporates design 
elements that you downloaded or created yourself.
	
✓	Large image: Using large images that cover your entire background can 
really create a cool effect. When done right, they make a big impact with­
out pulling readers away from your content.
	
✓	Tiled patterns: A common background tiles a pattern across the width 
of your blog, forming a seamless design. In the upcoming section, 
“Creating your own background pattern,” I show you how to create a 
simple background pattern.
	
With graphical backgrounds, you might find it harder for your background 
not to overwhelm your blog design. I give you some great choices in the next 
section.

Finding background patterns
You might luck out and find a pattern that fits perfectly with how you envision 
your blog design, but here are some places you can peruse to find patterns.
	
✓	PatternCooler: (www.patterncooler.com) This website should be your 
first stop if you want to use an existing pattern versus designing your 
own. From subtle to not-so-subtle, you can find just about anything 
you can think of: stripes, flowers, dots, teardrops, and so on. For extra 
awesomeness, you use the Editor here (www.patterncooler.com/
editor) to customize the colors of any pattern.
	
✓	COLOURlovers: (www.colourlovers.com/patterns) I mention this 
site in Chapter 6 as a great source of color inspiration. It’s also a great site 
for patterns. The website features patterns created (and rated) by the 
COLOURlovers community. You can customize any pattern’s colors by 
clicking Color This Pattern underneath the pattern image.
	
✓	Subtle Patterns: (http://subtlepatterns.com) So many background 
sites have overly complex, sometimes garish background patterns. Subtle 
Patterns, shown in Figure 8-12, is a breath of fresh air. The textures on 
this site mainly consist of whites, blacks, or grays. However, you can 
change the color of the patterns with some photo-editing software, such 
as Adobe Photoshop.

148
Part II: Choosing the Visual Design Elements 
Figure 8-12: Don’t overlook a subtle pattern that won’t overtake your design.
	
✓	Texturevault: (www.texturevault.net) Texturevault offers profes­
sional textures and background patterns with lots of categories. This is 
the only site I mention that charges for textures; however, prices start at 
just $2. This site’s tutorials explain ways to use textures in design.
	
✓	Background Labs: (www.backgroundlabs.com) You can download 
each background image as a GIF file or Photoshop pattern. All the pat­
terns on the site are illustrations. You can also find backgrounds for 
your Twitter page and PowerPoint presentations here.
	
✓	Texture King: (www.textureking.com) For industrial or earthy textures, 
try this site. Categories like grunge, rust, metals, glass, and plaster give 
you plenty of options for a rugged or an earthy look. All the textures are 
photo-based, not illustrations.
Creating your own background pattern
Does something about your blog design or your creative instincts inspire you 
to create your own pattern? Sure, creating patterns can get complex, but it 
doesn’t have to be. You can create your own seamless pattern with the user-
friendly COLOURlovers Seamless Lite app.

149
 Chapter 8: Customizing Your Header, Footer, and Background
First, you need to create a COLOURlovers account (don’t worry — it’s free!):
	
1.	Go to the COLOURlovers homepage (www.colourlovers.com).
	
2.	Click Sign Up in the upper-right corner.
	
	This directs you to the registration form.
	
3.	Fill out the form by entering a username, password, e-mail, and the 
security code you seen on-screen.
	
4.	Click Create Account.
	
	 You are taken to a confirmation page. From here you can start using 
Seamless Lite by following the steps below. 
To create a custom background pattern using Seamless Lite, follow these 
steps:
	
1.	Go to the Seamless Lite application (www.colourlovers.com/
seamless).
	
	 You see a main window with a light gray square in the middle. This 
serves as the canvas for your pattern. What you design in this space will 
repeat itself to create a pattern. Shapes and layers to build your pattern 
are on the left side of the page. Click the slider on the upper right of the 
page to zoom into the canvas. You can see this interface in Figure 8-13.
	
2.	To begin a pattern, select a shape from any of the categories and drag 
the shape onto your canvas.
	
	 The shape automatically repeats in the darker gray space outside your 
canvas. This lets you see how your design would look when replicated 
into a pattern.
	
3.	Adjust the shape’s size by clicking any of the points that frame the 
shape.
	
	 Hold down the Shift key to maintain the shape’s proportions.
	
4.	(Optional) To rotate the shape, click the point above the shape. When 
the rotation arrow appears, rotate as you wish.
	
5.	Add more shapes to build your pattern.
	
	 You can take your design in any direction you like. To continue using 
the exact same shape you created using Steps 2 and 3, use the Clone 
button under the Layers palette. As you can see in Figure 8-13, I cloned a 
hexagon three times, moving each hexagon into place after cloning it.

150
Part II: Choosing the Visual Design Elements 
Figure 8-13: Repeat a base shape to form a larger pattern.
	
6.	When you’re satisfied with your pattern design, click the Save button 
at the bottom of your page.
	
	Sign in to your COLOURlovers account, or select Click here to register if 
you aren’t already a member. After that’s complete, fill out the required 
information and save your pattern template.
	
7.	Select colors for your pattern.
	
a.	Underneath your pattern, shaded gray squares denote the different 
shades of your pattern. Click a gray square to add color.
	
	As you can see in Figure 8-14, a window appears for you to choose 
a color.
	
b.	Pick your color by using the color picker or by inputting a hex code or 
RGB values.
	
	Read more about hex codes and RGB values in Chapter 6.
	
	If you created a color 
not yet used by another 
COLOURlovers member, 
you are asked to name the 
color. Get creative!
	
8.	Enter your pattern name in the 
required field and then click 
Create Pattern to finish your 
pattern.
	
	 This brings up your pattern pro­
file page with details that show 
your pattern’s colors, ways to 
download the pattern, and other 
details.
Figure 8-14: Use the color picker to select 
awesome colors for your pattern design.

151
 Chapter 8: Customizing Your Header, Footer, and Background
	
9.	To save your pattern as a tile 
for your background, click the 
Preview link on the right side­
bar, as shown in Figure 8-15.
	
	 This opens the tile in a new 
browser window.
	
10.	Right-click the tile, choose Save 
Image As from the menu that 
appears, and then save it to 
your computer.
	
When you use Seamless Lite, your 
pattern uploads to be viewed publicly 
by the COLOURlovers community. 
That’s just how it is. However, you can download your final file and then 
delete it afterward. Or, in the right column, you can set the pattern’s Creative 
Commons license so you don’t grant rights to use your pattern.
If you want to keep your patterns private (and you plan on doing this more 
than once), try the desktop app Seamless Studio (www.colourlovers.com/
seamless-studio). You can try it for free for 15 days and then purchase it 
for $49 ($29 if you become a COLOURlovers member for free).
Adding a background to your blog
After you have a background that you’re ready to use in your blog design, 
it’s time to add it to your blog. This section shows you how to create a solid 
background and a tiled background using the Twenty Eleven theme on 
WordPress.org.
Create a solid background
To add a solid-colored background, follow these steps:
	
1.	Choose Appearance➪Background.
	
	 The Custom Background page appears. By default, the background color 
is white.
	
2.	To change the background to a solid color, you have two options:
	
•	Enter the hexadecimal color code in the Background Color text box.
	
•	Click the Select a Color link and then use the color wheel shown in 
Figure 8-16 to choose a color.
Figure 8-15: Clicking Preview loads your tile 
pattern in a new browser tab.

Part II: Choosing the Visual Design Elements 
Figure 8-16: Use the color picker on the WordPress Custom Background page.
	
3.	Click the Save Changes button.
	
	 Be sure to click this button, or your settings won’t change.
Display a patterned background
If you have a pattern that you want to tile across your blog’s background, 
follow these steps.
	
1.	Choose Appearance➪Background.
	
	 The Custom Background page appears. By default, the background color 
is white.
	
2.	Upload an image from your computer by clicking the Choose File 
button in the Select Image section.
	
	 This opens a window and lets you select the image on your computer.
	
3.	Click the Upload button.
	
	After the image finishes uploading, it automatically shows up in the 
Preview window as a tiled image. Display Options also appear under­
neath the Upload Image feature, as shown in Figure 8-17.
	
4.	(Optional) If needed, change the settings of your background image:
	
•	Position: Use the Left, Center, or Right options to set the screen 
position of the background image on your blog design.
	
•	Repeat: Use the No Repeat, Tile, Tile Horizontally, or Tile Vertically 
options to set whether or how the background image tiles within a 
browser window.
	
•	Attachment: Use the Scroll option to let your background image 
scroll down the page. Use the Fixed option to set the background 
image so it doesn’t scroll down the page.

153
 Chapter 8: Customizing Your Header, Footer, and Background
	
5.	Click the Save Changes button.
	
	 Be sure to click this button, or your settings won’t take effect.
	
Some WordPress themes don’t let you display a patterned background. Also, 
other platforms like Blogger and Typepad have different methods for chang­
ing your background. Despite the platform or theme, you can always change 
your background by modifying your CSS, which I cover in Chapter 9.

Customizing the Design with 
Coding Basics
In This Chapter
▶	Understanding the difference between HTML and CSS
▶	Seeing basic HTML formatting
▶	Customizing the look of your blog design with CSS
▶	Enhancing your coding knowledge with Firebug
I

 was once asked whether I thought a blogger had to know code to be suc­
cessful. One of the great things about blogging is that just about anyone with 
a computer and an Internet connection can set up a blog and publish a post.
However, bloggers like to tweak things. Adjust a color here, change a font 
there. Whether or not you design your entire blog, at some point you’ll want 
to make at least minor changes yourself. That’s when you could use some 
basic HTML and CSS knowledge. And where this chapter is your friend.
This chapter won’t make you a coding expert. What it will do, though, is 
give you a greater understanding of HTML and CSS so you can make simple 
tweaks to your blog’s content and design. I also give you one killer tool for 
learning more about how code works on your blog (and for making tweaks 
without messing anything up).
	
Although this book doesn’t get into detail about PHP, you should know what 
it is. In essence, PHP performs the functions of your blog. And because PHP 
makes your blog do stuff, if you mess up the code in your PHP file, your blog 
may not work properly or may crash altogether. There are some sections of 
this book where you need to alter your PHP, but for the most part, I stick to 
CSS and HTML. If you’re interested in learning more about how website code 
works, check out PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, & HTML5 All-in-One For Dummies by 
Steve Seuhring and Janet Valade. 

156
Part II: Choosing the Visual Design Elements 
	
One last word before you start: Always back up your blog before digging into 
code! Most hosted blogging platforms perform backups for you, but you can 
manually back up too (typically from an Export function within your dash­
board). For WordPress.org, either back up through your host’s control panel 
or by using a backup plugin like WP-DB-Backup (http://wordpress.org/
extend/plugins/wp-db-backup) or WP Online Backup (http://
wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wponlinebackup). 
Seeing How HTML and CSS Work Together
To understand how HTML and CSS work together, you need to know what 
they are.
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. By “marking up” content 
within an HTML document, you instruct a web browser to display that con­
tent on a website in a certain way. This could be anything from turning text 
into a hyperlink to displaying an image.
To mark up your HTML document, you use tags. Tags contain an HTML ele­
ment between less-than (<) and greater-than (>) symbols. These tags identify 
where your command begins and ends. For example, this snippet
<p>This is my wonderful paragraph.</p>
commands that everything between the opening <p> and the closing </p> 
is to display as a paragraph. Notice that the closing tag uses a / to mark it as 
ending the command.
CSS stands for cascading style sheet. CSS comprises a set of commands that 
can customize the look and feel of your blog design by styling the display 
of various elements on your blog, from the font color to a space around an 
image.
CSS rules include two basic parts:
	
✓	A selector (so called because it selects the HTML to which the CSS 
instructions apply)
	
✓	At least one declaration (which declares what the CSS should do)
	
	Then, each declaration has two parts:
	
•	A property (that is, what property the CSS changes)
	
•	A value (how that property changes)
For example, this CSS rule makes paragraph text gray:
p {color: #808080;}

157
 Chapter 9: Customizing the Design with Coding Basics
And here is how:
	
✓	p is the selector, which selects the text in any pair of <p> tags in your 
HTML file.
	
✓	{color: #808080;} is the declaration.
	
✓	color is the property of the declaration.
	
✓	#808080 is the value of the property, or the hexadecimal code for the 
color gray.
Putting the HTML and CSS together, think of creating your blog design like 
building a house. HTML is the structure of your house; CSS is the paint and 
décor. CSS is useless without a structure to apply it to, just like paint does no 
good without walls to put it on.
Basic HTML Every Blogger Should Know
At some point in your blogging existence, you have to use some HTML. Even 
though you probably write your blog posts using a visual editor that lets 
you just click a button to, say, add a link or bold a word, you may have used 
HTML in other areas of your blog, such as to add an image to your sidebar. 
Of course, knowing some HTML doesn’t hurt when you have to troubleshoot 
content that’s not displaying properly.
These next few sections show you how to make some simple edits in your 
text formatting and blog design using HTML.
	
If you run into any issues with your code not working, make sure you use a 
closing tag (like </p>).
Inserting hyperlinks
As an Internet user, you know that hyperlinks are links that take you to another 
location or file by clicking a word or group of words. In HTML, hyperlinks look 
like the bold text in the following example:
<p>This is a <a href=”http://www.momcomm.com”>great blog 
post</a>.</p>
When you break down the HTML for the link, you notice the following elements:
	
✓	<a: This is a start tag. Hyperlinks start with an anchor tag, denoted by 
the a.
	
✓	href=: This is an attribute, which provides additional information about 
the HTML element and is always noted in the start tag.

158
Part II: Choosing the Visual Design Elements 
	
✓	“http://www.momcomm.com”: The URL is the href attribute’s value, 
which is the page, document, or file that you want the text anchored to. 
The value appears within the double quote marks. Here, you insert the 
web address where your visitors will go if they click the link. For the 
link to work, you need to include the full web address, which includes 
the http:// (or whatever protocol your destination site uses, such as 
https://, ftp://, and so on).
	
✓	>: This closes the start tag.
	
✓	great blog post: This text displays on 
your blog and is clickable by your visitors. 
Figure 9-1 shows how the linked text dis­
plays in a blog.
	
✓	</a>: This is your closing tag, marking that 
the hyperlink is closed.
Formatting words
Adding simple formatting to words is, well, simple. Use an opening tag, fol­
lowed by the text you want to format, and then finish with a closing tag. You 
can format words, sentences, or even entire paragraphs.
Here’s what the code looks like:
	
✓	Bold: <strong>This is bold text.</strong>
	
✓	Italics: <em>This is italics or emphasized text.</em>
	
✓	Strikethrough: <del>This is strikethrough or deleted 
text.</del>
You can see each of these formatting 
options in action in Figure 9-2.
	
Using strikethrough formatting 
doesn’t delete any text. Bloggers 
often use strikethrough text to 
acknowledge an error, to cross out 
outdated information within a post, 
or to show humor or irony.
Avoid applying underline to words on the Internet. Users assume that under­
lined words are hyperlinks, which may be confusing even if your hyperlinks 
are a different color and not even underlined.
Figure 9-1: Blue text signals 
hyperlinked words.
Figure 9-2: Different types of text formatted 
with HTML.

159
 Chapter 9: Customizing the Design with Coding Basics
Making lists
Lists take the form of numbered or bulleted lists. However, HTML doesn’t 
think in terms of numbered or bulleted; instead, it thinks in terms of ordered 
and unordered lists:
	
✓	Ordered list: Numbered items
	
✓	Unordered list: Bulleted items
Makes sense, right?
When making a list, you use two types of tags to create a list: a starting and 
closing pair that begins and ends the list and denotes the list type (ordered 
or unordered). Within the list, subordinate tags denote the listed items.
For ordered lists, you use the main <ol> and </ol> (ordered list) tags with 
<li> (list item) tags inside. For unordered lists, you use <ul> and </ul> 
(unordered list) and <li> (list item) tags. As you can see in the following 
examples, you use a <li> and a </li> tag to denote each listed item, regard­
less of the type of list.
<ol>
   <li>I came.</li>
   <li>I saw.</li>
   <li>I conquered (this book).</li>
</ol>
<ul>
   <li>I came.</li>
   <li>I saw.</li>
   <li>I conquered (this book).</li>
</ul>
In Figure 9-3, you see that just the 
difference between an o and a u 
changes the list from a numbered to 
a bulleted list.
	
Don’t forget to use closing tags with 
your lists. If you forget to close the 
list with an </ol> or </ul>, a web 
browser assumes that all the content 
underneath the opening tag is part of 
the list.
Figure 9-3: Ordered and unordered lists.

160
Part II: Choosing the Visual Design Elements 
Inserting images
Great blog designs have one thing in common: They use images. Placing 
images into a blog post, sidebar, or other place just takes a little bit of HTML.
To display your image online, your image must be hosted on a server. For 
example, if you’re working in WordPress.org, your image is uploaded to your 
server, and from there you can display the image by pointing to the image 
file, including your blog address and the subfolder (if applicable) where 
images are stored. To display images, HTML uses an <img> tag with an src 
attribute (src as in the image source, which in this case means the image’s 
address online), like this:
<img src=”http://www.blogname.com/location-of-image/
imagefilename.jpg”/>
	
With proper permission, you can also source images that aren’t your own. 
For example, an advertiser running a banner ad on your blog might want to 
host that ad on its website. Because you’re sourcing the image from that site, 
the advertiser could update the banner ad, which then automatically updates 
on your blog (provided the ad provider didn’t change the location of the 
image on its server).
To turn the image into a link so that clicking it takes a visitor to a URL, place 
the <img> tag inside a hyperlink tag, like so:

Making images clickable comes in especially handy when you want to con­
nect a social media icon (which is typically an image file) to a social media 
profile page.
Finally, adding an alt tag description to your image code gives search 
engines a way to know what the image contains. The alt description also 
makes your web page accessible to people who use special devices (which 
read the text in the alt description aloud) because they have a disability, 
such as limited vision or blindness. To use an alt tag with your image, use 
alt=”Image File Description” like this:
<img src=”http://www.blogname.com/subfolder/
imagefilename.jpg” alt=”Image File Description” />
I talk more about the benefits of using alt tags in Chapter 10.

To put this all together, if you’d like to display a Facebook icon (stored within 
a subfolder on your server) whose filename is fbicon.png and have the 
icon linked to your Facebook page (http://www.facebook.com/mypage), 
your link and <img> tag look like this:
<a href=”http://www.facebook.com/mypage”>
   <img src=”http://www.momcomm.com/images/fgicon.png” />

Basic CSS Every Blogger Should Know
Most bloggers have touched HTML at some point, but CSS remains a little 
more mysterious to someone just getting familiar with code. Your CSS lives 
within a file called a style sheet, usually named style.css. Some blogs may 
have more than one CSS file.
The following sections help you get some basic CSS under your belt so you 
can change the style of some blog design elements yourself.
	
If you have trouble finding the code for any of these, try Firebug, which I 
explain how to use later in this chapter.
Changing background color
One of the simplest changes to make in your CSS is changing the background 
color. In Chapter 8, I mention that themes let you change your overall back­
ground color in the theme settings. Easy!
If you don’t have that option, it’s time to dig into your CSS file. Not only can 
you change your overall background color, but you can also change the 
background of other elements in your blog design, such as the space behind 
your text.
To change your main background color, look for this code:
body {
   background: #FFFFFF;
}
Using the hex code #FFFFFF makes the background white. Just update the 
hex code to change the color. (See Chapter 6 for more about hex codes and 
how they work.)

162
Part II: Choosing the Visual Design Elements 
Adjusting other colors
Just like the background color, you can also adjust any color by finding the 
corresponding CSS code and then changing the hex code color. For example, 
to change the color of your main headings (like your blog post titles), look for 
the h1 selector, which applies formatting to the largest heading on your blog. 
Then simply adjust the hex color code (currently #0000FF) to whatever you 
want:
h1 {
   font-size: 18px;
   color: #0000FF;
   font-weight: bold;
}
	
In looking through code, you sometimes might see hex colors written as a 
three-digit code. Because hex (hexadecimal) codes are a set of three, two-digit 
sets, when the two characters in each set are the same, you can shorten the 
hex code by removing the duplicate character. In the preceding example, 
the blue color #0000FF can also be written as #00F.
Changing font properties
When you work on a blog post and want to format certain smallish things — 
say, apply bold to a word — you do this within your text editor or by using 
HTML. But if you want broader changes — say, change the font size for all 
your blog posts, or make every blog post title bold — you make blanket 
changes to the font in a particular page element by using CSS. Table 9-1 lays 
out some frequently used font properties and their values.
Table 9-1	
Font Properties in CSS
Property
Common Values
font-family
verdana, serif
font-size
em, px, %
(Note: In the context of sizing fonts, em is a measure­
ment relative to the current font size. So, 2em is twice 
the size of the current font size.)
font-style
normal, italic
font-weight
normal, bold, bolder, lighter

163
 Chapter 9: Customizing the Design with Coding Basics
Here’s an example of how you would use these properties together to change 
a particular font:
font-family: trebuchet MS;
font-size: 16px;
font-style: normal;
font-weight: bold;
font-style and font-weight are self-explanatory. However font-family 
and font-size (such as using the Trebuchet MS font with a size of 16 pixels, 
as shown in the preceding code) need a little more explanation.
Font-family
As I explain in Chapter 6, only certain fonts work on the web. So, when listing 
the font family you want to use, always include fallback options, separated by 
a comma. That way, if your first choice doesn’t render correctly for a visitor, 
that browser tries the next font you’ve specified (assuming that you did — and 
you should!). Ending with a generic font (serif, sans-serif, monospace) 
ensures that the browser will select a similar font if the font families preceding 
it fail.
Here’s an example:
font-family: Georgia, “Times New Roman”, serif;
In the preceding example, the browser will first try the font Georgia. If that 
fails, then it tries Times New Roman. If that fails too, then the browser will 
use any font that’s a serif font.
	
Always use quotation marks to list a font family with more than one word, 
like what I did for Times New Roman in the preceding example.
Font-size
The font-size property sets the text size. If not specified, the default text 
size in browsers is 16px. The size of the text can be listed in one of four ways:
	
✓	px: px is a measurement in pixels (dots on a computer screen), with 
larger numbers representing larger text sizes and smaller numbers 
displaying smaller text. 
	
✓	em: em is a unit of measurement equal to a specified font size. If the element 
you want to change is set at 16 px, then 1 em = 16 px. So, if you want to 
make the text bigger, a text size of 2.5em would make it 40 px.

164
Part II: Choosing the Visual Design Elements 
	
✓	%: Like using em, using a percentage (%) is also based off the <body> 
size. With the <body> size listed at 100%, a heading might be 120%, and 
a smaller bit of text might be 75%.
	
✓	pt: A point (pt) is 1⁄72 of an inch and is typically used for print typogra­
phy. If you defined a font size for a website using points, a 14-pt font size 
might look larger or smaller than you intended because an inch is an 
inch is an inch.
	
	Avoid using point sizes in your blog design.
Aligning text
Online text can be aligned to the left or the right, centered, justified, or inher­
ited (taking the same value of the element’s parent). Within your CSS, you 
can apply this alignment to any text element from a heading tag (like <h1>) 
to your paragraphs. The following CSS rules show you the ways you can align 
a paragraph:
p {text-align: center;}
p {text-align: left;}
p {text-align: right;}
p {text-align: justify;}
p {text-align: inherit;}
Adjusting margins and padding
Before I get to the nitty-gritty about margins and padding, you should under­
stand a little about how they fit into the bigger picture. In HTML, each blog 
design element is considered a box. Each box includes a content area (such 
as a blog post title or a blog graphic) surrounded by optional margins, bor­
ders, and padding. Each of those form a box around the element. In CSS, the 
box model refers to those boxes generated by the optional margins, borders, 
and padding.
In this section, I want to talk only about margins and padding because blog­
gers often confuse the two. (At first, I did, too.) Here’s the easiest way to 
explain the difference:
	
✓	Margin: The outer space of an element
	
✓	Padding: The inner space of an element

165
 Chapter 9: Customizing the Design with Coding Basics
To put that into visual terms, take 
a look at Figure 9-4. Notice how the 
padding adds space around the con­
tent area but stays within the border 
as part of the element. Margins create 
whitespace outside the content.
Margins and padding can be adjusted 
to the top, bottom, right, and left 
of an image. Because padding adds 
space within the element, note that it 
increases that element’s size as well. 
So, an element that’s 200px wide 
with 10px of padding on both the right and left sides will become 220 pixels.
Sometimes you see padding or margins written in shorthand so the coding 
doesn’t get too lengthy. For example, this code
padding: 10px 20px 30px 40px;
and this code
padding-top: 10px;
padding-right: 20px;
padding-bottom: 30px;
padding-left: 40px;
mean the same thing. If you notice, listing margins and padding go in a clock­
wise order starting with 12 o’clock. 
Code can even become shorter. For example, this code
margin: 10px 20px;
means the top and bottom are 10px, and the right and left are 20px.
Styling links
In the earlier section, “Inserting hyperlinks,” I show you how to use HTML 
to link text to a location or file. CSS lets you style that text depending on the 
state the link is in.
Links typically use these four selector options:
	
✓	a:link selects a link that hasn’t been visited.
	
✓	a:visited selects a link that the user has visited.
Figure 9-4: A design or text element can be 
surrounded by padding, a border, and margins.

166
Part II: Choosing the Visual Design Elements 
	
✓	a:hover selects the link state when the user runs a cursor over it.
	
✓	a:active selects a link that becomes active the moment it’s clicked.
	
The order of these link state selectors is important for the code to work. The 
a:hover selector must come after a:link and a:visited. The a:active 
selective must come after a:hover.
Hyperlinks often use underlines, but you can remove the underline in vari­
ous states by using text-decoration: none. Here’s an example of how 
to code a not-underlined link that’s been visited so that the link turns purple 
with no underline:
a:visited {color: #800080; text-decoration: none;}
Accessing the CSS in Your Blogging Platform
As for exactly how to access your blog’s CSS, it really depends on the blog 
platform you use. Here’s how to access your CSS file or CSS options in a few 
of the most popular blogging platforms:
	
✓	Blogger: To modify your CSS in Blogger, you really don’t have to 
touch too much code. Blogger actually gives you customization 
options such as changing fonts and colors of various blog elements. 
To access these options, open your Blogger Dashboard and go to 
Template➪Customize➪Advanced. If you can’t do exactly what you want 
from the existing options, then you can add CSS by selecting Add CSS 
from the Advanced menu options. 
	
✓	Tumblr: Tumblr allows you to add to the existing CSS. Click Customize 
in the top right of your screen. Then, in a customization toolbar, click 
Advanced to add CSS in the Add Custom CSS field.
	
	The Firebug tool really comes in handy for blog platforms where you can’t 
modify the code but only add new code that overrides the code that 
already exists. You find out how to use this tool later in this chapter.
	
✓	Wordpress.com: Because Wordpress.com hosts your blog for you, 
you have to purchase its Custom Design upgrade to modify the CSS. 
(Chapter 1 explains the difference between hosted and self-hosted 
blogs.) You can find more information about upgrading at the follow­
ing web address: http://en.support.wordpress.com/custom-
design/editing-css
	
✓	Wordpress.org: To modify CSS on a Wordpress.org blog, you need 
to access your themes style.css file. From your Dashboard, go to 
Appearance➪Editor. You can find the style.css file under your 
theme’s templates on the right side. You can also edit your CSS from 
your host’s control panel or via FTP (File Transfer Protocol).

167
 Chapter 9: Customizing the Design with Coding Basics
	
	When using WordPress frameworks (like those I cover in Chapter 7), do 
not modify the CSS of the framework. Instead, modify the style.css 
file for your child theme. Most frameworks warn you within the frame­
work’s style.css file, but it’s worth mentioning here too.
Inspecting Your Blog with Firebug
Ever since a friend introduced me to the wonders of Firebug, it’s been one 
of my favorite tools. Firebug (http://getfirebug.com) is a free web-
development tool that integrates with the Firefox browser. Firebug lets you 
look at your blog design and your code at the same time. Think of it as having 
X-ray vision! However, the coolest part is that you can make changes to your 
design in real time, yet the changes don’t affect your live blog. That means 
you can play, learn, tweak, and code without worrying about a thing!
To set up Firebug, you need to use the Mozilla Firefox browser. There are a 
few ways to install Firebug but here’s the most straightforward way.
	
1.	Visit the Firebug page on the Mozilla Add-Ons site: http://addons.
mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firebug
	
2.	Click the Add to Firefox button. 
	
	 A popup displays telling you to install add-ons only from authors whom 
you trust.
	
3.	Click Install Now from the popup window.
	
	 A message displays saying Firebug is now installed. The installation also 
adds a Firebug symbol onto your browser toolbar (Figure 9-5).
	
	 To start using Firebug, click the Firebug icon or press F12.
Figure 9-5: Firebug icon appears on your Firefox toolbar.

168
Part II: Choosing the Visual Design Elements 
Firebug can do a host of awesome things, but I like to use the tool for three 
purposes:
	
✓	Find what code affects which part of your design or content. Firebug 
lets you inspect your blog’s HTML and CSS. If you want to find out how 
to change a particular element’s color but don’t know which code to 
modify, click the rectangle-with-a-cursor-arrow icon beside the bug to 
inspect any element on your page. In Figure 9-6, I hovered over my blog 
header image, and Firebug tells me details about the HTML and the style 
(or CSS) of the element. I can see where my header image is sourced 
from, and under the Style tab, I see that my image has no border. The 
tool even tells me which line of the CSS I need to modify if I really want 
to make changes on my blog.
	
✓	See how changes look (without really making them). Firebug makes 
your blog a coding playground. Change colors, play with sizes, and 
adjust margins all you want. Nothing is altered in your live blog because 
you’re not actually changing an actual HTML document or a CSS file. 
In Figure 9-7, I played with the CSS by changing the hex code color of 
my comment bubble from gray to green, just to see how it looks. (Read 
more about hex codes in Chapter 6.)
	
✓	Find out the size of various blog elements. If you’re unsure of a blog 
design element’s size, use the inspector tool and then click Layout in the 
right window. For example, I click the sidebar column in the visual pane 
at the top and then click the Layout tab in the lower right pane of the 
Firebug window. On the Layout tab, Firebug tells me my sidebar is 
currently 188 pixels (px) wide and 532 px high.
Figure 9-6: Use Firebug to see the code of an element.

169
 Chapter 9: Customizing the Design with Coding Basics
Figure 9-7: Play with color changes in Firebug.
	
Firebug doesn’t actually save any changes to your actual code. If you’re 
exploring several tweaks to your code with Firebug, make notes of your modi­
fications so you can then make them within your actual live code.

o matter how awesomely designed a blog looks, visitors won’t stick 
around if a blog is hard to navigate. A blog should be easy for visitors 
to move through, whether they just want to explore your blog or need to find 
something specific.
The next few chapters cover various aspects of making your blog easy to nav­
igate, and this chapter first gives you a foundation of good navigation design 
by explaining how both you and your readers benefit. In addition, I cover 
ways to optimize your blog to bring in new readers from search engines. 
Finally, I cover a few ways to ensure that your blog is easy to navigate on 
mobile devices.
Discovering the Mission of Good Navigation
You may write wonderfully thought-provoking blog posts, but all the best 
writing in the world does you little good if your readers have to think too 
hard when it comes to moving around your blog. Good navigation as part of 
your blog design means that visitors can move through your site intuitively. 
They don’t need help figuring it out because the navigation all makes sense.
I have to break something to you, though. Good navigation design means roll­
ing up your sleeves and putting in some extra work. You may have to spend 
time trimming your blog categories (see Chapter 12) or making your site 
mobile-friendly, but the benefits are well worth the digital elbow grease.

174
Part III: Designing for Easy Navigation and Interactivity 
Staying focused on your readers
Making decisions about how to best lay out your navigation design boils 
down to simply putting yourself in readers’ shoes. Focus on the readers’ 
experience by thinking of scenarios where a reader may end up navigating to 
or through your blog. Here are a few typical examples:
	
✓	A visitor performs a search on a search engine that leads to your blog.
	
✓	A visitor navigates directly to your blog and wants to read multiple 
posts from a particular category.
	
✓	A visitor clicks a link on someone else’s blog that leads to a post or page 
within your blog.
	
✓	After exploring your blog a bit, a visitor wants to return to a page he or 
she already visited on your blog.
	
Good navigation allows blog visitors to get around your site easily, whether 
they’re looking for something specific or just exploring.
When it comes to a visitor finding content or information, keep this simple 
rule in mind: People shouldn’t have to click more than three times to find 
what they’re looking for. While an old but well-known study from Joshua 
Porter (“Testing the Three-Click Rule,” User Interface Engineering, origi­
nally published April 16, 2003, http://www.uie.com/articles/three_
click_rule/) showed that people don’t necessarily give up after three 
magical clicks, the point remains — the reader shouldn’t have to click too 
many times to get to a destination.
Staying focused on readers also means encouraging them to read more than 
one blog post. You can drive readers to other posts through related post 
links, a popular post section, and more. I cover these techniques in the next 
few chapters.
	
In Chapter 3, I talk about knowing the types of users who visit your blog. Put 
yourself into the shoes of each of your reader types and decide how you can 
get them to the content you think they care about. You could even ask some 
friends or blog readers to serve as “beta testers” to see how intuitive (or not) 
the navigation is on your blog. 
Limiting choice to drive action
As a blogger, you want to make your readers happy. In that quest, sometimes 
bloggers (and businesses, for that matter) try to be helpful by giving readers 
a lot of choices — subscription options, menu options, sharing options — 
hoping that they can cater to as many readers as possible. If you’re a blogger 
who does this, you may want to reconsider how many choices you give your 
readers because giving people too many choices can backfire. 

175
 Chapter 10: Navigation and SEO Basics
Sheena Iyengar and Mark Lepper published an often-cited study that makes 
this point (“When Choice Is Demotivating: Can One Desire Too Much of a Good 
Thing?” Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 49, no. 6 [2000]). The 
researchers and their assistants set up a table in a gourmet market and offered 
samples of different types of jam to passersby. Every few hours, the research 
team switched from offering 24 samples of jams to just 6 samples. Customers 
tried two jams on average, regardless of how many jams presented to them. 
Each person who sampled a jam received a coupon good for $1 off one jam.
Now here’s where the number of jams comes into play. More people (60 per­
cent) stopped by the assortment of 24 jams, yet just 40 percent were drawn 
in to a display of just six jams. However, 30 percent of those who sampled 
from the small assortment purchased the jam, whereas a mere 3 percent of 
those presented with 24 jams purchased a jar! When presented with fewer 
choices, people were more likely to buy.
The same principle goes beyond jam. When you offer fewer choices on your 
blog, readers are more likely to take action. This means instead of showing 
readers 10 or 15 social media platforms you belong to, just show the ones 
that matter the most to you — and that your readers use most.
	
Offering choice is a matter of keeping things organized and not overwhelming. 
Think about what you really, really need before you add more choices to 
your blog. Throughout the next few chapters, I talk about some ways to limit 
choice and clutter so readers can more easily use and navigate your site.
Easing Navigation with SEO-optimized 
Blog Components
Search engine optimization (SEO) essentially describes the process of increas­
ing a website’s visibility in a search engine’s unpaid search results. SEO can 
help bring your blog to the attention of people using a search engine to find 
specific information. Say you write a post about how to plan a superhero 
birthday party. You surely hope that later, when someone types “superhero 
birthday party” into a search engine, your post shows up on the first page of 
results. This can bring you a lot of traffic, which any blogger would love.
Optimizing your blog doesn’t mean that you’ll rise to the top of the rankings. 
There are no guarantees in the world of SEO! But doing some basic SEO can 
make your site easier to get to from search engines than doing no SEO at all. 
The better you optimize your blog, the more likely you can bring people to 
your site via search engines.
	
SEO isn’t about tricking search engines or writing keyword-stuffed blog posts. 
Instead, making simple adjustments to a few parts of your blog can optimize 
your content and attract new readers.

176
Part III: Designing for Easy Navigation and Interactivity 
This section won’t make you an SEO ninja, maven, or any other overused 
word. What it will do is teach you a few basic tricks to improve your blog’s 
search engine visibility.
Building a sitemap
Websites often have two types of sitemaps — one mainly for search engines 
and one mainly for blog visitors.
An XML sitemap is a directory of pages that you want search engines to find. 
Think of it as a file that helps search engines learn about your entire blog. 
Without an XML sitemap, search engines will still most likely find your blog. 
Using the sitemap just supplements that.
One of the easiest ways to do this is through a WordPress.org plug-in. After 
you find and install an XML sitemap plug-in, the plug-in actually does most of 
the work for you.
To create a sitemap, install the Google XML Sitemaps plug-in:
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/google-sitemap-
generator
Then follow these steps:
	
1.	Go to Settings➪XML-Dashboard.
	
	Leave the options selected as they are.
	
2.	Generate your sitemap for the first time by clicking the Click Here to 
Build It for the First Time link (at the top).
	
3.	To see your finished sitemap, click the Sitemap link in the first sen­
tence at the top of the page.
	
	You can see an example of an XML sitemap in Figure 10-1.
	
If you use an SEO plug-in like I cover in the upcoming section, “Getting spe­
cific with a meta description,” check whether the plug-in includes an XML 
sitemap as a feature.
As you can see in Figure 10-1, an XML sitemap may be search engine–friendly, 
but it’s not user-friendly. For your blog visitors, you want to create an HTML 
sitemap or an archive page. Because most bloggers have archive pages 
rather than HTML sitemaps, I talk more about making archive pages in 
Chapter 12.

177
 Chapter 10: Navigation and SEO Basics
Figure 10-1: An XML sitemap in WordPress.
Creating proper headings
Headings help your blog readers digest content. As I mention in Chapter 4, 
within your blog’s HTML, your headers are defined from h1 (the largest head­
ing size) to h6 (the smallest heading size). As you can guess, larger headers 
signify more important content.
From a navigation design perspective, headings give your reader — as well as 
search engines — clues as to what’s important on the page. Search engines 
weight the words in header tags as more important than the smaller words of 
your main content.
On a blog post, your headers for a blog post typically go like this:
	
✓	h1: Blog post title
	
✓	h2: Subheadings
	
✓	h3: Deeper subheadings to support h2 subheadings
	
Bloggers don’t need to use h4, h5, or h6 too often, if at all. Ideally, don’t skip 
headings levels — like going from h1 to h3 on a blog post — and use relevant 
keywords in your headings to help search engines know what the post is 
about.
To add a heading level to your blog post, go to your Visual Editor. In 
WordPress, the place to change the heading level looks like what I show in 
Figure 10-2. If you don’t see the menu that lets you select a heading, click the 
Show/Hide Kitchen Sink icon (it looks like two stacked boxes containing dots 
and dashes).

178
Part III: Designing for Easy Navigation and Interactivity 
Figure 10-2: In WordPress, select heading levels here.
	
Using headings also helps with blog post readability, which I talk more about 
in Chapter 16.
Using an effective title tag
Your blog’s title tag gives the search engine (and a reader visiting a search 
engine) a description about your blog. When someone lands on your blog, 
a visitor sees the contents of the title tag in the title bar and/or tab at the 
top of their browser windows, as shown in Figure 10-3. Technically, the title 
tag is an actual HTML tag that tells your browser what text to display in the 
browser window’s title bar and tab. However, you probably filled out the con­
tents of this tag via a visual interface in your blogging platform.
Figure 10-3: A home page’s title tag uses keywords to describe a blog.
Good navigation within your blog design means fine-tuning areas that may at 
first look like small details, like title tags. When you look at where the title tag 
displays in a search engine, you can see how important it really is. Figure 10-4 
shows you how a title tag looks when your blog comes up in a search. The 
title tag is the text after the blog name Momcomm.

179
 Chapter 10: Navigation and SEO Basics
Figure 10-4: How a title tag looks in a search engine. 
Unless you edit your code, the location to add your blog’s title tag varies by blog 
platform. In WordPress, you can find the field under Settings➪General➪Tagline.
To see how the title tag looks in a WordPress dashboard, see Figure 10-5. 
Notice there’s no section called “title tag.” The title tag is the Tagline field. 
Many WordPress themes fill in the field with something generic like “Just 
Another WordPress Blog.” 
Figure 10-5: In WordPress, the text you enter in the Tagline field appears 
in the HTML title tag.

180
Part III: Designing for Easy Navigation and Interactivity 
	
Trying to write something for the Tagline field can be tricky because you 
have to squeeze everything about your blog into a short statement. This field 
doesn’t necessarily have to use your blog’s actual tagline. (Read more about 
taglines in Chapter 8.) If your tagline is cute or clever but doesn’t include rel­
evant keywords, your title tag won’t help with SEO. Instead, stick with these 
two simple guidelines:
	
✓	Use a phrase that best describes your blog. Search engines likely place 
greater weight on words at the beginning than at the end, so put the 
more important keywords closer to the beginning of the sentence.
	
✓	Keep it short so search engines don’t cut off words. Using about 70 
characters or fewer works best.
If you don’t really have a niche, you might be thinking how you can sum up 
your entire blog into a short title. As a workaround, you could include a loca­
tion (“blogging mom from Raleigh”) or title (“freelance writer”).
Title tags for your home page also go beyond your blog’s home page. 
Effective SEO means ensuring search engine–worthy blog posts and pages 
have their own title tags. Blogging platforms automatically make a blog post 
or page’s title its title tag (although you might customize it at times).
Getting specific with a meta description
Meta, whata? A meta description is a short paragraph that search engines use 
to describe your entire blog, a page, or a blog post.
One important component of search engine optimization is letting readers 
know where they’re going. Although search engines don’t use meta descrip­
tions to determine your rankings, a proper meta description reassures search 
engine users that they are indeed headed to a page that has what they’re 
searching for.
In Figure 10-6, you can see a search result for Twitter Name Change Checklist. 
Since I added a meta description to my blog post (I explain how to do so later 
in this section), that description displays in black text after the date the post 
was published. The meta description for my blog post on this topic rein­
forces to the visitors searching that the post is relevant to them.
Without a meta description for 
your blog posts or pages, search 
engines pull the first sentences from 
your post or page. Without a meta 
description for your overall site, 
Figure 10-6: How a meta description appears 
in Google.

181
 Chapter 10: Navigation and SEO Basics
search engines pull the first sentences from your most recent blog post, 
which may not be relevant to your blog overall. Say you started a post with 
something like, “I’m so happy to be back from vacation,” but your blog is 
about cooking and sharing recipes.
	
When writing meta descriptions, be sure to use relevant keywords and keep 
the description to 150 characters. A meta description can be longer, but 
search engines show only a certain number of characters and then show an 
ellipsis to note there is more.
In Blogger, you can add a meta description for your entire blog by going to 
Settings➪Search Preferences➪Meta Tags➪Description, and then clicking 
Edit to enter your description. To change the meta description for individual 
posts or pages, go to your Post Editor and then click Search Description 
under Post Settings.
As for WordPress.org, the default installation doesn’t include meta descrip­
tion data. If you don’t want to add a meta description directly into your 
HTML files, the easiest way to add a meta description for your overall blog 
and for individual posts is to use a theme that has settings for meta descrip­
tions or to use a plug-in.
For example, in the Genesis theme, you can add your blog’s meta description 
under SEO Settings. (Read more about themes in Chapter 5.) Genesis adds a 
Theme SEO Settings section under each post and page so that you can enter 
those meta descriptions.
If your theme doesn’t come with SEO options, check out these three popular 
(and free) WordPress SEO plug-ins:
	
✓	WordPress SEO plug-in by Yoast
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-seo
	
✓	WordPress All-in-One SEO Pack
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/all-in-one-seo-pack
	
✓	SEO Ultimate
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/seo-ultimate
These plug-ins all make it easy for you to optimize your site and your posts. 
In Figure 10-7, you can see how the plug-in WordPress SEO (by Yoast) makes 
it easy for you to optimize your blog posts for SEO by showing you a Snippet 
Preview and giving you character counts for SEO Title (title tag) and meta 
description.

Figure 10-7: Optimize SEO for a blog post.
	
If you don’t care about optimizing certain posts (like a post about your birth­
day), don’t worry about adding meta descriptions to those posts. Optimize 
the ones with search engine ranking potential.
Making permalinks friendly
Just as your blog design should be clean, so should the URLs for all your 
pages and posts. These URLs — permalinks — link directly to a page or post 
instead of your blog’s main URL. Search engines use the words within a per­
malink to help classify your page, so the better optimized your permalink is, 
the more quality visitors your page attracts.
The permalink structure options for your blog posts depend upon the blog 
platform. For Blogger, the default permalink structure uses the post date 
like so:
http://blogname.blogspot.com/2013/01/blog-post-title.html
For WordPress.org, the default structure looks like this:
http://www.blogname.com/?p=123
Note: The WordPress.org default isn’t great from a navigation perspective 
because the link format says nothing about the post. That means your URL 
isn’t helpful in telling the search engines (or people) about the page’s con­
tent. Luckily, you have a lot of options in WordPress (check out Figure 10-8).

183
 Chapter 10: Navigation and SEO Basics
Figure 10-8: Set permalink options here.
To change your permalink settings in WordPress.org, stick to the Post Name 
option or the slightly longer Month and Name option. Both choices give your 
reader a descriptive permalink. While Month and Name permalinks are a 
common choice among bloggers, just note that this format might deter some 
people from visiting really old posts. 
When you change your permalink structure, you need to set up a 301 redirect, 
which is a permanent redirect to a new permalink. That way, you don’t have 
to worry about broken links if another website linked to your blog using the 
structure in place before you changed your permalinks. You can set up the 
redirect with a WordPress plug-in like Redirection (http://wordpress.
org/extend/plugins/redirection) or, if you feel like getting into code, 
by following the instructions from the WordPress.org Codex site (http://
codex.wordpress.org/Using_Permalinks).
If another website links to your blog, this external link can help boost your 
search engine rankings. Search engines assume that the more sites that link 
to you — your home page, blog post, or page — the more relevant your con­
tent is for a particular search term. From an SEO standpoint, a 301 redirect 
passes between 90 and 99 percent of that page’s link power — affectionately 
called link juice — to the new permalink.
If you don’t want to change your entire permalink structure, you can change 
just individual posts and pages when needed. In fact, your blog post or page 

184
Part III: Designing for Easy Navigation and Interactivity 
title and your permalink name don’t need to match exactly. For example your 
About page permalink might include a specific name, like this:
blogname.com/about-firstname-lastname
That specific name makes the permalink a bit more descriptive than a perma­
link with only the word about at the end, like this:
blogname.com/about
A more specific permalink is more SEO-friendly for those visitors who might 
search you by name. If you have a long blog post title, you can adjust the per­
malink to be more focused on a keyword versus using a full title.
To change a single post or page on Blogger
	
1.	Create a new post or page.
	
2.	Choose Post Settings➪Permalink.
	
3.	Make sure that Custom URL is selected and then enter your custom 
permalink.
	
4.	Click Done when finished.
	
When you change a permalink on a Blogger post or page that’s already been 
published, the original link doesn’t redirect to your new permalink. For this 
reason, change only permalinks that are still new (fewer people are aware of 
the URL) or that haven’t been published yet.
To change a single post or page in WordPress.org
	
1.	Go to the post or page.
	
2.	Click Edit beside the permalink (located underneath the Blog Post 
Title field).
	
3.	Make your change in the field and then click OK to save.
When changing a single previously published URL, Wordpress.org keeps both 
the old and the new permalink working.
Adding alt attributes and titles to images
alt attributes — alternative text — display as an alternative when an image 
can’t be seen for some reason, such as a slow Internet connection having 

185
 Chapter 10: Navigation and SEO Basics
trouble loading an image. However, 
alt attributes carry even more 
importance than that from an SEO 
and navigation design perspective.
Search engines can’t see images, so 
adding an alt attribute to each of 
your images tells the search engine 
what your image is about. In Figure 
10-9, you can see that the Alternative 
Text field appears when you add an 
image in WordPress.org.
In the HTML for the image, the alt 
attribute appears in the image tag 
and looks like this (see the bold 
text):
<img 
   src=”http://www.yoursite.com/images/filename.jpg” 
   alt=”Costa Rica butterfly”
/>
	
Whether images are part of your blog design or a blog post, include relevant 
keywords in your alt attribute so that search engines can find them easier. 
Sometimes a search engine user might navigate to your blog by finding an 
image first and then want to read the post. For example, someone might do 
an image search for crocheted blankets and then click an image that leads to 
a blog post with full instructions on how to make the blanket. Other times, 
the alt attribute just gives search engines a bigger picture of what topic is 
covered on a particular post or page. Bottom line: The more complete the 
picture that a search engine has about your blog, the more you’ve convinced 
the search engine that your blog post or page really covers the topic being 
searched.
alt attributes also aid in navigation by enabling people with blindness or 
impaired vision to identify what images appear on your site. Assistive devices 
then read text in the alt attribute aloud.
Notice in Figure 10-9 the Title field. When someone hovers over an image, 
that title description text appears (if the image has one). Although a title 
description can provide additional information about a photo, that info is 
more important from a user perspective, not for a search engine.
	
However, a title description is quite important if your blog readers use 
Pinterest. When someone pins a post of yours using a PinIt bookmarklet 
installed on their browser, the bookmarklet pulls up the title description 
Figure 10-9: Blog platforms allow you to easily 
add an alt attribute description.

186
Part III: Designing for Easy Navigation and Interactivity 
from the image you select to pin. Pinterest uses your image title as the pin 
description. Without the description, Pinterest pulls the filename of the 
image, which may not be a helpful description. I talk more about naming 
images in Chapter 15.
Getting specific using anchor text
Anchor text is a clickable word or phrase within your blog that’s hyperlinked 
to a web page. Say I wrote a blog post and linked to another blog post with 
the words Facebook guidelines. The words Facebook guidelines is anchor text.
On the backend, the HTML for a link looks like this (the anchor text is in bold):
<a href=”http://www.momcomm.com/facebook-guidelines”>
Facebook guidelines</a>
Anchor text can help boost how you rank within search engines because 
search engine spiders use it to determine what your page is about. Anchor 
text is important to interlinking, which occurs when you link to other pages 
or posts within your own site.
To understand why anchor text is so important, have you ever linked to a 
post using words like this? (Pretend that the underlined words are links.)
	
✓	I wrote about that here.
	
✓	My last post on crazy hamster tricks.
	
✓	For more information, click here.
Most bloggers have done this at one time or another because it’s sometimes 
the easiest thing to do. However, choosing generic words as the anchor text 
doesn’t help your blog’s search engine rankings. That’s because generic 
anchor text doesn’t describe the page content. Your blog’s navigation design 
suffers, too, because blog readers need descriptive anchor text that compels 
them to click through.
Say you wrote a post about making homemade pizza. You write another blog 
post and want to mention your homemade pizza recipe post. To entice your 
readers to navigate to your other post, consider which of the following is 
more compelling:
	
✓	I wrote this great post about making homemade pizza.
	
✓	I wrote this great post about making homemade pizza.
Yup, they are indeed the same sentence, but the second one uses more 
descriptive anchor text. Not only is using anchor text a good SEO tactic, but 

187
 Chapter 10: Navigation and SEO Basics
it also encourages your readers to actually click the link, which for internal 
links will give you higher page views and a lower bounce rate. (See Chapter 3 
for more about those terms.)
Sometimes you may have to rearrange your sentence to make anchor text 
work, but for the most part, using anchor text flows naturally in a sentence.
	
The same rules about anchor text apply when you link to other blogs and 
websites from your own blog. With more specific anchor text, you can play a 
part in helping a fellow blogger rank better for a specific term.
Making Your Blog Mobile-Friendly
The Internet is a different place than it was even a few short years ago. 
According to the Pew Internet & American Life Project, as of 2012, 56 percent 
of cellphone owners use their device to access the Internet (see http://
pewinternet.org/Commentary/2012/February/Pew-Internet-
Mobile.aspx). This means quite a few of your readers, even first-time 
visitors, visit your blog on a mobile device.
Because mobile devices have smaller screens than laptop or desktop com­
puters, your blog design may not display on a phone or tablet the same way 
you see it from your computer. Your visitors may have to scroll back and 
forth on a small screen to read your content, or your design elements may 
display incorrectly.
For your blog design to engage visitors on mobile devices, you need to have 
a mobile-optimized version of your blog. With a mobile-friendly design, your 
blog’s look and feel shines through to your visitor, and visitors can read 
your blog content easily.
Responsive design
Responsive design is one of the hottest topics in blog design. The name 
refers to a website or web page’s ability to respond to the user’s screen size 
automatically.
Your blog design might not look exactly the same from computer to tablet 
to mobile device. Even two computers set to different resolutions might not 
display your blog design the same. However, a responsive design adjusts your 
blog’s design and functionality to each device. 
Responsive design works by using media queries within a web page’s CSS, 
essentially asking the device about its size and resolution. The web page layout 
then responds by changing the page layout to best suit that particular device.

188
Part III: Designing for Easy Navigation and Interactivity 
In Figure 10-10, you can see an example of responsive design. The design 
of the blog theme Karma from Theme Forest changes depending upon the 
device.
	
http://themeforest.net/item/karma-clean-and-modern-
wordpress-theme/168737
	
For a blogger, the best way to get a 
responsive design is to use a theme 
that has responsive design already 
built into it. In Chapter 7, I cover 
some places to get blog themes for 
both WordPress and Blogger. Some 
websites, like Theme Forest, offer 
responsive design themes for both 
of these blogging platforms.
Using a mobile plug-in
If your blog’s theme or template doesn’t use 
responsive design, you can use another method 
to ensure that your blog is easy to view and navi­
gate on a mobile device. Blogger uses a mobile 
template, and WordPress can do this with a 
mobile plug-in.
In Blogger, the default setting has the mobile tem­
plate turned on. To double-check, go to Template. 
The image under Mobile reads Disabled if the 
mobile template is disabled. To turn it on, click 
the icon under the mobile image and then select 
Yes, Show Mobile Template on Mobile Devices. 
You can also choose from a selection of mobile 
templates from this window.
In WordPress.org, you can use a mobile-ready 
theme or choose from many mobile plug-ins. One 
of the most popular is WPtouch:
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wptouch
Figure 10-11 shows how my blog looks with the WPtouch plug-in installed and 
adjusting my blog design for display on an iPhone. (Note that Figure 10-11 
Figure 10-10: The Karma theme from Theme 
Forest uses responsive design.
Figure 10-11: Viewing a blog 
that uses the WPtouch plug-in.

189
 Chapter 10: Navigation and SEO Basics
shows how my blog displays before I customized it. The next section explains 
how to carry design elements into your mobile design with this plug-in.)
With the basic installation, this plug-in lets readers navigate your blog with­
out having to scroll back and forth, zoom in and out, and so on.
Branding your plug-in
Most WordPress mobile plug-ins allow you to 
customize your plug-in by changing colors, adding 
a custom logo icon, and more. WPtouch allows 
you to brand your plug-in so that it complements 
your actual blog design and makes your blog 
easier to navigate. I want to walk you through a 
few fun ways you can customize your plug-in, like 
I did in Figure 10-12.
After you have installed the WPtouch plug-in, 
access your plug-in settings by doing the following:
	
1.	Go to your WordPress dashboard.
	
2.	Go to Settings➪WPtouch.
	
	 Here you see a host of options to customize 
your plug-in.
Under General Settings, make the following 
changes:
	
1.	(Optional) Change the site title if needed.
	
	 Mine read momcomm.com, so I adjusted it to just momcomm.
	
2.	To change the calendar icons beside your posts, scroll down to Post 
Listing Options.
	
	 I chose Post Thumbnails/Featured images, which pulls the featured 
image set on a blog post. If no featured image had been selected, a 
generic camera icon appears like that shown in Figure 10-12 on the Hello 
World! post. Within Post Listing Options, you can also select what infor­
mation shows below the blog post title.
	
3.	When complete, scroll to the bottom of the page and click Save Options.
To adjust colors and fonts, scroll down to Style & Color Options. Here you 
can change the background and font to one of the options available. More 
customization options are available in the Pro version.
Figure 10-12: WPtouch plug-in 
with some customized touches.

190
Part III: Designing for Easy Navigation and Interactivity 
Under Default & Custom Icon Pool is an array of icons available to use (see 
Figure 10-13). The last two (bottom row) are custom ones that I added. In this 
area, you can add custom icons to be used for your logo that displays at the 
top of the mobile page as well as icons for individual pages.
Figure 10-13: Brand your plug-in with icons.
To customize a section with a special icon, scroll to the Logo Icon/Menu 
Items & Pages Icons section. Be sure to click the Save Options button at the 
bottom of the page for your change to take effect.
To change your main logo for your design, select the desired icon from the 
first drop-down menu: Logo & Homescreen Bookmark Icon.
To change an icon for any other page, do the following:
	
1.	Go to the Pages & Icon section within the Logo Icon//Menu Items & 
Pages Icons settings.
	
2.	Place a check mark beside the page you want to customize.
	
3.	Select an icon from the drop-down menu.
	
4.	When complete, scroll to the bottom of the page and click Save 
Options.

Laying Out Your Navigation Menu 
and Sidebars
In This Chapter
▶	Creating a navigation menu

▶	Deciding what to include in your sidebar
▶	Incorporating visual elements into your sidebar
▶	Avoiding sidebar elements that distract blog visitors
Y

our navigation menu and your sidebar play a key role in your blog 
design. They’re all about helping your blog visitors navigate somewhere 
or inviting them to take action — say, visit a social media profile, subscribe 
to your blog, and then go to an archive page showing your posts in a certain 
category. The lists goes on.
So although the how-to parts of this chapter pertain to WordPress, this chap­
ter ultimately covers making smart decisions regarding your navigation menu 
and sidebar. And that applies to every blog, no matter what the platform. In 
this chapter, I cover how to decide what tabs to put in your navigation menu 
and what can go in your sidebar. Additionally, I explain how to incorporate 
your blog design into your menu and sidebar, along with what pitfalls to avoid.
Introducing Important Content 
with a Navigation Menu
A navigation menu is just what it sounds like: a menu of links that guides 
readers to other key content on your blog. A navigation menu should be 
prominently displayed on your blog; after all, you defeat the purpose of a 
navigation menu if a visitor has to search around for it. And although a navi­
gation menu should mesh with your overall blog design, the ultimate goal of 
your menu is to be functional. A simple bar with plain text is just fine as long 

192
Part III: Designing for Easy Navigation and Interactivity 
the menu serves the main purpose of helping your visitors quickly find infor­
mation they need.
In these next few sections, I guide you through how to decide on your naviga­
tion menu’s structure and content.
Deciding what content to include
Determining what content to highlight in your blog’s navigation menu ties to 
what you want to accomplish with your blog. A blogger who wants to work 
with brands (for product reviews, advertising, or partnerships) should defi­
nitely have an Advertising or a PR page in the navigation menu. (I cover what 
to include in Chapter 14.) Doing so signals to a brand representative that 
you’re interested in hearing from them. If you offer products or services, you 
want to call attention to that in your navigation menu. If you have key cat­
egories of content that you don’t want new visitors to miss, those could go in 
your navigation menu, too.
Here’s an example of what I mean. The Young House Love (www.young
houselove.com) navigation menu, displayed in Figure 11-1, showcases large 
buckets of content that guide both new and returning visitors to some of the 
blog’s most popular content as well as a link to their personal blog.
© John & Sherry Petersik, Young House Love
Figure 11-1: This navigation menu includes an About Us page and content they want 
readers to find easily.
To guide you along with the decision of what to include, start by evaluating 
the pages, categories, and content you already have (or plan to create). Then 
ask yourself two questions:
	
✓	What content and information might visitors want to access quickly?
	
✓	What content do I want readers to discover?
	
There’s no magic number as to how many menu items to include, but offering 
too many choices may overwhelm the reader. If you think you have too many, 
consider using secondary navigation or drop-down menus. You can even 
invite some friends to look at your blog and get their opinions on whether 
you have too many.

193
 Chapter 11: Laying Out Your Navigation Menu and Sidebars
	
Try using index cards (yes, little paper index cards) to aid with deciding on 
your navigation menu content, especially if you’re a larger blog or have vary­
ing types of content. Write down content topics and then start organizing 
them into a navigation menu structure.
Hint: Resist filling your navigation menu with less appealing pages, like a pri­
vacy policy or disclosure. Save those for your blog’s footer, secondary navi­
gation, or elsewhere within your blog design.
Exploring whether you need secondary navigation
Creating a navigation menu for your blog design starts off as an easy enough 
task, but after you start really thinking about what to include, you may end 
up with more menu items than you have room for. This especially holds true 
if you have a lot of content.
That’s when you need to use a secondary navigation menu, which contains 
content that (although important) doesn’t serve the primary goal of your blog.
If your content can’t be contained within a single menu, decide which menu items 
should go in the primary navigation and which should go in the secondary. Use 
the secondary navigation for the more general links, like your About page 
and Contact page.
Figure 11-2 shows one way to incorporate secondary navigation. The blog No 
Meat Athlete (www.nomeatathlete.com) splits the navigation by saving the 
primary navigation for key topics that interest the blog’s target audience. The 
secondary menu is still easy to find, but the design signifies its lesser role by 
being tucked in the upper part of the page and using smaller text than the 
main navigation menu.

Figure 11-2: This blog uses two levels of navigation to help readers find content.
Naming your tabs
Bloggers love to get clever — and clever “rules” unless it’s on your navigation 
menu. Then sorta clever and just plain rule.
A mistake that many bloggers make is to create menu items that are just too 
clever. Visitors are unofficially trained to spot pages like About Me. So, if you 

194
Part III: Designing for Easy Navigation and Interactivity 
get a little “creative” and name your About page something like The Lone 
Tomato, no one is going to know what on earth you’re talking about.
	
A navigation menu’s ultimate goal is to guide visitors throughout your blog, 
so stick to names that make sense.
Now, that doesn’t mean you have to be super-plain either. If using just vanilla 
“About” is too bland for you, you might try one of these titles instead:
	
✓	Who’s name?
	
✓	Hi! I’m name
	
✓	Meet name
	
✓	About Me
	
✓	About blog name
In addition, people love to see your personality shine through, so go ahead 
and have a little fun with your navigation menu names. Just don’t go too off-
the-wall. Whatever a menu’s title, the wording should cause the reader to 
pause and try to figure out your meaning. For example, Buy Awesome Stuff 
obviously leads to a shop of some sort.
You can also get clever through using subtitles for your navigation menu 
items. In Figure 11-3, you see that Geraldine from The Everywhereist (www.
everywhereist.com) sticks with simple titles but shows her personality 
through playful subtitles, such as About, How I got roped into this blogging 
mess. And how to contact me.
© The Everywhereist, blog design by Kimberly Coles, www.kimberlycoles.com
Figure 11-3: Navigation menus can use subtitles to add some character.
Putting Together Your Navigation Menu
After you decide what to include in your navigation menu, you’re ready to 
design the menu to become a part of your overall blog design. This section 
walks you through to design your menu.

195
 Chapter 11: Laying Out Your Navigation Menu and Sidebars
Selecting colors and fonts
In Chapter 6, I give you all the ins and outs of selecting colors and fonts for 
your overall blog design. When it comes to your navigation menu, the colors 
and font you select shouldn’t hinder the menu’s ability to aid in navigating a 
visitor to elsewhere in your blog.
The blog Simply Vintagegirl (http://www.simplyvintagegirl.com) uses 
a single-colored navigation menu along with Times New Roman font (see 
Figure 11-4). The yellow bar signifies a division from the header and the 
content, while the font choice makes the menu easy to read.
© Emily Rose Brookshire, SimplyVintagegirl.com
Figure 11-4: Use a colored navigation menu bar.
When selecting a color or colors to use for your menu bar, choose ones that 
complement your overall design. This might mean using a color you used 
within a certain design element or going with a neutral color like gray. Even 
no color at all might work if you want a simple look.
For each menu item, make sure the text and the background contrast so that 
the titles are legible. For example, using light green titles on a white back­
ground might not contrast enough, but dark green titles on a light green 
background might look just perfect.
	
When selecting fonts, simple works better. Here are two common mistakes in 
navigation menu fonts:
	
✓	Too thin: A really thin font makes the words hard to read, especially 
because navigation menus often use smaller font sizes. Choose fonts 
that don’t disappear into your background. Sometimes a thin font can 
still work if the background color provides enough contrast.
	
✓	Too fancy: A heavily scripted font or a font with lots of flair can be over­
bearing on a navigation menu. You want your menu to be readable but 
not take away the focus of your header or blog content. No matter the 
type of font, make sure it’s easy to read in smaller font sizes.

196
Part III: Designing for Easy Navigation and Interactivity 
	
Aside from font and color, watch 
that your navigation menu titles 
don’t run together and confuse your 
visitors. In the Figure 11-5, notice the 
confusing spacing between the 
words. Is it About and My Photos, or 
About My Photos? Adjust the padding 
between menu items to fix this problem. (Chapter 9 explains what you need 
to know about padding.)
To change your fonts and colors, you can often amend your theme or tem­
plate’s settings. If not, you can make these changes, as well as adjust the pad­
ding, in your style.css file. Chapter 9 introduces how to edit your CSS.
	
To find the exact code to adjust your menu and the code’s location, use 
Firebug like I talk about in Chapter 9. You can also play around with color 
and font changes before you actually make them.
Adding a simple menu
If you use WordPress.org, adding menu items — tabs — to your basic navi­
gation menu can easily be done. Just follow these steps, which may vary 
slightly depending to your theme:
	
1.	Go into your WordPress dashboard.
	
2.	Choose Appearance➪Menus.
	
	 You may have a message saying your theme doesn’t support menus. 
Nearly all themes have Menu options by default, but if yours doesn’t, 
visit the WordPress.org Codex site to walk through the process of 
adding this functionality.
http://codex.wordpress.org/Navigation_Menus
	
3.	To start building a menu, enter a name in the Menu Name field and 
then select Create Menu.
	
	Depending on your WordPress theme, you may have to select the plus 
(+) tab to create a new menu.
	
4.	In the Theme Locations box, select your new navigation menu from 
the drop-down menu. Then click Save.
	
	 Now your new menu will display on your blog instead of the default menu.
	
5.	In the Pages box, place a check mark beside the pages you want to 
add to your navigation menu. When done making selections, click 
Add to Menu.
	
	 This adds the selected page(s) to the Menu area on the right side. Each 
page you select becomes a separate tab in the menu.

navigation menu items can lead to confusion.

6.	In the Categories box, place a check mark beside the categories you 
want to include in your navigation menu. When you’re done making 
selections, click Add to Menu.
	
	 This adds the selected pages to the Menu area on the right side and cre­
ates a tab in your menu that navigates your reader to the archive page 
for that category. An archive page shows your blog posts in that cat­
egory, starting with the most recent.
	
	 You don’t need to select every category for your navigation menu (or 
any category at all, for that matter). You have many other options within 
your blog design to navigate readers to these archive pages. I go over 
these options in more detail later in this chapter and in Chapter 12.
	
7.	Click Save Menu to save your changes.
	
	 Visit your blog to see your new navigation menu. You may have to 
refresh the page if you already have it open in a browser window.
	
To change the order of your tabs, simply drag a page name above or below 
another page in the Menus screen. To create a drop-down menu for any naviga­
tion menu tab, drag the menu item slightly to the right underneath the menu 
item you want it to be a drop-down option for (see in Figure 11-6). The 
menu items that are indented make up the drop-down menu.

another menu item.

Adding images to your menu
When done effectively, adding images to your navigation menu can add flair 
to your blog design. Sometimes using a little image to the left of each menu 
tab simply becomes another place to tie in your overall blog branding — in 
other words, simply for good looks! However, images can also play a more 
functional role by adding more context to a menu item title. For example, an 
image of a plane beside a Where to Go tab helps readers better understand 
where that link takes them.
You can create your image in any photo-editing or illustration program. I 
created the star you see in Figure 11-7 by using Adobe Illustrator and then 
saving it as a PNG file with a transparent background. Saving the file this way 
ensures there’s no white box around the star. For more on choosing file for­
mats, refer to Chapter 15.
Figure 11-7: Dress up a navigation menu with images beside each tab.
Although there’s more than one way to add images to your menu, I want to 
show you how to do this in WordPress without getting too heavy into coding. 
Before you start the following steps, make sure your image is uploaded onto 
your server. You can add images as you build a new menu (like I describe in 
the following steps) or add images to a menu you already created (start with 
Step 6).
These steps walk you through adding an image to your About Me tab:
	
1.	Go into your WordPress dashboard.
	
2.	Choose Appearance➪Menus.
	
3.	To start building a menu, enter a name in the Menu Name field and 
then select Create Menu.
	
	Depending on your WordPress theme, you may have to select the plus 
(+) tab to create a new menu.
	
4.	In the Theme Locations box, select your new navigation menu from 
the drop-down menu and then click Save.
	
	Your new menu will display on your blog instead of the default menu.
	
5.	In the Pages box, place a check mark beside your About or About Me 
page.
	
	 This adds your page to the Menu area on the right side.
	
6.	In the Menu area box, click the drop-down arrow beside your About 
page button.

199
 Chapter 11: Laying Out Your Navigation Menu and Sidebars
	
	New fields appear underneath the About page button. The two you need 
to work with are the Navigation Label and Title Attribute.
	
7.	In the Navigation Label field, add the following code, replacing the 
background image URL with your image’s URL and replacing the Tab 
Name with the title you want to show up in your navigation menu (see 
Figure 11-8).
<div style=
   “background-image: url(‘http://www.yourblog.com/
imagelocation/image.png’);
   background-repeat: no-repeat; 
   display: inline; 
   margin: 0;
   padding: 0 0 0 25px;”>
Tab Name
</div>
	
8.	In the Title Attribute field, enter the title here as well.
	
	 This attribute is the alternative (alt) text that a visitor sees when they 
mouse over the menu item. For more on alt text used with images, see 
Chapter 9.
	
9.	When finished, click the Save Menu button.

Part III: Designing for Easy Navigation and Interactivity 
Showcasing Key Information with a Sidebar
When it comes to your overall blog design, sidebars are prime real estate. 
Sidebars showcase important things that you want readers to see, actions 
you want them to take, and places you want them to navigate. Your sidebar 
design helps the reader understand what awesomeness your blog has to 
offer. Sidebars can also drive subscriptions, sales, and social media followers. 
Sidebars pack quite a mighty punch!
The rest of this chapter lays out many ideas for items to include in your side­
bar (and some advice on how not to go overboard).
	
Many of the sidebar components that I talk about would also work well in your 
blog footer. See Chapter 8 for ideas on how to incorporate content into your 
footer.
Tying placement back to blog goals
When it comes to your sidebar area, you don’t want to add content or design 
elements haphazardly. Instead, remember those blog goals that I show you 
how to define in Chapter 3. Keeping those goals in mind help you decide how 
to prioritize what goes higher up above the fold (before a reader has to scroll 
down your page), what goes in the middle section, and what gets placed at 
the end of your sidebars.
For example, someone trying to build a larger presence on Pinterest might 
have a widget that pulls thumbnails of their latest pins, while another blogger 
might include an e-mail subscription box higher on the page.
In Figure 11-9, you see that Rachel from In Spaces Between (http://inspaces
between.com) features her newsletter subscription box at the top of her 
sidebar where readers can see it right away.
Keeping the same look and tone
Think about a brand you love. Now think about how deep that branding goes 
into every aspect of their presence. For example, every inch of an Apple store 
looks and feels like the brand. Even the product packaging has Apple’s signa­
ture touch of simplistic design. Another example is the website for the e-mail 
service provider MailChimp (http://mailchimp.com); from the homepage 
to a Save button, the site has a conversational, humorous tone.

Figure 11-9: A subscription box that stands out drives more subscribers.
Your sidebars should reflect your 
overall branding, too, by picking up 
design cues from the rest of your 
blog design. The tone of the sidebar 
text is also part of your branding. 
When you write the sidebar section 
titles or other content, pull in the 
tone and personality of your blog to 
give the sidebar a polished touch.
In Figure 11-10, the blog How to Be 
a Dad (www.howtobeadad.com) 
infuses a personality in a sidebar ele­
ment called “Connect-o-matic,” which 
highlights ways to connect through 
social media.
Identifying Elements 
to Build a Sidebar
Whether you’re filling up a sidebar from scratch or evaluating what you cur­
rently have, the possibilities are truly endless when it comes to adding things 
to your sidebar. In these next sections, I want to give you an idea of how 
much variety exists in terms of items to add to your sidebar. However, don’t 
feel like you have to add all these! Instead, be judicious and make sure that 
each element you add serves a purpose and makes sense for your blog.

Part III: Designing for Easy Navigation and Interactivity 
Introducing your social profiles
As you probably know by now, blogging encompasses more than just blog­
ging. As a blogger, you want to connect with your readers not only on your 
blog, but also in places they already hang out — Twitter, Facebook, and 
Pinterest just to name a few.
I can’t stress this enough: If there is one element you should have in your 
blog design, it’s a group of social media buttons that link to your profiles. 
Most readers won’t search you out on each separate platform, so having 
icons that link to your profiles makes it easy for them to connect with you.
The best place for your social media profile icons is toward the top of your 
sidebar or within your blog header. When you place these icons too far down 
into your sidebar, visitors must search your blog to find them. Because most 
people expect to see your social media profile icons toward the top of your 
sidebar, follow the status quo to ease navigation.
	
I have heard the argument to leave your social media icons off your blog 
in order to increase e-mail subscriptions. Well, doing that probably does 
increase your e-mail subscriptions — but only because you don’t give read­
ers any other option. Some visitors might subscribe with a tinge of frustra­
tion from having no other alternative, and others might not be bothered by 
the lack of icons at all. Ultimately, whether you include them is up to you.
Finding social media icons to use is as simple as searching for “social media 
icons” on any search engine. You’ll find a slew of options for icons that might 
fit your brand, or you can create your own icons to perfectly match your 
design. In Figure 11-11, you see that Patty from Deep Space Sparkle (www.
deepspacesparkle.com) created art-like social media icons that comple­
ment her overall blog design.
You can get most logos for the various social media platforms from their 
respective websites or by searching for “social media platform + logo”.
	
Include only those buttons for social media platforms that you actually use 
regularly. Re-evaluate your buttons from time to time to ensure you stay 
relevant.
Providing ways to subscribe
Many people visit all sorts of blogs and websites over the course of a day. 
At some point, they may start to become a blur, and your blog can easily get 
lost in the shuffle. So, offering your readers a way to subscribe to your blog 
can turn a casual blog visitor into a regular reader. 

203

Figure 11-11: These social media icons tie into the overall blog design.
Bloggers may offer two ways to subscribe to a blog: via e-mail or through an 
RSS feed. Subscribing through e-mail delivers the latest blog posts straight 
to someone’s inbox. Blog readers who subscribe via RSS feed typically read 
your blog through an RSS reader, such as Feedly (www.feedly.com).
Getting folks to subscribe to your blog means that they’ll receive your con­
tent regardless of whether they go to your blog. To get a blog reader to take 
action and actually subscribe, make your subscription area obvious and easy 
to use. You can do this by distinguishing your subscription area from the rest 
of your sidebar to attract attention. 
In Figure 11-12, you see that the subscription area on Everyday Bright 
(http://everydaybright.com) uses a dark gray and blue to stand out 
against the rest of the blog. In addition, this section establishes a hierarchy, 
highlighting e-mail subscription as the most important and the smaller icons 
below as other ways to follow the blog.
Sharing a brief biography
People enjoy connecting to other people, especially in the blogging world. 
Consider using some space in your sidebar design to welcome your first-time 
visitors with a short intro about you and your blog.

204
Part III: Designing for Easy Navigation and Interactivity

Figure 11-12: This blog makes it easy for readers to subscribe by making the subscription area 
stand out and just asking for an e-mail address.
Many successful blogs do fine without including this info, but including a 
little blurb like this greets someone at your virtual front door. From a blog 
design perspective, this overview actually connects the personality of your 
design to an actual person (with a personality). Also, including a picture of 
yourself can give your readers a visual connection to the face behind the blog. 
However, it’s really up to your comfort level with showing your face online.
You don’t need to spill all about your blog’s greatness here. Save that for 
your About page. In a sidebar blurb, try the following:
	
✓	A sentence about you
	
✓	A mention of your name (real, nickname, or pen name)
	
	Whether you use your real name or a pseudonym, people need a name 
to connect and know how to address you.
	
✓	A sentence about what your blog offers to your readers
	
Depending on the type of blog you write, you may just stick with telling 
visitors about what your blog offers them. No right or wrong here.
When creating this introduction, ask yourself, What’s In It For Me? (WIIFM). In the 
marketing world, the me in WIIFM is the consumer, and you ask this question to 
put yourself in the consumer’s shoes and ensure that content stays focused on 

205
 Chapter 11: Laying Out Your Navigation Menu and Sidebars
the consumer. As a blogger, put yourself in your readers’ shoes. Your sidebar 
is a key place in your blog design to entice readers to stick around, so tell them 
how they will benefit from reading your blog. Will they be inspired? Will they 
learn? What do you offer your readers? Why should they come back?
To show you what I mean about WIIFM, put on your blog-reader shoes:
	
✓	Say you read a blog about couponing and living on a budget. WIIFM? The 
blogger gives you hope that you can save that much, too — or motiva­
tion to start clipping coupons.
	
✓	Say you read a humor blog. WIIFM? This blogger’s stories entertain you. 
He makes you laugh even on your worst days.
	
✓	Say you read a blog about writing. WIIFM? This blogger provides value 
because you improve your own writing by applying what you learn.
See how these are really about the reader? So instead of writing something 
like, “I write daily about saving money,” opt for something like, “You’ll 
receive daily tips that save you money.”
Use this overview as a place to pull in your blog design as well as support it 
by really showcasing your voice. Notice how Yuliya from She Suggests (www.
shesuggests.com) accomplishes this (see Figure 11-13). The circle and font 
design elements tie into her header design. As for what she wrote, you learn 
more about her and her blog as well as get a sense of her personality.
	
You can also use this blurb as a teaser to get a visitor to navigate to your 
About page. Or simply just end it here as Yuliya did.
Highlighting credibility
If your blog (or you for that matter) has been mentioned or profiled on a 
popular website or in a really cool publication, then share this with your fol­
lowers. Highlight places that have shouted your praises by including their 
logos in your sidebar layout. They catch a reader’s attention because the 
publications or websites are often a well-recognized logo. Plus, they can help 
build your credibility as a blogger who really knows your stuff.
The same idea also goes for highlighting awards you’ve received as a blogger 
by including awards buttons. If you were nominated to a top blogger list for 
your niche or won a blog-related award, flaunt it. You deserve it!
	
Avoid those awards where you receive an award but have to post about it 
and nominate other bloggers. Those aren’t true awards but are more like 
chain-letters. Skip highlighting those altogether.

blogger’s personality.
Adding great social media widgets
Widgets are little applications that can be installed and executed within a 
website. WordPress comes with many built-in widgets to do things like dis­
play your recent posts, search form, or a drop-down of categories. (Blogger 
calls them gadgets.) However, widgets can also be used to highlight your 
activity on social media platforms. They add a design element to your side­
bar while showing readers a glimpse of your wider online presence. It’s a 
win-win!
In Figure 11-14, you can see a widget for the popular social media platform 
Instagram. Using SnapWidget (http://snapwidget.com), I created this 
widget to pull in my latest Instagram photos onto my blog.
The great thing about social media widgets is that they can be used for any 
blogging platform. All it takes is selecting a few settings and then copying and 
pasting code into your blog. I walk you through creating and installing some 
popular social media widgets in Chapter 13.

207
 Chapter 11: Laying Out Your Navigation Menu and Sidebars
Including relevant buttons 
or badges
A blog button — badge — is a graphic that you 
place in your sidebar and typically links to 
another site. A badge tells your readers a little 
more about you and what you’re up to. For 
example, a conference badge tells your readers 
that you’re attending an upcoming conference. 
Another blogger’s badge can highlight that you’re 
a fan of that blog. An awards badge can build 
credibility to showcase an award you won.
	
Choose only those buttons and badges that are 
relevant to your blog. Otherwise, you run the risk 
of cluttering up your sidebar design. For exam­
ple, if you never blog about reading, you don’t 
need a widget that displays your favorite books. 
Also, whichever badges you decide to display, 
keep them up to date, especially ones that say 
you’re going to a particular conference. It’s easy 
to forget about them.
Incorporating advertising
For bloggers looking to earn an income from their 
blog, advertising typically gets woven into the 
sidebar (and elsewhere on the site, too). Within 
your sidebar layout, determine the priority that 
your ads take over other sidebar design ele­
ments. Based on priority, decide where in your 
sidebar you want to display your ads.
Ads often earn you more money when placed toward the top of your sidebar, 
so many bloggers place one larger ad at the top and then place smaller ads 
further down in the sidebar. Other bloggers save the top of their sidebar for 
other elements, displaying ads only lower in the sidebar and elsewhere on 
their blog. However, you decide to incorporate advertising, make sure your 
overall sidebar layout doesn’t get overtaken by them.
In Chapter 7, I talk in detail about how to incorporate advertising into your 
overall blog design.
Deciding how to showcase categories and archives
Space in your sidebar is valuable because your sidebar guides readers to 
your content! Your sidebar design should showcase your blog content by 
offering important options within this compact space.
Figure 11-14: Instagram widget 
in a sidebar.

208
Part III: Designing for Easy Navigation and Interactivity 
On your blog, these options likely include categories and archives (as well as 
tags, popular posts, and most recent posts, all of which I cover in more detail 
in Chapter 12). In this section, you focus on ways to display categories and 
archives in your sidebar:
	
✓	Drop-down lists: These menus, when clicked, “drop down” (open) into 
a list for someone to make a selection. Using drop-down lists save valu­
able sidebar space.
	
✓	Lists: Lists show your categories or archives going vertically down a 
sidebar. If you don’t have a lot of categories, using a list might be a good 
choice. However, use caution when displaying archives this way. Most 
readers aren’t going to read through four years’ worth of blog posts that 
you listed all down your sidebar. Display archives in a drop-down or on 
a separate blog page.
	
✓	Tag clouds: Most blog platforms offer the ability to showcase your blog’s 
tags into a visual cloud that displays words you used to tag your posts. 
The more frequently used the word, the larger the word. If you are consis­
tent about the tags you use, using a tag cloud is an option. However, for 
the most part, tag clouds take up a lot of space without much value. It’s 
easier for the reader to make a selection through a list than a cloud of 
randomly placed words.
	
✓	Images: Images can really liven 
up your sidebar and draw atten­
tion to your categories. I talk 
more about using images in the 
upcoming section, “Including 
Visual Design within Your 
Sidebar.”
Saving space with a 
tabbed sidebar element
A tabbed sidebar widget is an element 
for your blog’s sidebar design that 
contains content separated by tabs.
The blog Musings of a Housewife 
(www.musingsofahousewife.com) 
uses a tabbed sidebar widget to 
combine three elements — a search 
box, categories, and archives (see 
Figure 11-15).

Figure 11-15: A tabbed widget design.

209
 Chapter 11: Laying Out Your Navigation Menu and Sidebars
	
A tabbed sidebar widget has two advantages:  It saves space in the overall 
sidebar design and groups ways to discover content all in one area for easy 
accessibility.
You can create this design element easily with a plug-in on WordPress. Here 
are a few options:
	
✓	Tabber Widget (free)

✓	Easy Tab Widget ($9)

✓	Hello Tabs WordPress Widget ($12)

Some themes include the functionality to create a tabbed widget as well. You 
can look through a list of places to find themes in Chapter 7.
Including Visual Design within Your Sidebar
Because sidebars hold a lot of content, you can easily bog it down with 
links and text. Spice it up! Create a sidebar that leaves a lasting impression 
by adding design elements from the rest of your blog design.
Adding interest with color
Pops of color can be an easy addition to your sidebar’s visual oomph. 
Not only does color liven up your sidebar, but it also pulls a readers’ eye 
to the content.
Change the entire background of your sidebar, use colored text for 
your section headings, or something else altogether. You have lots of 
possibilities!

210
Part III: Designing for Easy Navigation and Interactivity 
Creating section dividers
To provide structure to your sidebar’s overall design, organize your sidebar 
into sections that organize content into logical groups. Place advertisers in 
one area, popular posts in another, ways to find content in another, and so 
on. Using section dividers provides an opportunity to incorporate design into 
your sidebar and aids blog visitors in navigating around your sidebar layout.
Rage Against the Minivan (www.rageagainsttheminivan.com) uses section 
headers that look like strips of paper safety-pinned to a board (see Figure 11-16). 
These section headers stand out visually and give readers navigation cues so 
they know what each section is about.
© Kristen Howerton, Author – www.rageagainsttheminivan.com
Figure 11-16: Green section dividers in the sidebar bring in design from the blog header.
Here are a couple of ways to create section dividers:
	
✓	Style clickable text by editing your style.css file. Chapter 9 intro­
duces how this works. 
	
✓	Create an image for each divider and insert these images into the side­
bar by using a Text widget (WordPress) or HTML/JavaScript (Blogger). 
Just be sure to use alt attributes for your images like I talk about in 
Chapter 10.

211
 Chapter 11: Laying Out Your Navigation Menu and Sidebars
Showcasing key content through images 
One way to visually draw attention to a section of your sidebar is through 
using images. Use images for important sidebar items, such as popular posts, 
categories, or a link to a page like a Product page.
The blog Oh My Veggies (http://ohmyveggies.com) does a wonderful 
job of highlighting content with images (see Figure 11-17). Recipe categories 
in the sidebar are displayed with colorful buttons that link to each category. 
Because photos are such a big driver when it comes to recipes, the Recent 
Posts section of the sidebar shows wide, cropped images of the most recent 
recipes.
© Oh My Veggies – Design by Shay Bocks
Figure 11-17: Use illustrations and photos in sidebar design.
	
Using images can backfire if they look too much like ads. Make sure that your 
images are branded to fit your blog design. When images match your blog’s 
branding and design, readers can immediately identify images that lead to 
blog content, like the images shown in Figure 11-17.

212
Part III: Designing for Easy Navigation and Interactivity 
Staying Clear of Sidebar Distractions
Because your sidebar is a blank slate, you may find it easy to fill it up with 
content (especially with all the ideas I gave you). But wait! Adding certain 
sidebar content can really distract your readers from your main goals and 
your actual blog posts. You want to choose sidebar items that are useful for 
the reader and helpful to you, too. These next few sections go over some 
distractions and how to avoid them.
Eliminating visual clutter
Too much content can clutter your sidebar, and thus overwhelm the reader. 
Your key defenses against sidebar clutter are the tips and tools that keep 
sidebar content organized and easy to navigate. (For example, the drop-down 
menus, tabs, and widgets in the earlier section “Identifying Elements to Build 
a Sidebar.”) But those tools get you only so far if you have too much sidebar 
content to begin with. 
As you design your sidebar, keep an eye out for the following culprits, which 
often indicate that your sidebar has too much content:
	
✓	Long lists: Whether you list categories, archives, blogs you like, or some­
thing else altogether, long lists in your sidebar take up valuable space. 
Plus, a long list becomes a blur to your visitor. When you offer too many 
options, your reader can’t focus on any of them and options can all look 
the same. Keep your lists short or convert a list to a drop-down list, and 
visitors will be more likely to read them. Refer to the section “Deciding 
how to showcase categories and archives” for more on drop-down lists.
	
	Although there are no hard-and-fast rules, evaluate any list with more 
than ten items to make sure the list focuses the reader on the most 
important options.
	
✓	Blog badges: Blog awards, conferences, other blog badges, yada yada. 
Blog badges clutter your site quickly and give the impression that you 
have nothing else to put in your sidebar. Choose badges wisely. Read 
about how to judiciously choose them, earlier in this chapter.
	
✓	Excessive advertising: There’s nothing wrong with having ads on your 
blog. However, be wary of burying your content with too much of it. 
Chapter 7 describes the ins and outs of advertising in more detail.
	
✓	Lots of blinking, flashing images: Whether it’s an advertisement or just 
a button of some sort, beware of using too many moving images on your 
blog. They distract visitors from your content and, well, can be down­
right annoying.

213
 Chapter 11: Laying Out Your Navigation Menu and Sidebars
	
✓	Metadata: Some WordPress themes automat­
ically add a metadata section to your sidebar 
that includes administrative links like a link 
to your login URL (see Figure 11-18). Be sure 
to remove this and just bookmark your URL to 
log into your blog. Administrative links are 
for you, not your readers. Save your sidebar 
space for reader-centric content.
	
Thinking about your blog goals helps you priori­
tize your content and how to present it. A few 
clearly defined goals also help you decide what 
not to include.
Avoiding auto-playing media
Most people tell you the design is subjective, which is definitely true. 
However, I’m about to tell you to never do something.
Having sound or video that automatically plays when someone lands on your 
blog is a big no-no. No, it does not add to the ambience of your blog. People 
surfing the Internet expect to see a blog or website, not hear it.
If you put yourself in the reader’s shoes, you can see why this is a bad idea. 
What if someone was visiting your blog at work with the speakers up? What if 
your blog visitor was a mom who just got her baby to sleep? 
Few things make visitors click the Back button faster, so avoid using auto-
playing song playlists or video ads that start automatically.
Limiting your counting widgets
Counting widgets display various blog stats, such 
as RSS feed subscribers, your blog’s Google 
PageRank, or your number of Twitter followers 
(see examples in Figure 11-19). You can find most 
of these widgets by a simple Google search and 
then customize them to show your numbers.
These counting widgets can serve as social 
proof that you are a credible, influential blogger 
although numbers don’t always equal someone 
being truly influential. However, using too many 
of them can appear egotistical and look junky as 
well. Stick with the ones that are really important 
to you, if any, and ditch the rest.

Some widgets “watch” people, displaying specific information about a visi­
tor like where they’re from or what they’re reading. You often see it as a live 
traffic feed that reads something like Someone from Raleigh, NC read “Why 
Puppies Are Awesome.”
It feels a little creepy being watched, don’t you think? Obviously, I know how 
much information someone can learn from web analytics, but that’s private: 
Your reader doesn’t see that. Widgets like this are right in the reader’s face, 
and although they may not bother everyone, they may scare off others.
If you want to track what posts readers visit, use an analytics program like 
Google Analytics or StatCounter. Only you see this information, rather than 
anyone who visits your blog. See Chapter 5 for an introduction to analytics.

Making Content Easy to Find
In This Chapter
▶	Guiding visitors to your blog content
▶	Giving visitors a logical path to old content
▶	Exploring the difference between categories and tags
▶	Helping readers discover your blog posts
A

t the heart of blog design lies your content, but what good is an awe­
some blog design if it doesn’t drive visitors to your content? Sure, 
finding your latest blog post on your home page should be pretty easy, but 
consider navigating readers beyond that. Incorporating navigation design is 
integral to any good blog design.
This chapter gets you thinking about ways visitors might want to find your 
content. I offer ways for you to help your visitors find your old content as well 
as discover content they weren’t even looking for — but will certainly be glad 
to find. You also read about categories and tags and why they’re important in 
content discovery.
Giving Visitors the Opportunity to Explore
Someone landed on your blog for one reason or another: Someone either 
came to a particular post through a link from another site or found you 
through a search engine. Maybe the visitor heard about your blog from 
a friend or clicked a link shared on Facebook. Regardless, visitors come 
because something about your blog interests them.

216
Part III: Designing for Easy Navigation and Interactivity 
So after a visitor arrives at your site, you want to incorporate paths to other 
content within your blog design. People explore sites differently, so offer a 
few options to get visitors clicking around your blog to soak up your killer 
content. To make getting to know your blog easy and effortless, have ways 
for your visitors to do the following: 
	
✓	Explore categories.
	
✓	See what other readers like.
	
✓	See posts similar to the one they’re reading.
Making Sure Visitors Find What They’re After
Think about a good online shopping experience you’ve had. Although you 
probably went to that site originally because you liked those products, your 
overall shopping experience has kept you a fan. Maybe the company made it 
easy to find the right size or perhaps suggested other complementary prod­
ucts to help you complete an outfit.
Your blog’s navigation design works the same way. Anticipate your visitor’s 
needs by thinking about your blog like a store, and your blog posts are the 
products:
	
✓	Popular and recent posts: End caps on aisles and displays at the front 
of the store give you suggestions of things that are hot. On your blog, 
having a Popular Posts or Recent Posts list bring those blog posts to the 
forefront for readers to find your greatest and your latest.
	
✓	Related posts: When you’re in a store, you’ve seen strategic product 
placement: placing related products beside each other. Perhaps you 
went to pick up peanut butter but then saw jelly and decided you 
needed that, too. The same with placing batteries in the toy section. 
Related posts are like this. Your reader came to read a particular post, 
and you help them discover more by suggesting similar posts.
	
✓	Categories: If you’re in a new grocery store, you probably rely on the 
aisle signage that displays which main product categories are in each 
aisle. Your blog categories guide readers the same way.
	
✓	Search box: Having a search box as part of your blog design is like 
asking a store associate to help you find something in particular. You 
can find what you’re after right away.

217
 Chapter 12: Making Content Easy to Find
On the blog What I Wore 
(http://whatiwore.
tumblr.com), Jessica 
anticipates her readers 
desire to find certain out­
fits. On her sidebar, she 
includes a Find Your Way 
Around section of differ­
ent outfit types, a Recent 
Outfit Posts section with 
full-length photos, and even 
a cool grid of colors to find 
outfits by colors (like that 
shown in Figure 12-1).
Organizing with 
Categories and Tags
Bloggers often don’t think 
too much about how cat­
egories and tags apply to 
their navigation design. 
When writing a post that 
doesn’t exactly fit into a 
category, you might just 
start a new category. Or 
maybe you don’t quite 
understand tags, so you 
just use them endlessly for a blog post — or don’t use them at all. These next 
two sections help you properly organize your blog posts once and for all. Not 
only does using good organization make things easier on you, but your read­
ers will appreciate being able to find posts easily, to sort through them, or 
to discover new ones. In addition, using categories and tags effectively help 
with your search engine optimization (SEO).
Grouping with categories
A category is a broad classification of a topic that you write about. Although 
most platforms call these categories, in Blogger, these are called Labels. Blog 
platforms require that a post be included in at least one category, even if

what they’re looking for.

218
Part III: Designing for Easy Navigation and Interactivity 
it’s the Uncategorized category. On 
my blog, some of my categories are 
Blogging, Social Media, and Writing 
(see Figure 12-2). Using categories 
give your visitors a way to quickly 
find information that interests them.
	
To organize your blog posts effec­
tively, keep your number of categories 
to a minimum.
Earlier in this chapter, I compare your 
blog’s categories to aisle signs in a 
grocery store. Wouldn’t you be over­
whelmed if each aisle sign listed 20 
product categories? Your readers 
feel the same. They’d rather choose 
from 7 categories than a list of 50, so 
try to stick with using no more than 
10 categories. If you have years of 
creating lots of categories, you may 
have a little work to do paring down 
your categories! (Hang in there and 
take it a little at a time.)
	
Readers consider your blog more relevant in a topic if you have 30 posts in 
one category versus five posts in six different categories.
You can display categories in many different ways, from drop-down menus 
to images. A drop-down leaves you room in your sidebar for other important 
stuff and lets your readers read posts based on what topic interests them 
most. Read through Chapter 11 for some ideas.
If you’re having a hard time reducing your categories, you can also use sub­
categories to narrow down your topics without committing to full catego­
ries. For example, a category on social media might have subcategories for 
Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and so on.
	
If you decide to use subcategories, make sure that the URLs to your blog 
posts don’t include a category and subcategory. Otherwise, you end up with 
long URLs like
www.blogname.com/category/subcategory/blog-post-title
To fix this, change your permalink settings, as I mention in Chapter 10.
Figure 12-2: Categories organize your posts.

219
 Chapter 12: Making Content Easy to Find
Describing with tags
Tags get a little deeper than a category. A tag is a word or phrase that describes 
a blog post more specifically than a category. Tags are like micro categories. 
And selecting a category is required, but including tags is optional.
If the difference between categories and tags hasn’t quite clicked, check out 
Table 12-1. Notice how tags and categories work together to describe a blog 
post.
Table 12-1	
How Tags and Categories Work Together
Category
Tags
Recipes
chicken soup, low-fat, slow cooker
Photography
lens, Nikon, review, camera equipment
Hiking
mountain trails, Smoky Mountain National Park, day trip
Museums
kid museums, Raleigh, North Carolina, tourist attraction
Most blog 
platforms like 
WordPress (both 
.org and .com) 
show tags at the 
bottom of a blog 
post like you see 
in Figure 12-3. 
Displaying tags 
on a blog post 
helps visitors find 
similar content 
within an entire 
category. Clicking 
a tag takes you to 
a page of excerpts 
from blog posts 
tagged with that 
same word or 
phrase. When you 
assign tags to your blog post, follow these tips:
	
✓	Use tags that you think you’ll use again. This way, tags can better assist 
your readers by giving them more blog posts rather than just that one 
post you tagged “awesome places in NY.” 
Figure 12-3: On WordPress, categories and tags display before the 
comment fields.

220
Part III: Designing for Easy Navigation and Interactivity 
	
✓	Don’t get carried away. Using too many tags might overwhelm your 
readers with options. Instead, stick with just a few.
	
✓	Eliminate similar tags. If your category is Exercise, you don’t need both 
running and jogging. Stick with one convention so readers can look for 
just one tag to find more content on that topic.
	
If you’re on Wordpress.org and have a lot of categories you want to convert 
to tags (or vice versa), you can use the Categories and Tags Converter found 
from your Dashboard under Tools➪Import.
Helping Readers Find Old Content
As a blogger, you write and post, write and post, write and post. Your most 
recent content gets all the fanfare while older posts are forgotten. However, 
older content can still have some glory! After all, many posts you write are 
still as relevant as they were the day you published them. Providing easy 
ways to find your past content saves readers from fruitless scanning of blog 
post after blog post.
Adding a search box
Some readers may return to your blog in search of a blog post they’ve read. 
Other readers may want to find any blog posts you have about a particular 
topic. Whatever the reason, having a search box on your blog is a must-have.
Some themes already come with a search box added to your blog design 
layout. (Read all about themes in Chapter 7.) If not, you can usually add 
this popular feature to your blog via your blog’s administrator dash­
board. For example, WordPress.org offers a search box as a widget within 
your WordPress admin area. To add a search box to your sidebar using 
WordPress, follow these steps:
	
1.	Go to your WordPress.org dashboard.
	
2.	Choose Appearance➪Widgets.
	
	 The Search widget is available under Available Widgets.
	
3.	Add the Search widget to your sidebar by either clicking the Add 
button or by dragging the widget to your sidebar.
	
	 The option you use depends on the theme. The Twenty Eleven theme 
uses the Add button (see Figure 12-4). After the widget is in the desired 
location, you can adjust the title of the Search widget.
	
You can always add a touch of personality to your search box’s title or tie the 
title to the topics you write about. For example, a food blogger could title a 
search box Search for Deliciousness.

221
 Chapter 12: Making Content Easy to Find
Figure 12-4: Add a search box widget to your sidebar.
	
To customize the search box in the Twenty Eleven theme, find the following 
code in your style.css file:
input#s {
   background: url(images/search.png) no-repeat 5px 6px;
   -moz-border-radius: 2px;
   border-radius: 2px;
   font-size: 14px;
   height: 22px;
   line-height: 1.2em;
   padding: 4px 10px 4px 28px;
}
How to customize your search box really depends on your design prefer­
ences. You might want to change the search box height or change the font 
size. In addition to adjusting this code, you can also add to it. For example, 
adding background-color: gray before the closing bracket (}) makes 
the inside of the search box gray. See Chapter 9 for an introduction to basic 
HTML and CSS that every blogger should know and to learn how to access 
your style.css file.
	
If your blog is brand new, consider not adding a search box until you have a 
few blog posts under your belt. Otherwise, you might leave visitors under­
whelmed when search after search returns no content.
Creating an archive page
Archive pages aren’t the sexiest piece of your navigation design, but they can 
prove helpful for visitors to search through old content to navigate to vari­
ous places on your blog.
This type of archive page is different than the default archive pages you 
might see when you click the month from the WordPress Archive widget. 
With those, you go to a page containing that month’s posts. The archive page 

222
Part III: Designing for Easy Navigation and Interactivity 
I’m referring to here is more like a sitemap on a traditional website. Sitemaps 
typically show major categories of information and pages of a website all on 
one page. An archives page can do that, too.
Some WordPress themes come with an Archives template, but others don’t. 
Without getting into too much code, you can create an archives page by 
using a plug-in like one of these:
	
✓	Smart Archives Reloaded
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/smart-archives-
reloaded
	
✓	Snazzy Archives
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/snazzy-archives
I created my blog archives from the Genesis Framework’s archive page tem­
plate (see Figure 12-5). As you may have noticed, an archive page doesn’t 
have to be anything fancy. Most people who visit an archive page just want to 
scan through a big overview of your blog to find what they want. 
Figure 12-5: A basic archive page.
	
If you’re using WordPress and want to create an archive template without 
using a plug-in, you can visit the WordPress Codex page for how to do this:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Creating_an_Archive_Index

223
 Chapter 12: Making Content Easy to Find
Increasing Reach by Highlighting Your Blog Posts
One important way to help readers around your blog is to plant navigation 
seeds within your blog design. The power of suggestion is, well, powerful. 
Showing readers popular posts, relevant posts, and links to other posts aid 
the reader in finding out more about your blog’s content in a way that’s fluid 
and natural rather than disruptive.
Showing popular posts
The great thing about popular posts is that everyone has them (if you have a 
blog already, that is). When you have a list or page of popular posts as part 
of your blog design, this page becomes your personal promoter of sorts. If 
a new reader stumbles onto your blog, two things might happen that could 
make a popular posts section beneficial.
	
✓	Visitors may love the first blog post of yours they read and want more, 
more, more! Having a popular posts section puts all your golden posts at 
their fingertips and propels them further into your content.
	
✓	On the flip side, maybe someone read a post of yours that was either 
underwhelming or maybe just an announcement-type post, like telling 
readers you’ll be on vacation. Having a popular posts section gives this 
visitor direct access to what your blog can offer them.
Either way, including popular posts as part of your navigation design could 
be the difference between someone subscribing to your blog or just walking 
away (figuratively, of course). One way to add a popular posts list to your 
sidebar is on WordPress through a plug-in or on Blogger by using a widget. 
On WordPress, two popular (no pun intended) options are (the aptly named)
	
✓	Popular Posts plug-in
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/
wordpress-popular-posts
	
✓	nRelate Most Popular plug-in
http://nrelate.com/products/most-popular
These plug-ins give you a lot of customization options such as how many posts 
to display, how far back in time to go, and which categories to exclude — 
which will also force you to improve the categorization of your posts.
In Figure 12-6, you see that Sarah from Real Life (http://www.reallife
blog.net) draws attention to posts that are current favorites among her 
readers. She uses the setting built into the WordPress Jetpack plug-in:
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/jetpack

224
Part III: Designing for Easy Navigation and Interactivity 
Highlighting related 
posts
In effective navigation design, one 
goal is to keep readers engaged with 
your content. If visitors like the blog 
post they’re currently reading, they 
may want to read more about that 
particular topic. Using a plug-in or 
widget like LinkWithin (www.link
within.com) or nRelate Related 
Content (http://nrelate.com/
products/related-content) 
automatically pulls up posts similar 
to the one a visitor is currently read­
ing. Both LinkWithin and nRelate 
Related Content are available for 
WordPress and Blogger.
You can see one way to display 
related posts in Figure 12-7. Using 
LinkWithin, I display the three 
related post titles and thumbnails 
under my Adventuroo blog posts.
Linking to other pages
One simple navigation design trick 
is to make your blog’s content easy 
to find through interlinking, which 
simply means linking to older posts 
or pages from within another page 
or post. You can see what I mean in 
Figure 12-8.
Interlinking gives readers more rel­
evant content to read, all from within 
the blog post or page they’re cur­
rently reading.

Figure 12-6: Thumbnails add a visual touch to 
the popular posts listing.
Figure 12-7: Use LinkWithin to highlight posts 
similar to the post being displayed.
Figure 12-8: Linking to other posts is interlinking.

225
 Chapter 12: Making Content Easy to Find
Notice in Figure 12-8 that when I linked to another post, I didn’t say “that post 
I wrote about here” or “click here.” The reason is two-fold:
	
✓	First, which phrase sounds more specific: “click here” or “taking care 
of puppies”? Of course, “taking care of puppies” is more specific. This 
phrase — anchor text — makes it more clear to readers that the link 
navigates them to a place relevant to their interest. 
	
✓	Second, linking to other posts also helps with your search engine opti­
mization (SEO, which I talk about in Chapter 10) — that is, if you use 
proper anchor text.
Thinking in terms of SEO, “click here” isn’t a keyword someone might look up 
in a search engine. However, “taking care of puppies” is.
Building a sneeze page
Building a sneeze page is another great way to propel readers into your 
content through great navigation. The term sneeze page, coined by Darren 
Rowse from Problogger (www.problogger.net), refers to a page that 
directs readers to multiple posts within your blog.
These pages take many forms. You could have a page that highlights popular 
posts, posts around a specific topic, or posts that were part of a series. In 
Figure 12-9, you can see a sneeze page I created for a five-part series I wrote 
on blogger business cards.
Figure 12-9: Use a sneeze page to direct readers to posts on your blog.

226
Part III: Designing for Easy Navigation and Interactivity 
To build a sneeze page, create a new page in your blog platform and pull 
together the links you need to use on the page. Then use color, formatting, 
and images to help readers navigate deeper into your blog. See Chapter 14 
for ideas on how to lay out blog pages.

▶	Adding a sharing plug-in to your blog
▶	Overseeing blog comments
▶	Putting social media content in the spotlight
B

logging isn’t merely about writing content that people read. Blogging 
also means having conversations with readers. You and your readers 
may converse in the comments under a blog post, in a community forum, or 
on a social media platform outside of your actual blog. Blogging is also about 
sharing content. Sharing includes giving readers a way to share your content 
with their friends, family, fans, or followers via social media. A good blog 
design incorporates the ability for readers to interact with you (and even 
fellow readers) and spread the word of your awesomeness by sharing your 
content to a wider audience.
This chapter covers how to make content easier to share by using plug-ins 
that do the heavy lifting for you. I also tackle managing your blog comments 
so you encourage interaction rather than unintentionally discourage it. 
Finally, this chapter includes ideas for calling attention to your most active 
social media channels.
	
On WordPress.org, using too many plug-ins can slow down your blog’s loading 
time, so choose only those plug-ins you really need and deactivate or delete 
ones you aren’t using any longer.
By making content easy to share, more readers see your blog posts, and you 
increase your blog traffic. And when your content rocks, your readers will 
want to comment and share your posts with their networks.
The takeaway? Designing your blog to make sharing and interacting as easy as 
possible benefits your readers (they don’t leave in frustration). You benefit 

228
Part III: Designing for Easy Navigation and Interactivity 
by growing traffic and reaching into social media networks. And making your 
content easy to share involves making just small changes and adjustments to 
your blog. Minimal work with maximum benefit — a win-win!
Exploring Sharing Buttons for Your Blog Posts
If you want others to spread your awesomeness, you have to make sharing 
your blog posts part of your blog design. Without an easy way to share your 
blog posts on Facebook, Twitter, or another platform, many readers won’t 
bother to take the time to do it themselves.
For example, if a reader wanted to 
share a blog post on Twitter, but your 
post doesn’t have a sharing button, 
that person would have to copy the 
blog post’s URL, go into Twitter, paste 
the URL, copy or retype the post title, 
find your Twitter name to acknowl­
edge you in the tweet, and then tweet it. Whew! Adding sharing buttons like the 
ones you see in Figure 13-1 makes this much easier on your readers, because a 
sharing button does most of that work for them.
You have many options to include sharing buttons within your blog design. 
You can add the supporting code to your blog; however, most bloggers use 
some sort of sharing plug-in to display sharing buttons within their blog 
design. And many of these plug-ins aren’t WordPress-only, either! Here are a 
few popular choices:
	
✓	AddThis
www.addthis.com
	
✓	Digg Digg (WordPress.org only)
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/digg-digg
	
✓	Really Simple Facebook Twitter Share Buttons (WordPress.org only; 
displays more than just Facebook and Twitter)

✓	Shareaholic

229
 Chapter 13: Increasing Ability to Share and Interact
	
✓	Simple Social Buttons (WordPress.org only)
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/simple-
social-buttons
However, you can’t just install a social media plug-in and be done! The next 
two sections walk through customizing your plug-in to simplify sharing.
	
Blogger does have some built-in sharing capabilities, but consider using one 
of the plug-ins in the preceding list for more customization options.
Deciding what social media platforms to include
Plug-ins have to cater to many audiences, so they often come with options 
to include more than just the most well-known social media platforms. You 
can then pick and choose the platforms you want to display and the ones you 
don’t. For example, in addition to Facebook and Twitter, a plug-in might offer 
the ability to share to sites like Bebo, FriendFeed, Diigo, Orkut, Myspace, or 
Twackle. You need to pare down those offering for your readers.
Hand-selecting what social media platforms have sharing buttons on your 
blog has a few benefits: 
	
✓	Limiting readers’ choices actu­
ally increases the likelihood 
they will take action: I explain 
the thinking behind this behav­
ior in Chapter 10. In Figure 13-2, 
notice how cluttered the first 
set of icons looks with so many 
choices. Reader have to spend 
time searching for the icon they 
want to click. The second set gives a reader a choice without being over­
whelming.
	
✓	Choosing only a few platforms helps you cultivate your blog’s com­
munity: If you stick with the platforms that you use and most of your 
community uses, keeping up with your readers becomes much more 
manageable. You want to be able to follow what readers are saying when 
they share a post via social media and join in on the conversation. But 
if you include too many social sharing buttons below each post, readers 
(especially newer ones) won’t know where the conversation is really 
happening.
Figure 13-2: Providing readers with fewer 
choices is less likely to confuse them.

230
Part III: Designing for Easy Navigation and Interactivity 
When deciding which platforms to include, I can’t tell you to only include 
three options. Or four. Or five. Instead, make the decision by asking yourself 
these two questions:
	
✓	Is this social media platform where my audience is?
	
✓	Is this where I want to grow my audience?
If you live in a country where a certain social media platform is really popular 
or if your audience is big on a certain platform, add that platform into the 
mix! Also, check your analytics and see where your referring traffic comes 
from. Then ditch the rest.
	
Avoid multiple sharing plug-ins. It’s confusing. Your readers don’t need five 
different ways to Like a post on Facebook. A reader might get confused as to 
which one to use and just not use any of them.
Customizing your plug-in for effective sharing
Adding a plug-in to your blog can 
be a great asset to your blog design, 
but you may end up with some 
unexpected surprises if you don’t 
customize your plug-in options. For 
example, have you ever clicked a 
Tweet button on someone’s blog 
only to have it read via @share
this instead of that blogger’s 
Twitter handle (see Figure 13-3)?
I don’t know about you, but I like giving credit where credit is due. So do 
your readers. They want to mention you in the tweet, not @sharethis — or 
worse, no one at all. That is one of the surprises I’m talking about.
All the plug-ins I mention earlier in this chapter can be customized. In the fol­
lowing steps, I walk you through some key settings to adjust in the ShareThis 
plug-in so your readers can share your posts without frustration.
After you download and install the plug-in, start in your WordPress dash­
board, and then follow these instructions:
	
1.	Go to Settings➪ShareThis.
	
2.	Choose from one of seven display options.
Figure 13-3: Without changing your settings, 
the ShareThis Twitter name gets tweeted 
instead of yours.

231
 Chapter 13: Increasing Ability to Share and Interact
	
	 These styles range from showing the buttons as Large Icons to hori­
zontal counting buttons that display how many times a post has been 
tweeted, shared on Facebook, and so on. The default buttons are a 
Facebook Share, Tweet, Email, and ShareThis button. The ShareThis 
button displays more sharing options when clicked.
	
3.	Add a Facebook Like, Google +1, Pinterest, or Instagram button to the 
default buttons.
	
	 By default, all these are selected. To remove any, simply clear them.
	
4.	Choose which version of the 
sharing widget you want to see.
	
	 This choice is only for the green 
ShareThis button shown in 
Figure 13-1. I selected Multi-Post 
instead of Classic because Multi-
Post allows a user to share to 
many social media platforms 
from a pop-up on your blog 
rather than leave your blog (see 
Figure 13-4).
	
5.	Change the order of your 
buttons by clicking the Click to Change Order of Social Buttons or 
Modify List of Buttons link.
	
	This brings up a field with the names of all the buttons you’re currently 
using. Arrange the names into the order you want to display them. If you 
want to remove any of the original four default buttons, just delete the 
names of them here.
	
6.	Customize the Twitter sharing by clicking the Click to Add Extra 
Twitter Options link.
	
	 Within this section, you have two options to customize. As I mention 
earlier, you want to get visibility when people tweet your blog post. In 
the first field, enter your Twitter name so that it automatically adds via 
@NAME at the end of the tweet. Leaving it blank results in via @share
this being added (refer to Figure 13-3), so be sure to fill this in.
	
	 By entering your Twitter name 
in the second field in this sec­
tion, a page comes up after 
someone tweets with a sugges­
tion to follow you. If you don’t 
add your name to this field, 
your readers are prompted to 
follow the ShareThis Twitter 
account (see Figure 13-5).
Figure 13-4: The Multi-Post option in ShareThis.
Figure 13-5: Make sure your Twitter name 
shows up as a suggestion to follow, instead of 
ShareThis.

232
Part III: Designing for Easy Navigation and Interactivity 
	
	 Don’t add the @ in front of your Twitter name for either of these fields. 
The plug-in already adds this for you.
	
7.	Save your changes by clicking the Update ShareThis Options button.
Managing Comments
Whether readers leave you praise, a reaction, an opinion, a question, or even 
an answer, you probably love comments on your blog. Comments are part of 
what makes a blog social! But you also need to manage them.
When you think of managing comments, you probably think of deleting spam, 
but, managing comments also means organizing the commenting process as 
part of your overall blog design. Pay particular attention to the following:
	
✓	First, take a look at one of your posts. How easy is it to find the place to 
comment? If you display full blog posts on your home page, be sure you 
have a link to leave a comment at the bottom of the post. Readers are 
most likely to leave a comment after they actually read your blog post. 
You can also display the number of comments at the top of your posts 
with a link to comment; after all, lots of comments instantly suggests 
that your blog post is worth reading. Still, make sure that your comment 
link shows at the bottom, too. Showing that your readers are engaged 
through commenting provides social proof to new visitors, meaning that 
you get a boost in credibility right away.
	
✓	Next, consider adding the capability to notify a commenter when some­
one replies to his or her comment. This becomes helpful if you (or 
someone else) replies to someone’s question. Above all, these e-mail 
notifications increase the potential for even more interaction because 
that person may continue the conversation by commenting again.
For WordPress, you can use a plug-in like Comment Reply Notification:
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/comment-reply-
notification
For WordPress and other platforms, you can also use a third-party comment­
ing system, which I discuss later in this chapter.
	
For certain blog pages — for example, an About page, Contact page, and other 
types of pages — I strongly recommend turning off comments. On these 
types of pages, I’ve seen everything from a comment from a personal friend 
(not a Facebook Friend) — “Happy to see your blog is up!” —  to random 
questions that make your page look dated — “Are you going to the confer­
ence next week?” It’s also one more place to watch for spammy comments.

Capturing spam
At some point in your blogging adventures, you’re going to get a spammy 
comment. Comment spam is any irrelevant comment on your blog left with 
the intent of artificially increasing another website’s search engine rankings. 
When spammers leave a comment on your blog, they also leave a link to a 
website, hoping that the link helps build their search engine rankings.
As a blogger, dealing with comment spam on the backend of the blog can be 
difficult to manage without the right tools. On the front end of your blog — 
the part your readers see — a lot of spammy comments on your blog posts 
or pages can make even the most well-designed blog look unmonitored and 
less credible.
Many blog platforms have some built-in spam prevention, but you might need 
to take extra steps to combat spam. On WordPress, you can try these plug-ins:
	
✓	Akismet (Free for personal use)
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/akismet
	
	Just about every WordPress blogger has Akismet installed. If you don’t, 
then make this one of the first plug-ins you install. Akismet catches a 
great deal of spam and may be the only spam-fighting plug-in you need.
	
✓	WP-Ban (Free)
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-ban
	
	WP-Ban is a great plug-in when you’re having problems with certain IP 
addresses spamming your blog. In your WordPress comment tools, copy 
the IP address beside a problematic comment, and then input it into the 
WP Ban settings to prevent future spam, as shown in Figure 13-6.
	
✓	Growmap
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/
growmap-anti-spambot-plugin
	
	If you install Akismet and WP-Ban yet still have problems, try Growmap. 
Growmap asks readers to mark a check box to say they aren’t a spam­
mer. Because many spam comments are automated, they don’t take the 
added step of checking a box. I like that you can customize the message 
default message Confirm you are NOT a spammer, giving you 
another place to infuse a little personality into your blog design. For 
example, you could say Please let me know you aren’t an evil 
spammer by checking this box. 
	
Many plug-ins on WordPress — too many — can slow down how quickly your 
blog loads. Start with Akismet and then add other spam-fighting plug-ins only 
when necessary.

234
Part III: Designing for Easy Navigation and Interactivity 
Figure 13-6: Settings for the WP Ban plug-in.
	
If spam is a large problem for your blog, turning off commenting on older 
posts — even just specific older posts that seem to be targets — can help 
combat spam. On an older post, the real commenters are likely done with the 
conversation around that particular post. Turning off commenting won’t remove 
the conversation that’s already happened but will keep out the spambots.
Using word verification and moderation
To prevent spammers, some bloggers use a word CAPTCHA, moderate their 
comments, or both. CAPTCHA stands for Completely Automated Public 
Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart. Who knew? Unless you have 
a really compelling reason to do so, though, consider taking CAPTCHA and 
comment moderation off your comments. A well-designed blog should be 
as easy as to use as possible. CAPTCHA and moderation create a barrier to 
interaction between you and your readers.
A CAPTCHA displays a series of distorted characters or a simple math prob­
lem to solve. A reader has to enter that word or the problem solution into a 
field. This is supposed to prove the commenter is human because automated 
spam doesn’t have the cognitive ability to determine the correct answer (see 
Figure 13-7). 
	
Word verification isn’t inherently bad so don’t think you should never, ever 
use it. For example, if you have a registration form for an online course, you 
could add word verification there. Having said that, using word verification 
can annoy people, especially if a reader needs to leave multiple comments 
(like leaving comments with entries to enter a giveaway). A potential com­
menter might leave your blog out of frustration.

235
 Chapter 13: Increasing Ability to Share and Interact
Figure 13-7: Two common types of CAPTCHAs: a math problem and word verification.
Comment moderation means that you don’t let comments publish to your 
blog instantly. Instead, the comments go into a queue for you to approve.
If you want to design your blog for interaction, skip comment moderation. 
After all, interaction can’t happen until you approve each comment, which 
means your blog might be silent for hours. People like the instant gratifica­
tion of being able to see a comment post immediately, which implies that you 
trust them. Plus, seeing comments by others encourages new visitors to that 
blog post to comment.
After comments are published to your blog, then of course delete any spam 
that makes it through or delete posts that you deem inappropriate. If a lot of 
spam goes through, consider using the plug-ins I suggest in the previous section.
	
If you moderate comments because you’re worried about not getting notified 
of new comments without moderation, there’s a way to do this! For Blogger 
users, go to Settings and click the Comments tab from your Dashboard. At 
the bottom of that page, in the Comment Notification Email field, enter your 
e-mail address and voila! For WordPress users, go to Settings➪Discussion 
and then select the check box to be notified. You should now get e-mail noti­
fication when someone comments, without having to moderate them.
	
Visitors might want to comment on many blog posts and often leave com­
ments on blog after blog. They expect to be able to comment quickly and 
easily, so help them.

236
Part III: Designing for Easy Navigation and Interactivity 
Choosing a third-party commenting system
Many bloggers stick with their blog platform’s native commenting system. 
After all, every blog platform has the ability to leave comments. However, 
bloggers sometimes look for more functionality in their commenting system — 
and that’s when a third-party commenting system comes into play.
A third-party commenting system can increase sharing and interaction 
because most offer the ability to post the comment not only on your blog, 
but on a social media channel as well. For example, when visitors leave a 
comment on your blog, they have the option to post it to their Facebook 
profile. This can bring new readers to your blog by extending your commu­
nity to new eyes.
The downside to using commenting systems like these is that some readers 
complain about having to log in. Fellow bloggers might not mind because 
they’re probably already logged in via one of these systems. However, 
if you have a lot of readers who aren’t bloggers, they might not want to 
log in, even if they can log in by actually signing into Facebook or Google 
account through the commenting system. And even though the Disqus 
and IntenseDebate commenting systems allow you to log in as a guest, the 
options presented might confuse visitors into thinking that they have to log in.
See Table 13-1 for the most common third-party commenting systems, 
supported blogging platforms, and ways to log into the system.
Blogger commenting options
If you’re on Blogger you should know that by 
default new blogs are set to allow comments 
only from registered users. Registered users 
are those with WordPress.com, LiveJournal, 
TypePad, AIM, OpenID, or Google Blogger 
accounts. If you want to receive comments 
from WordPress.org users — and anyone else 
for that matter — you must change your set­
tings so that anyone can comment. To change 
this, start at your Blogger Dashboard. Go to 
Settings➪Post and Comments and select 
Anyone from the Who Can Comment setting.
This allows readers to comment by entering a 
Name and URL. This does mean that you have 
to allow anonymous comments, too, but you 
probably won’t get that many. Plus, you want 
to make commenting easy on your readers. I 
can’t tell you how many bloggers I know who 
have left a Blogger blog without commenting 
because this option wasn’t available!

Highlighting Social Media Profiles
Building a great blog design means inviting readers to easily become 
immersed in your blog community. Think of your blog as the hub of your 
community and the social media channels as spokes.
In Chapter 11, I describe how including buttons that link to social media 
profiles allows your readers to follow or connect with you with little effort on 

238
Part III: Designing for Easy Navigation and Interactivity 
their part. This section covers how to add sidebar buttons that link to your 
social media profiles. In addition, this section covers social media widgets 
that infuse parts of those communities into your blog design. By doing so, 
you highlight your involvement in a greater community that extends outside 
your blog, which leads to more interaction within those social media platforms.
Adding social media buttons to your blog
Including social media buttons in your sidebar gives readers links to your key 
profiles in one place. After you find or create social media buttons that com­
plement your overall blog design, placing them on your blog involves simply 
adding a little HTML code to your sidebar. You may even want to display the 
social media buttons again in your footer because a visitor might scroll down 
your blog to where your sidebar’s buttons are no longer visible.
	
A quick Internet search for social media buttons or social media icons gives 
you many pre-made options to choose from. You can also design your own 
buttons using social media logos and a design program like Adobe Illustrator, 
Adobe Photoshop, or PicMonkey (www.picmonkey.com). Do a search for 
social media vectors or silhouettes to find the logos needed to create your 
buttons.
To add a social media button to your sidebar, you first want to upload 
the button images onto your blog. Then, after your social media icons are 
uploaded to your blog, you can add them to your sidebar. In the following 
steps, I use a Twitter button as an example. Copy the URL of the image you 
uploaded, and then take the following steps in WordPress:
	
1.	Open your WordPress dashboard.
	
2.	Navigate to Appearance➪Widgets.
	
3.	Under Available Widgets, find the one named Text.
	
4.	Click the Text button and then drag it to the right column into the 
Main Sidebar area.
	
	 The exact title of this area may vary, depending on your blog’s theme.
	
5.	Add the following code into the Text box (see Figure 13-9).
<a href=”http://twitter.com/NAME” target=”_blank”>
   <img src=”http://www.NAME.com/Images/twitter-icon.
png”>
</a>

239
 Chapter 13: Increasing Ability to Share and Interact
	
	 In Step 5, the bold and italicized 
text indicates a placeholder. Be 
sure to replace the placeholders 
with, respectively, the actual 
name that appears in your 
Twitter URL and the actual loca­
tion of the image that you want 
to link to your Twitter page. If 
you need help remembering 
what this code means, see 
Chapter 9. You can also add a 
title to this sidebar section if 
you’d like.
	
6.	Click Save.
	
	 Be sure to visit your blog after 
you save it to make sure the 
icons look okay and the links 
work correctly.
Enhancing your blog with social media widgets
Social media widgets bring your extended online community straight to your 
blog by giving readers a glimpse of your involvement in that particular social 
media platform. Some bloggers like to add a widget or two into their blog 
design, either in a sidebar or a footer.
By showcasing pictures, posts, or tweets right on your blog, you encourage 
readers to become involved by piquing their interest in those communities. 
Just know that every widget invites readers to click away from your blog. For 
that reason, just stick to using one or two within your blog design; you don’t 
need a widget for every single social media platform you’re on.
Here are some popular social media widgets you can add to your blog design:
	
✓	Facebook Like box
http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/
like-box
	
	Add a Like box to your blog. The box displays a reader’s friends who 
follow you, your latest Facebook fan page posts, or both.

Twenty Eleven theme.

✓	Twitter
https://twitter.com/login?redirect_after_login
=%2Fsettings%2Fwidgets
	
	You can show tweets from your full timeline or limit the tweets shown to 
those that you mark as a Favorite or include in a list or those that con­
tain a keyword or hashtag.
	
✓	Pinterest Button and Widget Builder
http://business.pinterest.com/widget-builder
	
	Display your latest pins or highlight pins from a particular board.
	
✓	Instagram SnapWidget
http://snapwidget.com
	
✓	Instagram Widget
www.instagme.com
	
	Show off all your Instagram pics, or pics from a certain hashtag.
	
If you’re on WordPress.org, you can also find plug-ins for all these, but 
remember that using too many plug-ins can slow down your blog’s loading 
time. Using widgets that create HTML code for you to place into your blog’s 
sidebar or footer avoids the use of plug-ins.
Because Facebook is the most popular social media platform, I want to walk 
you through customizing a Facebook Like Box widget and putting it on your 
blog.
To create a Facebook Like Box, follow these steps:
	
1.	Visit the Like Box Developers page:
http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/
plugins/like-box
	
	 In the center of the page, you see a sample Find Us on Facebook box.
	
2.	Type your Facebook page’s URL into the first field.
	
	 When you press Tab to go to the next field, the sample box changes to 
your own page’s feed.
	
3.	Customize the box, using the fields shown in Figure 13-10.

241
 Chapter 13: Increasing Ability to Share and Interact
Figure 13-10: Facebook Like Box settings.
	
	 You have a few fields to select your preferences:
	
•	Width and Height: The width is typically set to the width of your 
sidebar. Select a height as well if you want to constrain the box to 
a certain height; otherwise, the height is determined automatically.
	
•	Show Faces: Leaving this setting checked shows the faces of a visi­
tor’s friends who also like your Facebook page. This can help build 
your credibility because if their friends like your page, then they 
may be missing out!
	
•	Color Scheme: Select either light or dark.
	
•	Show Stream: This shows your latest Facebook posts, and a visitor 
can scroll through them right from your blog page (although they 
can’t comment, Like, or share them). Displaying this can pique 
curiosity and drive more Likes.
	
•	Border Color: Enter this value as a hex color code (#xxxxxx) or by 
writing in a common color name (red, blue, and so on). For more 
on hex codes, see Chapter 6.
	
•	Show Header: Deselecting this makes the Find Us on Facebook 
header disappear.

242
Part III: Designing for Easy Navigation and Interactivity 
	
4.	Click Get Code.
	
	 This brings you a box with various types of code to copy and paste into 
your own blog.
	
5.	Click the IFrame tab; then copy and paste the code.
	
6.	Add a widget for Text (WordPress) or gadget for HTML/JavaScript 
(Blogger) to your sidebar.
	
7.	Paste the content into the HTML field.
	
8.	Save your changes.
	
	 If you visit your home page, you see your customized Facebook Like box 
in your sidebar.
	
To prevent your sidebar from becoming overwhelmed with too many social 
media widgets, select the ones that are the most important to you. You can 
also use them in your blog footer as well, which I talk about in Chapter 8.

hen designing or redesigning a blog, you often find that you focus so 
much on your overall design — the header, sidebars, and layout — 
that your main pages of content becomes an afterthought. However, incorpo­
rating blog design into main pages of content gives you more opportunities 
to showcase your awesome blog design and make your content shine.
This chapter walks you through six common blog page types, giving you 
ways to design these pages from both a visual and navigation standpoint.
	
For tips on formatting your actual blog content for easy readability, check 
out Chapter 16.
Incorporating Design into Your Blog Posts
Working in a few simple design elements can attract a reader’s eyes to your 
blog posts. The next few sections walk through strategies for jazzing up the 
elements in a blog post.
Customizing blog post titles
Blog post titles are quite likely the most repeated design element on your 
entire blog. This makes blog post titles an easy place to pull in something 
from your overall blog design into your main content area.

246
Part IV: Creating Design-Friendly Content 
Here are some ideas for customizing your blog post titles:
	
✓	Custom font (See Chapter 6)
	
✓	Special color (See Chapter 6)
	
✓	Another color that displays when someone hovers over your title (See 
Chapter 9)
	
✓	Small design element or graphic before each title (See Chapter 11)
In Figure 14-1, you can see that my 
blog post titles use my custom font 
as well as two viewer-activated 
colors. The blue shows when some­
one hovers over the title.
Identifying what to 
include in your byline
Even if you’re never heard the term 
byline, you’ve surely noticed one. A 
byline is technically the display of a 
blog post’s author, but it often refers 
to a wider net of information at the top of the post, such as the author name, 
date, time, categories, and so on. In WordPress, you might hear it referred to 
as post metadata. 
This area of your blog posts doesn’t have to be fancy from a design perspec­
tive. However, using a different byline font style than your blog post title and 
content helps give the byline a subtle, yet informative place within your blog 
page design. Many bloggers use small caps or italics for a byline.
Good blog design also means providing some information that provides context 
around your blog post. Of course, deciding what information to display depends 
a lot on your blog theme, but here are some common things to include:
	
✓	Author name: If you’re the only writer for your blog, make sure your 
byline doesn’t say the highly impersonal, default name “admin.” Some 
themes add byline options in the theme settings. In WordPress, go to 
Users➪Your Profile and then check whether the Display Name Publicly 
As field shows the name you want to display.
	
	If you want a guest blogger’s name to show in the byline without making 
them a user of your blog, consider using a WordPress plug-in like 
Custom Author Byline:
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/custom-author-
byline
Figure 14-1: Use blog post titles with custom 
font and color to match overall design.

247
 Chapter 14: Designing Main Pages of Content
	
✓	Categories: Displaying the category you assigned to a blog post can 
make it easy for your reader to navigate to an archive of posts in that 
particular category. It also gives the reader a clue as to what your blog 
post is about. (Read more about categories in Chapter 12.)
	
✓	Link to comments: Depending on your theme, a link to blog post com­
ments shows up either at the top or bottom of your post. A visitor 
simply clicks the link and is directed to an area to leave a comment. See 
Chapter 13 for more about managing comments. 
	
✓	Tags: Many bloggers prefer to list tags at the bottom of a post or not 
to list them at all. Because you might use a lot of tags for one post, this 
keeps the top of your blog post from being too cluttered. (Read more 
about tags in Chapter 12.)
Styling block quotations for visual interest
Within your blog posts, you’ve prob­
ably emphasized a bit of text before 
by using the block quote (or block 
quotation) feature in your visual 
editor. (Figure 14-2 shows the block 
quote icon in WordPress.) Depending 
on your blog theme’s settings, the 
emphasized text might display with 
a box around it, such as the simple 
block quote design from my blog, 
Momcomm, shown in Figure 14-3. 
Another theme might use large 
quotation marks to set off the block 
quote, or some other visual element.
Block quotations are used to high­
light a quote from a person or another 
source. In other words, use block 
quotations solely for quotes — a 
famous quote, a quote from an article, 
a definition cited from a dictionary, and so on. Block quotations are also 
characterized by the fact that the quoted text isn’t mentioned elsewhere 
within the article (which differs from a pull quote, where text is pulled from 
the article and emphasized in a styled quote). 
As I mentioned in Chapter 2, readers tend to scan content on the web. Block 
quotations provide a way to draw attention to quotes more than just using 
simple quotation marks.
	
Block quotations shouldn’t be used to simply make part of your own writing 
stand out within a blog post. If you want to highlight other parts of your 
content, then use indentation or other methods I describe in Chapter 16.
Figure 14-2: Create a block quote in WordPress.
Figure 14-3: Even simple block quote styling 
stands out within a blog post.

248
Part IV: Creating Design-Friendly Content 
You can customize your block quotes to complement your overall blog design. 
To do so, you need to dig into your blog’s style.css file. If you’re not com­
fortable editing code, this may seem daunting, but just look for the word 
blockquote in the style.css file. (That’s the CSS selector that styles text 
in a <blockquote> tag in your HTML, as I explain in Chapter 9.) After you 
find the blockquote selector, you can see where to play with the CSS code.
Bloggers often style eye-catching block quotes in one or more of the following 
ways:
	
✓	Changing the color or size of the text
	
✓	Adding a box or border around the text
	
✓	Applying a background image within the CSS that displays the quote 
within a talk bubble, with a large quotation mark to the left of the quote, 
or another visual element 
	
✓	Indenting the text
	
✓	Adding a vertical line to the left of the text
Sharing Your Story with an About Page
Aside from your home page, your About page is the single most important 
page on your blog, because an About page is the first place someone goes to 
find out more about you and your blog. 
The About page is also one of the hardest pages to write because it’s hard 
to talk about ourselves! Moreover, the About page can leave you stumped as 
to how to incorporate design into the page. You probably don’t think much 
about adding design elements other than a picture of yourself.
This section gives you ways to make your About page more meaningful to 
your reader through both visual appeal and navigation.
Breaking up areas through visual design
With an About page, you can get so wrapped up in what you want to say that 
your page ends up mostly being a large wall of text. However, just like a blog 
post, an About page needs some visual elements that align with your overall 
blog design and catch the readers’ attention.

249
 Chapter 14: Designing Main Pages of Content
Here are some ideas to break up your page with design elements:
	
✓	Single photographs: People like to see a picture of the person behind 
the blog. If you blog anonymously, this still applies to you! Take a fun 
picture with your back to the camera or use a good illustration so you 
don’t have to reveal yourself. Also, consider including pictures relevant 
to your blog or that give someone a better picture of who you are. These 
images could be a famous monument if you’re a travel blogger or a pic­
ture of your family for a personal blog.
	
✓	Photo collages or strips: Another way to include photos is by using col­
lages or even a ribbon of thumbnail photos (similar to a strip of film). 
These images liven up the page and provide visual information about 
the topics on your blog.
	
✓	Subheadings: Images are the only visual element on an About page. 
Subheadings also break up long blocks of text. (Read more about this 
technique in Chapter 16.) They give the reader a place to pause and can 
entice readers to read further.
	
✓	Bullets and numbered lists: Organizing your content into bullets or 
numbered lists gives readers a visual break and emphasizes key things 
you want the reader to know.
	
✓	Testimonials: If your blog is more product-oriented, try including a tes­
timonial to break up the text. Use the block quote treatment so the testi­
monial visually stands out, which I cover earlier in this chapter.
	
✓	Call-to-action area: Use your About page as a chance to capture a small 
piece of information, like an e-mail address for a newsletter. If you add 
this near the bottom of your page, you can even repeat the same sub­
scription box from your sidebar, especially because the reader may 
have scrolled past the sidebar subscription box and it’s now out of 
sight.
	
✓	Social media icons: At the end of an About page, offer a way to connect 
with you by including social media icons for your profiles.
One of the best About pages on the web is from Kiersten at Oh My Veggies 
(http://ohmyveggies.com). She mixes the right blend of personal details 
and information about her blog in a way that’s both fun and visually awesome. 
Figure 14-4 shows a few of the elements she includes on her About page.

Figure 14-4: Design elements on an About page can really liven up the page.
Including navigational cues
If you use visual elements to pull your blog design into your About page, 
don’t let navigational design go to the wayside. An About page’s purpose is 
to tell the reader more about you and your blog, but you can include only so 
much information without the page becoming overwhelming. 
	
An About page should always give the reader something to do next or some­
where to go next. You can do this through the following three navigational cues:
	
✓	Interlinking: Interlinking puts other content on your blog within easy 
reach by linking to it within the text of your About page. A visitor who’s 
reading your About page is clearly interested in you and your blog. 
Entice this reader into becoming a regular blog visitor by pointing him 
or her to some hand-selected examples of your content.
	
	In Chapter 12, I go into some more detail about interlinking. Instead of 
linking within your text, you can direct readers to posts visually, by linking 
image thumbnails and post titles.
	
✓	Links to other sites: Instead of just showing a list of sites you contrib­
ute to, projects you’ve been a part of, or places you’ve been featured, 
include a link to them as well. Doing this saves the reader from having to 
find those links on their own (most won’t bother), with the added ben­
efit of boosting your credibility. Just keep in mind you don’t want too 
many links that navigate away from your blog so do this in moderation.
	
✓	Contact information: Yes, you should have a separate Contact page, 
but put it in easy reach by linking to that page within your About page.

 Chapter 14: Designing Main Pages of Content
Even better? Include an e-mail 
address right on your About 
page so that readers don’t even 
have to click over unless they 
want more details or a contact 
form to fill out. If you’re inter­
ested in working with brands 
(for product reviews, advertis­
ing, or partnerships), many 
brand reps visit blog after blog. 
They’ll be grateful to save a 
little time by having the contact 
information handy.
In Figure 14-5, notice that Jo-Lynne 
from Musings of a Housewife (www.
musingsofahousewife.com) does 
a good job of linking to places both 
on and off of her blog. She also pro­
vides images along with the links to 
lead readers deeper into her blog.
Laying Out the Basics with a Start Here Page
When it comes to new visitors navigating your blog, you want them to magi­
cally understand exactly what your blog is all about, subscribe or follow the 
blog on social media, and start reading your content — in just one visit. With 
a Start Here as part of your blog design, you have a better chance of making 
that magic happen.
Blog visitors often need a little extra guidance in navigating your site for the 
first time, even if you think your site describes itself through your design and 
content. Time is scarce, so the easier you make it for visitors to get a crystal 
clear picture of your blog, the more grateful they’ll be.
A Start Here page tells your readers how they can benefit from your blog and 
highlights some of your best content to prove it.
From a content standpoint, your Start Here page shouldn’t rehash your 
About page. Instead, focus mainly on your readers and describe who your 
blog is for and why they should read it. From a design standpoint, follow 
some of the visual element suggestions I mention in the About section: things 
like adding images, subheadings, and bullets.

Part IV: Creating Design-Friendly Content 
Showing off your best stuff
This Start Here page can really make or break your new reader’s opinion of 
your blog. This means you have to share your absolute best content that 
really gives a clear snapshot of what your blog is about. (No pressure, right?)
Although your About page may have covered some of your best content, the 
Start Here page uses your great content to convince the reader your blog is 
the place for them. Make that content visually interesting with thumbnails, 
images, graphical elements, or even a touch of color.
	
Including a link on your About page to your Start Here page gets readers navi­
gating to a place to learn even more specific information about your blog.
A Start Here page doesn’t have to literally say Start Here, nor do you have 
to begin the page describing exactly what your blog is about. The blog How 
to Be a Dad (www.howtobeadad.com) calls this page the New Here? page. 
Bloggers Charlie and Andy start off by dispelling the idea that their blog is 
serious advice about how to be a dad. They make it clear from the start what 
their blog is not, and then feed visitors their best content.
As you see in Figure 14-6, they visually show off their popular Notebook and 
Instructional Diagrams with a short section introduction, thumbnail images, 
and blog post titles to guide the reader to some of their best stuff.

 Chapter 14: Designing Main Pages of Content
Asking your reader to take action
New readers navigate to your Start Here page because they want a course of 
action. Showing your best content should convince the reader whether your 
blog is the place for them. If they like what they see, the next logical step for 
the visitor is to take action by subscribing to your newsletter, signing up for a 
course, or following you in social media.
Whichever action you want your visi­
tor to take, make that section visually 
distinct from the rest of the page. The 
section should draw readers’ eyes 
straight to it so they can’t miss it.
Distinguish your call-to-action section 
by using a different color or different 
design element not used elsewhere on 
the page. Within that design element, 
stick to a simple action statement, 
which is easier to digest than a wordy 
one. In Figure 14-7, you see the last 
section of the Smart Passive Income 
blog (www.smartpassiveincome.
com) Getting Started page. Pat uses 
the same section design as the rest of 
this page but grabs attention with a 
product image (that’s free!) and a to-
the-point subscription box.
Encouraging a Sale with a Product Page
Bloggers don’t often start out offering products on their blog but sometimes 
stumble into selling products as their content and audience grows. An effec­
tive design and layout on a product page can be the difference between a sale 
and, well, no sale!
The products you sell as a blogger might be virtual or physical ones. Now or 
in the future, you might sell items like the following:
	
✓	E-books
	
✓	Online courses
	
✓	Printables (craft templates, tutorials, checklists)
	
✓	Branded items (t-shirts, stickers, mugs)
	
✓	Related products
	
✓	Handmade products

clear, visual call to action.

254
Part IV: Creating Design-Friendly Content 
Whether you’re designing a product page as a single page or as part of an 
ecommerce store, this section gives you tips for a well-designed page that 
commands attention and encourages a sale.
	
See Chapter 17 for some ideas on extending your brand to virtual products, 
such as printables and e-books.
Piquing interest through quality imagery
When it comes to selling products on your blog, imagery within your product 
page design can make or break a sale. High-quality imagery conveys profes­
sionalism and credibility. Whether you’re selling an e-book or a knitted hat, 
create a page design that includes appealing imagery.
If you sell physical products, make sure the products are taken in good light 
and without distracting backgrounds. Consider using close-up images in addi­
tion to the main product images to show product details. See Chapter 15 for 
tips on what makes a good-quality image.
If you sell virtual products on your blog, you don’t have product photographs 
to work with. However, you do have lots of possibilities when it comes to 
visually showcasing your virtual product, such as the following:
	
✓	E-covers: An e-cover is an image or set of images designed to look like 
a physical book, disc, or other representation of a physical product. 
For example, if you sell an e-book, you might have an e-cover created 
that looks like an actual book. You can find e-cover creator software 
online or create them yourself if you’re graphically savvy. Just be careful 
that your image doesn’t mislead the visitor (like showing a really thick 
e-book graphic for a 20-page e-book). One online e-cover creator you can 
try is MyEcoverMaker (www.myecovermaker.com/ecover-design), 
who lets you pay per e-cover download or by month.
	
✓	Sample image: Show a sample page or image from your virtual product 
to give visitors a glimpse of what they’ll receive. In Figure 14-8, you see 
that Christina from the blog Hair Romance (www.hairromance.com) 
showcases her 30 Braids in 30 Days e-book cover and an image that 
highlights a page from the e-book.
	
✓	Supporting graphics: Aside from showing the actual product, consider 
using colored graphical elements to pull the visitor down through the 
product page. This could be a light border between sections on a long 
page, the logo of your product, or another graphical image. Just be care­
ful not to overdo it.

content the e-book includes.
Interesting your prospects with 
appealing testimonials
Testimonials aren’t just a way to build trust. They can also provide a visual 
break within your product page design. Testimonials help a potential buyer 
overcome skepticism and doubt, so you want them to get noticed. Just dis­
playing them as plain text in the body of your content won’t cut it.
Make testimonials stand out visually by adding color (text, background, 
border), using the block quote function (see the earlier section, “Styling 
block quotations for visual interest”), or displaying a headshot of the person 
giving the testimonial.
In Figure 14-9, notice how the testimonials on the blog No Meat Athlete (www.
nomeatathlete.com) stand out from the rest of the page’s content. Each 
one uses a subtle background color and bolded text at the top to highlight a 
quote pulled from the full testimonial. Some also include headshots to per­
sonalize the testimonial.

Styling the testimonial can be done within the content itself or use a plug-in 
that formats testimonials for you, like the Testimonials Widget for WordPress:
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/testimonials-widget/
screenshots
You can also create a quote in a photo-editing program and use it on your page 
as an image. Just make sure to use an effective image title (see Chapter 15) 
and an alt attribute (see Chapter 10).
Closing the deal with a distinct call to action
You’ve probably heard the phrase “Ask for the sale” before. On your blog’s 
product page, this doesn’t necessarily mean asking a question. It means 
asking the visitor to do something. In the marketing world, this request is 
known as a call to action. Your call to action can be something like Add to 
Cart, Get Started, or Download Now. Feel free to get even more creative with 
it! A call to action on your product page is most effective when it’s done 
within a graphical element of some sort.
In Chapter 2, I talk about contrast being a core principle of good design. A 
call to action that contrasts with the rest of the page draws the reader’s 
attention and thus increases the chance of making a sale. Add contrast by 
using color, size, font, and so on. In Figure 14-10, you see two effective exam­
ples of call-to-action buttons: a Download It Now button from Hair Romance 
and an Add to Cart button from No Meat Athlete.

 Building an Enticing Resource Page
A Resource page contains links to articles and websites around a specific 
topic. This type of page improves the usability of your blog by providing a 
one-stop place to find the content you deem most relevant around a par­
ticular topic. If you blog about blogging, the page could include links to your 
host, the place where you buy domain names, and plug-ins that you use. If 
you blog about travel, perhaps the page includes your favorite website to buy 
airline tickets or your must-have travel apps for a smart phone.
Because a Resource page is just that — resources — the page design has a 
tendency to be quite boring. This section gives you some ideas to spruce up 
the page design and improve its appeal.
	
Part of a good blog design means your blog should always be as easy to use 
as possible. Because this page is full of awesome resources, people will want 
to share the page on social media sites. Make this easy for them by adding 
sharing buttons that enable your readers to easily share the page with their 
social media networks. See Chapter 13 for more on using sharing buttons.
Grouping related content
In Chapter 2, I talk about grouping related blog design elements to provide 
structure for the reader. The same concept applies to large amounts of 
content in your Resource page.
After you gather the resources you want to feature on your page, resist the 
impulse to simply list resources in the order you add them to the page or to 
list resources alphabetically. Instead, organize your resources into groups 
of similar content. Readers want the simplest navigation possible. When 
they visit your resources page, they’re likely looking for a certain category 
of information. For example, on a blog about taking photos, a reader might 
visit the resources page to find the blogger’s five favorite websites for buying 

258
Part IV: Creating Design-Friendly Content 
camera equipment. Whatever your blog’s topic, you provide much more 
value to your reader by grouping links in a way that allow the reader to easily 
find the desired information.
Avoiding link lists
Many Resource pages start with 
good intentions but end up being 
one really long list of links. Ack! I’ve 
seen Resource pages with literally 50 
links, one right after another. From 
an ease-of-use perspective, long lists 
with no visual breaks overwhelm the 
reader with choice and hinders the 
ability to focus on any one of them. 
Breaking up lists on your Resource 
page design simplifies the choices 
by giving readers a place to rest 
between each grouping (even with­
out removing any links).
Visually break up link lists by using 
subheadings, graphics, or dividers 
between sections. In Figure 14-11, 
the blog Leaving Work Behind (www.
leavingworkbehind.com) uses 
subheadings and colored links to 
make the list of resources organized 
and easy to follow.
Creating an Informative Advertising Page
Some bloggers never try to make money from their blog. If that’s you, then by 
all means, skip this section! However, if you want to make money from your 
blog through advertising or working on projects with companies, then having 
an Advertising page as part of your blog design is a must. Otherwise, how’s 
a company representative supposed to know you’re potentially interested in 
working with that company?
Of course, you can call this page something other than the Advertising page 
(Advertising/PR, Work with Me, Sponsorships, and so on); just make sure 
the name is obvious to the potential advertiser. You don’t want someone to 
have to search your site to find it. Creating an informative Advertising page 
means making your blog’s opportunities clear and your page design easy to 
navigate.

 Chapter 14: Designing Main Pages of Content
Showcasing your blog’s opportunities
Some bloggers prefer to include a lot of details on their Advertising page. Others 
prefer to keep it short and then direct visitors to contact them for more info. 
How much or little you include really boils down to personal preference.
You can showcase opportunities on your Advertising page through visual or 
navigation design. The following examples illustrate how you might add helpful 
images or links on your advertising page: 
	
✓	Ads in your blog or newsletter: Help the visitor visualize advertising 
opportunities by showing graphical representations of the ad sizes 
you offer. 
	
✓	Reviews or giveaways: Display thumbnail images and titles that link to 
past posts or simply provide a link with a short description.
The blog Musings of a Housewife 
(www.musingsofahousewife.
com) has a great example of a robust 
Advertising page. This Media Kit 
page uses a mix of subheadings, 
links, images, and even video to high­
light a range of opportunities (see 
Figure 14-12).
Advertisers are also typically inter­
ested in your blog stats like your 
page views, number of Facebook 
fans, and other relevant statistics 
that demonstrate your blog’s reach. 
How much detail you provide on 
your Advertising page is your call. 
Some bloggers prefer to show a 
lot of detail, while others prefer to 
save details for a media kit that they 
e-mail to a potential advertiser upon 
request.
If you include statistics on your Advertising page, make the data easy to scan. 
You could also liven up your page by using graphical elements or symbols to 
accompany the statistics (like a Twitter icon beside your number of Twitter 
followers).
Selling ad space directly from your blog
For some bloggers, selling ads directly from your Advertising page makes 
sense as a great, hassle-free option. Instead of managing the advertising

advertisers by showing a wide range of

Part IV: Creating Design-Friendly Content 
process manually — e-mailing advertisers back and forth, managing payments, 
and placing the ads on your blog — you sell ads through an application that 
handles the advertising for you. Incorporating this into your Advertising page 
design lets your potential advertiser easily purchase an ad from your site with 
less administration from you.
Setting up a way to sell ads directly from your Advertising page is easier than 
you might think. Two options to consider are
	
✓	Skyscraper: www.skyscraper.io
	
✓	Passionfruit: https://app.passionfruitads.com
They work on any blog platform, from WordPress to Blogger to Tumblr, and 
take a fee each time you sell an ad on your blog.
As you can see in Figure 14-13, 
Passionfruit Ads let you set up a 
professional-looking shop for adver­
tisers to purchase ads on your 
blog. Choose how many ads you 
want, provide descriptions for each 
one, and set advertising terms like 
how long the ads run. To display 
Passionfruit Ads on your Advertising 
page, you simply paste the code that 
Passionfruit provides into your page, 
and the advertising shop displays on 
your blog. On WordPress.org, go to 
edit the page in which you want to 
add the advertising shop, click the 
Text tab, and paste the code into 
the page’s content area. On Blogger, 
click the HTML button from the post 
editing page, and then paste the code 
into the page’s content area.
If you decide to use an app like this to sell advertising for your blog, take a 
few minutes to customize the colors to match the rest of your blog. Refer to 
your blog’s style guide (see Chapter 4) to get the color hex codes for your 
blog design colors.
Making Yourself Available with a Contact Page
A Contact page provides a place for someone to get directly in touch with 
you. Most bloggers include a Contact page in a navigation menu although 
sometimes you might find it in a footer, more like a typical company website. 
Figure 14-13: Use an advertising shop to run 
your ads.

261
 Chapter 14: Designing Main Pages of Content
After your About page, adding a Contact page to your blog design should be 
your next priority — it’s that important.
	
Although visual design can add a great branded touch to your Contact page, 
your page design should focus on usability. After all, you want to make getting 
in touch with you easy-peasy. This section walks you through a couple of 
things to consider when putting together your Contact page design.
Providing multiple ways to contact you
You might wonder who will actually use your Contact page to communicate 
with you. Your readers may want to tell you how much they adore you, ask 
you a question, or give you feedback on something. A company brand or PR 
representative may want to see whether you’ll work with them on a new cam­
paign. A reporter may even want to see whether you’re available to interview 
for a story. With so many different people to consider, it helps to include at 
least a couple of ways to contact you within your Contact page design.
The most common options to offer are an e-mail address and a contact form. 
When using an e-mail address, enhance the navigation design by making it an 
active link. That way, a visitor can just click the e-mail address, and it opens a 
new message in their e-mail application.
	
You can do this by clicking the hyperlink button in your blog post’s Visual 
Editor and writing mailto:name@email.com instead of listing a URL.
For contact forms, you have many options, from plug-ins for WordPress to 
apps for just about any blogging platform. Here are a few choices:
	
✓	Wufoo: free and paid versions; most platforms
www.wufoo.com
	
✓	Kontactr: free; most platforms
http://kontactr.com
	
✓	Google Forms: drive.google.com/forms free; any platform

plenty of options to contact him without making the choices too overwhelming.

Figure 14-14: Use a clean, effective Contact page.
Minimizing distractions to encourage communication
A Contact page’s primary purpose is to give someone an easy, obvious way 
to contact you. Resist the urge to clutter up the space or making things 
overly fancy from a design standpoint.
If you include a contact form, try not to ask for too much information lest you 
deter someone from filling it out. You might even remove the sidebar from 
your Contact page so a visitor can concentrate fully on contacting you.
	
Good blog design means making your blog easy to use and functional.
On the opposite end of the spectrum, don’t use create a Contact page with just 
one sentence. This makes the page look too vacant from a design standpoint 
and can give the impression you’re indifferent about readers contacting you.
Jennifer from Everyday Bright (http://everydaybright.com) keeps her 
Contact page free from distractions (see Figure 14-15). Her social media com­
munication channels are at the top, and her contact form sits underneath.

P

eople’s time — and thus attention — is so fragmented these days. 
People bounce from blog to blog and social media network to network, 
not to mention spending time online to do product research, check their 
bank account, or find their closest gym.
In the online world, you’ll often hear, “Content is king.” Images are content 
too. They play a huge role in grabbing a reader’s attention and should play a 
huge role in your blog design. Images can support your opinion, illustrate a 
how-to explanation, or fuel your story with emotion. Strong images also help 
build your blog brand’s look and feel and guide readers through your site.
Think about it. Would you flip through a magazine if there were no images? 
Probably not. Like magazines, blogs come alive with images.
Images aren’t just important when someone is actually on your blog. With the 
rise of social media platforms like Pinterest and Instagram, and reading apps 
like Flipboard, great imagery that gets shared from your blog posts also gives 
you a chance to capture someone’s attention outside the realm of your blog.
Of course, working with the images you want to use in your blog design 
does take time — sometimes a great deal of time. In this chapter, I walk you 
through the ins and outs of choosing images for your blog, including websites 
that offer a great selection. I also tell you about the various software tools 
available for working with images and making simple edits. I even touch on 
using vector images. So enough with the words. Get ready to find out about 
images.

Part IV: Creating Design-Friendly Content 
Finding Photos for Your Blog
Finding quality photos you can actually use on your blog isn’t always easy. In 
fact, I’d say that many bloggers know photos are important but don’t include 
as many as they could just because finding and prepping photos can be so 
time-consuming.
Having a few go-to resources for photos helps tremendously. Whether your 
blog design calls for using a photo for a blog post or elsewhere on your blog, 
this section walks you through options for finding photos and how to make 
sure you’re using them with proper permission.
Knowing the anatomy of a good photo
	
A high-quality photo enhances your blog design. Conversely, a poor-quality 
photo detracts from your design. Even if you’re sourcing the photo rather 
than using your own, it’s important to recognize quality. (See the sidebar, 
“Avoiding poor photo quality.”)
In the following list, I share the basic elements of a great photo:
	
✓	Good composition: Composition 
refers to how elements within 
a photo are set up. Sometimes 
you plan the composition: for 
example, when you photograph 
a plate of mouth-watering food. 
Other times, you resort to light­
ning-fast composition, such as 
when snapping a great shot of a 
running toddler.
	
	Use photographic elements like 
lines, patterns, and balance to 
create interesting photos. One 
of the most tried-and-true ways 
to compose a photograph for greater visual interest is the Rule of Thirds. 
In this method of composition, you imagine the image divided into 
thirds, both horizontally and vertically. When taking a photo (or finding 
one to use), ensure the point of interest lands at the intersection of one 
of the thirds, as shown in Figure 15-1.
	
✓	Good lighting: When you use a built-in flash or shoot photos in low 
light conditions, your photos can lack the oomph that your blog design 
needs. A well-lit photograph keeps the focus on its subject and doesn’t 
distract blog readers from the point of the image. Harsh shadows or 
overlit sections of a photograph can often make or break your ability to 
entice the readers, make an emotional connection, or aid in a tutorial. 
Figure 15-1: The elephant’s face hits around 
one of the grid intersections.

267
 Chapter 15: Working with Images
Take a look at the two images in Figure 15-2 for an example. Which food 
would you rather eat?
	
	If you take your own images, try to take images in early morning or 
early evening, when the natural light is best. If you’re indoors, look for a 
natural light source, such as a window. Try not to use your built-in flash 
indoors, even in low light. They’re notorious for overlighting your photo 
or giving people the dreaded red eyes. Because low light requires that 
the camera’s shutter stay open longer to let in more light, try setting up 
a tripod or place your camera on a flat surface. Then, use a self-timer 
to take the photo, which prevents camera shake that can occur when 
you’re holding your camera (or even pressing down the shutter button), 
helping you take a crisper shot.
	
✓	Emphasis on the subject: Who or what is the subject of your photo­
graph? What is the story you’re trying to tell? If your subject is your dog, 
then get close to minimize a distracting background. However, if you 
want to show how your dog loves nature, step back so you can show 
him trotting down a hiking trail. No matter what you write about, your 
blog posts are where you tell stories, educate, inspire, and more. Make 
sure your photos align to that purpose.

Beyond what I’ve covered here, other, more technical factors come into play 
when you’re talking about good photographs such as focus and exposure. For 
more details on composing great photographs, check out Digital Photography 
For Dummies, 7th Edition by Julie Adair King.
Using your own photos
Using your own photos is the easiest choice, especially if you have a lifestyle 
or memoir-type blog. Getting photos this way is free (minus the camera equip­
ment), you don’t have to worry about copyright issues, and you can get pre­
cisely the images you want. (Important: Read more about copyright issues 
in the upcoming section, “Understanding permissions.”) Hundreds of people 
could be using that photo you just downloaded from Flickr, so perhaps the big­
gest benefit of using your own photo is that your photo is unique.

268
Part IV: Creating Design-Friendly Content 
Avoiding poor photo quality
Photos help bring your blog to life, but using 
poor quality photos can be worse than having 
none at all. Good images show professionalism 
and strengthen branding for your design. Bad 
images have the opposite effect.
Poor-quality images can occur because of the 
way the picture was manipulated in image editing 
software. Here are two frequently seen mistakes:
	✓	Pixilation/blurriness: Pixels are all the tiny 
dots that make up an image. When you 
make an image smaller, the photo quality 
remains because photo-editing programs 
know which pixels to throw away. However, 
if you make a picture larger than the origi­
nal, photo-editing programs just add pixels 
to fill in the spaces. If you increase the 
image too much, pixels start to look blurry or 
like squares, as in this image — and that’s 
pixilation.
	
	 In some cases, you can actually use pixila­
tion on purpose if you’re trying to blur part 
of a photograph, such as nudity or some­
one who wants to be anonymous in your 
photo. In that case, you can easily tell the 
pixilation is used for an effect, instead of a 
mistake. The simplest fix is to keep images 
within the confines of the original size by 
going smaller. If you must go larger, keep a 
close eye on the image to ensure the quality 
doesn’t diminish too far from the original.
	✓	Distortion: When manipulating an image, 
you may accidentally “stretch it,” making 
the objects in the image disproportional. 
Sometimes this occurs when editing an 
image in a photo-editing program. However, 
distortion can also occur if you place an 
image into a space that isn’t proportional 
to your image size, such as trying to fit 
a square image into a wide and narrow 
header. Distortion always looks the worst 
with people, stretching them as if they’re 
standing in front of a funhouse mirror. 
Distorted images look amateurish, so 
always maintain proportions when resiz­
ing an image. In many programs, you can 
maintain the image’s proportions by holding 
down the Shift key as you drag the corner of 
an image when resizing it.

 Chapter 15: Working with Images
Even if you use your own photos, image quality still needs to be top notch. 
To accomplish this, you don’t need a fancy, expensive dSLR camera. You can 
take great photos on a basic point-and-shoot camera, or even on a built-in 
camera on your phone. For example, Elan Morgan takes wonderful pictures 
from her iPhone to use on her blog Schmutzie (www.schmutzie.com), 
shown in Figure 15-3. See the sidebar “Avoiding poor photo quality” for more 
about photo quality.

Figure 15-3: You can use an inexpensive camera for your blog images.
Using images from other sources
Using your own images doesn’t always make sense for a blog post. For example, 
if you’re writing about a Twitter tip, taking a relevant photo might be a challenge. 
You also might decide that you’re not the best photographer and would rather 
use an image from someone else. Whatever the reason, the Internet is full of 
places to find stock images that you can legitimately use on your blog.
A stock image is a photograph licensed for public or commercial use. You find 
stock images in online databases that users can search by keyword, category, 
and so on to locate the right image. Some stock images are free, and some 
you have to pay to use.
The biggest benefit of free images is, well, they’re free. Having said that, 
many come with a requirement to attribute the image in some way, such as 
linking back to the owner. Although you should never skimp on doing so, you 

270
Part IV: Creating Design-Friendly Content 
may not find this situation ideal if you’re trying to use an image in your blog 
header or if you want your page to feel more branded. In that case, there’s 
the option to pay for images.
	
Purchasing images often means you receive a higher-quality image (but not 
always). In addition, although you may not be the only person using that 
image, chances are that fewer people are using it (than if it were a free photo).
On my blog, I use a mix of both. I typically start by searching for a free image. 
Then, if I don’t find what I’m looking for rather quickly, I move to paying for a 
small image size for web use.
Here are some popular sites for free images:
	
✓	Stock.XCHNG: www.sxc.hu
	
✓	Flickr Creative Commons: www.flickr.com/creativecommons
	
✓	Image Base: http://www.imagebase.net
	
✓	FreeFoto: www.freefoto.com/index.jsp
	
✓	Stock Free Images: www.stockfreeimages.com
When purchasing images, some sites require you to buy credits instead of 
purchasing images individually. You purchase a minimum amount of credits, 
and then each size of an image costs a different number of credits. The more 
credits you buy at a time, the less expensive each image becomes. Here are 
some popular sites for purchasing images:
	
✓	iStockphoto: www.istockphoto.com
	
	See Figure 15-4.
	
✓	Veer: www.veer.com
	
✓	Bigstock: www.bigstock.com
	
✓	PhotoXpress: www.photoxpress.com
	
✓	Fotolia: http://us.fotolia.com
All these paid sites have advanced search options so you can search by key­
word, image orientation, and more. For example, the iStockphoto advanced 
search options let you search by hex code or by marking where you want to 
place text on a photo. Read more about hex codes in Chapter 6.
	
If you’re on the WordPress.org platform, take advantage of photo-finding plug-
ins. These plug-ins find relevant images based on your keyword, and then add 
them to your blog post while automatically linking to the source. Some of the 
more popular ones include Photo Dropper, Zemanta, and Flickr Photo Post.

271
 Chapter 15: Working with Images
Figure 15-4: Fee-based stock photo houses are another option for obtaining images.
Understanding permissions
	
Just because an image is on the Internet doesn’t mean you have free reign to 
use however you wish. All images are copyrighted, so when using the paid 
and free options for finding images, you need to understand what permission 
you have to use the work.
A copyright legally protects original works of authorship. That could be a photo, 
graphic design, writing, piece of music, or other type of creative work. Unlike 
trademarks or patents, copyrights don’t require additional paperwork. In the 
U.S., copyright attaches to a piece of work as soon as you create it.
As a general rule, you can’t use a copyrighted work without permission from 
the owner. This means that you can’t just use an image from another website 
(or a place like Google Images) and then credit that person by linking to them. 
The same goes for right-clicking an image from a website and saving it to 
your computer. Giving credit isn’t the same as getting permission.
With paid images, you generally don’t need to attribute back to the owner 
because you’ve essentially purchased the right to use the image. However, 
before you purchase an image or use one for free, you should always read the 
licensing agreement.

272
Part IV: Creating Design-Friendly Content 
Free images may require you to link to the source of the image, but you may 
not be able to use a free or paid photo for commercial use. If you want to 
purchase an image to use in your blog header design but you also want 
to make t-shirts to sell with your blog header on them, you might need an 
extended license. There are a myriad of other potential requirements, so read 
the license agreement before you use a particular image.
Editing Photos
Photos are rarely perfect right out of the camera. In fact, you’d probably be 
surprised to see unedited versions of some of your favorite photos.
To get the most out of your pictures, you’ll want to edit them in some small 
(or big) way. Editing photos can range from simple things like removing clut­
ter by cropping, to more advanced techniques like adding creative effects. 
I’m certainly no photo-editing professional, but I often find that just a small 
tweak can make a photo go from mediocre to awesome. For the more adven­
turous, you can find many For Dummies books on digital photography, cam­
eras, and photo-editing programs. Visit www.dummies.com.
Choosing photo-editing software
When it comes to making a choice for photo-editing software, you have quite 
a few options that vary widely in price and learning curve. What you choose 
ultimately boils down to how much you want to spend and how much editing 
you plan to do.
If you’re looking for basic features — say, resizing, cropping, and adjusting 
contrast or balance — you can probably get by with a free or almost free pro­
gram. If you’re looking for (or are eager to learn) more advanced features — 
creating paths, using masks, and working in layers — you’ll need more 
complex software with a higher price tag.
Many bloggers might not want to invest in pricey software, so I cover the 
free web-based software PicMonkey (www.picmonkey.com) in this book 
(see Figure 15-5). PicMonkey describes itself as “the world’s friendliest photo 
editor,” which might be true! (Many bloggers moved to PicMonkey when 
Google’s Picnik went the way of the dodo bird.) There’s no software to install 
because PicMonkey is web-based. Just browse to the PicMonkey web page, 
upload a photo, and get to work.

273
 Chapter 15: Working with Images
Figure 15-5: PicMonkey is an easy-to-use photo-editing option for bloggers.
Of course, they are many, many other choices aside from PicMonkey. Here 
are just a few:
	
✓	Adobe Photoshop
www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html
	
	Mac and PC. Photoshop is the industry standard in photo-editing soft­
ware and is ideal for professional photographers or serious amateurs. 
Along with the myriad of features that come built in, you can also add 
brushes, plug-ins, patterns, and color swatches for even greater func­
tionality. There’s a definite learning curve, but Photoshop can do just 
about everything you’d want it to.
	
✓	Adobe Photoshop Elements
www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-elements.html
	
	Mac and PC. According to the NPD Group/Retail Tracking Service, this 
program is the best-selling consumer photo-editing software in the 
United States. This program has many features similar to the more 
expensive Photoshop but is geared more for someone who doesn’t need 
advanced features. It does have a learning curve, although not as steep 
as full-fledged Photoshop, so Photoshop Elements is a good stepping 
stone from basic to high-end software.
	
✓	Corel PaintShop Photo Pro X5
www.corel.com/corel/product/index.jsp?pid=prod4900067
	
	PC only. PaintShop Photo Pro X5 is a rival to Photoshop but at a lower 
price point. It has less image-processing power and fewer features, but 

274
Part IV: Creating Design-Friendly Content 
some users consider this program more user-friendly than Photoshop. 
It’s also more geared toward the average consumer.
	
✓	Picasa
http://picasa.google.com
	
	Mac and PC. Picasa is a Google photo-editing application. You can do 
basic editing or apply effects in an easy-to-use interface. You might also 
find this program good for organizing your photos and using as a photo-
sharing tool.
	
✓	GIMP
www.gimp.org
	
	Mac. GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program) enables you do many of 
the same things as Photoshop but isn’t as user-friendly to use. GIMP is 
a popular choice for those who don’t want to invest in Photoshop, but 
it’s hard to compare the two given that GIMP is free, and Photoshop is 
among the more expensive image-editing programs available. 
Choosing the right file format
No matter what program you use to create blog design elements, at some 
point you have to save them in a file format that can be displayed on the web. 
When it comes to web graphics, you only need to worry about three file for­
mats: JPEG, PNG, and GIF. Each of them serve different roles, so this section 
explains when you should use each of them and why.
Before I get to that, you need to understand two data compression techniques:
	
✓	Lossy compression reduces file size by getting rid of (losing) some of the 
file’s data. JPEGs use lossy compression. For example, if you resize a 
photo from 500 x 500 pixels down to 200 x 200 pixels, the compression 
throws out data to make the file smaller. If you try to change that 
200-x-200-pixel image back to its original size, the image quality won’t be 
the same, because data from the original file is now gone.
	
✓	Lossless compression reduces file size without getting rid of any file 
data. Because no data is thrown out, a file is typically larger than its JPG 
equivalent. PNGs and GIFs use lossless compression. For example, if you 
resize a 500-x-500-pixel illustration down to 200 x 200 pixels, you can 
then change the size back without any change in quality. The data can 
be reconstructed exactly as it was. 
	
Table 15-1 lists each file format, the compression type, and when to use that 
particular file format. If you’re ever unsure what format in which to save your 
design, just flip to this table.

Large file sizes increase your blog’s loading time. If you need to further reduce 
the size of a JPEG, PNG, or GIF, try Puny PNG (http://punypng.com), a free 
web optimization tool that reduces image file size without any loss in quality.
Resizing photos
When you download photos from your camera to your computer, the photos 
are almost always too big to use on your blog, because they’re taken at a 
resolution suitable for printing. The screens people use to view images on 
the web need a much lower resolution than print. Also, large images slow 
down your blog’s loading time. So, before you upload photos to your blog, 
you need to resize them.
To resize a photo in PicMonkey, follow these steps:
	
1.	Go to the PicMonkey website (www.picmonkey.com).
	
2.	Click the text that reads Edit a Photo (at the top of the interface).
	
	 A window pops up to let you select the photo you want to use.
	
3.	Select a photo and click Open.
	
4.	On the menu of Basic Edits, select Resize at the bottom of the list.
	
	 The numbers that populate in the Change Size To fields are the current 
width and height of your image in pixels.
	
5.	Type new pixel numbers in the Change Size To field.
	
	 You have two additional options to adjust the size of your image, as 
shown in Figure 15-6:
	
•	Use Percentages: Select this check box to change the units from 
pixels to percentages. You can resize from there.
	
•	Keep Proportions: Selecting this option allows you to enter an 
amount for width or for height, and the other amount will auto­
matically adjust to maintain the proportion of the image.

276
Part IV: Creating Design-Friendly Content 
Figure 15-6: PicMonkey allows you to resize images in proportion.
	
6.	When you get the image to the size you’d like, click the Apply button.
	
7.	Click Save (above the image) and save the image to your computer.
	
	 Be sure not to close your browser window before you save the image, or 
you’ll lose all your edits.
	
To save time, resize images for your posts in batches. Although you can’t do 
this in PicMonkey, you can try a free resizing tool such as Fotosizer (www.
fotosizer.com). If you use a program like Adobe Photoshop, you can create 
an Action that will automatically resize images to a size that you select.
Cropping photos
Cropping means trimming unnecessary portions of an image’s outer area. 
Cropping is one of the easiest ways to enhance an image. You may want to crop 
an image to
	
✓	Remove clutter in the background.
	
✓	Fit an image into a space with different proportions, such as placing a 
rectangular image into a square.
	
✓	Showcase a particular portion of that image.
Follow these simple steps to crop an image in PicMonkey:
	
1.	Go to the PicMonkey website (www.picmonkey.com).
	
2.	Click the text that reads Edit a Photo (at the top of the interface). 
	
	 A window pops up to let you select the photo you want to use.

277
 Chapter 15: Working with Images
	
3.	Select the photo you want to crop and click Open.
	
	 The photo opens, ready for editing.
	
4.	Select the Crop tool from the list of options.
	
	 A cropping box automatically appears with four circles at each corner, 
as shown in Figure 15-7.
Figure 15-7: The cropping box shows you how the image will look 
before you crop it.
	
5.	Choose your proportions.
	
	 Here are a few of the options you’ll see:
	
•	No Fixed Proportions allows you to enlarge or shrink the cropping 
box without being confined to a certain shape. As you adjust the 
box, the image dimensions shown in the Actual Size fields change 
automatically.
	
•	Original Proportions confines the image you’re cropping to the origi­
nal file proportions even though the actual image size gets smaller.
	
•	Facebook Timeline sets the cropping box to proportions that will 
fit as a Facebook Timeline cover photo.
	
	 You even have settings for common desktop screen sizes and iPhone 
screens. Sweet!
	
6.	Select the area you want to keep.
	
	 You can select this area in two ways:
	
•	Click any corner of the cropping box and move in any direction.
	
•	Click anywhere on the inside of the cropping box to move the 
entire box.

278
Part IV: Creating Design-Friendly Content 
	
	 After you make your selection, 
the area you want to crop from 
your image becomes shaded. If 
you need to undo the area you 
selected to crop, click the left-
pointing arrow above the image 
or readjust using either of the 
preceding techniques.
	
7.	Click the Apply button to crop 
your image.
	
8.	Click Save to save the image 
onto your computer.
In Figure 15-8, you can see the 
cropped version of this image. The 
cropping changed the orientation 
from landscape to portrait and 
removed someone’s head from the 
bottom edge to improve the image 
composition.
Using Images in Your Blog Posts
You can place images just about anywhere on your blog: a special blog page, 
header, sidebar, and so on. Aside from the prominent blog header, the heart 
of imagery in your blog design lies within your blog posts.
As I mention in Chapter 2, images serve to grab the readers’ attention. As you 
include imagery throughout your post, they pull readers deeper into your 
content. Images also make your blog post more memorable because people 
visualize imagery more easily than text.
Whatever images you use should be relevant to your blog post, but they 
don’t have to be blatant to be effective. For example, a blog post sharing 
marathon running tips could feature a close-up image of a finish line instead 
of someone actually running a marathon.
Images in your blog posts also help drive traffic from social networking sites. 
When readers share your posts on sites like Pinterest or Facebook, those 
sites let your readers select an image to display with the link to your post. An 
image relevant to your post will garner more traffic than just your blog’s logo 
or header.
Figure 15-8: Cropping this image removed 
background clutter that didn’t help tell this 
photo’s story.

279
 Chapter 15: Working with Images
Deciding where to place images within a post
Deciding where images should go within your blog posts plays an important 
role in your overall blog design. When a new reader lands on your blog, you 
need a point in your post that can immediately catch their eye. To do that, 
always try to place one image above the fold of your blog design, which is the 
point where the visitor must scroll down to see more. An image above the 
fold of your design becomes a teaser of sorts, enticing the reader to scroll 
down to see (and read) more past the blog post title.
	
If the only image that can potentially be seen above the fold is your blog 
header, your header size might be too large. Refer to Chapter 7 where I talk 
about effective header sizes and offer tips on a well-sized blog header.
As the story or purpose of your post develops in the text, images should 
reinforce the information the text conveys and break up the text as readers 
continue through your post. Images deeper within a post create a visual path 
through your posts in a way that text alone just can’t do. 
Images also provide clarity to your readers. For example, if you’re working 
through a how-to explanation, such as a craft or software tutorial, showing 
images of steps along the way (as shown in Figure 15-9) makes each step 
much easier to understand than just showing the end result.
	
Don’t go overboard with images. Maybe only one image is enough for your 
post. If that’s the case, just format your text in a way that easily moves read­
ers through your post. I give you all sorts of ways to format blog post text in 
Chapter 16.
Figure 15-9: Illustrating a step of a craft tutorial can help your readers.

Part IV: Creating Design-Friendly Content 
Properly sizing images
When incorporating images into 
your blog posts, you not only want 
some visual oomph, but you want to 
ensure that those images don’t slow 
down your page-loading time.
Before you even insert images into 
your blog post, edit the image size in 
your photo-editing software so that 
the image fits within the column of 
your blog post. If your column width 
is 600 pixels (px) but your original 
image is 800 px, the image stretches 
into another column, like what you 
can see in Figure 15-10.
As a fix, you could resize large images 
within your blog post — but, you affect 
your blog’s loading time because you 
still uploaded the original size. Only 
make small sizing adjustments within your blog. You can adjust image sizes out­
side your blog by following the steps in the section “Resizing photos.”
As a starting point, I typically size my photos to the width of my blog post. I 
can then resize as needed, such as for portrait-oriented photos. For example, 
if the shorter side of a portrait-oriented photo runs the entire blog width, the 
photo would be gigantic. So I know to always resize those.
On the other end of the spectrum, 
bloggers often makes the mistake 
of using teeny-tiny images in their 
blog posts, which detract from your 
overall blog design and decrease 
the image’s ability to make a state­
ment. Your readers actually want 
to see your images, so make them 
large enough to see!
Some bloggers prefer to wrap text 
around their images, as shown in 
Figure 15-11. This comes in handy if 
you want to show a smaller image 
like a headshot as part of a bio or 
an icon that should accompany a 
piece of text. Whether you do that 
for your other images is really just a 
matter of preference.
Figure 15-10: Having a picture stretch into the 
sidebar looks messy, covering up elements in 
the sidebar.
Figure 15-11: Wrap text around an image for 
visual appeal.

281
 Chapter 15: Working with Images
In most blogging platforms, wrap­
ping text simply involves selecting 
an available wrapping style when 
placing an image into a post. You (or 
your designer) can adjust how much 
space to use between the image 
border and the text by making adjust­
ments within your cascading style 
sheet (CSS).
	
Avoid wrapping text around images 
in a way that produces a jarring 
effect. For example, when two images 
in close proximity wrap on different 
sides of your blog post (see Figure 
15-12), content can become cramped 
between the images, making your 
blog post hard to read.
	
I recommend keeping images within 
your post further apart or aligning 
images to a certain side. Check your 
blog post layout in preview mode 
before you publish to ensure that 
your images don’t hinder readability.
Naming image files
Have you ever used an image on 
your blog with a totally unhelp­
ful filename like DSC001.jpg or 
Image01.png? Well, this section is 
for you! Get onboard because properly naming images helps with blog navi­
gation design, search engine optimization (SEO), and more.
When working in the back end of your blog, you can more easily find an 
image you’re looking for when the image has a descriptive name. In addition, 
you end up with shorter, cleaner image URLs.
For SEO, using good file names become critical. In a search engine’s eyes, a 
name like DSC001.jpg says nothing about what the image really contains.
	
Search engines can’t see pictures, but they can see filenames.
And image names don’t just matter for search engines and your blog. Sites 
like Pinterest can be a huge drivers of traffic, depending on the type of 
content you produce. If someone pins your image to their Pinterest board, 
Figure 15-12: Too many images can look 
awkward and interrupt word flow.

282
Part IV: Creating Design-Friendly Content 
Pinterest might automatically pull the image name into the pin description. 
People like to pin quickly and might not bother to change DSC001.jpg to 
something more descriptive and helpful. You could lose out on some mega 
traffic from a simple oversight.
Naming your images the right way doesn’t have to be difficult though. Here 
are my tips:
	
✓	Name your files using a keyword that’s related to the content of your 
image or blog post. Don’t get spammy, though, and stuff your image 
name with lots of keywords. For example, if you wrote a blog post on 
puppy training and you have an image of a dog shaking your hand, then 
the file name puppy-training-shaking-hands.jpg is better than 
puppy-training-dog-training-tricks-shaking-hands.jpg.
	
✓	Keep filenames relatively short. That way, they’re easier to remember or 
to copy and paste them elsewhere.
	
✓	Use hyphens between words to make the image name easier to read.
	
✓	Stick with naming the file with just words (or a mix of words and numbers) 
rather than including special characters or using only numbers.
	
✓	Avoid using spaces in your image names. The link to an image named 
homemade apple pie.jpg will show up as /homemade%20apple%20
pie.jpg, which is not as easy to read.
	
If you don’t share certain personal information on your blog — such as kids’ 
names, your last name, or the city you’re from — leave that out of your filename, 
too. Otherwise, that information is visible to anyone.
Showcasing Multiple Images within a Post
People love images. Blog readers love images (after all, they’re people). But how 
do you decide how many to include? And when you’ve figured that out, how 
can you showcase them in a visually appealing way?
Deciding how many images to include
More images in your blog post doesn’t always equal better. Few people want 
to scroll and scroll through image after image of your latest vacation, no 
matter how spectacular your vacation was. However, when the images are 
your own, you might have a hard time deciding which images to cut out.

283
 Chapter 15: Working with Images
When narrowing down photos from an event, consider removing photos that 
include unflattering facial expressions, show distracting clutter (that can’t be 
cropped out), or appear too similar to another photo. Instead, select images 
that capture emotion, are well focused, and best help tell your story.
When deciding how many photos to include in a post about something else, my 
best advice is to include as many images as it takes to get your point across. 
For example, a 20-step tutorial may not need an image for every step, but a 
review of five top gifts for kids might need an image to showcase each product.
After you narrow down your images, you may have the right balance of 
images and text for your blog post. If you still have too many images, con­
sider displaying a group together in a collage or photo gallery.
Creating a photo collage
A photo collage is basically just a composition of many photos. On a blog, 
a collage allows you to present more images in a smaller space than they’d 
take up if you inserted them one after another in a blog post. Collages can 
also make looking a multiple images more enticing, whether they’re in your 
blog post or elsewhere in your blog’s design.
Like just about anything design-related, you have oodles of options for cre­
ating a collage. You can create one in a program like Picasa or Photoshop. 
However, I default again to PicMonkey (it must be that cute monkey). Here’s 
how to create a collage using PicMonkey:
	
1.	Go to PicMonkey (www.picmonkey.com).
	
2.	Click the text that reads Create Collage (at the top of the interface).
	
3.	Select Upload Photos to choose your photos.
	
	At this point, a window will open where you can select the images 
that you want to use in your collage. Select multiple images at once by 
holding down Shift if they’re grouped together. If they aren’t grouped 
together, simply hold down the Ctrl key on a PC or the Command key on 
a Mac while you click to select files.
	
4.	Select a collage layout by clicking the Layouts tab on the far left of 
your screen, as shown in Figure 15-13.
	
	 You have many types of options here with fun names, such as Biggie 
Smalls and L-egant. Move your cursor over one of the options, and a 
sample of the layout appears. Clicking a selection shows you a number 
of options with that type of layout.

284
Part IV: Creating Design-Friendly Content 
Figure 15-13: PicMonkey gives you many collage template options as 
a starting point.
	
5.	Select your template.
	
6.	Adjust the collage dimensions to a size that fits within your blog post.
	
	 You can find the dimension directly underneath the collage area. Be 
sure to input the number as pixels.
	
7.	Add one of your images to the collage by simply dragging the image from 
the Images tab into a frame within the template and dropping it in.
	
	 After you place the image, you can move around the image within that 
frame. You just can’t zoom into the image at all to create a tighter crop.
	
	 If you want PicMonkey to take a stab at laying out your collage, select 
the Autofill feature, sit back, and let the monkey do the work. You may 
just save yourself some time!
	
8.	(Optional) If you fill in all the frames with images and decide you want 
to add another image, drag that image to a place of white space where 
you’d like the photo to be placed — but not on top of an existing image.
	
	 When you do this, two lines appear to denote the image will be placed 
in that spot, as shown in Figure 15-14. Release the mouse to let go of the 
image, and it drops into the collage and resizes all the other images to 
make room.
	
9.	After you build your collage to your liking, click the Save button 
(above the collage).
	
	 Then you can name the collage, and select a file type and image quality. 
Save it somewhere on your computer that you’ll remember, and you’re 
done! Figure 15-15 shows a finished collage created in PicMonkey.

Adding a gallery
Sometimes you might want to dis­
play your images more dynamically 
than a collage. That’s where galler­
ies come in. A gallery is a way to 
showcase multiple pictures, where 
each image can be clicked. Clicking 
that image can show a larger version 
of the image or can direct someone 
to another part of your blog. You 
can include a gallery as part of your 
overall blog design, within a blog 
post, or even within special pages, 
such as a resource or recipe page.
WordPress has a very simple built-
in gallery feature for blog posts. 
However, most people want more 
than the built-in gallery. That’s where 
the following options come in.
I present a lot of choices because, well, you have many free and premium 
options. WordPress.org will give you the majority of choices, but the first 
option lets bloggers on any platform create galleries from Facebook albums, 
Flickr, or Picasa.

Working with Illustrations
For most of this chapter, I focus (ha!) on photos because every blogger uses 
(or should use) photos. But what about illustrations?
You might think you need to be artistic to work illustrations into your blog 
design. Not true! For example, I’m more comfortable manipulating illustra­
tions rather than designing them from scratch. I purchase illustrations and 
then combine them into a design, like I did on my blog header for Adventuroo 
(see Figure 15-16). I designed this blog header using two sets of illustrations. I 
then adjusted colors, removed trees, added animals, and overlaid it with text 
to create a custom look.
Figure 15-16: I made this blog header by combining and manipulating two sets of illustrations.
With illustrations, you can make custom social media buttons, abstract pat­
terns or backgrounds, icons, and more. This section will give you a basic 
overview of illustrations, also known as vector images.
Getting to know vector images
Vector images are decidedly not photographs. Vector images are illustrations 
with lines and points. Think about how you draw something on paper. You 

287
 Chapter 15: Working with Images
wouldn’t create a star using hundreds of tiny dots, like a photo has. You draw 
the star using lines and points. When it comes to computer graphics, that’s a 
vector.
And you know how photographs can get fuzzy when you increase their size 
too much from the original? That doesn’t happen with vector-based images 
because they’re defined by math rather than pixels, so you can scale them up 
(or down) without any quality loss. Bonus: Vector images also are smaller file 
sizes than files made up of pixels.
Because of this scalability, quality logos are always done as vectors. They 
can be easily edited without affecting the quality. For example, if you have 
only an image of your logo in JPEG format, you can’t change the color, 
increase the font size, or anything else. With a vector, though, you can — and 
then export the image into a JPEG for web use.
Here are some common file formats you’ll see for vectors:
	
✓	Encapsulated Post Script (EPS)
	
✓	Adobe Illustrator (AI)
	
✓	CorelDRAW (CDR)
	
✓	Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)
Vector files need to be opened in vector-based software. That means you’ll 
need to convert a vector image to a rasterized file (that is, one with pixels, 
like a JPEG) in order to use the image on your blog.
Vector images can usually be purchased at the same places you find stock 
imagery. (See the section, “Using images from other sources.”) You can also 
find them at sites like these:
	
✓	VectorStock: www.vectorstock.com
	
✓	Vecteezy: www.vecteezy.com
	
✓	QVectors: http://qvectors.net
Choosing vector-based software
Vector programs aren’t as intuitive to use as some image-editing programs. If 
you work with a blog designer for your vector-based designs or you want to 
learn only a few basics, I recommend sticking with a free vector-based soft­
ware like Inkscape. I should at least tell you about the two most well-known 
paid vector programs:

288
Part IV: Creating Design-Friendly Content 
	
✓	Adobe Illustrator: The most popular for-fee vector-based program, it’s 
hands-down the standard for vector designs.
www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html
	
✓	CorelDRAW Graphics Suite X6: A powerful competitor to Illustrator.
www.corel.com/corel/product/index.jsp?pid=prod4260069
For those looking for a free solution, Inkscape (http://inkscape.org) 
is one of your only options. Inkscape allows you to create drawings using 
pencil, pen, and calligraphy tools; manipulate objects; use paths; and more.
Creating a simple vector graphic
Most people have edited a photograph, but vector graphics are probably 
strange, new territory, so I want to show you a quick Inkscape example on 
how to create a cloud icon. Then, you could use an icon to highlight a special 
section on your blog or to create a social media button by placing a social 
media logo on top of that cloud within the illustration.
	
1.	Browse to Inkscape (http://inkscape.org) and create a new icon 
by choosing File➪New➪icon_64x64.
	
2.	On the toolbar, select the Circle tool.
	
	 This allows you to create circles and ellipses.
	
3.	Draw an ellipse shape as shown in Figure 15-17.
Figure 15-17: An ellipse shape forms the basis for a cloud shape.

289
 Chapter 15: Working with Images
	
4.	Adjust the color and stroke to suit your preference.
	
•	To adjust the color: Go to Object➪Fill and Stroke. You can change the 
color in a variety of ways, from changing RGB values to selecting 
a color in a color wheel. I kept the color flat but changed it to a 
blue shade I selected from the Wheel tab.
	
•	To adjust the stroke color: Click the Stroke Paint tab. Adjust the 
stroke (outlines a shape) color to your liking.
	
5.	Create new ellipses of different sizes and arrange them to form a 
cloud shape.
	
	 Keep all ellipses the same color with the same stroke color. After you 
create the shape of your cloud, you merge all the shapes so the stroke is 
visible only on the outside of the cloud shape.
	
6.	Go to Edit➪Select All.
	
	This selects all the ellipses at once.
	
7.	Go to Path➪Union.
	
	 Union combines the separate ellipses into one single image. In Figure 15-18, 
you can see how the shapes merge into a simple cloud shape.
Figure 15-18: Separate shapes transformed into a cloud using the Union feature.
	
8.	Save illustration by choosing File➪Save.

290
Part IV: Creating Design-Friendly Content 
	
9.	To convert the icon to a format suitable for web use, choose 
File➪Export Bitmap.
	
	 This saves the image as a PNG image, which will prevent the image from 
having a white box around the cloud.

W

hen it comes to pages of content, readers see one type of page time 
and time again: your blog posts. Because blogs essentially revolve 
around those posts, working blog design into your blog posts should be a 
given. Your blog may have rock star content, but if your blog posts aren’t 
visually inviting, a visitor may skip over the content altogether.
In this chapter, I explore ways in which you can add some of your overall 
blog design into your blog posts through customizing blog post titles, styling 
block quotations, and more. This chapter also provides ideas for breaking up 
your long stretches of text with visual elements.
Banishing Long Blocks of Text
One day on Twitter, I came across a tweet about a tutorial that interested 
me. I clicked through to the blog post and started to read. While the content 
really did rock, I actually struggled reading through the entire post because 
the blogger buried the content into a few, very long paragraphs.
When it comes to blog design, getting rid of long blocks of text doesn’t often 
get the focus. However, your content is the star of your blog. Honor that con­
tent of yours by ensuring visitors can easily read each and every word should 
they choose to do so. Making your content visually easy to digest also benefits 
those people who might only scan your content. (Chapter 1 dives into more 
about how people often skim content.)

292
Part IV: Creating Design-Friendly Content 
Whether you’re writing a tutorial, recipe, story, or something else altogether, 
you can get rid of lengthy paragraphs for good, ensuring your blog posts or 
pages visually guide the reader through your content. The tips in the rest of 
this chapter show you how.
Breaking Text into Smaller Paragraphs
Publishing a blog post or page with long paragraphs isn’t often done purpose­
fully. You might be pinched for time or really excited to get your thoughts on 
“paper,” so you just write and write and write without much thought for how 
the text will actually look on your blog. The fix is simple (and I apologize if 
this advice sounds overly simplistic): Split your text into smaller paragraphs.
	
Keeping paragraphs relatively short gives readers’ minds a quick break, let­
ting them soak up your words more easily (or scan through them if they’re 
short on time). In addition, paragraph length can be a powerful way to add 
emotion to your words without even changing your writing. Try splitting 
important parts of a story into new single-sentence paragraphs to intensify 
the emotion. It pulls readers’ eyes down to keep reading more.
In Figure 16-1, notice how the text on the left looks denser than the text on 
the right. I didn’t change one single word. I just added visual breaks to the 
content.
Figure 16-1: Breaking up paragraphs gives content more impact and is easier to read.
Although separating long blocks of text into smaller paragraphs can make 
your content more readable, having a really long page of super-short para­
graphs can also hinder readability by making the content seem choppy. 
Strike a balance to bring the right flow to your content.
	
Just looking at your content within your blog platform’s visual editor isn’t 
enough to check your post or page’s readability. Before you click that Publish 
button, preview your blog post or page to see how long each paragraph 
looks on your blog. If you notice long paragraphs, break them up into smaller 
paragraphs.

293
 Chapter 16: Incorporating Design into Your Blog Posts
Using Subheadings
Subheadings serve as mini-headlines to separate your content into different 
sections. Breaking up long blocks of text by using subheadings plays a role 
in blog design, too. Subheadings impact your content’s visual design and 
usability all-in-one as follows:
	
✓	Organizing information: When you visually separate your blog post or 
page into sections, you give your readers a mental pause and a chance 
to digest your content.
	
✓	Creating hierarchy: Using subheadings provides a visual hierarchy, 
telling your reader that the subheading is important to read. This helps 
readers understand the main points of your post, even if they happen to 
just skim your post.
	
✓	Providing bookmarks: Subheadings act like bookmarks for your con­
tent. Someone returning to your post or re-reading your content can 
use subheadings as visual bookmarks to get the piece of content they’re 
looking for.
Figure 16-2 shows a blog post with and without subheadings. As you can see, 
the subheadings visually break up long blocks of text and help the reader 
better understand the content.
Figure 16-2: Blog content with subheadings is easier to follow.
When talking subheadings, you probably think mostly about one level of 
subheadings within your blog post. However, if your content has more than 
one layer to it, divide your content even further by adding one heading level 
deeper.
	
In Chapter 10, I offer some tips for styling your subheadings with custom 
fonts and colors that complement your overall blog design.

294
Part IV: Creating Design-Friendly Content 
Including Images
A picture is worth a thousand words, 
right? Right! And a picture can also 
enhance a thousand words. Images 
in your blog posts visually break up 
your content and help illustrate or 
support your content as well.
As you can see in Figure 16-3, simply 
adding a couple of photographs 
gives visual spots for a reader’s 
eye to land, easing readability. The 
images keep your eyes moving down 
through a page instead of getting lost 
in big chunks of text.
If you want to know more about 
working images into your blog posts 
and overall blog design, I devote 
Chapter 15 entirely to images.
Depending on the topics you write about, images in your blog posts can 
also take the form of charts, graphs, or infographics. You can create charts 
and infographics using programs like Microsoft Excel or Adobe Illustrator. 
Or if simpler programs are more to your liking, check programs like Google 
Chart Tools (https://developers.google.com/chart) and Piktochart 
(http://piktochart.com) for creating infographics.
Applying Indentation and Block Quotes
Another way to apply design elements to your blog posts and break up long 
blocks of text is to use indentation and block quotes. Both indentation and 
block quotes can add visual appeal to your content by adding contrast to 
that particular block of content. However, they each have a distinct use:
	
✓	If your blog post includes a quote that’s important to the content of your 
blog post, use a block quote.
	
✓	If your blog post includes text you want to set off from the body text, 
such as an important point or example, use the indent feature.
To see the difference between indentation and block quotes, look at Figure 16-4, 
which shows how the WordPress Twenty Eleven theme displays them both. 
The text in italics is a block quote, and the second section uses indentation.
Figure 16-3: Use images in your blog posts to 
keep a reader’s interest.

295
 Chapter 16: Incorporating Design into Your Blog Posts
Figure 16-4: Block quote and indentation examples.
Indentation and quotes work well to highlight content containing a definition, 
quote, testimonial, or any other text that you feel warrants emphasis.
To indent text within a blog post or page on WordPress, click the Indent 
button from within your Visual Editor (see Figure 16-5).
To turn text into a block quote within WordPress, click the Quote button 
from within your Visual Editor (see Figure 16-5).

296
Part IV: Creating Design-Friendly Content 
Including Lists
Just as subheadings can visually organize content within your blog post, so 
can using lists within your blog posts. You can provide focus to listed con­
tent by making it visually stand out from the other blocks of text within your 
post or page.
Within your content, you can display lists that are either bulleted or num­
bered. In Figure 16-6, take a look at the buttons used to change your text into 
either list option.
Bulleted List
Numbered List
Figure 16-6: Bulleted and numbered list icons within the WordPress Visual Editor.
Sometimes it’s okay to include a short list as part of a regular sentence, but dis­
playing content as a list gains more attention when it’s visually different from 
the rest of the content. You might use a list for the following:
	
✓	Supplies needed for a project
	
✓	A checklist of things to do or 
accomplish
	
✓	Must-haves for a particular topic 
(fashion accessories, WordPress 
plug-ins, photography equip­
ment, and so on)
	
✓	Wish lists
	
Lists don’t just have to be used for 
items that fit on just one line. You 
can also use paragraphs within a 
list format. Consider adding more 
visual interest to a list like this by 
using bold or italics, like I did in 
Figure 16-7.
Figure 16-7: Use lists to organize longer areas 
of text.

297
 Chapter 16: Incorporating Design into Your Blog Posts
Increasing Space between Paragraphs
When a blog post or page has long blocks of text, the amount of space 
between paragraphs can almost get lost, adding to what looks like a never-
ending paragraph.
Most blog themes are designed to having an adequate amount of space 
between paragraphs. However, if you begin to customize your blog design by 
changing fonts, you might need to increase this spacing.
To change the spacing between paragraphs, you have to modify your CSS. 
(Read more about CSS in Chapter 9.) Typically, you can search for a piece 
of code in your style.css file that starts with p (for paragraph) and then 
adjust margin-bottom. In the WordPress Twenty Eleven theme, it looks 
like this:
p {
    margin-bottom: 1.625em;
}
Adjust the spacing by increasing the em size to make a noticeable space 
between your paragraphs. In Figure 16-8, notice how the text on the left 
becomes more spaced out after I increased the spacing between paragraphs, 
as shown on the right. (I explain em sizing in Chapter 9, in the section about 
adjusting font size properties.)
	
If you can’t find this bit of code, your theme may display it differently. Use 
Firebug to find the code you need to modify. I give you the run-down on 
Firebug in Chapter 9.
Figure 16-8: Paragraphs are much easier to read with adequate space between them.

our blog design doesn’t just exist on your blog. You probably have a 
presence on at least one social media channel, and you may have even 
ventured elsewhere into activities such as e-books or speaking engagements.
As I mention in Chapter 1, part of building a brand is consistency. Infusing your 
blog design into other areas of your blogging life connects those things with 
your blog, building a consistent look across a variety of platforms and mediums.
This chapter offers ten places where you can work in your blog design. From 
social media to actual printed media, you have many opportunities to show­
case that great design of yours!
	
When working on ideas from this chapter, don’t forget to pull out your blog’s 
style guide that I show you how to create in Chapter 4.
Facebook Page
As a blogger, having a great blog design and great content doesn’t automati­
cally equate to a huge audience. However, being active in at least one social 

302
Part V: The Part of Tens 
media channel can help bring traffic to your blog and build a community of 
readers. Many bloggers start with a Facebook business or community page 
because Facebook is the largest social media network. Luckily, Facebook 
offers plenty of ways to brand your blog’s Facebook page so that it matches 
your blog design.
The two main areas of your Facebook page are the large cover photo and the 
profile picture. Cover photos give you a chance to show imagery that repre­
sents your blog, and a profile picture works best as your blog logo or picture 
of you.
	
A smaller version of your profile photo displays when you publish a post or 
comment.
In Figure 17-1, you can see how Cheryl from Tidy Mom (http://tidymom.
net) uses a Facebook cover photo to highlight an image of her and a little 
about her blog. The profile picture shows the red Tidy Mom logo that people 
associate with the blog.

Figure 17-1: Choose a Facebook cover photo image that represents you or your blog.
	
Facebook has just one guideline when it comes to cover photos: Cover 
photos can’t contain more than 20 percent text over the entire image. 
However, they can include the following:

303
 Chapter 17: Ten Places to Extend Your Blog’s Design
	
✓	Price or purchase information
	
✓	Contact information, such as a blog address
	
✓	References to Facebook features or actions, such a Like or Share
	
✓	Calls to action, such as “Buy now” or “Get this offer”
In addition to cover photos and profile pictures, you can also brand your 
Facebook page using custom tab images. These images direct your Facebook 
page visitors to special apps or tabs, such as an e-mail subscription page or 
an Instagram page within Facebook. In Figure 17-1, you can see that the Tidy 
Mom fan page has one image that leads to a way to get a free gift and another 
image that leads to a giveaway page. You can even customize the text under 
the image.
The Photos tab can’t be moved or modified.
To prepare these images, you can use any of the photo-editing programs that 
I mention in Chapter 15. Here are the following dimensions (in pixels) you’ll 
want to use:
	
✓	Cover photo: 851 x 315 px
	
✓	Profile picture: 160 x 160 px
	
	The photo must be uploaded at a slightly higher size, though — 180 x 180 px.
	
✓	Custom tab images: 111 x 74 px with a maximum file size of 5MB
Twitter
Twitter (https://twitter.com) is a social media microblogging platform 
where users share information in 140 characters or less. Followers (or poten­
tial followers) may visit your Twitter profile to learn more about you, so your 
profile should make a good first impression. Create a Twitter profile that 
reflects your blog’s style and personality.
In Figure 17-2, you can see how Andy and Charlie from How to Be a Dad 
(@HowToBeADad) pull in elements from their blog design while adding a 
personal touch by showing themselves as well.

Figure 17-2: Twitter gives you a few places to infuse your blog’s design.
A Twitter profile has three main visual elements: a small profile picture, 
a header image, and a background. Along with these visual elements, you 
can also change the colors of the links shown on your Twitter feed and in 
the sidebar. Here are the dimensions to create a profile picture and header 
image. Then I talk a bit about the background.
	
✓	Profile picture: 81 x 81 px
	
	However, upload a larger image and let Twitter re-size it. This way, your 
picture its best when someone clicks the image to see a larger version. 
Profile pictures can be up to 2MB.
	
✓	Header image: 1252 x 626 px ( Twitter resizes this to 520 x 260 px)
Creating a customized Twitter background can get tricky because what a 
visitor sees on your background depends on their computer or device’s 
screen size. The actual parts of Twitter that show on top of the background 
(the sidebar, header, and Twitter stream) amount to 865 pixels wide, which 
doesn’t change with a computer monitor’s screen size.
So, to reach as many viewers and followers as possible, I recommend going 
with the following. Create your background image with a size of 1920 x 1080 px 
to cover large screen sizes.
Most of your background design should be a graphic, pattern, image, or color, 
leaving text for the left side of your background design, since this is the part 
of a background that nearly everyone can see. On the left, consider a width 
of approximately 66 px your safe zone for placing any key information (like 
text). Those 66 pixels will be unobstructed for anyone with a screen resolu­
tion of 1024 x 768, which amounts to nearly every Twitter user. You could 
even stretch that dimension as far as 194 px wide, but bear in mind that only 

305
 Chapter 17: Ten Places to Extend Your Blog’s Design
82 percent of Twitter users will be able to see the content. For many Twitter 
users, the benefit of having more space for content outweighs the chance 
that someone won’t see the content. 
Google+
Launched in 2011, Google+ (Google “Plus”) is a social network has gained in 
popularity. Some bloggers use Google+ business pages for their blogs, and 
others prefer to use their Google+ personal profile. Make your page or pro­
file instantly recognizable by adding elements of your blog design to your 
Google+ page.
To create graphics for your page or profile, use these dimensions:
	
✓	Cover photo: 2120 x 1192 px (part of this image runs behind the profile 
picture)
	
✓	Profile picture: 250 x 250 px
	
Google adds a black gradient to the bottom of the cover photo image, dis­
playing the page name, page URL, and number of +1s (or people in your cir­
cles on a personal profile). This area is about 160 pixels tall, so don’t put text 
in the bottom 160 pixels of your cover photo.
Pinterest
Pinterest (http://pinterest.com) is a popular social media platform that 
works like an online pinboard, giving you a place to pin images of recipes, 
crafts, and more. Pinterest can drive mega traffic to many types of blogs, 
from food blogs to fashion blogs.
Because Pinterest focuses heavily on images, some bloggers create a Pinterest-
friendly image for their blog posts. A Pinterest-friendly image typically includes 
a title and a graphic like you see in Figure 17-3. From Away (www.fromaway.
com) sometimes labels a recipe image, using a font from its blog design and a 
clean look that doesn’t distract from the amazing recipe photos.
	
Pinnable images may start to look repetitive if you use the same image for 
every blog post you link to on Pinterest. For Pinterest images, play with your 
design while still honoring your overall blog design. Consider designing a few 
templates and base them off part of your blog design. Don’t be afraid to go 
outside your color scheme and use colors that complement your design.

E-books
Depending on your content, you might end up venturing into creating an 
e-book, which is simply an electronic book that might be in an e-pub format 
(an electronic publication format that can be read on devices like tablets and 
smart phones), a Kindle format, or PDF (or even all three). 
After downloading your e-book, though, that visitor no longer needs to visit 
your blog to retrieve it. In fact, if you sell your e-book on another site (such 
as Amazon), your e-book reader may never even have to visit your blog at all. 
For this reason, designing your e-book (at the very least, your e-book cover) 
gives you a change to introduce readers to your blog design so you can 
connect the e-book with your blog.

If you sell your e-book in an e-pub and a Kindle format, you won’t have as 
many opportunities to incorporate design into the actual body text of your 
book. That means you must really make your cover count!
Printables
Printables have become popular in many circles of blogging. A printable is 
typically a PDF that readers can download and print. The PDF content can 
be anything from a checklist to a craft template to a calendar. Bloggers who 
create printables typically create them rather frequently as a great way to 
drive traffic to a blog.
Designing a printable to complement your blog design increases your blog’s 
brand recognition. Including your blog’s name and design in the printable 
also helps if someone forgets from whose blog they actually got the printable.
Rachel from In Spaces Between (www.inspacesbetween.com) offers a free 
daily planner that keeps the same look and feel as her blog design. The result 
is a printable that reinforces her blog’s recognition for anyone who may 
download the printable (shown in Figure 17-5).

Media Kit
Bloggers who sell advertising on their blog or want to work with brands often 
create a media kit to give to potential partners. A blogging media kit should 
be around one to three pages and consist of available opportunities, blog sta­
tistics, and rates. You might hand out a media kit to a potential partner at a 
blog conference or e-mail a PDF version to a potential advertiser.
Your media kit should be specific to your blog’s design so that a potential 
advertiser or partners have that association to your blog in their mind. Plus, 
matching your media kit to your blog design looks polished and professional 
versus just having a plain document with text and some links. After all, this is 
your chance to impress potential advertisers or partners!
Blog Badges
Some bloggers create badges for their blogs so that other bloggers or websites 
can display the badge on their site and link back to your blog. Think of a badge 
like a little advertisement for your blog. Your blog badge might be displayed on 
a fellow blogger’s sidebar to show adoration for your blog. You might even use 
the badge for an ad or at the end of a guest post or contributor post on another 
website.

309
 Chapter 17: Ten Places to Extend Your Blog’s Design
Because a blog badge represents your blog, the badge’s design should take 
all its design cues from your overall blog design. Badges are typically 125 x 
125 px or slightly larger at 150 x 150 px. You don’t have much space to work 
with, so don’t try to cram too much of your design into the badge design. 
Instead, stick with your blog name, your colors, and maybe a design element 
of some sort.
In Figure 17-6, you can see the blog badge from No Meat Athlete (www.no
meatathlete.com) keeps the font size large and easy to read while tying 
into the overall blog design.

Figure 17-6: A blog badge should be a small representation of your blog design.
Blog Business Cards
While branding social platforms like your Facebook page may seem obvious, 
extending your blog design into something that’s actual paper may not seem 
as obvious.
If you attend a conference or other networking event and plan to represent 
your blog, though, most people expect to exchange blog business cards with 
you. Use a photo-editing or desktop publishing program to create a custom 
design to match your blog. As an alternative, if you use a print company’s 
standard business card template, ensure you can customize at least a few 
pieces of the card. For example, use your blog’s main color or add a visual 
element from your blog’s design to the template.

Slides for Videos and Presentations
As a blogger, you might record a video for anything from a product review to 
an online tutorial. If you get into speaking or online training, you might need 
to create a presentation. With videos and presentations, creating slides that 
mimic your blog design can get readers familiar with your blog design before 
they even visit your blog. Infusing your blog design into videos and presenta­
tions is especially important if you publish videos and presentations online 
but away from your blog, like YouTube for videos and SlideShare (www.
slideshare.net) for presentations.
For videos, you can create a title slide and even slides that divide a longer 
video into sections. Pull colors, fonts, and recognizable design elements into 
your slides.
For presentations, you can create a design in a photo-editing program and then 
add images to your master slides in a program like Microsoft PowerPoint. The 
dimensions for these slides depend on your computer screen resolution and 
version of PowerPoint.
I’ve spoken at a few conferences and match my presentation design to my 
blog design (see Figure 17-7). In doing this, those who may have seen my blog 
in the past can make a connection to me.

Ten Well-Designed Blogs
I

n the span of writing this book, I looked at literally hundreds of blog 
designs. And I came across many blogs that cover a range of styles, from 
subtle elegance to vivid bursts of color. This list isn’t meant to be a “top 10” 
but rather a peek at some great-looking blogs. Each blog in this list stays true 
to a consistent design, complete with little design details that give each of 
these blogs that extra wow factor.
Joy the Baker
If you love food, then prepare to get hungry when you visit Joy the Baker 
(http://joythebaker.com). While the majority of Joy Wilson’s blog fea­
tures baked goodness, she also shares fantastic recipes from smoothies to 
müesli.
The Joy the Baker blog shows you an example of a successful monochromatic 
blog design. As you can see in Figure 18-1, her blog design features various 
shades of pink, from pale pinks to pinks that border on purple. The design 
uses familiar shapes like circles, triangles, lines, and hearts as beautiful 
design elements throughout the blog. In the sidebar, I love how the triangles 
serve as arrows to guide the reader through the sidebar.
Under the Explore section, large images of recent recipes entice visitors. 
When you run your mouse over one, the image fades, and the post title 
appears.

Go See Write
Go See Write (www.goseewrite.com) is a travel blog written by Michael 
Hodson. In December 2008, he set off on a trek across the world. Sixteen 
months later, he succeeded . . . and then kept traveling. Michael’s travels 
have taken him from Ethiopia to Colombia.
Michael’s header features a font and illustrations reminiscent of an art deco 
style (see Figure 18-2). The bold, red circle and blog name in the center of 
the gives the header a symmetrical look, with modes of transportation and 
famous landmarks to balance each side. Having a navigation menu within the 
header graphic adds a nice twist on the typical menu bar. In addition, the 
large rotating photo gallery moves your attention downward; below the gal­
lery, you see excerpts of his latest blog posts.
Underneath a handful of blog post excerpts, you find five columns of even 
more content with a category label at the top. The change from the previous 
excerpts makes these stand out and provides a nice timeline of recent travels.

Nom Nom Paleo
Nom Nom Paleo (http://nomnompaleo.com) is a popular blog in the world 
of paleo cooking. Blogger Michelle Tam grew up loving food, majored in 
Nutrition & Food Science at Berkeley, and later earned a doctorate in clinical 
pharmacy. After first laughing off the paleo(lithic) diet her husband was on, 
she began seeing his results and decided to go paleo herself in 2010. About 
six months later, she started her blog and is now considered an expert in all 
things paleo.
Michelle’s blog (see Figure 18-3) forgoes a header at the top of the blog 
design, instead prominently featuring a logo at the top of the sidebar. The 
cartoon image of herself appears throughout her blog, adding a recognizable 
and repetitive element to the design.

Figure 18-3: A distinct logo at the sidebar top replaces the need for a 
blog header.
A blog design goes from great to wow when you add little surprises into your 
design like Michelle does (see Figure 18-4). When a visitor runs their mouse 
over certain design elements on the blog, her cartoon self changes expres­
sions. So clever!
Nom Nom Paleo even has an iPhone app that mimics the look of her blog and 
exudes as much personality as the blog design does.

Say Yes to Hoboken
On the blog Say Yes to Hoboken (http://sayyestohoboken.com), Liz 
Stanley and her team of contributors share tutorials, style ideas, and recipes 
that make you want to try doing everything. The blog’s tagline states “three 
cheers for stylish & crafty living,” and the blog design indeed brings that 
statement to life.
The header is clean and simple, using bright, cheerful colors to tie into the 
mission of the blog (see Figure 18-5). The design uses a few different colors 
but avoids being overwhelming by serving up plenty of white space.
Main navigation in the sidebar

Figure 18-5: A cheery design perfectly complements this blog’s content.
One reason why I love this blog’s design is because it proves you don’t always 
have to place the navigation menu at the top to be effective. The main points of 
navigation are contained within the top of the sidebar. Further down the side­
bar, four labels call attention to the blog’s main categories, and bright yellow 
buttons highlight some common menu items many readers expect to see. 
Below those buttons, four images call out the blog’s featured tutorials.

Alex Beadon
Alex Beadon’s blog (www.alexbeadonphotography.com) began as a blog 
for photography but has morphed into a blog that helps small business 
owners build a successful business and “live life like a boss.”
Alex’s blog design commands your attention with its vivid colors and impact­
ful font, as shown in Figure 18-6. Each blog post features an eye-popping 
image with large graphical elements and a picture of Alex.
	
When you’re someone building a brand with your name, frequently using an 
image of yourself helps reinforce that connection to you.

Figure 18-6: Vivid colors add a creative twist to the blog header image.
On the sidebar, each main category is elegantly highlighted using a simple 
bar at the top, image underneath, with an action statement overlaid on the 
picture (refer to Figure 18-6). Using the same design treatment on each cat­
egory helps the reader understand that these are all topics she blogs about. 
Underneath these, an e-mail subscription area uses a complementary yet dif­
ferent look to distinguish it from the others.

Los Angeles, I’m Yours
Los Angeles, I’m Yours (www.laimyours.com) focuses on the art, design, life­
style, and culture in the city of Los Angeles as well as showcasing the people 
who bring artistic passion to a thriving metropolis. Run by Bobby Soloman and 
Kyle Fitzpatrick, the blog is “a love letter to the city, from the city.”
As you can see from its homepage (shown on the left in Figure 18-7), this 
blog features a minimal design with a vast amount of white space, allowing 
images to take the spotlight. The design features a large main image of the 
most recent post with two right sidebars of different widths. The sidebar 
on the far right highlights a Contact page, a fun LA Drink Map, and a list of 
categories. That sidebar’s content is ideal for the narrow width, saving space 
for the main sidebar featuring Newsbites that lead to other sites featuring 
LA-focused content.
When you click a blog post, you’re lead to a page, like that shown on the right 
in Figure 18-7. The first sidebar vanishes to make way for a large main image 
that sweeps across most of the page, making a big impact. Underneath the 
image, the space splits into the actual blog post and a conveniently located 
space to encourage interaction such as leaving a comment, sharing the post, 
or reading similar posts.

Rage Against the Minivan
A professor of psychology, Kristen Howerton started her blog (www.rage
againsttheminivan.com) back in 2006 as a coping skill for becoming a 
mom to four children within four years through birth and adoption. Not only 
is the blog name Rage Against the Minivan just brilliant, so is the blog design 
(see Figure 18-8).
Kristen’s blog features earthy colors, while pops of blue from her family pic­
tures draws your eyes to the header and individual family shots in the side­
bar. With a subtle linen texture in the background, the green from her blog 
header and blue from her header image stand out even more.
© Kristen Howerton, Author – www.rageagainsttheminivan.com
Figure 18-8: Colors stand out because of contrast.
Torn paper strips, crinkled paper, tape, staples, and safety pins all make this 
blog feel handmade and welcoming. These embellishments are used through­
out the blog, making the blog design consistent no matter which area you’re 
viewing. You can also see how a hierarchy exists with some of these design 
elements. For example, the green pieces of paper all use safety pins and are 
reserved for the header and sidebar headings, while the staples are reserved 
for the top categories in the sidebar.

What I Wore
Jessica Quirk started posting photos of her daily outfits online in 2007 while 
she was working in Manhattan and Hong Kong. Those posts grew into the 
2008 launch of What I Wore (http://whatiwore.tumblr.com) and is now 
her full-time business.
Jessica’s overall blog design, shown on the left in Figure 18-9, features a 
clean layout with gray design elements. Her blog design mixes a bold all caps 
font with a simple serif font. The neutral-colored layout places the focus on 
photos of her daily outfits or photos illustrating other topics like exercise 
routines. Her outfit photos provide vivid colors that contrast nicely with the 
neutral background.
© Jessica Quirk, What I Wore
Figure 18-9: Using gray design elements make Jessica’s daily outfit photos pack even more of a punch.
For each daily outfit post, Jessica features a few photos of her wearing 
the outfit and then one photo features a circle design element, a transpar­
ent strip, and a tip like you see on the right in Figure 18-9. The consistency 
lets readers know that they can expect a quick tip in each daily outfit post. 
Clicking Read More from the homepage takes you to even more details about 
the outfit.
	
What I Wore features great, user-friendly ways to find the daily outfits. Check 
out Chapter 12 to see how Jessica’s blog lets you find an outfit by color, 
recent outfits, and more.

Butter
Butter (http://mombutter.typepad.com) is a blog by Jan Livingston 
Mokhtari that focuses on “rich bites of inspiration” from food to music to style. 
Jan, a mom living in Los Angeles who grew up in the Midwest, is a creative 
director for an ad agency and runs a production company with her husband.
Her blog design caught my eye with the bright yellow word Butter against 
a gray background. The yellow fits with the blog name Butter and pops 
throughout the design as section headings and lines like you see under each 
blog post title (see Figure 18-10).
Hand-drawn category buttons

Figure 18-10: Pops of yellow make this blog cheery and uplifting.
One of the most endearing qualities about this blog are the hand-drawn but­
tons for her blog categories. Jan actually drew them herself with a permanent 
marker and watercolors. I just love how each button complements the others 
yet remains unique to the topic it represents.
The Everywhereist
The Everywhereist (www.everywhereist.com) is a travel blog infused with 
a healthy dose of humor. Geraldine DeRuiter started the blog in 2009 after 

321
 Chapter 18: Ten Well-Designed Blogs
she was laid off. Instead of finding another job, she decided to travel the 
world with her husband who was already traveling extensively for work. On 
the blog, Geraldine explains that at its core, the blog is a love letter to her 
husband so he can remember the places they visit, even when he’s some­
times stuck inside giving presentations or attending meetings.
When you first arrive on The Everywhereist, the header design draws you 
in right away with the red blog name and dark gray travel landmarks (see 
Figure 18-11). The blog design manages to make it clear that this blog is 
about traveling but without being cliché in its design.
In this blog’s design, one of the best aspects is the subtlety of the design ele­
ments. The gridded background in the header reminds me of a map, and the 
icon above the “I” in the blog name is a symbolic reference a pin on a map. 
Stamp borders outline the navigation menu tabs in the header and the e-mail 
list field in the footer.
The blog also places valuable links and information directly underneath 
the header instead of the sidebar. The contrast between the script font and 
all caps font add visual interest, and the linked images turn blue when you 
mouse over them.

About the Author
Melissa Culbertson is a marketing communications professional with over 12 
years of experience doing everything from writing content and designing mar­
keting materials to overseeing web projects and managing social media. She’s 
worked in various industries and on projects ranging from website redesigns 
to new product launches. 
In 2009, Melissa stepped into the blogging world, writing at her personal blog 
Adventuroo (www.adventuroo.com). The deeper she got into blogging, the 
more she realized that bloggers craved knowledge to improve their blogs. 
She had a light-bulb-flashing moment: Her marketing communications knowl­
edge applies to blogging, too.
Less than two years after hitting Publish on her first blog post, she started 
Momcomm (www.momcomm.com), where she offers tips on blogging and social 
media and teaches online blogging courses. On Momcomm, she’s critiqued 
over 100 blogs, offering tips to improve a blogger’s design, navigation, and 
content. Melissa has also spoken at blogger conferences on everything from 
blog design to increasing reader engagement.
Melissa lives in Raleigh, North Carolina, in a house overrun with boys — 
her husband, two sons, and the family Labrador Trajan.
Dedication
This book is dedicated to my wonderful husband Daniel, whose support for 
the work I do never wavers. This book is also for my two boys, Noah and 
Ethan, who will think it’s cool to see my name on the cover and their names 
in print. I love you all.
Author’s Acknowledgments
I’ve been a For Dummies book fan since the early 2000s, when I purchased 
Marketing For Dummies. I already had a young career in marketing but didn’t 
want to miss out on something I was supposed to already know. I also credit 
Puppy Training For Dummies as the sole reason my dog is so well-behaved. 
I’m honored (and a more than a little giddy) to have my name on the front of 
one. Thanks to Wiley for giving me this opportunity.
I’d like to thank Amy Fandrei, Becky Huehls, Teresa Artman, and Susie Gardner 
from the For Dummies team for answering my many questions, providing 
direction, and working so incredibly hard behind the scenes to make sure 
this book rocks. You ladies have talent!

I’d also like to give props to Andrea Updyke, Brittany Van der Linden, Erin 
Lane, Fadra Nally, Melanie Nelson, and Heather Rook for being both sounding 
boards and question takers as I went through the book writing process. 
To my family and close friends, thanks for sharing this journey with me (and 
sorry if I forgot to call you back). I’d like to thank Mom and Dad for always 
encouraging me to write, whether it was a short story in grade school or an 
article for the local paper in high school. Thanks also to my sisters Christy 
and Jennifer for all those childhood coloring sessions. I’m sure they had 
something to do with the creative spark we each have inside us. 
Finally, I’d like to thank all those colleagues I’ve worked with in the past who 
taught, mentored, and challenged me throughout my marketing career. I’d 
like to give huge thanks my blog readers — your desire to learn and your 
blogging successes inspire me. Thanks also to the bloggers who allowed me 
to feature them in this book — the book wouldn’t be the same without your 
blogs as examples of great design.
