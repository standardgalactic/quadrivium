Improving Threat Modeling

“Tell me and I forget.
Teach me and I remember.
Involve me and I learn.”
Benjamin Franklin

Module Objectives
 Learn about common pitfalls
- Security and support issues
- Quality and quantity issues
- Generic issues
 Course summary

Security and Support

 Documentation and diagrams are sensitive
- Make sure they’re properly protected

 Support and adoption can be tricky
- Focus threat modeling around people 
that will participate
- Leverage existing processes
- Invite more stakeholders than ’just’ 
compliance and security
- Executive support is important
- Generate metrics
- Encourage discussions between teams

Quality and Quantity

 100% accurate models are impossible
- Model tries to predict behavior
- Any threat model is better than none
- Initial process is more important than 
the outcome
- Remember the goal: reducing risks

 Scope creep can happen
- Set scope and boundaries beforehand
- Document decisions and assumptions
- Start small
- Generalize in the beginning
- During brainstorming, cap time per 
threat

Generic Issues with Threat Modeling

 Follow up, treat vulnerabilities as bugs
- Not everything needs to be fixed
 Re-use existing documentation and lists
 Tools can be a constraint
 It is a process: Treat it like one
 Keep it as simple as possible
- More people might try it

 Threat modeling helps reducing risk
 Don’t underestimate threat modeling…
 …but don’t overestimate it either
 See what works for your organization
 Embed it as recurring process
 Practice makes perfect
