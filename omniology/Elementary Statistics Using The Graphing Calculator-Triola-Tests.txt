SHORT ANSWER.  Write the word or phrase that best completes each statement or answers the question.
1) A population is the complete collection of all elements. A sample is a subset of elements drawn from a
population. A parameter is a numerical measurement describing some characteristic of a population. A
statistic is a numerical measurement describing some characteristic of a sample. A census is the
collection of data from every element in a population; a sample is a subset of a population.

6) Sample: the 50,000 selected college students; population: all college students; representative
7) Desk job workers are confined to their chairs for most of their work day. Other jobs require standing or
walking around which burns calories. It is probably the lack of exercise that causes higher weights, not
the desk job itself. Avoid causality altogether by saying lack of walking and exercise is associated with
higher weights.
8) This is not a random sample. The survey is based on voluntary, self-selected responses and therefore
has serious potential for bias.
9) The question is loaded. A more neutral way to phrase the question would be, for example, "Do you
believe that gun control laws should be strengthened, weakened, or left in their current form?".

SHORT ANSWER.  Write the word or phrase that best completes each statement or answers the question.
17) In random sampling, each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected. Random
sampling provides us with the best representative sample in which all groups of the population are
approximately proportionately represented. Careless sampling can easily result in a biased sample
which may be useless.
18) Sampling error is the difference between a sample result and the true population result. Such an error
results from chance sample fluctuations. A nonsampling error occurs when the sample data are
incorrectly collected, recorded, or analyzed. Examples include nonrandom samples, defective
measuring instruments, biased survey questions, a large number of refusals, copying sample data
incorrectly.
19) This is systematic sampling. The sample obtained will be a random sample because everyone has the
same chance of being chosen but will not be a simple random sample as different samples of 50 people
have different chances of being chosen.  Specifically, the sample is random because each person has one
chance in twenty of being selected.  The sample is not simple random because different samples of size
50  by this design have different chances of being selected due to the numbers of people arriving at the
store at different times.

9) Answers will vary. Possible answer: This is a misleading use of percentages, as 20% of the reduced
workforce is smaller than 20% of the original workforce. The company therefore did not hire as many
new workers as it originally laid off. The size of the current workforce is therefore smaller than the size
of the workforce before the layoffs.

17) A double blind experiment is one in which neither the subjects nor the researchers know who is getting
the treatment. Blinding is when the subject does not know whether he or she is receiving a treatment or
a placebo. Blinding is used to counteract the placebo effect in which an untreated subject believes he or
she is receiving a treatment and reports an improvement in symptoms due to this belief.
18) In an observational study, we observe and measure specific characteristics, but we don't attempt to
manipulate or modify the subjects being studied. In an experiment we apply some treatment and then
proceed to observe its effects on the subjects. In the experiment, the group receiving the treatment is
called the treatment group. The control group is the group that is not given the treatment.
19) This is cluster sampling.  The sample obtained will  not be  a simple random sample of all high school
teachers in the district because different samples have different chances of being selected due to varying
numbers of teachers in different schools.
20) Confounding occurs in an experiment when the effects of two or more variables cannot be distinguished

1) For the given data,  the class width is 9, since that value is the range, 73 - 28, divided by the number of
classes.  However, the quotient should always be rounded up, even when a whole number results.  If 9
were mistakenly used as the class width, the last datum, which is 73, would be cut off the distribution
because the upper limit of the fifth class is 72.  More data would be cut off, if the class start was below
28.
2) Answers will vary.

1) Answers will vary depending on examples given.  However, since 150 is six times 25, relative
frequencies adjust for the extreme difference in sample sizes.
2) Since the standard deviation measures average spread from the mean, the first data set, which shows no
variation, has the smallest standard deviation, zero.  The last data set would have the most variation
because the mean is not in the set, and the values are more spread out from 30 in comparison to the
middle data set where four values equal 30.

SHORT ANSWER.  Write the word or phrase that best completes each statement or answers the question.
1) Probabilities compare the number of occurrences of an event A to the total number of outcomes. Odds
compare the number of occurrences of event A to the number of occurrences of the complement of event
A. If the odds for A are 13:6, then P(A) = 13
19  since there would be a total of 19 outcomes (13 + 6).
2) The two reasons include the lower chance of getting only good items when some defects are present,
and sampling with replacement might allow you to test the same item more than once which would be
inefficient. You should use the multiplication rule for dependent events, since the sample space has
diminished and the probability of choosing a second good item has gotten smaller.
3) P(at least one correct) = 1 - P(none are correct). The alternative to the complement method is to find
P(1), P(2),...P(15) and take this sum. This method is too time consuming and too difficult.

SHORT ANSWER.  Write the word or phrase that best completes each statement or answers the question.
1) For problem (a), the probability is 0.8204.  For problem (b), the probability is 0.1007.  The diagram for (a)
shows the union of areas on both sides of the mean; the diagram for (b) shows an area to the right of the
mean.  Both problems can be solved by the same procedure:  find the equivalent z score and associated
area, i.e., probability, for each x value; subtract the smaller area from the larger area.  Table A-2
facilitates this common procedure because it provides cumulative areas from the left for both negative
and positive z scores.
2) Problem (a) can be solved by the Central Limit theorem.  Even though the parent population is not
normal, samples of size 50 are large.  Their distribution will be normal.  The probability is 0.0001.
Problem (b) cannot be solved by the Central Limit theorem, because the sample size is smaller than 30
and the parent population is not normal.  Their distribution will not be normal.

show that the area, i.e., probability,  for (a) begins to the left of the mean and extends to positive infinity;
for (b) the area begins to the right of the mean and extends to positive infinity.  The procedure is the
same, which is: find the equivalent z score for the given x value, then find the area associated with that z
score, and subtract that area from 1.0000.  Table A-2 facilitates this common procedure because it

SHORT ANSWER.  Write the word or phrase that best completes each statement or answers the question.
1) The margin of error is the maximum likely difference between the observed sample mean x and the true
value for the population mean m. The confidence interval is found by taking the sample mean x and
adding the margin of error E to find the high value and subtracting E to find the low value of the
interval. In the interval 9.65 < m < 11.35, the sample mean x is 10.5 and the error estimate E is 0.85.
2) As shown in the formula, the appropriate sample size is dependent on the appropriate z score, the
sample proportion, and the margin of error, not on N, the population size.
3) Use a result from a prior study or use p^ = 0.5.

SHORT ANSWER.  Write the word or phrase that best completes each statement or answers the question.
1) Use the normal (z) distribution if the population SD is known and the population is normally
distributed or if the population SD is known and the sample size exceeds 30.  Use the t distribution if the
population SD is unknown and the population is normally distributed or if the population SD is
unknown and the sample size exceeds 30.
2) We are 95% sure that the interval 24.8 < m < 29.6 minutes contains the true mean. But it is incorrect to
say m has a 95% chance of falling within the specific limits of 24.8 and 29.6 minutes. Therefore, it would
not be advisable to advertise room service in under 30 minutes.
3) Answers will vary, but for example: Suppose we have a confidence interval of 0.456 < m < 0.462 for the
mean diameter of washers being being machined by the night shift of a plant. If the mean diameter is
supposed to be 0.470, we can conclude that the process needs to be adjusted.
4)
s2  is unbiased, neither overestimating nor underestimating s2 , and s2  values are more consistent,
having less variation about s2 .

1) The value for the test statistic F will be 1 or greater. If the value is reasonably close to 1, the conclusion is
that the two variances are equal. If the value is significantly greater than 1, the conclusion is that the two
variances are not equal.
2) When the samples are independent, the differences between the sample means, x1 - x2 is computed.
The process proceeds exactly like the process in Chapter 7 for testing hypotheses  about one mean with

SHORT ANSWER.  Write the word or phrase that best completes each statement or answers the question.
1) It tells us the correlation is significant and it would be appropriate to use the linear regression equation
for prediction (for appropriate values of the dependent variable).
2) The standard error of estimate, se, is a measure of the distances between the observed sample y values
and the predicted values y^. Smaller values of se indicate that the actual values of y will be closer to the
regression line, whereas larger values of se indicate a greater dispersion of the y values from the
regression line. When the standard error of estimate is 0, the y values lie on the regression line.

1) The symbol r represents the population correlation as opposed to the sample correlation r. The null
hypothesis means that the population correlation is 0; that is, there is no significant linear correlation
between the two variables. The alternative hypothesis states that there is significant linear correlation.
2) The linear regression equation should be used only if the correlation is significant. Provided the
correlation is significant, the linear regression equation should be used only when the predicting value x
is within the scope of the data used to create the equation.
3) The independent variable is x, representing values we will use for the prediction; the dependent
variable is y, representing values we want to predict based on the values of the independent variable.

SHORT ANSWER.  Write the word or phrase that best completes each statement or answers the question.
1) The test of homogeneity tests the claim that different populations have the same proportions of some
characteristics. In the test of homogeneity, there are predetermined totals for either the rows or columns
of the contingency table. In the test of independence, there is one big sample drawn so that the row and
column totals are determined randomly. In the test of homogeneity, predetermined sample sizes are
used for each population.
2) Categorical data are data that can be separated into different nonnumeric categories. Examples will
vary.
3) H0: The proportions of absences are all the same, p = .20.
H1: The proportions of absences are not all the same.
Test statistic: c2 = 28.308. Critical value: c2 = 9.488. Reject the null hypothesis. There is sufficient
evidence to warrant rejection of the claim that absences occur on the different week days with the same
frequency.
4) H0: The proportions of responses are all equal, p = .20.
H1: The proportions of responses are not all equal.
Test statistic: c2 = 1.875. Critical value: c2 = 9.488. Fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is not
sufficient evidence to warrant rejection of the claim that the responses occur with the same frequency.
5) H0: The responses occur according to the stated percentages.
H1: The responses do not occur according to the stated percentages.
Test statistic: c2 = 5.146. Critical value: c2 = 9.488. Fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is not
sufficient evidence to warrant rejection of the claim that the responses occur according to the stated
percentages.

claimed value.  The value of the test statistic is c2 = 0.72, which is less than the critical value of
c2 = 5.991.  We fail to reject the null hypothesis.
7) H0: Treatment and reaction are independent.
H1: Treatment and reaction are dependent.
Test statistic: c2 = 1.798. Critical value: c2 = 3.841.
Fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is not sufficient evidence to warrant rejection of the claim that
treatment and reaction are independent.
8) H0: Employment status and response are independent.
H1: Employment status and response are dependent.
Test statistic: c2 = 5.942. Critical value: c2 = 4.605.
Reject the null hypothesis. There is sufficient evidence to warrant rejection of the claim that response
and employment status are independent.
9) H0: The proportion of wins is the same for teams wearing suits as for teams wearing jeans and t-shirts.
H1: The proportions are different.
Test statistic: c2 = 1.440. Critical value: c2 = 3.841.

10) i) H0:  Gender is independent of the health care coverage.
H1:  Gender and health care coverage are dependent.
The value of the test statistic is c2= 0.000346, which is less than the critical value of 3.841.  We fail to
reject the null hypothesis.
ii)  The value of the test statistic is c2= 0.028510, which is still less than the critical value of 3.841.  We
still fail to reject the null hypothesis.  Yates' correction typically decreases the value of the test statistic.
However, due to the close fit of the O and E values in this problem, the Yates' correction increased the
calculated test statistic.

SHORT ANSWER.  Write the word or phrase that best completes each statement or answers the question.
1) A goodness-of-fit test is used to test the hypothesis that an observed frequency distribution fits some
claimed distribution. The assumptions are 1) the sample data are randomly selected and the data consist
of frequency counts for the different categories; and 2) for each of the categories, the expected frequency
is at least 5.
2) The null hypothesis is that the row and column variables in a contingency table are independent; that is,
they are not related. The assumptions are 1) the null hypothesis is that the row and column variables are
independent while the alternate hypothesis is that the row and column variables are dependent; 2) the
sample data are randomly selected; and 3) each cell in the contingency table has an expected frequency
E of at least 5. The major difference is that these assumptions do not require that the parent population
be normally distributed.
3) H0: The proportions of occurrences are all equal, p = 1/6.
H1: Those proportions are not all equal.
Test statistic: c2 = 8.263. Critical value: c2 = 11.071. Fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is not
sufficient evidence to warrant rejection of the claim that the characteristics occur with the same
frequency.
4) H0: The die is fair (all numbers occur with equal frequency).
H1: The die is not fair.
Test statistic: c2 = 24.25. Critical value: c2 = 11.071. Reject the null hypothesis. There is sufficient
evidence to warrant rejection of the claim that the die is fair.
5) H0: Gender and response are independent.
H1: Gender and response are dependent.
Test statistic: c2 = 0.579. Critical value: c2 = 5.991.
Fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is not sufficient evidence to warrant rejection of the claim that
response and gender are independent.
6) H0: Major and response are independent.
H1: Major and response are dependent.
Test statistic: c2 = 6.502. Critical value: c2 = 2.706.
Reject the null hypothesis. There is sufficient evidence to warrant rejection of the claim that response
and major are independent.

SHORT ANSWER.  Write the word or phrase that best completes each statement or answers the question.
1) The O represents the observed frequencies. The E represents the expected frequencies based on the
assumption of independence. The c2 value will be smaller when the difference between observed and
expected frequencies is small and will be larger when the difference between observed and expected
values is large. The c2 value will be significant when there is a significant difference between the
observed and expected values.
2) Suppose A and B are two categories in a contingency table. In probability computations, the P(A and B)
would be computed as P(A)œP(B), provided A and B are independent. The assumption of the null
hypothesis is that A and B are in fact independent, so we use the formula P(A and B) = P(A)œP(B).
Since P(A) = # occurrences A
total occurrences and P(B) = # occurrences B
total occurrences, then
P(A and B) = # occurrences A
total occurrences œ # occurrences B
total occurrences.
Then the expected number of outcomes for A and B would be
P(A and B) œ total occurrences
= # occurrences A
total occurrences œ # occurrences B
total occurrences œ total occurrences.
or P(A and B) œ total occurrences
= # occurrences A œ # occurrences B
total occurrences
This is also the formula for the expected frequency for each cell in a contingency table,
E = # occurrences A œ # occurrences B
total occurrences
.
So the computation of the expected values is based on the assumption of independence. Examples may
be given and will vary.
3) Any drawing such as that shown in Figure 10-1 will suffice. The chi-square distribution is not
symmetric. The values of a chi-square distribution can be 0 or positive, but they cannot be negative. The
chi-square distribution is different for each number of degrees of freedom. Examples will vary.
Possibilities are a 2 x 2 contingency table for one degree of freedom and a goodness-of-fit test of three
categories for two degrees of freedom.
4) H0: The distribution of the sample agrees with the population distribution.
H1: It does not agree.
Test statistic: c2 = 31.938. Critical value: c2 = 7.815. Reject the null hypothesis. There is sufficient
evidence to warrant rejection of the claim that the distribution of the sample agrees with the distribution
of the  state populations.

6) i)  H0:  p0 = p1= . . . = p7= 1/7.  H1:  At least one of these probabilities is different from the others.  The
value of the test statistic is c2 = 2.4, which is less than the critical value of c2 = 12.59.  We fail to reject
the null hypothesis.
ii)  The value of the test statistic is c2 = 579.5, which is greater than the critical value of c2 = 12.59.   We
reject the null hypothesis.  An outlier has a significant effect on the c2 test statistic.
7) H0: Car color and being in an accident are independent.
H1: Car color and being in an accident are dependent.
Test statistic: c2 = 0.4287. Critical value: c2 = 9.210.
Fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is not sufficient evidence to warrant rejection of the claim that
car color and being in an accident are independent.
8) H0: Age and preferred music type are independent.
H1: Age and preferred music type are dependent.
Test statistic: c2 = 12.954. Critical value: c2 = 9.488.
Reject the null hypothesis. There is sufficient evidence to warrant rejection of the claim that age and
preferred music type are independent.
9) H0: The proportion of men who plan to vote in the next election is the same as the proportion of women
who plan to vote.
H1: The proportions are different.
Test statistic: c2 = 1.552. Critical value: c2 = 6.635.
Fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is not sufficient evidence to warrant rejection of the claim that
the proportion of men who plan to vote in the next election is the same as the proportion of women who
plan to vote.
10) H0: The proportion of students smoking is the same at all four colleges.
H1: The proportions are different.
Test statistic: c2 = 17.832. Critical value: c2 = 11.345.
Reject the null hypothesis. There is sufficient evidence to warrant rejection of the claim that the
proportion of students smoking is the same at all four colleges.

ii) Accept the claim that the average temperature is the same in each greenhouse since
F = 0.128 < F0.05(2, 18) = 3.55.
9) H0: There is no interaction effect.
H1: There is an interaction effect.
Test statistic: F = 1.2261. Critical value: F = 2.9277.
Fail to reject the null hypothesis. There does not appear to be an interaction effect.
10) H0: There is no machine effect.
H1: There is a machine effect.
Test statistic: F = 53.7172. Critical value: F = 3.5546.
Reject the null hypothesis. There does appear to be a machine effect.
11) H0: There is no employee effect.
H1: There is an employee effect.
Test statistic: F = 0.3296. Critical value: F = 3.5546.
Fail to reject the null hypothesis. There does not appear to be an employee effect.
12) H0:  There is no driver effect.  H1:  There is a driver effect.  The P-value is 0.729, which is greater than
0.05.  We fail to reject the null hypothesis; it appears that the driver does not affect the racing times.
13) H0:  There is no teacher effect.  H1:  There is a teacher effect.  The P-value is 0.404, which is greater than
0.05.  We fail to reject the null hypothesis; it appears that the teacher does not affect the class average.
14) Since P = 0.3958 for the interaction, you fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is no effect due to the
interaction. Yes, it is appropriate to see if there is a significant effect due to either A or B. The P-value
for B is P = 0.0001, which rejects the null hypothesis that there is no effect due to B. The means for B are
not all the same.

15) H0:  Gender has no effect on income.  H1:  Gender has an effect on income.  The test statistic is
F = 0.155591, and the corresponding P-value is 0.697883.  Because the P-value is greater than 0.05, we
fail to reject the null hypothesis that gender has no effect on income.
16) The ANOVA results are not affected by adding 5 minutes to each completion time.
The null hypothesis of no interaction between machine and gender is not rejected since the P-value is
0.946.  The null hypothesis of no effect from machine is rejected since the P-value is 0.013.  The null
hypothesis of no effect from gender is not rejected since the P-value is 0.382.

SHORT ANSWER.  Write the word or phrase that best completes each statement or answers the question.
1) The six paired hypotheses are mA = mB, mA = mC, mA = mD, mB = mC, mB = mD, mC = mD. Suppose we test
each with a 5% significance level (95% confidence level). Then, the degree of confidence for all six would
be0.956 or 0.735, yielding an excessively high risk of a type I error. ANOVA maintains the 5%
significance level while testing equivalence of all four means.
2) A treatment (also known as a factor) is a property or characteristic that allows us to distinguish the
different populations from one another. Examples will vary.
MULTIPLE CHOICE.  Choose the one alternative that best completes the statement or answers the
question.

4) D
5) C
SHORT ANSWER.  Write the word or phrase that best completes each statement or answers the question.
6) Test statistic: F = 1.620. Critical value: F = 8.0215.
Fail to reject the claim of equal means. The data do not provide sufficient evidence to conclude that
there is a difference in the mean lifetime of the three brands of ballpoint pen.
7) H0 : m1 = m2 = m3 = m4. H1 : The means are not all equal.
Test statistic: F = 0.0555. Critical value: F = 3.9539.
Fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is not sufficient evidence to warrant rejection of the claim that
the four brands have the same mean.
8) i) Reject the claim that the average temperature is the same in each greenhouse since
 F = 24.3 > F0.025(2, 18) = 4.5597.
ii) The analysis of variance results are not affected.
9) H0: There is no employee effect.
H1: There is an employee effect.
Test statistic: F = 0.1898. Critical value: F = 3.5546.
Fail to reject the null hypothesis. There does not appear to be an employee effect.
10) H0: There is no interaction effect.
H1: There is an interaction effect.
Test statistic: F = 0.7062. Critical value: F = 2.9277.
Fail to reject the null hypothesis. There does not appear to be an interaction effect.
11) H0: There is no machine effect.
H1: There is a machine effect.
Test statistic: F = 0.0664. Critical value: F = 3.5546.
Fail to reject the null hypothesis. The type of machine does not appear to have an effect on the number
of items produced.
12) H0:  There is no track effect.  H1:  There is a track effect.  The P-value is 0.00763, which is less than 0.05.
We reject the null hypothesis; it appears that the track does effect the racing times.
13) H0:  There is no effect due to the time of day.  H1:  There is an effect due to the time of day.  The
P-value is 0.3444, which is greater than 0.05.  We fail to reject the null hypothesis; it appears that the
scores are not affected by time of day.
14) Since P = 0.0031 for the interaction, you reject the null hypothesis that there is no effect due to the
interaction. No, it is not appropriate to see if there is a significant effect due to either A or B. Do not
consider the effects of either factor without considering the effects of the other.

15) H0: There is no interaction between gender and level of education.  H1:  There is an interaction between
gender and level of education.  The test statistic is F = 0.177472, and the corresponding P-value is
0.838832.  Because the P-value is greater than 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis of no interaction
between gender and level of education.
16) If the first sample value is changed to 30 minutes, the ANOVA results are changed.  The null hypothesis
of no interaction between machine and gender is still not rejected.  The null hypothesis of no effect from
gender is still not rejected. However, the null hypothesis of no effect from machine is now accepted
instead of rejected.
Before the change, the F test statistic = 9.7222.  After the change, the F statistic = 2.5956.  The F critical
value at (2,6), a = 0.05 is 5.1433.

SHORT ANSWER.  Write the word or phrase that best completes each statement or answers the question.
1) 1) The populations have approximately normal distributions.
2) The populations have the same variance s2 (or standard deviation s).
3) The samples are random and independent of each other.
4) The different samples are from populations that are categorized in only one way. (The requirements
of normality and equal variances are somewhat relaxed.)
2) Variance between samples measures the variation between the sample means of the groups treated
differently, that is the variation due to the treatment. The variance within the samples depends solely on
the sample variances of the groups treated alike. The F ratio compares the two. If the F ratio is relatively
close to 1, the two variances are about the same, and we conclude that there are no significant
differences among the sample means. When the value of F is excessively large (that is, greater than 1),
we conclude that the variation among the samples is not the same and that the means are not equal.

Fail to reject the claim of equal means. The data do not provide sufficient evidence to conclude that
there is a difference in the true mean weight loss produced by the three exercise programs.
6) H0 : m1 = m2 = m3. H1 : The means are not all equal.
Test statistic: F = 12.1230. Critical value: F = 5.0959.
Reject the null hypothesis. There is sufficient evidence to warrant rejection of the claim that the three
brands have the same mean.

SHORT ANSWER.  Write the word or phrase that best completes each statement or answers the question.
8) i) An F test of homogeneity of variance suggests  equal population variances. The F test statistic =
1.3349; the F critical value = 9.6045.  Therefore, the pooled variance model applies.  Since t = 1.315 <
t0.025(8) = 2.306, accept the claim that the two samples come from populations with the same means.
ii) Since F = 1.73 < F0.05(1, 8) = 5.32, accept the claim that the two samples come from populations with
the same means.
iii) t2= 1.3152= 1.73 = F and t0.025(8) 2 = 2.3062= 5.32 = F0.05(1, 8)
9) H0: There is no employee effect.
H1: There is an employee effect.
Test statistic: F = 46.3842. Critical value: F = 3.5546.
Reject the null hypothesis. The employee does appear to have an effect on the number of items
produced.
10) H0: There is no machine effect.
H1: There is a machine effect.
Test statistic: F = 3.1857. Critical value: F = 3.5546.

Reject the null hypothesis. There does appear to be an interaction effect.
12) H0:  The cars have the same mean mileage.  H1:  The cars do not have the same mean mileage.  The
P-value is 0.000249, which is less than 0.05.  We reject the null hypothesis; it appears that the cars do not
have the same mean mileage.
13) H0:  There is no teacher effect.  H1:  There is a teacher effect.  The P-value is 0.404, which is greater than
0.05.  We fail to reject the null hypothesis; it appears that the teacher does not affect the class average.
14) H0:  The brands of gas provide the same mean mileage.  H1:  The brands of gas do not provide the same
mean mileage.  The P-value is 0.200726, which is greater than 0.05.  We fail to reject the null hypothesis;
it appears that the brands of gas provide the same mean mileage.
15) H0:  Education level has no effect on income.  H1:  Education level has an effect on income.  The test
statistic is F = 41.26823, and the corresponding P-value is 0.000000189.  Because the P-value is less than
0.05, we reject the null hypothesis that education level has no effect on income.  It appears that
education level does have an effect on income.
16) The ANOVA results are not affected by converting the times to hours.  The null hypothesis of no
interaction between machine and gender is not rejected since the P-value is 0.946.  The null hypothesis
of no effect from machine is rejected since the P-value is 0.013.  The null hypothesis of no effect from
gender is not rejected since the P-value is 0.382.

second approach is to treat half the 0s (representing ties) as positive signs and half as negative
signs.  In this approach, if the number of ties is odd, one tie is excluded so that they can be
divided equally.  In a sign test for matched pairs with a claim that the median of the differences

SHORT ANSWER.  Write the word or phrase that best completes each statement or answers the question.
1) The runs test for randomness is a procedure for testing the randomness of data (with only two
characteristics) using the concepts of runs. A run is a sequence of data that exhibit the same
characteristic. For example, the data set M M M M M F F F M M F F F F has four runs. The null
hypothesis is that the sequence is random and the alternate hypothesis is that the sequence is not
random. The runs test is based only on the order in which the data occur; it does not test the frequency
of the data. The underlying concept is that if the number of runs is very low or very high, randomness is
lacking.
2) The Wilcoxon signed-ranks test is similar to the sign test, but it looks at the magnitude as well as the
signs of the differences, and thus has a higher efficiency level than the signs test. The test is used to test
claims about differences between two dependent (paired) samples. The Wilcoxon signed-ranks test
assumes that the population of the differences (found from the pairs of data) has a distribution that is
approximately symmetric and that the pairs have been randomly selected.
3) H0: The math scores are equal to or less than the verbal scores.
H1: The math scores are greater than the verbal scores.
Test statistic: x = 0. Critical value: x = 1.
Reject the null hypothesis. There is sufficient evidence to support the claim that the math scores are
greater than the verbal scores.
4) H0: the diet is not effective. H1: the diet is effective.
Convert x = 40 to the test statistic z = -0.95. Critical value: z = -2.33.
Fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is not sufficient evidence to support the claim that the diet is
effective.
5) Test statistic T = 16.5. Critical value: T = 8.
Fail to reject the null hypothesis that both samples come from the same population distribution.
6) mR = 143,  sR = 18.2665,  R = 90.
Test statistic: z = -2.90.  Critical values z = ±1.96.
Reject the null hypothesis. There is sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis that the two programs
produce different results.
7) Approach 1:
Test statistic: z = -1.98,  Critical values: z = ±1.96.
Reject the null hypothesis that the median of the differences is zero.
Approach 2:
Test statistic:  z = -1.78,  Critical values: z = ±1.96.
Do not reject the null hypothesis that the median of the differences is zero.
8) Test statistic: H = 10.371. Critical value is 9.210.
Reject the null hypothesis. There is sufficient evidence to warrant rejection of the claim that the samples
come from identical populations.
9) rs = 0.296. Critical values: rs = ±0.418.
No significant correlation. There does not appear to be a correlation between the two variables.
10) rs = 0.706. Critical values: rs = ±0.591.
Significant correlation. There appears to be a correlation between midterm score and final exam score.
11) rs = 0.382. Critical values: rs = ±0.648.
No significant correlation. There does not appear to be a correlation between comfort and price.

SHORT ANSWER.  Write the word or phrase that best completes each statement or answers the question.
1) The sign test compares the signs (negative or positive) of the differences for data sets, ignoring any ties
resulting in a difference of zero. The sign test can be used to test claims involving two dependent
samples, claims involving nominal data, and claims about the median of a single population. The
underlying concept is that if two sets of data have equal medians, the number of positive signs should
be approximately equal to the number of negative signs.
2) The Wilcoxon rank-sum test looks at ranks but not signs for the data points. The test is used to test
claims about the differences between two independent samples. The assumptions include: two
randomly selected independent samples; testing the null hypothesis that the two independent samples
come from the same distribution; and more than 10 scores in each of the samples. The underlying
principle is that if two samples are drawn from identical populations and the individual scores are all
ranked as one combined collection of values, then the high and low ranks should fall evenly between
the two samples. For example, if low ranks are found predominantly in one sample with the high ranks
in the other, then we suspect that the two samples are not identical.
3) H0: There is no difference between before and after grades.
H1: There is a difference between before and after grades.
Test statistic: x = 0. Critical value: x = 2.
Reject the null hypothesis of no difference. There is sufficient evidence to warrant rejection of the claim
that the lesson has no effect on grade.
4) H0: the music has no effect on memorization skills.
H1: the music has an effect on memorization skills.
Convert x = 22 to the test statistic z = -4.58. Critical values: z = ±1.96.
Reject the null hypothesis. There is sufficient evidence to warrant rejection of the claim that music has
no effect on memorization skills.
5) Test statistic T = 0. Critical value: T = 6.
Reject the null hypothesis that both samples come from the same population distribution.
6) mR = 126.5, sR = 15.2288,  R = 108.5.
Test statistic: z = -1.18. Critical values z = ±1.96.
Fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is not sufficient evidence to warrant rejection of the claim that
the two populations are identical.
7) H0:  The sample comes from a population with a median of 130 pounds.
H1:  The sample comes from a population with a median different from 130 pounds.
Test statistic: T = 32.5
Critical value: 14
Do not reject the null hypothesis.  There is not sufficient evidence to reject the hypothesis that the
sample comes from a population with a median of 130 pounds.
8) Test statistic: H = 0.8158. Critical value is 9.210.
Fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is not sufficient evidence to warrant rejection of the claim that
the samples come from identical populations.
9) rs = -0.474. Critical values: rs = ±0.234.
Significant correlation. There appears to be a correlation between the two variables.
10) rs = 0.531. Critical values: rs = ±0.591. (Ranking both variables from lowest to highest).
No significant correlation. The data do not provide sufficient evidence to indicate that age and GPA are
correlated.
11) rs = -0.285. Critical values: rs = ±0.648.
No significant correlation. There does not appear to be a correlation between comfort and price.

SHORT ANSWER.  Write the word or phrase that best completes each statement or answers the question.
1) The Kruskal-Wallis test sums ranks for the sample data ranked as a whole. However, the
Kruskal-Wallis test is used to test claims about the differences in means among three or more
independent samples, as opposed to the Wilcoxon rank-sum test which looks at claims for two
independent samples. The assumptions include: there are at least three random samples; we want to test
the null hypothesis that the samples come from the same or identical populations; and each sample has
at least five observations.
2) The rank correlation test uses ranks to measure the strength of the relation between two variables. The
rank correlation test is used to test the null hypothesis that there is no correlation between the two
variables. In Chapter 9, the correlation coefficient r was linear. The rank correlation rs, also known as
Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, detects relationships which are non-linear as well as linear.
3) H0: The diet does not have an effect on blood pressure.
H1: The diet has an effect on blood pressure.
Test statistic: x = 7. Critical value: x = 5.
Fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is not sufficient evidence to support the claim that the diet has
an effect on blood pressure.
4) H0: median is equal to 5.3 minutes.
H1: median is not equal to 5.3 minutes.
Convert x = 7 to the test statistic z = -2.31. Critical values: z = ±1.96.
Reject the null hypothesis. There is sufficient evidence to warrant rejection of the claim that the
population median is equal to 5.3 minutes.
5) Test statistic T = 12.5. Critical value: T = 14.
Reject the null hypothesis that both samples come from the same population distribution.
6) mR = 126.5, sR = 15.2288,  R = 90.
Test statistic: z = -2.40. Critical values z = ±1.645.
Reject the null hypothesis. There is sufficient evidence to warrant rejection of the claim that the two
populations are identical.
7) H0:  The two samples come from populations with the same distribution.
H1:  The two samples come from populations with different  distributions.
Critical values z = ± 1.96, R = 115.5.
Test statistic:  z = 0.39
Do not reject the null hypothesis.  There is not sufficient evidence to reject the claim that the two
samples come from populations with the same distribution.
8) Test statistic: H = 3.6586. Critical value is 5.9915.
Fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is not sufficient evidence to warrant rejection of the claim that
the samples come from identical populations.

SHORT ANSWER.  Write the word or phrase that best completes each statement or answers the question.
1) Random variation is due to chance, the variation inherent in any process that is not capable of
producing each good or service exactly the same way every time. Assignable variation results from
causes that can be identified. Examples may vary.
2) Control charts have upper control limits and lower control limits found by processes similar to those in
Chapter 6 for finding confidence intervals. Control charts allow us to examine processes to see if they
remain within control, that is, within the confidence intervals.

SHORT ANSWER.  Write the word or phrase that best completes each statement or answers the question.
1) Process data are data arranged according to some time sequence. Process data are important to
businesses because important characteristics of process data can change over time, and businesses are
interested in ensuring quality by controlling these important characteristics. Businesses using quality
control are interested in reducing variability in characteristics of their product.
2) A process is statistically stable if it has only natural variation, with no patterns, cycles, or any unusual
points. Any of the graphs in Figure 13-2 would apply: graphs with an obvious upward or downward
trend, graphs with an upward or downward shift (relatively stable values for the first few, a shift,
relatively stable values at the end), graphs with one exceptionally high or low value, graphs with
cyclical behavior, or graphs whose variation is increasing over time.
3)
4) The process appears to be within statistical control.

SHORT ANSWER.  Write the word or phrase that best completes each statement or answers the question.
1) A run chart is a sequential plot of individual data values over time. The horizontal axis typically is used
for the time sequence, and the vertical axis is used for the values of the data.
2) A control chart of a process characteristic (such as a mean or range) consists of values plotted
sequentially over time, and it includes a center line, representing a central value of the characteristic
measurement, as well as lower and upper control limits, representing boundaries used to separate and
identify any points considered to be unusual.

11) The process which has been having a 10% of nonconforming items would have wider control limits.  It
would be easier to detect a shift from 5% to 10% than a shift from 10% to 15%, because at a 5% rate of
nonconforming items, the control limits are narrower, and it thus takes a smaller shift before the
proportion falls outside the control limits.
