About the Authors
Richard Booker is a doctoral student at Rice University working under Dr.
Richard Smalley, discoverer of the buckyball. He was lucky enough to get an
outstanding education, starting with four intense years at Boston University
earning a computer-engineering degree. After college, he joined the Air Force,
where he managed weapon systems and researched battlespace networks
while simultaneously working on his master’s degree in computer engineering.
After four years, Captain Booker left the wild blue yonder to pursue his Ph.D.
in applied physics at Rice and delve into the “new” world of nanotechnology.
Rich’s next ambitious adventure will be developing the armchair quantum
wire (see Chapters 4 and 5 of this book) and helping to bring other nano-
applications to market. His interests include flying, skydiving, scuba diving,
music, art, movies and, in his spare time, working on being humble.
Earl Boysen is an engineer who, after 20 years in the computer-chip industry,
decided to “slow down” and move to a quiet town in Washington. Earl is the
co-author of Electronics For Dummies, and holds degrees in chemistry and
physics. He lives in a house he designed and built himself, and keeps as busy
as ever writing, acting, teaching math and science, dancing, and walking.


Dedication
For Him who gave us wisdom and heart to help each other.
For my fantastically supportive parents, Richard and Lorraine: Dad, whose
insatiable appetite for knowledge, tenacity, and hard work ethic led me by
example; and Mom, whose great teaching, organizational skills, and love kept
me sane during my writing.
— R.B.
To my wonderful lady, Nancy, who (as well as providing support during the
writing of this book) is the best thing that ever happened to me.
— E.B.


Authors’ Acknowledgments
We’d like to thank our acquisitions editor, Katie Feltman, for giving us this
opportunity and Richard Smalley for permitting his graduate student (Rich)
to write this book in his “spare time.”
Our project editor Paul Levesque and copy editor Barry Childs-Helton did a
fantastic job at deciphering our nano-lingo and “Dummying” the rest. The
graphic artists at Wiley did a great job at reproducing graphics — and a spe-
cial thanks to those who provided use of photos free of charge; both fulfilled
our vision of visually representing nanotech.
Special thanks to Nancy Stevenson for helping out on several of the chapters.
We’d also like to thank some of our tech reviewers:
Drs. Enrique Barrera, Wade Adams, and Howard Schmidt
Ph.D.s in training Joseph Cole, Aaron Saenz, Erik Haroz, Sungbae Lee, and
Tushar Prasad
To our Web site developer, Jasyn Chen — thanks for all your hard work and
generosity.
And yes, nanoscientists do marry supermodels.

Introduction
H
ave you been reading the latest science magazines and noticed that the
word “nano” has become as ubiquitous as the word “calorie” in a diet
book? Are you looking for the latest hot investment opportunity and you’ve
heard that something called nanotechnology will someday revolutionize our
lives, and quite possibly your portfolio?
Well, you’ve come to the right place! Nanotechnology For Dummies is a fantas-
tic way to get beyond all the hype and really understand what nanotechnol-
ogy is and where it’s headed. This is no dry, scientific journal; what you hold
in your hands is a book that gives you just what you need to comprehend 
the basic concepts of nanotechnology, discover what nanotechnologists 
are making happen today, and get a look at the groundwork for tomorrow’s
nano-applications.
Why Buy This Book?
Even though nanotechnology deals with the very small, the topic itself is
huge and complex. Like any technology, it consists of a lot of concepts and 
all sorts of cool but obscure jargon. Add to that, nanotechnology isn’t just
one science; it touches on a variety of sciences such as physics, chemistry,
mechanical engineering, materials science, and biology. That’s because, in 
all these disciplines and others, nanotechnology is simply the study of all
things happening on a small — we mean REALLY small — scale that produce
big (sometimes REALLY big) effects.
But this book provides you with just what you need to understand the basics
of nanotechnology and its potential in your life and business in simple to
understand language. This book doesn’t pretend to answer all questions
about nanotechnology because, frankly, nano is so cutting-edge that new
questions about it are coming up every day. But what we’ve put together 
here does give you a good grounding in the essentials — and makes this
exciting area of technology fun!

Why Nanotechnology?
We figure you have heard the term nanotechnology (unless you live in a cave)
and have at least a passing interest in learning more, or you wouldn’t have
picked up this book. But what exactly is it about nanotechnology that makes
it worth your while to explore?
Well, how about the probability that nanotechnology is the future? With the
study of nano-size particles, devices, and composites, we will find ways to
make stronger materials, detect diseases in the bloodstream, build extremely
tiny machines, generate light and energy, and purify water.
In the business and investing world, the changes nanotechnology will bring 
in the next few decades will change the way people consume things — and, 
if you hadn’t heard yet, we do live in a consumer society, which means that
businesses and investors are more than slightly interested in technologies
set to revolutionize the manufacturing of consumer goods. Fabrics in our
clothing will become stronger and more stain-resistan — and keep us warmer.
Cosmetics will gain skin-healing properties to keep us looking younger. TV
flat-panel displays will become crisper, and solar cells will become more 
cost-effective. Drugs will have fewer side effects, as nanotechnology helps
your body absorb them more completely and quickly.
In fact, there is probably not a walk of life that won’t be affected by nanotech-
nology eventually. If that’s not enough of a reason to read this book, how
about this: Nanotechnology is just downright fascinating!
Foolish Assumptions
This book doesn’t assume much, except that you have an interest in nanotech-
nology. You don’t need a degree in physics or chemistry. We explain scientific
concepts in a down-to-earth way so anyone with a passing interest in nanotech
should have no trouble finding his or her way through the chapters. We also
don’t assume you know all the scientific buzzwords; that’s why we define terms
as we go.
We can’t assume you will read this book from front to back in order. So if you
decided to jump to Chapter 10 because it looks interesting (it is!), you won’t
be lost. We provide cross-references where relevant information is explained,
and repeat the most important terms and ideas when necessary.

Nanotechnology For Dummies 

How This Book Is Organized
Nanotechnology For Dummies is organized so you can quickly find, read, and
understand the information you need — and if you want to move around the
various topics, you can skip chapters and move on to the parts that interest
you.
The chapters in this book are divided into parts that help you get right to the
information you’re looking for. Here’s the rundown . . .
Part I: Getting Small with Nanotechnology
Chapter 1 is where you get the overview of the nanotechnology realm, dis-
covering what it is and how it is changing our world. You get an idea of how 
a nanotechnology product goes from concept to reality, as well as some of
the challenges that have to be overcome to put nanotechnology in place in
Chapter 2. Chapter 3 goes over those basic scientific concepts you should
probably have under your belt if you really want to get your arms around
nanotechnology, including what goes on inside molecules and how
researchers are “seeing” things way too tiny to see.
Part II: Building a Better World 
with Nanomaterials
By building things from incredibly small particles, we can improve the
strength of those materials. In Chapter 4 you hear all about things like carbon
nanotubes, nanowires, and something called buckyballs. Chapter 5 examines
how composite materials use nano-scale elements to make all kinds of things
better, stronger, and faster — from plastics to bulletproof vests to who-
knows-what-else. (Talk about limitless possibilities!)
Part III: “Smarter” Computers! Faster
Internet! Cheaper Energy!
If Silicon Valley is your kind of place, you’ll like this part. Chapter 6 is where
we look at all the things being done with transistors, computer-chip manufac-
turing, and computer memory. In Chapter 7 we tell you how people are telling
photons where to go, using light to improve telecommunications and other
3
Introduction

industries. Chapter 8 covers how nanotechnology is changing electronics
with new ways to generate light, sense things, and build tiny electromechani-
cal devices. This stuff is so cool that . . . well, let’s just say you won’t find it at
your local Radio Shack (yet)! Finally, Chapter 9 looks at how cleaner energy
can be generated with nanotechnology, and how it might improve our envi-
ronment in the future.
Part IV: Living Healthier Lives
Chapters 10 and 11 are where you hear all about the promise of nanotechnol-
ogy in diagnosing and curing all that ails us. From more efficient drug deliv-
ery to sending tiny diagnostic machines into our bloodstreams, to vastly
improving medical imaging and the mapping of our genes, medical science is
super-excited about nano-scale solutions.
Part V: Investing in Nanotech
Corporations, universities, and military/government labs are all working
together to further nanotechnology research because it’s got so much
promise in so many applications. Discover in these three chapters where the
research is happening, where advances are being made, and where the big
wins are likely to occur. If you’re interested in speculating on the future of
nano with your checkbook, this part is for you.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
Every For Dummies book rounds things out with a few chapters that follow
that tried-and-true List of Ten format. In Chapter 15 you hear all about ten
movers and shakers in nanotechnology, and in Chapter 16 we cover ten
resources in print and on the Web that you just have to check out if we’ve
managed to get you excited about the nano realm.
Icons Used in This Book
A picture is worth a thousand words, so this book uses little graphic icons to
visually point out useful information that you may want to know more about.

The Tip icon indicates information that might be of interest for further explo-
ration or lead you into new ideas. These icons tend to point out tidbits that
make exploring nanotechnology more enjoyable, so don’t just skip ’em!
Remember icons are gentle reminders about important ideas or facts that
you should keep in mind while exploring nanotechnology. We also use these
icons to cross-reference places in the book where we talk about a topic in
more detail, so you can flip to those chapters and brush up if you want to.
We can’t help it: Occasionally there will be technical information in this book.
(No kidding?) But we thought you might appreciate a little warning when the
relatively obscure stuff crops up. So when there’s highly technical informa-
tion just ahead (even if it’s all really interesting stuff, as any of us completely
unbiased authors would tell you), we may tuck one of these icons next to it.

anotechnology is the hot buzzword of the new 
millennium. But what, exactly, is it? 
In this part, we start sketching out the answers. We give
you the broad overview of nanotechnology in Chapter 1 —
what it is, where it came from, what’s being produced
today, and where the whole thing is heading. We address
some of the hurdles that nanotech will have to jump to
make progress (Chapter 2), and Chapter 3 gives you a look
at some scientific terms, concepts, and souped-up nano-
equipment needed to delve deeper into the topic.

elcome to the world of nanotechnology — technology capable of ful-
filling our every need (almost). It’s safe to assume that you know a
little bit about nanotechnology from picking up this book. However, you may
have a few unanswered questions. Maybe you’ve heard it described as “The
Next Industrial Revolution” on the news followed by some business commen-
tary. Maybe you’re a Will Smith fan and saw his 2004 movie I, Robot, where
“nanites” save the day, dismantling the main computer from the inside. Other
than a financial topic or clever plot device, what is nanotechnology (exactly)?
Do I need nanotechnology? Will I be able to cash in on a “nanotechnology
bubble” or will I lose my shirt as I did with the dot-coms? These are all fair
questions; we address each of them in this chapter.
Grasping the Essence of Nanotechnology
We start off this chapter by defining nanotechnology and showing you not
only the need but also the inevitability of this technology. We then go into
detail explaining what you can expect from nanotechnology. (Short, sharp,
and to the point — that’s our motto!)

Finding out what it is
Nano, Greek for “dwarf,” means one billionth. Measurement at this level is in
nanometers (abbreviated “nm”) — billionths of a meter. To put this into per-
spective, a strand of human hair is roughly 75,000 nm across. On the flipside
of the concept, you’d need ten hydrogen atoms lined up end-to-end to make
up 1 nm. Figure 1-1 illustrates the differences in scale that range from you all
the way down to one hydrogen atom.
The definition
Nanotechnology can be difficult to determine and define. For example, the
realm of nanoscience is not new; chemists will tell you they’ve been doing
nanoscience for hundreds of years. Stained-glass windows found in medieval
churches contain different-size gold nanoparticles incorporated into the 
glass — the specific size of the particles creating orange, purple, red, or
greenish colors. Einstein, as part of his doctoral dissertation, calculated 
the size of a sugar molecule as one nanometer. Loosely considered, both 
the medieval glass workers and Einstein were nanoscientists. What’s new
about current nanoscience is its aggressive focus on developing applied 
technology — and the emergence of the right tools for the job.
When faced with a squishy term that can mean different things to different
people, the best thing to do is to form a committee and charge it with draw-
ing up a working definition. In fact, a committee was formed (the National
Nanotechnology Initiative) and the following defining features of nanotech-
nology were hammered out:
1. Nanotechnology involves research and technology development at the
1nm-to-100nm range.
2. Nanotechnology creates and uses structures that have novel properties
because of their small size.
3. Nanotechnology builds on the ability to control or manipulate at the
atomic scale.
Numbers 1 and 3 are pretty straightforward, but Number 2 uses the eyebrow-
raising term “novel properties.” When we go nano, the interactions and
physics between atoms display exotic properties that they don’t at larger
scales. “How exotic?” you ask? Well, at this level atoms leave the realm of
classical physical properties behind, and venture into the world of quantum
mechanics. David Rotman described this best in his 1999 article, “Will the
Real Nanotech Please Stand Up?” (published in the March/April edition of
Technology Review), when he quoted Mark Reed, a nanoelectronics scientist
at Yale University:
“Physical intuition fails miserably in the nanoworld . . . you see all kinds
of unusual effects.” For example, even our everyday electrons act unusual
at the nano level: “It’s like throwing a tennis ball at a garage door and
having the ball pop out the other side.”

Chapter 1: The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Nanotechnology

Need another concrete example? Check this one out. It is demonstrably true
that a gold nanoparticle has a color, melting point, and chemical property dif-
ferent from those you’d find in a macro-scale Fort Knox gold brick. That’s
because the interactions of the gold atoms in the larger gold brick average
out — changing the overall properties and appearance of the object. A single
gold nanoparticle, on the other hand, can be its own idiosyncratic self — a
tiny object, free from the averaging effects of countless other gold atoms.
The applications
Nanotechnology is, at heart, interdisciplinary. You’ll get only part of the story
if you just use chemistry to get at the properties of atoms on the nano level —
adding physics and quantum mechanics to the mix gives you a truer picture.
Chemists, physicists, and medical doctors are working alongside engineers,
biologists, and computer scientists to determine the applications, direction,
and development of nanotechnology — in essence, nanotechnology is many
disciplines building upon one another. Industries such as materials manufac-
turing, computer manufacturing, and healthcare will all contribute, meaning
that all will benefit — both directly from nanotechnological advances, and
indirectly from advances made by fellow players in the nano field. (Imagine,
for example, quantum computers simulating the effectiveness of new nano-
based medicines.)
There are two approaches to fabricating at the nano scale: top-down and
bottom-up. A top-down approach is similar to a sculptor cutting away at a block
of marble — we first work at a large scale and then cut away until we have our
nano-scale product. (The computer industry uses this approach when creating
their microprocessors.) The other approach is bottom-up manufacturing, which
entails building our product one atom at a time. This can be time-consuming,
so a so-called self-assembly process is employed — under specific conditions,
the atoms and molecules spontaneously arrange themselves into the final
product. (Self-assembly is described further in Chapter 8.)
Some science-fiction plots — they know who they are — revolve around this
self-assembly concept, conjuring up plot lines infested with tiny self-replicating
machines running amok. (For a closer look at this far-fetched notion, see the
“Welcome to Nano Park” sidebar in this chapter.) For the near-term, it looks
like the top-down approach will be favored because it tends to provide us
with greater control (and, more importantly, it uses some time-tested tech-
niques of the computer industry). If we were betting men — which we are
not, because as men of science we know that the House always wins — we
would venture that the top-down approach will be the fabrication method of
choice for quite awhile.

The history
The word “nanotechnology” proper was coined by Nario Taniguchi in 1974 to
describe machining with tolerances of less than a micron. But this really isn’t
the term’s true beginning. Three noteworthy events and discoveries got this
ball rolling — all by Nobel laureates (and when a Nobel Prize winner says
something, you listen . . . and try to understand).
 The Vision: In 1959, Caltech physicist Richard Feynman gives his famed
talk “There’s Plenty of Room at the Bottom,” outlining the prospects for
atomic engineering. (To read the talk in its entirety, check out www.its.
caltech.edu/~feynman/plenty.html for a handy transcript.)

Chapter 1: The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Nanotechnology
Evolving into Nanotech
If you take a look at the world around us, you’ll
notice that nature herself designs at the molecu-
lar level. Nanotechnology intends to imitate
nature by taking advantage of the unique proper-
ties of nano-scale matter to come up with more
efficient ways of controlling and manipulating
molecules. With technology, smaller is better. If
you take a look at technical evolution, you’ll
notice that we’re continually getting smaller —
computers the size of a room in the 1950s now fit
on your lap; cellphones the size of a brick in the
1980s now fit in your shirt pocket. Consumer con-
venience, the economics of resources and com-
petition, and the advantages of faster processing,
higher productivity, and better quality all play a
part in motivating companies to go small.
Technology is not only getting smaller, it’s also
evolving faster. As new technologies develop,
we build upon previous knowledge. Thanks to
the Internet, this knowledge base — and rate of
information exchange — is increasing rapidly.
To illustrate this evolution of technology, check
out the evolution of electrical components: from
the vacuum tube to the solid-state transistor to
the carbon nanotube field effect transistor.
 Vacuum Tube (1897): This was the ancestor
of the transistor, essentially a light bulb with
three, instead of two, terminals. It was
large, hot, and prone to burning out.
 Solid-State Transistor (1947): Instead of
using a filament, the solid-state transistor
switches between On and Off using differ-
ent materials — metals and semiconduc-
tors. This let us come up with transistors
that were smaller in size, didn’t give off as
much heat, and were far more durable.
 Carbon Nanotube Transistor (1998):A carbon
nanotube (refer to Figure 1-1) — a graphite
sheet rolled into a tube — comes in two main
forms, metallic and semiconducting. The
carbon nanotube was discovered in 1991 and
within only seven years, was used for shut-
tling electrons across two electrodes. Not
only is it incredibly small (nano-scale), but it
also uses less energy and gives off less heat
by using few electrons to indicate whether
it’s on or off. (For more on carbon nanotubes,
see Chapter 4.)
It took 50 years to get from the vacuum tube to
the first solid-state transistor — and another 50
years of refinement to get solid-state transistors
to be all they could be. But when we’d devel-
oped the needed tools and understanding, it
only took seven years from the discovery of the
carbon nanotube to turn it into what may be the
ultimate transistor.

 Seeing is Believing: In 1981, Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer of IBM’s
Zurich Research Laboratory create the scanning tunneling microscope,
enabling researchers to both see and manipulate atoms for the first
time. (For more on the scanning tunneling microscope, see Chapter 3.)
 Nanostructures: In 1985, Robert F. Curl Jr., Harold W. Kroto, and Richard E.
Smalley discover buckminsterfullerenes (buckyballs — refer to Figure 1-1),
soccer-ball-shaped molecules made of carbon and measuring roughly
0.7nm wide. (For more on buckyballs, see Chapter 4.)
Why you want nanotechnology in your life
Nanotechnology will increase your standard of living — no ifs, ands, or buts.
Done right, it will make our lives more secure, improve healthcare delivery,
and optimize our use of limited resources. Pretty basic stuff, in other words.
Mankind has spent millennia trying to fill these needs, because it has always
known that these are the things it needs to ensure a future for itself. If nan-
otechnological applications pan out the way we think they will pan out, we
are one step closer to ensuring that future.
Security
Security is a broad field, covering everything from the security of our borders
to the security of our infrastructure to the security of our computer net-
works. Here’s our take on how nanotechnology will revolutionize the whole
security field:
 Superior, lightweight materials: Imagine materials ten times stronger
than steel at a fraction of the weight. With such materials, nanotechnology
could revolutionize tanks, airframes, spacecraft, skyscrapers, bridges, and
body armor, providing unprecedented protection. Composite nanomateri-
als may one day lead to shape-shifting wings instead of the mechanical
flaps on current designs. Kevlar, the backbone fiber of bulletproof vests,
will be replaced with materials that not only provide better protection 
but store energy and monitor the health status of our soldiers. A taste of
what’s to come: MIT was awarded a $50 million Army contract in 2002 to
launch the Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies (ISN) developing artifi-
cial muscles, biowarfare sensors, and communications systems.
 Advanced computing: More powerful and smaller computers will
encrypt our data and provide round-the-clock security. Quantum cryp-
tography — cryptography that utilizes the unique properties of quan-
tum mechanics — will provide unbreakable security for businesses,
government, and military. These same quantum mechanics will be used
to construct quantum computers capable of breaking current encryption
14
Part I: Getting Small with Nanotechnology 

techniques (a needed advantage in the war against terror). Additionally,
quantum computers provide better simulations to predict natural disas-
ters and pattern recognition to make biometrics — identification based
on personal features such as face recognition — possible.
 Increased situational awareness: Chemical sensors based on nanotech-
nology will be incredibly sensitive — capable, in fact, of pinpointing a
single molecule out of billions. These sensors will be cheap and dispos-
able, forewarning us of airport-security breaches or anthrax-laced letters.
These sensors will eventually take to the air on military unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs), not only sensing chemicals but also providing incredible
photo resolutions. These photos, condensed and on an energy-efficient,
high resolution, wristwatch-sized display, will find their way to the sol-
dier, providing incredible real-time situational awareness at the place
needed most: the front lines.
 Powerful munitions: Nanometals, nano-sized particles of metal such as
nanoaluminum, are more chemically reactive because of their small size
and greater surface area. Varying the size of these nanometals in muni-
tions allows us to control the explosion, minimizing collateral damage.
Incorporating nanometals into bombs and propellants increases the
speed of released energy with fewer raw materials consumed — more
(and better-directed) “bang” for your buck.
Healthcare
Making the world around us more secure is one thing, but how about making
the world inside us more secure? With nanotechnology, what’s beneath our
skin is going to be more accessible to us than it’s ever been before. Here’s
what we see happening:
 Diagnostics: Hospitals will benefit greatly from nanotechnology with
faster, cheaper diagnostic equipment. The lab-on-a-chip is waiting in the
wings to analyze a patient’s ailments in an instant, providing point-of-
care testing and drug application, thus taking out a lot of the diagnostic
guesswork that has plagued healthcare up to now. New contrast agents
will float through the bloodstream, lighting up problems such as tumors
with incredible accuracy. Not only will nanotechnology make diagnostic
tests better, but it will also make them more portable, providing time-
sensitive diagnostics out in the field on ambulances. Newborn children
will have their DNA quickly mapped, pointing out future potential prob-
lems, allowing us to curtail disease before it takes hold.
 Novel drugs: Nanotechnology will aid in the delivery of just the right
amount of medicine to the exact spots of the body that need it most.
Nanoshells, approximately 100nm in diameter, will float through the
body, attaching only to cancer cells. When excited by a laser beam, the
nanoshells will give off heat — in effect, cooking the tumor and destroy-
ing it. Nanotechnology will create biocompatible joint replacements and
artery stents that will last the life of the patient instead of having to be
replaced every few years.
15
Chapter 1: The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Nanotechnology

Resources
The only thing not in short supply these days is more human beings — and
we’re not about to see a shortage of them any time soon. If we are going to
survive at all — much less thrive — we are going to need to find ways to use
the riches of this world more efficiently. Here’s how nanotechnology could
help:
 Energy: Nanotechnology is set to provide new methods to effectively
utilize our current energy resources while also presenting new alterna-
tives. Cars will have lighter and stronger engine blocks and frames and
will use new additives making fuel more efficient. House lighting will use
quantum dots — nanocrystals 5nm across — in order to transform elec-
tricity into light instead of wasting away into heat. Solar cells will finally
become cost effective and hydrogen fuel cells will get a boost from nano-
materials and nanocomposites. Our Holy Grail will be a reusable catalyst
that quickly breaks down water in the presence of sunlight, making that
long-wished-for hydrogen economy realistic. That catalyst, whatever it
is, will be constructed with nanotechnology.
 Water: Nanotechnology will provide efficient water purification tech-
niques, allowing third-world countries access to clean water. When we
satisfy our energy requirements, desalinization of water from our oceans
will not only provide enough water to drink but also enough to water
our crops.
You say you want a revolution?
We predict that a few revolutions will roll over us in the course of the next 50
years — revolutions that will have great impact on our lifestyles and econ-
omy, and will involve nanotechnology, energy, and robotics. We’ve broken
down each revolution here, complete with an estimated peak year for each
one’s public and financial popularity. Note, however, that nobody’s jumped in
a time machine to check up ahead; these peak years are based on the “gut
feelings” of the authors, and on our research and observations of current
trends. But we aren’t just spinning tales. In February 2005, Business Week
Online polled its readers, asking when they thought nanotechnology would
change their lives: 34 percent said by 2007; an additional 51 percent said by
2015. At this point, it’s not a matter of “if” but a matter of “when” — it’s nearly
as certain as death and taxes.
 Nanotechnology itself: We’re thinking 2012 is about the time that signifi-
cant revolutionary products will be available, along with solid companies
within the industry. A “nanotechnology bubble” will begin to develop
around 2010, but this may not be as drastic as the “Internet bubble.” 
(See the “Getting a (Small) Piece of Nanotechnology for Yourself” section,
later in this chapter.) Low-power, high-density computer memory, longer-
lasting batteries, and some medical applications (including cancer ther-
apy and diagnostics) will be some of the early products (pre-2010).
16
Part I: Getting Small with Nanotechnology 

Advances in computer processing will follow (2015), and new materials
and composites will come online toward 2020. The order of events will
likely be computers and medical first, and then materials — all overlap-
ping but peaking at their respective years.
Energy: Our crystal ball says 2025 is going to be the Nanotechnology
Energy Year. With demand for energy rising in industrializing countries
such as China and India, oil will continue to be that highly-sought-after
resource. Oil prices and prosperity have an inverse relationship — as 
oil prices go up, prosperity goes down. Goldman Sachs has recently
(April 2005) suggested that we may enter into a “super-spike” period 
of oil demand, with prices as high as $105 a barrel — almost twice the
current price. It has also been suggested (by Princeton University 
geologist Kenneth Deffeyes) that world oil production will peak around
Thanksgiving 2005. Unfortunately, production capacity has grown more
slowly than demand, which makes things even worse.
Nanotechnology will combine efficient use of our current sources 
while providing directions to explore for alternate sources of energy.
Nanomaterials that emerge around 2020 will not only provide lighter/
stronger materials for vehicles but will also improve efficiency in the 
collection, storage, and transmission of energy, greatly aiding our transi-
tion from gas to solar, hydrogen, or maybe even renewable bio-fuels (for
example, vegetable oils and bioalcohols such as ethanol and methanol).
Robotics: Think 2045. This may seem a little farfetched, because you
expect something with the personality of C3-PO and the powers of a
Jedi, but today you’re getting R2-D2 — just bells and whistles. However,
there are a few driving forces making robotics economically feasible:
defense, space exploration, and labor. In the near term, autonomous
UAVs (short for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) will keep continuous watch
over our borders, and robots will dispose of roadside bombs in the bat-
tlefield. Space exploration will be done by robots, cutting the need for
human involvement and thus allowing us to go farther than we’ve ever
gone before.
As nanotechnology develops better sensors and processors and the
energy revolution provides abundantly cheap energy, robots will be in
demand as cheap manual labor, increasing our overall standard of living.
Not only will we have robotic dogs and vacuum cleaners but also assem-
bly-line industrial labor, bringing money back to Western nations. Perhaps
a “robotic arms race” will emerge, not as a mighty military machine but as
a productivity machine — each nation trying to make the cheapest goods
as quickly as possible. All this will gradually grow over the next few
decades — but once the hardware is in place (around 2030), the software
and artificial intelligence will soon follow.
Some of these years may seem a long way off, but these changes will arrive
faster than you may think. If you’re currently in college, they’ll happen in
your lifetime.

Chapter 1: The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Nanotechnology

Knowing what to expect (and not expect)
Futuristic excitement aside, our expectations for nanotechnology need to be
realistic and we need to be patient, for not all the advances that nanotechnol-
ogy is set to bring will happen overnight. Nanotechnology will not be a mira-
cle cure. Although there will be some fantastic advances, not everything that
we imagine will come to fruition. However, nanotechnology is also sure to
usher in things that we never envisioned coming — products that could end
up changing the world.
Nano-scale science isn’t a free-for-all — there are rules. We won’t be able to
manufacture something that, at the molecular level, is chemically unstable.
Scientists know how most things work chemically and physically, but there
have been a few surprises — and we learn the rules along the way. Time to
take a look at some examples of the nanotechnology we now have, what we
can improve upon, what will be new, and what (we can confidently say) will
never happen.
What we have
Nano applications are already showing up in areas as diverse as computing,
transportation safety, and medicine. The steps may seem modest by future
standards, but they get big effects from tiny things. Three examples illustrate
what we can do now:
 Computer transistors have broken below the 100nm barrier — transis-
tors are officially nano-sized. Look for the devices that house them to
shrink as well, and for devices that are already small (such as cell-
phones) to become more powerful.
 Airbag sensors, although micro in size and bigger than nano, are used in
most recent cars — some of them already saving lives. These sensors
will continue to shrink, becoming more powerful and accurate.
 At least one home pregnancy test (Carter-Wallace’s “First Response”)
uses both gold nanoparticles and micrometer-size latex particles on an
external, disposable test sheet. The product takes advantage of how
gold nanoparticles of different sizes reflect light differently. If a woman is
pregnant, a specific hormone is present that causes the micro-sized and
nano-sized particles to clump together — and those bigger particles
reflect a distinctive color: a visible pink strip appears on the test sheet.
If she’s not pregnant, no hormone is present, which means no clumping
of the nanoparticles and no pink strip.
What will be improved
Besides introducing new products and procedures, nanotech will advance
those that already exist. In January 2005, the Lemelson-MIT Program identified
the top 25 innovations of the past 25 years. Nanotechnology was number 21 . . .
18
Part I: Getting Small with Nanotechnology 

which is good. What’s even better is that the other 24 would all be positively
influenced by nanotechnology. Try these examples on for size:
 Cellphones with longer battery life
 Global Positioning Systems that are smaller and more accurate
 Computers that are faster and smaller
 Memory storage that packs greater capacity into a smaller space and
uses less energy
 DNA fingerprinting that is quick and accurate
Other items not on the list will be oil additives designed to get more out of
our precious resource, new medical diagnostics and drug delivery . . . even
an aesthetically pleasing sunscreen. (Most sunscreens are a white, thick and
sticky cream. Nanophase Technologies has developed a sunscreen that is
transparent — the active ingredient is a nano-scale material that, because of
its small size, doesn’t scatter visible light.) Nanotech will crop up everywhere
in existing products, even — or especially — in places you can’t see.
What will be new
Nanotechnology promises to be a cornucopia of wonders — improving our
healthcare, optimizing our use of resources, increasing our standard of living.
Detecting disease at the molecular level will lead to new treatments for old
ills. The development of materials ten times stronger than steel — but a tenth
of the weight — offers to make transportation faster and more efficient.
(Imagine, for example, how air transportation would change if airframes were
lighter and stronger, plane engines used less fuel, and sensors and smart
material automatically deformed the wings to minimize drag.) New, nanotech-
based paints and coatings will prevent dirt and water from adhering to sur-
faces such as kitchen counters, vinyl siding, cars, and windows. (Imagine a
car you never have to wash, that rolls dirt and water right off so you don’t
even have to use your windshield wipers.)
Speaking of cleanliness, EnviroSystems’ EcoTru disinfectant cleaner is the
only EPA-registered Tox Category IV disinfectant product — it doesn’t harm
the skin, eyes, lungs, or body if ingested. Conventional disinfectants dissolve
in a solvent, and are meant to drown the organisms with toxic chemicals —
which can be about as bad for humans as for small organisms. EcoTru uses
nanospheres of charged oil droplets suspended in water to carry the active
ingredient that ends up penetrating the microorganisms’ membranes. This
stuff is so good that Doctors Without Borders used EcoTru in the operating
room as an antiseptic when they ran out of their regular antiseptic. Of the 
500 patients that they used EcoTru on, none got an infection. EcoTru is also
already used as a disinfectant on airplanes, on cruise ships, and in healthcare
facilities, and, given Doctors Without Borders’s experience, may be used as
an antiseptic in the future.
19
Chapter 1: The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Nanotechnology

What will not happen
Science fiction writers describe swarms of molecule-size robots swimming
through your bloodstream cleaning your arteries while shooting cancer cells.
And the nanobots that aren’t fixing your body are out there fixing and build-
ing the world around us, one atom at a time. These scenarios are highly
improbable, if not impossible. If they do eventually prove possible, they’re
decades (if not centuries) away.
As marvelous as it is to envision nanobots curing our bodies and quickly
assembling and disassembling inanimate objects, these methods may not
even be the most efficient approach. After all, some of the best medicine
involves coaxing the body to help fix itself — and building inanimate objects
one atom at a time (even something as simple as a chair) is no quick task.
There may be a better, more inventive way to use engineering principles at
the nano scale — one that takes advantage of the opportunities that chem-
istry and intermolecular interactions offer. But those opportunities are far
more modest and (well, yeah) small-scale than science fiction would suggest.
The dramatic creation and transformation of macro-scale objects makes for
spectacular entertainment but dicey science. Here’s why: Molecular chem-
istry is very complex and involves controlling atoms in three dimensions. 
At each reaction site, the atoms feel the influence of neighboring atoms. To
do any mechanics at this level (which is what nanobots would have to do 
for this to work), you would need to control the motion of each and every 
atom — a very difficult juggling act.
A lot of this nano-zealous science fiction got started in 1986, when K. 
Eric Drexler, founder of the Foresight Institute (a nonprofit organization 
dedicated to educating the public about nanotechnology), penned Engines 
of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology. In it, he describes self-
replicating nanoassemblers building objects one atom at a time. He also
describes a doomsday scenario referred to as “gray goo” — myriads of self-
replicating nanoassemblers making uncountable copies of themselves and
consuming the earth. “Gray” because they’re machines; “goo” because
they’re so small they’d look like a thick liquid. Scientists have since ridiculed
this Drexlerian vision — even Drexler himself (in 2004) said “runaway replica-
tion” was unlikely.
In the December 1, 2003, edition of Chemical & Engineering News, Eric Drexler
and Richard Smalley, Nobel Prize winner and discoverer of the buckyball,
squared off, arguing for and against molecular manufacturing. The “Point-
Counterpoint” article was a series of letters between the two, where Drexler
continues to outline his “mechanical” molecular manufacturing, whereas
Smalley argues against such a model by describing a need for “chemistry”
even at the nano level. One source of contention is the “gray goo” scenario.
Drexler had presented this scenario as a warning to not let nanotech get out
of hand whereas Smalley sees it as unnecessarily scaring the public on a
doomsday scenario that’s a) highly unlikely and b) threatens public support
for nanotech by harping the negative. In the end, they both disagreed on mol-
ecular manufacturing but continue to promote nanotechnology’s potential.

Getting a (Small) Piece of
Nanotechnology for Yourself
Nanotechnology is set to insinuate its way into our economy in ways that 
we can only imagine — more probably, in ways that we could never dream.
Nanotechnology as an industry will be hard to identify and track, considering
it’s very pervasive — it touches upon a lot of different industries. Familiar
products will be the first to take advantage of nanotech — clothing, cosmet-
ics, and novel industrial coatings. When the processes to make these products
are mastered, new and innovative products will begin to emerge. Businesses
will rise, and those that don’t adapt to this changing environment will fall by
the wayside. Now that you’re salivating at the prospects of making a quick
buck, eager to enter the Lilliputian world of atoms and molecules, this section
of the chapter will temper your appetite and present what we believe to be a
realistic picture of the current industry — and how it will probably play out.

Chapter 1: The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Nanotechnology
Welcome to Nano Park
In 2003, Michael Crichton, the author of Jurassic
Park, published his next sci-fi doomsday book,
Prey. Crichton takes us to the top-secret
research labs of Xymos Technology, where the
self-replicating microscopic machines prey on
the scientists. In the end, the humans prevail
(sorry to ruin the ending, but hey, somebody had
to be left alive to buy the book). This book, and
others like it in the grand tradition of high-tech
disaster fiction, pilfers the most visually stunning
aspects of an emerging technology and then pre-
sents the worst-case scenario of what could go
wrong. Without a conflict (nanobots running
amok) there’s no resolution (humans winning)
and no story. Unfortunately, in an effort to make
his story plausible, Crichton mixes a little too
much science fiction with reality — even the
company name Xymos suggests the name of a
real nanotech company (Zyvex). Here are some
of the many flaws:
 Crichton confuses two basic tools of nan-
otechnology, the scanning-probe micro-
scope and an electron microscope (see
Chapter 3 for an explanation of both).
 The description of a nanobot is a bit off —
“one ten-billionth of an inch in length.” This
is the size of a single atom — certainly not
of a whole robot.
 The nanobots are too big to fit inside a
synapse and control human beings.
Synapses, junctions interconnecting the
neurons of the central nervous system, are
only a few atoms wide and these nanobots
are at least a hundred times bigger. This
claim ties in with the previous one —
nanobots “one ten-billionth of an inch in
length.” Although Crichton is consistent in
his size reference, nanobots composed of
only a few atoms wouldn’t have the compu-
tational power to do anything that the book
claims they can do.
These books may offer some benefit by gener-
ating interest in the subject and drawing people
into science. Unfortunately, they may also instill
some unnecessary fear and anxiety in our soci-
ety as new technologies emerge.

The nanotech industry
The National Science Foundation projects that nanotech will be a $1 trillion
industry by 2015 — that’s 10 percent of the current GDP of the United States.
Small wonder (so to speak) that the National Nanotechnology Initiative has
increased federal funding for nanotechnology research and development
from $464 million in 2001 to $982 million in 2005 (as shown in Figure 1-2).
Governments across the world poured $4 billion into nanotech research 
in 2004.
However, according to Lux Research Inc., only $13 billion worth of manufac-
tured goods will incorporate nanotechnologies this year. In the grand
scheme, that’s not very much. Nanotechnology, because of its complexity
and reach over different industries, will grow slowly over many decades.
Therefore, we must be patient and not expect a huge explosion of products
coming online all at once.

Part I: Getting Small with Nanotechnology 

Today, nanotech companies are either developing their knowledge base
through research or are producing the materials for other people’s nanotech
research. There are three entities from which nanotechnology will emerge:
open research (universities and national labs), large corporations, and start-
ups. These entities, in turn, have three options: They can produce their dis-
coveries, license them, or sell the rights to them outright. Licensing may be
an attractive option — it creates cash flow with minimal overhead.
Big companies will have some advantage here, given their resources and abil-
ity to purchase high-end measurement equipment. Some large industries,
such as pharmaceuticals and microchips, will be able to successfully inte-
grate nanotechnology because they already have the processes and facilities
in place to get their product to market — something small companies may
not have access to.
However, this shouldn’t discourage small companies who have the flexibility
to adapt. Small companies are set to develop products, processes, and intel-
lectual property, becoming attractive takeover candidates by big companies.
In the end, everyone wins — investors make money, small companies develop
products rapidly and efficiently, and big companies produce and distribute
the end product to the consumer.
Both large and small companies, given nanotech’s reach, will have to develop
partnerships and collaborations — not only between different industries but
also between different companies, universities, and government labs. Not only
will they exchange research but also resources. For example, Rice University
has a partnership with the Texas Medical Center, the largest medical center in
the world. Additionally, Rice (as well as other universities across the nation)
has broken down some financial barriers by developing the Shared Equipment
Authority (SEA), which will train and allow businesses to use million-dollar
measurement equipment for reasonable prices. If you want (for example) to
learn how to use a scanning electron microscope, it will cost you $200 to get
trained and $20/hour for each subsequent use. That’s incredibly cheap, con-
sidering that the equipment costs $500,000 to begin with, and more than
$40,000/year just to keep it maintained.
Battle of the bubbles: Nanotech 
versus Internet
Every industry has an economic bubble — speculation in a commodity that
causes the price to increase, which produces more speculation, which causes
the price to increase . . . until, at some point, the price reaches an absurd
level and the bubble bursts, causing a sudden — and precipitous — drop.
Bubbles aren’t good — they encourage people to misallocate resources in
ways that don’t pan out, with nonproductive results. Additionally, the crash
that follows can cause great economic problems. Of course, if you don’t get
23
Chapter 1: The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Nanotechnology

carried away, an economic bubble isn’t all bad — it allows money to flow into
a new industry to give it financial support to grow from. But too much blind
enthusiasm too soon can backfire as market forces weed out ventures that
don’t produce actual profits in a reasonable time.
Many industries have had bubbles — the railroad industry, the automobile
industry, even the tulip industry had an economic bubble. The most recent
example was the Internet bubble in the late 1990s. Alan Greenspan, chairman
of the Federal Reserve Board, identified this emerging bubble in 1996, calling
investor speculation “irrational exuberance,” which should have been
enough to warn off most folks — but fools and their money are soon parted.
So, is it foolish to invest now in nanotechnology? Not necessarily. We have no
doubt that there will be a “nanotechnology bubble” (within the next five years?),
but we hope it will prove to be more “exuberant” and less “irrational.” One thing
to keep in mind is that, with the dot-com bubble, companies were started for
$5,000 by lawyers and marketing agents who were pushing an idea — and not
necessarily a product. Nobody was quite sure what to do with the idea yet. The
essentials of the scientific knowledge base could be pretty well absorbed by
your average information-technology technician after only a few months of
training. Nanotechnology and nanoscience research, on the other hand, are a
much more complex kettle of fish. They require in-depth scientific knowledge
and a Ph.D.-level background. This knowledge base will be indispensable to any
nanotech start-up company, ensuring that the field will not be inundated by
every Tom, Dick, and Harry.
This requirement of high-level technical know-how is slowing nanotechnology’s
growth. There is a shortage of talent — a limited supply of scientists coming
up against increasing demand. Additionally, product-cycle times — the time
from research to market — is long. On the flipside, nanotech has fewer barri-
ers to market adoption than the Internet had. In order for online stores 
to be successful, customers had to own a computer, establish an Internet 
connection, and gain confidence in online transactions. Nanotechnology 
will already be integrated into existing products — no massive new-product-
adoption process will be required.
Nanotechnology’s biggest advantage over the Internet as The Next Big
(Little?) Thing will be its patentable intellectual property. Web-based innova-
tions were difficult to patent, allowing competitors to quickly adapt and clone
a product within months. Nanotechnology’s intellectual property creates a
major barrier to entry by being incredibly difficult to replicate. The time cost
to replicate is measured in years, encouraging the competitor to either take a
different approach or license the patent. This barrier to entry is fantastic for
small companies; they have more time to develop without getting immedi-
ately crushed by the big dogs.

Caveat Emptor — Buyer Beware
If recent history is any indication, our coming nanotech bubble may be over-
hyped and fueled with stock speculation. In this section, we hope to quell
some of this speculation early on and paint a realistic picture for you.
Currently, very few nanotech companies are public (that is, offering stock for
public purchase) — and the ones that are have a stock chart that reads more
like a cardiogram than a steady line of growth. That hasn’t deterred some
early players; on the Dow Jones Industrial Index, 19 of the 30 companies have
launched nano initiatives. This section takes a look at two particular compa-
nies and throws in some indexes you can follow as well.
Nanosys
In April 2004, Nanosys filed for a $115 million initial public offering (IPO) with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). They are a company rich in
patents — over 200 — but alas, no profits yet (sigh). This is not to say they
won’t ever make money — they are one of the companies that our research
shows has some great potential — and it’s a pretty sure bet they’ll license
their research.
For now, they’re cautious. In the Nanosys SEC filing, the company stated: “To
date, we have not successfully developed any commercially available prod-
ucts. . . . We do not anticipate that our first products will be commercially
available for at least several years, if at all.” (If at all? Not the rosiest picture.)
Nanosys even withdrew its filing in August 2004, stating “volatility of capital
25
Chapter 1: The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Nanotechnology
What’s in a name?
Nanosoft . . . Nanosonic . . . Nano Inside. These
are just a few words and phrases that folks have
tried to trademark with the United States Patent
and Trademark Office. Whether they’ll be suc-
cessful, we don’t know yet. “Nano” has recently
become the generic word for “high tech” — its
cachet is similar to what “virtual” and “holo” had
in the past few decades.
A few companies that already have “nano” in
their names do loosely develop some “nano”
products. U.S. Global Aerospace, for example,
which uses nanofiber technology in its cockpit
doors, recently changed its name to U.S. Global
Nanospace — that’s a drop of 14 orders of mag-
nitude! Nanogen makes micro arrays for genetic
research. Its NanoChip array has test sites 80
microns in size, spaced 200 microns apart — not
quite nano but headed in the right direction.
These quasi-legit nano-namings may have a
hidden bonus — they tend to make investors
leery, prompting them to scrutinize the claims
and dig deeper into a company’s nano-legiti-
macy. After all, we shouldn’t be able to “just add
nano” to sell a stock or company. But don’t be
surprised if some folks try that anyway.

markets.” But Nanosys has clout as one of the poster-child nanotech 
companies — and we give them credit for not starting a wild nanotech
bubble before the industry has had time to mature.
Altair Nanotechnologies, Inc.
On February 10, 2005, Altair Nanotechnologies, Inc. [NASDAQ: ALTI],
announced a breakthrough in their lithium-ion battery-electrode material.
This novel nanomaterial — composed of nano-size lithium-titanium-oxide 
particles — does the following for their rechargeable batteries:
 Delivers more power: You get three times the power of existing lithium-
ion batteries, to be exact.
 Allows faster recharge: Recharge takes a few minutes instead of hours.
 Ensures longer life: The material improves the number of recharge and
discharge cycles from a few hundred to many thousand cycles.
On this news, the stock spiked. Here’s what the results looked like:
 Day before: Closed at 2.08 with volume of 500k.
 Day of: Closed at 4.77 (129.3% increase) with volume of 56.6 million.
 Day after: Peaked at 6.52 (another 36.6% increase) with volume of 101.6
million.
Not bad for two days’ worth of work. As of mid-April, 2005, ALTI had a 50-day
moving average of 3.8 with an average volume close to 10 million. On April 19,
2005, they announced the initial shipment of their electrode nanomaterial for
testing at a partner company, Advanced Battery Technologies, Inc. This nano-
material will be incorporated into Advanced Battery’s Polymer-Lithium-Ion
(PLI) batteries tested in electric vehicles.
Investment tools and strategies
Whether or not Altair Nanotechnologies or Nanosys are going to be the next
eBay is certainly up in the air. Given the volatility of owning individual stocks
in nanotechnology, it’s wise to go with something a little more diverse, such
as an exchange-traded fund (ETF) or mutual fund. Unfortunately, there are no
nanotech ETFs or mutual funds at this time. Harris & Harris [NASDAQ: TINY]
is as close as you’re going to get for now; it’s a publicly traded venture-capital
firm specializing in nanotech companies.
Merrill Lynch established a “Nanotech Index” [Amex: NNZ] in 2004 — on
April Fools Day, of all days (those guys are such kidders). The index consists
of 22 small companies whose future business strategy is based on nanotech-
nology. Lux Research, Inc., is a research and advisory firm focusing on the
economic impact of nanotech businesses. Their index, Lux Nanotech Index
[Amex: LUXNI], follows 26 publicly traded nanotech companies. Merrill
Lynch’s Nanotech Index is open for trading, but Lux Nanotech Index is not.

As you conquer your greed and quell your fears (both wise moves), here are
a few generic tips to keep in mind. For further financial understanding,
there’s a copy of Investing For Dummies (authored by the inestimable Eric
Tyson and published by Wiley) with your name on it.
 Follow the money: There will undoubtedly be huge investments into
nanotech. Be mindful of large volume shifts, indicating large institution
investment.
 Follow the trend: 75 percent of all stocks follow the Dow Jones
Industrial Average — this will include nanotech stocks. If stocks are
going up, buy; if going down, sell. Buy low, sell high.

The world according to nano
Nanotechnology, given its scientific complexity,
is going to require a large amount of upfront
capital — and substantial government assis-
tance. In 2003, 52 percent of the $5.5 billion
invested in nanotechnology came from national
governments. The following table shows the

ogy investment.

This chart can be misleading — a wide gap in
financing does not necessarily result in a wide
gap in manpower. Although the United States
and Japan outspent China, engineers and scien-
tists in China make between one-sixth and one-
tenth of what Americans earn. The United States
spends five times as much as China but has less
than half as many researchers (1.3 million
Chinese versus 734,000 American). Additionally,
China’s universities and vocational schools pro-
duced 325,000 engineers this year — five times
as many as the United States.

 Don’t listen to tipsters: Tipsters will, more than likely, be wrong about a
lot of nanotech. We still need those scientists to help business analysts
make sense of what’s plausible and realistic. Do your own research;
don’t let a news sound bite influence your decision and control your
money.
 Set a stop loss: Set a sell-point with your brokerage firm; make it roughly 7
percent below your purchase price — and as the price goes up, increase
this stop-loss point. Doing so prevents what happened to many when they
rode the 1990s Internet crash into the ground.

 Tracing the path from nano-concept to nano-product
 Examining the hurdles that we face in making nanotechnology a reality
 Exploring ethical and societal challenges
I
f you read Chapter 1, you know that nanotechnology is the great hope of
the future, a better mousetrap, a Holy Grail of technology that could make
things stronger, people live longer, and stuff in general just great. That’s true,
to an extent. But before we delve deeper into the wonders of nanotechnology,
it’s only fair to look at the challenges that have to be met.
What challenges? First, it’s not a piece of cake getting from a nano-concept to a
viable nano-product in the marketplace. Second, there are ethical concerns —
just as there are with any new technology — that could pose barriers to nano-
progress. Finally, there is a global concern that we could create a nano-divide,
with rich nations benefiting from nano-progress and poorer nations lagging
behind.
Going from Lab to Factory to Home
Here’s something you can bank on: In the future, we are going to see numer-
ous new applications based (to some degree) on nanotechnological advances.
However, going from an idea to a laboratory to a product that appears in your
kitchen or bathroom can take years (or decades) and lots of work. Take a look
at what it took to transform a lab idea about a molecular-level product into
something called Kevlar.
What’s a Kevlar?
Kevlar was developed by DuPont back in the 1960s — a particularly turbulent
time in U.S. history. It turns out that DuPont had a track record in nylon and
other fibers that gave them an incentive to look for even better fibers. At

some point, they set a goal for themselves of creating a fiber with super-heat-
resistant properties (like asbestos, but without the health risks and lawsuits)
and with a stiffness almost like glass. Kevlar was the answer: It’s made up of
something called an aramid fiber, and it has about five times the strength of
steel. You might find Kevlar in products such as bulletproof vests, fire-blocking
fabrics, cables used in a whole bunch of applications, or even materials for
reinforcing tires or airplane fuselages.
When Kevlar was developed, in the pre-nanomania 1960s, there were a great
many hurdles DuPont had to jump — and it had to call on lots of disciplines
to get that job done. At times, current thinking had to be circumvented in
order to move forward. No surprise that an environment that encouraged
questions and challenges to the status quo was a key to the Kevlar success
story.
When you look at it phase by phase, this project is a great example of what it
means to bring molecular-level products from concept to market.
Phase One: Research
It was 1965. A research scientist at DuPont’s Pioneering Research Laboratory
named Stephanie Kwolek was hard at work trying to make a lightweight fiber
that was strong and could withstand high temperatures. She had discovered
that she could fit together certain molecules (namely, para-aminobenzoic
acid) into a long, chainlike molecule — a polymer. The problem was that the
thinking of the day denied that any opaque polymer solution (such as this
one) could be woven into fiber. Stephanie decided to keep going anyway. She
tried extruding the polymer through spinneret, a piece of equipment that
worked like a spider spinning silk, except in this case it took polymers in
solution and spun them into fiber.
30
Part I: Getting Small with Nanotechnology 
But is it nano?
Kevlar was developed over 40 years ago. It’s not
often referred to as a nano-discovery, because
few people spoke about nano then. When this
work was done it was called polymer chemistry,
even though it used nano-size materials.
Even today, you have to remember that nano-
technology is merely the application of any-
thing on a molecular level, in any field. One
researcher may refer to a work in progress as a
chemistry or physics project; another may refer
to the same endeavor as nanotechnology. Some
people hold that 10 or 20 years from now there
will be no nanotechnology per se, just the use
of nano-size materials in a variety of disciplines.
It’s sort of like the way people use colorings in
lots of things: foods, clothing, car paint, and so
on. There’s not exactly a field of colorings, just
the use of them in a variety of industries.

To everybody’s surprise, the opaque polymer spun quite well, and made a kind
of super-fiber. In fact, its stress-strain curve — a standard measurement of fiber
strength — was startling, so startling that the lab had to test the results over
and over before anybody believed what they were seeing. Almost as an added
bonus, the heat resistance was just what they were looking for.
The bad news was that the raw material was very expensive. To find a cheaper
alternative, a huge program was launched to try to understand the physical
chemistry of this type of polymer. In the process, they found something called
PPD-T, a suitably similar type of polymer made from lower-priced ingredients.
But that wasn’t the end of their problems. It turned out that in order to put
the cheaper polymer through the spinneret, they had to dissolve it in sulfuric
acid, something that tends to burn a hole through people. In addition, the sul-
furic acid mixed with the polymer was so thick (viscous to all you chemist
types out there) that it wasn’t practical to get the spinneret up to the
required speed to get it to spin into fiber.
The researchers weren’t about to give up, so they went to the manufacturing-
and-engineering groups. These farsighted engineers essentially told them to go
jump in the nearest lake. The spinning solvent, they said, was too out-there —
and really corrosive to boot. The yields were very low, and the investment 
was high. Luckily, researchers on the threshold of a discovery aren’t easily 
dissuaded, so they ignored the engineers.
Folks around the lab felt that a concentration of polymer greater than 10 per-
cent would be too thick. But one bright researcher tried a 20 percent mixture
at a high temperature. To everyone’s surprise, it worked — and allowed the
materials to be spun at much higher concentrations, making the process 
economically feasible.
A second important discovery involved the way in which the fiber is quenched
with water to cool it as it comes out of a spinneret. This alert researcher real-
ized that if they added an air gap between the spinneret and the water, stress
on the fiber caused the polymers coming out to align in the same direction.
When the fibers cooled down, they froze with that same alignment, resulting
in a much stronger fiber.
This was a horse of a different color: PPD-T now deserved some corporate
attention. The product was unusual, the process used to produce it looked
scaleable, and the dollars and cents made sense. The manufacturing engi-
neers admitted the value, accepted the risks of building a plant using hot 
sulfuric acid as a spin solvent, and jumped on board.
31
Chapter 2: Nano in Your Life 

Things heat up
Now they were up against it: They had to actually make this thing work in a
manufacturing environment. This is the part that gives researchers and engi-
neers nightmares.
Dozens of people from all walks of (scientific and engineering) life were gath-
ered together in the great state of Virginia. Unbeknownst to them, the serious
hurdles were just beginning.
First, how would they dispose of the sulfuric acid after the fiber-spinning
process? After many late-night pizzas, they decided to convert it into calcium
sulfate (commonly known as gypsum — the stuff used in wallboard and
cement manufacture).
The second hurdle involved concerns about one of the chemicals used to
polymerize the PPT-D. Though it had not been found to be toxic in previous
studies, they took the time to run some further studies. One study with some
hapless rats showed that the chemical could indeed be carcinogenic (cancer-
causing) in animals. DuPont took immediate steps to change the handling
methods of the chemical so that no one working with it — or the community
at large, or the customers — would be put at risk.
DuPont also started a search for an alternative chemical with low toxicity
that could produce the same properties in the fiber. They found one in rela-
tively short order, but it caused another problem.
Turns out that when you use the alternative chemical with lower toxicity, 
it produces not only the correct long polymer chains, but also some short
polymer chains that have to be weeded out. The engineers had to get together
over coffee and donuts to modify the process to get rid of these tiny polymers.
To market, to market . . .
Anybody who has ever brought a product to market knows that R&D and
engineering are easy compared to figuring out whether anybody will actually
buy the thing (a factor called market potential). The final step in the process
of bringing Kevlar to light was building a full-scale plant — to the tune of $400
million. As the building progressed, people were desperately seeking practi-
cal applications for the fiber.
At the time, Fortune magazine called Kevlar “a miracle in search of a market.”
DuPont entered into lots of partnerships with potential customers to see
what people actually needed from fabrics.
32
Part I: Getting Small with Nanotechnology 

The first area of commercialization focus involved steel-wire ropes used under-
water with pulleys in offshore oil drilling. Kevlar has a strength 20 times higher
than steel in sea water. Everybody thought Kevlar ropes should be lighter and
easier to handle and have a longer lifetime than steel. Surprise! Kevlar rope life-
times ended up being only about 5 to 10 percent more than steel rope — not
the major selling point everyone had expected!
People scurried to find a way to improve the rope. One thing they tried was
to make the ropes out of three different diameters of fiber. This compacted
the structure and spread out the load; the resulting rope lasted five times as
long.
Another change involved lubrication of the strands. DuPont surrounded each
cable in a braid impregnated with fluorocarbons. This did a lot to reduce fric-
tion, heat, and abrasion. The lifetime of the cable now got better by a factor
of six.
The final challenge was to optimize the angle at which they twisted the fibers
to form the rope. This provided additional improvements in the life of the
rope — and led to the use of Kevlar for many more types of rope applica-
tions. And that was only the beginning.
Kevlar’s birth gives a good example of the kinds of problems anybody work-
ing with new science and commercial realities has to face. But to give those
budding scientists among you hope, after all the hardships, Stephanie Kwolek
was inducted into the U.S. Inventor’s Hall of Fame in 1995.
Jumping Over the Hurdles
Though nanotechnology holds great promise in many areas, fulfilling that
promise could come at a price. Companies looking to bring nanotechnology-
based products to market will face various hurdles.
The availability or cost of equipment used to monitor the quality of the prod-
uct could be a problem. The smaller the product being worked on, the more
sophisticated and expensive the equipment needed to monitor quality con-
trol. For example, you might need a pricey electron microscope to measure
size variations in a product.
The equipment needed for producing nanomaterials may not be readily avail-
able — or could cost a bundle. Equipment that can perform operations small
enough to make some products may not even exist yet, which could delay
projects. (Details, details.)
33
Chapter 2: Nano in Your Life 

We talk in more detail about microscopes used to monitor nanomaterials and
nanomanipulators in Chapter 3 — and take a look at equipment used in the
manufacture of computer chips in Chapter 6.
Then there are the regulatory hurdles: Evaluations and government
approvals are needed to bring products such as a new drug to market. All
that hoop-jumping could take a long — and we mean long — time.
The scarceness or cost of nano-scale raw materials (such as buckyballs) could
limit what products are manufactured and when. Take a look at Chapter 4 to
explore some of the nanomaterials that are used (or are expected to be used)
in products — and the ongoing efforts to improve their availability.
We’ll have to develop procedures to mass-produce products developed in
labs. The factors affecting the development of the manufacturing process
might include
 The safety factor: Making sure the chemicals used are safe in a manufac-
turing environment and meet all government regulations.
 The awful-glop factor: Having an environmentally safe way to dispose of
or recycle used chemicals.
 The heavy-duty factor: Producing production and monitoring equip-
ment able to withstand the rigors of full-time use with reasonable main-
tenance requirements. There can be a significant difference between the
performance of a single piece of equipment that is pampered in the lab
by doting scientists and a bank of the same machines run by operators
on a production line.
 The uniformity factor: Developing a production process that minimizes
variation during mass production so that enough of the products pro-
duced meet specifications. This goes hand in hand with the need to
design the product so it functions the way it’s supposed to, even with a
typical level of variation found in the production process.
 The quality-control factor: Finding a way to test or screen out unaccept-
able products.
 The expertise factor: Locating enough human resources (for example,
suitably equipped engineers and scientists) to troubleshoot the process
when, inevitably, issues show up in mass production that never
appeared in the lab. (This is in accordance with the rule that a problem
with your car never happens when you show it to the mechanic.)
Looking at Ethics and Society
Not all challenges with nanotechnology are technical; sometimes the 
human challenges are at least as tough. For example, the development 
34
Part I: Getting Small with Nanotechnology 

of nanotechnology entails two major ethical issues that we’ll all have to grap-
ple with at some point. The first is the possibility that nanomaterials could
cause harm, either to the environment or to human beings. The second
relates to the way in which nano-benefits will be divided among the nations
of the world.
Possible harm from nanomaterials
We’ve seen the scenario in a slew of science fiction movies — whenever a sci-
entist discovers something new, some hideous green monster forms out of the
goop and attacks its creator. Nanotechnology may not suffer the same fate as
Baron von Frankenstein, but it is playing around with some things we’ve never
played with before, and that concerns some people.
Over the last ten years or so, work with nanomaterials has moved along
smartly — and by now we’re using them in a whole bunch of products such as
semiconductor chips and drugs. Tests for toxicity that might result from using
these materials have been much slower to appear. Still, some experiments have
shown there is cause for concern — and several groups are expressing concern
because hundreds of products using nanomaterials are already on the market
and more are on the way. Nanotechnology is likely to become a trillion-dollar
industry in less than ten years. With that kind of explosive growth, some kind
of watchdogging is indicated.
In the wake of cautions about (for example) genetically modified crops, gov-
ernments and corporations are paying closer attention to how nanomaterials
affect the environment, humans, and animals. The U.K. Royal Society, that
venerable scientific institution, has commissioned a study of the potential
risks and benefits of nanomaterials. The U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency, not to be outdone, has also funded studies into potential health and
environmental effects of nanomaterials, as well as studies to evaluate the use
of nanomaterials to clean up the environment. For more about these studies,
visit the EPA’s Nanotechnology Web site (http://es.epa.gov/ncer/nano/).
Here are some findings about nano that are causing a stir:
 DuPont has determined that Single-Walled Nanotubes (SWNTs) can cause
lesions in the lungs of rats. In one study, 15 percent died from suffocation
when clumps of nanotubes lodged in their lungs. The study indicates that
size matters; nanoparticles are generally more toxic when inhaled than
are larger particles of the same material.
 Because of the small size of nano materials, people have looked at the
possibility that they could interact with living cells in ways we can’t
anticipate. Researchers at Southern Methodist University in Dallas have
found that buckyballs can, in fact, disrupt the membranes of fish brain
cells. Trying to establish whether the same thing could happen to
people, a team at Rice University exposed human liver and skin cells
35
Chapter 2: Nano in Your Life 

(grown in the lab) to solutions containing buckyballs. They found that a
diluted solution (20 parts per billion) was capable of killing half the
cells. At this point, neither experiment has been truly conclusive, which
means more research needs to be done.
The good news is that researchers have found that by bonding simple chemi-
cals to carbon spheres, they could reduce toxicity. This finding could be help-
ful in enabling nano participation in drug delivery. However, ultraviolet light
from the sun might reduce the effect, rendering the spheres toxic again.
Because of such findings, the Action Group on Erosion, Technology, and
Concentration (ETC Group) is actively lobbying for a nanotechnology research
moratorium — a halt to all research until all hazards are investigated. Rice
University’s Center for Biological and Environmental Nanotechnology has taken
a different approach, launching the International Council on Nanotechnology
(ICON) to encourage collaboration among academic, industry, regulatory, and
nongovernmental interest groups to assess, communicate, and reduce potential
environmental and health risks associated with nanotechnology. ICON is work-
ing in four areas, including social-science research and public communication
about nanotechnology. Their members include, among others, DuPont, Procter
and Gamble, L’Oreal, and Intel. Interestingly, when the group was formed, three
environmental groups refused to become members, fearing corporate domina-
tion of the process.
A new field, nanoecology, is emerging to study the interface between molecu-
lar technologies and our natural environment
Encountering a Nano Divide?
No technology exists in an economic vacuum; nano is no exception. Its devel-
opment requires high levels of investment and an already-advanced technol-
ogy. What happens to countries that don’t have those? Well, the development
of HIV/AIDS drugs may offer a sobering example: When the rich countries of
the world developed them, the poorer countries — whose need became even
greater — couldn’t possibly afford to buy them. Many people are worried
about a similar divide occurring when the wealthier countries that are pio-
neering nanotechnology research file all the patents and reap all the rewards.
Countries with less-educated workforces won’t be able to compete in the nano-
technology-related future. Benefits in medicine and other areas may “follow
the money” and not be shared equally.
Who gets to benefit?
The issue is at least under discussion. The Rockefeller Foundation, for exam-
ple, co-sponsored a conference entitled Global Dialogue on Nanotechnology
and the Poor. Leaders who attended expressed concern about access to revo-
lutionary technological discoveries, and many spoke of the need to ensure
that such discoveries benefit the poor as well as the rich.
36
Part I: Getting Small with Nanotechnology 

The debate often gathers around the expectation that benefits of nanotech-
nology could directly address the woes of third-world countries — these, for
example:
 Potential uses of nanotechnology to detect AIDS and cancer:
Promising — but who will share in that benefit? Similar tests for 
TB and malaria, both much more prevalent in developing countries, 
could end up being unavailable where they are needed most.
 TB diagnostic kits using nanotechnology: These could reduce the time
and cost of tests and save lives. The size of these devices could make
them ideal for carrying into remote regions.
 Vaccinations for children: Advanced nano-medicine could save many
lives as nanoparticles deliver medicines more effectively.
 Nano-repair of damaged bones: Potentially a boon in developing coun-
tries where traffic accidents have been called an “unseen epidemic.”
 Enzyme biosensors: These could be useful in monitoring toxicity in soil
and crops. This could improve agricultural quality control.
 Environmental cleanup: Nanomagnets might be used to suck up oil in
large-scale oil spills.
 Lower-cost energy: The use of nano-based solar cells could power rural
areas without having to build an extensive power grid.
 Improving the water supply: Nanoparticles could help to filter and
clean polluted water.
Making the numbers work
In addition to the technical side, economic concerns crop up: Industrialized
nations will certainly be the first to benefit, but as mass production takes hold,
technology could trickle down to developing nations. Still, many people worry
about who will control the means of production of many of these beneficial
products. Who will be in charge — corporations or specific governments with
37
Chapter 2: Nano in Your Life 
Parallels to pharmaceuticals?
When do intellectual property squabbles give
way to the demand to humanely meet people’s
needs? The pharmaceutical industry is cur-
rently battling this very question. It takes U.S.
companies at least 12 years to get a drug devel-
oped and approved, but by year 20, the patent
expires and generic drug makers cut into the
original drug maker’s profits. These profits are
needed to recover costs of research, develop-
ment, and testing, and to do further research for
drugs to fight other diseases. On the other hand,
the generic drug makers lower the price con-
siderably, making the drug available to a wider
audience. The early players in nanotechnology
will unquestionably face some of the same
tricky dilemmas.

more military power? Will developing countries have the resources to set up,
monitor, and enforce safety regulations related to nanotechnology? Will richer
countries invest their dollars in (for example) nano-based stain-resistant jeans,
age-defying nano-cosmetics, and other “frivolous” products, ignoring the
research into potentially life-saving materials that third-world countries are lit-
erally dying for?
There is also concern that advances in nanotechnology will undermine cer-
tain industries that support the economies of developing countries, such as
the extraction of natural resources. For this reason, many are calling for rich
nations to devote a certain amount of the investment dollars that go to over-
seas countries to nanotechnology research in developing countries.
Nano and the economy
The government committee that had the privilege of wading into the contro-
versy associated with putting genetically engineered foods on the supermar-
ket shelves of England is facing another heated public debate about nano-
foods. The Action Group on Erosion, Technology, and Concentration (the
same ETC Group we mention earlier in this chapter) is concerned not only
that the potential harm of nano-foods and pesticides is unknown, but also
that nanotechnology will have an adverse impact on farmers in poor countries.
Others worry about shifts in the supply and value chains in the world econ-
omy. Small farmers in developing countries will be among the first affected.
For example, products such as rubber and cotton (produced primarily in
poor countries) could be largely replaced by nano-based materials.
Whatever the outcome of the debate, there are real ethical and social ques-
tions that a revolutionary field such as nanotechnology poses that will have
to be addressed on a global level.

t’s only by visualizing the basic structure of matter that you can get a good
working sense of what’s going on in the nano-world described in the rest of
this book. So get ready for a field trip to the nano construction site for a look
at how molecules are formed from atoms, how light interacts with matter, and
what tools scientists use to study and manipulate things about the size of
(naturally) a nanometer.
Consider this the chapter where you get some up-to-date science basics
under your belt. If you’re a whiz in chemistry and physics, skip ahead to 
the section “Analyzing the Composition of Objects with Spectroscopy,” 
but for those of you whose science is a tad rusty, read on.
That Bit of Chemistry and Physics 
You Just Have to Know
Nanotechnology presents you with a world that’s normally outside everyday
practical experience. Before you take your first (ahem) tiny steps into the
world of nano-size objects, it’s a good idea to dig out your old physics and
chemistry notes from high school and/or college. If you don’t have those
notes handy (the dog ate them, or you steered clear of chemistry and physics
in school), don’t worry: We provide the basics right here. First we cover the
building blocks of matter, atoms, and molecules, and explain how they stick
together. Then we offer enlightening remarks on light — the dominant way
most of us perceive things around us — including how researchers can see
tiny nanoparticles by using super-duper microscopes (that’s a technical term).

Molecular building blocks
One basic that even Einstein started with is that our physical universe is
made up of matter and energy. At its root, chemistry is primarily concerned
with describing the physical matter in that universe. Chemistry asks ques-
tions like these:
 What is matter composed of?
 How will a substance behave under certain conditions?
 What combinations of substances and conditions allow us to make other
substances?
Physics, on the other hand, has its own set of questions to deal with.
Physicists spend their time studying the forces that range from those holding
each individual atom together to forces that hold the entire universe together
by binding matter and energy.
A basic grasp of both physics and chemistry is essential equipment if you
really want to understand our universe on a tiny scale. To make yourself at
home in this nano-realm, for example, you need to understand what matter 
is composed of.
Start with a basic building block of nature — atoms.
Looking at the atom from the inside out
To get the hang of how nature uses atoms as building blocks requires a basic
understanding of how they’re structured. Here’s the anatomy of an atom:
 Atoms are composed of even smaller particles; the three main types of
these subatomic particles are protons, neutrons, and electrons.
 Protons and neutrons cluster together in the center of the atom — its
nucleus. Protons are positively charged; neutrons are neutral.
 Orbiting around the nucleus — in much the same way the moon orbits
around the earth — are smaller, negatively charged particles known as
electrons.
Putting these pieces together, you get an image like that shown in Figure 3-1 —
the classic symbol of all things “atomic.” Note that the size of the nucleus in
relation to the atom is seriously exaggerated in this figure: If an atom was the
size of the earth, the nucleus would only be the size of a bowling ball!
40
Part I: Getting Small with Nanotechnology 

May the force(s) be with you
An attracting force known as the strong nuclear force holds protons and neu-
trons together in the nucleus of an atom. Despite its name, the strong nuclear
force has nothing to do with The Force in Star Wars — in fact, it plays only a
minor role in determining the actual structure of an atom. This rather muscle-
bound force has only a limited range — it’s very strong over very short dis-
tances (such as 10-15 m), but it disappears quickly at a range much beyond
that. (It’s nearly nonexistent outside the nucleus.)
From the atom’s point of view, the more important force — the one that really
gives the atom its form — is the electromagnetic or electrostatic force that acts
between charged particles — you know, like those protons and electrons we
just told you about. As you might expect, this force is greater at close range.
The nearer two particles are, the more they feel it — and it gets weaker as
they get farther away from each other.
Forces, like people, can be either attractive or repulsive, depending on the 
situation. When you have two particles with opposite charges — the positive
proton and the negative electron, for example — the electrostatic force is
attractive and the particles are drawn toward each other (it’s one realm where
opposites do attract). If, on the other hand, two particles have similar charges
(for example, two electrons), the force is repulsive and the particles tend to
move away from each other.

Chapter 3: Gathering the Tools of the Trade 

You can visualize the effect of these forces by remembering that time you
spent in elementary school messing around with magnets. You tried to get
the north poles of two bar magnets to touch each other and you marveled 
at feeling an invisible repulsive force hell-bent on pushing them apart. (The
coolest part was when you released your grip on the two bar magnets and
they skittered away from each other as if possessed.) When you turned one
bar magnet around so the north pole of one bar magnet faced the south pole
of the other, it was all you could do to keep the magnets from flying out of
your hands in their rush to stick together.
Charged particles behave much like those magnets.
Holding atoms together
Practically speaking, how does an electrostatic force give an atom its shape
and dimension? It’s a kind of balancing act that works like this:
 The attractive force between electrons and protons pulls the electrons
closer as they zip around the nucleus. This force prevents electrons
from escaping from the atom.
 The repulsive force between the electrons themselves prevents them from
hurtling toward the nucleus. That’s because, as electrons move toward
the nucleus, the volume the electrons occupy becomes smaller — and the
distance between them shrinks until they remember that they can’t stand
each other.
 When electrons move closer together, the repulsive force gets stronger,
forcing the electrons to move away from each other or stay as far away
as they can get.
Ultimately the size of an atom is the result of two forces: the attraction of 
the nucleus for the electrons and the repulsive force between electrons.
Bonding atoms with electrons
Nature uses building blocks of many different sizes — not only atoms them-
selves but also stuck-together clumps of atoms (molecules). Just as something
has to keep each atom in one piece, something else must hold the atoms
together — just as mortar holds bricks together. In this case, that mortar is a
relationship between atoms: chemical bonds.
Chemical bonding occurs when there aren’t enough electrons to go around 
in the immediate vicinity, so the atoms get together and share electrons. 
This sharing allows each atom to reach a more stable state (which atoms 
like, being relatively lazy). An atom’s outermost electrons are available for
chemical bonding; they’re the least strongly attached to their atom, so
they’re the only electrons that can be shared.
42
Part I: Getting Small with Nanotechnology 

Each type of atom — hydrogen and helium, for example — has a different
number of electrons available for chemical bonding and they are therefore
more or less stable. That’s why when you’re around hydrogen you have to be
careful not to burn things up, whereas you can safely use helium in a kid’s
birthday balloons. Because of the number of electrons it contains, helium is
much more stable than hydrogen, so it disdains chemical reactions such as
burning. (It’s also great for situations when you just have to talk like a
Munchkin.)
Moving on up to molecules
Some atoms have all the electrons they need, thank you very much, and
prefer not to bond. They are the most chemically stable groups of atoms, the
noble gases (such as neon and argon) — so stable they never feel the need to
share electrons with other atoms.
Other types of atoms have to pool their electron resources to get greater stabil-
ity, so they join together to form larger structures — molecules. For example,
an oxygen molecule — which, unless you’re an alien life form, you’re breathing
right this second — is just two oxygen atoms joined by a chemical bond; shar-
ing electrons makes each oxygen atom more stable. Methane (which you want
to avoid breathing at all costs) is one carbon atom joined with four hydrogen
atoms by a chemical bond — sharing electrons makes all the atoms involved
(both carbon and hydrogen) more stable.
When atoms join together via chemical bonds, you get the most stable mol-
ecules when each atom has as many electrons whizzing around it (counting
the shared ones), as you’d find in a noble gas. In effect, every atom aspires to
be as “noble” as possible but has to share. Result: molecules.
Molecules can range in size and complexity from a few atoms to many thou-
sands of atoms. For example, a simple polymer (which you’ll hear more
about in subsequent chapters) is a long chain of several thousand methane
molecules joined by chemical bonds between the carbon atoms, with two
hydrogen atoms (rather than methane’s standard four) per carbon atom.
Put enough molecules together, you get materials
Eventually, collections of molecules bond together to become things we 
use every day (like plastic and chocolate). But what determines these larger
structures of molecules? Well, for openers, the same force that keeps an elec-
tron in an atom also sticks molecules together — the electrostatic force.
The strength of that intermolecular bond (which also qualifies as an attrac-
tion or a force) depends on how the electrons in the molecules are arranged.
As the molecules get together, the intermolecular bond is a major factor in
determining what kind of material is formed. Strong intermolecular bonds
might give you a liquid at room temperature — weak intermolecular bonds
might give you gas. (So to speak.)
43
Chapter 3: Gathering the Tools of the Trade 

Need a few classic illustrations of how intermolecular bonds affect a mater-
ial’s properties? (Doesn’t everybody?) Try these on for size . . .
Somebody get a mop
In water molecules — each made up of one oxygen atom and two hydrogen
atoms — the negatively charged electrons huddle near the oxygen atom,
away from the hydrogen atoms. That gives the oxygen side of the molecule a
negative charge and the side with the hydrogen atoms a positive charge. The
result is a polar molecule (one side has a stronger positive charge and the
other side has a stronger negative charge). The intermolecular bond between
water molecules is strong enough to make a liquid at room temperature; it
happens because the hydrogen atoms in one water molecule are drawn to the
oxygen atom in another water molecule. In the nano-realm, it’s all about elec-
trostatic attraction between molecules; in the larger everyday world, things
are just wet.
Oxygen — it’s a gas!
Oxygen is breathable at room temperature because its intermolecular bond is
feeble. Each oxygen molecule contains two oxygen atoms, with the electrons

Part I: Getting Small with Nanotechnology 
Impurities can be useful, Mr. Bond
Consider the humble plastic-wrapped electrical
wire: In the everyday world, it’s common knowl-
edge that the metal wire acts as a conductor
and the plastic coating acts as an insulator. On
the nano level, what’s going on is a difference
in methods of chemical bonding. The metallic
bonding between the metal atoms allows the
electrons shared between atoms to move from
atom to atom — when these delocalized elec-
trons are present, electricity flows. On the other
hand, the covalent bonding between the plastic
atoms forbids the shared electrons to move
around. No delocalized electrons allowed; the
plastic stops electricity in its tracks, keeping the
zap in the wire where it belongs.
This relationship gets hazy when you tamper with
the chemical bonds by adding impurities. For
example, materials that are semiconductors
(such as silicon) have electrical properties some-
where between conductors and insulators —
and can act either way, depending on the situa-
tion. When silicon is pure, it acts like an insulator;
when it’s not pure, it conducts different amounts
of electricity, depending on how much of what
stuff you add to it (a process called doping).
Introducing different impurities creates different
types of semiconductors. Down there in the nano
realm, a negotiation among chemical bonds
determines how freely the electrons can move.
When specific impurities — say, arsenic and
boron — are added to semiconductors, they get
silicon to act as a conductor, each in a different
way: Adding arsenic (which contributes those
footloose delocalized electrons) creates an 
“n-type” semiconductor; adding boron instead
creates a “p-type.” P-type semiconductors
have no delocalized electrons; instead, they
have “holes” — places where electrons should
be, but aren’t. Then current can flow because
the electrons move from one hole to another.

evenly distributed between them — symmetrically, in a nonpolar molecule.
(Not quite a noble gas, but it does put on some airs.) If you distribute the posi-
tive and negative particles evenly, you get a puny electrostatic attraction —
much weaker than for water — so not much intermolecular bond. No wonder
the molecules bounce around the room.
The intermolecular bond between nonpolar molecules (the sort you find in
oxygen) is called the van der Waals force. It’s puny — totally dependent on
the constant movement of electrons within molecules — which causes elec-
trostatic attraction only part of the time. When the electrons move again, the
attraction disappears. So, even though the van der Waals force is the same
type of attractive force that occurs between polar molecules, it’s only a part-
time force — so the total attraction is much lower.
Beyond bonding, there’s molecular structure
The type of bonding that goes on between molecules causes materials to
have certain properties (such as conductivity). In addition, the way atoms
and molecules fit together can affect a material’s properties.
For example, graphite, which is used in lubricants and in pencil leads, is
essentially sheets of carbon atoms bonded together into one huge molecule,
with hydrogen atoms hanging on only at the edges. Because the only bonding
between sheets is the van der Waals’ force, the sheets slide easily over each
other. Drag the graphite across paper, and it leaves a trail of itself on the page.
It just so happens that diamonds also contain carbon atoms — in fact, that’s
all a diamond contains — stacked neatly in a three-dimensional array or lat-
tice. This three-dimensional structure has bonds from each atom to all the
atoms immediately surrounding it — which makes the entire diamond one
molecule with a 3-D structure. (Yep, one month’s salary buys you one mole-
cule — okay, a gigantic one — for your engagement ring.) One other result is
some serious stability, which gives each diamond its strength. Figure 3-2
shows the structures of both diamonds and graphite.
The everyday world seems pretty solid to us, but deep in the nano-realm,
matter is formed out of dynamic relationships and compromises — and 
now we can affect the outcome directly. You can see why nanotechnology
researchers get excited about the ability to manipulate things at the atomic
and molecular level. For example, you can customize substances. Imagine a
future nanotechnology that starts out with just carbon atoms and ends up
with superstrong, diamondlike, lightweight structural members for airplanes
or spacecraft. It’s closer than you might think.

Chapter 3: Gathering the Tools of the Trade 

Turning on the light
Whenever you look at anything, from this book in your hands to a mountain
range in the distance, you are essentially seeing light. Some things in nature
produce light — such as the sun and lightning bugs — but only when (respec-
tively) you’re on the dayside of the planet or the bugs are looking for mates.
After a few thousand years, people got pretty sick of sitting in the dark half
the time, so they set about inventing their own devices to produce light —
fire, light bulbs, glow-in-the-dark decals, the usual stuff that works pretty well
in the everyday world.
The better we get at creating light, the more theories scientific types come 
up with to explain how light is generated, how it travels, and how it behaves.
A quick rundown of the current best and brightest notions will shed light
(sorry) on the last two sections of this chapter — the ones that deal with
spectroscopy and microscopy, two of the most important tools used in 
nanotechnology research.

Thinking about light
For a long time, people thought of light as being made up of itsy-bitsy parti-
cles, too small for anybody to see. Isaac Newton — a pretty smart guy, if truth
be told — was one of the champions of particle theory (which stated that light
is essentially a stream of such particles).
Some physicists disagreed with the particle theory, maintaining that light
acted like (and so was composed of) waves. In the 1800s, in fact, some
researchers showed conclusively that light had properties that could only be
explained if it were made up of waves. This wave theory stated that light had
properties similar to a wavelike electric field traveling with a wavelike mag-
netic field. In light of this theory (sorry), light took its place in a spectrum of
electromagnetic radiation that would eventually include heat waves, X-rays,
and radio waves.
Along came Albert Einstein about a hundred years ago (in the early 1900s)
with a revolutionary bright idea about the photoelectric effect, the tendency 
of some metals to give off electrons when struck with ultraviolet light. This
effect is evidence that you can transfer energy into something by shining
light on it.
At the time, wave theory couldn’t account for all the details of this effect.
Wave theory suggested that the photoelectric effect should cut off when the
light you are shining on the metal falls below a certain intensity. (Intensity
here is simply the amount of light present.) Instead, it was determined that
decreasing frequency of the light (a measurement related to the amount of
energy in a light wave) caused the cutoff, rather than intensity.
According to Albert, you can think of light as being made of little energy 
packets called photons. Using photons (which act like particles), you can
explain how the photoelectric effect works. Light comes in different frequen-
cies. Each photon contains a certain amount of energy related to the frequency
of the light in it. An ultraviolet light is high frequency and high energy, while an
infrared light is lower frequency and lower energy. If a photon has high enough
energy (as with ultraviolet light), it can kick an electron loose from the metal
and cause the current generated in the photoelectric effect. As light frequency
goes down, the energy of the photons goes down and the current cuts off.
Today’s physicists banter about both particle and wave theory when talking
about light and generally believe that light can behave in both ways — as a
particle and a wave — it depends on the situation. To describe light traveling
from one place to another, we call on ideas from the wave model. When you
talk about light interacting with matter on the atomic level, Albert’s photons
come into play — and into nano-research.
47
Chapter 3: Gathering the Tools of the Trade 

What exactly are light waves?
Consider, for a moment, a wave at the seashore. That wave occurs because
energy is traveling through the water. The water on one side of an ocean
doesn’t move from one side to the other; instead, it’s energy that moves
across the ocean through the water. Light, in all its forms, is energy; it travels
in waves.
Light waves don’t even have to travel “through” anything; they are quite
happy to travel through a vacuum. That’s because light waves are made 
up of electric and magnetic fields — and those are energy, not matter.
Folks with nothing better to do measure the wavelength of light — the distance
between one wave peak and the next (see Figure 3-3): The shorter the wave-
length, the higher the energy; think about cooking things with microwaves —
the micro means a really short wavelength. Way down at a tiny wavelength of 1
billionth of a meter, light waves are actually invisible, and referred to as gamma
waves — a dangerous part of atomic radiation because of its high penetrating
power. Up at the centimeter (or even meter) wavelength, you run into things
like radio waves — still invisible but useful for broadcasting. What we can see
with our eyes are wavelengths in the 400 to 700 billionths-of-a-meter range —
just one small piece of the total spectrum of light.
Clocking light frequency
If you consider sound as a wave, then the vibration of the air is evidence of
its passing by. If you measure how many waves go by in a second, you know
(well, yeah) how frequently a wave goes by — so the name for this number is
frequency. The unit of measurement that expresses frequency is Hertz (Hz),
which means cycles (movement from one wave crest to the next) per second.
Knowing how many crests are going by every second tells you how fast the
light wave is moving.
Light you can see — called (well, yeah) visible light — is also called color
because that’s how we see it — in different colors at different frequencies.
You see red at 430 trillion Hz and things look violet at 750 trillion Hz — and
those extreme numbers are the two ends of the visible spectrum. When light

goes above the top of the visible spectrum, it’s ultraviolet (beyond violet);
when it goes below the threshold of vision, it’s infrared (below red) — either
way, it’s outta sight.
High-frequency light has a high level of energy; low-frequency light has a lower
level of energy. To use the water analogy, the wavelength of light tells you how
stretched-out or scrunched-up the individual waves are; the frequency tells
you how often they hit. If the waves are all the same size, there’s more energy
delivered when more of them pound the shore (higher frequency).
But light doesn’t just sit around; it also gets out and travels at various speeds.
Light is generally a pretty fast little guy, traveling at a maximum speed of
186,000 miles per second (traffic cops be warned!) when racing through a
vacuum — at its top speed, light is the fastest thing we know. When light trav-
els through substances, however — even those we call transparent — it slows
down. So light moving through water, a diamond, or even air moves more
slowly than it does in the vacuum of space. The effect of different substances
on light’s speed can cause the beam of light waves to bend, which is called
refraction. Light at different frequencies bends at different angles, which is
what allows a prism to separate colors.
The whole continuum (that is, range) of light size, frequency, and energy is
called the electromagnetic spectrum (illustrated in Figure 3-4). Visible light is
only a very tiny part of that spectrum — about one-thousandth of 1 percent.
Kicking out a photon
Watching light at play in the everyday world is pretty easy to get your mind
around — but at the nano level, if you want to grapple with how light is gen-
erated or absorbed by atoms, you’re better off thinking of light as a stream 
of photons. Every day your world is crisscrossed with zillions of photons
coming from light sources such as lamps or the sun, reflected off of the
things around you. Eyes absorb photons bouncing off the objects, triggering
a nerve impulse to the brain, which registers the objects as “seen.”

Chapter 3: Gathering the Tools of the Trade 

One way to produce a photon is to energize the electrons moving around an
atomic nucleus — then something’s got to give, and the atom gives off a
photon to get back to its former peaceful condition. Now, normally the elec-
trons that move around the nucleus are placed in the orbital (path around the
nucleus) that requires the least amount of energy from them. But if you add
energy to an atom, the electrons can move up to an orbital that takes more
energy to maintain. But most matter is basically lazy; the electrons yearn for
their cozy old orbitals, so the extra energy gets kicked out as a photon.
Whenever an electron moves to a higher orbital and then falls back to its nat-
ural orbital, the excess energy is released (emitted) as light.
Sounds pretty busy, but each atom has to play by three rigid rules:
 Only photons with a certain specific amount of energy can be absorbed
or emitted.
 Each electron can only enter certain orbitals.
 Each atom can only emit or absorb photons of certain frequencies.
In essence, it takes a certain amount of oomph to get an electron up to another
(allowed) orbital from its hometown orbital. Each electron can absorb that
much energy, no more. When the electron falls back to its familiar orbital, it
emits exactly the same amount of energy, no more.
You’re getting hotter . . .
So how do atoms get energized in the first place? In a word, heat. Heat up a
piece of metal and it gets red. Get it even hotter and it turns white. Red is 
the lowest-energy visible light. When heat really gets the atoms going, all the
colors in the visible spectrum appear at once — as white light. At the atomic
level, all those excited atoms are emitting photons like mad.
An incandescent light bulb runs electricity through a filament — a wire
designed to let its atoms heat up till they generate light. All kinds of man-made
light sources do essentially the same thing in slightly different ways, from gas
lanterns to fluorescent tubes. In the case of light sticks, a chemical reaction
generates the needed heat. But at the bottom of all these methods is the need
to energize those pesky atoms.
So what’s the point in knowing how atoms act when they’re excited? Well, 
for openers, you can figure out things at a distance — say, what’s in a far-off
planet’s atmosphere — without having to go there. You can tell what kind of
atom you’re dealing with if you know what kind of light it gives off when it’s
energized — and that’s as true for the nano realm as it is for the cosmic
realm. Which leads us to a topic called spectroscopy, which allows you to
determine what atoms are actually inside those nanomaterials.

Picking Apart Objects with Spectroscopy
The world of the very tiny is a constant bustle of activity. Things absorb, emit,
bond, break up, vibrate, and travel, but they almost never stand around doing
nothing (not even at temperatures near absolute zero). Of course, it’s hard to
catch them at it; nano-size things are too tiny to observe with the naked eye.
Studying things that small requires special, deviously clever instruments that
measure certain properties of matter — for example, spectrometers — tools
that reveal the composition of things by measuring the light absorbed or emit-
ted by atoms or molecules. Detecting and analyzing that data is the science of
spectroscopy, and in this section we discuss three types of spectroscopy:
infrared, Raman, and UltraViolet-Visible.
Infrared (IR) spectroscopy: Feel the heat
Vibration occurs in molecules because the chemical bond between atoms in
the molecules works like a spring, as shown in Figure 3-5. The strength of that
spring determines how much the atoms vibrate. Certain molecules absorb
light at certain frequencies, which increases their vibration. The frequencies
of light that can be absorbed are all in the infrared range and therefore the
method of analyzing this vibration is called infrared spectroscopy.
Because atoms come in different shapes and sizes, and bonds have different
strengths, each combination of atoms — and each type of bond — has a dif-
ferent harmonic frequency (a signature vibration that can be used to identify
the composition of a material).
Here’s how it works: Infrared light oscillates at the same frequency range as a
vibrating molecule. When you shine infrared light on a vibrating molecule, the
molecule absorbs only the frequencies that match its vibration. The energy
absorbed from the infrared light exaggerates the molecule’s movement. The
part of the light that isn’t absorbed can be measured by an infrared spectrom-
eter, telling you which frequencies the object absorbed. That’s a big clue to
the object’s composition, even if it’s a really tiny object. Speaking of which . . .
Infrared spectroscopy just happens to be extremely handy for the study of
single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs), which are discussed in Chapter 4.
Understanding the bonds between SWNTs and materials like polymers is the
key to building superstrong materials.
51
Chapter 3: Gathering the Tools of the Trade 

You can use infrared spectroscopy to obtain information about some types 
of molecules but not others. If the molecule won’t absorb frequencies in the
infrared (IR) spectrum, you’re out of luck; you have to use other types of
analysis. IR spectroscopy can identify polar molecules (the type that act like
magnets), but it can’t identify nonpolar molecules. (For more about polar and
nonpolar molecules, see “Put enough molecules together, you get materials,”
earlier in this chapter.)
Raman spectroscopy: Where’s the energy?
Nope, Raman spectroscopy is not the inspection of Chinese noodles (and
anyway that’s spelled ramen). As with Infrared spectroscopy, the energy in
photons used in Raman spectroscopy can be absorbed by the chemical bonds
between atoms, exaggerating the molecule’s movement. However, when the
chemical bonds relax, going back down to a lower level of movement, or vibra-
tion, they release a photon. The level of vibration that the bond relaxes to is
what determines the frequency of the newly released photon. For example, if
the bond either relaxes back to its original state there is no valid data. If, on
the other hand, the bond relaxes to a state that uses less energy for vibration
than the original state, then the photon that is released is a higher frequency
photon than the light used to excite it. If the bond relaxes to a state that uses
more energy for vibration than its original state, the photon released is a
lower frequency photon than the light used to excite it. Analyzing the change
in frequency from the original photon not only tells you what kind of mol-
ecules are in a sample, but also tells you about the condition of the sample.
That’s because specific molecules absorb specific amounts of light energy —
and the amount absorbed will change when they’re under strain.
Essentially, you shine a laser at a sample and analyze the light it reflects. A
laser is the best light source for this work because it produces only one fre-
quency of light — which means you can ignore any scattered light that has
the same frequency as the source. You’re looking for light with a different fre-
quency than the source.

Part I: Getting Small with Nanotechnology 

Raman spectroscopy can identify nonpolar molecules; IR spectroscopy can’t.
Of course, if you want to make a material stronger, you have to find out how 
it handles strain. In nanotechnology, you can probe the strains you put on a
structure by using Raman spectroscopy to measure how the strain changes the
vibration of the material. For example, if you’re trying to develop composites 
in which nanotubes are bonded to another material such as a polymer, Raman
spectroscopy can tell you how the strains on the nanotubes are distributed —
must-have information if you’re going to improve your composites.
UltraViolet-Visible spectroscopy: 
Who’s there?
Molecules can also absorb ultraviolet light — and even visible light. So 
naturally somebody figured out how to use those two segments of the elec-
tromagnetic spectrum for analysis. The result — UltraViolet-Visible (UV-Vis)
spectroscopy — uses either the UV or the visible part of the electromagnetic
spectrum to put energy into a sample. Although the molecules in the sample
could care less about the light, the electrons get all excited. The electrons in
each type of atom can only absorb light of certain frequencies — as we dis-
cuss in the section “Kicking out a photon.” The spectrometer measures that
frequency of light that passes through the sample, and — voilà! — the fre-
quencies that are missing reveal the identities of the atoms and molecules in
the sample. This method is often used with molecules that IR spectroscopy
can’t identify; it’s another window into the nano realm.
UV-Vis spectroscopy plays a role in the creation of nanosensors that can
detect a material and identify its composition — by bonding with it (also
called capturing), which changes the nanosensor’s properties in specific ways
that tell the tale. If you’re developing a nanosensor over this next weekend 
or so (and who isn’t?), you can use UV-Vis spectroscopy to verify the type 
of molecule that your particular nanosensor will capture.
Seeing Molecules with Microscopy
First, that microscope you used in fourth-grade science class to look at a
super-big picture of a tiny blob of blood just won’t do the job. Microscopy as
used in nanotechnology goes way beyond that simple machine and involves
some extremely sophisticated equipment. These microscopes allow you,
through various methods, to view the surface features (referred to as topogra-
phy) of atoms. Believe it or not.
53
Chapter 3: Gathering the Tools of the Trade 

Atomic force microscope (AFM)
If you’re old enough to remember what a phonograph record was, you know
that a crystal-tipped stylus (“needle”) would move along in the grooves cut 
in a spinning vinyl platter, and when the motion vibrated the needle, the
machine translated that vibration into sound. In a similar way, an atomic 
force microscope (AFM) scans the movement of a really tiny tip made of a
ceramic or semiconductor material as it travels over the surface of a mater-
ial, as shown in Figure 3-6. When that tip, positioned at the end of a cantilever
(a solid beam), is attracted to or pushed away from the sample’s surface, it
deflects the cantilever beam — and a laser measures the deflection. The AFM
then produces a visible profile of the little hills and valleys that make up the
sample’s surface.
Figure 3-7 illustrates the surface typology shown by an AFM; the hills you see
here represent atoms.
An AFM can do something you can’t do with the electron microscopes we dis-
cuss in the next section: It can get images of samples in air and underneath
liquids. That’s because an electron microscope requires that the sample be in
a vacuum — but an AFM does not. Also, an AFM produces a three-dimensional
image; electron microscopes produce only two-dimensional images.
The fineness of the tip used in an AFM is an issue — the sharper the tip, the
better the resolution. That’s why scientists hope that the future develop-
ments bring the means to produce even sharper AFM tips. It’s a natural for
nanotechnology: Use of carbon nanotubes as tips for AFMs is in its infancy,
but at least one vendor — Nanoscience Instruments, Inc. — already makes
them.

Using carbon nanotubes for AFM tips has the following benefits:
 Because the nanotube is a cylinder, rather than a pyramid, it can move
more smoothly over surfaces. Thus the AFM tip can traverse hill-and-
valley shapes without getting snagged or stopped by a too-narrow valley
(which can be a problem for pyramid-shaped tips). Because a nanotube
AFM tip is a cylinder, it’s more likely to be able to reach the bottom of
the valley.
 Because the nanotube is stronger and more flexible, it won’t break when
too much force is exerted on it (as some other tips will).
Techniques to make such tips are so new that they’re not yet fully developed.
Once they’re perfected, however, nanotube tips are sure to make AFMs even
more valuable tools for evaluating nanomaterials.
Scanning electron microscope (SEM)
You can use a scanning electron microscope (SEM) — which creates images 
of invisibly tiny things by bombarding them with a stream of electrons — to
look at features on a scale as small as 10 nanometers (billionths of a meter).
Figure 3-8 shows an SEM image of a nanotube hanging from one of the pyramid-
shaped tips used in atomic force microscopes.

An SEM shoots a beam of electrons at whatever you’re examining, transfer-
ring energy to the spot that it hits. The electrons in the beam (called primary
electrons) break off electrons in the specimen. These dislodged electrons
(called secondary electrons) are then pulled onto a positively charged grid,
where they’re translated into a signal. Moving the beam around the sample
generates a whole bunch of signals, after which the SEM can build an image
of the surface of the sample for display on a computer monitor.
SEMs can ferret out quite a bit of information about the sample:
 Topography: surface features such as texture
 Morphology: shape, size, and arrangements of the particles that com-
pose the object’s surface
 Composition: elements that make up the sample (This can be deter-
mined by measuring the X-rays produced when the electron beam hits
the sample.)

Transmission electron microscope (TEM)
Bouncing electrons off a sample is only one technique; you can also shoot
electrons through the sample and watch what happens. That’s the principle
behind a transmission electron microscope (TEM). In effect, it’s a kind of nano-
scale slide projector: Instead of shining a light through a photographic image
(which allows certain parts of the light through), the TEM sends a beam of
electrons through a sample. The electrons that get through then strike a
phosphor screen, producing a projected image: Darker areas indicate that
fewer electrons got through (hence that portion of the sample was denser);
lighter areas are where more electrons got through (that’s where the sample
was less dense).
A TEM can achieve a resolution of approximately 0.2 nanometers, roughly 
the size of many atoms. Because most atoms have diameters of at least 
0.2 nanometers, a TEM can produce images that show you just how the
atoms are arranged in a material.
Although a TEM can achieve much greater resolution than an SEM, the instru-
ment itself is costlier — and much more work is required to prepare a sample
for a TEM than for an SEM. That’s why computer-chip manufacturers use
SEMs as everyday workhorses and only fire up the TEMs for more specialized
measurements.
Typically, you’d use TEMs to analyze the morphology, crystallographic struc-
ture (arrangement of atoms in a crystal lattice), and composition of a sample.
The scanning tunneling microscope
Sounds like something out of Jules Verne, doesn’t it? But if you want to get
images of solid surfaces that conduct electricity, you can’t beat the oddly
named scanning tunneling microscope (STM). It offers the best resolution of
the bunch. This method uses an electric current (called a tunneling current)
that begins to flow when a very sharp tip moves near to a conducting surface
and hovers at about one nanometer away, as illustrated in Figure 3-9.
The tip (about the size of a single atom) sits on a piezoelectric tube. When
you apply voltage to electrodes attached to this tube, you can make teensy
adjustments to keep the tunneling current constant — which also keeps the
tip at a constant distance from the sample while an area is scanned. The
movement of the piezoelectric tube is recorded and displayed as an image 
of the sample surface.
Using a scanning tunneling microscope, you can see individual atoms on the
surface of a sample — in 3-D. This technique is used to study things such as
conductive materials and even DNA molecules.
57
Chapter 3: Gathering the Tools of the Trade 

An STM doesn’t need to operate in a vacuum, which means you can use it to
analyze samples in the air and in liquids. Often, however, a vacuum environ-
ment is used anyway to prevent samples from getting contaminated.
Magnetic Resonance Force 
Microscopy (MRFM)
MRFM is not only a mouthful to say (Magnetic Resonance Force Microscopy),
it’s a brand-spanking-new technique that takes advantage of the atomic-level
vibration going on in just about everything. Still under development at the
time of this writing (but worth watching), MRFM uses equipment similar to
an AFM, with an important difference: The tip is made of magnetic material,
and a special coil in the instrument applies a radio-frequency (RF) magnetic
field.

Part I: Getting Small with Nanotechnology 
What’s a piezoelectric tube?
If you put electrodes on the opposite sides of
some crystals — quartz or topaz, for example —
and apply a voltage across the crystal, it will
expand or contract. Any movement of the crystal 
in response to a voltage is called the piezoelec-
tric effect. The piezoelectric tube used in the
scanning tunneling microscope is simply a crys-
tal that expands or contracts depending upon the
voltage you apply to it.

Applying the RF field generated by the coil changes a quality called “spin” 
in the protons and electrons of the sample — flipping that quality back and
forth. Each flip changes the magnetic field generated by the atoms in the
sample — and the magnetic tip of the MRFM instrument moves in response.
Result: the tip and the cantilever vibrate, which deflects a laser beam pointed
at the sample. Using that deflection, the microscope detects the vibration
and produces a picture of the atoms in the sample.
The microscope used in MRFM can vary the frequency of the coil’s RF field.
By mapping the location of atoms that respond to particular frequencies, you
can (theoretically, anyway) find the precise location of specific types of
atoms in a sample, which gives you (for starters) a fine-tuned sense of the
sample’s composition — at the atomic level.
Why are people so excited about MRFM? Because MRFM has a high resolu-
tion, can go beneath the surface of a sample, and (at least theoretically) can
show atomic-scale 3-D images. Reason enough to get excited, we’d say —
especially if you’re doing nanotechnology research and development.
MRFM can be used in materials enhancement, physics, chemistry, biology,
and medicine. Because of its high resolution and pinpoint accuracy, that may
be just the beginning.
Moving the World with
Nanomanipulators
Building sand castles as a kid was easy because you could scoop up millions
of grains of sand in one hand and pack them all together. But imagine build-
ing a sand castle one grain of sand at a time.
That’s kind of what nanotechnologists are up against. What they need to
devise is a way to move around objects as tiny as a nanometer — lots and lots
of them. Like the shovel and pail you used on the beach as a kid, so-called
nanomanipulators are important tools used in the R&D of nanotechnology.
What’s available today
One way to manipulate objects whose dimensions are measured in nanome-
ters — such as carbon nanotubes — is to use atomic force microscopy
(AFM). (See the previous section for more on AFMs.) Although an atomic
force microscope is designed primarily to measure objects, it turns out that
you can also use it to move tiny objects — such as those aforementioned
carbon nanotubes.
59
Chapter 3: Gathering the Tools of the Trade 

Companies are now selling systems as add-ons to AFMs that increase their
capability to manipulate objects. Some big players here are
 3rd Tech, Inc., developer of the nanoManipulator system, which gives your
garden-variety AFM a virtual-reality interface. Equipped with one of these
jobs, when the AFM tip skims over the surface of a sample, the tip/sample
interaction is monitored. This yields information about properties such as
friction and topography. Then a computer creates a graphic image of the
surface. Using an attachment called a force-feedback pen (attached to the
scanning tip), you can touch the sample surface and manipulate objects
on it. Using this device, researchers have been able to manipulate carbon
nanotubes, DNA, and even viruses. They can bend and rotate these
objects, allowing researchers to find out more about the mechanical prop-
erties of said objects. The more you know about those properties, the
better your chances of controlling the object.
 MIT has developed a nanomanipulator called the HexFlex. Well, no, it
doesn’t use witches’ spells, but it can move samples a distance of 3nm 
(3 billionths of an inch) at a time — and that’s pretty close to magic. 
The interesting thing about its design is that there are no joints, as there
would be in a conventional manipulator arm. Instead, the main compo-
nent is a flat six-sided piece of aluminum that is flexed by exerting force
on one of its corners. MIT is developing another nanomanipulator called
the MicroHexFlex. This one is only one millimeter wide. It’s designed to
reduce the loss of energy in fiber-optic systems by improving alignment
between components.
What’s down the road
Some people are never satisfied. Give ’em the capability to move material
with the precision of a few nanometers or tens of nanometers, they complain
it just isn’t good enough. They have a vision of manipulating atoms and mol-
ecules one by one — never mind that this requires accuracy down to a tenth
of a nanometer.
If you look at today’s manufacturing methods from a nano perspective, they
are as crude as the tools our caveman ancestors fashioned by chipping away
at stone. When you mill a piece of metal, you fling molecules around here and
there — at the nano level, there’s a great lack of precision (sort of like using a
nuke to dig the basement for a house).
In chemistry, things are rosier. Folks can build crystals that have all the atoms
in the right places. We can specify the design of proteins or amino acids atom
by atom. We can even copy DNA strands with incredible accuracy. However,
our nano-abilities with manufacturing and electronics have a way to go.
60
Part I: Getting Small with Nanotechnology 

When it all converges . . .
Down the road, molecular manufacturing is sure to evolve, allowing a precision
in making components for computers or cars — molecule by molecule — that
will rival the achievements of present-day chemists. Of course, to assemble
such items in tiny pieces, we will need equally tiny robot devices. Things will
begin at the nano level, and then be built up layer by layer. Convergent technol-
ogy is the idea that you start small and by building hierarchically (level by
level), you get bigger results. If you start with robots building nanometer-sized
parts from individual atoms or molecules, and each group of robots builds
parts double the size of those built in the previous stage, it should take about
30 stages to assemble meter-size parts.
Fat fingers, sticky fingers
Currently, nanomanipulators aren’t capable of manipulating individual atoms
and molecules, or of placing them with the precision required to assemble
them into a manufactured product. Two of the challenges that scientists face
are phenomena that Richard E. Smalley, 1996 Nobel Prize winner in Chemistry
and currently teaching at Rice University, has identified. He calls these phe-
nomena fat fingers and sticky fingers. Smalley explains that you can’t make the
fingers of a manipulator arm, which are made out of atoms, any smaller. At
some point all those fingers simply don’t fit in a nanometer-size reaction space.
If you can’t fit a certain number of fingers in the space, the manipulator can’t
control the chemistry.
The “fingers” of this manipulating nanobot would not only be too fat, they’d
be too sticky, according to Smalley. The atoms that make up the manipulator
hands could stick to the atom they’re trying to move, which would mean that
releasing an atom precisely could end up being a tricky business.
While some concepts have been proposed, nobody knows what these
nanomanipulators will look like or what they will even be capable of, but
everybody is looking forward to finding out!

als that are evincing an astounding array of properties in
all kinds of products.

ead the popular science journals out there and you’ll see a lot of ink
slung about how things made with nanomaterials are going to be
stronger, more sensitive, lighter in weight, or have more load capacity than
regular old materials. Delve into the issue a bit more, and you find out that
actually getting simple carbon atoms to do all this for us is rather a complex
little story.
To understand how nanomaterials will be used, you need a clear look at not
only how they are formed but also their various configurations. In this chap-
ter, we look at nano building blocks, and how they’re currently being cajoled
into enhancing all kinds of materials and products. Some of this work is still
in the research phase; other work has graduated to the big bad world of real,
existing consumer products and applications.
It All Starts with Carbon
Carbon atoms are all over the place. In fact, you can find them in millions of
molecules. These molecules have a wide range of properties, meaning they
pop up in every possible form — from gases such as propane to solids such
as diamonds, the hardest material found in nature (and reportedly a girl’s
best friend).

There are three significant reasons for the wide range of properties of materi-
als containing carbon:
 Carbon atoms can bond together with many types of atoms, using a
process called covalent bonding (we discuss the details of covalent
bonding later in this section). When carbon atoms bond with different
types of atoms, they form molecules with properties that vary according
to the atoms they’ve bonded with.
 Each carbon atom can form these covalent bonds with four other atoms
at a time. That’s more bonds than most other atoms can form. Each nitro-
gen atom (for example) can form only three covalent bonds, each oxygen
atom can form only two covalent bonds, and so on. This four-bond capa-
bility allows carbon atoms to bond to other carbon atoms to make chains
of atoms — and to bond with other kinds of atoms at various points along
such chains. This wide range of potential combinations of atoms in a mol-
ecule allows for a correspondingly wide range of potential properties.
 There’s no other element in the periodic table that bonds as strongly to
itself and in as many ways as the carbon atom. Carbon atoms can bond
together in short chains, in which case they may have the properties of 
a gas. They may bond together as long chains, which might give you a
solid, like a plastic. Or, they can bond together in 2- or 3-dimensional lat-
tices, which can make for some very hard materials, such as a diamond.
With capabilities like these, carbon atoms are a natural for use in nanomateri-
als (as you discover in the following sections).
How Carbon-Based Things 
Relate to Nanotechnology
Buckyballs and carbon nanotubes are two types of molecules composed of
carbon atoms that have many applications in nanotechnology. (Peruse the
66
Part II: Building a Better World with Nanomaterials 
“Bond, carbon bond . . .”
In covalent bonding, the atoms that bond share
two electrons, regardless of whether they’re
shaken or stirred; this sharing of electrons is
what holds the atoms together in a molecule. If
the ability of each atom to attract all those nega-
tively charged electrons (called electronegativ-
ity) is reasonably close (that is, if the difference in
electronegativity is no more than 2), then they
can form covalent bonds. Because the elec-
tronegativity of carbon atoms is 2.5 (roughly in
the midrange), they can form strong, stable,
covalent bonds with many other types of atoms
with higher or lower values.

index of any book on nanotechnology — including this one — and you’ll find
umpteen references to buckyballs and nanotubes, a sure sign that they are
the Big Kahunas of the nanotechnology field.) We give you the lowdown on
both types of molecules later in this chapter. For the moment, however, we
tell the tale of benzene and graphite (two natural carbon-based materials).
A look at how their molecular structure influences their properties can help
explain how the same thing happens with buckyballs and nanotubes.
Delocalizing with benzene
Electrons in some carbon-based molecules are organized in orbitals that allow
the electrons to travel between atoms in the molecule. These traveling elec-
trons are called delocalized electrons. Carbon-based materials that have delo-
calized electrons can conduct electric current. One example is benzene — a
ring of six carbon atoms, each with one hydrogen atom attached, and plenty
of delocalized electrons. (Figure 4-1 shows a benzene molecule in all its glory.)
In benzene, each carbon atom uses one electron to bond with each of two
neighboring carbon atoms and one hydrogen atom. This leaves one of the
carbon atom’s four electrons hanging around, unused. The atomic orbitals
that contain these extra electrons overlap with orbitals on the adjacent
carbon atoms, forming an orbital represented by the ring-shaped cloud above
and below the ring of carbon atoms shown in Figure 4-1. This orbital allows
the electrons to move freely around the ring of carbon atoms. (These are the
delocalized electrons we told you about.)
Nanotechnologists have demonstrated that molecules such as benzene —
because they contain these handy delocalized electrons — can be used to
conduct electrical current in nano-scale electronic devices. (We discuss this
process in more detail in Chapter 8.)
This bonding method was originally called conjugated. This term springs from
a previous model of carbon bonding — which held that the extra electrons
formed bonds between every other pair of carbon atoms. This situation
would create alternating single bonds (where two electrons are shared) and
double bonds (where four electrons are shared) between carbon atoms.
Although scientists have replaced this model, some nanotechnologists still
use the term conjugated bond to indicate the presence of extra electrons that
can be used in a bonding process.

Letting things slide with graphite
Benzene gives you a simple example of how delocalized electrons work;
based on that understanding, now you can see how a slightly more complex
material, graphite (the tip of your #2 pencil), also conducts electricity.
A graphite molecule is, like benzene, a collection of carbon rings — but it’s
built differently: The same electrons that benzene uses to bond each carbon
atom to a hydrogen atom are used instead to bond carbon atoms to other
carbon atoms in adjacent carbon rings. What you get for a molecule is a
sheet of interlocking hexagonal carbon rings, as shown in Figure 4-2. In this
structure, each carbon atom bonds covalently to three other carbon atoms.
The bonds are all carbon-to-carbon till you get to the edge of the graphite
sheet, where the carbon atoms bond to hydrogen atoms (one each).
As with benzene, each carbon atom in graphite has an “extra” electron — one
more than the number of atoms it’s bonded to. The atomic orbitals for these
electrons overlap to form a molecular orbital that allows delocalized electrons
to move freely throughout an entire graphite sheet. That’s why graphite con-
ducts electricity.
A sheet of graphite is very strong because of the interlocking carbon-to-carbon
covalent bonds. But wait a minute: The graphite in pencil lead doesn’t seem all
that strong (and it smudges all over you if you’re not careful). That’s because
it’s composed of many parallel sheets of graphite. Although each individual
sheet of graphite is very strong, it’s only one carbon atom thick — that’s less
than a nanometer. Because all the electrons have been put to use within the
molecular sheet, the bonding between sheets of carbon is done with van der
Waals’ forces, which are very weak. The graphite sheets can slide across each
other easily, which makes graphite useful as a lubricant or as a drawing tool —
when you draw a picture of your house, sheets of graphite slide off onto the
piece of paper.

Two properties of graphite sheets make them especially useful in nanotech-
nology: their strength and their ability to conduct electricity. Buckyballs and
nanotubes are essentially graphite sheets shaped into spheres or tubes —
and the next few sections provide a closer look.
Bouncing Buckyballs
A buckyball (short for buckminsterfullerene, a term we explain shortly) is a
molecule containing 60 carbon atoms. Each carbon atom is bonded to three
adjacent carbon atoms, just as in graphite. However the carbon atoms in a
buckyball form a teensy-weensy sphere that’s about 1 nanometer in diameter,
as shown in Figure 4-3. Because one of the properties of carbon atoms is that
they can bond to many other types of atoms, researchers can use them to
create customized molecules, useful in various applications discussed
throughout this book.

Chapter 4: Nanomaterials Galore
Desperately seeking buckyballs
Buckyballs were discovered through an inter-
esting collaboration of researchers from two
universities. Richard Smalley at Rice University
was studying semiconductor materials. He had
a device that shined a laser at a solid sample,
vaporized part of it, and analyzed the clusters of
atoms that formed in the vapor.
Meanwhile, at the University of Sussex, Harry
Kroto was attempting to reproduce a material
found in deep space that generated specific
molecular spectra from carbon atoms. Bob Curl,
also from Rice University, was doing similar
work. Curl ran into Kroto at a symposium and
suggested he drop by Rice University because
Smalley’s scientific instrumentation might be
helpful in his work. Kroto dropped by Rice, and
after seeing the work that Smalley was doing,
he became interested in using that equipment
to reproduce his carbon molecules.
Time spent working with high-end scientific
equipment is always at a premium, so Kroto had
to wait about a year until the equipment was
available. In August of 1985, Smalley, Kroto, Curl,
and some graduate students performed a series
of experiments producing carbon molecules
and clusters. They found that under certain con-
ditions, most of the molecules generated con-
tained 60 carbon atoms. Voilà: buckyballs.

While many of the atoms in buckyballs are connected together in hexagons
(just as in graphite sheets), some of the atoms are connected together in pen-
tagons. The pentagons allow the sheet of carbon atoms to curve into the
shape of a sphere. Every buckyball surface contains 12 pentagons and 20
hexagons.
After much discussion and modeling, researchers determined that 60 carbon
atoms form a single stable molecule only if they’re arranged in 20 hexagons and
12 pentagons that are linked to form a sphere — as it happens, it’s the same
arrangement of hexagons and pentagons proposed by American architect and
engineer Buckminster Fuller for his famed geodesic dome. No wonder these
molecules got dubbed buckminsterfullerenes (that’s fullerenes for short) in his
honor. This type of spherical carbon molecule has been found in various other
sizes. The fullerene family of molecules is often identified by the letter C fol-
lowed by the number of carbon atoms, for example C60, C70, C80.
Creating buckyballs
Richard Smalley, one of the scientists credited with discovering buckyballs
(see sidebar), produced the little wonders in a device by vaporizing carbon
with a laser and allowing the carbon atoms to condense. However, this device
could only produce a very small number of buckyballs — enough to show
their existence but not enough to allow thorough study of their capabilities.
It took collaboration between researchers at the Max Planck Institute in
Germany and the University of Arizona to figure out how to make larger quan-
tities of buckyballs. Operating on a shoestring, they vaporized carbon by
placing two carbon electrodes close together and generating an electric arc
between them in a reaction chamber filled with a low pressure of helium or
neon (neither of which will bond with carbon). This method generated much
larger quantities of buckyballs than Smalley’s device did, although the bucky-
balls had to be separated from carbon soot by using solvents such as ben-
zene. The method produced enough buckyballs to analyze for their electrical
and physical properties.
But what if you want to produce buckyballs by the truckload (as you’d need to
for most commercial applications)? A little tech school in Massachusetts called
MIT, working with a company called Nano-C, Inc., developed a method called
combustion synthesis, which produces big enough quantities of buckyballs — at
a low enough cost — for use in commercial applications. This method mixes a
hydrocarbon with oxygen and burns the hydrocarbon at a low pressure. Nano-C
states that its latest version of this process produces buckyball material pure
enough (about 95 percent) to skip the step that separates the product from the
carbon soot — and that reduces costs significantly.
70
Part II: Building a Better World with Nanomaterials 

Do you need buckyballs by the ton? The Frontier Carbon Corporation, a sub-
sidiary of the Mitsubishi Corporation, has built a facility capable of produc-
ing 40 tons of buckyballs per year. They started production with an early
version of the combustion-synthesis process developed by MIT and Nano-C,
but have since switched to an undisclosed technique developed at Kyoto
University.
Using buckyballs in the real world
At the time of this writing, most of the commercial applications of buckyballs
are still in development. But just where does the most promise lie?
Buckyballs as antioxidants
The medical field is one place that buckyballs appear to have a promising
future. C Sixty, Inc., is one of the companies developing medical applications
for buckyballs. They are focusing on the ability of buckyballs to act as antiox-
idants, counteracting free radicals in the human body.
A free radical is a molecule or atom that has an unpaired electron — which
makes it very reactive. An antioxidant is a molecule that can supply an elec-
tron and neutralize a free radical. The human body normally has a balance of
free radicals and antioxidants; a certain level of free radicals is actually nec-
essary to make your immune system work. However, the level of antioxidants
found naturally in your body decreases as you get older. The resulting high
level of free radicals roaming around your system could be the cause of cer-
tain diseases.
Buckyballs can act as antioxidants to neutralize free radicals. When a bucky-
ball meets a free radical, the unpaired electron in the free radical pairs up
with one of the buckyball’s delocalized electrons, forming a covalent bond
between the free radical and a carbon atom in the buckyball.
One problem with using buckyballs as an antioxidant is that antioxidants have
to be soluble in water to be truly useful as medical applications. Buckyballs are
not naturally soluble in water, and therefore not soluble in the bloodstream.
(Remember that water makes up about 80 percent of blood.) To make bucky-
balls soluble, C Sixty has added a water-soluble molecule to them. This is done
by covalently bonding an atom in the water-soluble molecule to one of the
carbon atoms in the buckyball.
Bonding an atom or molecule to a buckyball to change the properties of the
buckyball is called functionalization.
Merck, Inc., has obtained a licensing option on C Sixty’s antioxidant, and is
jumping through the various hoops of evaluation and qualification that the
government requires before new drugs can be provided to the medical field.
71
Chapter 4: Nanomaterials Galore

They are going to all this trouble because studies have shown that buckyball-
based antioxidants are several times more effective than antioxidants avail-
able today. Each buckyball-based antioxidant can counteract several free
radicals because each buckyball has many carbon atoms for the free radicals
to bond to. Antioxidant molecules currently in use can only counteract one
free-radical molecule apiece; they have fewer places to which free radicals
can attach themselves.
Improving medical imaging and drug delivery with buckyballs
Another potential use of buckyballs in medicine involves delivering elements
for medical imaging. When you make a buckyball, you vaporize carbon. If you
vaporize a metal along with the carbon, buckyballs conveniently form around
the metal atoms. Fast-forward to the metal gadolinium, which is used for med-
ical imaging, but with gadolinium there’s a danger that some of the metal can
remain in a body and cause damage. By containing these potentially harmful
metal atoms in a buckyball, researchers hope to be able to flush the metal-
enclosed-in-a-buckyball combination completely from the body after it has
accomplished its medical imaging task, rather than leaving it there where it
could be absorbed into tissue. (Chapter 10 details the use of buckyballs for
medical imaging.)
Another use of buckyballs is to deliver drugs directly to infected regions of
the body. It turns out that such regions have pH levels that differ from the pH
of the healthy bits (pH measures the acidity of a solution). Researchers hope
to functionalize a buckyball by bonding it to molecules that react to changes
in pH, so the drug is only released at the infected area. In Chapter 11 we dis-
cuss this method in more detail.
One other reason buckyballs are useful for drug delivery is that they are
small enough to move around inside the body quite easily.
Buckyballs at work everywhere
Here’s a quick rundown of various efforts that are going on today to develop
products using the capabilities of buckyballs. When these products will
become available is anybody’s guess at this point, but it depends in part on
our ability to produce low-cost buckyballs.
 Dupont and Exxon are using buckyballs to develop stronger polymers.
These companies are looking at two ways of doing this: by integrating
the buckyballs in the polymer with chemical bonding, or by simply toss-
ing buckyballs into the polymer and embedding them there.
 Additional buckyball-based antioxidant type drugs are being developed
or tested. For example, anti-aging or anti-wrinkle creams are being devel-
oped by Mitsubishi, Taiwan University is testing a buckyball-based drug
to fight arteriosclerosis, and C Sixty is working on both burn creams and
an HIV drug.

 Sony is developing more efficient fuel cell membranes using buckyballs.
 Siemens has developed a buckyball-based light detector.
 Seagate is using buckyballs to develop diamond-hard coatings for com-
puter disk drives.
Buckyballs Grow Up to 
Become Nanotubes
As far back as 1959, Roger Bacon had produced images of carbon nanotubes.
In the 1980s, Howard Tennant applied for a patent for a method to produce
them. In 1990, Richard Smalley postulated the concept that if buckyballs get
big enough, they become carbon cylinders. But it wasn’t until 1991 that
Sumio Iijima, a researcher at NEC’s Fundamental Research Lab, not only took
photos of nanotubes, but also put two and two together to explain what nan-
otubes actually are — and put a name to them. He placed a sample of carbon
soot containing buckyballs in an electron microscope to produce some pho-
tographs of buckyballs — which he in fact did — but some odd, needle-
shaped structures caught his attention.
It turned out that these needle shapes were actually cylinders of carbon
atoms that were formed at the same time that the buckyballs were formed.
Like buckyballs, these cylinders (called carbon nanotubes) are each a lattice
of carbon atoms — with each atom covalently bonded to three other carbon
atoms. Carbon nanotubes are basically buckyballs, but the end never closes
into a sphere when they are formed. Instead of forming the shape of a sphere,
the lattice forms the shape of a cylinder, as illustrated in Figure 4-4.
Nanotubes come in a couple of varieties. They can either be single-walled
carbon nanotubes (SWNT) or multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNT). As you
might expect, an SWNT is just a single cylinder, whereas an MWNT consists
of multiple concentric nanotube cylinders, as illustrated in Figure 4-5. We’ll
tell you about SWNTs rather than MWNTs, because most research is focused
on developing uses for single-walled nanotubes.
The length and diameter of SWNTs varies, but a typical SWNT would be about
1 nanometer in diameter and a few hundred nanometers in length. The small-
est diameter anybody has ever seen in SWNTs is about the same as the C60
buckyball, just under 1 nanometer.

Producing nanotubes from thin air
Researchers found that by adding just a few percentage points of vaporized
nickel nanoparticles to the vaporized carbon (using either the arc-discharge
or laser-vaporization method to produce the vapor), they could make as
many nanotubes as buckyballs — or even more. Here’s why: Carbon atoms
dissolve in the metal nanoparticle. When the metal nanoparticle is filled to
the brim with carbon atoms, carbon atoms start sweating onto the surface of
the particle and bond together, growing a nanotube. When you anchor one
end of the growing nanotube to the metal nanoparticle, it can’t close into the
sphere shape of a buckyball. This also allows the nanotubes to incorporate
many more carbon atoms than a buckyball.
This method produces both single and multiple walled nanotubes intermin-
gled with carbon soot. (If you want to know how to get nanotubes out of the
marshmallows you roast over your campfire, flip over to Chapter 5, where we
discuss methods of removing nanotubes from the carbon soot and untangling
them.)
Once they discovered nanotubes, researchers set about trying to figure out
ways to produce lots of them. There are three methods that various compa-
nies have developed to produce carbon nanotubes in bulk quantities and at a
lower cost:
 The first method is called high-pressure carbon monoxide deposition, 
or HiPCO. This method involves a heated chamber through which
carbon monoxide gas and small clusters of iron atoms flow. When
carbon monoxide molecules land on the iron clusters, the iron acts as a
catalyst and helps a carbon monoxide molecule break up into a carbon
atom and an oxygen atom. The carbon atom bonds with other carbon
atoms to start the nanotube lattice; the oxygen atom joins with another
carbon monoxide molecule to form carbon dioxide gas, which then
floats off into the air.
 The second method is called chemical-vapor deposition, or CVD. In this
method, a hydrocarbon — say, methane gas (one carbon atom and four
hydrogen atoms) — flows into a heated chamber containing a substrate
coated with a catalyst, such as iron particles. The temperature in the
chamber is high enough to break the bonds between the carbon atoms
and the hydrogen atoms in the methane molecules — resulting in carbon
atoms with no hydrogen atoms attached. Those carbon atoms attach to
the catalyst particles, where they bond to other carbon atoms — forming
a nanotube.
 A brand-new method uses a plasma process to produce nanotubes.
Methane gas, used as the source of carbon, is passed through a plasma
torch. Nobody’s revealed the details of this process yet, such as what, if
any, catalyst is used. One of the initial claims is that this process is 25
times more efficient at producing nanotubes than the other two methods.
75
Chapter 4: Nanomaterials Galore

Eying the structure of carbon nanotubes
A carbon nanotube is a cylinder of carbon atoms covalently bonded together,
sort of like a sheet of graphite rolled into a cylinder. Some of these cylinders
are closed at the ends and some are open. Each carbon atom is bonded to
three other carbon atoms and forms a lattice in the shape of hexagons (six-
sided rings of carbon atoms), except near the end. For nanotubes with closed
ends, where the ends start to curve to form a cap, the lattice forms pen-
tagons (five-sided rings of carbon atoms).
The lattice can be orientated differently, which makes for three different
kinds of nanotubes. As shown in Figure 4-6, in armchair nanotubes, there is 
a line of hexagons parallel to the axis of the nanotube. In zigzag nanotubes,
there’s a line of carbon bonds down the center. Chiral nanotubes exhibit a
twist or spiral (called chirality) around the nanotube. We discuss how the ori-
entation of the lattice helps determine the electrical properties of the nano-
tube later in this chapter.
Scanning the properties of nanotubes
One property of nanotubes is that they’re really, really strong. Tensile strength
is a measure of the amount of force an object can withstand without tearing
apart. The tensile strength of carbon nanotubes is approximately 100 times
greater than that of steel of the same diameter.
There are two things that account for this strength. The first is the strength
provided by the interlocking carbon-to-carbon covalent bonds. The second 
is the fact that each carbon nanotube is one large molecule. This means it

76
Part II: Building a Better World with Nanomaterials 

doesn’t have the weak spots found in other materials, such as the boundaries
between the crystalline grains that form steel.
Nanotubes are strong but are also elastic. This means it takes a lot of force to
bend a nanotube, but the little guy will spring right back to its original shape
when you release it, just like a rubber band does. Researchers have used
atomic force microscopes to physically push nanotubes around and observe
their elastic properties. Evaluations with transmission electron microscopes —
the kind of microscope sensitive enough to give you a peek at atomic shapes —
show that the bonds in the atomic lattice don’t break when you bend or com-
press a nanotube.
Young’s modulus for carbon nanotubes, a measurement of how much force it
takes to bend a material, is about 5 times higher than for steel, so if you were
thinking of going out and bending a nanotube, think again. The fact is, there’s
not another element with a lattice structure in the whole periodic table that
bonds to itself with as much strength as carbon atoms. And, since carbon
nanotubes have such a perfect structure, they avoid the degradation of
strength that you get with other materials.
In addition to being strong and elastic, carbon nanotubes are also light-
weight, with a density about one quarter that of steel.
As if that weren’t enough, carbon nanotubes also conduct heat and cold
really well (they have a high thermal conductivity); some researchers predict 
a thermal conductivity more than 10 times that of silver — and if you’ve ever
picked up a fork from a hot stove, you know silver and other metals are
pretty darn good conductors of heat. While metals depend upon the move-
ment of electrons to conduct heat, carbon nanotubes conduct heat by the
vibration of the covalent bonds holding the carbon atoms together; the
atoms themselves are wiggling around and transmitting the heat through 
the material. The stiffness of the carbon bond helps transmit this vibration
throughout the nanotube, providing very good thermal conductivity.
A diamond, which is also a lattice of carbon atoms covalently bonded, uses
the same method to conduct heat, so it’s also an excellent thermal conductor,
as well as a stunning piece of jewelry.
Carbon nanotubes are a little bit sticky, as well. The electron clouds on the
surface of each nanotube provide a mild attractive force between the nano-
tubes. This attraction is called van der Waals’ force (which we discuss in
Chapter 3). This involves forces between nonpolar molecules (a molecule
without a positive end and a negative end). A carbon nanotube just happens
to be a nonpolar molecule.
77
Chapter 4: Nanomaterials Galore

But not all nanotubes are exactly alike. Armchair nanotubes all have electri-
cal properties like metals — but only about a third of all zigzag and chiral
nanotubes have electrical properties like metal; the rest (roughly two thirds)
have electrical properties like semiconductors. (For more about the differ-
ence, see the “Metallic or semiconducting?” sidebar in this chapter.) A metal-
lic carbon nanotube conducts electricity when you connect different voltages
to each end, just like a wire. Applying a negative voltage at one end and a
positive voltage at the other end causes electrons to flow towards the posi-
tive voltage. To get electrons to flow through a semiconducting carbon nan-
otube, you also have to add some energy. (You could shine light on the
nanotube, for example.)
Carbon nanotubes conduct electricity better than metals. When electrons
travel through metal there is some resistance to their movement. This resis-
tance happens when electrons bump into metal atoms. When an electron
travels through a carbon nanotube, it’s traveling under the rules of quantum
mechanicals, and so it behaves like a wave traveling down a smooth channel
with no atoms to bump into. This quantum movement of an electron within
nanotubes is called ballistic transport.
78
Part II: Building a Better World with Nanomaterials 
Metallic or semiconducting?
The diameter of a carbon nanotube and the
amount of twist in its lattice determines whether
it’s metallic or semiconducting. Electrons in
carbon nanotubes can only be at certain energy
levels, just like electrons in atoms. A nanotube is
metallic if the energy level that allows delocal-
ized electrons to flow between atoms through-
out the nanotube (referred to as the conduction
band) is right above the energy level used by
electrons attached to atoms (the valance band).
In a metallic nanotube, electrons can easily
move to the conduction band. A nanotube is
semiconducting if the energy level of the con-
duction band is high enough so that there is an
energy gap between it and the valance band. In
this case, additional energy, such as light, is
needed for an electron to jump that gap to move
to the conduction band. While there is no gap
between the valance and conduction bands for
armchair nanotubes (which makes them metal-
lic), an energy gap does exist between the
valance and conduction bands in about two
thirds of zigzag and chiral nanotubes — which
makes them semiconducting.
Obviously, it’s important to be able to control
what type of nanotube you are growing. Most
current production processes for nanotubes
create both metallic and semiconductor nan-
otubes. Researchers at Rice University have hit
on a way to control this process. They take short
lengths of nanotubes of the type they want and
attach nanocatalyst particles (typically a metal
such as nickel) to one end. These nanotubes are
placed in the reaction chamber and act like
seeds. New, long, nanotubes are grown from
these seeds, kind of like nanotube cloning.

Carbon atoms in nanotubes, like those in buckyballs, have the ability to cova-
lently bond to other atoms or molecules creating a new molecule with cus-
tomized properties. Bonding an atom or molecule to a nanotube to change its
properties is called functionalization.
Putting nanotubes to good use
Researchers at Rice University are developing a way to form wires out of nano-
tubes. The process used to spin polymer fibers together to make Kevlar cables
was used as a model to figure out how to spin nanotubes together into a wire.
The wire is a bunch of metallic armchair nanotubes bundled together.
In a wire made of carbon nanotubes, electric current could zip through like a
skater on ice. In addition, less energy would be wasted as heat. It would also
weigh less than conventional wire, while being able to conduct huge doses of
current. The impact of such wire on energy technologies could be big.
Researchers are also looking into using carbon nanotubes to detect chemical
vapors. The way this would work would be that molecules that make up a
chemical vapor would land on the nanotube and attach themselves to it by
forming covalent bonds with the carbon atoms in it. This would change the
electrical conductivity of the nanotube by decreasing or increasing the
number of delocalized electrons available for conduction, which would then
trigger an alarm of some kind.
Sensors using carbon nanotubes have been shown to detect chemical vapors
with concentrations in the parts per billion (ppb). One problem is that many
molecules can interact with carbon nanotubes in this way. In order to ensure
that sensors are detecting the right chemical, researchers coat nanotubes with
a polymer that allows certain molecules to reach the nanotube and blocks
others. (We discuss nanotube-based chemical-vapor sensors in Chapter 8.)
79
Chapter 4: Nanomaterials Galore
What’s in a name?
Electrons travel ballistically within the nano-
tubes formed into a wire; however, in order to
transfer between nanotubes, electrons use a
method called quantum tunneling. This jump in
space is something like riding along the high-
way in a car and suddenly finding yourself in a
car in the next lane. This type of wire is being
called armchair quantum wire because of the
use of armchair nanotubes and the quantum
nature of electron transport within the wire. If
armchair quantum wire becomes available, its
first application would be in situations where
reducing weight is critical, such as in satellites
and airplanes.

There’s also the possibility of storing hydrogen in nanotubes. Imagine a mate-
rial that can absorb hydrogen like a sponge absorbs water. This material
could be used as a fuel tank for hydrogen fuel cell-powered cars. (We discuss
various research efforts using nanotechnology to improve hydrogen produc-
tion and storage in Chapter 9.)
Researchers are looking at using nanotubes, as well as other nano-size mate-
rials, to make transistors, memory cells, and wires. As the complexity of com-
puter chips increases, it’s very important to reduce the size of the devices
and wires. Currently the narrowest device or wire used in computer chips 
is 90 nanometers. With nanotubes and nanowires (see the next section) we
could produce transistors and memory devices about a nanometer wide.
This effort is called molecular electronics and we talk about it in more detail
in Chapter 8.
Wire made from nanotubes is not the same as nanowire. Nanowire is a
nanoscopic solid wire made of various metals — too small to be seen by the
human eye. Wire made from nanotubes is like a woven fiber made from many,
many nanotubes — and that could be as big as a standard electrical cord.
Getting Wired with Nanowires
Nanowires are simply very tiny wires. They are composed of metals such as
silver, gold, or iron, or semiconductors such as silicon, zinc oxide, and germa-
nium. Nanoparticles are used to create these little nanowires, which can have
a diameter as small as 3 nanometers.
Growing nanowires
The production of nanowires is similar to nanotubes; it requires using a cata-
lyst particle in a heated reaction chamber. To grow nanowires composed of
gallium-nitride, researchers at Harvard University flow nitrogen gas and
vaporized gallium through the reaction chamber containing an iron target.
Iron nanoparticles are vaporized from the target by a laser to act as a cata-
lyst. Both gallium and nitrogen molecules dissolve in the iron nanoparticle.
When you get so much gallium and nitrogen in the particle that it starts to
sweat off of the surface, molecules precipitate onto the surface of the particle
where they combine to grow the nanowire.
When you grow any nanowire, the materials you use must be soluble in the
catalyst nanoparticle. For example, to grow silicon nanowires, a gold catalyst
nanoparticle is used because silicon dissolves in gold.
80
Part II: Building a Better World with Nanomaterials 

To grow arrays of nanowires — great for making electronic devices or sen-
sors — you can use catalyst nanoparticles positioned on a solid substrate,
rather than nanoparticles in a vapor. For example, researchers at the National
Institute of Standards and Technology have used gold nanoparticles on a 
sapphire surface as catalysts to grow arrays of nanowires composed of zinc
oxide. By changing the size of the gold nanoparticles, they are able to control
whether the nanowires grow tilted vertically at a 60-degree angle up from the
surface, or horizontally along the surface.
Nanowires at work
Several research groups have demonstrated the use of nanowires to create
memory devices and transistors. Researchers at Hewlett-Packard and the
University of California at Los Angeles have demonstrated that a memory cell
can be formed at the intersection of two nanowires. You can see a crossbar
array of these nanowires in Figure 4-7 (courtesy of Hewlett-Packard). Using a
somewhat more complicated array of nanowires, they have also come up
with a transistor-like device called a crossbar latch.
Folks at the University of Southern California and the NASA Ames Research
Center have demonstrated a memory device that uses indium oxide nanowires.
They are predicting that this device will be able to store 40 gigabits per square
centimeter, which is a lot of data by anybody’s standards.
Building transistors and memory devices used in computer chips from mate-
rials about the width of a nanometer, such as nanowires, is called molecular
electronics. We discuss molecular electronics in more detail in Chapter 8.
Meanwhile, over at Harvard University they’ve demonstrated a nanowire-
based sensor that can detect diseases in blood samples. The working part 
of the sensor is a nanowire that has been functionalized by attaching certain
nucleic acid molecules to it. The nucleic acid molecules bond to a cystic

fibrosis gene if it is present in a blood sample. When this happens, the con-
ductance of the nanowires changes. The change in the nanowire conductance
causes a current to flow.
This type of sensor has the potential to provide immediate analysis of blood
samples for a variety of diseases, possibly right in your doctor’s office with
just a pinprick in your finger. That’s much more convenient than giving vials
full of blood and waiting for a test to come back from a lab. Add to that, this
sensor is highly sensitive and might detect diseases we’ve never even been
able to detect before, or detect viruses at an earlier stage.
But there’s a major challenge for researchers developing this technique,
either with nanowires or nanotubes: They have to find a way to make the sen-
sors selective and prevent false signals. In the Harvard demonstration, they
did this by using a specific nucleic acid that would only bond to the cystic
fibrosis gene. We talk more about nanotechnology in medical diagnosis in
Chapter 10.
Finally, researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, 
as well as the folks at the Max Planck Institute, are investigating the use of
nanowires to increase the density of a magnetic recording medium (such as
the disk drives used in computers). Both groups have been able to deposit
arrays of magnetic nanowires — and their work shows that it’s feasible to use
this type of structure to store information at a much higher density than cur-
rent disk drives can. However, other researchers are investigating the idea of
using certain arrangements of nanoparticles to do the same thing as
nanowires. It’s a toss-up as to which idea will win out.

ear the term “composite” and you probably think either “high-priced
golf clubs” or — if you’re a Michael Crichton fan — airframe structures.
While high-priced golf clubs and airframe structures are both intimately tied
up with composite technologies, composites have a wide variety of applica-
tions that will continue to grow with nanotechnology. It should come as no
surprise, then, that we decided to devote an entire chapter to the role com-
posites play in the nanotechnology story.
Compose This!
A composite is an engineered material “composed” of two or more compo-
nents. There are many types of composites — some are made from flakes
pressed and glued together (particle board), others are constructed from
fibers (fiberglass). Usually, a fiber acts as a backbone for the material and a
matrix binds the fibers together. Fibers are chosen for their strength and the
matrix is chosen for its ability to bond to these fibers. The reason we add the
fiber is to enhance the strength of the finished material.
Need a handy metaphor? Think of pizza, that manna from heaven for stu-
dents everywhere, as a loose form of a composite. The bread is the substrate
(structural base), the meats are the fiber, and the cheese, when melted, binds
the meats together in a matrix. (Okay, maybe it’s not the best building mater-
ial for, say, suspension bridges, but it sure tastes pretty good.) A common
composite that you may have heard of — more structurally sound than 
pizza — is the particle board found in houses and furniture. Particleboard is
a plywood substitute that consists of wood flakes and sawdust bonded
together with glue and pressed into sheets. Pretty good for a twentieth-
century innovation, but nano can do better.

Lighter, stronger, cheaper
The nice thing about composites is not just that they’re strong — they are
also “moldable.” Why use the bulk material (say, aluminum) when a compos-
ite composed of glass and epoxy will be just as strong or even stronger? Not
to mention the fact that molding bulk aluminum into desired shapes (air
frames or boat hulls) may not be as effective as molding a plastic matrix-
based composite. This composite may even be lighter and stronger. You can
see that composites are our first attempt to make the perfect material —
lighter, stronger, and cheaper.
Interfacing the fiber with the matrix
The most important concept to pull away from composites involves the
importance of the fiber/matrix interface — that place where two unlike mate-
rials join together to become (hopefully) indissolubly one. For what good
would fiberglass be if the interface could not stand up to the pressures of the
job — say, if the fibers easily became disengaged from the matrix? You might
be able to market such fiberglass as cheap insulation, but forget about using
it in a vaulting pole or as a boat hull.
So, the better your interface is at keeping the bonds between fiber and matrix
indissoluble, the greater the structural integrity of the entire composite. We
reaallllyy want the fibers and the matrix to structurally adhere to each other.
(Otherwise, we’d have this sloppy mess that would pull apart like cotton —
or, yeah, cheap insulation.) But better interfaces also mean better (more
effective) load transfer — transfer of load from the bulk composite to the
matrix to the fiber.
And how do we get better interfaces? Funny you should ask. As you might
expect, given the title of this book, we’re pretty sure that nanotechnology
holds the key. We’re willing to bet the farm that working at the nano scale will
allow us to enhance both the structural integrity of the entire composite as
well as the load transfer between both the fiber and matrix, thus adding
strength to composites.
One Word: Plastics
When Rich went off to college in 1995, his dad said, “One word: World Wide
Web.” “But that’s three words,” Rich said. His dad was, in his own way, trying
to express the future importance of the Internet by mirroring the famous line
84
Part II: Building a Better World with Nanomaterials 

from the 1967 movie The Graduate, “Just one word: plastics.” At 18, Rich (like
most teenagers at that age) thought he knew everything and didn’t listen to
the advice the way he probably should have. When he graduated from col-
lege, his dad approached him again and said, “One word: nanotechnology.”
This time, he listened.
Plastics (polymers) have gradually infiltrated our lives over the last hundred
years, from shiny handles to credit cards to kitchenware to computer cases
to cheap furniture. These days they’re so commonplace that it’s hard to get
excited about them — unless you take a nano-perspective. Only then can you
see a polymer in all its quirky glory, spilling out as a long, elaborate chain of
carbon- or silicon-based molecules (as shown in Figure 5-1) — now not only
common but outrageously tweakable at the molecular level.

Chapter 5: Adding Strength with Composites

If you take a look at plastic’s family tree, you’ll see that plastic’s great-great-
great-granddad was natural rubber. A momentous year in this ancestor’s life
was 1839, when Charles Goodyear “vulcanized” rubber by cooking the fellow
in sulfur. Up until that time, rubber would become sticky in hot temperatures
and brittle in cold temperatures. (Kind of like Rich’s own great-grandfather.)
Without vulcanization, we wouldn’t have adequate tires for our cars, a state
of affairs that would have drastically hindered our industrialization.
Another landmark date in the march toward plastic perfection was 1894,
when a natural polymer, cellulose, was used to replace expensive silk. (Okay,
“rayon” — the cousin of cellulose — didn’t have quite the panache of silk, but
it was a heck of a lot cheaper and easier to take care of.) “Bakelite,” the start-
ing point for umpteen thousands of pieces of costume jewelry, electrical insu-
lators, and radio sets, came about in 1909 and is considered the first purely
synthetic plastic and “thermoset” — tough and temperature-resistant.
Thermoplastics can be molded, allowed to cool, and then melted again. On
the other hand, thermosets are molded once and “cured” — the plastic forms
a tight matrix that cannot be undone without destroying the plastic itself.
Bakelite — cheap, strong, and durable — shows up in radios (see above),
telephones, clocks, and even billiard balls.
Plastics continued to develop through the world wars, throwing off products
like Styrofoam, PVC, nylon, acrylic, epoxy, Mylar, Teflon, and Kevlar. Table 5-1
gives a listing of the approximate birth years of some common plastics, as
well as their many uses (and a sense of just how fast they’ve emerged).

Dissipating static electricity
The history of plastics is truly a fascinating topic, but we can understand that
you may feel that a little bit of plastics history goes a long way. Time to move
on to a topic more relevant to the great promise we see on the nanotechno-
logical horizon. That’s right, it’s time to talk about laundry.
Anyone who regularly pulls their socks out of their dryer has probably 
had a fateful encounter with static electricity at least once in their lives —
zzzzzttttt!! These small-but-startling electric shocks are a handy illustration 
of electrostatics — the force exerted by an unchanging electric field upon a
charged object.
Now, getting shocked by your socks or having your hair stand on end after
taking off a sweater may sound pretty harmless, but the truth is, static elec-
tricity and electromagnetic interference play a huge role in destroying our
electrical circuits and computer equipment. (Forty percent of all failures can
be attributed to electrostatic discharge!) Case in point: your computer. If
you’ve ever bought a sound card for your computer, it was more than likely
wrapped in pretty silver plastic. These plastics dissipate any static electricity
that may build up, protecting the electronic equipment from a sudden surge.
And then, when you go to install the sound card, you’ll find that Rule Number
One in the installation manual accompanying the sound card states that, after
you open up the case to access your computer’s innards, you have to ground
yourself by touching the metal casing. This removes any static electricity
that may have accumulated while you were rubbing your socks against the
carpet. Ignore Rule Number One and you may end up with a sound card that’s
been fried by the same little spark of static electricity that shocks you from
your socks.
Your home computer isn’t the only piece of electronics out there that needs
to be shielded. Just ask the U.S. military. They shield their equipment from
electromagnetic pulses — for example, those given off during a nuclear 
explosion (which would severely scramble the brains of any piece of elec-
tronic equipment not so shielded). And then there’s the Federal Aviation
Administration — very much interested in keeping an increasingly automated
and electronics-dependent commercial air fleet safe by shielding onboard
electronic equipment from interference. Hopefully, the nuclear Armageddon
scenario doesn’t play out, but you can understand the broad array of uses for
protecting electronic equipment — from your home to your transportation to
your defense.
87
Chapter 5: Adding Strength with Composites

It turns out that carbon nanotubes — the same guys who play a starring 
role in our discussion of molecular architectures in Chapter 4 — also do a
fantastic job of dissipating static electricity while dispersed in plastics. 
How fantastic? Well, the following description of work done by Zyvex
Corporation — in conjunction with Michigan Tech — may give you an idea.
This work offers a particularly telling look at the difficulties of working at the
nano scale — as well as the big payoffs that can be achieved.
The carbon nanotube connection
The folks at Zyvex Corporation saw clearly that one key to an effective com-
posite is the even dispersion of the fiber in the matrix. You don’t want the
fibers to bunch up just in one area; that would tend to weaken other areas.
Unfortunately, carbon nanotubes on their own tend to want to clump
together — a direct result of their van der Waals’ forces. (No, that’s not some
Dutch prog-rock group from the 1970s.) Van der Waals’ forces are a lot like
the static electricity binding your socks together when they come out of the
dryer — very weak attractive forces. They’re different from the chemical
bonds that actually attach molecules to each other — those are more like
sewing your socks together.
Okay, even dispersion of fiber is important if you want to work with carbon
nanotubes — and if you want to keep the individual tubes from bunching up,
you have a couple of possible approaches:
 Coating the tubes: The nanotubes are typically functionalized (where
you covalently bond molecules called functional groups to the side
walls, allowing nanotubes to perform a desired function such as to dis-
perse better or attach to other large molecules), but applying this type
of coating does pose some risks — the nanotube’s unique structural and
electrical properties are sometimes negatively affected.
 Sonication: Here you suspend the nanotubes in a polymer solution and
bombard them with sound waves. That gives you the needed dispersion,
but lengthy sonication can damage the tube walls as well.
Zyvex Corporation found that wrapping the nanotubes with a polymer was a
pretty effective way to make sure the tubes dispersed evenly. For example,
you can use Poly(aryleneethynylene) molecules (PPEs), which do not wrap
completely around the nanotube; instead, they sit on one side, providing
what looks like a backbone (as you can see in Figure 5-2). PPE is a rigid poly-
mer that does not bend easily — it sits along the length of the nanotube.
Here’s where the “static cling” analogy comes into play: A weak, noncovalent
force (not a chemical bond — no electrons are shared) sticks the polymer to
the nanotubes, which keeps the tubes from bunching together. This noncova-
lent functionalization between tube and coating allows the nanotubes to dis-
perse evenly in a polymer without giving up their unique properties, like the
previously mentioned covalent functionalization sometimes does. Pretty slick
(so to speak). As an added bonus, PPE by itself provides unique physical,
optical, and electronic properties — stuff that can only help our nanotube.
88
Part II: Building a Better World with Nanomaterials 

By adding PPEs to the mix, you end up with single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs),
noncovalently functionalized so that each tube acts as a unit that reinforces
the fiber. You can then mix this PPE-SWNT in situ with a polymer matrix — in
this case, polystyrene, the well-known (inexpensive) hard plastic you find
molded into plastic drinking glasses and computer cases. What you get is
considerably strengthened plastic.
In situ is Latin for “in place,” meaning all components are thrown together
and mixed as opposed to some composites being added one step at a time or
as part of a layering process. Given the nanotube’s small size, you can proba-
bly guess the difficulty in isolating and combining them one at a time.
Percolate, percolate, percolate
We’ve got ourselves our own little PPE-SWNT building block (kindly provided
to us by Zyvex Corporation) just waiting for us to put it to use. Before we do
that, however, we’re going to take a coffee break — or at least get a little taste
of percolation theory. You may think of percolation when your morning cup
of coffee is arguing with the overwhelming need for an afternoon nap — but
in mathematics, percolation theory describes a connected network made from
a random arrangement.
A what and a what? Imagine, if you will, that you have a square piece of plas-
tic and you scoop out holes in the plastic following a fixed pattern. Each hole
is (potentially) electrically connected to every other hole. Now, you ran-
domly drop metal into the holes until you get a connecting network — a 
spanning cluster — from one end of the square to the other. This critical 
point — the point, in this example, where electric current spans from one end
of the plastic square to the other — is called the percolation threshold: the
ratio between how many metal drops are needed to form a connecting net-
work and the total number of holes in the plastic. It’s expressed as a percent-
age; the higher the percentage, the likelier the electrical connection — but
the lower the percentage, the less material needed. Figure 5-3 shows the criti-
cal route from start (S) to finish (F), indicating that 150 random metal drops,
landing in 150 of 253 possible holes (in other words, 59.29 percent of all pos-
sible holes) were enough to get a connection from one side to the other. The
percolation threshold for this two-dimensional example is therefore 59.29
percent.

Chapter 5: Adding Strength with Composites

Percolation theory is not limited to two dimensions. Think of a cube of plas-
tic with metal shavings suspended inside. Some of these metal shavings
touch; others don’t. A high concentration of metal shavings gives you a
greater chance of a conductive connection between opposing sides of a cube;
lower concentrations of metal shavings reduce that chance. But we’re talking
efficiency here: What we’re looking for is the lowest possible amount of metal
shavings that still provides a reliably connected network.
Enter our heroes — the noncovalently functionalized PPE-SWNTs. (Snappy
name, isn’t it?)
The folks at Zyvex and Michigan Tech found that by mixing these polymer-
wrapped nanotubes with polystyrene, they came up with a lightweight, highly
conductive plastic. Between 0.05 and 0.1 weight percent of SWNTs (roughly 1
gram of SWNTs for every 1000 grams of composite) produced an incredibly
low percolation threshold. Result: a conductive, polymer-based composite
utilizing hardly a smidgen of SWNTs.
The use of precious materials (SWNTs) went down; the conductivity went
way up. If 7 percent of the material’s weight is functionalized (wrapped)
SWNTs, you get 14 orders of magnitude (1014) — the conductivity of pure
polystyrene — and 5 orders of magnitude (105) — the conductivity of a
SWNT/polystyrene composite that doesn’t use PPE to wrap the nanotubes.
Clearly, adding PPE to the SWNTs markedly increased their ability to 
conduct.

Not convinced? Check out Figure 5-4, which shows the rapid rise in conduc-
tivity versus the SWNT mass fraction in percentage. This rapid rise in the per-
colation threshold shows that noncovalently functionalizing the SWNTs with
PPE increased the SWNT’s ability to disperse — which in turn gives the mate-
rial two new advantages:
 Better dissipation of electrostatic charges
 Electromagnetic shielding capabilities
Now for a real-world application: a better paint job. Electrostatic painting
makes paint adhere better to metals and plastics by first electrostatically
charging the paint particles and then grounding the part to be painted. When
applied, the paint particles are drawn in (electrostatically) to the part to be
painted — resulting in an even, cost-effective coat (little waste, not much
overcoat), which is very important to the automobile industry.
Dispersion is key to achieving good electrical conductivity with a low perco-
lation threshold. Noncovalently functionalizing the SWNTs with PPE aided in
this dispersion, and since we didn’t have to pile on the SWNTs to achieve the
necessary conductivity levels, we don’t disturb the host polymer’s other pre-
ferred physical properties (including how easily it can be processed). All in
all, it’s a basic improvement to a common (but very useful) process — a very
good thing, and a typical nano-solution.
The next example uses the same concept — nanotubes dispersed in a 
polymer — to emit light and display images.

Displaying images
There will come a time when flat-screen TVs will seem so last-year. (Next
year, perhaps?) New advances in display technology — whether for TVs, cell-
phone displays, or computer monitors — seem to be arriving every few
months. And many of those advances are being driven by two benefits nano-
technology promises to provide — lower energy consumption and higher 
picture resolution.
You may be asking yourself, “Why do I need such a high-resolution picture 
for watching my TV? I don’t want my friends to think I’m a technogeek.”
Although the entertainment industry can certainly benefit from sharper 
resolutions — it’s what a lot of consumers want — the medical industry will
need it most. A doctor’s prognosis is only as good as the equipment on which
he views your magnetic resonance image (MRI) — and there is certainly a lot
of consumer demand for correct medical prognoses.
Questioner that you are, you may be asking yourself, “Why do I need my dis-
play to be energy efficient?” You may have noticed that your PDA and cell-
phone displays go into a dark, standby mode — this is to save energy. It’d be
nice if the display never went off — and you’d still only have to charge your
cellphone once a month. You may ask yourself, “Why do I need my display 
to be lightweight?” Well, okay, maybe you won’t be asking yourself that 
question — but it does bring up a good point that may not be obvious: The
U.S. soldier lugs around 80 to 100 pounds of equipment — and they love light-
weight stuff. (Think about that next time you heft your 5-pound laptop.)
The Korean connection
So who out there in the real world is set to answer consumer demand for
high-resolution, energy-efficient, lightweight display equipment? How about
Samsung? The Korean electronics giant — prominent as a maker of display
screens — has incorporated carbon nanotubes into a working color screen.
As in a traditional television (the big, bulky kinds), the carbon nanotubes
shoot electrons at phosphors on a glass screen. (A phosphor is any material
that emits visible light when exposed to radiation — the red, green, and blue
colors that you see on your screen.) Unlike traditional TV picture tubes,
Samsung’s color screens are thin, lightweight, and don’t use much power.
In addition to the Korean giant, we want to highlight two smaller companies
that are utilizing nanotechnology for displays — in this case, electronic
paper: NTERA (which uses electrochromatic technology) and E Ink (which is
taking the microcapsules route). The next section spells out their two differ-
ent approaches.

The smarter the window . . .
It’s pretty easy to come up with a great marketing phrase for describing a
potential application of electrochromatics. In fact, here it is on a silver plat-
ter: smart windows. Imagine living in Houston, Texas, with bright summer
sunlight streaming into your high-rise condo. To “turn down the sun,” you 
flip a switch and your windows go from clear to gray to dark, allowing just
enough sunlight in to make your living room a comfortable environment — all
the light with little heat.
With that comfy image in mind, here’s how it all works: Electrochromatics
are materials that change color when energized by an electrical current.
Electricity starts a chemical reaction which then changes the properties 
of the material — so it either reflects or absorbs light. The electronics are
sandwiched into your glass window, as in Figure 5-5. At left in Figure 5-5, you
start off with light shining through the layers of glass. When you turn on the
electricity — prompted, perhaps, by the effects of a blazing Texan sun — a
reaction occurs and ions move from the ion-storage layer, through the ion-
conducting layer, and into the electrochromatic layer — and the glass turns
opaque (as shown at right in Figure 5-5). Turning off the electricity has the
reverse effect — the window becomes transparent again.
One of the nice things about using electrochromatics is that it’s tunable —
you’re not stuck with just light or dark; you can come up with whatever
shade of gray you want, simply by changing the amount of current you use.
Now, the setup you see in Figure 5-5 shows a window kept opaque by con-
stantly running electrical energy through it. Nice, but not the most energy-
efficient solution to the problem. This has led to electrochromatic window
designs that only require electricity to drive the initial change — changing
the window from light to dark or dark to light. Clearly (so to speak), this is
the route to go — lower power bills, less hassle, more efficiency. You know —
progress.
NTERA, an Irish company spawned from Dublin’s University College, figured
all this out and came up with a solution they call NanoChromatic Displays
(NCDs, for short). The NCD is based on the same concept as the electrochro-
matics just described — but it goes the extra mile into nanotech territory.
(They don’t call it NanoChromatic for nothing!) Given their nano size, they
have a large number of particles that can quickly switch on or off — impor-
tant for video and computing — but the display is also bi-stable: Each pixel
stays colored until actively turned off — no need for backlighting. Fast
switching and no backlighting mean low power consumption. The display is
easy to see from nearly any angle, and — here’s a blast from the past — it
uses titanium dioxide (the chemical that makes paper white) to ensure good
contrast.
93
Chapter 5: Adding Strength with Composites

E Ink, a company based in Cambridge, Massachusetts (Can you say, “MIT?”),
takes a different approach to electronic ink. Rather than touting nanochro-
matics, they’ve placed their bet on microcapsules. Figure 5-6 gives you 
the thumbnail sketch of what E Ink came up with. Each microcapsule has 
positively charged white particles and negatively charged black particles

sandwiched between two electrodes. Depending on the charge applied to the
bottom layer of the particle, you can get the microcapsule to represent a
black (-), gray (-/+), or white dot (+). Zap the layers with the appropriate elec-
tric charge and you come up with black text on a white background (or even
a grayscale image).
E Ink also touts the key buzzwords — high contrast, low power. However,
their microcapsules suffer from slow switching speeds that may limit their
application breadth. NTERA may also have an edge on E Ink’s production
methods — they can utilize existing LCD manufacturing plants and equip-
ment, whereas E Ink may have to start with a custom-designed plant.
Lightening the Load with Nanofibers
Fibers can be used as a backbone to many composites. Now, we’ve been tout-
ing the benefits in this chapter of making composites out of nano-scale mater-
ial, but it’s time to let you in on a little secret — when we talk about making
nanofibers, we’re not talking about some radical new process destined to win
the two of us our own personal Nobel Prizes (though we can dream). The
processing methods we describe in this section have been used before —
they’re time-tested. Not that we aren’t proud of these processes. They’re way
cool — carbon nanotube fibers are especially close to Rich’s heart (they’re
the main focus of his research at Rice University). Beyond cool, however, is in
how they show reliable, known methods (that we know work well) being put
to new ends. Read on.

Nanotubes
No one nowadays can argue with the fact that carbon nanotubes hold great
promise in the making of materials with superior mechanical, electrical, and
thermal properties. The trick is getting this promise to realize itself as prod-
ucts that better our lives — and provide a return for those who invested in
the promise. One method of finessing this trick — namely, of capitalizing 
on the superior mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties of carbon 
nanotubes — is to use them to hot-rod some materials. For example, you can
form a composite by spinning the carbon nanotubes into a fiber that is then
inserted into a matrix. (The “Compose This!” section, earlier in this chapter,
has more on the mechanics of creating composites.)
Creating a spun fiber to be used in a composite is not new: body armor used
by the military has long been comprised of Kevlar, a polymer-based fiber; air-
frames and sports equipment utilize carbon fiber (and carbon makes a tough,
flexible, useful fiber). The uses of carbon fiber have been increasing whereas
the cost is decreasing — which in turn leads to even more uses for carbon
fiber. (Figure 5-7 illustrates, in graphic terms, this perversion of the Law of
Supply and Demand — here, the more the demand, the lower the price.)
Initially, in the 1970s, only the aerospace industry capitalized on carbon fiber,
but this trend moved into the sporting-goods industry in the mid-’80s and
continues into the industrial and automotive industries. Carbon fibers may
also play an important role in energy storage (fuel cells) and the generation
of power (wind turbines).

Part II: Building a Better World with Nanomaterials 

That’s all fine and dandy for traditional carbon fibers, but will a carbon nano-
tube fiber show similar trends? That will all depend upon whether carbon
nanotube fibers are seen as an economically viable alternative to current
fibers. If a carbon nanotube fiber has good conductive and thermal proper-
ties, has 100 times the mechanical strength of carbon fiber, and you can pro-
duce it at a comparable production cost, then carbon nanotube fiber is sure to
replace carbon fiber for particular applications.
We’ve been stressing strength as a major benefit of carbon nanotube fibers,
but the most exciting applications may not necessarily need raw strength.
Coming up with an incredibly strong, lightweight conductive wire would
greatly impact energy distribution, for example. (Chapter 9 has more on
carbon nanotubes and energy uses.) “Armchair quantum wire” — again, see
Chapter 4 — could be used to shuttle electrons around with little resistance,
an application which, like carbon fiber, is sure to see its first applications
with space vehicles. (After all, lugging all that copper — the traditional mate-
rial for low-resistance wire — up into space gets pretty expensive.) Clearly,
finding a lightweight, durable, energy-efficient alternative to traditional wires
not only would help our space endeavors, but also could boost the creation
of more fuel-efficient cars and other everyday items.
We think the sky’s the limit here, and we want to share our enthusiasm. In the
next section, we walk you through one challenge of developing a carbon nan-
otube fiber.
What a tangled web we weave
If you flip over to Chapter 4, you’ll see considerable page real estate devoted
to ways people have divined for coming up with carbon nanotubes. Such
methods result in a black, fluffy material — the nanotubes have intertwined
and knotted together. (Kind of like that ball of twine that always gets unrav-
eled in the kitchen drawer and takes forever to untangle.)
Tangled knots of stuff definitely have their uses — we’re partial to fettuccine
Alfredo ourselves — but a major goal of nanotechnology is to use existing
industrial techniques to manipulate atoms and molecules in bulk to make a
large, atomically perfect, usable structure. And tangled knots of stuff do not
always produce the most usable structures. This fact has led some to con-
clude that the first order of business, if you’re working with carbon nano-
tubes, is alignment — getting all those nanotubes to line up in the same 
direction.
Why is alignment, of all things, number one on anyone’s list of things to get
done? Imagine the following scenario: If you take a plastic drinking straw and
hold it at the ends, you can pull and push on the ends of the straw all you
want, but it’s going to take some real effort to get the straw to deform.
However, if you take your finger and poke the straw from the side, the straw
easily buckles and bends. Now, the same thing is going to happen if you have
97
Chapter 5: Adding Strength with Composites

a bunch of aligned straws — the force needed to stretch or compress the
group of straws is quite considerable compared to the force needed to simply
bend the group of straws. Bottom line: Aligned tubes are stronger along their
length.
Now imagine carbon nanotubes, our “nanostraws,” aligned in a fiber. The
fiber will have great strength when you pull — it’s like trying to pull those
bundle of straws but instead you’re pulling carbon nanotubes. This fiber will
not be rigid and flexible, so compression and bending at the macro scale
won’t be a factor causing it to break. Our main structural benefit is gained
when pulling the fiber. (If you take a look at Chapter 2, we go through the
development of Kevlar, a polymer based fiber. We point out that the polymer
molecules are aligned in the same direction — same goes for our carbon nano-
tubes. This is an example of using a time-tested approach to continue to
develop and manipulate at the nano scale.)
Alignment is also important for our “Armchair Quantum Wire.” With aligned
carbon nanotubes, we can shuttle electrons down the center of them with
very little resistance, making our very conductive wire possible.
Getting all our nanofiber ducks in a row means that we end up with a fiber
that has a ridiculously high tensile strength. “How high?” you might ask.
Check out Table 5-2, which gives the tensile strength and density for common
materials in increasing order, from wimpy to muscle-bound. (Note that even
though glass fiber is “stronger” than Kevlar, it weighs one gram more per
cubic centimeter. Our goal is a fiber that is both strong and lightweight,
which is why Kevlar is so popular.) Now compare the carbon-nanotube mate-
rial — it has a huge tensile strength and a density comparable to that of
carbon fiber. (Okay, these values for the carbon nanotube are theoretical but
there’s experimental data to support this.)
Tensile strength in Table 5-2 is measured in Pascals (Pa), a unit of pressure.
“GPa” is GigaPascal — one billion Pascals. For good measure, we threw in a
column comparing the elasticity of the different materials, since elasticity is a
property we consider desirable in a fiber. Elasticity here is denoted by
Young’s modulus — a value that describes how well a fiber can withstand
great strain (pulling) and great stress (forces applied at a particular area).
Note that carbon nanotubes have a Young’s modulus comparable to dia-
monds (also made of carbon). See Chapter 4 for further explanation of
Young’s modulus and carbon nanotube’s structural properties.

Clothes make the man
Body armor — the stuff humans have wrapped around themselves in 
hopes that it would protect them from the slings and arrows of outrageous
fortune — has always taken advantage of new technology. When man first
started hunting, they would cover their bodies with leather. As societies
formed and fought one another, metal production advanced from bronze to
iron and body armor progressed accordingly, so that chain mail and metal
plates came into fashion. As weapons got better (in particular, guns), the
metal plates got thicker and heavier. Finally, in 1881, Dr. George Emery
Goodfellow, after examining a gunned-down man, noted that a bullet had
pierced the man’s flesh and broken his ribs but had not harmed the silk hand-
kerchief the man carried. This led to Goodfellow’s study of the case, intrigu-
ingly entitled “Notes on the Impenetrability of Silk to Bullets.”
Not that we’re suggesting silk as the body armor of the future, but you can
see the beginning of the story here, one that reached a high point in the late
1960s when DuPont developed Kevlar, a strong polymer fiber currently used
in bulletproof vests. Kevlar is five times stronger than steel of the same
weight, which doesn’t seem to make much sense until one realizes that the
key to bulletproof vests is dispersing the energy of the bullet over a wide area.
This is similar to what happens when you hit a soccer ball into a goal — the
net backing absorbs the energy of the ball, dispersing it over a wide area. The
Kevlar fibers are also interlaced — when the bullet hits a horizontal fiber,
that fiber pulls on every interlaced vertical fiber. Additionally, each vertical
fiber continues to push on each subsequent horizontal fiber. This allows the
entire sheet of Kevlar to absorb the energy of the bullet, regardless of where
the bullet actually hits. (Figure 5-8 shows a cross section of a bulletproof
vest. Note the interlaced Kevlar fibers sandwiched together.)
99
Chapter 5: Adding Strength with Composites

Now, as technology progresses, you can expect stronger fibers to emerge
replacing Kevlar. Spider silk — yes, spider silk — is considered by many to be
an up-and-comer in this field. Although spider silk involves biotechnology
more than nanotechnology per se, scientists at Nexia Biotechnologies are
breeding genetically engineered goats to produce milk high in spider silk pro-
teins. This is then spun into a fiber — baptized with the name Biosteel —
which can be 20 times stronger than an equivalent strand of steel.
Nanotechnology is set to one-up biotechnology with carbon nanotube fibers.
Carbon nanotubes promise to be even stronger than Biosteel — 100 times
stronger than steel! With a perfect carbon nanotube fiber, chained together
with no loss of strength, you could lift an automobile with a piece as thin as
sewing thread. That’s some strong stuff. And bulletproof vests are not the
only applications for carbon nanotubes. Weaving nanotube fibers in with
those in existing clothes can become a way to store energy (like a battery),
which could then power various electrical devices and sensors to monitor
human vital signs. The possibilities are endless.
Speaking of clothes and nanofibers (and, very loosely, a composite), Eddie
Bauer and Dockers have embraced Nano-Tex’s spill-resistant fabric. You may
have seen the commercials with the clumsy guy spilling wine all over his
pants, but instead of the wine leaving a nasty stain, it beads and rolls right
off, “like water off a duck’s back” as Nano-Tex’s Web site states. Nano-Tex
gives very little insight into how they incorporate their spill-resistant technol-
ogy (something about intellectual property), but we suspect they coat the
fibers with a specific polymer. Since the fibers are coated and integrated into
the fabric’s weave, the cloth maintains its resistance even after many

washes — not to mention allowing the fabric to maintain its soft texture and
feel. Other technologies that Nano-Tex lays claim to involve a quick-drying
cloth (whisks away moisture so you feel cooler) and a cloth that feels just like
cotton (but is really a synthetic that maintains color, durability, and wrinkle-
resistance but still feels soft). A word to the wise: Be sure that you’re actually
wearing your “Stain Defender” Dockers before you intentionally spill red wine
on yourself while chatting around the buffet table at the office Christmas
party in hopes of impressing your co-workers. Rich learned that the hard way.
Clemson University researchers have also integrated a polymer film mixed
with silver nanoparticles to produce a “self-cleaning” coating for clothes. This
coating is infused into the fabric, creating a series of microscopic bumps that
cause dirt to bounce off when water is applied. This is different than other
water-repellent materials like Teflon because this film is integrated into the
fabric, not applied as an additional layer to the fabric — allowing it to last
longer. Also, the particles are too small to be seen since their size is smaller
than the wavelength of light. Outdoor items, such as convertible car tops and
lawn furniture, are sure to take advantage of this nanomaterial — just imagine
being able to simply hose something down and wipe it off. Additionally, the
need for less detergent could help our environment.
Put it all together and what do we have? Self-cleaning, wrinkle-resistant, bul-
letproof clothes that keep us cool in even the most tropical of climes —
something Q would be proud to offer James Bond.
Putting nanofibers to use: 
Into the wild blue yonder
With increasing oil prices, airplane makers are looking to lightweight 
composites — lighter planes use less fuel getting off the ground, cutting
down on operation costs. Airframes currently use carbon fiber for some com-
ponent parts, greatly reducing the weight. The fiber is woven in much the
same way as Kevlar vests (described in the previous section) — with the
fiber aligned with the direction of high stress. More or less fiber gets used
depending on the amount of stress in a particular direction. The leftmost
drawing in Figure 5-9 shows an even distribution of stress.
The central drawing in Figure 5-9 shows more stress along the vertical access,
resulting in more fibers in that general direction. The rightmost drawing in
Figure 5-9 shows the situation where there is high stress in the vertical and
diagonal direction but less in the horizontal direction. All in all, we are opti-
mizing the composite to give the most amount of strength with the least
amount of fiber, thus lowering the weight of the entire system. These fibers
may one day also sense and respond to stresses — imagine an airplane’s wing
sensing the stresses upon it and responding — by either deforming to reduce
stress or becoming more rigid to handle the stress. (The “Sensing strain” sec-
tion, later in this chapter, addresses these possibilities in a bit more detail.)
101
Chapter 5: Adding Strength with Composites

One of Rich’s favorite novels, Arthur C. Clarke’s The Fountains of Paradise,
describes a space elevator very much like Jack’s beanstalk — an elevator
climbing a cable that reaches far into space. In Clarke’s novel, the cable sup-
posedly contains a microscopically thin but incredibly strong “hyperfila-
ment” derived from diamond as the main component. Clarke later identified
another form of carbon, the buckyball (named after Buckminster Fuller), as
the potential hyperfilament.
The space elevator is not a new concept. In 1895, the Russian space visionary
Konstantin Tsiolkovsky imagined a 22,000-mile-high tower that would top out
at a point in geosynchronous orbit around Earth. A space elevator replaces
the tower with a cable; a mass at its end keeps it taut against gravity by
revolving around Earth at orbital speed, outside the atmosphere. During the
1960s space race, the Russian Yuri Artsutanov also developed the idea. What
is new is the proposed main element in the composition of the elevator’s
track — what material could be strong enough to withstand the winds and
debris constantly hitting taut cable that long? This is where the carbon nano-
tube comes in.
During the summer of 2004, Discover magazine and Scientific American
explored tethers in space. The Discover article followed aerospace engineer
Brad Edwards’s trek towards a feasible space elevator, which had Edwards
identifying a carbon nanotube/polymer composite fiber as the backbone of
the cable. The cable is set to extend from a refurbished oil-drilling platform to
a distance of 62,000 miles out, where it ends in a counterweight. Ascent vehi-
cles would then ride the cable out into space, dropping payload costs to $100
per pound (as opposed to NASA’s current $10,000 per pound).
But why confine the benefits to Earth? The Scientific American article also
illustrates how a tether between two space outposts could give them both
artificial gravity. Figure 5-10 shows such a rotating system: Two capsules are
attached at opposite ends of a tether and spun; the outward force that pulls
the tether taut acts like artificial gravity for the inhabitants. The article also
mentions that a tether could be used to slow down decommissioned satel-
lites so they burn more completely as they fall out of orbit — reducing space
debris.

Okay, even though Discover and Scientific American are reputable journals,
we’re sure our description here has left you with a few questions. As in:
 Is this feasible? Maybe. Maybe not. It depends on whether going into
space becomes enough of a priority to make developing this space ele-
vator practical. If so, it will be done — and nanotechnology will play a
role in its development. Creating a strong enough cable is the crux of a
successful space elevator; nanotechnology can create fibers that are
stronger and cheaper — probably enough so to withstand the forces
that make this concept work. Clarke pinpoints when it can all happen:
“About 50 years after everyone stops laughing.”

 Is this practical? Economics will be the driving force. The International
Space Station will need 77 metric tons of booster propellant over its ten-
year lifespan, at a cost of roughly $1.2 billion, just to keep it in orbit.
Decreasing the cost per pound to $100 from $10,000 is a great motivator.
Then again, what’s so great about space? It’s just that, space — empty
space (if you ignore all those planets, stars, comets, asteroids, and such
that zoom around in it). Now to the next question . . .
 Why do we constantly want to go into space? The original motivation
behind the space race was national security — whoever could deliver a
nuclear weapon to an opponent first would win, and the quickest route
to your opponent would be through space. Now, corporations have
begun to occupy space . . . and we’re not talking about Planet Starbucks
or the Microsoft Galaxy. Imagery satellites are used for surveying — and
some can definitely determine what’s beneath the earth. (Can you say
diamonds, gold, and oil?) The global positioning system (GPS) not only
helps land planes but keeps marriages together when the guy refuses to
ask for directions. Even telecommunications will continue to rely on
space as our global economy continues to grow. Space tourism may be
just over the horizon; after SpaceShip One claimed the $10 million
Ansari X-Prize in 2004, Sir Richard Branson was impressed enough to
“launch” Virgin Galactic, a spinoff from his giant Virgin group of compa-
nies. Perhaps solar satellites will beam energy back to Earth. There are
plenty of motivations, some identified and others yet to be dreamed.
And the dreamers are already busy.
Raising the Bar with Smart Materials
Smart materials are materials that can sense or react to their environments.
In this section, we highlight metals and plastics that respond to change by
moving, some new sensors that are smaller than ever before, and composites
that actually fix themselves — and all this is just the first step. The second
step is more along the lines of the liquid-metal robot from Terminator 2. Okay,
maybe not this year, but it certainly would be cool . . . as long we can pro-
gram out that inconvenient homicidal-mayhem business.
Coming back to normal
Shape memory composites are materials that retain their original shape no
matter how bent out of shape they get. An example of shape memory metal
(but not necessarily a type of composite) would be the Flexon eyeglasses uti-
lizing Nitinol, a Nickel (Ni) and Titanium (Ti) alloy developed by the Naval
Ordnance Laboratory (NOL) in the early 1960s. (Get it? Ni-Ti-NOL = Nitinol.)
This composite has been incorporated into eyeglass frames — even after a
user twists them, bends them, or even sits on them, the frames (almost
104
Part II: Building a Better World with Nanomaterials 

always) come back to their original shape. It’s one small example of a com-
mercially viable product that comes from military and NASA research (and
there are hundreds). Shape-memory composites come in two flavors: metallic
(alloy) and polymer.
Better living through SMAs
Nitinol is an example of what we call a shape-memory alloy, or SMA. SMAs
have two properties that make them what they are:
 Pseudo-elasticity: Is an SMA elastic? Not quite, but sort of. This quality
is the rubberlike “give” that every SMA has.
 Shape memory: This is an effect of the mechanical energy stored in the
SMA when it’s reconfigured and cooled. The stored energy is what
returns the SMA to its original shape when heated, even if it’s been
severely deformed.
Now, these SMAs go through what is called a solid-state phase change. You
may remember phase changes from high-school experiments with water —
water changes its phases at different temperatures like so many changes of
clothing, going from a solid (ice) to a liquid (water) to a gas (water vapor).
SMAs are similar because the molecules do in fact rearrange, but they differ
in that their molecules remain closely packed, causing the substance to
remain as a solid (thus the qualifying adjective solid state).
Figure 5-11 illustrates the difference in molecular structure at each phase as
an SMA deforms and reforms. Starting at the lower left, the SMA is in its origi-
nal form and room temperature state. Applying a load makes the molecules
deform. We then remove the load — after adding a bit of heat, the molecules
become rigid and form a tight structure. After this tight structure cools natu-
rally and no additional load is applied, the molecules relax, forming a differ-
ent lattice structure but still maintaining their general molecular orientation
and macro-scale physical structure.
SMAs, like many things in life, have their advantages and disadvantages:
 The good news:
SMAs are biocompatible — human bodies won’t reject implants or
other materials made of SMAs.
SMAs have admirable mechanical properties. (In other words,
they’re strong and corrosion-resistant.)
 The bad news:
SMAs are expensive to manufacture.
SMAs have poor fatigue properties — a steel component lasts a
hundred load cycles longer under the same loading conditions.
105
Chapter 5: Adding Strength with Composites

You’re probably thinking that SMAs may be great for the eyeglass-frames
industry, but what’s in it for those of us with 20/20 vision? We can only say
that SMAs have already been incorporated into many applications currently
in use. If your ears pricked up at the mention of SMA’s biocompatibility, you
won’t be surprised to hear that SMAs are used in many medical applications,
including many associated with reconstructive surgery.
As part of our continuing effort to provide real-world examples of why nano-
tech matters, imagine if you will the following scenario: You’ve had a slight
altercation with the basement door, one dark and stormy night, and walk
away with a busted jaw. You are fully aware that bone plates are used to hold
facial bones together during reconstruction, but you are also aware that
when a steel plate is used and attached, the bones may initially be correctly
compressed to speed up the healing process — but the necessary tension is
quickly lost. That’s a problem; it means that the fracture is no longer under
compression — and that slows down the healing process considerably. A
technologically proficient doctor explains to you that when an SMA plate is
used instead of steel (as in Figure 5-12), the plate is initially cooled (it’s
deformable to a certain extent), is attached to the break, and — as body heat
raises the temperature of the SMA — it contracts, applying sustained pres-
sure to help healing. Now which plate would you opt for: steel or SMA?
We wish this was a done deal, but problems do arise in designing SMA plates
to apply the appropriate pressure — for example, how to manipulate the SMA
composition so it gives us the “pull” strength required? Well, that’s where
nanotechnology comes in (manipulating individual atoms in compositions),
but more research needs to be done to provide a real and practical solution.

Part II: Building a Better World with Nanomaterials 

As for other real-world applications, think aerospace and robotics. Airplane
maneuverability depends on moving the flaps at the trailing edge of the wing,
as shown on the left side of Figure 5-13. The current way to do this is to use
pressure and hydraulics, a process requiring constant maintenance. Using
SMAs, we can “warp” the wing instead, as shown on the right side of Fig-
ure 5-13, removing the need for hydraulics — which also removes their addi-
tional weight and maintenance. SMAs can also be used to mimic human 
muscles. Instead of waddling around like C3-PO (did you ever see him move
his fingers?), robots will utilize SMAs to move their limbs because SMAs are
strong, compact, and provide a fluid, lifelike movement. Additional applica-
tions include vascular stents (tubing to hold open blood vessels) and even
cellphone antennas (bendable yet durable and recoverable).
The SMP connection
We couldn’t close this section without at least mentioning SMPs (that’s shape-
memory polymers to you newbies out there). SMPs have their own attractive
qualities — they have the capacity to recover from large strains, for example.
SMPs operate slightly differently than their metallic cousins. The polymer is
raised past a certain temperature, deformed into the desired position, and
then allowed to cool. It retains this deformed shape until heat is again reap-
plied past a specific temperature.

107
Chapter 5: Adding Strength with Composites

There are currently a few downsides to using the polymers over the metals:
They are not as strong during constriction, and not as stiff when in place.
Figure 5-14 shows an SEM image of two nano-composite shape-memory poly-
mer beams. Researchers at the University of Colorado, in conjunction with
Composite Technology Development, Inc., have introduced SiC (silicon and
carbon) molecules into the polymer that correct some of these problems.
They note that increasing the SiC content till it’s 40 percent of the polymer’s
weight increases the material’s recovery strength and recovery time. This is
just another example of nano-scale manipulation — controlling molecules
and guaranteeing dispersion — strengthening composites at the molecular
level. Applications include Biological MicroElectroMechanical Systems
(BioMEMS) — therapeutic medical devices for minimally invasive surgery
(imagine tiny gadgets gripping and releasing things inside blood vessels).
Sensing strain
Sensing strain in structures is important for many reasons. Identifying a prob-
lem early in the structure’s lifespan could greatly reduce not only the cost
and time associated with the repair but could also reduce any potential loss
of life from a possible accident. The trick has been figuring out the best way
to monitor strain.

pages 5115-5126, Copyright (2002), with permission from Elsevier.)
There’s a multitude of ways to use nanotech to sense strain in a structure —
but presently they’re mostly restricted to the laboratory. It’s easy to measure
the load on an airplane wing in a controlled environment, but how do you
measure those same stresses when you’re out flying in a blizzard? Bridges
and airplanes undergo a variety of stresses while doing their jobs, whether
from carrying a great load or withstanding various weather conditions. Oil-
drilling equipment (yes, back to energy) could use nanosensors to monitor
the drill bit in real time as it digs — instantly detecting and reporting the
stresses resulting from high temperatures and pressures. In the oil world, the
cost of having to stop and repair drilling machinery can be immense — espe-
cially for offshore rigs — if a fracture in a pipe is not detected early.
The key is to incorporate the sensor into the actual structure — that way
measuring the environment’s impact in real time is just another thing the
material does (so to speak) automatically. Incorporating nanosensors into a
composite is certainly one way to solve this problem. That’s great stuff, but
think how much greater it would be if the sensor also invoked an action —
imagine a bridge that reacted to a greater load by becoming “stronger” where
it needed to be, or an airplane that optimized its own shape to reduce drag.
Already composites are used in bulletproof vests that harden when they’re
struck with great pressure.

Chapter 5: Adding Strength with Composites

Ideally, we want our sensors embedded in composites that would not only
“sense” but also reinforce our composite. The result would be a material
that’s not only “smart” but also stronger and lighter. Now, the real trick is not
only to get a nano-size sensor incorporated into a composite but also to
avoid damaging the integrity of the entire composite itself. We describe (ear-
lier in the chapter) how important the matrix/fiber interface is — and any
defect (or foreign substance) within a composite can propagate weaknesses
and destroy the system. Some nano-size sensors and concepts are presently
possible and worth noting: carbon nanotubes, fiber optics, and superfine
magnetic wires.
Carbon copies
The first strain sensor in our potential bag of tricks consists of our old
standby, carbon nanotubes. Carbon nanotubes change their electronic prop-
erties and resonant frequency when subjected to strains. The easiest way to
understand this is to imagine a Chinese finger cuff. As you put in your fingers
and pull in opposing directions, the finger cuff gets tighter. The same is true
for carbon nanotubes — bending, twisting, or flattening changes their electri-
cal properties — which in turn can be measured. Work done at Rice University
affixed “buckypaper” (a disoriented network of carbon nanotubes formed
into a flat sheet) to a brass plate. When they stretched the brass plate, they
measured the change in voltage across the buckypaper. This voltage change
correlated to measurable stresses induced on the brass plate.
Another experiment at the University of Delaware measured the change in
resonant frequency of a carbon nanotube. Think of plucking a guitar string
and hearing the pitch rise as you stretch the string. Now, if we pull on a
carbon nanotube, the frequency at which the nanotube naturally vibrates will
change in much the same way. The change tells you something about what’s
happening to the tube. Imagine, for instance, a bridge that (in effect) says
“ouch” when it’s under unusual stress.
Both of these approaches show the importance of carbon nanotubes in com-
posites, sensors, and materials that are both composites and sensors. (See
Chapter 8 on the role nanotubes can play in chemical sensors and Chapter 10
for biological sensors.)
Trip the light fantastic
Another strain sensor we should mention incorporates fiber optics — glass
fibers that can send multiple wavelengths of light along them. (Fiber optics
have long been used in the telecommunications industry, where they’re
mass-produced at low cost.) The sensor version of fiber optics — known as a
Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensor — enables a material to register stress in
real time. Such a material incorporates different grating sizes throughout
each fiber. Each grating reflects a specific wavelength of light back to a detec-
tor in the light emitter.
110
Part II: Building a Better World with Nanomaterials 

This particular grating is like the ones you see over sewer pipes — it’s made
of slits. Any physical change to these slits (say, by stretching the grating or
making it expand or contract with a temperature change) can cause a notice-
able change in wavelength. When these wavelengths change, a stress is
recorded — which makes this a pretty good system for telling you when a
bridge is about to buckle, or that the gale-force winds outside are about to
tear the roof off your five-star hotel.
There are three main advantages of the FBG: It requires no electricity, just
light along the fiber — no electricity means no possibility of electromagnetic
interference by other sensors; the fiber can be incorporated into a compos-
ite; and the fiber can be used to measure temperature, pressure, and strain.
Copper: Not just for pennies anymore
We’re going to close this section with an old friend — copper wire. It turns
out that coating a copper wire with interspersed magnetic coatings creates a
wire that can sense strain much the same way the Fiber Bragg Grating does.
Figure 5-15 shows a magnetic coating surrounding the copper wire at differ-
ent increments. The magnetic coating controls the wire’s impedance — the
degree to which the wire resists the flow of electricity — much the same way
as a resistor does. As the magnetic coating is stretched, the impedance
changes — and the current is measured. This sensor has two advantages
over the FBG — small size and low cost — but it does require electricity, and
that can mean electromagnetic interference that may impede other systems.
Heal thyself
If you’re familiar with Greek mythology, you already know that even a hero
can have a weakness. A composite’s Achilles’ heel is the interface where the
fiber meets the matrix that holds the fiber. If the fiber ever separates from 
the matrix, microcracks occur inside the composite and begin to spread,

weakening the entire structure. (Such microcracks can result from tempera-
ture changes or the pressures of mechanical loading.) As you can imagine, it’s
very difficult to detect and repair cracks within the composite. (You have to
call in the big guns — ultrasonics, infrared thermography, and X-ray tomogra-
phy.) Usually, when a crack is detected, a resin is injected through an access
hole to fill the cracks.
Scientists at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign have demon-
strated a unique self-healing composite. It involves dispersing microcapsules
and catalysts within the composite. When the catalyst comes in contact with
the healing agent inside the microcapsule, the healing agent polymerizes and
hardens. Figure 5-16 illustrates this process.
Here a crack forms on the left (i), penetrating the microcapsules, which break
and fill the crack with the healing agent (ii). As the crack gets bigger, it even-
tually comes in contact with — and consumes — the catalyst, which then
polymerizes the healing agent in the crack (iii). The healing efficiency for the
self-healing composite was 50 percent at room temperature and 80 percent at
176°F. This may not be perfect, but the concept shows promise and may
become more effective in various ways:
 Finding the best percentage of catalyst and microcapsules for the con-
centration
 Increasing the dispersion of healing agent
 Attaching the catalyst to the surface of the fiber or the microcapsule
itself
At this point, a few sticky questions come to mind:
 Will the microcapsules and catalysts introduce their own flaws, 
similar to those found in our original fiber/matrix interface? It’s 
possible — and the interfaces where the matrix meets the microcapsule
and the catalyst can also be weak points in the material’s structural
integrity. Of the two, however, the fiber-meets-matrix interface is the
more important one in the composite. It’s where the energy of stress is
transferred from the composite through the matrix and onto the fiber
backbone — a vital point in the structure. The microcapsules and cata-
lysts may not experience the same stress-transfer problem that the
fiber/matrix does.
 Will the “polymerized healing agent” also create a flaw? It could.
However, the spherical shape of the microcapsules will disperse the
energy. During World War II, when a crack developed on an airplane
wing, they’d drill holes at both ends of the crack to prevent the crack
from propagating. This disperses the energy so the crack won’t get 
any bigger. The microcapsules’ spherical shape acts in much the same
way — dispersing the energy over a larger area so it isn’t concentrated
at a single point. Figure 5-17 shows a cartoonish idea of this concept.
112
Part II: Building a Better World with Nanomaterials 

 If dispersing the energy is only effective half the time, what happens
if the crack grows again? This is definitely a problem. Composites get
used in high-stress environments where they undergo constant and
repetitive stresses. Therefore, the probability is high that cracks will
occur in the same places more than once. One answer: More — but
smaller — microcapsules. More study is needed to see if this option is
viable for composites in the future.

Lots. Nanotechnology is (or soon will be) making comput-
ers more powerful, speeding up the delivery of data, light-
ing our way, and producing energy.
In this part, we explore uses of nanotechnology in com-
puter memory and semiconductor applications; telecom-

“I am putting myself to the fullest possible use, which is all I think that any
conscious entity can ever hope to do.”
HAL 9000, computer from 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)
H
AL 9000 was the central computer for the spaceship in 2001: A Space
Odyssey, the Stanley Kubrick film based on a story by Arthur C. Clarke.
In the language of the movie, HAL supposedly stood for “Heuristically pro-
grammed ALgorithmic computer.” Heuristics and algorithms are central to
defining intelligence: learning by self-discovery (heuristic) and methodical
problem-solving (algorithmic). HAL, besides running amok and seizing con-
trol of the spacecraft, is a central character in the film, a “conscious entity.”
Which leads to an intriguing question: How can a computer be conscious —
self-aware — hip to its own existence?
Human technology is traditionally a quest to make life easier — from inventing
the wheel (to aid mobility) to creating the computer (to solve complicated
calculations). Take a look around you and you’ll notice that humankind’s
innovative bent has accelerated of late — particularly in the computer indus-
try. It seems a new computer processor crops up every year that outdates the
last one by leaps and bounds. These faster processors may one day create an
advanced computer, one capable of working alongside humans, helping us make
important decisions — similar to HAL without all the running amok stuff.
To a large extent, the computer’s processing ability relies upon the size of the
device — the smaller the device, the better. Not only does the smaller size
speed up computer processing, it also allows greater portability — after all,
where would laptops, PDAs, and cellphones be without fast computing power
and small size? As our demands increase for faster and more easily portable
computing power, so does our demand for smaller and smaller computer
chips. At the same time that we want our processors smaller, we want them

to perform more functions and consume less power. But there’s a physical
limit on how small a chip can be when we use our current top-down manufac-
turing techniques. Heat dissipation and electronic interference are also big
hurdles that prevent us from going smaller.
There’s also a practical limit on how much money goes into creating a spe-
cialized facility to make those tiny chips. These days, the sticker shock is get-
ting absurdly large, compared to the cost benefit — but traditional methods
of mass production simply won’t pass muster. New methods of designing
computer chips are needed — and are being explored. Of course, if you
assume that smaller is definitely better, the next step’s almost a no-brainer:
Nanotechnology will lead the way to “smarter” computers that will one day
have enough tiny, super-capable circuits to “think.” Hey, it could make our
lives easier — we think.
Linking the Brain with the Computer
It’s not as if computers came from some obscure corner of the ninth 
dimension — their models are actually pretty close to home. If you look at
computers just a tad sideways, you’d see that there’s a pretty explicit link
between the way computers work and the way our brains work. A computer
relies on binary symbols — 1s and 0s — because they correspond to the two
states of a switch: either on or off. These 1s and 0s can be combined to solve
problems — whether they’re as complex as the simulation of a nuclear explo-
sion or as mundane as determining the color that a pixel represents on your
screen. Our brain contains cells called neurons that store information in the
form of electronic pulses and communicate with other neurons in the brain
and throughout the body by sending various chemicals. To a certain degree,
these electrical pulses (known as action potentials) can be thought of as an
“on” switch — the electrical equivalent of a 1 in binary. Before we get too
excited about such parallels, however, it might be useful to pause for a
moment and break down some size comparisons.
This brain/computer comparison is meant to be taken lightly. The brain is
certainly more complex, relying as it does on “weighted” signals. In other
words, the stronger the connection between two neurons, the more influence
(more weight) it has on the resulting calculation. Also, the brain is a bit fuzzy
and signals are not necessarily “on” or “off” — there’s a lot of gray area in
that gray matter. Customarily, computers do their work in precise units of
measurement:
 bit (b): A single binary digit representing either a 1 or a 0. Transfer rates
in computer networks are described in terms of bits per second.
• megabit (Mbit): One million bits (1,000,000 bits)
• gigabit (Gbit): One billion bits (1,000,000,000 bits)
118
Part III: “Smarter” Computers! Faster Internet! Cheaper Energy! 

 byte (B): Eight bits — referred to when describing units of storage in
computers.
• megabyte (MB): One million bytes or eight million bits.
• gigabyte (GB): One billion bytes (1,000,000,000 bytes)
• terabyte (TB): One trillion bytes (1,000,000,000,000 bytes)
We rounded the bits and bytes here for simplicity. Since we’re dealing with
binary, we use bit-and-byte sizes rounded to the closest power of two. For
example, a megabit actually has 220 (or 1,048,576) bits instead of the rounded
1,000,000 bits we just described.
If you’ve been around any computer at all during the past few years or so,
you’ve heard this bit-and-byte-and-megabyte stuff countless times. But have
you recently thought at all about what you’ve been carrying around inside
your brain in terms of “storage units”? Here are the (amazing) facts. There
are about 100 billion neurons in a human brain, each with a thousand 
connections — resulting in 100 trillion connections, all capable of simultane-
ous calculation — extreme parallel processing, in other words. (Parallel 
processing is where you simultaneously execute the same task on multiple
processors.)
To put this in perspective, imagine that one of your friendly Nanotechnology
For Dummies authors has some laundry to do. (Not too hard to imagine . . .
Rich has been a little lazy . . . had a bit of work to do — say, writing a book in
his spare time — but now his clothes are beginning to reek a bit . . . bad for
his mojo.) Late for his hot date, he takes his laundry and a handful of quar-
ters to the laundromat next door. Rich sorts (yes, he sorts) and distributes
his laundry into three machines — one for lights, one for darks, and one for
dress clothes. Instead of working at home with one machine and doing each
load one after the other, Rich does all three simultaneously — in parallel, if
you will. Simultaneously washing (and, later, drying) three loads of clothes at
once greatly reduces the time it takes to get the job done.
That good ol’ human brain works much like this parallel-processing model,
despite the disadvantage of slow-speed neural circuitry. For pattern recogni-
tion — a parallel-processing specialty — the human mind does a great job.
For extensive sequential thinking, however — having that billionth thought in
a row — the poor old gray matter falls short. Easy to see why: Life is short.
And Fast Is Good Because . . . ?
We ultimately want a computer with fantastically fast circuitry (the opposite
of our slow neurons) that can work in parallel (like our brain architecture).
Fast computers can be used to simulate our world — at both the molecular
level and the atmospheric level. In such a world, drugs could be developed
119
Chapter 6: Building a Better Digital Brain

and tested on simulated bodies, allowing for catered medicine. Imagine a situ-
ation where we program a simulated *you* and a variety of drugs are tested
on said simulated *you* until the best drug is found. This drug is then pro-
duced and given to . . . you, the real you. Optimata, an Israeli company,
already does this by creating a software “clone” of the patient, which helps
doctors customize cancer treatment. NEC built the Earth Simulator to simu-
late the interaction of atmosphere, oceans, and land to predict natural disas-
ters and the effects of environmental destruction. This model aids in
understanding how industrialization will affect local rivers and air quality.
On another tack, secure communications and encryption are incredibly impor-
tant, not only for governments but for large businesses as well — and parallel
processors and faster computers developed by other countries/businesses
are going to make today’s encryption easy to crack. Nanotechnology is set to
create better software “locks” to meet this challenge, ensuring security. The
emergence of identity theft and the threat of terrorism has contributed to the
rise of biometrics — identification based on a person’s physical characteris-
tics. Of course, for biometrics, you need blazing computing speed to handle
the mass of details that describe a unique face or provide immediate voice
recognition — and new processors built with nanotech can deliver that
power. To make it real (not just something seen in a spy movie), you have to
think small — very small.
In the larger world, economic forces are sure to dictate whether dreams of
faster processing power become reality. For example, is it cost-effective to
build processors with such speed? And how much value does society place
on this increased processing capacity? And if we do create artificial intelli-
gence (AI), will we grow bored because we’ve left it to machines to solve all
our problems? Will we be able to control the machines or will they control
us? (The Matrix, anyone?) Hey, if there’s artificial intelligence, will we also
have to deal with artificial stupidity (AS), or can we make do with the real
enchilada? These are deep questions to ask and something to think about as
we build that better mousetrap.
End of the Transistor Road
Computers do their computing in binary, using 1s and 0s to describe . . . any-
thing you can imagine. Now, a transistor is the switch that says whether a bit
is either on or off — that is, a 1 or a 0. Think of a water dam: In the Off posi-
tion, no water is flowing through; in the On position, water is flowing freely.
Shrink this analogy down to a transistor: In the Off position, no electrons are
flowing through; in the On position, electrons flow freely. (Figure 6-1 shows
the source where the electrons come in, the drain where the electrons flow
out, and the gate that switches the transistor on and off.)
120
Part III: “Smarter” Computers! Faster Internet! Cheaper Energy! 

A transistor is the building block to the modern processor, and boy, does it
take a lot of them to add up to something useful — 125 million transistors in
Intel’s Pentium 4 Prescott 3.4GHz processor, to be precise. The smaller the
transistor, the smaller your electron gate — which means faster switching
between on and off, resulting in a faster overall processor. In Prescott’s case,
we’re looking at a transistor no more than 90 nanometers (nm) across —
that’s pretty darn small! And pretty darn fast.
The closer you get to nano scale, the more you see evidence of a general 
rule: As the minimum feature size decreases, the speed and performance of
micro-electronic devices rises rapidly. Computer geeks know the rule as
Moore’s Law.
Moore’s Law — as stated by Gordon E. Moore, co-founder of Intel — claims
that the rate of advancement in processor technology doubles every 18
months. This dramatic notion can mean many things, but has generally come
down to mean that the number of transistors squeezed onto a processor dou-
bles every 18 months. That’s been going on for about 40 years.
At the end of 2004, chips were being fabricated with dimensions in the 130nm
and 90nm ranges, with the goal of 65nm at the end of 2005. There will be
some problems going down to the 45nm and 30nm realm, which nanotechnol-
ogy will help solve in many ways — from new mixtures of metals that make
up traditional transistors to entirely new concepts, including single-electron
transistors (which work like a dam that lets one drop of water through at a
time — tough stuff to make real). Figure 6-2 shows a side view of Intel’s
Prescott transistor — an example of the former approach. Here, various
metals (silicide, silicon, silicon oxide) make up a transistor whose gate is
only 50nm across. A performance-enhancing feature of this transistor is the
strained silicon — individual silicon atoms stretched apart so electrons flow
through faster with little resistance — improving processor speed. Clever,
eh? Chalk up one more benefit of nanotechnology — using a combination of
chemistry and material science at the nano scale to produce a nano-size tran-
sistor. Now where the heck did they get the teeny-weeny pliers for the job?

From FETs to SETs
In the world of computer processors, transistors are our ever-present on/off
switches — switches regulated by tiny gates that either hold up or let pass
any traveling electrons. (Refer to Figure 6-1 for a peek at what a tiny gate
might look like.) To be more precise, this type of transistor is called a field-
effect transistor (FET) and is used in much of today’s electronics, including
today’s PC. In the push to make transistors for computer processors “better,
faster, stronger,” folks have come up with some unique remakes of the cur-
rent transistor but have also pushed a new concept that has only recently
been realized with nanotechnology: the single-electron transistor (SET). In
this section, I fill you in on both approaches.
The current silicon-designed FETs are going to be hitting their physical 
limits — not just the limit of how small we can make them but also problems
with heat dissipation, wire connections, and the materials we use to create
them — within the next ten years. Therefore, scientists are exploring new
ways to design and create FETs at the nano level without restricting them-
selves to silicon alone.

One area of interest involves creating a transistor using our beloved carbon
nanotube. Phaedon Avouris and his team at IBM have made significant
progress along the carbon-nanotube road over the last few years, culminating
in the world’s smallest solid-state light emitter. “Great,” you say, “now that we
have a nano-light, we can actually see what’s going on and get something
done.” Well, sort of. First, check out what Phaedon and his buddies at IBM
have accomplished so far:
 Constructive destruction: Single-wall nanotubes (SWNTs for short) are
the greatest thing since sliced bread, but even we’d admit that they do
enter this world as an awful sticky mess — which makes it cumbersome
to separate the metallic SWNTs from the semiconducting ones. (You’d
want the semiconducting ones for any transistor. For more on how
123
Chapter 6: Building a Better Digital Brain
Sizing up the nano-world
Metrology, the study of measurements, is set to
be a significant enabler of any advances in
computer technology (well, nanotechnology,
period) because metrology concerns itself with
a crucial question: How do you know you’re
achieving your nanotechnological goals if you
can’t measure your progress?
To illustrate this problem, take a look at a sili-
con wafer. Silicon is grown into a crystalline
structure — basically an incredibly flat piece of
glass. How can you determine — both quickly
and accurately — that your wafer is perfectly
flat at the atomic level? Any imperfections at
that level will propagate through your entire fab-
rication process, destroying your processors
and cutting into your costs. (Talk about pres-
sure!) Small wonder that the International
Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors points
out the need for an “inline, nondestructive
microscopy process [at nanometer] resolution,”
meaning that any measurement you take must
not destroy what you’re trying to measure (and
that’s a risk when you have to bombard things
in order to see them). What a conundrum.
Metrology-specific companies are going be the
first to emerge and have viable products. Think
of these companies as playing the role for nano-
technological industries that America Online
(and other Internet service providers) played for
the Internet back in 1994. Without ISPs, no one
would have been connected to the Internet 
and online businesses would have faltered.
Similarly, without the appropriate metrological
tools, nanotechnology as an industry is going to
remain stuck in neutral, as businesses see no
way to produce nanotech products they can
neither see, measure, nor manipulate at this
level.
Three companies making headway in this
regard are Veeco, Nanometrics, and Zyvex.
Veeco [VECO] is known for its microscopes —
seeing at the nano-scale level. Nanometrics
[NANO] (now that’s a nice ticker symbol) 
is metrology-specific to the semiconductor
industry — measuring at the nano scale.
Nanometrics and August Technology [AUGT]
announced their merger agreement in late
January 2005. Zyvex’s (private) initial goal — to
make molecular assemblers — has since
evolved into a quest for nanomanipulators. Well,
why not? To make anything at the nano scale,
you have to manipulate it. All in all, these 
companies will be some of the first to develop
products that you may never see but will 
aid companies to develop products that you 
will buy.

awfully sticky SWNTs are just out of the oven, check out Chapter 4.) So,
what IBM did was just get all the nanotubes together, lay them on a 
silicon-oxide wafer, attach electrodes over the nanotubes at each end,
and then “turn off” the semiconducting nanotubes — that is, they
blocked any current from traveling through them. Finally, they applied
an “electric shockwave” to the wafer — destroying some of the nano-
tubes (the metallic ones) but leaving intact the semiconducting ones —
the ones that had been “turned off,” and so were impervious to the
shockwave. This process can furnish a good supply of semiconducting
SWNTs for our transistor, and — a nice bonus — you can apply it to mul-
tiwall nanotubes. In effect, that means researchers can remove individ-
ual shells from the tubes one by one — and so fabricate nanotubes with
any desired electrical properties.
 Voltage inverter: A voltage inverter, also known as a NOT gate, is one of
the three fundamental logic circuits — the other two being AND and OR.
A 0 that goes into this inverter comes out as a 1 — and a 1 that goes in
comes out as a 0. A typical voltage inverter comprises two types of tran-
sistors: n-type (which channels electrons carrying electrical charge) and
p-type (which uses electron-deficient regions — also known as “holes” 
to carry the current). Avouris’s team devised a process that not only
changes inherently p-type nanotubes into their n-type brethren, but also
selectively converts part of a single nanotube from p-type to n-type.
Such fine control at the nano level means we can end up with a sort of
hybrid nanotube — one half is p-type and the other half n-type, creating
a NOT gate — the world’s first single-molecule logic circuit.
 Carbon nanotube field-effect transistor (CNFETs): These babies already
outperform leading silicon transistor prototypes by achieving higher
transconductance — the measure of how much current they can carry.
(We’re talking more than twice the transconductance per unit width.)
Result: faster, more powerful, nano-size integrated circuits.
 Solid-state light emitter: After they got to the level where they could
control the makeup of the nanotube, IBM scientists engineered this FET
so they could inject negative electrons from the source and positive
holes from the drain, as shown in Figure 6-3. (Refer back to Figure 6-1 to
see an illustration of sources and drains. We’re not talking the kitchen
sink here.) The nanotube is attached by electrodes at both ends, sitting
upon silicon oxide. Where the negatives and positives meet, they neu-
tralize each other and generate light — light bright enough to see with
the naked eye (if in the visible spectrum). Since this FET also has a gate,
the gate operates the switch on and off. Now, the diameter of the nano-
tube dictates the wavelength of the light it emits. The researchers, using
a nanotube 1.4nm in diameter, generated a wavelength of 1500nm — in
the infrared region of the spectrum, the wavelength widely used in opti-
cal communications (say, your Internet fiber optics). So, not only are
nanotubes useful in electronics, but they rock in optoelectronics as well.
124
Part III: “Smarter” Computers! Faster Internet! Cheaper Energy! 

Although we humans would love to use nanotubes in everything, the folks at
IBM would be the first to say that those small, sticky things are a bear to
work with, which limits their usefulness as a replacement for silicon in new
transistors. Researchers from the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel
have addressed this issue by trying another strategy — harnessing the self-
assembly abilities of (believe it or not) DNA to manipulate carbon nanotubes
in FET construction. They attached DNA strands to the carbon nanotubes,
hooked up their complementary strands to the electrodes, and placed a solu-
tion of the DNA-coated nanotubes on a silicon wafer. Lo and behold, the com-
plementary DNA strands combined — and that placed the nanotubes across
the pairs of electrodes.
Imagine if we, by introducing biological molecules which interacted with the
DNA, could modify, in real-time, the electrical behavior of these devices. That
could be very useful but would take many years to refine. These nanotube
FETs show tremendous promise — and they actually show promise, as
opposed to being a figment of someone’s imagination.
In the meantime, while we’re looking for ways to manipulate and mass-produce
carbon-nanotube FETs, other researchers are looking for ways to avoid the
Schottky barriers — areas of resistance to electrical conduction that occur where
metal meets semiconductor. In our case, they occur at the electrode/nanotube

interface, which hinders the efficiency of our FET. Researchers are determin-
ing under which circumstances the nanotube works best — and trying 
out metals (such as palladium) with an eye toward reducing the Schottky 
barriers.
Now, the whole idea of applying nano ideas to FETs was that “smaller” would
mean not only “faster” but would also generate less heat (use less energy).
Thinking back to our initial description of the transistor earlier in the 
chapter — where the source provides the “water” (okay, actually electrons)
through the gate to the drain — you can think of this process as opening a
floodgate. Lots of electrons pour from the source to the drain, using a lot of
electricity and giving off a lot of heat — which keeps us from packing in the
transistors as densely as we’d like: Too much heat destroys the processor.
What if we could control how many electrons were going from the source to
the drain — say, have them come down the line one at a time? Can do: Enter
the single-electron transistor (SET).
The SET can best be described as a one-way bridge with tollbooths at each
end. As electrons approach the first booth from the source, the single elec-
tron is allowed to pass across the bridge and exit through the second toll-
booth to the drain. Now, to make this language a little more technical (though
it sounds sort of like an adventure movie), the bridge is called an island, the
tollbooths are called Coulomb blockades, and when the electron goes through
the tollbooth, it’s called quantum tunneling. Figure 6-4 illustrates how the elec-
trons move through a SET in response to two factors: the source-drain bias —
a difference between the source’s energy and the drain’s energy measured in
electron-volts (eV) — and the gate’s voltage. Now, applying a gate to the
system may push the states down so more electrons can be added to the
island — but in general, here’s how the source-drain bias affects the move-
ment of current:
 A small bias (as in Figure 6-4a) results in a Coulomb blockade. The elec-
tron lacks the oomph to pass through the blockade from the source to
the drain.
 A large bias (as in Figure 6-4b) results in the transport of single elec-
trons: The electron bypasses the Coulomb blockade, is added to the
island, and passes on through to the drain.
Here’s the real trick — temperature plays a large part in determining how
well we can hope to control a single electron. Heat alone may provide the
necessary energy to hop an electron from the source to the drain. As a result
of this problem, most research of the SET has been restricted to low tempera-
ture environments (close to 0 Kelvin — roughly –273°C or –459°F — very
cold). Although the SET is ideal and an interesting concept, there is a lot of
work to do before it becomes feasible at room temperature.
126
Part III: “Smarter” Computers! Faster Internet! Cheaper Energy! 

Cees Dekker of Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands accom-
plished a room temperature SET to a certain extent. His team took a metallic
single-wall nanotube (SWNT) and used two barriers to define an island
between them. They created these barriers by using an AFM tip to “buckle”
(selectively cave in) the nanotube. (See Figure 6-5. AFM is short for Atomic
Force Microscope. For more on AFM tips, see Chapter 3.) The buckled areas
act as nanometer-scale tunnel barriers that block electron transport, giving
the island a length between 20 and 50nm. Dekker demonstrated that varying
the gate voltage opens and closes the gap, which led them to conclude that
varying the bias and gate voltages can give you some control over how many
electrons could be let through — although not much control. In effect, the
“on” wasn’t much different from “off.” All said, this unique concept is a good
start at producing a room-temperature SET, and will undoubtedly be
researched further.
Another room-temperature SET is a bit more mechanical. Researchers at
Ludwig-Maximilian University in Munich, in conjunction with the University
of Wisconsin-Madison, created a nano-electromechanical systems (NEMS)
transistor. They created a silicon arm 200nm long and tens of nanometers
across, covered the tip with gold (that’s our island), and placed the tip
between the source and the drain. They then applied an AC voltage to the
source, matching the frequency of the current with the resonant frequency 
of the arm. In response, the arm started to swing between the source and
drain. Result: Electrons flowed from the source, through the island, and to
the drain — all at room temperature.

A more traditional route to making a SET involves a nanowire. Instead of
today’s top-down transistor fabrication process (see the “Fabricating new
chips” section, later in the chapter), the folks at Lund University, Sweden, built
their nanowires from the bottom-up, allowing the researchers to control how
the different metals were introduced. This allowed them to determine the
thickness of their Coulomb blockades as well as their islands. Unfortunately,
these were not successful at room temperature — they needed temps at 
4 Kelvin. Still, their work is controllable, impressive, and could be used if tem-
peratures were a bit more reasonable.
Fabricating new chips
Today’s computer chips (and the integrated circuits that turn up in all sorts
of everyday electronic devices) have to come from somewhere; fabrication is
the industrial-sounding word for the complex process that creates them. 
Your computer processor in your home computer has roughly 125 million
transistors — each working in unison with the others, flipping those 1s and
0s to help you play video games or file your taxes. Each of these transistors
are built in one sitting, layer by layer — basically, you have your substrate
(ground layer) and you build up layers of different metals, oxides, or polysili-
con, one upon the other, until eventually you get something that resembles
your processor.
This isn’t easy — we’re talking over 250 steps over a two-week period, in an
ultraclean environment, in order to produce just one silicon-based micro-
processor. This highlights two very obvious problems in traditional chip 
fabrication — it takes too darn long and the working environment is a bear
that just gets bigger and hungrier for resources. And, as the scale of the prod-
uct gets smaller and smaller, we run into additional problems — stray signals
on the chip, a need to dissipate built-up heat . . . this is getting costly, in
terms of both time and money. If, as recent trends show, the smallest possible
feature size decreases about 30 percent every two years — and (presumably)
needs more time and money to make — then by 2015, we may hit the wall:

Making smaller, faster processors just won’t justify the cost of the fabrication
facility. How much is your computer going to cost when the facility that
makes the chip costs $200 billion? Do any of us have that kind of money?
Before we get all Malthusian here — you know, that theory that warned that
population “trends” would wreck the world’s ecosystem, leading to massive
starvation and the death of humankind by, say, 1923 — let’s revisit today’s
chip fabrication processes with the added perspective of some proposed
nanotechnology techniques that may be cost-effective alternatives, allowing
us to continue to get smaller and faster.
Field trip to Intel!!!
Everyone off the bus — and be sure you have your partner so no one gets
lost. Remember: Before we can go into the fabrication facility and into the
cleanroom (the ultraclean environment for making the processors), we have
to put on our bunny suits. No rabbit ears, fluffy tails, or hopping around —
just airtight white “space” suits that protect the chips from getting gummed
up with everyday human particles such as skin flakes and hair. Intel takes
this very seriously, using a unique nonlinting, antistatic fabric that is worn
over street clothes. The entire process just to put on the suit requires 43
steps — now we’re late . . . late . . . for a very important date — in the 
cleanroom.
When we say clean, we really mean clean — 10,000 times cleaner than a hos-
pital operating room. Huge air-filtration systems change the air in the clean-
room ten times every minute. Which means this guy qualifies as a “Class
One” cleanroom — no more than one speck of dust per cubic foot. “Why so
clean?” Pigpen asks. A speck of dust can ruin thousands of transistors. Just
imagine a boulder falling on Times Square in New York, causing a huge traffic
jam all across the city. The same goes for a dust particle on a microchip — it
basically obstructs the chip’s pathways, rendering it unusable.
Intel — and everyone else — uses one very basic technique — photolithogra-
phy — as the basis for chip fabrication. If you’ve ever played with shadow
puppets, you’ll quickly grasp the concept. Got your flashlights ready? Here
goes:
1. Start out with a thin, silicon wafer.
Silicon is a semiconductor that can either conduct or insulate against
electricity — ideal for our transistor’s on/off states.
2. Oxidize the silicon wafer by exposing it to extreme heat and gas.
The concept is similar to what happens when steel is exposed to water
and forms rust. What we end up with here is a thin coating of silicon
dioxide — an insulating layer.
3. Coat the wafer with a photoresist — a substance that becomes soluble
when exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light.
129
Chapter 6: Building a Better Digital Brain

UV light has short wavelengths, just beyond the violet end of the visible
spectrum.
4. Place a mask — also referred to as a stencil — of the circuit above the
wafer; shine the UV light through the pattern and onto the photoresist
layer.
The mask protects parts of the wafer from the UV light.
5. Using a solvent, wash away the part of the photoresist that you
exposed to the UV light.
What you get is an exposed area of silicon dioxide in the shape of the
circuit.
6. Use chemicals (acids) to etch the pattern into the silicon, removing the
exposed silicon dioxide at the same time.
Now the pattern of the circuit is etched into the chip as lines of exposed
silicon.
7. Expose the entire photoresist to UV light, and then use a solvent to
remove any trace of the photoresist.
You end up with a specific pattern of silicon dioxide that looks a whole
lot like (surprise!) the desired circuit.
Figure 6-6 is a handy illustration of the entire process.
This entire process is repeated over and over again, with each layer of mater-
ial patterned with its own unique mask and then etched away. During one of
the layers, specific chemical impurities are added to the material (called
doping) making the silicon either n-type or p-type (see the “From FETs to
SETs” section, earlier in the chapter, for an explanation of n-type and p-type).
Metal leads are also added to make the electrical connections.
Keep in mind that all this effort results in just one transistor — just one of the
millions we need for the processor, which is just one of the hundred or so
processors on a wafer. See, we told you this would be easy. Which explains
why some folks might be interested in investigating some Next-Generation
Lithography techniques. (Read on if you’re one of those people.)
Fabrication’s extreme makeover
Now, it makes sense that if we want to write smaller lines in our circuits, we
should use smaller wavelengths. Current photolithography techniques (as
described in the previous section) use ultraviolet wavelengths on the order
of 248nm, creating line widths of 200nm. Okay, it’s true that they’ve been able
to decrease the UV wavelengths to 193nm — and create features 100nm 
wide — but our goal is to get down below 50nm. That’s where we get 
extreme — extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation. Those wavelengths are 
seriously smaller — in the range of 10 to 14nm.
130
Part III: “Smarter” Computers! Faster Internet! Cheaper Energy! 

In principle, EUV lithography is quite similar to the optical projection lithog-
raphy described in the previous section — it just uses shorter wavelengths.
The main problem that we run into at these levels is that the properties of
materials in the EUV spectrum are very different than those in the visible UV
spectrum. EUV radiation is strongly absorbed in virtually all materials —
which means that we have to come up with entirely new processing tech-
niques. The following three areas have proven to be especially problematic:
 Focusing optics: Since refractive optics (such as your typical lens)
absorb EUV radiation, we have to use exclusively reflective elements
(curved mirrors, in other words) to focus our beam onto our sample.
These mirrors require an unprecedented degree of perfection when it
comes to surface figure and finish . . . which leads directly to one of our
main problems with processors at the nano level — metrology. How do
we know our mirrors are perfect? The reflective material doesn’t interact
with visible light the same way it does with EUV light; that makes mea-
suring in the visible spectrum tricky. Looks like we have to come up with
a whole new toolbox of measuring techniques for dealing with the EUV
spectrum.

Chapter 6: Building a Better Digital Brain

 Masks: The stencils used as part of the EUV lithography must also be
reflective (tricky process beyond the scope of this book). This also runs
into the same problem with detecting defects in the mask — how can we
tweak current measuring techniques so that we can use them to work
with EUV radiation?
 Photoresists: The photoresist layer is what gets exposed to the EUV
radiation and washed away, allowing the underlying metal to be either
etched or doped. (For more on etching and doping, see the previous sec-
tion.) The thing about EUV is that it gets absorbed by all materials —
which poses a problem, since we need to have a resist that is accept-
able for high volume manufacture that reacts appropriately to EUV.
Additionally, the photoresist must have excellent etch resistance — as
we get down to the nano scale, roughness at the edges of the resist lines
can create problems with exactness. We need something that can be
mass-produced and can create sharp features for our transistors. 
(No small task.)
To address these issues arising with the use of EUV radiation, Intel has
formed a consortium with AMD/Motorola, along with three national labs —
Lawrence Livermore, Sandia, and Lawrence Berkeley. Considering that the
EUV process is similar to lithography techniques currently in use (it’d be nice
to reuse and expand upon current facilities), this may be the future fabrica-
tion technique of choice. But just to keep you on your toes, we’d like to
devote the rest of this section to a few alternatives.
E-beaming
Electron-beam lithography (EBL) is a specialized technique for creating inte-
grated circuits at the nano scale. EBL “writes” using an electron beam, in
much the same way the scanning electron microscopes (SEM) from Chapter 3
“read.” The SEM would bounce a beam of electrons off of a conductive
sample, scanning back and forth, reading the reflected electrons as an
“image.” On the other hand, the electron beam (e-beam for short) scans 
back and forth writing electrons on a photoresist material, our desired circuit
pattern — similar to a printer writing to paper scanning back and forth by
depositing individual ink droplets. This photoresist material is now consid-
ered exposed and washed away. The previously described chemical etching
process is used and our single layer is produced.
Here’s what’s exciting — and not so exciting — about EBL:
 High resolution: Almost to the atomic level.
 Flexibility: Can work with a variety of materials in many different 
patterns.
132
Part III: “Smarter” Computers! Faster Internet! Cheaper Energy! 

 Slow: A magnitude or two slower than traditional optical lithography.
 Expensive and complicated: The tools used can cost many millions of
dollars and often require frequent service.
To give you an idea what we can do with EBL, take a look at Figure 6-7. (The
folks in Professor Douglas Natelson’s lab at Rice University graciously pro-
vided their talents to create this image.) Take a look at the scale on the 
width of the letter “D”: 0.044 _m, which is 44 hundredths of a micron — 
44 nanometers.

In addition to creating incredibly small images of book titles, EBL has three
niche markets:
 Maskmaking: Masks — those stencils used in traditional optical lithog-
raphy — are a relative snap to make with EBL: It offers the flexibility to
provide rapid turnaround time, and can control line width to stringent
standards — incredibly important for future EUV and even X-ray lithog-
raphy (explained in the next section).
 Prototypes: We’re told that Figure 6-7 was created in an afternoon (we
call that a cheap parlor trick, but okay, an impressive one). EBL aids in
small volume specialty products and prototyping integrated circuits.
Since EBL is flexible and provides a high resolution, it allows for quick,
experimental designs.
 Research: Since EBL writes at the nano level, researchers can use it 
to make nano-scale structures they can use to study quantum effects
and other physics phenomena. Areas of interest include ballistic elec-
tron effects (more about those in Chapter 4) and single-electron 
transistors — like the ones we discuss in the “From FETs to SETs” sec-
tion, earlier in this chapter.

Chapter 6: Building a Better Digital Brain

The grab bag of chip-fabrication contenders
In no particular order, here are a few more cutting-edge techniques for chip
fabrication, all vying to become The New Best Thing:
 X-ray lithography: Similar to the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) approach but
has an even smaller wavelength (5 picometers to 10 nanometers). Its
claim to fame is its penetrating power into the resist, great for creating
high aspect ratios (where the height of the penetration is greater than
the width). This process has been used to create molds, particularly for
photonic nano-structures (Chapter 7). A couple of drawbacks to this
approach include (a) the extreme cost of the X-ray source and (b) con-
trolling the exposures.
 Ion-beam lithography: Similar to electron-beam lithography but instead
of using electrons, we go with ions (go figure). Ions are atoms lacking one
or more orbiting electrons and are already used to implant dopants —
those impurities that make the silicon either n-type or p-type. Ion-beam
lithography may offer a higher resolution than EBL (because the ions
don’t scatter as much as beamed electrons), but it’s just as expensive
and slow because of the ion sources and scanning techniques used.
134
Part III: “Smarter” Computers! Faster Internet! Cheaper Energy! 
The bottom-line stuff
The business of fabrication is like . . . selling
pans to the nano-gold prospectors. And, to keep
this analogy rolling along just a tad longer, it just
so happens that two major players in the field,
Atomate and Invenios, are both based in
California.
Nanotech researchers have been buying sili-
con-based fabrication machines and modifying
them for nanotech experiments for a while —
and have been spending a lot of time and money
in the process. This is where Atomate comes 
in — they have already tweaked the fabrication
machine so the researcher can actually get his
or her work done efficiently (after all, time =
money). Since nanotechnology is rapidly evolv-
ing, these fabrication systems require continual
development and adaptation — Atomate is
happy to do both. As nanotechnology moves
from the lab to the factory, Atomate is poised to
shift from low-cost research systems to full-
scale factory fabricators. Along the way,
Atomate is patenting fabrication techniques and
processes, making its claim to the nanotech
goldmine that much more solid.
Invenios has developed a fast, cheap process
for creating 3-D shapes with a single pass of a
laser. Starting with a special kind of glass
whose atoms are unordered, a laser beam,
guided by a computer, strikes certain areas
inside the glass, displacing the atoms’ elec-
trons. When heated, the treated parts of the
glass form ordered, crystalline structures which
are then etched away by acid, resulting in the
desired structure — from microfluidic valves
(Chapter 10) to optical waveguides (Chapter 7).
Thousands of components could fit on a single
wafer, costing as little as 30 cents each if you
buy ’em in volume.

 Writing with AFMs: Atomic force microscopes (AFMs) resemble a
needle on a phonograph reading the atomic bumps on a sample.
(Chapter 3 has more on AFMs.) The thing is, reading isn’t the only thing
AFMs do — they also write. As we discuss in the “From FETs to SETs”
section, earlier in this chapter, you can use an AFM to bend a carbon
nanotube in two places, creating an island. Additionally, there is dip pen
nanolithography (DPN), which writes at the nano scale much the same
way that a traditional fountain pen writes ink on paper. Atoms and mol-
ecules are first stored at the top of the AFM tip and then deposited on
the surface of the substrate, creating the nano-scale lines and patterns.
 Nano-imprint lithography: The idea behind the printing press, Johannes
Gutenberg’s revolutionary invention of 1450, is pretty straightforward —
mash something hard against something softer so an imprint is left
behind. Stephen Chou of Princeton University has taken that lesson to
heart — and has begun stamping a hard mold into a softer material —
the trick here is that he’s doing it with features less than 10nm across.
He does this by melting the surface of a metal just long enough to press
a mold of the desired features into it. His start-up, NanoOpto, has
already shipped nano-imprinted optical-networking components — as
well as prefab nano-channels to speed up lab-on-a-chip genetic tests.
Although he’s sped up his imprinting time to less than a microsecond —
and can squeeze 36 times as many transistors onto a silicon wafer as is
possible with today’s lithography tools, this stamping process must
maintain perfect alignment through the 30 stamping steps. Taking a dif-
ferent tack, George Whitesides from Harvard uses a rubber stamping
technique: A pattern is inscribed onto a rubber surface, coated with
molecular ink, and stamped onto a surface (either metal or polymer).
 “Printing” circuits: Similar to an inkjet printer, but instead of ink on
paper, you print out a working ink-based plastic processor. Joseph
Jacobson of MIT Media Lab’s Nano Media Group has printed thermal
actuators (a sensor that moves when heated), linear drive motors (small
pistons), micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS — discussed in
Chapter 8 and used in pacemakers, airbag deployment, sensors, and
communication), and transistors. Essentially what he has come up with
is a nanoparticle-based ink — made of nano-size semiconductor parti-
cles, suspended in a liquid, and sprayed onto a plastic sheet using (for
the most part) an ordinary inkjet printer. The advantage of layering plas-
tic over silicon is that the final product is physically flexible (you can
bend and roll it like paper), but the disadvantage is that the processing
power is slower. Future applications include computerized clothing, dis-
posable cellphones, digital cameras the size of a credit card, and
wallpaper that doubles as a television screen — all quickly printed on
rolls of film.
135
Chapter 6: Building a Better Digital Brain

Does a Nano-Size Elephant Ever Forget?
Only the little things . . .
Man, was that a bad joke! (“What joke?” you ask.) There is a method to our
madness — it’s rooted in the vital importance of memory to intelligence:
What you remember has a huge influence on what you do. In an effort to
explore the depths of this human question, Philip K. Dick wrote the novelette
Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? — which later became the 1982 movie
Blade Runner. The androids in this story “replicated” humans to an amazing
degree, so much that they managed to get saddled with all the stuff that
bums humans out — fear of death, an overwhelming sense of life’s uncer-
tainty, and lost (or untrustworthy) memories.
We posed the elephant question (an elephant never forgets) to draw a paral-
lel: the importance digital technology is going to have when it comes to
saving our own memories from being lost. Yeah, computers are going to help,
but as our stock of “memories” — data — increases exponentially (we all
know something about the data explosion of the last decade, right?), our
need for physical memory to plug into our computers will increase just as
fast. Given that fact, it should come as no surprise that some folks are looking
beyond traditional memory technology — the ubiquitous random-access
memory (RAM) — and that some are in fact exploiting nano-scale science in
their efforts to improve upon RAM’s shortcomings.
Magnetic Random-Access Memory (RAM)
Random-access memory (RAM) is a memory capability that can access data
anywhere on the storage medium — hence random access (well, yeah — as
random as my elephant joke). Imagine your data arranged in a spreadsheet
table: You can access a bit in any memory cell directly if you know its
address (where the row and column intersect to form the cell). It’s like find-
ing a location on a map — C-12 represents row C, column 12. (Shades of play-
ing Battleship!) Input the address and you can go right to it, wherever it is.
Dynamic RAM (DRAM) is the most common RAM found in our computers,
cellphones, and PDAs. But just because it’s the most common technology in
no way means that it’s the best-designed option. (Was VHS really better than
Betamax technology?) A major drawback of DRAM is that it requires a con-
stant current to store a single bit of data. Every DRAM bit uses a capacitor —
if the capacitor is filled with a charge, the bit is a 1; if it’s empty of charge, the
bit is a 0. (Think of this capacitor as a leaky bucket that must constantly be
replenished or the data that the capacitor represents — more than likely 
a 1 — will be lost.) The capacitor charge must be refreshed thousands of
times per second, and all that work eats away at the power supply.
136
Part III: “Smarter” Computers! Faster Internet! Cheaper Energy! 

This constant need for energy is certainly not one of DRAM’s major selling
points. (No one likes to admit that their product sucks the life out of portable
electronics by straining a device’s batteries.) Instead of constantly having to
fill a leaky bucket — the DRAM model — how about making memory that
only used energy when it had to flip a single bit? Magnetic RAM (MRAM) does
just that — it uses a little bit of energy to help store massive amounts of data.
Magnetic storage devices (such as your computer’s hard drive) exploit a
magnet’s polarity — positive north or negative south — to represent a 1 or 
a 0. Now, as we get smaller — nano-scale small — we can capitalize on 
spintronics — the science of using the spins of individual electrons (one of 
the more useful idiosyncrasies of the quantum world) to help us out.
Sound intriguing? Then copy down the following bullet list and tape it to the
side of your own computer monitor:
 MRAM uses less energy: Unlike DRAM, the only electricity that MRAM
uses is to switch the polarity of each memory cell; it doesn’t have to be
periodically refreshed.
 MRAM is faster: Because MRAM uses less electricity, it cuts out the
delays associated with transferring electricity between the power
source and the chip — resulting in speeds 30 times faster.
 MRAM is nonvolatile: MRAM retains memory even when no electricity
is flowing into the system — which makes it similar to Flash memory,
the memory sticks you use for your digital camera. MRAM’s electronic
cost savings arise from the magnet’s hysteresis — the magnetic effect
doesn’t disappear when an applied magnetic field is withdrawn.
Just so you know we’re not talking about some pie-in-the-sky stuff, both IBM
and the Naval Research Laboratory have gone ahead and developed mag-
netic RAM technology. In the next sections, you get a chance to examine their
(differing) approaches a bit more closely.
Magnetic Tunnel Junction (MTJ)
IBM has been developing the magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) since 1974, but it
wasn’t until 1998 that they successfully demonstrated a working MRAM.
MTJs consist of two ultrathin magnetic metal layers separated by an insula-
tor. The insulating layer is incredibly thin — so thin that it allows electrons to
tunnel through — which is why it’s called a tunneling barrier.
Figure 6-8 shows two separate instances of an individual MTJ memory cell
representing one bit. The thin magnetic layers contain electrons whose spins
are aligned — either all “up” or all “down.” They work in one of two ways:
 Antiparallel: At the left of the figure, the spin of the top magnetic layer is
opposite from that of the bottom — it’s “antiparallel,” so it resists being
tunneled through. This tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) occurs when
the spin of the magnets are opposite; when an electric current tries to
tunnel through the layers, it can’t — the result is a “closed” junction.
137
Chapter 6: Building a Better Digital Brain

 Parallel: At the right of the figure, the polarities of the magnet are
arranged in the same direction — they’re “parallel.” This allows current
to flow freely across the junction. Writing data to a cell consists of apply-
ing a current to the specific bit, which then generates a magnetic field
that changes the spin orientation (from up to down or down to up) of
one magnetic layer.
Figure 6-9 illustrates a macro (larger-scale) view of how the MTJ fits into the
MRAM architecture. When the computer reads a particular bit, it determines
the Word line and the Bit line — and then reads the intersection (as shown at
left). When the machine writes (as shown at the right of the figure), it selects
a Word line and uses the Bit line to write the polarity.
IBM’s research team has taken their MTJs and run with them in several
promising directions:

Part III: “Smarter” Computers! Faster Internet! Cheaper Energy! 

 They’ve introduced lithography techniques: Creating MTJ memory
cells on a silicon substrate using photo- and electron-beam lithography
has allowed not only for a mass production techniques but also quality
control, creating uniformly identical MTJs across the entire working 
surface.
 They’ve reduced device resistance: Resistance of the MTJ tends to
increase as the junction dimensions decrease, but we want an MTJ of a
lower resistance if we ever want to realize the goal of making the fabrica-
tion of high-density chips practical. IBM has done this by controlling the
thickness and quality of the tunneling barrier, reducing the resistance
from 1 billion ohms (a measure of resistance) to 60 ohms per square
micron.
 They’ve achieved read and write times as fast as 10 nanoseconds:
We’re talking four times faster than DRAM. This was a direct benefit of
high TMR and low device resistance.
 They’ve increased thermal stability: Thermal stability (how well a chip
can keep its data intact at higher temperatures) has increased from a level
of 100°C to 250°C (but it will need to be higher for today’s applications).
Vertical Magnetoresistive Random-Access Memory (VMRAM)
Say what? It’s a whole different architecture. Vertical Magnetoresistive
Random-Access Memory (VMRAM) was the brainchild of the Naval Research
Laboratory and Carnegie Mellon University. The basic design and goals start
off similar to IBM’s MTJ:
 Each memory cell contains two magnetic layers that sandwich a non-
magnetic conductive layer.
 Electrodes are connected at the top and bottom of the magnetic stack.
(Refer to the stack shown in Figure 6-8.)
 The memory cells are formed into an array that consists of a Word line
and a Bit line, as in IBM’s MRAM architecture (see Figure 6-10).
This is where the similarities end. In the VMRAM design, each magnetic
memory element is round and flat like a washer, which orients the magnetic
moment so it flows in a circle — either clockwise or counterclockwise,
depending upon whether the represented bit is a 1 or a 0. (The magnetic
moment is a vector quantity with a direction perpendicular to the current
pulse.) The left side of Figure 6-11 shows the switching of the memory ele-
ment: As the current pulses in the Word lines, it generates a radial magnetic
field, rotating the magnetic moment into the radial direction. This can be
reversed by changing the direction of the current — reversing the radial
direction. The threshold of the current magnitudes for switching the mag-
netic moment direction is proportional to the thickness of the memory ele-
ment. (See the right side of Figure 6-11.) The thick layer on the bottom stores
the bit state (either a 1 or a 0) depending upon the orientation of the mag-
netic moment (clockwise or counterclockwise).
139
Chapter 6: Building a Better Digital Brain

Magnetism is confusing enough as it is, but we think you’re up to taking a
look at how this scheme reads and writes (as fast as 1 bit per nanosecond —
the VMRAM’s reading and writing abilities, not how quickly we can explain
said abilities!).
 How VMRAM Reads: Two electrical pulses are sent one after the other
through the Bit line. These pulses of current switch the magnetic
moment of the thin layer but not the thick layer. However, as the thin
layer switches, the current checks the orientation of the thick layer to
see which way it wants the current to go. The difference between the
first and second current pulses determines which way the current flows
in the thick layer — and that, in electromagnetic terms, is its memory
state: Clockwise is a 1 and counterclockwise is a 0.
 How VMRAM Writes: Here the approach is a lot simpler — a large jolt of
current is used to rotate the thick layer’s magnetic moment. It’s the thick
magnetic layer that actually stores the data. The thin magnetic layer is
used to read the data stored in the thick magnetic layer.

MRAM is poised to replace DRAM and become a $50 billion industry by 
2010 — but the question on every investor’s mind is, “Which MRAM type?”
IBM’s MTJ may be easier to fabricate (allowing for mass production), but the
MTJ model may have problems with its linearly oriented design. This linear
design may open up the possibility of a stray field (outside the memory cell)
and a demagnetization field (within the memory cell) generated from the
magnetic poles formed at the ends of the memory cell. This can greatly
reduce its packing density and memory capacity. VMRAM is robust but may
suffer from too low a resistance — no resistance means no bit-state signal, so
no 1 or 0 — and no computing gets done. The MTJ may be the first to become
available to the consumer — and is likeliest to be applicable to consumer
applications (such as laptops). VMRAM, on the other hand, is so robust that
it resists change even from hard radiation — great for military and space
applications. No wonder it’s being researched by the Navy.

Chapter 6: Building a Better Digital Brain
May the best MRAM win
There are plenty of companies including
Hewlett-Packard, Samsung, Sony, Intel, IBM,
Motorola, and numerous small companies (NVE
Corporation and Freescale Semiconductor, a
Motorola spinoff) working toward large capac-
ity MRAM, with each one working feverishly on
its own approach. (Remember, the MTJ and
VMRAM models we describe in this chapter are
just two approaches among many; we could
easily have covered half a dozen more if we had
unlimited time and page count.) Just to show
how wide-open the field is, in May 2004,
Technology Review magazine identified patent
number 6,545,906 — Motorola’s technique for
accurately writing data to MRAMs, making it
one step closer to being commercially viable —
as one of the industry’s “Five Killer Patents” —
and we didn’t even have room to cover it here.
Regardless of which design “wins,” we’re all
winners when we have fast, energy-efficient
memory — and when we don’t have to wait five
minutes for our computers to turn on.

Oh, yeah. We forgot . . .
Before we let you bet the family farm on MRAM, there are a few other
approaches that you might want to consider.
Millipede drive
No, we’re not talking 1980s video games or creepy-crawly bugs in tiny cars
here. There really is a cool, futuristic nanotech angle here — but first, a blast
from the past . . . punchcards!
Yep, punchcards — stiff cardboard cards with patterns of little holes in 
them — are on a comeback trail of sorts. They were the recording medium of
choice during the ancient golden age of computing (from the 1920s to the
1950s). Well, nanotechnology is looking to bring back that idea in a “big” way
(the capabilities will be big, anyway) — without the hanging chads. Behold:
IBM has developed a memory-recording technology called “Millipede” that’s
loosely based on the idea of punchcards. That may sound archaic, but imag-
ine data-storage density of a trillion bits per square inch — that’s 25 million
printed textbook pages on the surface size of a postage stamp. Judge by
results.
The key to the idea is to make the punches nanoscopically tiny. Millipede
hardware looks like a loom with a thousand tips marking 1s and 0s, as shown
in Figure 6-12. It’s these thousand tips that do the heavy lifting here, writing
data to a polymer plate below them.

Part III: “Smarter” Computers! Faster Internet! Cheaper Energy! 

IBM is excited about Millipede for the following five — count ’em, five — 
reasons:
 Millipede — small in size but large in capacity: Three billion bits of
data can fit into one hole in a standard punch card. A single writing tip
makes indentations only 10nm in diameter and has the potential to
address individual atoms — which translates into a huge capacity: 200
gigabits of data per square inch, compared to what you can put on a
magnetic disk drive (35 gigabits per square inch).
 Millipede is fast: Each tip supports data-transfer rates between 1 and 
2 megabits per second. The thousand tips that make up the Millipede
work in parallel, working smarter, not harder (just like doing laundry in
several machines at once).
 Millipede is low-power: Only 100 milliwatts of energy, which puts it in
the range of current flash-memory power consumption. Each tip is given
a working surface of only 100 square micrometers — not much real
estate, but those short distances ensure low power consumption.
 Millipede is nonvolatile and re-writable: It doesn’t lose memory when
the power is turned off — and each indentation can be written over.
 Millipede is cheap to build: IBM uses current fabrication technology
originally designed to build computer chips. No exotic new machinery
means a low manufacturing cost.
As for the details on how the whole contraption works, take a gander back at
Figure 6-12 and you can see that the Millipede has two distinct layers:
The top layer contains the tips; the bottom layer consists of a thin polymer,
and it moves left/right to get into position and up/down to read/write.
The tip (see Figure 6-13) is the same size and makeup as those found on the
Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) we describe in Chapter 3; it writes and reads
data by indenting into the polymer surface. The process goes a little like this:
 Write: A resistor at the end of the cantilever heats to 400°C, softening
the polymer so the tip can sink into it — which generates an indentation.
The dips and flat areas represent the 0s and 1s. You erase data in a simi-
lar fashion — heat up the polymer and (when the tip is removed) let the
polymer fill in the former indentation like melted wax.
 Read: The resistor is set to 300°C (below the melting point of the plas-
tic). This temperature does not soften the polymer, but when the tip
comes in contact with an indentation, the resistor is cooled. This cooling
causes a measurable change in resistance — which lets the computer
know that the tip just landed in a pit.
143
Chapter 6: Building a Better Digital Brain

There’s one major drawback with Millipede: The tips — just like their AFM
counterparts — dull over time. This will eventually make the indentation they
create larger and larger, which may result in the dips overlapping, which of
course corrupts the data. Just like there’s a possible solution to the AFM tips
problem, there’s a possible solution for the Millipede problem — using
carbon nanotubes as tips. Carbon nanotubes are strong and provide the
nearly perfect point for tips.
Although storage is a nice perk, the Millipede has another use — can you say,
“Metrology?” Metrology — the study of measures — has already made an
appearance in this chapter, where a lack of a nano-appropriate way of measur-
ing stuff reared its head. What’s needed is fast, large-scale atomic imaging —
and that’s still one of the main hurdles facing the computer industry. What
the Millipede provides is an array of a thousand AFM tips — the same tips
used in atomic imaging — which could be used in large-area microscopic
imaging, nano-scale lithography, or atomic and molecular manipulation. For
all its small size, the Millipede packs quite a punch.
Holographic data-storage system (HDSS)
The late twentieth century had some pretty fancy dreams. For example, the
1978 movie Superman flew fantastic special effects at audiences faster than a
speeding bullet — including a glowing green crystal (a gift from Superman’s
alien father) that created the Fortress of Solitude at the North Pole — complete
with a data-retrieval system that housed the entire history of Superman’s
home planet and all the engineering smarts needed to create that crystal
palace. (Automatically, at that.) Impressive as that bit of techno-fantasy was,

part of it may actually be possible: We’re willing to bet its technology would
have rested in holographic storage — and we have a real shot at that. We’ll
only get there, however, with cost-effective components and alignment
derived from nanotechnology.
As it exists today, a holographic data-storage system (HDSS) hits on some
memory-storage buzzwords: more information, smaller space, and faster data-
transfer times. A crystal the size of a sugar cube could contain 1 terabyte (TB)
of information — that’s 1000 gigabytes (GB) . . . 1 million megabytes (MB) . . .
1000 CDs . . . 200 DVDs! Not only is the capacity there, the transfer rates are
blazingly fast — 1GB of information per second — that’s the equivalent of
transferring an entire DVD movie in 30 seconds! (Come to think of it, this cen-
tury has its own fancy dreams — and some of them are already coming true.)
How does this technology do all these things? Well, it starts by adding a
dimension: Instead of using a flat disc such as a traditional CD — essentially a
two-dimensional medium — holographic storage ups the ante by going 3-D.
You don’t need to wear special glasses to view this stuff, though. Instead, 
the storage medium is itself three-dimensional (as detailed in the next 
paragraph) — and whole pages of information can be read in quick flashes of
light. That’s a departure from traditional ways of reading data (usually as a
series of 1s and 0s such as 10011010101 . . .). Instead, holographic storage is
read following a crossword-puzzle pattern (see Figure 6-14). The data is still
represented in binary form, but it appears as an entire page, rather than as a
linear stream of bits.
What kind of storage medium could handle the job? Well, think of a cube — a
stack of pages, each layered one on top of the other, and the stack of slices
resting on a photosensitive polymer cube. How do we read/write data to this
guy? Figure 6-15 gives the hint of an answer, showing the general layout of an
entire HDSS design. The thing to keep in mind is that there are two laser beams
hitting the cube (Figure 6-15) at right angles — the object beam displays the
entire page of data and the reference beam selects a layer of the cube, and

that’s where a page of data is either read from or written to. The meeting of
the two beams is what creates the hologram.
This concept is easier to digest if we break down the components of the
layout. (Okay, it’d be even easier if we could make it into a music video with a
“Follow the Bouncing Ball” motif, but we haven’t developed the technology
yet.) Here’s what we have in the Parts Is Parts Department:
 Laser: The originator of the light beam.
 Beam Splitter: Does what its name implies — splits the laser beam into
two beams (the object beam and the reference beam) oriented at right
angles to each other.
 Spatial-Light Modulator: This is actually a liquid crystal display (LCD),
similar to those used as computer monitors or added to the back of digi-
tal cameras. This LCD displays the crossword puzzle layout in Figure
6-14; the laser shines through it like light through film in a movie projec-
tor. This page of binary information makes its way to the cube.
 Scanner Assembly: A mechanical scanner that changes the angle of the
reference beam. Changing this angle allows the slices of information to
be layered on the cube.

 Cube: Either a light-sensitive crystal or photopolymer. In either case, it
reacts to the light from the laser to store the layers of information.
 Hologram Reader: A charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. This is actu-
ally the same technology as that used by digital cameras to capture
images. The reference beam reads the data as it selects and projects the
appropriate holographic layer upon the CCD reader.
After the laser projects a beam, the beam splits in two — and then heads
toward the crystal from two different directions. Then the scanner assembly
calibrates the reference beam and determines which layer of the crystal will
hold this specific page of holographic data. The object beam makes its way
through the spatial-light modulator, projecting the data onto the crystal. The
data is read when the reference beam projects the crystal’s holographic layer
onto the hologram reader.
Okay, reality check: We’re nowhere near the glowing-green-crystal level of
technology yet. Two substantial hurdles are currently standing in the way of
a truly viable HDSS:
 Getting the alignment just right: Aligning the laser, spatial-light mod-
ulator, and detector in a robust, cost-effective manner poses a huge
problem — without proper alignment, when the laser goes to read data,
other data nearby could also be read, leading to corrupt information.
 Coming up with the best crystal material for a storage medium: The
crystal-cube material has yet to be narrowed down. Various photosensi-
tive crystals and polymers have been researched but have yet to yield
that magic, cost-effective mix of performance, capacity, and price.
But we’re getting there. Nanotechnology will not only aid in cheaper compo-
nents but greater control over the composition of the crystal material and
alignment of those components — differences in nanometers can propagate
through the system and throw off the entire design.
Even so, HDSS is no careless product of wild imaginations. The concept of
holographic storage has been around since it was proposed in the early
1960s — but it wasn’t until recently that the cost of the components dropped
to reasonable levels. The laser is the same type used in common CD players,
the LCDs are the sort you’d find in many higher-end consumer electronics,
and the CCD sensor is what you’d find in digital cameras manufactured
during the last decade. The parts are there; almost the entire HDSS can be
made from off-the-shelf components.
But wait, there’s more. Not only does HDSS help out big time in the Reduced
Space and Faster Speed departments, but it also ratchets up our ability to
pursue data mining — the sifting through of large amounts of information in
our never-ending struggle to find even more relationships and patterns.
Here’s where holographic memory offers a unique advantage: associative
147
Chapter 6: Building a Better Digital Brain

retrieval, which is comparing data optically without having to retrieve it and
process it. Older methods of data retrieval are so last year by comparison —
so anything that advances data mining is set to make a big splash.
No, Lex Luthor, Incorporated, won’t be making that splash (Superman can
relax). Three real-world companies hope to put out holographic storage by
2006: InPhase Technologies (a Lucent spinoff), Aprilis (a Polaroid spinoff),
and Optware (a Japanese company). Their initial target market includes
those companies and government agencies that do image-search-and-
comparison work for the defense and intelligence communities.
At least one company is taking a run at one of the big HDSS hurdles: the photo-
sensitive polymer to be used for the crystal. In 2002, Aprilis discovered a 
silicon-based polymer that holds three to four times more data than other cur-
rent holographic media. What’s more, the new material doesn’t shrink as much
when struck by the laser (good thing, too — shrinkage introduces error). Good
news, to be sure — but even with this and other advances, the photosensitive
material is not yet rewritable. But you can bet they’re working on it.
DVDs
DVD manufacturers are not just sitting on their hands, waiting for the newer
technologies to come in and eat their lunch. They are busy themselves,
trying to come up with their own New Best Thing. Current DVD technology
uses red lasers (red wavelength is about 650nm), which limits their capacity
to about 4.7GB per layer — and that translates to about eight total hours of
video. Lowering the wavelength, however, can do wonders for increasing
capacity. A blue laser’s wavelength is on the order of 475nm — and shorter
wavelength equals greater capacity. How much greater? Well, when you look
at the two formats that take advantage of this technology (Blu-ray and HD-
DVD), you can see quite a jump: Blu-ray is already getting 27GB per layer, and
HD-DVD is up to 20GB per layer.
148
Part III: “Smarter” Computers! Faster Internet! Cheaper Energy! 
Can they really do that?
Just for the sake of argument, imagine taking
the blue laser a step further. Imagine
researchers at the Georgia Institute of
Technology creating nanoclusters of two to
eight silver atoms apiece by shining a blue laser
beam on an ultrathin film of silver oxide. Each of
these nanoclusters could then serve as a single
bit — the smaller the bit, the larger the storage
capacity, allowing for thousands of gigabytes of
data. Imagine that data could be read by expos-
ing the clusters to green light, causing them to
glow. Additionally, these clusters could be made
to glow in different colors, opening the possibil-
ity to simultaneously store multiple bits in the
same cluster. (Actually, you don’t have to over-
work your imagination here; the Rambling
Wreck from Georgia Tech has created all this
stuff already.)

Phase-change memory
Phase-change RAM (PRAM) stores data at the nano level by using a change in
the phase of the material to represent a binary digit. The material used here
(called chalcogenide) is the same stuff currently used in rewritable DVDs.
Figure 6-16 shows the two phases that are possible for the chalcogenide
material — it can be as straight as uncooked spaghetti or as intertwined as a
pile of noodles. The crystalline phase is ordered, the amorphous phase is 
disordered — and they’re as different as (hey!) a zero and a one.
So, how do we get from stuff that looks like spaghetti to something that can
write and erase data? We’re glad you asked:
 Getting “spaghetti” to write data: Tiny amounts of chalcogenide are
heated (with either a laser or electricity) to a relatively high tempera-
ture. It is then quickly cooled, freezing the material in the amorphous
state (spaghetti, intertwined lines).
 Getting “spaghetti” to erase data: The same area of the chalcogenide
material is heated to a medium temperature and slowly cooled. The
existing surrounding crystalline lattice provides the template from
which the material re-crystallizes from the outside inward, ensuring
alignment of all the lattice planes (straight, parallel lines).
Now, you may wonder how we read our bits when our spaghetti is in either a
crystalline or amorphous phase. Easy. The crystalline phase reflects light and
has a low resistance. Conversely, the amorphous phase absorbs light and has
a high resistance. The reading may be done with a laser — or by measuring
electrical resistance (albeit at temperatures lower than our write/erase tem-
peratures). So what we have here is two ways to utilize the chalcogenide
material: optics or resistance.

Chapter 6: Building a Better Digital Brain

There are a few companies working with phase-change memory. Hewlett-
Packard Laboratories are tackling the optical side. Now, as you’ve probably
picked up by now if you’ve been reading this chapter from front to back, stor-
age density is limited by laser wavelength (a few hundred nanometers). HP’s
approach is to use an electron beam instead of a laser — which has enabled
them to come up with bits 150 nm across, providing storage density of 29
gigabits per square inch — about three times the density of current DVDs.
Researchers believe they can increase this to 100 times the density of current
DVDs. Samsung Electronics is taking the lead with the resistance model for
PRAM, bypassing both Intel and SGS, producing 64MB chip samples. Samsung
hopes to enter full-scale production by 2006.
PRAM does great when it comes to things like high speed and nonvolatility. It
currently faces problems, however — three in particular: long-term stability,
how many read/write cycles it can handle, and its sensitivity to high tempera-
tures. HP is addressing the problem of read/write cycles by introducing new
materials; Samsung claims its chip can store data for more than two years, is
more durable than flash memory, and operates at high temperatures of 85°C.
Nanotube RAM
Yep, RAM in a nanotube. (Sounds like a 1950s tune.) Nantero, of Woburn,
Massachusetts, is using carbon nanotubes as miniature mechanical relays in
their memory cells. Carbon nanotubes could serve this function very well,
given their resistance to temperature, magnetism, and radiation. Imagine a
grouping of nanotubes acting as an actual bridge across a 13-nm-deep, 130-
nm-wide canyon. Applying an electric field to the nanotube would cause it to
flex downward into this canyon, where it would come in contact with the
floor — in this case a metal electrode. The van der Waals’ forces that make
the nanotubes inherently sticky — even with each other — would hold the
switch in place (nonvolatile memory! yay!) until a field of different polarity
caused the nanotube to straighten out. Thomas Rueckes (a former Harvard
graduate student for Charles Lieber) and his team at Nantero have ironed out
the fabrication process, but they still need to increase their large-scale repro-
ducibility; they hope to have nanotube RAM ready for commercial produc-
tion by 2006.
Molecular memory
Hewlett-Packard Laboratories (Philip Kuekes and Stanley Williams), along
with the University of California at Los Angeles (James Heath), decided to
throw out silicon and get really small: They started working with molecules.
This molecular memory device is arranged with a crossbar array of nanowires
sandwiching molecules that act as the on/off switches, as shown in Figure 6-17.
At each crossroad intersection in the array, you’ll find a molecule with a par-
ticular electrical resistance. A specific voltage is used to decrease this electri-
cal resistance so the molecule can represent a 1; another specific voltage
increases the resistance so the molecule can represent a 0. This concept is
just the tip of the iceberg for molecular electronics — and our next chapter
has an entire section devoted to it.

Quantum Leaping (Oh, Boy . . . )
Ever since physics wandered into the weird world of quantum mechanics
about a hundred years ago, science fiction has loved that weirdness and bor-
rowed its language. Case in point: Quantum Leap, a TV show aired from 1989
to 1993. The main character, Dr. Sam Beckett, leaps through time, landing (due
to some quantum weirdness or other) in other people’s bodies so as to “fix”
history. He is accompanied by Al — the hologram of a friend from the future
(who only appears to Sam) — and Ziggy, Al’s computer (dare we say “quantum
computer”?). Ziggy determines what’s wrong and what Sam has to fix. Sam
always has a dual identity: Inwardly he stays himself; outwardly he looks like
(for example) a baseball player, a test pilot, even Lee Harvey Oswald. He’s Sam
and not-Sam at the same time. (Hold that thought.) We’re going to use Sam, Al,
and Ziggy to explain some quantum mechanics — oh, boy.
Quantum. Practice saying it with a straight face (“quant-um”) at your next
cocktail party. (You’ll feel smarter. You’ll look smarter. You’ll change the sub-
ject a lot.) Quantum mechanics (or quantum physics or quantum theory)
describes the physical interaction between atoms more accurately than clas-
sical physics. Okay, the apple-bonking-Newton-on-the-head stuff works fine
for the everyday world — but for the nano-world, a few weird notions are the
order of the day:
 A quantum is a discrete unit in the same way an individual electron is
the basic unit of electricity or an individual photon is the basic unit of
light; if you have more than one present (and you usually do), the plural
form is quanta.
 Atoms vibrate and interact with other atoms, creating a whole slew of
unique electrical and magnetic properties.

Chapter 6: Building a Better Digital Brain

 Electrons show properties of both waves and particles — which is what
first put the kibosh on Newtonian physics at the turn of the twentieth
century.
Okay, but what’s all this weirdness good for? Well, for openers, it’s vital 
to two concepts that we’ll wrestle with later on: superposition and 
entanglement.
Superposition — two bits in one?
Common sense says it shouldn’t happen, but it does: Superposition is one
object simultaneously possessing two or more values for a specified quantity.
When Sam — our Quantum Leap guy — is in a person, he is both that person
and himself. Rather strange. Let’s get quantized and look at what happens
when electrons get their properties superposed. An electron can have spins
multiple ways but we’ll look at the case where it spins either up or down, a 1
or a 0 (see the connection with computers?). Now, we don’t know what spin
the electron has until we measure it — and the real kicker here is that when
we measure it, we change its spin. This is a Catch-22 — we want to use an
electron to represent a computer bit, but determining whether it’s a 1 or a 0
changes it from a 1 or a 0 to whatever it wasn’t — so we still don’t know what
it is. (Got an extra aspirin?) So before we try to measure the electron, we
assume it behaves a little like a 1 and a little like a 0 — that it has properties
of both a 1 and a 0 at the same time. This is called a superposition of states 1
and 0. Since we’re talking a lot about something that can be a little bit 1 and a
little bit 0 at the same time, utilizing individual electrons and photons, let’s
give it a name — how about qubit (short for quantum bit)? Figure 6-18 illus-
trates the critter.
We can certainly use superposition to our advantage — for example, spintron-
ics (“spin-based electronics”) exploits not only an electron’s charge but also
its spin. Current technology requires an electron to represent either a 1 or a
0, requiring eight bits to represent numbers between 0 and 255 but only one
number at a time. Ah, but spintronics let us use qubits — so, we can use the
“spin up” and the “spin down” states as superpositions of 1 or 0 — in a typi-
cally weird way: Because every qubit is a little bit 1 and a little bit 0, we can
use eight qubits to represent every number between 0 and 255 simultaneously.
Yes, we can get away with that — and it allows the compression of massive
amounts of data into a small area — one trillion bits per square inch. This
technology will dramatically improve memory elements, logic elements, and
spin transistors, possibly evolving into the much-longed-for “computer on a
chip” — and eventually quantum computers. (Many of us will still need that
extra aspirin, though.)
Such possibilities may raise the question of just how we can use the spin in
the superposition state. Light of specific frequencies, pulses, or polarities can
tweak the state. Since we haven’t “measured” the spin states, the qubits act
as if it has both values — executing two operations at once — giving us paral-
lel computing without taking up any more space. This is some cool stuff.
152
Part III: “Smarter” Computers! Faster Internet! Cheaper Energy! 

Entanglement — I am you as you are me
If you think superposition is crazy, entanglement is just bonkers: The quan-
tum states of two or more objects are always described with reference to
each other, even if they’re physically separated. (Einstein actually called this
phenomenon “spooky action at a distance.”) If two electrons are “entangled,”
what happens to one here also happens to the other one over there. Here’s
where Quantum Leap comes in handy again. . . .
Suppose Sam has just finished his mission, a bright blue light engulfs him,
and there he goes, “leaping” between times but still tied at both places. The
information that makes him Sam is what moves — nothing else. Sam’s atoms
do not leap; the information — the quantum states of each atom and electron
in his mind — moves because it’s entangled at either end.
Okay, okay, we know time travel is fictional. But what actually happens when
two electrons are entangled is about that weird. The information moves, but
you still need two different particles.
Why two? Well, another science-fiction device offers an illustration: Star
Trek’s teleportation technology. Suppose that famous starship arrives at the
planet Quantum Entanglement. A luckless, red-shirted ensign, unaware that

he’s one of the expendable characters, steps into the transporter — but
quantum entanglement works only for information, not atoms. Poof. He does
not materialize down on the planet. Nobody else volunteers.
This is tricky to understand — even scientists have trouble understanding
and explaining what’s going on. We’re going to move on to some of the 
applications of quantum mechanics: quantum cryptography and quantum
computing.
Outwitting Alia with quantum cryptography
Suppose Sam and Al, our friends from Quantum Leap, are on a mission and up
pops Alia, an evil leaper who sets wrong what was once right. In order to
communicate without letting Alia know what they are saying, Sam and Al use
quantum cryptography. To see how this might work, you should know that
time-tested cryptographic systems involve using one-time pads. Here’s how
the one-time pads work:
 Two people have the identical keypads, each consisting of a random
sequence of letters that translate into corresponding numbers (A = 1; 
B = 2; and so on). If the key sequence is random, so is our ciphertext,
which won’t allow someone to determine a pattern and decipher it.
 Encryption involves adding the message to the key and, if the resulting
number is greater than 26, then 26 is subtracted from the resulting
number. What we end up with is the ciphertext. In our example, X is the
letter from the key and H is the letter from our message:
X (23) + H (7) = 30; Since 30 is greater than 26, we subtract 26 resulting in
4 (E) which is our ciphered letter.
 To decrypt, subtract the ciphertext from the key — and, if the result is
negative, add 26, like this:
E (4) – X (23) = -19. Add 26 and we get 7 (H), our original message letter.
This seems incredibly simple — decoder-ring simple — especially since this
method is theoretically unbreakable. However, there are four criteria for suc-
cessfully using a one-time pad:
 Each party must have the same key.
 Each keypad must be as long or longer as the message.
 The key may not be reused.
 The key must be destroyed.
For Sam and Al, the most important point is the first one — a secure trans-
mission of this one-time pad. Here’s where we run into Heisenberg — or at
least his famous “uncertainty principle” (which states that the measure-
ment of one property in a quantum state will perturb another property): We
can’t measure two properties at the same time. This sounds a lot like our
154

superposition — photons can be polarized either horizontally or vertically,
but the act of measuring changes the whole setup. Although this sounds bad,
we can cleverly use this to our advantage. Figure 6-19 shows how we can set
the spins of our photons — and set the bit value each spin represents. Notice
we have two ways to represent our 1s and 0s — this turns out to be important.
Al has now figured what Sam must do to leap correctly and needs to relay
that message to him covertly. To send the message, Al uses a photon gun
(laser) and a polarizing filter; Sam and Alia, trying to intercept the message,
each have a detection filter. Take a look at Figure 6-20: It shows Al, Sam, and
Alia, along with their various pieces of equipment (we’ll assume that both
Sam and Alia have access to this advanced equipment in the time they’re in).
Let’s take their transmission process step by step:
 Al creates a random sequence of 1s and 0s on his computer Ziggy, and
translates them to the rectilinear and diagonal polarizations for each
photon that the laser kicks out. He makes note of what that random
sequence is.
 Sam randomly chooses which detection filter (either rectilinear or diago-
nal) is used to read each photon, and makes note of that as well. Then
quantum mechanics come into play: When a diagonally polarized
photon encounters a rectilinear detector, the photon will appear to have
either a vertical or a horizontal polarization. But measuring the polariza-
tion affects the photon.
 After all the photons have reached Sam, Al shows up as a hologram and
they talk to each other in the open (Alia may be spying but that doesn’t
matter). Sam tells Al which sequence of filters he used to read the
incoming photons — but he keeps secret what the actual bit values he
read were.

 Al then tells Sam which of the filters that he used were correct. From
that information, they know to disregard the filters that were not 
correct — and only use the correct filters. Now, both Al and Sam have a
series of bit values that represent their shared key. This series of bits is
shorter than the original number of photons used — but it has to be
greater than the size of the message meant to be encrypted.
 Alia, in an effort to read the photons’ polarization, also used a random
detection filter and tried to resend the same polarizations she read to
Sam. Let’s just say that at this point, things go “a little ka-ka.” Thanks to
Heisenberg, since Alia measured the polarizations and picked the wrong
filter, she could introduce errors — errors that Al and Sam could pick up
on and disregard as incorrect. Another nice thing is that Alia can’t read
one photon through both filters at once — that would be measuring two
properties at once, and quantum mechanics won’t let that happen.
Besides outwitting Alia, the main motivation behind quantum cryptography
is actually the quantum computer. When quantum computers come around,
our current method of software cryptography will be moot. Quantum comput-
ers specialize in a few areas — and one of those is the factoring of seriously
large numbers. Current software encryption (that is, 1024-bit encryption —
the gold lock that you see on your Web browser when you pay for something
online) is only secure if we have a large number that is difficult to factor.

Developing a secure cryptographic scheme is important even today — what
if someone stored an encrypted message today that could be broken by a
quantum computer tomorrow? Not all messages are timely — raw census
data, commands for a commercial satellite, or even the formula for Coca-Cola
could be decrypted at a later time.
There are some problems with quantum cryptography. Creating a device that
emits a single photon at a time is a big snag — but one that we’re sure nano-
technology will solve. For example, we can introduce a single atom into a
block of a different element — exciting that single atom will produce our
single photon.
Why is a single photon important? If two photons are transmitted at the same
time, Alia may use this to her advantage at eavesdropping — reading both
photons with both detectors will increase her chance of knowing what the
photon was and forwarding it correctly on to Sam without tipping him off
that she’s spying. To solve this sort of problem, scientists blend the security
algorithms of information theory with the quirks of quantum mechanics,
resulting in the emerging field of quantum information science.
Two additional problems crop up, however: slow transmission rates and short
distances. Since we’re sending one photon at a time, science has not yet caught
up with making this a quick process. Additionally, when we measure a photon
(which is either rectilinear or diagonal) with our detector, we may pick the
wrong orientation detector (either rectilinear or diagonal) and read the wrong
position of the photon. This prevents us from resending the correct orientation
of the original photon. This is similar to why we can “outwit” Alia — she 
can’t read our photons because the act of reading and resending may screw
up the original photon’s orientation. Ultimately, we can’t amplify our signal
over great distances as we typically do with electric signals. Current electri-
cal repeaters are scattered throughout the Internet, reading information and
retransmitting them to make sure that distances don’t degrade the signal.
We can send photon information two ways — through fiber optics or through
air. NEC has recently pushed the limits of fiber-optic photon transmission to
150 kilometers. Los Alamos National Laboratory created a 10-kilometer link
over air in 2002. So far, the fiber-optic approach has proven the most reliable.
We know what you’re thinking: “Where can I get one and for how much?” For
a mere $70,000 to $100,000, you too can own MagiQ’s quantum cryptographic
system. Of course, these won’t be something you can just plug-and-play on
your home computer — and at this point, we don’t recommend going out and
buying one unless you’re a government agency or federal bank. Companies
may also need this technology to do remote backups of vital business data —
a safeguard that prevents putting all their eggs in one basket. MagiQ (based
in New York City) and id Quantique (based in Geneva) both have commercial
products in use but will upgrade to more reliable service (especially in terms
of distance issues) as nanotechnology develops. Additional cryptographic
systems have been developed by Japan’s NEC (150-kilometer optical-fiber)
and England’s Qineti! (10-kilometer range through air).
157
Chapter 6: Building a Better Digital Brain

The year 2014 may be when this technology hits mainstream — but quantum
computers themselves won’t be out until after 2025. Still, we’ve studied the
tea leaves long enough to come up with the broad outlines of what such a
computer will look like. The next section offers up to you, dear reader, our
best guesstimate.
Building Ziggy, a quantum computer
Our quantum computer’s architecture stems from our use of qubits and takes
advantage of properties such as entanglement and superposition (business
as usual in the world of quantum mechanics). Each qubit will be entangled
with other qubits, and will represent a 1, a 0, or both simultaneously. This
sounds like a sleight-of-hand explanation mainly because the traditional way
to imagine a classical computer calls for transistors linked with wires, each
one allowed to represent a 1 or a 0, not both at the same time. Egad, what’s
this world coming to? Answer: entanglement and superposition. How they
apply to quantum computing is a tale in itself.
Multiple entangled qubits, each performing the same computation, work in
parallel — just like splitting up your laundry over multiple machines. This
greatly increases computing power for certain applications. Factorization —
breaking down large numbers into their factors — is one such application
and is our motivation for the quantum cryptography. For example, 15 can be
factored into its primes (3 and 5) by almost any third grader, but factoring
larger numbers can be incredibly difficult. (The number 15 may seem trivial
but it’s the smallest number that can be factored into two separate prime
numbers.)
“What about 6?” you might ask, and we applaud your thinking. The number 6
is the smallest number that can be factored by two prime numbers, 2 and 3.
All prime numbers, except for 2, are odd. So, using 6 in the following experi-
ment is kinda cheating and not fully testing the quantum computer or the
algorithm that the computer used.
Current Internet encryption is based upon a 1024-bit algorithm that uses
about 300 decimal digits — and would take roughly 3,000,000 years to break
into its prime factors, given today’s computational technology. Quantum
computers could knock that figure down to a few decades: maybe years;
maybe months; maybe a matter of a few seconds. Regardless, it’s turning the
impossible into the possible. Other applications that take advantage of quan-
tum parallelism are searching through large databases developing relation-
ships and highly detailed simulations — and we’re not talking about video
games. Imagine simulating atomic and molecular interactions, giving us great
detail and timely information about physics, chemistry, material science,
biology, and medicine. Besides breaking codes and simulating the earth, we
might see it in casinos — quantum computers are great at generating truly
random numbers — something a classical computer can never do.
158
Part III: “Smarter” Computers! Faster Internet! Cheaper Energy! 

Quantum computations are probabilistic — based on the probability of
whether we have a 1, a 0, or both. This is superposition of a qubit.
Remember, though, that we destroy the parallel function of the qubits when
we measure — instead of being both a 1 and a 0, it is defined as a 1 or a 0, but
not both. So, in order to execute an algorithm:
1. You tweak the qubits to represent either the starting 1 or 0, but they
are not defined (there is a high probability that the qubit represents
the 1 or 0 you want to start with).
2. You execute the program in parallel and rapid succession.
3. Finally, you measure the answer and a defined result is given.
4. This entire process is repeated until it is determined that the answer
that is given represents the highest probability that the answer is 
correct.
So, quantum computing is sleight-of-hand — we run the program and deter-
mine with high probability that the answer that we have is correct and what
we want.
In 2001 (the year, not the movie), IBM’s Almaden Research Center factored 15
into 3 and 5 using a 7-qubit quantum computer. This quantum computer uti-
lized Shor’s Algorithm, named after Peter Shor of AT&T’s Bell Laboratories
who devised the algorithm to factor large numbers into their subsequent
primes. In essence, it followed the above concept of determining the answer
with a high probability.
This not only shows that it can be done but, theoretically, is scalable using
more qubits — more complex numbers can be factored into their primes. 
It will take several dozen qubits to solve real-world problems. A 30-qubit
quantum computer would equal the processing power of a conventional com-
puter that could run at 10 teraflops (trillions of floating-point operations per
second) — the world’s fastest computer, IBM’s BlueGene/L runs at 70.72 ter-
aflops. This incredible speed comes about because individual atoms can
change energy states very quickly. Fast but not as fast as your brain — an
estimated 10 quadrillion (one followed by 15 zeros) instructions per second.
Even with IBM’s great work, we run into three problems that will slow down
our advance:
 The need for new algorithms: Like Shor’s algorithm for factorization,
new algorithms will have to be devised for specific applications.
 The need for new measuring techniques: We’ll need to discover new
ways to tweak and measure our qubits. IBM, in the work above, used
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to detect variations of the qubits.
NMR is an instrument similar to those used in hospitals for magnetic res-
onance imaging (MRI). As we progress toward a quantum computer, and
toward advances in nanotechnology in general, you’ll continue to see a
crossover of technology — in this case, medicine and computing.
159
Chapter 6: Building a Better Digital Brain

 The need to counteract decoherence: This is caused by the breakdown
of the quantum properties (superposition and entanglement) as a result
of the quantum system interacting with its environment. (We’re told this
is a very big problem.) This explains why we tend to not observe quan-
tum behavior in macroscopic objects. Decoherence can occur very
quickly while we run our quantum computer and can introduce errors
into our results; by slowing down the process with low temperatures
and error correction, we can minimize the effect.
That said, it’s important to keep in mind that although a quantum computer
will be able to perform any task that a classical computer can, it may not be
very useful for every operation out there — word processing, for example. It’s
safe to say you probably won’t have a quantum computer on your desktop
anytime soon — a practical working model for the masses may not even be
around for another 20 years. (Oh well. Call it something to look forward to.)

E
instein tells us nothing moves faster than light. In fact, it is so fast that as
you approach the speed of light, time itself starts to slow down. (Now,
that’s fast.) So when you want your e-mail or your fax to get to somebody as
soon as possible, what you really want to say is “get it there at the speed of
light.”
Of course, visible light is just one narrow segment of the electromagnetic
spectrum — and all those waves travel at light speed. Telecommunications
utilize some of these various forms of light (radio waves or microwaves, for
example) to throw information from one spot on the earth to another. With
billions of pieces of information flying over our heads every split second or
passing below us in an optical cable, the whole world seems to be full of our
thoughts. So full, in fact, that it takes a monstrous network of electric
devices, cables, and computers to keep it all sorted.
And sorting takes time. Even with the best electronics today, sorting digital
signals is not instantaneous, and every device, cable, or computer slows
down the flow, even as it’s doing its appointed task of straightening all the
signals out. Where then, is that perfect device, the one that does all the work
without taking any time at all to do said work? As you might have guessed,
nanotechnologists are leading the way here, exploring ways to create an all-
optical router that could route the information without having to convert it
from light to electricity — in the process increasing its speed by a factor of
100! They are also looking at other applications for nano-designed optics,
including ultrasharp image recorders and projectors — even a nano-size
laser. In the world of nanotechnology, the future won’t just be smaller; it’ll get
a whole lot faster!

Manipulating Light with Crystals
Simplicity is scarce and sought-after these days — but do you have to sacri-
fice it if you want speed? In the ancient world, all roads led to Rome, which
made maps pretty simple — you could get your goods, news, and gossip from
here to there in pretty good time, on roads that Roman technology made
straight, firm, and easy to build. As our technology still seeks to increase the
speed at which information travels, the scale gets global and we find the
simple Roman roads have been replaced by the (frighteningly complex) infor-
mation superhighway.
You may have heard of this “highway” and thought, “where the heck is this
thing?” or “Can I drive my car on it?” The answers are: “Right under your
nose,” and “No, please stop trying.” Although the information superhighway
has often been used as just another name for the Internet, it also describes
the vast network of (usually underground) optical and electrical cables now
used to carry information.
Improving those cables, and increasing the speed limit on the highway, is a
good way to get information traveling faster, and significant work has already
been done in that arena. Fiber optics, using flexible cables of glass to carry
information by means of light pulses, goes a long way towards moving news
faster — remember: light travels faster than electricity — and optical cables
can carry a lot more information than electrical ones — thousands of times
more. A single fiber, in principle, can transmit up to 25 trillion bits per 
second — that’s all the telephone conversations taking place in the United
States at a given instant.
That’s all fine and dandy, but we shouldn’t be resting on our laurels here.
Nanotechnology is set to take the next step and improve the highway yet
again. And there is definitely still room for improvement. As you might imag-
ine, keeping the highway from jamming when there’s so much information
traffic careening about is a hard job, and electrical routing is presently work-
ing at near capacity. (“Electrical what?” you say. Oh yeah. We forgot one little
detail: Electrical routers have to convert the light pulses from the fast fiber-
optic cables into electrical signals, and then reconvert and send them out
into optical cables again after they’ve been sorted. When the routers start
reaching the upper limits of their capabilities, you start getting electronic
bottlenecks at the routers.)
This overcomplicated, maxed-out scene could use some simplifying. Well,
how about a little crystal clarity? Crystals designed on the nano scale could
replace electrical routers — and cut through the conversion folderol — by
directing the light itself instead of first converting it into electrical signals. The
fiber-optic cables you use to carry information are potentially capable of
transferring data at 10 to 40 Gbps (gigabits per second), but most electrical
routing occurs at less than 1 percent of that rate. If you transfer to an all-
optical router, you could route most data packets in less than one trillionth of
162
Part III: “Smarter” Computers! Faster Internet! Cheaper Energy! 

a second, pushing routing speed till it can handle the full capacity of the
fiber-optic cable network. Not only will the highway be able to handle higher
speeds, it will be able to handle heavier traffic. (If only the automotive high-
ways were improving so well.)
Before we can look at the details of how such an all-optical router would 
work — or even the myriad other possibilities that nanotechnology can pro-
vide for the optical world — we need to look at the nano-scale pieces of light
that our crystals will be dealing with. These pieces are called photons —
which means that the science of manipulating such pieces of light is known
as photonics.
Getting hooked on photonics
Okay, so what’s a photon, and why do all the “f” words in science start with
“ph?” A photon is the smallest unit of light, just like a single electron is the
smallest unit of electricity. You could never see a single photon with your
naked eye because it doesn’t really have a shape or size, and you could never
feel its weight in your hand because photons don’t have any mass. They are
just like light; in fact, they are light — the building blocks of light, and as such
they normally travel in big groups so that you can see them all together as,
say, a sunbeam.
Miss Sunbeam versus Photon Man
The information superhighway can’t live on sunbeams (poetic as that would
be) because such photons are usually disorganized, and who wants a garbled
message? Orderly photons have to be made — and come from special sources
such as lasers — before they can be used as signal carriers. The trick is, pho-
tons can’t really carry anything (they’d need weight to do that) — so they
aren’t just the messenger, they’re also the message. By varying the number of
photons you send (and when you send them), you can form a code of high
and low pulses, much like the dot-and-dash Morse code used in Boy Scout
telegraphs the world over. Now, in the nano-crystal routers we’re set to build,
we’ll be able to send those pulses in the right places as light, without first
having to convert them to electricity and then back to light again.
When you work at the nano scale, you rarely encounter large mobs of pho-
tons (like the sunbeam); instead, you have to deal with a few photons at a
time. If your nano-crystal accidentally stops just one of the photons, you’ve
immediately lost most (if not all) of your information. Stopping light — as
anyone who ever made shadow puppets knows — is ridiculously easy.
Photons love to be absorbed by just about anything. And those things that
don’t absorb light usually reflect it. Thus the intrepid photon messenger
must face getting either sucked up or bounced.
163
Chapter 7: Routing Information at the Speed of Light

Controlling where photons are absorbed and where they are deflected is the
business of photonics — and the concern of all nano-scale optical devices.
Most of the time, we want those photons deflected as a means of moving
information along a path, bouncing photons to their final destination. So we
do something that bars and nightclubs started a long time ago: We check IDs.
Wavelengths: Creating nano-size IDs
To photons, the world is always vibrating because they are always vibrating.
This shaking, rattling, and rolling is a fundamental part of any photon’s life —
so much so that a photon (and light itself) can be considered as a wave.
Okay, how can a photon be a particle and a wave? Well, maybe that’s the only
way it can deal with constant change — by hedging its bets. After all, you —
along with all other things in the universe — are made up of stuff that’s both
a particle and a wave. Whether the stuff acts like a particle or a wave depends
on the situation.
Whoa — stop the ride. You came here to read about nanotechnology, not
have the universe start vibrating all around you. Well, not to worry: You can
safely forget about most of the universe vibrating because its vibrations are
incredibly fast and really small. On the other hand, photons — traveling as
they do at the speed of light — have quite detectable vibrations. In fact, the
length of the space it takes for them to go through one cycle of a vibration is
what determines the wavelength of a distinct bunch of photons. (So that’s
where that term comes from!)
A typical wavelength of visible light is about 600 nanometers — hey, that’s
not just microscopic but nanoscopic! Yep, most of the light you deal with
does its thing on a nano scale. We’re not saying that photons per se are nano-
size (remember, they don’t really have a size), but their vibrations are nano-
size. And it turns out that any nano-crystal router worth its salt — the kind of
routers set to kick the speed of information transfer up a notch or two — is
going to have to use the wavelengths of photons as a way to identify them.
You identify wavelengths all the time when you listen to any of the latest hip-
hop tracks on the radio — or even Pink Floyd on that ’70s station you’d never
admit to listening to. Short-wavelength sounds make for the high-pitched
vocals, and long-wavelength sounds make for a thumping bass line. Now, it
may seem weird, but a nanoscopic crystal has its own “ear.” It identifies dif-
ferent wavelengths of light by responding to how they travel. It turns out that
different wavelengths of light travel at different angles when they’re passing
through a medium, separating into their signature colors (a process called
diffraction) — as you can see for yourself if you hold up a prism and let the
light shine through and fan out. What you get is that wonderful rainbow pat-
tern that thrilled everybody back in high-school physics class. (You can also
use a diamond, if you have one lying around — a soap bubble also works in a
pinch.) The rainbow created this way also clearly identifies the various wave-
lengths of light: Each wavelength gives off a different amount of energy —
which the human eye perceives as a color.
164
Part III: “Smarter” Computers! Faster Internet! Cheaper Energy! 

Optical communication is a pretty exclusive nightclub; usually we only allow
1500-nanometer wavelength light (part of the infrared spectrum) into the
party because it’s the telecommunications standard wavelength. So, if our
crystal-based router is specifically designed to the 1500-nanometer wave-
length, it can be integrated into the Internet. It’s important to note that differ-
ent materials and crystal designs can be specifically tailored for a specific
wavelength and only this specific wavelength, excluding all others. If you
don’t have the 1500nm ID, you can’t come in.
Controlling light: Photonic band gaps
Photons and electrons don’t have a lot in common — photons are “light”
(massless) and fast and electrons are heavy and slow and never the twain
shall meet — but similar technology is needed to manipulate each of them.
That’s no fluke; when you replace a slow electrical device with a quicker opti-
cal one, you often use the old design to generate ideas for the new one. For
example, old-school semiconductor manufacturers “dope” silicon crystals
with just enough impurities to dramatically change the crystals’ electrical
properties. We can borrow that technique; if we add just enough of the right
impurities to our nanocrystals, we get semitransparent structures: Some light
won’t pass through, but some will — and come out in a specific range of
wavelengths. And as everybody knows who read the previous section of this
chapter, different photons with different wavelengths have different levels of
energy. By varying the geometry of the nanocrystal, you can change which
energies get stopped by the opaque part of the crystal — and which ones
pass through the transparent portion. You decide which photons to let out of
prism (so to speak).
Want a great excuse to play with imaginary marbles? (No, we haven’t lost
ours.) Imagine a large bowl with the marbles spinning around inside. The
fastest-moving marbles spin around near the top; the slowest marbles spin
near the bottom, and most of the marbles spin somewhere in-between. Now
put some putty in a circle around the middle of the bowl. Marbles that want
to spin around at that level either get stuck in the putty or bounce to higher
or lower parts of the bowl — and the marbles already in the high or low sec-
tions can’t cross the putty. That putty functions as a band gap: It separates
the marbles into groups that have different levels of energy, and keeps them
separate (as conveniently illustrated in Figure 7-1).
Here’s another way to think of this light-controlling stuff: We’re interested in
making materials that act as “light insulators” — materials that control how
much (or what kind of) light is allowed to pass through the nanocrystal.
These light insulators provide a photonic band gap that corresponds to a spe-
cific wavelength of light — photons that have that particular wavelength
have to travel within the photonic band gap, restricted from the surrounding
material.
165
Chapter 7: Routing Information at the Speed of Light

We can create band gaps in these “light insulators” (well, we might as well go
ahead and call them photonic crystals, a specialized nanocrystal made to insu-
late light) one of two ways: either by exploiting geometric abnormalities in
the crystal (missing or odd-shaped parts of the structure), or by using impu-
rities in the crystal (the other materials we mix in). Additionally, changing the
geometry of the impurities’ molecules allows us to set up a couple of distinct
energy levels inside the band gap — kind of like cutting a few tracks in the
putty for the marbles to travel in.
Some photonic crystals are grown the same way computer chips are made.
Those of you who manufacture your own chips in your garage (don’t we all?)
know that a silicon crystal is grown slowly, layer by layer, and impurities or
geometries are etched in. You can create a honeycomb pattern in the crystal
by etching opaque circles into each two-dimensional layer, spacing them at
regular intervals. As you build up the layers with the circles always in the
same places, the circles become rods.
Now, in some places, when we build our layers we don’t include the circles,
which in turn don’t produce rods — just empty spaces. The chemical proper-
ties of these rods — when they are there — shape the photonic band gap:
Light won’t travel through a rod, but will travel in any space where a rod is
removed. Remove enough rods, and the light travels along a nano-size path
very happily.
To visualize our structure, think of these rods as jail cell bars scattered at
regular intervals throughout a large room, as shown in Figure 7-2. You can
only travel through the room where bars are removed. Remember, we are
insulating light of a specific wavelength to be guided through our nanocrys-
tal. The fact that we’re using nano-sized defects allows us to control light
(which operates in wavelengths of nanometer scale).

Bumper-bowling with photons
Remember digging canals in your backyard so your newspaper ships could
get from Point A to Point B? (Remember what Dad did when he saw what you
had done to his lawn?) The same thing is happening with the band gaps you
etch into photonic crystals: The photons are traveling in the band gap where
a rod is removed and only traveling there — they cannot cross into the rest
of the crystal. This means the light will continue to travel along that 
path — with zero photons lost — no matter how that path twists and turns.
Figure 7-2 shows a top view of our photonic crystal. When the light
approaches the turn in the crystal, it bends to follow the path. This is differ-
ent from diffraction — the apparent bending and spreading of waves when
they meet an obstruction. The light isn’t traveling in a new material, and it’s
not changing speed; it’s just changing direction — at the speed of light and
with no loss.
Nanolasers and — I’m sorry, could you repeat that?
Along with routers, modern communication systems also need repeaters — in
effect, in-line amplifiers that take fading light signals and resend them with
more power. To do that with data shot along the line as well-ordered groups
of photons, those repeaters need to be miniature coherent-light sources:
nano-size lasers.
The photonic band gaps created inside photonic crystals not only provide an
excellent way to keep the photons moving along certain paths, they can also
provide areas that trap photons — optical cavities. As light enters such a
cavity, the photonic band gap (etched into the crystal) keeps the light from
leaving through the rest of the crystal. Such “trapped” light bounces back
and forth in the cavity — gaining in energy, tightening into a coherent beam.

Chapter 7: Routing Information at the Speed of Light

Certain materials — some semiconductors for example — can be stimulated
to emit photons. The LED (light-emitting diode) is a common example of 
this kind of technology, but is not a laser itself. To get the laser effect, you’d
most often want to choose a semiconductor-like material — called a gain
medium — and place it in an optical cavity. Photons enter the cavity, bounce
back and forth, and stimulate the medium to emit more photons. Those extra
photons are of the same wavelength as the original ones, so what you get is
an amplified version of the original light. (This “light amplification by stimu-
lated emission of radiation” is how a laser gets its name.)
To make a nanolaser, a photonic crystal is used to create a cavity that’s
almost as small as the wavelength of the photons themselves. This cramped
space forces the photons to travel in nearly parallel lines, until the intensity
of the light reaches the theoretical limit — in effect, all the photons are trav-
eling right on top of each other! The gain medium is essentially part of the
crystal itself — but before it can emit photons, a small electric current must
be introduced (that’s true for most semiconductor lasers anyway).
That little zap of extra energy is all the photons need to make a break for it
and blast out of the crystal as a laser beam. When supplied with a little elec-
tricity and a signal composed of photons, the laser amplifies that signal. Out
comes a flow of happy photons, ready to spread information around the
world.
Korean researchers have developed such a photonic crystal laser, using a
semiconducting material (indium gallium arsenide phosphide). Their laser
produces detectable amounts of light with as little as 250 millionths of an
ampere of electricity. Their design uses a tiny post to conduct electricity and
soak up excess heat without disturbing the main portion of the crystal at 
the top.
Self-assembling crystals
Part of the allure of nanotechnology is the ease with which many nano-
structures can be made by a judicious use of chemical mixing — a pinch of
this and a dash of that — rather than by using other more involved and
lengthier procedures. Growing crystals, as mentioned in the “Controlling light:
Photonic band gaps” section earlier in the chapter, is just such a more
involved and lengthier procedure, which makes it a prime candidate for a bit
of nano mixing-it-up.
One alternative involves a mixture of particles in a liquid referred to in chem-
istry as a solution. (Yep, the solution to our problem is a “solution.”) In this
mixture, submicron silica spheres float around in the liquid (called the sol-
vent), which is most often ethanol. Ethanol is a type of alcohol, the same as
found in liquor, which may explain why the little spheres tend to crash into a
plate that is placed in the solution. As the temperature rises and the ethanol
168
Part III: “Smarter” Computers! Faster Internet! Cheaper Energy! 

evaporates, the meniscus (a fancy word for “the surface of the liquid”) travels
down the plate, making it easier for any submicron silica spheres floating
nearby to stick to the plate. As time goes by, more and more spheres deposit
themselves on the plate, forming an orderly pattern. When all the ethanol is
evaporated, the first layer is finished and subsequent layers can be added by
repeating the process. Figure 7-3 illustrates this process — which is (as
enquiring minds would like to know) called colloidal self-assembly — colloids
being the solution of silica spheres (between 1 nm and 1 micron in size) sus-
pended in a solvent.
By varying the size of the spheres being placed in the solutions, you can
introduce useful chemical defects at specified layers.
After we have all the spheres lined up (see the left side of Figure 7-4), we coat
the spheres in a polystyrene plastic — we even get it into the dead spaces
between spheres. Once that hardens, we use a chemical etching process to
remove the silica spheres, which produces an inverted representation of the
original structure (as shown on the right in Figure 7-4) — the superlattice
we’re looking for.
Making these crystals is very quick and (relatively) easy. Unfortunately, they
also don’t perform nearly as well as their slow-grown silicon-crystal counter-
parts — we can’t control the defects as easily or precisely. Researchers in
both groups — the self-assembly types and the homegrown types — are
trying to improve their techniques so that someday all of us nanotechnology
aficionados can have the best of both worlds.

Optical switching: Nano-defects 
to the rescue!
Being able to form different paths for photons without being able to switch
between those paths is sort of like having guest towels without guests: Looks
nice, but who gets to use them? You have to be able to “flip the switch” (think
electric train sets here) in order for a nano-optical routing device to work. In
order to come up with a way of doing that, we need to take another look at
those photonic band gaps as well as the ways in which photons like to move
around, and maybe we can find a way to get switching to occur — otherwise
our nano-routers are out of luck!
Picture, if you will, a bowl full of marbles spinning around — yep, the exam-
ple we plunked down at the beginning of the “Controlling light: Photonic band
gaps” section earlier in the chapter. The putty that separates the top and
bottom halves of the imaginary bowl doesn’t necessarily have to form a full
circle. There can be small holes that allow marbles to roll through the putty
layer, from one half to the other. A really fast marble, rolling discontentedly
around the bottom half, would roll along the putty until it came upon a hole,
and then it’s outta there — up into the top half it goes. Now, if there were two
lines of putty, spaced a bit apart from each other, and holes in each of those
lines, a marble could conceivably roll around until it came to a hole, pass into
the space created by the two lines of putty, and then roll around until it came
upon another hole, ending up once again (voilà!) in the other half of the bowl.
All of this is brilliantly illustrated in Figure 7-5.

“Okay,” you say, “thanks for that intriguing discussion of bowls and marbles,
but we want to learn about nanotechnology now, please.” We don’t mind cut-
ting to the chase: The photonic crystal can be structured with certain defects
inside — on purpose — in order to channel photons within the crystal.
Fortunately, such flaws are pretty easy to create: We just remove some rods
(as we discussed earlier) or add in some specific impurities. With the defects
in place, we no longer have just a simple photonic band gap. Instead, we have
a band gap that allows a few photonic trespassers across the border. (This is
the same idea as the two rings of putty with some space in the middle, which
we describe in our bowl-and-marbles example.) Photons still can’t cross
directly from one side of the gap to the other, but they can go to the intermit-
tent level and then to the other side. “Oh,” you say, “now I see where you
were going with all that bowl-and-marble stuff.” Thanks, gentle reader, for
your patience.
Intermittent levels allow photons to cross the photonic band gap — they’re
the little wrinkles or folds that let photons “cross over.” Most of the time,
these intermittent levels are hard-wired into the crystal, but sometimes they
can be manipulated by outside energy sources, such as additional photons. If
you could regulate those photons, you could make an optical switch that you
could turn on and off by shining a light at it. (Now, I’ve heard of a switch turn-
ing on a light, but a light turning a switch off and on? Why not?)
Making the switch: Photons 
on a nano-highway
Researchers at Cornell University have already developed some of the nan-
otechnology needed to create an all-optical switch — they solve the problem
of using light to switch light. Using just picojoules of energy, they can switch
paths in a few hundred picoseconds of time. (Pico is the prefix meaning “one-
trillionth,” so this is both incredibly fast and also incredibly sparing in terms
Figure 7-5:

Chapter 7: Routing Information at the Speed of Light

of energy usage — one AA battery has about 1000 joules of energy.) Even more
impressive, Cornell’s nanocrystals use the most readily usable material — 
silicon. Even better results have been obtained elsewhere using more exotic
substances, but silicon is the best choice if you want to mass-produce
nanorouters.
Ready for a segue to another homespun metaphor? If you’ve ever driven
around in Europe (or in the northeastern United States), you may have come
across one of transportation’s most useful — and sometimes dangerous —
tools: the rotary. (The Brits call them “roundabouts.”) A rotary is little more
than a circle of roadway connected to several incoming roads. Drivers can
enter the rotary from a feeder road, travel around in the circle, and then exit
onto another road, all without having to stop.
The photonic equivalent (minus the fender-benders) is called a “ring-router”
and is pictured in Figure 7-6. Photons can travel along an attached path until
they come into the ring router and start zipping around at breakneck speed.
Unlike some drivers from New England I’d like to mention, the photons never
ram into each other or honk like maniacs.

The ring router has intermittent levels in its photonic band gap (in terms of
our silly bowl of marbles, several lines of putty) — and we can manipulate the
levels by introducing photons of the proper wavelength. When the right
beam of photons comes along, the router changes its task: Instead of allowing
light to zip around in it and go through it, it absorbs the new wavelength or
passes it off in another direction. Figure 7-7 shows how such a switch might
work. Notice that there are now two beams we have to keep track of — the
signal beam (the one that either gets blocked or passed through the router)
and a switch beam (the one that turns the ring router on and off).

Hey, when we get to that point, we have our nanorouters. That was quick!
We’re going down to the store and snap up one of those all-optical switches
right now. Wait a second, where are all the optical switches? Oh, that’s right . . .
nanocrystals as described in this chapter can only rout nano-size portions of
light. That’s fine for small sections of the information superhighway — but if
we want the equivalent of a 20-lane cloverleaf intersection, we’re going to
need something larger. . . .
Magic with Mirrors
For many children, as well as for many graduate research assistants who
seem to think they still are children, magicians can entertain and induce
wonder seemingly without end. Forks and spoons can disappear underneath
a deftly maneuvered napkin, sharp swords refuse to cut soft skin, and money
springs forth freely from behind our ears. After the finale of the show, how-
ever, it is all revealed to be smoke and mirrors — a series of illusions and
tricks.
It may not be magic, but nanotechnology offers to reproduce many of the
same feats — for real. Nano-designed catalysts and reactants (for example)
can help break down previously non-biodegradable materials and make them
disappear from the trash dump. Composites of polymers and nanofibers
could make super-strong fabrics to stop bullets and shrapnel. And we all
hope that these inventions produce an endless supply of cash.

Chapter 7: Routing Information at the Speed of Light

Yet, when dealing with light, nanotechnology still resorts to smoke and 
mirrors — well, mirrors anyway. Mirrors are a handy, easy way to direct light
around — and by doing so (in this case), to help control the information
superhighway. Reflecting large portions of a light beam is pretty easy: Just hit
the mirror at the correct angle and watch the light fly off at the same angle.
When you change the direction that the mirror faces, you change the direc-
tion that the information flows — it’s routing in bulk! While it doesn’t get the
details sorted out, it does move a lot more data around than the photonic
crystals could by themselves. Combining the two techniques could provide a
more well-rounded and versatile router.
But how do we steer those mirrors? Enlist some little nano-size men to the
cause? Interesting, but a tad impractical (Fantastic Voyage was fiction, after
all). We’ll probably have to settle for one of the many other ways to move
mirrors — to beam-steer, as the true aficionados refer to it. Figure 7-8 shows a
fairly tiny mechanical solution: 256 mirrors on a few square centimeters of 
silicon — about the size of a postage stamp.
Using electrical pulses to move the mirrors provides even finer control —
and allows faster beam-steering. Put enough of these fast-steering mirrors
together and not only do you get one heck of a router, but also whole new
ways of recording images. Such nano-imaging can even be active — the opti-
cal elements (such as the mirrors) move themselves to optimize what they
are seeing. Nanotechnology is providing so many new ways to use mirrors —
it’s starting to look like magic.
174
Part III: “Smarter” Computers! Faster Internet! Cheaper Energy! 
Harnessing the force . . . of nanotechnology
Not only can these mirrors record images, they
can also project. A famous example appeared
in May 1999: the first episode of the Star Wars
movie series. It was the first movie to use a
Texas Instruments technology called digital
light processing (DLP) to project the images
onto the screen. DLP is based on the optical
semiconductor called the digital micromirror
device (DMD). We did say “micromirror” —
although small, micro is a thousand times bigger
than nano. Each DMD chip contains an array 
of 2.1 million mirrors — each 16 microns square,
capable of switching 5,000 times per second
and displaying 16.1 million colors. It takes 
only one chip to produce images for a DLP tele-
vision — and in DLP cinema, they use three: one
for each color (and such a system can produce
35 trillion colors).
Although this falls into the bailiwick of the
micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) dis-
cussed in Chapter 8, DLP is one of those tech-
nologies that can benefit hugely from
nanotechnology (as in: tiny components, big
impact). A possible application is one we
describe in Chapter 6: holographic storage.
InPhase Technologies, for example, uses DLP in
their holographic storage system — and that’s
only the beginning. Nanotechnology has
already shown that it can bridge gaps between
industries — from routing to entertainment to
high-density storage.

Light-steering: Nanotechnology 
at the wheel
Aiming a mirror at the nano scale requires (surprise! surprise!) precise con-
trol of tiny electromechanical devices. Pushing or pulling on a mirror adjusts
the angle at which light bounces off; even small changes in angle can lead to
big differences in the final destination of a beam of light. To tightly regulate
the angle of a mirror on the nano scale, you have to spread out supertiny

electromechanical devices around its base. Each one pushes up and down on
its portion of the mirror like a . . . little nano-size man. (Hmm . . . maybe we
ruled out that option a bit too soon.)
Perhaps the most common form of electromechanical device is the piezoelec-
tric transducer or PZT — typically like those disks you see sketched out in
Figure 7-9. A PZT is built from a material — almost always a ceramic — that
expands and contracts according to the amount of electric current that trav-
els through it. (Unfortunately, PZTs often twist or pitch as they expand, limit-
ing their precision. Even so, when you control it with a very precise current
supply, the PZT can have submicron resolution.) Stacking multiple PZTs cre-
ates a greater dynamic range — labeled ∆L in Figure 7-9. Whether you use a
stack or single PZT, however, a simple linear setup is always going to be lim-
ited by two things: the quality of your supply of electric current and the
amount of twisting the PZT undergoes.
For the next level of precision, you have to go to flexures, which have more
aliases than your average super-spy. They are also called flexors, flexing actu-
ators, and deforming nano-positioners. Essentially, the flexure concept means
that flexible joints have been added to either one PZT — or, more often, a
team of PZTs — to counteract the twist that occurs as PZTs expand. (See
Figure 7-10 for a diagram.) The size of such a setup is really only limited by
the current supply of components; theoretically (ahem) it could be infinitely
small. Sources of electricity, however, are not perfect, and there will always
be noise and drift in the amount of current you can provide. Still, it’s already
possible to achieve precision of less than one nanometer for flexures.

Although it’s long been the premier technology of its kind, a complex PZT
system is also very expensive and difficult to produce — and a nano-scale
PZT positioning device can cost a million dollars without working up a sweat.
Many companies are advancing production designs and materials to bring
that cost down; they’re also designing newer and more precise versions for
ultrasharp control. Before you go sticking a mirror on the end of one of these
systems, however, you really should consider another option.
Researchers at Boston Micromachines Corporation (BMC), in association
with Boston University, have refined a technique to position mirrors on the
nano scale. Instead of using materials that contract or expand with electric-
ity, they are using electric attraction to push and pull on the mirror itself.
Although this is a more limited range of motion, it can be very precise.
For an everyday-scale demonstration of the strength of this type of attrac-
tion, just rub your head with a balloon on a dry day (if anybody looks at you
funny, just say it’s for science). Your hair will slowly cling to the balloon, and
try to stay there as you pull the balloon away. Place the balloon against the
wall and you will see it stick there until it slowly falls down (on a really dry
day, it may stay on the wall without falling). This attraction is familiar to us as
“static cling” and “static electricity,” but if you want to sound scientific, call it
electrostatic force.
The inventors at BMC use thin layers of silicon and oxide to stick a mirror to
a tiny platform. Then they dissolve the oxide; the result is a mirror with a
honeycomb of silicon attached to its base. As voltage is placed across that
base, electrostatic forces attract the mirror across the gaps of the honey-
comb (which are about 5 microns across). Controlling that voltage is the
work of some complicated software, but in the end, you have a mirror that
can be pulled with nanoscopic precision — not just in one place, but in thou-
sands of places.

Chapter 7: Routing Information at the Speed of Light

Figure 7-11 shows a finished BMC mirror — sometimes called a deformable
mirror for the way it can change its shape. (It’s the smallest reflective square
in the center of the circuit board.) Resolution in positioning is a few nanome-
ters, and improvements are underway. For now, it’s a tradeoff: Devices that
use electrostatic forces are as precise as those driven by PZTs but don’t pro-
vide as much displacement; the costs, however, are dramatically cheaper —
as little as one-eighth the cost of comparable PZT technology.
No matter which type of mirror-positioning device you’d like to use, the final
step in including it with the nano-router is fairly simple. (Remember: The
whole idea here is to use the mirror to do direct information in the form of
light, thus speeding up the Internet for us.) You can either attach a mirror to
the tip of the positioning device, or you can shine light at the tip of the device
so it reflects the appropriate wavelength (although opportunities to use the
latter technique are still limited). In the end, the nano-router’s use of mirrors
will probably be limited to bulk transmissions of data; photonic crystals are
faster for smaller chunks of information. But, hey, just remember that every
highway needs its 18-wheelers as well as its zippy sports cars.

Mirror, mirror on the wall/ Nano’s 
the sharpest image of all
Now that you can send information around the world at the speed of light,
maybe we should start gathering some of that info. Nanotechnology is start-
ing to take a close look at processing visual images to greatly improve the
information they can provide us. Active imaging, the process of adapting to
flaws in images while you look at them, has been around for while. Having
your pupil dilate when a light gets too bright is a form of active imaging. So is
focusing the lens of your eye on something far away. But let’s face it; dilating
pupils just doesn’t cut it in the Excitement Department. To get the pulse
racing, you really have to go nano.
In Figure 7-12, you can see three versions of the same image: Titan, Saturn’s
largest moon. Now, due to the (relatively) poor quality of their lenses and the
disruption of the earth’s atmosphere, normal telescopes show us little more
than a nice gray blob. This may have been good enough for Galileo, but not
for the folks who launched the Hubble Space Telescope. Without the distor-
tions of the atmosphere — and, admittedly, with better lenses — the Hubble
telescope shows some marked improvements. If you’re thinking space is the
place for seeing distant objects up close, think again. The Keck telescope —
an earthbound observer — receives the best image. Why? Chalk it up to
adaptive optics (AO) — a marriage between nanotechnology and computer
science.

Those little deformable mirrors we were going to create to route information
at the speed of light have some other uses, one of which is adaptive optics.
As light from the sun bounces off of Titan and heads toward Earth, it encoun-
ters all sorts of interference, be it dust, the earth’s atmosphere, or little green
men. Eventually the light reaches a telescope, with its own aberrations and
distortions, and you or I can see what’s happening on that side of the solar
system — if we can see past the distortions. Now, suppose you sent a copy of
the image to a computer, bounced another copy of the image off our little
deformable mirror, and recombined them in a way that cancelled the distor-
tion. Pretty slick. That’s the basis for an adaptive optical system.
Computer scientists — “nerds” to those who know and love them — have
come up with some pretty amazing algorithms to check how an image is
being distorted. Too many bright pixels in one area may be a virtual light
source; too many wavy lines may be some sort of astigmatic aberration —
and a big fly-shaped shadow may mean we need to stop leaving pizza out all
night. Whatever the case may be, good computer software is available to ana-
lyze an image and help correct it. (You may have seen this sort of program in
action on cop dramas where they need to “enhance” a video image to catch
some bad guy.)
Now, when you get the computer to control the nano-routing/deformable
mirror, it can bend and flex it in a thousand different spots. By bending in the
right shape, it can redirect the distorted light back to where it should go — it
actively compensates for the distortions in the image as they happen.
Furthermore, as the computer gets immediate feedback as to whether or not
the compensation is working, the overall improvement in image quality
increases. Figure 7-13 helps lay out this adaptive-optics process visually.
Forget cop dramas — this is more like Star Trek.
Adaptive optics becomes very helpful when trying to resolve nanometer-
sized objects. In many cases, the size of the object may be smaller than the
wavelength of light you are using to shine on it. This is like trying to pick up 
a penny with boxing gloves — no one’s getting rich that way. Any additional
resolution that the adaptive optics can provide is going to help.
Try looking at it through 
nanotechnology’s eyes
When you come right down to it, no matter what sort of imaging equipment
you have, you eventually have to use the good ol’ human eye to see what
you’ve got. For many of us science geeks, that means glasses . . . contact
lenses if you’re a chic nerd on the go. So improving human eyesight seems
only fair after we’ve spent all this time making telescopes and microscopes
have better vision.

Most researchers in ophthalmology will tell you that looking at the minute
details of the human retina (the fleshy bit at the back of the eye) is limited 
by the distortions caused by the eye’s lens. With the help of the deformable
mirror and adaptive optics, however, we can compensate for such distortions
and produce crystal clear pictures of the retina.
The University of Rochester’s Center for Visual Science has put to good 
use some of the deformable mirrors from BMC we talk about in the “Light-
steering: Nanotechnology at the wheel” section, earlier in this chapter. They
call their baby an Adaptive Optics Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope (AOSLO)
and use it to study the retina and help find cures for vision disorders. Similar
work has also been performed at the University of Houston, and other univer-
sities around the world.
Additionally, adaptive optics may revolutionize all sorts of sporting and mili-
tary optics. If the computer components were adapted, AO technology could
work on binoculars and similar equipment. The aforementioned universities
have already shown that an observer’s recognition of shapes and orienta-
tions improve when looking at AO-enhanced images. Everybody from Army
snipers to birdwatchers will be able to get a better idea of what they’re look-
ing at. Who knows, maybe my dad will finally be able to spot that elusive
blue-ridged speckled southern house wren . . . or Bigfoot.

onsider the world of electronics — you know, that world that provides
us with light at night, enhanced abilities to sense things around us, and
a way to run complex machines. Electronics also makes possible the com-
puter that you probably sit in front of almost every day. What if all these
things could be driven by nanotechnology? That might improve the efficiency
of — well, just about everything — and lower the cost of our daily lives quite
a bit.
This chapter is about providing the world of tomorrow with faster, more pow-
erful, and more efficient electrical devices, all driven by nanotechnology.
Lighting Up Tomorrow
Edison made a giant leap when he lit up the wire filament in that first incan-
descent light bulb. He was the inventor-hero of his day, but Edison was work-
ing in the Dark Ages compared with the things that nanotechnologists are
exploring today. The world may just become a brighter place when we start
seeing quantum dots before our eyes, and fire up light-generating nanotubes
too small to see.
Making quantum leaps with quantum dots
Quantum dots are nano-size crystals that emit light; the wavelength they emit
depends on the size of the crystal. Quantum dots are composed of various
materials, such as lead sulfide, zinc sulfide, cadmium selenide, and indium

phosphide. Quantum dots are useful because, depending on their size and
composition, they emit a particular wavelength, or color, of light after an 
outside source, such as an ultraviolet light, excites the electrons in them.
Quantum dots produce light in a way similar to atoms, as we discuss in the
next section. The ability to tailor the color of light emitted by a group of quan-
tum dots is very useful in medical diagnostics, as we discuss in Chapter 10.
The rules that describe electron orbitals (also called energy levels) — and
dictate that electrons are only allowed to be in certain energy levels within an
atom — are called quantum mechanics. Because electrons in these nano-size
crystals behave in a similar way, they are called quantum dots. (For more
about the nano-effects of quantum mechanics, see Chapter 6.)
Getting quantum dots energized
Quantum dots are useful because when you add energy to their electrons, the
electrons act like they’re in one big atom — and (as any physicist could tell
you) when you add energy to the electrons in any atom, what you get is light.
This occurs when an electron moves to a higher energy level and then falls
back again to its normal energy level. The same is true for quantum dots —
zap them and they glow. One way to add energy to quantum dots is to shine
an ultraviolet light on them.
It turns out that the smaller the quantum dot, the larger the gap between
energy levels — which means more energy is packed into the photon that’s
emitted when an electron falls from a higher energy level to its normal energy
level. A small quantum dot emits higher-energy photons — with a shorter
wavelength — than a large Q-dot can.
Think of this light in terms of color: A quantum dot of a particular size — a
relatively large size, to be exact — emits red light, which is the longest wave-
length of visible light; smaller quantum dots produce different colors. If you
keep going down smaller and smaller, you’ll eventually get to a tiny quantum
dot that emits blue light — the shortest wavelength of visible light. If you
come up with really large quantum dots (okay, we’re being a little silly here),
you might get them to emit infrared light; incredibly teensy quantum dots
might emit ultraviolet light, outside the visible spectrum.
So where do you get quantum dots? (No, you can’t find them at Wal-Mart —
at least not yet.) It turns out that it’s possible to grow a large number of quan-
tum dots in a chemical reaction — but the methods used range from simple
wet-chemical setups (in which you precipitate zinc sulfide crystals) to com-
plicated methods such as chemical-vapor deposition (which is also used to
grow carbon nanotubes, as we discussed in Chapter 4). You can control the
size of a particular batch of quantum dots — ensuring that they all emit the
same wavelength of light — by controlling the length of time you allow the
reaction to run. But what do you do with them once you’ve got ’em?

Putting quantum dots to work
Quantum dots — aside from being neat things in and of themselves — could
be put to some very interesting uses. The first application of quantum dots
will be for biological labels used in medical imaging. Researchers tag proteins
and nucleic acids with quantum dots; when they shine ultraviolet light on a
sample, the quantum dots glow at a specific wavelength and indicate the loca-
tions of attached proteins. Quantum dots have advantages over materials cur-
rently used for this application — for example, they glow longer. (For more
about the medical applications of quantum dots, flip over to Chapter 10.)
Researchers are also hoping that quantum dots could eventually provide
energy-efficient lighting for general use — in your home, office, or neighbor-
hood street lamp. In these applications, a light-emitting diode (LED) or other
source of UV light would shine on quantum dots, which would then light up.
By mixing different sizes (and the associated colors) of quantum dots
together, you could generate white light. Generating light from quantum dots
would work like generating fluorescent light — but without that bulky fluores-
cent tube. This method would also avoid the wasted heat that you get with
your typical incandescent light bulb.
Passing an electrical current through an LED also generates light. A company
called QD Vision is attempting to use techniques developed at MIT to design
a quantum-dot LED: a layer of quantum dots sandwiched between conductive
organic layers. Passing a current through the dots generates light (as shown
in Figure 8-1). Flat-panel TV displays using quantum-dot LEDs may provide
more vibrant colors than current flat-panel displays based on Liquid Crystal
Display (LCD) technology.
Getting light from nanotubes
Researchers at IBM, not to be left behind, have found that when you flow
electrons through semiconducting carbon nanotubes, the nanotubes emit
light at specific wavelengths — a nano-scale version of electroluminescence
(converting electrical energy into light). Figure 8-2 shows an example of an
IBM-style field-effect transistor (or FET, discussed in more detail in Chapter 6)
in which electrons flow through a nanotube to produce light.

Chapter 8: Nano-fying Electronics

Light is light, no matter where it comes from — and if a nanotube generates
light at a specific wavelength, it’s similar to the light generated at the same
wavelength when electrons move between these two states (each with its
own energy level) in an atom or molecule:
 Conductance: An electron in a conductance state is free to move around
from atom to atom in the nanotube. Electrons in a conductance state
have a higher energy level than those in a valence state.
 Valence: An electron in a valence state occupies an orbital in the outer
shell of an atom in a nanotube, at a lower energy level than those in a
conductance state.
Now, remember, electrons tend to be lazy; an electron with more energy
wants to get rid of it somehow. That’s why an electron kicks out a photon
when it settles down from a conductance state into a valence state. The dif-
ference in energy between the two states is emitted as light.
The energy level of an electron in a carbon nanotube is determined by the
diameter of the nanotube; as with quantum dots, a smaller diameter means a
higher energy level. Therefore, the wavelength of the light generated also
depends upon the diameter of the nanotube. Think of a guitar: Each string
has a different diameter, and emits only one certain note. In a similar way,
only a certain wavelength of light is emitted by each size of carbon nanotube.
In effect, you can “tune” a nanotube to emit light at the energy level you
choose. Researchers believe that optoelectronic devices — say, the ampli-
fiers used in fiber-optic circuits by the communications industry — could be
built making use of this effect. (At the moment, nobody’s figured out how to
use this effect to play “Stairway to Heaven.”)

Sensing Your Environment
In essence, the world is a great big place made up of very small particles. It
makes sense that going to the nano level will help us discern the finer-grained
details of the world around us. From sensing chemicals to sensing biological
molecules, nanotechnology is hard at work.
Detecting chemicals
Scientists, in their geeky wisdom, have developed sensors that use carbon
nanotubes as sensor elements to detect chemical vapors — even if said
vapors are scarcely present, with concentrations measured in parts-per-billion
(ppb, also known as really, really small amounts) — within mere seconds. 
(So just how do nanotubes actually do such remarkable things? You’ll have to
read the next sections to find that one out.)
It’s a chemical reaction
Remember those nasty chemical smells you had to endure in your high-
school chemistry class? Besides making you gag, chemical vapors can also
change the conductance of a carbon nanotube when a molecule bonds to the
surface. This bonding can either increase or decrease the amount of elec-
trons available for conductance in the nanotube. That’s how some nano-
based sensors work — they detect the change in conductance when a
semiconducting carbon nanotube comes into contact with certain chemicals.
For example, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) reduces the number of electrons avail-
able in a carbon nanotube. In this molecule, the nitrogen atom is one electron
short of becoming a noble gas — which, to be honest, is high on the list of
what it would just give its eyeteeth to do. (Keep in mind that a noble gas isn’t
part of some inbred, Eurotrash clique of titled aristocracy; rather, it’s a gas
with the most stable number of electrons of any element. See Chapter 3 for
more about noble gases.) When NO2 bonds to the surface of a carbon nan-
otube, it filches an electron for its own use — which decreases the conduc-
tance of the nanotube.
On the other hand, ammonia (NH3) combines with water vapor in the air to
form a molecule that can contribute an electron to the carbon nanotube,
increasing its conductance.
Chemical vapors that have been shown to change the conductance of a 
nanotube include nitrogen dioxide, ammonium, carbon monoxide, carbon
dioxide, methane, hydrogen, and oxygen. Molecules that include these
groups have also been shown to be detectable by nanotubes. For example,
nitrotoluene — a chemical used in many explosives and containing nitrogen
dioxide — has an effect on a carbon nanotube similar to that of nitrogen 
dioxide — so it may be detectable by the same means.
187
Chapter 8: Nano-fying Electronics

Such nanosensors work because atoms or molecules bond to the surface of
the nanotube — and thereby change its electrical characteristics in telltale
ways. As you might expect, the sensitivity of the sensor depends on how
much surface area is exposed to the gas — and as miniscule things go, the
surface of a nanotube is pretty big. Just as a grain of sand has more surface
area relative to its volume than a huge rock has, nano-scale materials have a
bigger surface area (relative to volume) than other materials used to sense
chemicals. There’s an even better reason, however, to use nano-scale materi-
als for sensing chemicals: A very small amount of a chemical can change
their conductance. So (on the molecular scale, at least) the relatively large
surface area of the big honkin’ carbon nanotube makes it sensitive to smaller
traces of the chemical you’re sampling. In the next section, we discuss how
you sense these changes in conductance of the nanotubes.
Detecting chemicals in the real world
One interesting application of these nanosensors is the detection of trace
levels of vapors from explosives. Because most explosives are made of mole-
cules containing nitrogen dioxide (NO2), nanosensors may be able to detect
trace amounts of those vapors. This potentially greater sensitivity might
eventually help airport security personnel detect (for example) bombs in 
luggage.
But the road to efficient nanosensors isn’t without potholes. Before we can
put these sensors into use, we have to solve one problem: It’s not always
easy to determine what molecule you’ve detected. That’s because (in princi-
ple) any molecule that can bond to the carbon nanotube and contribute or
remove an electron — even if it isn’t the one you’re looking for — could cause
the sensor to respond.
For that reason, researchers are investigating how to “tell” the sensor what to
look for by coating the nanotube with various materials. Any sensor based on
a coated nanotube is responsive only to certain chemicals — for example,
coating the nanotubes with a polymer called polyethyleneimine (don’t even
try to pronounce that one) allows the sensor to detect NO2 but minimizes its
sensitivity to NH3. Coating nanotubes with a different polymer called nafion
stops NO2 from getting through — but allows the sensor to detect NH3.
But how does the sensor measure the change in the nanotube’s conductance
once it detects a chemical? Well, a quick look at a simple device that uses
carbon nanotubes as a sensing element (a chemiresistor) shows how: In a
chemiresistor, carbon nanotubes are laid between metal electrodes; you
apply a constant voltage between those two electrodes. If the conductance of
the carbon nanotubes remains constant, the resulting electrical current also
remains constant. If the conductance of the carbon nanotube — and there-
fore the current — changes, then a chemical is present that caused the change.
188

The surface area — and presumably the sensitivity — of this type of detector
is increased by constructing each electrode in the shape of multiple “fingers.”
You then interleave the fingers from the two electrodes and lay carbon nano-
tubes between the interleaved fingers, as shown in Figure 8-3. A sensor of this
type can detect NO2 levels of less than 50 parts per billion.
Biosensors
If sensors can detect chemical vapors in the air, it’s not much of a stretch to
imagine sensors — designed along the same nanotechnological principles —
that would be able to detect biological molecules or viruses in the air. In fact,

Chapter 8: Nano-fying Electronics
Chemiresistor variations
A group at UC Davis is experimenting with
chemiresistors that use nanowires — very tiny
wires made from metals (such as silver) or
semiconductors (such as silicon) instead of the
carbon you’d see in nanotubes — but produce
similar results. Meanwhile, the Naval Research
Laboratory is working on a chemiresistor-based
chemical-vapor sensor that uses gold nanopar-
ticles. The idea here is that molecules that
intrude between the gold nanoparticles change
the resistance that the sensor can detect.
Another method uses a field-effect transistor
(FET), as described in Chapter 6. Using this
method, only the top side of the carbon nan-
otube is open, and that’s the only place chemi-
cals have contact with the nanotube. (If you are
familiar enough with transistors to ask where
the gate of the transistor is, it’s on the back of
the device.) The conductance of the carbon
nanotube changes as a result of contact with
the chemical vapor — which in turn changes
the gain of the transistor — and the chemical is
caught in the act of being there.

we’re on such a roll here that we’re going to consider such variations small
fry and move on to something really cool. How about creating biosensors
that can be used in the bloodstream? Because you could use this technology
to sense various medical conditions in people, this is an area of particular
interest to medical science.
Paradoxically, it’s a huge challenge to determine what causes a tiny change in
the conductance of a sensor element introduced into the bloodstream. This
is because many of the molecules, viruses, and proteins zipping through it
are electrically charged — their molecules have either more or fewer elec-
trons than protons. This charge can be transferred to the sensor element,
creating noise — electrical interference — that makes it hard for the sensor
to pick out the signal it’s looking for. To solve this problem, we’ll have to
develop coatings or other methods that limit what can reach the sensor ele-
ment. (Biosensors are discussed in more depth in Chapter 10.)
In his book Prey, sci-fi author Michael Crichton depicted a future with
nanosensors running amok all over the place. But don’t worry: Creating
swarms of nanosensors to ruin your next picnic is still a ways in the future.
Nanosensors are still a new development; they aren’t cheap, but at some
point their cost is going to come down. When it comes down far enough, we
can indeed deploy these tiny machines in swarms. Then they can act in 
force, backing each other up in what scientists like to call a higher level of
redundancy — which can make them much more effective.
Mechanizing the Micro World
A couple of centuries after the Industrial Revolution, our world is full of
machines — ranging from simple to complex, from motors in cars to 
decision-making robots. Where does nanotechnology fit into mechanics?
There’s one little acronym that holds great promise in this area: MEMS.
Micro-electromechanical 
machines (MEMS)
A micro-electromechanical system, or MEMS, is, logically enough, a mechanical
system or machine that exists at the micro level. To quantify sizes down
there, the best unit of measurement is the micrometer (“micro-meter,” not
“mi-crom-eter,” which is an everyday-size precision tool). This unit, often
referred to as the micron, equals one millionth of a meter (about one hun-
dredth the width of a human hair). Imagine machines built to the scale of
microns. As with many more familiar machines, a MEMS might have gears,
motors, levers, bearings, and so on that are capable of moving things — say,
adjust a very tiny mirror to shine a pinprick of light on a flat-panel TV display.
190

If you’ve been paying attention to the details of the nano-size world, you may
be asking yourself, why are they talking about micro-electromechanical sys-
tems, when they should be talking about nano-electromechanical systems?
Well, for openers, right now nobody can make nano-scale electromechanical
systems. (Details, details.) Remember, a nanometer is one billionth of a meter
in size — way smaller than a micrometer. But it’s quite possible that by using
micro systems we can build smaller and smaller elements to help us reach
the nano level some day.
How MEMS work
So how are people building MEMS today? Well, traditional manufacturing
techniques that you might use to build a regular motor just won’t handle
micro-scale precision work. Instead, folks are rolling out the same techniques
used to make computer chips. Using that approach, eventually we can make
these devices in large quantities (potentially in the millions), at low cost, and
with uniform performance. At the end of the manufacturing process, instead
of having a chip that processes information, you have a mechanical chip — a
nano-scale machine that performs an action.
It’s entirely possible to have a MEMS chip that contains an information-
processing component as well as a mechanical component. For example, 
you might create circuitry to analyze signals from a sensor on the same 
chip that controls a mechanical device.
How people are using MEMS
Even this early in the nano story, folks have applied MEMS techniques to a
variety of sensors. One example is an accelerometer (a sensor that detects
sudden changes in speed) — handy in applications such as release mecha-
nisms for car airbags. The MEMS version of the accelerometer uses a silicon
shaft that holds a weight. One side of a capacitor is built into the shaft. When
the acceleration changes, the shaft bends, and this changes its capacitance.
The electrical circuit in the chip measures that change in capacitance — and
determines the amount of acceleration. This type of accelerometer has the
necessary precision to trigger automotive air bags in a collision, and is
already in use — at a cost that’s about 80 to 90 percent lower than for con-
ventional accelerometers.
Another MEMS application is already in extensive use in medical settings:
MEMS-based blood-pressure sensors. As with standard pressure sensors,
these measure the movement of a diaphragm built into the device — but
they’re also disposable. Such sensors can be used at a small fraction of the
cost of more traditional pressure sensors — and the use-once-and-throw-
away approach is often safer if the patient has a highly infectious disease.
But MEMS don’t have to just sit around sensing things; they can also manipu-
late or move things around. One of the few commercial applications currently
marketed concerns MEMS chips that contain an array of microscopic mir-
rors. These mirrors act as optical switches that produce the picture in many
191
Chapter 8: Nano-fying Electronics

large-screen TVs. Each mirror is assigned a 1 or 0 (on or off) — just like a
memory cell. Electrostatic forces can then cause each mirror to either align
so it transmits light to the TV screen (lighting up a pixel) or to move out of
alignment (darkening a pixel).
Researchers are busy developing all kinds of MEMS that can manipulate tiny
objects. Figure 8-4 shows a MEMS transmission (basically a bunch of gears)
that takes the output of a microengine on a chip and then manipulates
another object on the same chip.

In Figure 8-5, you can see that the output of the MEMS transmission is con-
nected to a hinged mirror. The microengine is capable of adjusting the angle
of the mirror.
Building computer brains from molecules
All we need now are some tiny brains (no cheap remarks, please) to go with
the tiny fingers . . . and we’re partway there already: Computer chips have
been miraculously shrinking over the years to become more powerful. But as
the components of chips — stuff like transistors, diodes, and memory cells —
continue to shrink, there’s less distance between those components; the
increased density in the chip creates problems. Nanotechnology may take us
the rest of the way to creating computer chips based on molecular-scale
devices (or even smaller nano-devices) that can solve many of these 
problems.

So, what’s the problem?
Everybody wants small, powerful, fast computer chips — but making them
smaller is a tricky business. A few of the biggest problems with shrinking
computer chips are
 Noise: Leakage of electrons from one device — a transistor, for 
example — to another or from one part of a device to another. As the
thickness of the insulating layers is reduced, their effectiveness is also
reduced. This shrinkage increases leakage of electrons and produces
electrical “noise” in the circuit.
 Heat: Generation of heat from having so many transistors and other
devices in one small space.
 Cost: As the feature size of components shrinks, the cost of manufactur-
ing equipment used to create the components increases.
How nano can help
Building transistors and other devices used in computer chips either from
organic molecules (see the next section for more about these) or from
nanowires, nanotubes, and nanoparticles the size of a molecule may be a way
to minimize these problems. This technique is called molecular electronics.
Nanotechnology may allow us to simply pack more onto each computer chip.

mission.

Chapter 8: Nano-fying Electronics

Here are some of the projected benefits of molecular electronics:
 Quieter: Reduced leakage of electrons (which happens because elec-
trons in molecules are confined to certain orbitals and energy levels)
means less electronic noise. Scientists believe that, even when a molecu-
lar transistor is turned on and current (that is, a stream of electrons) is
flowing, the electrons travel within overlapping orbitals that end up con-
trolling their movement and keeping them where they belong.
 Cooler: Reduced heat is one result of lowering the number of electrons
used by the devices. Tens of thousands of electrons are currently used
to turn a memory cell on and off (changing it from a 0 to a 1); but a mole-
cular memory cell will probably need fewer than 100 electrons to change
its state.
 Cheaper: Lower cost can result from the use of batching processes
(such as those used in chemistry) to produce molecular computer
chips. If successful, this technique could significantly reduce the cost of
manufacturing equipment.
Using organic molecules
Organic molecules, also called hydrocarbons, make up the solid (as opposed
to liquid) portions of living things (that is, people, animals, and plants), as
well as certain materials such as plastic and oil. The number of carbon and
hydrogen atoms bonded together into different shapes with other atoms
(such as nitrogen or oxygen) can vary in organic molecules.
The difference between your dog Sparky and your plastic credit card is just
the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms, the types of atoms that are
tacked on, and the way the atoms are bonded together in the molecule.
These factors, in combination, determine the properties of any organic mole-
cule. (Okay, Sparky is cuter, too, and won’t fit in your wallet.)
Two major requirements for using organic molecules in molecular computing
are important for you to get your mind around:
 Electrons have to be able to flow easily through a molecule.
 You have to be able to turn the flow of electrons on and off.
Electrons flowing freely
In some organic molecules, the electrons are organized in orbitals in such a
way that they can travel between the atoms in the molecule. These gad-
abouts are called delocalized electrons (like those that exist in metals).
Benzene, for example — a molecule that’s a ring of six carbon atoms (see
Figure 8-6) — has delocalized electrons. Organic molecules that contain these
delocalized electrons meet the first requirement of molecular electronics —
they allow the free flow of electrons, God bless their little hearts.
194
Part III: “Smarter” Computers! Faster Internet! Cheaper Energy! 

Turning the flow on and off
A lamp you can’t turn on and off isn’t much use. Uncontrolled electrons are
sort of the same way. The second requirement of molecular electronics is
that you have to be able to turn the flow of electrons on and off. Fortunately,
researchers have done that with organic molecules — in particular, a mole-
cule in which three benzene rings are connected in a line; delocalized elec-
trons can move within all three benzene rings. Change the center benzene
ring a little (by adding nitrous dioxide to one side and ammonia to another
side), and you skew the electron orbitals in the center benzene ring so
they’re asymmetrical — preventing the electrons from moving from one ring
to another. In this way you can block (turn off) the flow of electrons.
By applying an electric field, you can untwist that benzene ring like a faucet
handle and allow electrons to flow. What you’ve got here is an electrically
operated switch like the one shown in Figure 8-7.
Okay, what about other tiny components? Hmm . . . tricky. To create (for
example) a molecular transistor that’s equivalent to the standard transistors
shown in Figure 8-7, researchers have to determine how to turn the flow of
electrons on and off by applying a voltage directly to part of the molecule,
rather than applying an electric field indirectly to the whole thing.
Adding things to molecules
One way to change an ordinary molecule into a component of a tiny machine
is to add a specific number of specific atoms to it — just here, just there, just
so. Adding parts to a molecule is essentially what chemists do when they
make new materials. Certain molecules in a chemical reaction exchange
atoms or groups of atoms with certain other molecules to produce new mole-
cules. The chemist “merely” figures out what molecules to mix together
under what conditions to produce a new molecule, and then devises proce-
dures to separate the molecule of interest from the entire brew. Chemical
reactions are done as batch processes. If we figure out how to create molecu-
lar devices, we’ll be using batch chemical processes to create them as well.

Using nanotubes and nanowires
Nanotubes and nanowires are getting a lot of attention for a variety of elec-
tronic applications. Nanotubes are cylinders of carbon atoms; nanowires 
are tiny wires made from metals such as silver or semiconductors such as 
silicon.
Researchers have already created memory devices using nanotubes and
nanowires. (See Chapter 6 for more about this.) Eventually the computer
industry may be able to replace memory cells that are about a hundred
nanometers wide with cells that are only a few nanometers wide. Hewlett-
Packard (for example) recently found a way to use nanowires to construct a
device — only a few nanometers wide — that performs electrical operations
normally requiring at least two transistors. This device, a special combina-
tion of three nanowires, is called a crossbar latch. Crossbar latches can
replace the transistors used today with nano-scale devices that do the work
of transistors.

Do it yourself: Self-assembly
Of all the features of molecules that scientists are eager to emulate, one will
probably do the most to make construction of a molecular computer easier:
self-assembly. It’s a pretty simple phenomenon: When molecules bond
together, they just naturally determine their proper orientation. No fuss, 
no muss.
One example of how self-assembly could be used in the construction of a
molecular computer looks like this: Suppose you attach a sulfur atom to one
end of a molecule designed as a transistor or other computer component. It
turns out (who knew?) that sulfur attaches itself to gold. If you place a solu-
tion containing a molecular device on gold-coated material, the sulfur end of
each molecule in the device attaches itself to the gold surface. You end up
with an array of these molecules sticking up from the gold surface like minia-
ture blades of grass, as seen in Figure 8-8.
But the molecules don’t plunk down at random on the gold surface — rather,
they line up in regularly spaced rows and columns. Okay, assuming there’s no
miniscule drill sergeant down there (“All you sulfur slackers, ten-HUT!”), what
gives?
Well, the answer’s repulsive. Really. In Chapter 3 we talk about the fact that
electrons repel each other — and that the repulsive force between them
helps determine the shape of an atom. Following that line of thinking, when
you put a gold-coated surface in a solution containing these molecules, they
all rush toward the gold. As the molecules get closer to the surface, however,
the electrons surrounding each molecule push each other away.
Solution
Self-assembly

Chapter 8: Nano-fying Electronics

Researchers are investigating atoms other than sulfur that bind to different
metal or semiconductor surfaces. Using this property of self-assembly should
enable us to program each end of a molecular device to attach to a different
type of surface. Result: components.
Here’s another neat self-assembly trick. Let’s say you’ve built several differ-
ent types of molecular devices that you want to attach to various portions of
a computer chip. You apply a voltage to a portion of the chip while it’s
immersed in a solution that contains one type of molecular device. The
devices attach to the area of the chip where you’re applying the voltage.
Anna Belcher is leading a team of researchers at the University of Texas to
take another path to a self-assembly process, using some tricks from biology.
They have found proteins that will bond to certain metals or semiconductors
and are using this capability, along with the ability of proteins to assemble
into structures such as an abalone shell, to develop a self-assembly process
for computer chips.
Wire it up
Once we figure out how to make all these molecular transistors or memory
cells, we still have one more problem to address: How do you connect these
things together or connect them to an external circuit?
Nope, this is one time duct tape won’t work. What’s needed is a type of wire
that has a diameter of no more than a few nanometers. You then have to be
able to connect that wire to the molecular transistors or memory cells. (And
if you’ve skimmed this book, you know better than to grab the tweezers to do
this.)
Nanotubes and nanowires are likely candidates because they can be made
only a few nanometers wide and can conduct electricity. Nanotubes can be
either metallic or semiconductor-like — so one piece of this puzzle is to sort
out the metallic nanotubes to use for this particular application.
Another candidate for connecting molecular transistors or memory cells is
conductive organic molecules, called molecular wires. Molecular wires are
strings of molecules whose atoms have orbitals that allow delocalized elec-
trons. Studious types at Rice University have been looking into the proce-
dures required to synthesize molecular wires. When you bond a bunch 
of conductive organic molecules together, you produce a much longer 
molecule — in which the orbitals allow electrons to travel the entire length of
the molecule. Another way of saying this: The molecule conducts electricity.

Whether you’re using a nanotube or molecular wire, sulfur (or some other
atoms that bond to specific metals) is applied to each end to attach the 
molecule to metal surfaces or other devices (see the earlier section “Do it
yourself: Self-assembly” to understand how this works).
There’s still a lot of work ahead of us, however, before we find ways to route
molecular-scale wires (whether nanotubes, nanowires, or organic molecules)
to specific devices and then on to the next device required to complete the
circuit. But the methods discussed in this chapter provide the groundwork
for these cool applications of nanotechnology. Build it, and it (whatever nano
device you have in mind) will come.

 Cleaning up the environment with nanotechnology
T
he world is a populous place, and mankind has a tendency to use up
energy on everything from heating our homes to driving to work. Just
imagine if we had unlimited energy to fulfill the needs of these billions upon
billions of people. With unlimited energy, we could effectively desalinate
water from the oceans to irrigate crops, greatly expanding our food supply.
We could get beyond our dependence on a shrinking supply of fossil fuels,
whose use can harm our environment. Nanotechnology may well be the key
that allows us to not only efficiently utilize our current resources, but also
create additional sources of energy and help our struggling environment.
In this chapter, we take a look at ways we can use nanotechnology to produce
energy with more cost-effective solar cells, more efficient hydrogen produc-
tion, better storage possibilities for hydrogen fuel cells, and more efficient
batteries. You get a look at using nanocatalysts to support chemical reac-
tions, and glimpse how nanotechnology may improve our air and water 
supplies.
The Energy Challenge
A limitless supply of energy is our new Holy Grail. The future of our expand-
ing, technology-based society depends on our finding that Grail. Don’t believe
us? Check out Figure 9-1, which illustrates how the projected demands on the
world’s energy resources will soon exceed the supply unless non-fossil-based
sources of energy increase significantly.

The energy problem needs to be fixed, and soon — and nanotechnology may
be the tool we can use to fix it. Using nanotechnology we can explore a vari-
ety of alternate sources of energy, from solar cells to hydrogen fuel cells to
nano-efficient batteries.
Using Nanotechnology to Make 
Solar Cells Affordable
When light hits a solar cell, an electric current is generated. When you punch
numbers into a calculator without inserting a battery or plugging it into the
wall, you’re taking advantage of solar cells.
Today, people typically use solar cells in places where they can’t use stan-
dard electrical outlets — say, in sailboats or satellites. Solar cells are also
used in small machines like calculators where frequently replacing batteries
is inconvenient and costly, and the amount of power required from the solar
cells is so small that they aren’t too expensive to produce.
Solar-cell sticker shock
Where the cost of solar cells gets prohibitive is in larger installations. Though
there may be a family in your town using solar cells to power their home’s
heat or lights, this is still a pretty rare scenario. That’s because it’s not yet
affordable to “go solar” in any big way. Manufacturing and installation costs
are such that anyone actually using solar is probably doing so on principle or
because they’re off the grid.

But why is it so costly to make solar cells today? The answer to this one is
pretty much a no-brainer: A solar cell is made with semiconductor material,
which presently requires expensive equipment and high temperatures (sev-
eral hundred degrees centigrade). This expensive manufacturing process
drives up the cost of the solar cell. In fact, when you figure out the cost of
electricity generated by the solar cell over its lifetime, you’re looking at about
40 cents per kilowatt hour. This cost is several times the rate your power
company is charging you (rates vary depending on where you live, but for
one of us, a recent bill came in at under 8 cents per kilowatt hour — which
isn’t unusual).
The potential of nano solar cells
Various companies are using nanotechnology to reduce the cost of making
solar cells to the point where solar cells can compete with . . . the power you
buy from your local utility company. These nano-style solar cells use semi-
conducting nanotubes, nanowires, or nanoparticles embedded in a conduc-
tive plastic. These cells work just like the solar cells currently available —
but they cost much less to manufacture.
For example, a company called Nanosolar, Inc., is developing solar cells using
a method that sprays or prints the layers of a solar cell onto a surface, much
the way an ink-jet printer sprays ink onto a page. Nanosolar claims that not
only is this process lower in cost than current solar cell manufacturing meth-
ods, but the resulting solar cells will be considerably thinner and lighter. The
lighter weight will make it easier to cover an entire roof with solar cells.
Another company, Konarka Technology, Inc., is developing solar cells that
use titanium oxide nanocrystals embedded in plastic. These cells can be
used in devices like laptops and cellphones.
Konarka has also demonstrated a process to make fabrics that work as solar
cells. The solar cells that you can fit into a jacket in the near future will prob-
ably provide a small trickle of electricity, about enough to keep the battery
for your cellphone charged. But consider other possibilities: With such a
fabric you could make a tent that could provide a convenient light source
when you’re camping in the woods.
Another application suggested by Nanosys, Inc., involves installing solar cells
between the glass panes of windows. Solar cells for this application would
probably have to be transparent. Get this approach to work, and all the win-
dows in a giant skyscraper could power every office in the building.
203
Chapter 9: Getting Energy and a Cleaner Environment with Nanotech

How, exactly, do nano solar cells 
get built?
Quite a few companies are racing to get their share of the marketplace for
less expensive solar cells, but how will they get there?
Different companies are pursuing different nanotechnological approaches to
developing solar cells, but the general idea is the same for all. When light hits
an atom in a semiconductor, those photons of light with lots of energy can
push an electron out of its nice stable orbital around the atom. The electron
is then free to move from atom to atom, like the electrons in a piece of metal
when it conducts electricity.
Using nano-size bits of semiconductor (we discuss semiconductors in Chap-
ter 3) embedded in a conductive plastic maximizes the chance that an elec-
tron can escape the nanoparticle and reach the conductive plastic before it is
“trapped” by another atom that has also been stripped of an electron. Once in
the plastic, the electron can travel happily through wires connecting the solar
cell to your gadget (cellphone, laptop, or whatever). It can then wander back
to the nanocrystal to join an atom that has a positive charge. (For the semi-
conductor physicists among you, this is called electron hole recombination.)
Figure 9-2 illustrates the workings of a solar cell that uses nanotechnology.
Making Hydrogen Fuel Cells
Here’s a power source, long used in spacecraft, brought down to earth: A
hydrogen fuel cell takes oxygen and hydrogen and generates electricity and
water. Hydrogen fuel cells could potentially prove to be a great power source
because they don’t pollute the air. But current methods of producing hydro-
gen do pollute the air. Another challenge with hydrogen fuel cells is the 
problem of hydrogen storage. If we could only store sufficient volumes of
hydrogen in a tank in a car, for example, we could power cars more cleanly.

Before we get to efficient production and use of hydrogen fuel cells, we have
to solve these problems.
It’s a matter of density
If you have a supply of liquefied dinosaur remains handy (petroleum, to you),
you’ll be glad to know that this material has a major advantage over many
electric and mechanical storage systems. Petroleum, from which we also pro-
duce gasoline, has serious energy density — it generates a lot of power from a
compact volume of material.
For example, the amount of energy stored in a gallon of gasoline, pound for
pound, is more than six times the amount of energy stored in most batteries.
When designing a car, it’s a good idea to minimize the weight and volume of
fuel required. That’s why car designers are hesitant to switch to electric cars:
A tank of gas weighs only a fraction of the weight of the batteries you need to
take a car the same distance. On top of that, you can fill up your car with gas
in minutes; most batteries take hours to charge.
Of all the alternatives to fossil fuels, hydrogen gas provides the soundest
solution. Hydrogen gas combusts to form water — a benign environmental
element — and its energy density is reasonably close to that of petroleum.
When you add that it can be derived from salt water — one of the most plen-
tiful resources on the planet — it becomes a very appealing option.
Putting hydrogen into production
We’re going to need nanotechnology to improve two major components of
the hydrogen fuel-cell system if we’re ever going to make fuel cells usable in
our cars. The first component that needs major improvement involves actu-
ally producing the hydrogen with which to fuel the cells.
The method most often used to produce hydrogen today is called steam
reforming. This method uses natural gas — and generates air pollution in the
form of carbon dioxide. Another method called electrolysis uses electricity to
produce hydrogen from water. Electrolysis (not to be confused with hair
removal) does not produce any air pollution in itself, but you have to get the
electricity from somewhere — generally from coal, oil, or natural-gas power
plants that do generate air pollution.
Nanotechnology researchers are trying to develop a cleaner method of pro-
ducing hydrogen. Curious? Read on to get the full story.
205
Chapter 9: Getting Energy and a Cleaner Environment with Nanotech

Producing hydrogen with photoelectrochemical cells
One method of producing hydrogen has been tagged with a lengthy name:
photoelectrochemical hydrogen production.
The working part of a photoelectrochemical-hydrogen-production device is a
layer of nanoparticles, roughly 30nm in diameter, placed on a conducting
glass layer, as shown in Figure 9-3. The nanoparticles are composed of a semi-
conducting metal oxide (say, an oxide formed of titanium). The conducting
glass plate is connected to a metal electrode located a small distance from
the layer of nanoparticles. You fill the space between the electrode and
nanoparticles with water. Water seeps into the space between the nanoparti-
cles, providing the most possible surface contact between the semiconduct-
ing metal oxide and the water. (Read the nearby sidebar for more about why
this is important.)
To get a handle on how a photoelectrochemical cell works, think for a
moment about the way electrons move: Light strikes a layer of nanoparticles,
knocking electrons loose from some atoms — just like what happens inside a
solar cell. Those electrons move through the conducting glass layer to the
metal electrode and place a negative charge on it.
So now you have a layer of nanoparticles that electrons are rushing out of —
and a nearby metal electrode that electrons are rushing into. Water filling the
space between the two interacts with the electrons, producing hydrogen.
In practice, the photoelectrochemical cell needs a little help to make a reac-
tion occur. By attaching a solar cell, you can provide the extra energy
required to the electrons in the photoelectrochemical cell.
By this process, a photoelectrochemical cell makes hydrogen from water and
sunlight. Various researchers believe that this is the near-ideal model for
replacing the current method of using natural gas to produce hydrogen. In
fact, one company, Hydrogen Solar, Ltd., is building an experimental power
plant in Las Vegas, Nevada, to demonstrate just this process.

If you really want to know . . .
There are other fuels besides gasoline with high
energy densities — some right under your nose.
Animal fat is very dense in energy, and has been
used to power some unique prototype vehicles.
Even a combination of urine and pickling vine-
gar can get you from Point A to Point B if you’re
desperate enough (after all, somebody was
desperate enough to invent the method). But
there’s no reason to get that desperate: Just
wait ten or so years and nano may bring you a
far less odorous solution.

Chapter 9: Getting Energy and a Cleaner Environment with Nanotech
Producing hydrogen: Behind the scenes
If you have a truly scientific bent, you may want
some more details about the Photoelectro-
chemical Cell method of producing hydrogen.
Water happens to be composed of two hydro-
gen atoms and one oxygen atom. (Remember
H20 from Chemistry 101?) The only reason these
atoms stay together in a molecule is because
they have this primal urge to share electrons. In
photoelectrochemical cells, some of the water
molecules touching the metal-oxide nanoparti-
cles give up electrons to replace those knocked
out of the metal-oxide atoms by the photons.
Rather than just resting on the surface of 
the metal oxide, water fills the entire space
between the nanoparticles — making more
water molecules available to give up electrons,
which speeds up the photoelectrochemical
process.
While water molecules are giving up electrons
to the metal-oxide nanoparticles, the water mol-
ecule breaks up into atoms. Because hydrogen
atoms have a weaker hold on electrons than the
oxygen atoms, you end up with hydrogen atoms
that have no electrons — ions — in which their
remaining protons give them a positive charge.
Because unlike charges attract, the negatively
charged metal electrode pulls these hydrogen
ions over to it. When the hydrogen ions reach
the electrode, each one grabs an electron and
becomes a neutral hydrogen atom. Then, two by
two, these atoms combine to produce mole-
cules of hydrogen. As a byproduct, this process
also produces oxygen.

Producing hydrogen with designer molecules
Plants — the biological kind — are pretty smart creatures in the way they
work. A plant takes in sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water, and releases
oxygen. Scientists have been looking at the process that plants use to pro-
duce oxygen to see whether we can emulate it.
So what happens inside the plant? When a molecule called chlorophyll
absorbs sunlight, electrons in the chlorophyll are pushed from their orbitals.
The electrons, water, and carbon dioxide react to form sugar through the
process of photosynthesis. The plant uses this sugar as food — and produces,
as a byproduct, the oxygen we breathe every day. At the end of this process,
the chlorophyll molecule is unchanged — it can go back to help change other
water and carbon dioxide molecules into sugar and oxygen.
A molecule like chlorophyll that assists in a reaction but is unchanged by it
and hangs around to assist other molecules in the reaction is called a catalyst.
Researchers are attempting to design molecules that absorb sunlight and
produce hydrogen from water, just as chlorophyll produces oxygen from
water. At Virginia Tech, some folks have noted that molecules containing
atoms of ruthenium can absorb light and produce electrons, so they put an
atom of ruthenium at each end of a designer molecule. They also put an atom
of rhodium in the center of the molecule to transfer electrons to water. They
filled out the structure of their designer molecule with atoms of carbon,
hydrogen, chlorine, and nitrogen — and came up with a molecule that pro-
duces hydrogen from sunlight and water, just as chlorophyll produces
oxygen.
Although still in the laboratory stages, this research holds out the promise of
using a clean process — similar to one in nature — to produce hydrogen for
generating energy.
208
Part III: “Smarter” Computers! Faster Internet! Cheaper Energy! 
Who are ruthenium and rhodium 
when they’re at home?
What are ruthenium and rhodium and how 
do researchers put this designer molecule
together? Ruthenium and rhodium are two
singing sisters who . . . just kidding . . . actually
they’re both metals that are similar to platinum.
One reason you may not have heard of them is
that they are so scarce that they cost more to
obtain than gold or platinum. Researchers put
this designer molecule together by causing a
chemical reaction between different molecules
that they want to combine. But this is not some-
thing for you to try at home: It typically takes
researchers several experiments and some-
times years of work to figure out how to build a
designer molecule.

Storing hydrogen
Hydrogen fuel cells pose one other major problem to nanotechnology
researchers: After we’ve generated hydrogen, exactly how do we store it? If
hydrogen fuel cells are to be effective in automobiles, hydrogen storage sys-
tems should store 6 percent (by weight) of hydrogen compared to the weight
of the storage tank. In addition, you should be able to remove the hydrogen
easily when you need it. Now, conventional methods store hydrogen as a
compressed gas or as a liquid. To store enough of it to power a car (in these
forms, anyway), you’d need a tank the size of Rhode Island. (Okay, maybe not
that big, but it would definitely be too heavy and too large to put in your
Chevy.)
Researchers are attempting to develop lightweight, compact solid materials
that do the same job as a storage tank: These materials would absorb hydro-
gen the way a sponge absorbs water, and hold it (without leaking) until you
need it. Theoretically, these materials could be refilled with hydrogen in a
reasonable amount of time (perhaps about ten minutes) and be reused many
times.
Although materials exist that currently perform this role, they only store
about 1 percent of hydrogen by weight (versus the 6-percent-by-weight
required). Researchers are looking at using nanoparticles to enhance the
properties of existing solids — as well as the possibility of developing
entirely new materials.
One such new material that has been proposed to store hydrogen is made of
carbon nanotubes. Experimental results at this point are mixed; the reasons
for these differences aren’t clear. For example, researchers at the National
Renewable Energy Laboratory have reported that carbon nanotubes, in the
presence of certain metals, can hold 8 percent by weight hydrogen; other
results report achieving only 1 percent. Work will continue to optimize the
ability of porous materials that contain nanotubes to store hydrogen — and
to understand why these experiments get different results (so far).
209
Chapter 9: Getting Energy and a Cleaner Environment with Nanotech
It starts out efficient, but then . . .
Researchers at the Max Planck Institute are
trying to improve the ability of existing mate-
rials to store hydrogen. They added titanium
nanoparticles to a substance called sodium alu-
minum hydride — and improved its ability to
absorb and store hydrogen. The modified mate-
rial absorbs 4.5 percent of hydrogen, about 40
times faster than sodium metal hydride itself.
Refilling this material with hydrogen would take
about 15 minutes. There are still issues to be
resolved; for example, after 17 cycles of filling
and emptying the material of hydrogen, fill-up
time slows way down to about 45 minutes.

Using Nanotechnology 
to Energize Batteries
Of all batteries currently in use, the lithium-ion type stores the most electrical
power for its weight. The bad news is that (for now, at least) you can only use
this type of battery in things like watches and laptop computers. These are
devices that do not have sudden demands for a lot of power, as do power
tools. No surprise that researchers are using nanotechnology to improve
lithium-ion batteries so they can be used in more devices.
When a battery runs your radio or other gadget, the reaction of chemicals in
the battery transfers electrons to the anode — a piece of metal that makes up
the negative terminal of the battery. Those electrons become the electric cur-
rent that powers your gadget. One way to improve batteries is to make the
anode out of material that lets you maximize its surface area.
In a lithium-ion battery, the anode is currently made of carbon. Altair
Nanotechnologies, Inc., is developing an improved lithium-ion battery that
replaces the carbon anode with one made up of lithium titanate nanocrystals.
An anode made up of these nanocrystals provides about 30 times greater sur-
face area than one made up of carbon. If the anode has greater surface area,
electrons come out of the battery faster; this means that a higher electric 
current — therefore more power — is available to run your gadget.
If electrons can leave a battery faster, they can also go back in faster, trim-
ming the time it takes to recharge the battery. Assume it takes an hour to
recharge your battery-powered drill, and that you have to get a new battery
after only 500 charges. Altair Nanotechnologies projects that you can
recharge their nano-batteries in a few minutes, and the batteries will last for
several thousand recharges.
Toshiba’s researchers announced, as we’re writing this chapter, that they
have used nanoparticles in developing a lithium-ion battery that recharges to
80 percent of its capacity in one minute. Toshiba stated that a prototype of
this battery has been discharged and recharged 1000 times with only a 1-per-
cent decrease in its capacity. The only details Toshiba has released is that
nanoparticles are used in the anode.
Such developments should allow us to replace current batteries (not only
lightweight lithium-ion batteries, but also more powerful batteries such as
nickel-metal-hydride ones) with lighter-weight models that recharge faster.
For those of you who travel with laptops, you’ll be happy to hear that this
should significantly reduce the amount of time your battery needs to
recharge before you head off to that next (inevitable) meeting.

Using Nanotechnology to Reduce 
Energy Consumption
It’s sad but true: Much of the energy produced in the world is wasted. For
example, a light bulb may produce light, but it also produces heat — which
may be fine in winter but a total waste on a hot August day. Other processes
take more energy than may be necessary to make them happen. Making gaso-
line, for example, requires applying heat to petroleum to cause a reaction.
Finding ways to save energy in these processes is important to reducing our
energy consumption. The following sections highlight some of the more
promising nano-paths researchers are taking in trying to keep energy con-
sumption down.
Producing light with nanotechnology
Actually only about 5 or 10 percent of the power from an electric current run-
ning through an incandescent light bulb generates light; about 90 percent is
spent generating heat. Researchers are projecting that light bulbs made with
quantum dots (nanocrystals that emit visible light when exposed to ultravio-
let light, as described in Chapter 8) will turn almost 100 percent of the power
from electricity into light. With quantum dot bulbs, very little energy will be
wasted as unneeded heat.
Given that about 20 percent of the electric power consumed in the world is
used to generate light, adopting light bulbs based on quantum dots could
cause significant reduction in overall energy consumption worldwide.
211
Chapter 9: Getting Energy and a Cleaner Environment with Nanotech
It just keeps on going
Another company, mPhase Technologies, is
using carbon nanotubes to develop batteries
with a very long shelf life. A normal battery, even
when not supplying current, has some reactions
going on at a low level between its internal
chemicals and its electrodes — and those
reduce its ability to deliver electric current
when you need it. That’s why mPhase is devel-
oping a battery that contains nanotubes
attached to the surface of the electrodes. The
chemicals (in liquid form in this case) rest on the
top of the nanotubes, which are held in place by
surface tension. Because the nanotubes keep
the chemicals separate from the electrodes, no
reaction takes place — so there’s no degrada-
tion of battery power. When you need current
from the battery, you apply a voltage, which
causes the liquid chemical to drop between the
nanotubes and reach the electrodes: Voilà!
You’ve got power!!

Using nanocatalysts to make chemicals
Another way in which nanotechnology has an opportunity to reduce energy
consumption is in the production of chemicals. Catalysts have been tradition-
ally used to reduce the amount of energy required during chemical reactions.
Using nanotechnology, we can create even more efficient catalysts and save
even more energy.
Using catalysts to use less energy
Often, when molecules are formed in a chemical reaction, energy — usually in
the form of heat — is needed to break apart the atoms in the incoming mole-
cules and rearrange them into new molecules. The brute-force method is to
add enough heat so the molecules smash into each other, breaking off part of
one molecule so it can bond to another molecule. This reaction forms the
new molecule you want to produce.
Chemists have long used catalysts to reduce the amount of energy needed to
make a reaction work. An example of a traditional catalyst that can be used in
this way is the platinum you find in the catalytic converter in your car. The
platinum assists in the reaction that converts poisonous carbon monoxide
and nitric oxide to less-harmful carbon dioxide and nitrogen. Here’s how this
works: When nitric oxide lands on platinum, the nitrogen atoms and the
oxygen atoms bond to the platinum atoms, breaking up the nitric oxide mole-
cule. The nitrogen atoms are then free to bond with other nitrogen atoms and
are released as nitrogen gas. The oxygen atoms bond with carbon monoxide
molecules that have attached to the surface of the platinum — and the result
is carbon dioxide, also released as a gas. The platinum surface is available for
other nitric oxide molecules to land on, and the process continues. By using
the natural tendency of the molecules to bond to the platinum rather than
using heat to break up the molecules, you reduce the amount of energy
required for the chemical reaction to occur. Also, the fact that the catalyst can
be used over and over again means you don’t have to replace the material.
Traditional catalysts do their jobs very nicely, thank you very much, but in
life there is always room for improvement. Making the jump to nanocatalysts
would allow companies to produce complex chemicals — such as the gaso-
line produced from crude oil — using way less energy. Read on to see how
this might work.
Here’s where nanocatalysts come in
A catalyst with a large surface area can get more done because it interacts
with more molecules at the same time. Using nanoparticles or nanocrystals
to form catalysts provides larger surface area materials — so researchers are
looking to nanotechnology to improve the performance of existing catalysts.
212
Part III: “Smarter” Computers! Faster Internet! Cheaper Energy! 

In fact, many existing catalysts contain nano-size particles; not until recently,
however, did scientists have the tools or knowledge to study particles this
small. Now researchers are designing and developing nanoparticle catalysts
with a greater understanding of how these materials work on the nano scale.
At one end of the ready-for-nano-prime-time spectrum is NanoGram
Corporation, which has developed — and is already marketing — catalysts
composed of nanoparticles. Their catalysts can offer improved purity and
size uniformity compared to previously available catalysts. They claim this
will improve the effectiveness of the catalysts at a relatively low cost.
Scientists at Georgia Tech, however, are still focused on the research phase,
struggling to gain even more knowledge about how catalysts work. These
researchers have found that the ability of gold nanoparticles to act as a cata-
lyst depends upon the condition of the substrate the nanoparticles rest on.
They looked at how nanoparticles containing eight gold atoms on a magne-
sium oxide substrate interact with carbon monoxide. It turns out that if a
gold nanoparticle is attached to a substrate where there is a defect in the
magnesium oxide film, the nanoparticle transfers an electron to the carbon
monoxide. This does not occur if the gold nanocluster is attached to the sub-
strate at a location without a defect.
The researchers at Georgia Tech are looking farther into how the condition of
the substrate and the size of the nanoparticle affect the efficiency of the cata-
lyst; they hope it may lead to catalysts that allow reactions to occur at lower
temperatures. A successful result would require still less energy to produce a
reaction.
How Nanotechnology Can Help 
Our Environment
One of the big challenges in producing energy is to do it in a way that keeps
our planet from getting filthy. If nano-based solar cells succeed in producing
electricity, it will be at a lower cost than power plants that burn hydrocar-
bons such as oil, natural gas, or coal. If our world reduces the use of such
power plants as a result, we will greatly reduce associated air pollution.
If we can make the production and storage of hydrogen effective and cheap,
we may see widespread use of hydrogen fuel cells in cars, trucks, and ships,
which will also help our planet stay cleaner.
We hope that, in the long term, nanotechnologists will succeed in these areas,
but there are other, perhaps more incremental, ways that nanotechnology
can help our environment today.
213
Chapter 9: Getting Energy and a Cleaner Environment with Nanotech

Clearing the air with nanotechnology
One of our global problems is the increasing amount of carbon dioxide in 
the air. Instead of waiting around for cheap solar power to eliminate those
hydrocarbon-burning power plants at some distant point in the future, we
could try to clean up what’s coming out of those smokestacks right now.
Nanotechnology may be able to provide methods for doing this that are more
effective and less expensive than methods we use now.
Researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory have developed a nanocrystal
that might just do the trick. When carbon dioxide lands on a nanocrystal
composed of cadmium, selenium, and indium, the nanocrystal donates an
electron to the carbon dioxide. This extra electron allows the carbon dioxide
to react with other molecules in the smokestack — and become harmless. In
effect, the nanocrystal acts as a catalyst. If filters containing these nanocrys-
tals can be made cheaply enough, putting them in smokestacks can signifi-
cantly reduce emissions of carbon dioxide.
Another nasty emission that researchers are hoping nanocrystals can help us
deal with is mercury vapor. Mercury vapor is emitted by coal-fired power
plants. One mercury-containment method being investigated uses titanium
oxide nanocrystals under UV light — which turns the mercury vapor into
mercury oxide, a solid. However, placing a UV light source in the smokestack
poses a possible maintenance issue. Instead, we might use nanocrystals of
iron oxide (essentially high-tech rust), which require heat rather than UV
light to make the reaction work.
Then there are the diesel engines that emit nitrogen oxides, which you’ve
probably breathed if you’ve been stuck in traffic with big rigs and buses.
Biofriendly Corporation has been working on it; they’ve developed a nanocat-
alyst that, when added to diesel fuel, causes it to burn up more completely.
That means fewer nitrogen oxides are emitted. Biofriendly has received two
grants from the State of Texas to demonstate this nanocatalyst. (The second
grant is just to help them work through the Enviromental Protection Agency
verification process, which may prove harder than solving the original techni-
cal problem.)
Don’t think that “clean” manufacturing industries — those industries that
aren’t typically thought of as polluting the enviroment with waste materials
or toxic emissions, such as computer chip manufacturing — are worry-free. It
turns out that many of these industries use organic chemicals in their manu-
facturing processes. Organic chemical vapors can themselves be harmful.
Researchers at the Pacific Northwest National Lab, among others, are investi-
gating nanomaterials that we could use in filters to trap organic chemical
vapors escaping from such factories.

Keeping water crystal-clear 
with nanotechnology
Life needs water, but many of our lakes and streams have been contaminated
by wastes from industrial plants — add to that the pesticides used in our gar-
dens or by farms and you’ve got a serious problem. While current laws have
reduced the amount of contamination going into our waters, there are still
lakes and streams that are significantly contaminated. Researchers are look-
ing at ways that nanomaterials can help to clean up our water act.
Getting rid of TCE
One example is a joint venture: Rice University and Georgia Institute of
Technology are developing a better way to remove TCE (trichloroethylene)
from water. TCE has been found at a majority of sites on the EPA’s Superfund
list, and it’s pretty horrible stuff that can cause heart problems, nausea, 
vomiting, and eye irritation. TCE is primarily used to degrease components
during manufacturing operations but it is also used in products such as spot
removers for clothing (cleanliness comes at a price).
Palladium acts as a catalyst to convert TCE to ethane, which is not horrible.
But there’s a problem: Palladium is a rare metal, more expensive than gold.
Scientists are in search of the most efficient way to use palladium to neutral-
ize TCE. Given the large number of sites that must be decontaminated, it’s
important to find a way to use as little of this expensive metal as possible.
Both nanoparticles made of palladium and nanoparticles made of gold coated
with a layer of palladium atoms are possible options. Coating gold nanoparti-
cles with palladium atoms makes all the palladium atoms available to cat-
alyze the TCE molecules, and seems to be the most cost-effective use of
palladium.
One way to get nanoparticles into the contaminated groundwater to do their
work is to place a filter containing the nanoparticles in a pump that is used to
circulate contaminated water. As the water passes through the pump, the
TCE is broken down.
Making water fresh with solar energy
Distillation of salt water to make fresh water simply involves vaporizing the
water to separate it from salt. If nano-based solar cells can produce cheap
electricity, we might be able to use that electricity to turn salt water into
water that can be drunk and used for agriculture in deserts. This could be
useful in places like Los Angeles that now consume water gathered from
watersheds hundreds of miles away. Countries with hot, dry climates that
don’t have enough water to irrigate much of their land (Egypt, for example)
could also benefit. With enough cheap electricity, distillation could become
economically feasible.
215
Chapter 9: Getting Energy and a Cleaner Environment with Nanotech

Cleaner water for less money
One direction being looked at for cleaning water involves production of
nanoparticles that use less expensive materials than palladium, the current
industry standard. One idea: Inject iron nanoparticles into a contaminated
body of water, as illustrated in Figure 9-4. The particles would then spread
throughout the water, cleaning it in the process. This would be much faster
and cheaper than conventional methods that involve pumping the contami-
nated water out of the ground before treating it.
The iron nanoparticles are small enough that water could carry them into the
soil that the water is contaminating. When they react with oxygen in the
water, the iron nanoparticles turn into rust — a reaction that helps neutralize
contaminants it comes into contact with.
How, exactly, does rust neutralize contaminants? When iron rusts, it reacts
with both water (which contains an oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms)
and oxygen gas within the water. During this reaction, parts of molecules are
separated and then recombined to form another molecule. As a result, some
molecules that have either more or less electrons than normal (called ions)
are present in the water that surrounds the iron nanoparticle. These ions are
very reactive; when they encounter one of the contaminate molecules in the
water, they react with it, producing a new, hopefully less dangerous molecule.

Chapter 9: Getting Energy and a Cleaner Environment with Nanotech
Picking just the right iron nanoparticles
Rust? Useful? Who knew? Some scientists talk
as if iron nanoparticles were the low-cost cure-
all for groundwater contamination. The quality
and effectiveness of iron nanoparticles, how-
ever, may vary depending on the lab that makes
them. Different batches of iron nanoparticles,
made with different processes, may give you
different byproducts from their interaction with
certain contaminants.
For example, one study showed that, in combi-
nation with carbon tetrachloride (toxic stuff
used in many cleaning solutions), nanoparticles
coated with an iron oxide containing boron turn
carbon tetrachloride into chloroform — which
is poisonous. Nanoparticles coated with an iron
oxide containing sulfur turn carbon tetrachlo-
ride into harmless molecules.
While the idea of using iron nanoparticles may
have great potential as a relatively low-cost
way to decontaminate groundwater, it’s really
important to get the chemistry right: You have to
consider the process that created the nanopar-
ticle when you match it with a contaminant.

more amazing things. Some sober speculation suggests
that what we learn about nanotechnology today could
have a tremendous impact on health care (and therefore
our longevity) in the future.
This part looks into some nano-applications that can
improve our understanding of basic health — for instance,
diagnosing medical conditions and mapping our genes.
We also explore the role of nanomaterials in faster, better
drug delivery, and in doing some tiny (but highly practi-
cal) chores — attacking cancer and other evil cells, com-
bating heart disease, and knitting up broken bones.

n the fictional 23rd century, Dr. McCoy diagnoses patients in an instant by
waving a wand (okay, a “medical tricorder”) over a patient’s body. But
even back here in the 21st century, diagnosis is going to start looking a lot
like science-fiction mumbo jumbo. Imagine (for example) a patient’s blood
being analyzed in a lab the size of a computer chip, nano-size tracers racing
through the body to light up tumors like Christmas lights, and our DNA being
quickly mapped for us so we can get medical treatment customized down to
tiny details. Before long, many of our current medical practices will look like
the fumblings of the Dark Ages.
So let there be light! With nanotechnology allowing us to image our cells as
easily as if we were taking a picture — even control them as if we were model-
ing clay — we are set to enter a completely new age of medical technology.
Take a deep breath and join us as we make our way to the hospital to witness
how nanotechnology will change the way doctors diagnose our ailments.

Lab-on-a-Chip
Current laboratories cost a lot in terms of space, time, and resources.
Imagine if we could cut out sending samples to labs, push reactions faster,
automate experiments, and do it all with a minute amount of precious sam-
ples and materials. This is the concept behind the lab-on-a-chip — miniaturiz-
ing entire labs into the space of a microchip. The vision here is a tool that
could not only analyze our blood for viruses, but also detect chemical agents
that terrorists could have released into our air and water — all in real time,
allowing for a response in real time.
Dr. McCoy would certainly appreciate the space-saving nature of a lab-on-a-
chip, considering the fact that space is very limited on vessels traveling in . . .
space, that final frontier. The lab-on-a-chip could be used for experiments
done in orbit or to take care of astronauts on the shuttle where laboratory
equipment is too big and heavy to lug up. The applications are limitless, rang-
ing from the family doctor’s office to defense to space exploration.
Getting down to brass tacks for now, how does a lab-on-a-chip actually get its
work done? In a traditional medical lab — the kind you see on all those hospi-
tal or CSI shows on television — you’re going to see people wearing masks,
vials of fluids, and large-scale scientific instruments. In lieu of all this, we
shrink it down to the size of a computer chip but without all the electronic
connections. Instead, we use micro- and nano-size channels to move and mix
fluids — either liquids or gases — at the nano level. (Electronic circuits can
be combined with our lab-on-a-chip but are not necessary and depend upon
the application.)
Having trouble visualizing how this looks? Check out Figure 10-1, which
shows a rendering of Agilent Technologies’ lab-on-a-chip. Agilent is a spin-off
of Hewlett-Packard, those masters of microfluidics (say what?) who have
been producing finely blended inks for years for their ink-jet printers.
(Although Agilent isn’t the sole researcher or provider of lab-on-a-chip prod-
ucts, it’s the one that caught our attention.) Microfluidics is the study of the
behavior of fluids at volumes thousands of times smaller than a common
droplet.
In this chapter, we talk a lot about microfluidics because we’re convinced
that the informational tidbits you glean from our microfluidics’ discussion
will help when it comes to getting your mind around fluid flow at the 
nano-realm.
As you might imagine, we run into a few problems when working with fluids
at the micro and nano level. How do we fabricate channels through which we
can pump our fluids? How do we move and mix those fluids? How do we ana-
lyze samples? In this chapter, we answer these and other fascinating ques-
tions by looking more closely at how these channels get made, how fluids are
222
Part IV: Living Healthier Lives 

moved, and how samples are analyzed in your standard-issue lab-on-a-chip.
As an added bonus, we also discuss how nanowires and carbon nanotubes
can be used as a biosensor.
Fabrication through soft lithography
Creating a lab-on-a-chip follows some of the same lithography techniques
used to create the computer processor we discuss in Chapter 6. The objec-
tive is to produce nano-scale, leak-tight channels that allow for your fluids to
get from Point A to Point B. In the world of processors we describe in
Chapter 6, the goal is to build transistors layer-by-layer, one on top of the
other. In this brand-new world of labs-on-a-chip, we want a layer, a channel,
and another layer on top — kind of like a well-made sandwich.
In reaching our well-made-sandwich goal, we have quite a few fabrication
options — as well as a number of choices when it comes to materials. Some
fabrication methods involve etching (a method presently used for computer
processors); another method involves a thick photoresist that is used to
create tall, thin channels. (Photoresists use light-sensitive materials and
chemicals to etch metals while layering our transistors. For more on photore-
sists, see Chapter 6.) One fabrication method we are particularly fond of is
soft lithography, which uses polymers to create the nano-size channels of our
lab-on-a-chip. Using polymers here is great because it allows for rapid proto-
typing and flexibility — not only in design but physically as well (that’s what
makes it “soft”). The upcoming steps take a quick walk through this particu-
lar fabrication method (pictured in Figure 10-2):

1. A master is created on a silicon wafer, using traditional processor-
fabrication methods. To get a raised pattern that will act as a mold for
our polymer, we use a negative photoresist: We etch away the surround-
ing material till what’s left is a raised pattern that outlines the desired
channels on the silicon wafer.
2. We then cure a polymer onto our silicon wafer mold, which now has a
channel imprint with nanometer-scale features. Curing involves adding
heat to make the liquid polymer harden a bit — ultimately it feels and

looks like Jell-O. This is the soft-lithography process. The polymer of
choice is poly(dimethylsiloxane), PDMS for short.
3. We peel the cured layer of polymer off our master.
4. We oxidize the layer of polymer we just peeled off, sealing it to another
layer — usually PDMS, silicon, or glass. This oxidation process is carried
out by exposing the surface to plasma, a gas of charged particles, con-
verting the surface molecules to its oxide by combining it with oxygen. If
this oxidized surface (Si-OH) came in contact with another silicon-based
(Si) material (like another PDMS, silicon wafer, or glass), the process
forms an irreversible covalent O-Si-O bond.
5. We then add holes (an injection reservoir) to the polymer, allowing us to
inject liquids. Once the fluid is injected, it flows through the nanochan-
nels either mixing or separating molecules — all the work of a lab auto-
mated on a small scale.
In this particular application, the soft-lithography process produces a quick,
inexpensive, high-quality product. The PDMS polymer is flexible, optically
transparent (for applications where we want to use a laser to analyze our
sample), impermeable to water, non-toxic to cells, and inexpensive. On the
other hand, it is permeable to gases — which means we can’t use it in any
applications involving gas analysis. Also, its surface is hydrophobic (resists
water), which makes it both prone to trapping air bubbles as well as suscepti-
ble to binding to proteins and cells — we can’t do much analysis when our
cells are always sticking to the wall! But, as described above, we oxidize the
PDMS surface to bind it to another layer of PDMS or silicon. Fortunately, this
oxidizing also renders the surface hydrophilic (attracts water), solving our
problems of air bubbles and cell binding.
Since PDMS adheres well to itself, it can also be layered in more than just two
layers, allowing for the creation of complicated fluid interconnects.
Additionally, metal needles self-seal against PDMS, allowing syringes to be
used to supply fluids or act as pressure reservoirs. George Whitesides and
his team at Harvard have been working with PDMS and microfluidics for
years, producing some rather ingenious innovations, including the soft lithog-
raphy technique described above as well as pneumatic valves and micro
mixers.
Moving honey
When you work at the micro-scale level, the particles in the fluid you’re work-
ing with are going to be almost the same size as the device itself — a fact 
that changes the basic physics of fluids dramatically. Scientists obviously 
use some of these very same properties to move and mix fluids. Since our
surface-to-volume ratio at the micro-scale level is much greater than at the
macro scale, properties such as viscosity, surface tension, and electrical
225
Chapter 10: Diagnosing Personal Health Quickly, Easily, and Pain-Free

charges all play a great role. In the following sections we’ll discuss these
three properties in some detail — and, as an added bonus, we’ll take a look at
a unique way to move within this nano-realm.
Viscosity
Viscosity is the measure of resistance of a fluid — its “thickness,” if you will.
Fluids at the micro and nano level are highly viscous — they move more like
honey than water. As a result, a property known as laminar flow comes into
play, preventing fluids from mixing readily. With laminar flow, when two liq-
uids come together they stay parallel to each other as they go down the
channel, flowing smoothly and without turbulence.
Think of laminar flow and turbulence as polar opposites. If a real-life example
helps, think of what happens when water flows from your sink faucet. First
you have a steady stream of water that looks smooth, solid, and transparent,
but once the stream hits the sink, the water breaks up violently, turbulence is
created, and the water ceases to be transparent.
One nice thing about fluids at the nano level is that we rarely have to worry
about turbulence — which is a big help when you have to do some number
crunching. Laminar flow allows velocity calculations to be solved analytically
instead of treating it as the average behavior as we do when working at the
macro-scale level — the level where turbulence is once again involved.
Agilent Technologies and Caliper Technologies have collaborated to exploit
laminar flow to help speed drug discovery — technology that they’re using
today. Both came up with techniques where you could first mix cells together
with a fluorescing dye and then observe how the mixture interacts with the
different chemical compounds you’ve identified as the stuff that could poten-
tially become new drug candidates. The dye glows when the new drug reacts
with proteins on the cell’s surface — a sure sign that the drug can enter the
cell so that it can (potentially) cure the disease being targeted.
The trick here is getting your cells to line up nicely in the microchannels of
your lab-on-a-chip — think well-behaved children in the school lunch line
here — so that each individual cell could be observed separately. Now, it
turns out you can’t simply manufacture microchannels so small that only one
cell at a time makes its way through — if we tried to created a small nano-size
channel just big enough for a single cell to go through, all the cells would hit
it at once and quickly plug it up. But, if we introduced a buffer fluid that
pinched our cells against the wall (thank goodness for the laminar flow prin-
ciple), we could effectively have all the cells line up in single-file formation, as
shown in Figure 10-3. Such a buffer fluid forces the cells to pass through the
channel one by one, where a laser beam could do its magic. Those cells that
fluoresce and are detected by the laser indicate that the drug is effective.

Now, if you’ve ever tried to stir honey, you know it’s hard work. And if you’ve
ever tried to mix together two viscous fluids such as honey, you know it’s
very hard work. Now try doing it with tweezers . . . okay, not really with
tweezers but . . . well, sort of — keep reading. We’ve used laminar flow to
pinch off and direct fluid — which is a good thing. Laminar flow, however, is
also making it hard for us to mix stuff we actually want to mix — which is a
bad thing. Mixing at the nano scale is governed by diffusion — over a long
enough distance, the two fluids will diffuse into each other. As shown in
Figure 10-4, however, it can take some time for diffusion to do its work. Here
the two different colored dyes have run some distance side by side, and still
haven’t fully mixed.

Fluorescence
If you’ve ever gone to a haunted house for
Halloween, you probably noticed a lot of glow-
ing objects around you that may have looked
just a tad ghostly. Maybe even that white shirt
you had on had an eerie purple glow. Now, the
glowing objects were surely made of ectoplas-
mic goo, like that stuff in Ghostbusters, but the
eerie white shirt was a result of the black lights
on the track lighting hitting phosphors on your
shirt — remnants of your tried-and-true laundry
detergent — causing the shirt to fluoresce.
(Okay, okay, we were kidding about the ecto-
plasmic goo. They were really extraterrestrial
objects.)
Fluorescence 
is 
a 
property 
of 
some 
molecules — like phosphors, for example —
that are able to absorb one wavelength of light
and then emit light at a higher wavelength. The
energy associated with our friend the photon
determines how high up the wavelength spec-
trum we’re talking about here, and, hence, 
the color — if in the visible spectrum. This
energy from photons is transferred to electrons,
causing them to become “excited” — not just
“happy to see you,” but also discharging excess
energy just like when kids eat too much candy
at Halloween.
Electrons in an excited state are unstable and
tend to lose this excess energy. It turns out that,
in fluorescent molecules, electrons lose this
energy in two stages — a small amount at first
(given off as heat) followed by a large amount
which results in an emission of a photon of light.
The energy of this emitted photon is lower than
the absorbed photon, resulting in a difference in
the color of light that is emitted.
The figure below shows a blue light with high
energy exciting an electron sending it up to its
“excited state.” This electron is unstable and
gives off small amounts of energy in the form of
heat. Eventually, this electron gives up and goes
completely back down to the ground state, its
stable state, emitting a photon in the process.
This emitted photon is lower in energy but
higher in wavelength, giving off a green color.

One way to get your two streams to mix is to narrow the streams as much as
possible. That way, we only have to diffuse over the width of one stream. We
do this by hydrodynamic focusing — we use laminar flow to pinch and create
as narrow a stream as possible, as shown on the left in Figure 10-5. Another
way to mix is to introduce turbulence — not especially easy, to be honest,
but it can be done at this level. By adding irregular ridges on the bottom of
our flow channel, as shown on the right in Figure 10-5, we can cause chaotic
motion to occur in the cross section, leading to rapid mixing.
Surface tension
Okay, now that we have viscosity under our belts, we’re stuck with just two
more properties of fluids to work through. Number Two on our list is surface
tension.
You might say to yourself, “surface tension, schmurface tension, what’s the
big deal?” But at the nano level, fluids and how they interact with various sur-
faces can become crucial. Imagine, for a moment, a water droplet on a waxed
car. This water droplet has a bulk inside with a surface shell outside — kind
of like an itty-bitty water balloon. This bulk inside has water molecules inter-
acting just with each other, whereas the surface molecules interact with both
each other and with air. The surface molecules have to expend more energy
because they don’t experience the same stabilizing hydrogen-bond interac-
tions as the water molecules in the bulk. The larger the surface area, the
greater the energy cost. This excess energy required to expand the surface by
a unit area is what we call surface tension. Surface tension is the pull of a
liquid into its most compact form to minimize the amount of energy used,
keeping the surface area to a minimum — which is, come to think of it, pre-
cisely that force that pulls water into a droplet on a waxed or oily surface.
Since we’re dealing with small amounts of fluids, the surface forces over-
whelm the bulk forces — and the little droplets keep their cute chubby
shapes.
229
Chapter 10: Diagnosing Personal Health Quickly, Easily, and Pain-Free
Going back to our example of white shirts glow-
ing eerily in Halloween haunted houses, black
light bulbs generate ultraviolet light around
350nm — a short wavelength with high energy.
In turn, the phosphors generate visible light
between 400nm and 700nm — longer wave-
lengths with lower energy. We can’t see the
ultraviolet light emitted from the black lights but
we can see the visible light from the fluores-
cence of the phosphors.
Fluorescence has three major advantages
when it comes to medical applications: high
sensitivity, high speed, and safety. The fluores-
cence signal is proportional to the concentra-
tion of the substance being investigated, giving
it high sensitivity. A change in concentration
can be detected in picoseconds, giving it high
speed. Fluorescence is also noninvasive —
safely monitoring samples, not harming 
living tissue, and not producing hazardous
byproducts.

So, how can we get such surface forces to work for us? Funny you should ask.
There are, in fact, many ways to control fluids by using surface interaction,
including varying the temperature of the system and the electrochemistry of
the surface molecules. One interesting way to control the surface area is with
light — we can actually move a droplet with different wavelengths of a laser
light. Scientists at the Tokyo Institute of Technology, for example, have used a
UV laser to change the chemical structure of a droplet’s surface — allowing

them to change its surface energy and spread out the droplet; then they used
a blue laser to bring the droplet tighter together. By varying the intensity 
at one end of the droplet, we can get the droplet to move, as shown in 
Figure 10-6. Here, the droplet is spread out with UV light while a blue light is
introduced gradually — until (when the blue is at maximum) the droplet is
restored to its original shape — at a different location. This process can also
move a droplet within a tube, not just on a flat surface.
An interesting spin-off of using light to affect fluids involves optical tweezers.
With optical tweezers, we can use a strongly focused laser beam to grasp and
move small, translucent particles. Without going into too much detail, when a
particle we want to grab comes in contact with our laser, there’s a “restoring
force” that pulls the object back to the center of the laser’s beam. A lot of this
has to do with the material of the particle and the type of laser wavelength
used . . . not to mention, a lot of explanation of optics. The nice thing about
using a laser is that we don’t destroy or change our particle — great when
dealing with something that’s alive. We’ll stop there and hope you’re con-
vinced that this works.

David Grier and his group at the University of Chicago have taken optical
tweezers a step further with his “holographic optical tweezers.” In Grier’s
work, a laser is split into sub-beams that can independently manipulate many
tiny particles. Not only can these particles be moved and mixed but also set
spinning. Individual cells can even be picked up and placed in a tube.
Additionally, by changing the laser wavelength, the folks at Chicago can sort
objects ranging from 10 nanometers (about virus size) to 100 microns. The
fun doesn’t stop there — holographic optical tweezers are incredibly flexible,
able to sort cells by size, surface charge, magnetism, and shape — just by
changing the laser’s power, wavelength, or orientation.
Arryx, Inc., holds the exclusive license to holographic optical tweezers — a
commercial product based on Grier’s innovations. Using their first product,
BioRyx 2000, researchers can manipulate hundreds of microscopic objects
independently and simultaneously, in all three dimensions. The next Arryx
product is set to be MatRyx, a high-throughput cell sorter used by the cattle
industry to sort male and female reproductive cells for breeding — now that’s
a unique application.
Electrical charges
Two properties of fluids down and one to go. Get ready for a charge.
Another method for moving particles through our microchannels is 
electrokinetics — moving substances by applying an electrical charge 
(specifically, a voltage difference) across the microchannels, as shown in
Figure 10-7. Okay, trying to move fluids at the macro scale by applying a volt-
age and expecting an impact would be ridiculous, but when you get to sizes
smaller than 10 microns, it works — on particles.
Intrigued yet? There’s more. Keep in mind that we have the following two
types of electrokinetics:
 Electrophoresis consists of moving particles through our nanochannel
by placing an external voltage difference across the entire channel —
same as shown in Figure 10-7. This voltage difference moves charged
particles through the channel. It turns out that we can separate these
particles based upon charge and size — the big particles move slower
than the small particles. This process is used today for DNA fingerprint-
ing and general fluid composition analysis.
 Electro-osmosis is similar to electrophoresis in respect to using a volt-
age difference to move our fluid through a nanochannel. However, we
also charge the sides of the channel wall. Charged particles in the liquid
interact and slip past the charges on the channel walls. This allows us to
push the fluid column down the channel with all the particles at the
same speed. This looks like a slippery, square plug being pushed down
the channel and is actually called “plug flow.”

Thinking differently
Okay, we’ve gotten all of our fluid properties out of the way, but we can’t put
away the thinking caps quite yet. If we really want to make the whole
microfluidics/lab-on-a-chip/microchannels thing work, we have to find a way
to keep our samples from going down the wrong way (you know, what hap-
pens when you try to drink that can of soda while your friend tells you a
great joke). PDMS, that polymer of choice for microfluidics, can be used to
create a mechanical valve designed to accomplish just that task.
Figure 10-8 gives you a bird’s-eye view of one way this can be done. We sand-
wich a thin layer of our PDMS between two other layers of PDMS, using a
process called multilayer soft lithography (MSL). (For more on soft lithogra-
phy, see the “Fabrication through soft lithography” section, earlier in the
chapter.) To glue the layers together, we oxidize the PDMS layers and press
them together — but we don’t completely expose the middle layer to the oxi-
dation process. That means the “unglued” layer is free to move, allowing
fluids to go through it but not come back through.
MSL was developed by Stanford biophysicist Stephen Quake — the guy who
co-founded Fluidigm Corp. This layering process allows Fluidigm the flexibil-
ity necessary to design not only valves but also unique pumps and complex
microchannels — giving them a competitive edge in this emerging market.
Keeping things moving
Now that we have some idea as to how we move honey, how do we move in
honey? Since we have no turbulence — the stuff that allows for gliding — the
conventional notion of swimming is thrown out the window. Without turbu-
lence, making a single motion and exactly reversing it will put you right back
where you started. Therefore, the trick is to design something that is not
identical in the reverse direction — something cyclical like the flexible oar or
corkscrew you see in Figure 10-9. (These look a lot like flagella, the whiplike
organelles that unicellular organisms such as bacteria use to propel them-
selves about.)

These biomotors are made of complex “motor proteins” which use ATP
(adenosine triphosphate) as an energy source. Carlo Montemagno and his
group at Cornell University have incorporated molecular motors into engi-
neered devices. They’ve used a biomolecular motor that runs on ATP, and
attached a base to the bottom and a nickel nanowire to the top to act as a
propeller, as shown in Figure 10-10. Amazingly enough, these work as 
advertised.

Biosensing with nanowires
So, now we have our lab-on-a-chip and know how to move fluids through
them. Previously, we described using fluorescence to illuminate specific cells
to be read by our laser. (See the appropriately named “Fluorescence” sidebar,
earlier in the chapter.) We think we can do better than this and cut out the
fluorescence step. Imagine if you will that we can incorporate nanosensors
directly into the lab-on-a-chip — as the fluid went over the sensors, the
sensor detected the particles, replacing the need for the fluorescent dye and
laser. This sensor will have to react to biological molecules (proteins) — we’ll
call this a biosensor (not very original).
This sensor will also have to be small — from our tool chest of materials
described in Chapter 3, we have nanowires (they’re small). So, let’s make a
biosensor out of nanowires and incorporate them into our lab-on-a-chip
(sounds like fun).
Nanowires, because of their small size, make very sensitive devices. We’re
going to use a nanowire as a component of our tiny biosensor. This nanowire
(any nanowire will do) will be turned into a transistor, in much the same way
as carbon nanotubes were in Chapter 6: The researchers bring each end of
the nanowire into contact with other metal wires so they may pass current
through the nanowire. Now, if the nanowire was a traditional transistor, an
electrode would be placed close to it, altering its conductance so it could be
turned on or off. In the case of our biosensor “transistor,” however, the mol-
ecules that we’re trying to detect are what change the conductance — they
236

Giving cells the squeeze test
Getting lab specimens to line up nicely and
move along (no talking, please!) through the
microchannels of our lab-on-a-chip is a great
accomplishment, but it’s only half the battle. We
still need to come up with an effective way to
give specimens the once over — to analyze
them, in other words. In our discussion of lami-
nar flow (back in the “Moving honey” section
earlier in the chapter), we highlight one way of
carrying out such an analysis — using a laser
to count cells that have fluorescent tracers
attached to them. Another approach, which
likewise uses a laser to analyze a cell, is called
an optical stretcher. After the cells are lined up,
one-by-one, they are squeezed individually with
a laser to test their elasticity. It turns out that
cancer cells are softer than healthy ones —
and this optical stretcher can detect a clear dif-
ference between the two more quickly than cur-
rent elasticizing methods. Optical stretching can
sample several hundred cells per hour, as com-
pared to ten cells a day — a huge advantage —
thanks to nanotechnolgy.

actually cause the transistor to switch, so there’s no need for a switching
electrode. Keep in mind that our biosensor “transistor” isn’t a transistor in
the computer sense, but functions in a similar way.
How do we pull this little trick off? We coat the nanowire with antibodies that
stick only to the proteins that we’re trying to measure — not to other mol-
ecules. When these proteins bind to the antibodies, they interact with the 
electrons traveling in the nanowire’s surface layer — which alters its conduc-
tivity. If the nanowire is small enough, the surface layer is pretty much the
entire wire — and with very little inside bulk, a large portion of the atoms
making up the wire are on the surface. This allows the nanowire to be very
sensitive; a minute amount of change to the surface would significantly
change the conductivity. If the nanowire is small enough, it may even be able
to detect individual molecules.
Charles Lieber’s group at Harvard demonstrated that nanosensors like these
can detect a single virus particle. Given this sensitivity, we could conceivably
use such biosensors to detect a wide range of diseases by their early warning
signs — and treating the disease sooner means a greater chance of survival.
At the top in Figure 10-11, you can see a piece of nanowire between the metal
leads, with Y-shaped antibodies attached to the surface. The molecules, pro-
teins, or other biological species bind to the antibodies, which changes the
conductance of the wire. These nanowires can be placed in arrays — with
each wire coated with a different antibody (representing a different detector),
as shown at the bottom in Figure 10-11.

Chapter 10: Diagnosing Personal Health Quickly, Easily, and Pain-Free
Carbon nanotubes: Mr. Sensitive?
Carbon nanotubes have established themselves
as chemical sensors (as we discuss in Chap-
ter 8), but they are also a hot prospect for use
as biosensors. Imagine replacing the nanowire
we’ve been describing here with carbon 
nanotubes between the two metal contacts:
Antibodies are attached to the nanotubes and
the conductance is measured — a quick way to
detect specific molecules in the environment.
And as if that weren’t enough, a couple of other
architectures for biosensors take advantage of
carbon nanotubes:
 An individual nanotube can be attached to
the end of a microtip providing nanometer
resolution able to probe single molecules of
DNA or proteins. This allows scientists to
take electrical, electrochemical, and elec-
trophysiology measurements of individual
cells.
 Nanotubes can be randomly distributed so
they form a flat sheet. This thin film is then
placed between two electrodes, forming
our biosensor. This approach circumvents
the high cost of making our single nanotube
biosensor — those things are small and we
haven’t found anyone with the patience to
lay them out one at a time . . . yet.

James Heath has been working on this technology and combining it with the
lab-on-a-chip idea. Dr. Heath has been studying nanowires for use as biosen-
sors, collaborating with Stanford’s Stephen Quake, a co-founder of Fluidigm
Corp. (Quake’s work on creating lab-on-a-chips using multilayer soft lithogra-
phy got an honorable mention from us earlier in the chapter.) In this case,
fluids are shuttled down microchannels in single file, and positioned over
these nanosensor arrays where they can be studied one at a time — another
way to analyze our sample.

Super X-Ray Vision
Any lab-on-a-chip we could come up with takes small biological samples and
analyzes them quickly so that what ails us can be diagnosed in a heartbeat,
allowing for faster treatment. As it stands, all this lab-on-a-chip analysis takes
place outside the body — a good start, but not the radical medical break-
through that’s going to get us all on the cover of People magazine. What we
really want is to be able to tell whether our drugs are working within the
body — and that means imaging biological processes nondestructively in the
body, in real time. Such a medical application would allow us to monitor dis-
ease processes and measure how well the therapy is working. We’d even be
able to study how diseases disrupt normal molecular and cellular signals and
pathways and how individual molecules work inside cells.
This molecular imaging — the official term for snooping in on the private lives
of molecules — has taken root at Massachusetts General Hospital’s Center for
Molecular Imaging Research. Using fluorescent tags, radiologist Umar
Mahmood traces the paths of destructive enzymes secreted by a tumor. His
computer screen helps him track, and eventually determine, the underlying
causes of this disease. Mahmood has worked with chemists to develop
“smart probes,” allowing the tag to give an indication when it meets its target.
In this case, untreated tumors fluoresce brighter than treated tumors in real
time. This may not seem like a big deal, but current methods involve waiting
a few months to see whether the tumor physically shrinks, indicating suc-
cess. Studies along these lines will eventually lead to detecting cancer indica-
tors — molecular aberrations — that precede physical symptoms by months
or even years. This procedure could even replace the biopsy (in which a sur-
geon cuts out a piece of tissue to subject to tests — not pleasant).
Molecular imaging comes in a variety of forms. One involves dendrimers,
polymer-based treelike structures that are as little as 3nm across. Researchers
at the University of Michigan Center for Biologic Nanotechnology are using
dendrimers to deposit a type of DNA into the cell making it glow. At Ben-Gurion
University in Israel, Raz Jelinek affixes color-changing polymers to human
cells. These polymer coatings are arranged in 30–150nm patches, which fluo-
resce if something perturbs the cells’ membranes. This little fluorescing
“alarm bell” lets drug developers determine if drugs are reaching their targets
and lets medical researchers see if viruses are mounting attacks.

Tracers in fullerenes
Buckyballs (fullerenes or C60, described in Chapter 3) may be used as con-
trast agents for medical imaging. Contrast agents improve the resolution of
the image by increasing the brightness where the agent resides. Fullerenes —
those cute soccer-ball-shaped molecules — act as “cages” for contrast
agents, lowering any residual toxic side effects. This results in a metallo-
fullerene — a metal consisting of only a few atoms encaged within a fullerene
(a metallofullerene can be seen on the cover of this book). It’s important to
note that fullerenes are small enough to penetrate the blood-brain barrier —
the membrane that protects the central nervous system from toxins and
infection that may be found in the rest of the body.
In magnetic-resonance imaging (MRI) — the current high-tech benchmark 
in medical imaging — gadolinium (a metal) serves as a contrast agent.
Gadolinium has very few harmful side effects and low metal toxicity, but the
industry is always looking for ways to prevent metals from leaving the deliv-
ery vehicle and causing further harm to the body. Research involving gadolin-
ium housed in a fullerene (C82) suggests that the metallofullerene provides a
better contrast agent than gadolinium alone. It’s a win-win-win result: better
contrast, lower toxicity, and faster scans.
The tiny fullerene cages also have a use in nuclear medicine. They offer an
alternative to using radioactive metals alone as contrast agents (not ideal
because they’re absorbed by the body, where they aggregate in tissues and
remain there for the life of the patient). Fullerene cages can be used to trap
these radioactive metals — the radioactive metal stays in its cage-molecule,
where it can be normally filtered and expunged from the body.
Modifying the fullerene cage itself may provide some benefits. Lon Wilson’s
group at Rice University (for example) has modified the gadolinium-based
metallofullerene (C60) so the metallofullerenes aggregate — which enhances
their image properties. Companies like C Sixty modify the cage to make the
molecule soluble and accessible to cells, providing further uses (such as an
antioxidant which inhibits oxidation and helps limit cellular damage caused
by free radicals, highly reactive molecules).
Quantum dots
We describe quantum dots, semiconducting nanocrystals roughly 5nm in
size, in Chapter 8, where we show how they fit into the electrical world. They
also have applications in the biological world as fluorescent tags. Quantum
dots are nanometer-scale nanocrystals composed of a few hundred to a few
thousand semiconductor atoms made out of bio-inert materials — meaning
240
Part IV: Living Healthier Lives 

they are nonintrusive and nontoxic to the body. Additionally, unlike fluores-
cent dyes (which tend to decompose and lose their ability to fluoresce),
quantum dots maintain their integrity withstanding more cycles of excitation
and light emission before they start to fade. Changing their size or composi-
tion allows scientists to cater their optical properties — which means they
can fluoresce in a multitude of colors. This effect is called quantum confine-
ment (hence the name quantum dots) — they have quantized, discrete energy
levels that are directly related to their size.
Interestingly enough, quantum dots can even be tuned to fluoresce in differ-
ent colors with the same wavelength of light. In other words, we can choose
quantum dot sizes where the frequency of light required to make one group
of dots fluoresce is an even multiple of the frequency required to make
another group of dots fluoresce; both dots then fluoresce with the same
wavelength of light. This allows for multiple tags to be tracked while using a
single light source.
A. Paul Alivisatos and his company (Quantum Dot Corporation) have used
these concepts in their Qdot product — a quantum dot surrounded by an
inorganic shell that amplifies its optical properties while protecting the dot
from its environment. The Qdot can have a variety of attachments to its shell,
allowing it to attach to specific cell walls — or even penetrate a cell and light
it up from the inside. In the summer of 2003, Quantum Dot Corporation joined
forces with Matsushita Electronic Industrial Co. (Panasonic) and Sumitomo
Corporation Biosciences to develop advanced optical and image-processing
technologies that utilize the Qdot. Products under this agreement are expected
to generate revenue of more than $100 million per year for Quantum Dot
Corporation by 2007. (Tiny product, big bucks.)
An example of quantum dots in action involves targeting and imaging cancer
cells. Researchers at Emory University, Georgia Tech, and Cambridge
Research and Instrumentation have used quantum dots to identify tumors in
mice. These quantum dots were made of cadmium selenide-zinc sulphide,
each 5nm in diameter. They were coated with polymers to prevent both the
body from attacking the quantum dot and to keep the dots themselves from
leaking toxic cadmium and selenium ions. (Eek! Toxic! Read on. . . .) Finally,
they attached antibodies to the outer shell that was first targeted and then
attached themselves to a prostate tumor cell surface. The scientists injected
the quantum dots into the circulatory system and the dots accumulated at
the tumor, which could then be detected by fluorescence imaging. As an
added benefit, these quantum dots have a large surface area allowing for a
dual role of both diagnostics and therapy — the surface is big enough to
attach both diagnostic and therapeutic antibodies to the surface.
I know what you’re thinking — “Rich, what’s with all this about toxicity 
and eek-ing? We can’t have our imaging material causing more problems.”
And, you’re right. The scientists have also thought of this and have done
241
Chapter 10: Diagnosing Personal Health Quickly, Easily, and Pain-Free

experiments mirroring the body’s environment to make sure quantum dots
and their coatings are stable over a broad range of pH and salt conditions —
even hydrochloric acid. And they passed with (ahem) flying colors.
Carbon nanotubes also have this fluorescence quality. R. Bruce Weisman and
his group at Rice University have determined that semiconducting carbon
nanotubes fluoresce in the near-infrared spectrum and can be fine-tuned to
different wavelengths by varying the nanotube diameters. The near-infrared
spectrum is particularly important for biomedical applications — but nothing
in the human body fluoresces in this region of the spectrum; in effect, human
tissue is fairly transparent. It’s especially handy that nanotubes also maintain
their fluorescent properties inside living cells, with no adverse effects to the
cell. (For more on carbon nanotubes, see Chapter 4.)
Down the road, such carbon nanotube technology may be used along the
same lines as the quantum dots — you could end up wrapping the tubes with
a specific protein, allowing them to target cells (such as tumors). Along these
lines, a proposal by Michael Strano and his team at the University of Illinois-
Urbana/Champaign (involving a glucose-detection optical sensor) looks espe-
cially promising. Here, nanotubes are wrapped in a glucose oxidase and
placed inside a small, porous capillary (200 microns across by 1cm in length).
The capillary pores are only big enough for glucose to penetrate; once
through, the glucose promptly reacts with the oxidase solution — changing
the fluorescence properties of the nanotubes. This capillary is subsequently
inserted just underneath the skin, but within range of being able to detect the
near-infrared flouresence. Imagine a patient with diabetes wearing a watch
that periodically checks the fluorescence/glucose and sounds an alert if
levels are too low or too high — all without needles.
Unlike quantum dots, nanotubes don’t contain heavy metals, so they don’t
raise any toxicity issues. Additionally, nanotubes can be fine-tuned to very
narrow wavelengths, providing fluorescence in a greater number of wave-
lengths, giving us greater flexibility (in other words, more colors to our
palette). Such properties may give nanotubes the advantage among products
marketed as laboratory imaging markers — we’ll have to see whether they
can squeak by to take the lead from quantum dots.
Mapping Our Genes
Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is the nucleic acid carrying the genetic blueprint
of all forms of cellular life. You may remember from high-school biology class
that DNA has four building blocks (called bases) abbreviated A, T, G, and C.
Each of these bases only pairs up with its complement — A only matches
with T and G only matches with C — to form the famed double helix, as
shown in Figure 10-12.
242
Part IV: Living Healthier Lives 

One nice thing about DNA involves a property known as hybridization — DNA
will bind only to a complementary strand, and to nothing else. “And why is
that handy?” you ask. Well, imagine you want to detect a structure that con-
tains the following strand: ACTGTA. You can do so by creating the comple-
mentary strand (TGACAT) and, when they hybridize — creating a
double-strand — they’ll be bigger and you can measure this with sophisti-
cated instruments.

Don’t get me wrong — this isn’t easy and is usually done with many double-
strands being formed and detected. (Nanotech will help bring down this
sample size — read on.) For our example of six bases — made up of the four
different possible bases — we have 46 (4,096) possible combinations. Then
comes the voice from the back of the room: “Hey, Rich! Why is that impor-
tant?” Well, if we know the DNA sequence of a unique short section (say 15
bases) of a disease, we can sense this section of the strand by using the com-
plementary strand. What we get is a one-in-one-billion (415) chance of error
per strand tested — very accurate, in other words.
It’s nice to know that DNA carries the genetic blueprint of all life, but what
can you actually do with it? It’s not as if you can use such a blueprint to build
a summer home, right? Actually, there are a few reasons for wanting to know
the genetic blueprint of an individual. For openers, you can determine a sub-
ject’s likelihood for developing certain diseases — and determine which
drugs will be most effective at treating those diseases. This second reason is
called pharmacogenetics, which is projected to be a $30 billion industry by
2013, treating cancer, immune disorders, HIV/AIDS, and neuropsychiatric dis-
orders. Neuropsychiatric disorders are set to benefit greatly, particularly
because they are difficult to diagnose and treat.
Given the stakes — and money — involved, it’s clear that we need to find
easy, foolproof ways to map our DNA. Current methods use fluorescent dye
markers, but nano-approaches point us in new directions. One new way to
map our genes involves using a lab-on-a-chip, where some of those strange
fluid properties of microfluidics (which we discuss earlier in this chapter)
could be used to separate proteins and DNA. Additionally, a drop of blood
can be instantly checked against known viral or bacterial DNA and water sup-
plies could be checked for toxic microorganisms.
Nanogen and Orchid Biosciences are two lab-on-a-chip companies exploring
DNA detection.
Another way to map our DNA is to utilize some of the same optical concepts
we discuss in the “Quantum dots” section, earlier in this chapter. DNA is
attached to gold or silver nanodots (13nm wide) that are suspended in a
liquid. Each gold particle has the same base pair — but when a linker (such
as Anthrax DNA) is introduced, the gold particles form larger clusters, which
changes their optical properties, as shown in Figure 10-13. (Here particle size
dictates the wavelength of light, hence color.) Imagine that without the linker,
the liquid looks purple; with the linker, however, the liquid looks red — pro-
viding a quick macroscopic analysis. Because of this color change, these are
called colorimetric sensors.

Microarray
The DNA microarray is a veritable lawn of single-strand DNA molecules that
stand on a postage-stamp-size chip. Microarrays are used for many different
purposes:
 to identify DNA sequences and subtle differences in gene composition
 to determine gene response to potential new drugs
 to study evolutionary history of genes to determine growth processes
If all that sounds a bit off the beaten path, guess again. The DNA microarray
market — including protein and cellular microarrays — is slated to reach $1.6
billion in 2008. The microarray chip depicted in Figure 10-14 shows a checker-
board array, where each section contains thousands (even millions) of copies
of the same DNA strand.

When a sample is dropped onto the microarray, as shown on the left in Fig-
ure 10-15, every section of the array performs the reaction at the same 
time — in parallel. The sample contains fluorescent tags that indicate
whether the strands match the specific, single strand of DNA on which the
array is based. The microarray chip is then read into a computer, which
quantifies gene activity on a color-coded readout, as shown on the right in
Figure 10-15. Further computer analysis helps determine whether the sample
is a good drug candidate or not.

A major use of these microarrays (besides customizing medicine to fit patient
needs and determining how vulnerable a patient is to disease) is in building a
detailed picture of the effect of a drug or disease, a technique called expres-
sion profiling. It’s not enough to just know if a genetic blueprint is present; it’s
equally important to determine the amount of proteins that are produced by
that blueprint. By knowing various levels of proteins, scientists can gain
detailed “snapshots” of how a cell’s functions have been altered by a drug or
disease. This snapshot reflects the molecular state of the sample under spe-
cific conditions — and that knowledge can help determine treatment.
All of this investigation and intervention at the nano level will help us in our
ultimate goal: determining how genes actually work. We know that genes
work together or in series to induce a cellular response. We also know that
some of these genes are associated with each other — knowing precisely how
one gene operates sheds light on how associated genes may act in a similar
situation. Additionally, knowing the associated gene may lead us to discover
proteins not previously known to play a role in diseases.
Working on the DNA chain gang
In 2003, Jene Golovchenko and his team at Harvard developed a unique
method for eventually reading DNA sequences. First they use an ion beam to
poke a 3nm hole into a 10nm-thick silicon nitride membrane. Then they
thread the double-stranded DNA through the nanopore, as shown in Fig-
ure 10-16, and measure the ionic current. The presence or absence of current
blockades — that is, dramatic drops in the current that suggest an obstacle —
describe individual molecular features like the sequencing of our DNA.

Actually, studying molecules by using electrical signals across nano-scale
pores is not new. Biopores — membranes utilizing a lipid bilayer (similar to a
cell wall) in which we can control and insert nanopores — have been around
since at least 1992. Biopores, however, do have some limitations: The pore
size is fixed — and if the pores are destroyed at extreme temperatures, volt-
ages, or pH conditions, there go your results.
By using the more stable solid-state silicon nitride membrane instead of a
lipid bilayer, Golovchenko observed new phenomena — such as folding
(a folded molecule’s bend went through the hole first) and pairing (two con-
nected molecules went through the hole at once). Although these phenom-
ena don’t sound spectacular, they give scientists a way into playing with
molecules outside the natural states they’re found in. In other words, if we
bend a molecule in a way it doesn’t normally bend, we may observe new 
and unique properties for that molecule. The ultimate goal for us (and
Golovchenko) is to rapidly sequence DNA, providing a better understanding
of our genes, to prevent disease and usher in a medicine catering to individ-
ual needs.

“Man is the center of the universe. We stand in the middle of infinity

from Fantastic Voyage (1966)
I
n the 1966 film Fantastic Voyage, audiences were introduced to their own
bodies from the inside. A group of doctors got into a submarine-like ship
and were shrunk down to the size of a cell. They were then injected into a
human body to search and destroy a blood clot. Audiences got a fairly realis-
tic look at some of the inner workings of the human body. (If you don’t know
what we’re talking about, you may remember Dennis Quaid, Martin Short,
and Meg Ryan in the 1987 movie Innerspace — same concept.)
It’s a recurrent theme in science fiction: Human beings want to live long,
healthy, pain-free lives — and we will continue to create (and invest in) ways
to do so. Nanotechnology is an emerging reality that can help us along that
path. It won’t enable humans to shrink, but it can, however, help us modify
and create particles that circulate through the body with as much control as
if we were in there calling the shots. This chapter explores some unique
approaches to delivering drugs and killing cancer that nanotechnology makes
possible. We start with some of the problems pharmaceutical companies
have with drug development — and discuss a “nano-way” to deliver drugs
that addresses this problem. We then provide a recipe for cooking cancer
(that is, eliminating it) and tell you about some new concepts of artificial
blood and bones.

Understanding How Pharmaceutical
Companies Develop Drugs
Bioavailability refers to how well a treatment can target specific cells. For the
last hundred years or so, pharmaceutical products have suffered from poor
bioavailability — their main approach is to flood the body with the drugs that
are needed. One aspirin cures a headache but one hundred aspirins kill the
patient (permanently “curing” the headache). This is especially not good for
cancer and chemotherapy; increasing the amount of toxic drugs eventually
kills the patient.
As with any business, companies doing drug development have to choose
between risk and reward. The amount of risk in drug development is incredi-
bly high — in terms of both time and money. The starting point is to deter-
mine which molecules of what compounds will be most effective at curing a
disease. Different models of how the disease works are used — and these
days computer programs speed up the process — but taking a new drug from
research to development to administration still takes a long time. Even today,
the average time between the patent application and the marketing of a new
medicine is 12 years. And a patent expires after only 20 years. To top it off,
some research projects are scrapped as late as advanced-stage clinical trials
(roughly nine years after kickoff!).
According to Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, only
five candidate medicines are sent to clinical trials for every 5,000 drugs
tested in the preclinical phase (that is, before they’re approved for clinical
tests). And of those five, only one is finally approved for release to the mar-
ketplace. Figure 11-1 shows the timeline of drug development from inception
to market to patent expiration.
With high risk comes high cost — the price tag for research and development
(for example) more than doubled worldwide between 1990 and 2000. In 2001
alone, a total of $43.63 billion was spent — a billion dollars here, a billion dol-
lars there — pretty soon, you’re talking about real money. Every new drug
costs an average of $802 million to bring to market (which includes the cost
developing those that didn’t make it to market). The high rate of failure, the
cost of clinical trials, and the time required for product approval all con-
tribute to the growing cost of research. Result: Even though we’re spending
more money, we’re producing fewer new medicines.
Only 32 new drugs were introduced in 2000 — a pretty low figure — and the
number of new drugs developed yearly is decreasing while the cost of devel-
oping a new drug is increasing. This is not a good tradeoff, but there may be
some light at the end of this particular tunnel: Rapid advances in biotechno-
logical applications. Biotechnology patent applications increased from 590 in
1996 to 1,615 in 2000, and this trend can help move us in the direction of
faster, less-costly drug development. The sequencing of the human genome,
250
Part IV: Living Healthier Lives 

for example, is one new body of knowledge that can help us determine which
medicines work by singling out the particular genes that contribute to illness.
Nanotechnology, in conjunction with biotechnology, will aid in more effective
medicines while lowering the costs.
Delivering a New Drug 
the Nanotech Way
Our ultimate goal is to find a way to get drugs to a specific site in the body —
that is, to increase bioavailability. Here are the steps involved:
1. Develop a delivery mechanism that packages the drug.
2. Insert the drug into the bloodstream.
3. Release the drug at the specific point of interest — for example, an
infected body part or a cancer cell — for maximum effect.
Think of the delivery mechanism as the “submarine” in Fantastic Voyage, and
the drug as the people inside aiming a “laser” to destroy (say) a blood clot.
Imagine the possibilities to replace current chemotherapy, an arduous
process by which “anticancer” drugs are pumped through the body — killing
not only cancer cells but also healthy cells — causing severe side effects. If
we can deliver these drugs directly to the cancer cells, this will limit their
effect on the healthy cells. This benefit is our motivation.

Chapter 11: The Fantastic Voyage into Medical Applications

In this section, first we take a look at the building blocks of the delivery
mechanism, explain how they congregate and form into the mechanism, and
then discuss how they can be used to deliver the drug.
Oil and water don’t mix
The building blocks to our delivery mechanism are molecules called
amphiphiles — amphi from the Greek word for “both,” and phile from the
word for “loving.” Such a molecule “loves” both oil and water — and it has
two distinct parts:
 Head: This group of atoms is hydrophilic (water-loving).
 Tail: This group of atoms is hydrophobic (water-fearing/oil-loving).
Figure 11-2 illustrates how such a molecule is arranged.
Yeah, we know, “hydrophobia” used to be a synonym for “rabies” — but
what’s going on here is a chemical process, not an infection.
Okay, so what are amphiphiles good for? One great application is laundry
detergent: Since oil and water don’t mix, oils from our skin that are deposited
on our clothes would rather remain on the fabric than dissolve in the water.
Soap molecules with hydrophobic tails that are soluble in oil therefore
become embedded in those tiny grease globs. As you can imagine, given
enough soap molecules, the hydrophilic heads surround the grease; the
hydrophobic tails duck inside the grease — leaving the grease glob water-
soluble. (These types of amphiphiles are called surfactants — they’re “surface-
active,” performing their molecular duty at the interface of two different 
Hydrophilic

substances.) When the grease is surrounded by a water-soluble coating, the
entire glob can dissolve — which removes the stain from your clothes.
Amphiphiles do dissolve in water but they prefer to keep their hydrophobic
tails away from the water molecules. Not only do they congregate near the
surface with their tails off the water and their heads down, but they also
group together to create spherical structures called micelles — which leads
us right into our next section.
Micelles (your cells?)
Say we continue to add amphiphiles — in this case, laundry detergent — into
water in a washing machine. Since the detergent molecules’ hydrophobic
tails want to keep away from the water molecules, the detergent molecules
congregate near the surface — with their heads in the water and their tails up
in the air. Eventually we’ve saturated the surface of the water with detergent
molecules; they look elsewhere to keep their hydrophobic tails from interact-
ing with water. As you might guess, they tend to group together into spheres
with their hydrophobic tails inside and their hydrophilic heads outside
(nicely illustrated in Figure 11-3). This is the same concept when the deter-
gent surrounds a grease glob, but this time, without the grease — the tails are
what attract the detergent molecules together.
These spherical groupings of amphiphile molecules — called micelles — are
created when enough amphiphiles are present that they reach a critical
micelle concentration — so many that they feel compelled to form micelles
instead of just congregating toward the surface of the liquid. The nice thing
about these nano-size capsules is that they create themselves — put enough
amphiphiles in one place, and you get them automatically. The nature of the
amphiphiles (every one has one hydrophobic side and one hydrophilic side)
is the driving force behind their organizing themselves into micelles. That’s
especially handy, given their small size — it would take a very long time to
stick ’em together individually (I’m certainly not going to do it). The organiza-
tion is very give-and-take — amphiphiles come and go within the micelle.
Micelles come in a variety of orientations. If we introduce amphiphiles into an
oily liquid — as opposed to introducing them into water — micelles are still
created, but now you get hydrophilic heads on the inside and hydrophobic
tails on the outside — a reverse micelle, as shown in Figure 11-4.
At high concentrations of amphiphiles (higher than the critical micelle con-
centration), micelles may form bilayers — a reverse micelle surrounded by a
regular micelle, as seen in Figure 11-5. These one-within-another micelles are
called vesicles — which have an intriguing (if sketchy) resemblance to biolog-
ical cells.
253
Chapter 11: The Fantastic Voyage into Medical Applications

The soap molecules described earlier in this chapter represent one type of
amphiphile. Human cell walls consist of natural amphiphiles called phospho-
lipids. They look sort of like mutant soap amphiphiles — each molecule has
two hydrophobic tails instead of one. Like micelles, the phospholipid
amphiphiles are loosely bonded to each other and move about the shell of
the vesicle. That’s where the resemblance to biological cells gets sketchy:
Not all cellular walls are as mobile — some animal cells are rigid, and red
blood cells have a weblike protein skeleton — and such structures and prop-
erties are unique to living cells.
Micelles have another useful industrial characteristic: They can be any of var-
ious sizes. The internal cavities of small micelles are mostly made up of the
hydrophilic tails (as in our original description of a micelle); larger micelles
not only have their tails in the center but also include some water-insoluble
substances in there (for example, that hapless grease glob). These sizes are
tunable — by varying what’s in the liquid, scientists can dictate the size of the
micelles that form. They can all be the same size or they can be of various
sizes.

Special delivery
When amphiphiles form into a vesicle, you have a microscopic structure that
has some handy uses — for example, as a package for delivering drugs to
specific locations in the body. Recall that amphiphiles form only weak bonds
among themselves — for the most part, they’re free to move around within
the shell of the vesicle. Individual vesicles can break apart into two smaller
vesicles or join together into a bigger vesicle. That means you can inject a
substance into — and extract a substance from — the vesicle. Endocytosis
(endo — into; cyto — hollow vessel) is a process whereby cells absorb parti-
cles by enveloping them with the help of vesicles formed from the cell wall,
as shown in Figure 11-6. (It works kind of like the ravenous glop in that
Creature Feature standby, The Blob.) Conversely, exocytosis is the removal of
particles by enveloping them in a vesicle and releasing them outside the cell
wall, as shown in Figure 11-7.

Part IV: Living Healthier Lives 

What we have here is a way to grab microscopic things and move them
around. These handy bilayer vesicles act as liposomes — cells used to deliver
drugs or genetic material into a cell. To deliver drugs, for example, you pre-
pare the liposomes outside the body, encapsulating drug molecules in them.
You then deliver the liposomes as micro capsules into the bloodstream,
where they make their way to the target cells and release the drug. You can
even determine what kind of cellular interaction goes on between the lipo-
some and the cells by varying the type of phospholipids used.
Following are the three main methods that liposomes use to deliver drugs to
a cell:
 Liposomes may stick to the surface of the cell walls, slowly diffusing the
drugs into the cell. (See the part labeled “a” in Figure 11-8.) This method
is good for consistent, time-released drugs — varying the structure of
the liposome can vary its willingness to stick, vary the drug’s release
time, or both. A controlled release can respond to the needs of the 
body — a rise in the level of cholesterol or sugar (for example) can dis-
rupt the surface of the vesicle, delivering the drug appropriately.
 Endocytosis (shown in the “b” part of Figure 11-8) is the passage of the
vesicle into the cell, after which the vesicle breaks down and the drug
molecules are delivered.
 The “c” part of Figure 11-8 shows an uncommon method: The liposome
fuses with the cell wall and delivers its contents into the cell.

Chapter 11: The Fantastic Voyage into Medical Applications

Phospholipids are not the only drug-delivery trick available to us. If we want
a bit more durable packaging, we can use polymers to create drug-delivery
vesicles. This method allows greater flexibility and structural stability. Trigger
molecules can be attached to the outer vesicle wall, allowing it to release in
response to contact with a particular cell. Additionally, the bonds between
polymer amphiphiles are stronger than those with the phospholipids — 
minimizing the chance of accidental release. This strength also allows for a
controlled release (if desired), and keeps the vesicles stable prior to injection.
Drug delivery at the nano scale has two important elements: the ability to
target specific cells and controlled release. Liposomes provide both, so
they’re sure to be an important part of nanotechnological drug development.
They offer three particular advantages:
 They have already provided a useful vehicle for successful drug delivery.
For example, they have been used to deliver doxorubicin and anthacy-
cline, both drugs that treat cancer. Diabetics have also taken advantage
of the trigger-release mechanism of liposomes — when glucose levels
are high, the vesicles release insulin.
 They have been used and proposed for gene therapy. As gene-therapy
tools they can be set to encapsulate and deliver segments of DNA and
RNA directly into cells to replace specific faulty genes. This technique
promises to treat a variety of diseases.
 They penetrate the skin, delivering molecules to the deeper layers of
cells. This is of great importance to the cosmetics industry for skin
creams, sunscreens, vitamins, and even tanning agents.
Unfortunately, the body can quickly identify the liposomes as foreign intrud-
ers and destroy the delivery vehicle. In response, researchers have devel-
oped “stealth liposomes,” coating the liposomes with large, neutral polymers.
These barriers interact weakly with the antibodies that attack foreign sub-
stances, allowing them to remain in the body for longer periods of time —
very important if the liposome is to deliver a time-release drug.
Stepping it up with C60
One other handy chemical tool is a buckyball (that soccer-ball-shaped mol-
ecule we discuss at length in Chapter 4). It provides the support structure to
an amphiphile, which in turn can be used to create drug-delivering micelles.
Figure 11-9 shows the C60 buckyball — the molecule made of 60 carbon 
atoms — surrounded by attached side chains. The top half of the structure
acts as the hydrophilic head; the bottom half acts as the hydrophobic tail.
258
Part IV: Living Healthier Lives 

The interesting development of this is that these C60-based amphiphiles form
vesicles of different sizes, depending on what pH levels are present. It’s also
known that sites of infection have pH levels different from those in the rest of
the body — and scientists can tune the amphiphile to respond to specific pH
levels. As you can imagine, using C60 vesicles as a drug-delivery system looks
very promising — the vesicles go throughout the body and release a drug at
all sites of infection — those sites with a specific pH level — and nowhere
else. Figure 11-10 shows a vesicle utilizing C60 amphiphiles that are encapsu-
lating a drug. (Keep in mind that even though the image looks circular, its
structure is spherical.)
C60 can be used as a “molecular pincushion” attaching drugs and protein
detectors to its shell. Fundamentally, C60 is nontoxic and can be modified
rapidly and easily. Imagine modifying the C60 molecule to disrupt the AIDS
virus’s ability to reproduce. Since the AIDS virus changes and adapts, the
ability to modify C60 drugs quickly in response to changes in the AIDS virus is
a key to longer-term effectiveness.
259
Chapter 11: The Fantastic Voyage into Medical Applications
Brother, can you spare a dendrimer?
A dendrimer is an artificial, polymer-based mol-
ecule that resembles a foam ball with tree
sprigs shooting out of it in every direction. A typ-
ical dendrimer is the size of a typical protein 
(3 nanometers across), held together with
strong chemical bonds, but also containing a
great number of voids — in effect, pockets for
carrying payload. The voids make up a great
amount of surface area, and can be tailored to
different sizes, allowing great control and flexi-
bility in their applications. One such use is to
transport DNA into cells for gene therapy — an
alternative to genetically modified viruses.
Viruses are troublesome as delivery vehicles for
therapeutic DNA; the body hates foreign sub-
stances, and even a benign virus can trigger
severe immune reactions. Dendrimers, on the
other hand, covertly bypass the immune
defenses and slip DNA into target cells.
Dendrimers may also be used for drug delivery.
Given their ability to be controlled, they may be
designed to swell and liberate their contents
only when the appropriate trigger molecules 
are present. Additionally, they may be used for
diagnostics — they may deposit a type of DNA
that makes a diseased cell glow. (More on diag-
nostics can be found in Chapter 10.)

Cooking Cancer with Nanoshells
The body is constantly replacing old cells with new ones; the old, damaged
cells are deliberately “killed” in a process called apoptosis. Sometimes, how-
ever, mutations occur so that some new cells form when the body doesn’t
need them and old cells don’t die when they should — which, by the way, is a
basic definition of cancer. Cancer cells bypass apoptosis and form a mass of
tissue called a tumor. (See Figure 11-11 for a graphical depiction of normal cell
division versus cancer mutation.)
As it happens, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) has identified four areas of
the body as the locations of the most common forms of cancer: prostate
gland, breast, lung, and colon. Not surprisingly, the amount of spending on
cancer research is particularly high, especially for these four types of cancer,
as Table 11-1 clearly shows. The NCI’s total budget for cancer research back
in 2003 was set at $4.6 billion, so you can see the motivation to find alterna-
tive (more effective and less expensive) ways to combat cancer.
Imagine having a way to deliver the knockout punch directly to those four
areas. No sooner said . . .
Enter nanoshells — a unique, noninvasive way to detect and obliterate cancer
cells.

Nanospectra Biosciences, Inc., is a company now capitalizing on the nanopar-
ticle’s potential to eradiate cancer — and they’ve come up with their own
approach: They start off with a very small glass bead and coat it with gold.
Here’s why:
 Gold, an inert metal, can absorb quite a bit of light. Its optical absorp-
tion rate varies depending upon how thick a layer of gold is applied.
 Gold happens to be biocompatible with the human body. It can stay in
there without corroding or otherwise reacting, as any dentist can tell you.
261
Chapter 11: The Fantastic Voyage into Medical Applications

This means you can vary the size of the glass bead and the thickness of the
gold layer to scatter or absorb different wavelengths of light. Figure 11-12
illustrates the scattering wavelength with a 60nm core and various shell
thicknesses.
When dealing with medical applications, we’re interested in the near-infrared
wavelength (650–1050nm) because this is the wavelength that transmits well
through biological tissue.

“Why does the near-infrared transmit through biological tissue?” We’re glad
you asked. The body is mostly made up of water. Our goal is to find the best
spectral region for optical imaging. This region, as it turns out, is between 800
and 1300nm — and is given the special title of water window. We are able to
cater our nanoshells to either absorb or scatter within this range for optimal
effectiveness through human tissue.
Nanoshells can be used to “cook” cancer cells (absorption), but they can also
be used for imaging (scattering). That’s a process of absorption and scatter-
ing. A handy example is the color of the shirt you wear. If you wear a black
shirt during a summer day, you tend to feel warmer because the black color
absorbs the light; if you wear a white shirt on the same summer day, you feel
cooler because the white color reflects the light. In much the same way,
nanoshells can absorb light and give off heat (like that trendy black shirt of
yours), but they can also reflect (like the white shirt), allowing a camera to
pick up the scattered light.

But let’s get back to the thrilling story of Nanospectra Biosciences, Inc. They
create their nanoshells by first growing perfect silica (glass) cores and then
coating the cores with a special amine. (Amines are organic compounds 
that can be used as “attachment” points for structures.) Recall that in Fig-
ure 11-9 (in the previous section), C60 had certain chains hanging from it —
chains that changed the amphiphiles’ properties and the way they reacted
with various pH levels. The process of attaching these chains is called

functionalization — attaching groups of molecules with a specific function in
mind. Using C60 as the support structure and functionalizing the side chains
gives us a unique amphiphile capable of doing the good stuff we want done.
In this case, the amines are functionalized to the glass core — which will act
like glue for our next step.
As a functional molecular group, the amine works best for attaching (gluing)
gold particles to the glass core. After the amines are attached to the core, the
coated silica particles are suspended in a bath of smaller gold particles (less
than 2 nm wide). Figure 11-13 shows some gold particles attaching to the
amines. A further reaction involving additional chemicals causes more gold
particles to attach, creating a shell roughly 10 nm thick. That shell can best
absorb light that has a wavelength of 810 nm. Figure 11-14 illustrates the final
nanoshell product; Figure 11-15 shows actual images of the silica core sur-
rounded by varying thicknesses of gold particles.

So now we have a gold-plated nanoshell, not currently doing anything of
importance — until we prepare it for medical applications by attaching anti-
bodies to the outside. Why antibodies? Well, antibodies are the body’s way of
detecting and flagging the presence of foreign substances — a fact we’ve
known about for quite a while. It turns out, however, scientists can now use
known cancer cells to create mass-produced, protein-based antibodies in the
lab. These antibodies can then be attached to the outside of our gold-plated
nanoshells which, when they’re injected into the body, then attach themselves
to these specific cancer cells — and only to cancer cells.

The search process isn’t instantaneous — it takes a few hours for the
nanoshells to circulate through the body. Figure 11-16 is a graphical represen-

In vitro is a nice start, but Nanospectra Biosciences, Inc., knew that at some
point they’d have to go in vivo — within the living. In subsequent experi-
ments, live mice were injected with tumor cells. When the tumors reached a
particular size, the nanoshells were injected. After six hours, an 808nm laser
was used for three minutes to activate the nanoshells. The chart in Figure 11-18
shows the tumor size at Day 0 (treatment day) and Day 10. The nanoshell
therapy for seven cases shows no sign of the tumor. For those treated only
with the laser (without nanoshells, eight cases) and for those left untreated
as an experimental control (nine cases), the tumors continued to grow. The
graph in Figure 11-19 shows that all mice with the nanoshell treatment lived
the entire 60 days; those treated only with the laser (or without treatment)
were euthanized by Day 19, or when the tumor grew to more than 5 percent
of their body weight. Yes, it’s grim — but cancer is grim business, and
nanoshell treatment offers real hope.
In fact, this result shows tremendous promise — a therapy that can actually
destroy cancer cells with minimal invasiveness. This process offers the great-
est initial hope for breast and prostate cancers — which appear predomi-
nantly at the body’s surface, where laser light can be most effective.
A further advantage to nanoshell treatment is detection: Nanoshells can be
configured to scatter light as well as absorb it. This scattering can be used to
create an image of where the nanoshells congregate. A possible future treat-
ment could have the cancer patient visit the doctor periodically to be injected
with special nanoshells coated with antibodies that would search for various
types of cancer. Then electronic scanning would find the nanoshell congrega-
tions and allow pinpoint targeting of the laser — which would then cook the
tumors — all in one afternoon. Human trials for this technique will begin
within the next few years.

Biomimetics
If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then technology has been flatter-
ing nature for centuries. Biomimetics is the science of mimicking biology —
and no, we’re not talking about imitating the mating call of the common loon
(not just now, anyway). Nature has a few billion years’ lead over humans in
complex bioengineering — and we’ve figured out that nature can teach us a
thing or two about functional design. Humans, for example, have studied and
synthesized rubber and spider silk, both incredibly important natural materi-
als. Synthetic rubber helped us win World War II — military items such as
engine belts and tires relied upon synthetic rubber after the Axis powers cut
off our natural rubber supplies from Malaysia. And where would we be if we
hadn’t started mimicking the shape of a bird’s wing and incorporating it into
airplane designs? Still walking, I assume.
The biomimetic goal is to figure out how nature does what it does, and then
develop techniques that beat nature at its own game. Humanity is like an
apprentice who learns from — and then supersedes — the master. A telling
example is the medical advances that have improved oxygen delivery and
artery expansion (described in the next sections). Within the human body,
biomimetics takes on a new goal: to encourage the body to help repair and
regenerate itself. Two current examples are joint-replacement therapy and
tissue scaffolding, both of which combine biology and chemistry — and
manipulate biochemical processes at the nano scale.

Synthetic materials do not make good implants — they wear out relatively
fast, and can’t regenerate themselves the way bone can. They also have an
effect on the body — and are affected by the body — in ways that limit their
usefulness. For example, the average lifetime of orthopedic implants (includ-
ing replacement hips and knees) is about 15 years — not a happy prospect
for a 20-year-old, who may need multiple replacements over a lifetime. The
implants must be replaced because the patient’s bone resorbs — disappears
from around the implant — which loosens the implant and makes it easier to
break. Similarly, vascular grafts using artificial blood vessels have remained
only 25-percent functional after they’ve been in place for five years.
So what’s the problem here? In a word, size: Synthetic material made of parti-
cles bigger than 1 micron won’t let natural tissue regenerate, which shortens
the life of the implanted device. One answer is nano-size materials — made of
particles with dimensions smaller than 100nm.
Improving oxygen delivery
The trouble with breathing is that it’s only the beginning. After you inhale,
the oxygen has to get to your internal tissues via your bloodstream. Tissue
damage results from poor blood flow and inadequate oxygen supply. In fact,
the victims of heart attack and stroke suffer greater damage from a lack of
oxygen than from the initial attack. Blood transfusions have saved lives but
have three main drawbacks:
 Blood type: The body rejects blood that doesn’t match what it makes
for itself.
 Viral contamination: Viruses, especially the sneaky ones such as HIV,
are always a risk.
 Perish ability: Natural blood has a short shelf life, which is one reason
it’s often in short supply.
Even with good matching of blood type and effective screening of viruses,
creating an artificial blood remains attractive: Imagine a plentiful supply of
new, virus-free blood that could match any blood type — and even work
better than natural blood.
The ideal blood substitute has been hard to come up with so far. One
approach uses purified hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying protein in blood
cells. Hemoglobin doesn’t have a specific blood type, can be sterilized, and
may be stored for more than a year. Unfortunately, it was quickly discovered
that using this purified hemoglobin by itself as a blood substitute proved
highly toxic to human kidneys. The purified hemoglobin broke down into
smaller units than normal hemoglobin and quickly accumulated in the kid-
neys — to toxic concentrations — which put severe limits on how (and if) it
could be used.
269
Chapter 11: The Fantastic Voyage into Medical Applications

This is where nanotechnology offers a couple of new and different solutions.
Solution # 1 links several hemoglobin molecules into a larger complex, as in
Figure 11-20. Modifying hemoglobin — say, by fusing two hemoglobin sub-
units into one chain — forms a stable, complex molecule that carries oxygen
extremely well — and is too big to be filtered out by the kidneys before the
oxygen reaches its goal.
Solution # 2 takes unaltered hemoglobin and encapsulates it in liposomes —
essentially the same way liposomes are used for drug delivery. (See the
“Special delivery” section, earlier in this chapter, for all the details.) Now,
these liposome-based, artificial red blood cells don’t provoke an immune
response (that’s the good news) — but they are removed from the blood-
stream by the same process that disposes of defective red blood cells (that’s
the bad news). In the face of this hurdle, scientists have modified the outer
shell of the liposome so it resembles a healthy red blood cell. Otherwise the
body would see it as broadcasting to the world, “I’m defective, I’m defective.
Trash me.”
How does this microscopic masquerade work? By modifying the lipids that
make up the liposome so they resemble the sugars that coat the red blood
cell. This coating of sugars varies by blood type; if the liposome looks like a
cell of the correct blood type, the body lets it go about its business.

units of

Part IV: Living Healthier Lives 

Solution # 3 makes use of biodegradable polymers that have been fashioned
into nanocapsules to transport hemoglobin. Such polymers (for example,
polylactide and polyglycolactide) degrade in the body, producing water and
carbon dioxide as harmless byproducts. Such nanocapsules have some
advantages over our liposome transport mechanism — these are stronger,
more porous, and can carry more hemoglobin.
They can also carry the stuff needed to keep the hemoglobin from generating
toxic chemicals (such as the oxygen radicals in this case). Natural red blood
cells contain enzymes that destroy oxygen radicals — and since there’s plenty
of room in polymer nanocapsules, the detoxifying enzymes can go along with
the hemoglobin. Result: a safe, nontoxic, effective blood substitute.
Now for Solution # 4, which admittedly sounds a bit farfetched — but, hey,
what chapter of this book would be complete without something that sounds
a little like science fiction? In the 1989 movie The Abyss, director James
Cameron introduced a Fluid Breathing System (based on actual, successful
experiments with mice) that pumps an oxygen-rich fluid into the lungs so a
diver can breathe despite the great pressure at extreme depths — and avoid
“the bends” on the way to the surface. The concept is kind of like a baby
breathing in the womb, with amniotic fluid instead of air.
Thinking nanotechnologically, you can take this concept a step further and
introduce tiny spheres filled with high-pressure oxygen into the bloodstream.
These tiny spheres, known as respirocytes, could be made to release oxygen
at a constant rate. In effect, a respirocyte does the work of a red blood cell —
but more efficiently, and with a bit more of an exotic mechanical flair. Fig-
ure 11-21 shows how such a respirocyte could look: A rotary assembly
around the respirocyte exchanges oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water — and
provides locomotion through the body. Figure 11-22 is an artist’s conception
of respirocytes in action.
Expanding an artery from the inside
Clogged arteries are not just about inconvenient traffic jams. Annually, $53
billion is spent to treat strokes — and in 80 percent of these strokes, a blood
clot clogs a blood vessel to the brain. According to the American Stroke
Association, strokes are the third-leading cause of death among Americans
(heart disease and cancer are the top two).

One (more or less traditional) way to combat clogged vessels is to thread a
tiny corkscrew through an artery to clear the blockage and restore blood
flow. This tiny corkscrew, called the Merci Retriever, has recently been
approved by the FDA and has undergone successful tests. There are some
limitations to the Merci Retriever, however: It must be used within three
hours of suffering a stroke, the clot must be visibly located, and the blockage
must be accessible by inserting the device into a blood vessel. These prob-
lems, as daunting as they are, can be addressed with nanotechnology:
 Find the problem: Properly and accurately identify the location of the
blood clot. What’s needed here is good imaging (as described in Chap-
ter 10) that can find a blood clot.
 Get the device to the site: Access the too-small-to-reach places — small
enough to be easily threaded into an artery.
 Do it in a timely manner: That means — among other things — avoiding
the need for extensive preparation in an operating room. If we could
move the imaging equipment and Merci Retriever to the ambulance, we
could treat patients at the scene — increasing their odds for successful
recovery.
One further question: When you’ve created and used a mechanism that can
physically destroy a clot, how do you prevent the problem from happening
again? In the past, we’ve repaired ailing arteries by using tissue grafts from
patients themselves, thus ensuring no negative immune response. However,
this is not always possible because the harvesting sites (the places where we
get the patient’s tissue graft) may become infected — and tissue grafts in gen-
eral have limited shelf life. These factors have led to a great demand for an
artificial material that has the appropriate mechanical properties needed for
arteries: tough but flexible, adaptable to surrounding tissues, and not subject
to buckling, kinking, or allergic reactions.
One solution is to work with the blood vessel you’re stuck with — and simply
improve upon it by introducing a stent — an expandable wire mesh used to
keep the vessel open. (Think of it as a tube made of chicken wire.) Figure 11-23
shows the process of introducing the stent. The leftmost panel in Figure 11-23
shows a balloon placed at the area of blockage and inflated to make room for
the stent. The balloon is then deflated and the stent is placed in position
(second panel). The balloon is then inflated once more to expand the stent,
which stays expanded as shown in the third panel. Finally, the balloon is
deflated and removed, leaving the stent in place, allowing blood to flow natu-
rally, as shown in the final panel.
273
Chapter 11: The Fantastic Voyage into Medical Applications

This approach is all fine and dandy, but it ain’t nanotechnology. The stent 
we describe here is as traditional in its engineering as a wooden tongue
depressor — not exactly cutting-edge. And traditional stents are not problem-
free. Sometimes they actually cause clogging — the problem the stent was
supposed to correct in the first place. The result is as serious as its name
sounds: Thrombosis is the deposition of coagulated blood material, formed
from a two-step process: coagulation of some of the proteins in blood and the
depositing of cells called platelets. Once the blood coagulates, the platelets
come in and stick to the forming clot, which in turn coagulates more blood,
which in turn leads to deposits of platelets, and so on until blood flow is
blocked. Natural blood vessels are supposed to combat clogging by lining the
arteries with endothelial cells, which produce heparin (to prevent coagula-
tion) and prostacyclin (to prevent platelet deposits). Traditional stents have
no way of working with endothelial cells, so they have no effective way of
staving off thrombosis.
Advanced Bio Prosthetic Surfaces (ABPS), a company based in San Antonio,
Texas, feels it may have come up with a solution to our little stent problem.
They’ve taken as one of their research and development goals combining
technology from the semiconductor industry with the medical industry, and
it just so happens that they’ve lighted upon the idea of using shape memory
alloys such as Nitinol (ably discussed by yours truly in Chapter 5) as material
for stents. Using a shape-memory alloy is a great idea because it remains flex-
ible but springs back to maintaining its shape.

274
Part IV: Living Healthier Lives 

Now, the use of this alloy is not new in stents, but ABPS has come up with a
new process for creating the stent using this metal. Old processes involved
macro-scale manufacturing — which introduced micro-scale cracks on the
surface of the stent. These cracks, as small as they were, could irritate the
artery, causing complications such as infection or blood-flow restriction. At
ABPS, the stents are created by sputter deposition — a method of creating a
thin film of metal by “sputtering” fine particles of Nitinol onto a surface. This
allows layer-by-layer, atom-by-atom fabrication of materials, virtually free
from contaminants and impurities.
The old method of making a stent causes the surface to be plagued with
splinters and other imperfections that could react with the body. The new
method involves covering the stent with a nanoporous coating — not only
making the stent less likely to trigger inflammation, but also thinner, stronger,
and more flexible. As an added bonus, it promotes tissue incorporation and
endothelialization — the creation of the endothelial cells that prevent 
clotting.
Replacing joints with better stuff
Thus far, nanotechnology offers almost magical transformations of materials,
strengthening our current versions of standard steel, glass, and plastic into
something revolutionary. (Don’t believe us? Check out Chapter 5.) When
applied to biological materials, nanotech will accomplish similar dramatic
changes. To do so, however, it will have to compensate for biomaterials’
dynamic (ever-changing) construction. Not sure what’s so dynamic about
biomaterials? Read on to find out.
Bones are actually a sort of process: At the cellular level, they undergo con-
stant repair and rebuilding as they fight gravity, allowing our body to effec-
tively adapt to our environment. (That’s pretty dynamic, right?) What makes
bone so versatile is its basic building material: hydroxyapatite. Osteoblasts
(bone-forming cells) secrete this stuff within a matrix of collagen (the main
protein of connective tissue, which is why it shows up so often in beauty
products). The body continuously reabsorbs the hydroxyapatite crystals and
re-deposits new material in their place. What that process does is adjust the
bone’s thickness in response to changes in the body’s distribution of weight.
Figure 11-24 shows an excellent top-down hierarchy of strength in the materi-
als that make up bone — comparing actual bone cells to collagen fibers and
to individual collagen molecules (each a mere 3nm in length).
275
Chapter 11: The Fantastic Voyage into Medical Applications

All that specialized strength gives human bioengineers quite a challenge.
Implants are typically made of highly inert material — stuff designed to inter-
act as little as possible with the body in order to minimize the implant’s inter-
ference with the normal growth and function of surrounding cells. With
traditional implants — like the ones presently used for replacement hips —
the bone cells eventually disappear from around the implant, loosening it and
making it prone to breaking. Why is the bone being reabsorbed? Well, the
body figures the bone isn’t needed. Since the implant is now bearing the
greatest amount of load, the body responds by “pulling back” on bone pro-
duction in that area. Just as the osteoblasts are stimulated into generating
more bone when they’re confronted by more stresses, they can also be told
to back off when (falsely) the burden seems to be less. Result: Bone genera-
tion falls off, and then the body starts to reabsorb existing bone. The prob-
lem is how to keep the bone in the business of rebuilding itself.
Looking specifically at hip implants, another source of contention is the plas-
tic that is used in the socket portion. A traditional hip implant has a metal
ball and a plastic socket, as shown in Figure 11-25. As the metal rubs against
the plastic socket, plastic particles break off, and the body responds to the
foreign fragments with inflammation, resulting in bone loss at the femur.
Researchers at the University of Tokyo are developing a biocompatible poly-
mer joint that resembles phospholipids (the cellular membranes we discuss

chapter). Using such a polymer joint fools the body into not attacking the
residual flakes; no inflammatory response means no weakening of the bone.
This is an example of designing implants that interact with the body on its
own terms — an improvement over the old school of thought that largely
ignored the interaction between implant and body.
Bioactive materials have the ability to interact with living tissue — and are
the most promising approach to ensuring a strong, long-lasting adhesive
interface between the implant and the surrounding tissue. Already some
bioactive materials have done such a good job at mimicking natural bone
that tissues have chemically bonded to their surfaces, successfully persuad-
ing the body that the implant is not really a foreign substance.
One bioactive material already in clinical use — and showing tremendous
promise — is being developed by Doxa, a Swedish biomaterials company.
They have come up with a process that involves injecting the affected joint
with a soft material that then hardens at the molecular level, bonding a dam-
aged bone together. More specifically, the material reacts to body fluids to
form apatite, the body’s own ceramic. The resulting material is better than
existing artificial-bone material; it’s as strong and hard as actual bone. Such a
material is considered a “bioactive ceramic” — the body activates the mater-
ial and helps form it into a ceramic. The approach combines various sophisti-
cated understandings of materials, chemistry, and biology at the molecular
level, which is what nanotechnology is all about.

So glad you asked. In this part, we look at three segments
of the world that are putting a lot of time, energy, brain-
power, and money into nanotech: corporations, govern-
ment, and higher education. Chapter 12 shows you some
companies who are already reaping rewards from nano
products on the market today — and others who are heav-

and agencies are working hand-in-hand to ensure that we
have the knowledge and workforce to move nanotechnol-

roam around the campus nanotech facilities of several uni-
versities who are getting small in a big way.

lthough the big nano emphasis (so to speak) in today’s corporate world
is in the semiconductor industry — where the reality of making elec-
tronics smaller is close at hand — other industries are exploring nanotech-
nology as well. These include companies making materials such as cloth and
rubber stronger as well as those bioengineering companies exploring the
uses of nanotechnology in making medical testing and treatment devices
more precise.
Here, then, are approximately ten industries and a host of companies that are
putting their money where their corporate mouths are when it comes to
research and development in nanotechnology.
Semiconductor Types Are 
Completely into Nano
One of the most obvious applications of nanotechnology is in making com-
puter chips (and other components) tinier and tinier in order to produce
smaller electronic devices. Why? Well, people just seem to love small. As 

sci-fi author Arthur C. Clarke observed, “any sufficiently advanced technol-
ogy is indistinguishable from magic.” When technology makes things tiny,
people are intrigued by the voodoo of it all.
Just think about portable phones which shrank from the size of a loaf of
bread to the size of a candy bar over the last few decades; people have 
gobbled up these small electronic devices like — well, candy.
The semiconductor field is a 100-billion-dollar-plus industry, so it’s a big factor
in today’s nanotechnology research. Interestingly, these companies are coop-
erating in moving the technology forward — because every company will ben-
efit from the research and be able to release new products in their own lines.
Organizations such as the Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC, an arm
of the Semiconductor Industry Association) are funding research at universi-
ties such as Georgia Tech and Carnegie Mellon — and sharing the results of
that research across the industry.
Bell Labs (www.bell-labs.com) has a partnership with the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to work on micro-electromechanical 
systems (MEMS) as a basis for the spatial light modulators (SLMs) used in
maskless lithography. Lithography has to do with printing patterns on semi-
conductors. Traditionally, lithography is done with costly pattern “masks” 
that can only be used once each. Bell Labs technology does away with those
masks, saving money and making it possible to build smaller circuits.
Other leading lights in this sector are Intel (www.intel.com), HP (www.hp.
com), and IBM (www.ibm.com) because of their interest in the manufacture 
|of computer chips and parts.
 Intel started exploring nanotechnology in 2000 — and began shipping
sub-100-nanometer transistors for its chips in 2003. Their future focus is
on silicon-based nanotechnology; they project that a new quantum-well
transistor they’re working on could use a tenth of the power while still
delivering current levels of performance.
 HP is working on getting rid of transistors and replacing them with 
molecular-scale switches known as crossbar latches. These switches
would be initially used in computer memory and could eventually be
used to process logic operations.
 IBM, one of the biggest spenders, has said that self-assembly techniques
for building products such as a nanocrystal FLASH memory device will
be used in pilot projects within the next two to four years.

Mining the Medical Possibilities 
of Nanotechnology
The potential applications for nanotechnology in medicine are many, but
some of these applications need a bit longer development time than you’d
find in some other industries. That’s due in part to the complex interactions
among all those tiny components, as well as tight regulations for new prod-
ucts. In the future, medical tools will be made more inexpensively, diagnosis
will become more accurate, and we can expect tiny, inexpensive sensors and
implants to provide both automated monitoring and semiautomatic treat-
ment. Medical imaging and in-vivo drug delivery are also being explored.
Nanospectra Biosciences (www.nanospectra.com) is one company pushing
the envelope in nano-medical applications today. They have patented
nanoshell particles used in noninvasive medical therapies. These nanoparti-
cles can actually be tuned to scatter or absorb light in specific wavelengths.
This makes possible tasks such as destroying specific cancer cells with an
infrared laser, welding tissues to heal wounds, and something called photo-
coagulation (coagulation with a laser) that cuts off the blood supply to
unhealthy cells, slowing down degeneration in people with diseases such 
as diabetes and cancer.
Hitachi (www.hitachi.com) established Hitachi High-Technologies in 2001 
to pursue nanotechnology in a variety of settings, including medical testing 
in conjunction with Hitachi Medical Corporation and Hitachi Instruments
Group. Hitachi is exploring DNA analysis through the use of atomic and mole-
cular devices. Hitachi also recently partnered with Oxford and Cambridge in
a joint venture called Nanotech.org. They manufactured the world’s tiniest
test tube (you could fit about 300 million of them into a grain of sand). What
283
Chapter 12: Industries Going Small

people will do with these test “tubettes” is limited only by the human imagi-
nation. (For now you’ll just have to imagine what they look like.)
Dow Chemical (www.dow.com), through its division DowPharma, is actively
involved in drug solubilization technology, working on altering nanoparticle
size and properties to make drugs easier for the body to absorb. It’s a key
aspect of effectively delivering small-molecule drugs to where they can do
the most good.

Making Better Materials 
from Tires to Clothing
Many companies are already using nanotechnology to make better materials —
from the rubber used for tires to stain-repellent fabrics for clothing.
The name Zyvex pops up whenever you search for nanotechnology companies
online. Founded in 1997, this company’s slogan is “Providing Nanotechnology
Solutions — Today(tm)” — and so they are. Zyvex has a line of nano-additives
and enhanced carbon nanotubes that add strength to composite materials.
Using these they can improve thermal, electrical, and mechanical properties of
various materials. Zyvex counts among its customers aerospace, electronics,
telecommunication, and healthcare companies.
Are you a nanotech investor? In this era of nano speculation, Zyvex is one of
the few companies with strong funding and solid business practices that is
actually making money off of nano products and services. They’re a private
company, but if they ever go public, call your broker!
In clothing manufacture, Gore-Tex (www.gore-tex.com) offers a jacket made
of a waterproof polymer membrane with embedded nano-size carbon parti-
cles that resist taking on a static charge. Such anti-static protection could be
used, for example, in firefighters’ suits to help them avoid static electricity
that could spark fire in a hazardous situation. Nano-Tex (www.nano-tex.com)
uses nanotechnology to produce Nano-Care stain-resistant clothing. Nano-Tex
284
Part V: Investing in Nanotech 

won’t give away how they incorporate their spill-resistant technology, but it’s
likely that they coat the fibers with a polymer. Because the fibers are coated
and then woven into fabric, the cloth maintains its stain resistance even 
after many washes — and the fabric maintains its soft texture and feel. They
license the technology to others, including clothing giants The Gap, Nike, 
and Old Navy. Many American and European textile companies are counting
on their high-tech nano edge to survive as they compete with countries that
can provide lower-cost labor.
Nano-based materials run the gamut, even appearing in the sports arena.
Babolat (www.babolat.com), a French maker of tennis rackets, for instance,
produces a racket that uses carbon nanotubes for higher torsion in the
racket and flexibility of the racket strings. Other companies are developing
tennis and golf balls that fly straighter because of the nanotechnology inside.
InMat (www.inmat.com) is using nanotechnology for everything from packag-
ing that keeps food fresher to tires that hold air longer (and are lighter in
weight for improved mileage). InMat is also into sports, with soccer balls and
tennis balls that last longer and work better. InMat achieves many of its suc-
cesses thanks to its Nanolok aqueous coatings (nanoparticles dispersed in
silicate and suspended in a polymer).
General Electric (www.geglobalresearch.com) is focused on material perfor-
mance. They are working on nanotubes and nanorods, nano-ceramics, nano-
structured metal alloys, and self-assembled block polymers. Given the breadth
of GE products (everything from ovens to aircraft engines and diagnostic-
imaging scanners), there are endless applications of improved material per-
formance for this electronics giant.
Other companies exploring how to make materials stronger with nanotech-
nology include
 Altair Nanotechnologies, Inc. (www.altairint.com)
 Celanese (www.celanese.com)
 Materials Modification, Inc. (www.matmod.com)
Making Nanotech Materials for Others
Several companies are producing the raw materials of nanotechnology for use
by others. Carbon Nanotechnologies Incorporation (www.cnanotech.com)
produces various grades of nanotubes, as well as sheets of graphite for use
by a variety of industries.
QuantumDot (www.qdots.com) does work in quantum dots, tiny crystals that
emit light of various colors. These are a big improvement over fluorescent
dyes traditionally used in cell research (which light up only briefly and tend
285
Chapter 12: Industries Going Small

to bleed into each other). Quantum dots are being used by various compa-
nies in genotyping (tagging the various genes in the genome with what is
essentially a color-coded bar code), analysis of white blood cells for HIV
patients, and even blood fingerprinting.
LG Electronics (www.lgelectronics.co.uk) makes a product called 
Nano Carbon Ball, a hollow sphere that they coat with a very thin layer of
nanoporous carbon. These balls soak up odors ten times better than other
carbon materials. The first use of this material is in a refrigerator used to 
ferment kimchi in Korean markets.

Designing for Small with Software
Coventor is a company that produces software products to help companies
develop products based on Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS), semi-
conductors, and microfluidics. They tout themselves as having an installed
base of users larger than those of their top ten competitors combined. Check
out their Web site (www.coventor.com) for a free software evaluation offer if
you want to experience their products firsthand.
Coventor developed (in a partnership with Zyvex) MEMulator — a software
program used for emulating and viewing nanotechnology processes. In addi-
tion, the aptly named CoventorWare, according to the company, performs 
the following futuristic magic: “enables schematic-based behavioral modeling
and detailed 3-D multi-physics numerical analysis.” Now, there’s a mouthful 
of fancy words — but they just mean that CoventorWare is a suite of programs
for producing MEMS designs; it can be used to create nanotechnology models,
simulate how these models work, and analyze the results.
Accelrys (www.accelrys.com) manufactures modeling and simulation soft-
ware for use in nanotechnology. Their software has been used to design drugs,
model modified polymers, and to try out ideas in the materials sciences. Their
products use quantum mechanics, molecular dynamics, and simulations to
predict properties, understand mechanisms, and interpret data such as mea-
surements in nanotubes.

Testing Things
Plenty of companies are making equipment for testing and manipulation of
nano-size materials. Good thing, too; making more and more stuff tinier and
tinier is probably a growth industry (so to speak).
Veeco Instruments (www.veeco.com) builds atomic force microscopes and
other testing equipment for research. Environmentally-controlled equipment
can test reactions of various sample materials in different environments.
Some of the scanners Veeco manufactures can be used for high-resolution
imaging of nano-size materials.
Zyvex builds a nano-manipulator system that mounts on a scanning electron
microscope (SEM) to assist in the testing of items such as nanotubes. Another
version of their manipulator is designed for use in the Life Sciences as a tool
for characterizing biological materials.
Obducat AB (www.obducat.com) is a Swedish company that makes nan-
otech tools, including scanning electron microscopes and nano-scale lith-

Technology That’s Changing
Telecommunications
Improving the alignment of fiber-optic connections is one of many ways to
apply nanotechnology to telecommunications. This improved accuracy
comes about by aligning the optical fibers — improving the medium via 
nano-manipulation — which will improve efficiency of transmission.
Bell Labs (www.bell-labs.com), a division of Lucent Technologies, sponsors
The New Jersey Nanotechnology Consortium (NJNC), partially supported by
the State of New Jersey and partnering with state universities such as Rutgers
and The New Jersey Institute of Technology. Bell Lab micro mirror technology
improves the modulation of beams used in projection optics. This could be
used to improve military and other communications.
Mobile telecommunications are also benefiting from nano. Agilent Tech-
nologies (www.agilent.com) is shipping a MEMS device that is helping 
cellphones get smaller. The MEMS device (called a duplexer) is about 
1/20th the size of the part it replaced. Knowles Acoustics (www.knowles
acoustics.com) is also tinkering with the use of nanotechnology in produc-
ing silicon microphones for cellphones.
Other companies pursuing nanotech advances in fiber optics are
 Corning (www.corning.com)
 Memscap (www.memsrus.com)
Fueling Energy with Nano
Among other things, the Palo Alto–based Nanosys (www.nanosysinc.com)
develops nanotechnology-enabled fuel cells used in portable electronics.
These fuel cells could power laptop computers, cellphones, or cameras, for
example.
In conjunction with companies such as Sharp Electronics, Nanosys is explor-
ing ways for higher-energy density fuel cells to overcome the limitations of
traditional batteries, making for longer energy life for portable electronics.
They are also working with the United States government on nanotechnology-
enabled solar-cell development. A privately held company, Nanosys doesn’t
stop with energy products. The company holds about 300 patents in nano-
technology, and has partnered with companies such as Intel and Dupont to
develop products in optical electronics, communications, and defense.

Konarka Technologies (http://konarka.com) produces solar panels with a
difference: Their light-activated “power plastic,” which contains titanium oxide
nanoparticles coated with a dye, is cheaper to produce and more lightweight
than solar panels. This material also uses more of the light spectrum than tra-
ditional solar cells so it can store energy from any light source, not just the sun.
But Konarka doesn’t stop at solar panels; they expect to use their “power plas-
tic” in applications such as cases for cellphones and laptops to save you the
trouble of plugging them into the wall to recharge their batteries.
Other companies energizing the world with nanotechnology are
 Hydrogen Solar (www.hydrogensolar.com)
 GEMZ Corporation (www.gemzcorp.net)
 Siemens (www.siemens.com)
 Chevron Texaco (www.chevrontexaco.com)
Making Up with Nanotechnology
Proctor & Gamble (www.pg.com) uses polymer and nanotechnology in cos-
metics. Using this approach, they can improve how make-up adheres to the
skin.
Several companies are producing sunscreen lotions based on mineral nano-
particles for better UV protection. Titanium oxide nanoparticles, for example,
provide good protection but don’t turn powdery white as the sunscreen dries,
as has traditionally been the case. L’Oreal (www.loreal.com) has produced an
anti-wrinkle cream that uses a polymer capsule to move active agents (such as
vitamins) into the skin.
Bionova (www.ibionova.com) is a company producing nano-skin technology
that supposedly mimics the human body’s use of bionutrients — chemicals
that assist in self-healing. Bionova uses short chain polypeptides and glyco-
proteins that they claim can reduce wrinkles. They produce a line of skin-care
products available to the general public. Interestingly, their discoveries came
out of their founder’s work with trauma patients and his observation of how
the human body can act to heal in times of physical trauma. Sometimes the
boundary between medicine and cosmetics can be pretty thin.
A few other companies exploring the use of nanotechnology in cosmetics are

 Scoping out nano in the U.S. laboratories
 Reviewing nano-activities by U.S. states and regions
 Discovering European nanotechnology initiatives
 Running down Asian nano-efforts

T
he governments of the world aren’t immune to nano-fever. Many coun-
tries understand the great potential value of nanotechnology in various
areas, including defense (think more powerful explosives and stronger and
lighter bulletproof vests, for example) and as an engine for economic growth.
The United States is definitely taking the lead, but Europe, Asia, and Israel are
also big players. This chapter gives you an overview of some of the govern-
ments with initiatives in nanotechnology, along with the key laboratories in
the United States.
Showing Nano-Initiative, 
U.S. Government Style
Nanotechnology isn’t a cheap business, so it makes sense that the richest
country in the world is taking it on in a big way. The United States is a hotbed
of nanotechnology activity as the U.S. government joins forces with industry

and academia to build expensive facilities and labs around the country and
get our workforce ready to move nanotech forward.
Two National Nanotechnology 
groups at work
Everybody knows that when the U.S. government works on anything, many
agencies are likely to jump into the fray — which can cause duplication and
confusion. Something called the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) is a
U.S. government program to coordinate nanotechnology efforts in the various
agencies. (You can check out their Web site at www.nano.gov.) A presidential-
appointed National Science and Technology Council runs the show at NNI.
The stated goals of the NNI are pretty lofty:
 Maintain a world-class research-and-development program aimed at real-
izing the full potential of nanotechnology.
 Facilitate transfer of new technologies into products for economic
growth, jobs, and other public benefit.
 Develop educational resources, a skilled workforce, and the supporting
infrastructure and tools necessary to advance nanotechnology.
 Support responsible development of nanotechnology.
NNI does several things. They fund various research projects and contribute
dollars to help create university and government nano-R&D labs. The organi-
zation also works to help promote the kind of educated workforce that we’ll
need to ensure that nanotechnology has a future.
Finally, this group encourages small-to-large businesses to jump on the nan-
otechnology bandwagon. In fact, a major goal of the NNI is to maximize the
return on federal dollars invested in nano-scale R&D. That’s why they empha-
size communicating with the business community on current research activi-
ties, partnership opportunities, and available resources. To that end, the NNI
is also a matchmaker of sorts, working behind the scenes to promote cross-
disciplinary networks and partnerships — all spreading the gospel of nano.
NNI, however, is not the only game in town. The National Science Board, an
advisory body of the National Science Foundation (NSF), has okayed funding
for the NNIN — the National Nanotechnology Infrastructure Network
(www.nnin.org), a joint venture combining the resources of 13 university
292
Part V: Investing in Nanotech 

programs. These schools will eventually make up an integrated, nationwide
system of user facilities. Together they’ll support research and education in
nano-scale science, engineering, and technology. Members of the National
Nanotechnology Infrastructure Network may also get access to government
facilities such as the DOE User Facilities and the Naval Research Laboratory’s
Institute of Nanoscience. We discuss NNIN in more detail in Chapter 14.
A whole host of government agencies
There are no less than 11 U.S. government agencies or departments with
research-and-development budgets for nanotechnology. Their budgets and
focuses vary, and logically relate to their core missions. For example, NASA 
is working on using nanomaterials to reduce the weight of spacecraft, while
the Environmental Protection Agency is funding studies into the use of nano-
materials to clean up pollution — as well as studies to evaluate the potential
hazards of nanomaterials themselves.
In case one of these initiatives catches your fancy and you want to learn
more about its latest efforts, here’s a list of the 11 sponsoring agencies, 
with their individual Web sites:
 National Science Foundation (www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/nano)
 National Institute of Standards and Technology (www.nist.gov/
public_affairs/nanotech.htm)
 NASA (www.ipt.arc.nasa.gov)
 Department of Energy (www.sc.doe.gov/bes/NNI.htm)
 Environmental Protection Agency (es.epa.gov/ncer/nano)
 Department of Defense (www.nanosra.nrl.navy.mil)
 National Institutes of Health (www.becon.nih.gov/nano.htm)
 National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (www.cdc.gov/
niosh/topics/nanotech)
 Department of Justice (www.usdoj.gov)
 Department of Homeland Security (www.dhs.gov/dhspublic)
 Agriculture Department (www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usdahome)
NASA and DOD have also funded nanotechnology research labs at various
universities. See Chapter 14 to discover more about which universities are
benefiting from this type of funding.

Chapter 13: Countries Investing In a Nano Future

Nano in the Lab
It’s always a good idea to repurpose the stuff you’ve already got in place, 
so (logically enough) labs all over the U.S. are being retrofitted to work with
nanotechnology. To that end, several Department of Energy national lab facili-
ties are being redesigned as we write to be leading lights for interdisciplinary
research on nanotech. In fact, these labs are the basis for a national initiative
to promote advances in science, new tools, and enhanced computing capabil-
ities. These new centers will support research at universities and in industry,
as well as at other government facilities.
Nanotechnology centers will be showing up at the following existing DOE labs:
 The Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences (CNMS) will be built at Oak
Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) (www.cnms.ornl.gov). The CNMS’s
three areas of focus will be in nano-dimensioned soft materials, complex
nanophase materials systems, and theory/modeling/simulation. The
CNMS is geared to take advantage of ORNL’s unique capabilities in neu-
tron scattering provided by their very impressive-sounding Spallation
Neutron Source and upgraded High Flux Isotope Reactor. This fancy
equipment can be used to determine the structure of nanomaterials and
to understand synthesis and self-assembly processes in some materials.
The CNMS will not be cramped: It’s set to be housed in an 80,000 square
foot lab and office building with an attached Nanofabrication Research
Laboratory.
 The Molecular Foundry will be built at Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory in Berkeley, California (foundry.lbl.gov). The facility will
take a look at the possible sharing of techniques and methods used to
fabricate nanoscale-patterned materials. The Foundry will allow scien-
tists from a whole slew of disciplines to perform research in its home in
a new laboratory building scheduled to be completed in 2006. The build-
ing will contain state-of-the-art instruments and a staff that’s savvy in the
newest techniques for using those instruments. Folks from academic,
government, and industrial laboratories can submit proposals to do
their work at The Molecular Foundry.
 The Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies (CINT) is being added to the
assets of Sandia National Laboratories (Albuquerque, New Mexico) and
Los Alamos National Laboratory (cint.lanl.gov) in 2005/2006. What’s
unique about CINT, according to their Web site, is their strong emphasis
on taking a close look at how you move from scientific discovery to actu-
ally using nanostructures in the real world. This involves experimenting
with ways to synthesize and process new materials, and how to inte-
grate these materials into structures and test their performance. The
plan is for CINT to bring together university faculty, students, laboratory
scientists from other national facilities, and corporate researchers to
study the integration of new nano-scale materials into unique architec-
tures and microsystems.
294
Part V: Investing in Nanotech 

 The Center for Functional Nanomaterials will be installed at Brookhaven
National Laboratory in Upton, New York (www.cfn.bnl.gov). The
Center is slated to provide cutting-edge resources for research on and
fabrication of nano-scale materials. Their emphasis will be on atomic-
level customizing of nanomaterials — tweaking specific properties to
perform specific functions. The Center should be completed in early
2007 and staffers will get to work by the spring of 2007.
 The Center for Nanoscale Materials will be set up at Argonne National
Laboratory in Argonne, Illinois (nano.anl.gov). This one is a joint effort
by the U.S. Department of Energy and the State of Illinois. The CNM will
support basic nanotech research and the development of high-end instru-
mentation. Argonne’s Advanced Photon Source (APS) will play an impor-
tant part. APS’s hard X-rays, applied in a nanoprobe beamline, provide 
a great way to determine the properties of extremely small structures.
Argonne has a history of outreach to academic and industrial communi-
ties, so they’re likely to help support regional and national goals and strate-
gic initiatives. The CNM also welcomes outside users from a wide variety 
of scientific fields. The hammers should fall silent on this building project
around mid-2006 — and operations should begin by the end of that year.

Getting Money for Research
Are you ready to apply for a grant to come up
with the next great nano-product? Then remem-
ber where the federal research money comes
from: grants given by individual government
departments and agencies in line with their
individual missions. Study up on those missions
and hone your message accordingly. You’ll find
more info on the Current Solicitations page of
the National Nanotechnology Initiative Web site
(nano.gov/html/funding/currentsol.
html). This particular page offers links to the
funding home pages for the departments and
agencies involved in the National Nano-
technology Initiative (NNI). There’s also a solic-
itation database (lmisgreen.lanl.gov/
programs) offered by the Department of
Energy Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies.
Here you can read all about opportunities for
federal funding for nanotechnology research.
But it doesn’t stop at grants; there are special
programs just to seed commercial activities 
in nano to stimulate economic growth. These
programs push small-business collaboration
with universities and other research groups. A
page on the National Nanotechnology Initiative
Web site (nano.gov/html/funding/SBIR_
STTRbusinessops.html) gives you an
overview of these federal government pro-
grams. The two largest programs are called
Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and
Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR).
If you need help finding your funding, try Tech-Net
(tech-net.sba.gov/), sponsored by the U.S.
Small Business Administration. This Internet-
based database includes lists of awards from
Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR), Small
Business Technology Transfer (STTR), and
Advanced Technology Program (ATP). It also
includes information on Manufacturing Extension
Partners (MEP) centers. If you’re looking for a
small-business partner, small-business contrac-
tors and subcontractors, research partners, or
even investment opportunities, check this one out.

U.S. State and Regional Initiatives
Several states have seen the future, and its name is nano. The amount of
resources individual states can devote to bringing us a step closer to this
future varies widely, however. For example, one state has fully funded several
Nanotechnology Centers of Excellence, while other states have only indicated
support of collaboration between universities and corporations within their
borders, with little actual funding going on.
One of the big players is the state of New York. Along with some industrial
partners, New York committed over $1.4 billion to establish five Centers of
Excellence in nanoelectronics, photonics, bioinformatics, information tech-
nology, and environmental systems. The combination of the resources of
these centers offers a powerful nanotechnology commercialization effort.
As if that weren’t enough, New York has also committed over $120 million to
build eight Strategically Targeted Academic Research (STAR) Centers and 
five Advanced Research Centers (ARC). These will not only support research
efforts, but also attract some high-powered faculty to New York–based univer-
sities. New York is also providing $30 million for activities at 15 Centers for
Advanced Technology (CAT) and Regional Technology Development Councils
(RTDC) — as well as providing venture capital funding to the tune of $400 mil-
lion. (If you live in New York, now you know where those tax dollars are going!)
The Massachusetts Nanotechnology Initiative is a pet project of the Mass-
achusetts Technology Collaborative (MTC) (www.mtpc.org). The goal 
of MTC is to encourage research, new ventures, and new jobs for the
Commonwealth. MTC also runs the John Adams Innovation Institute that
aims to foster strategic investments that support Massachusetts’s knowl-
edge-based economy. For example, the Institute gave a $5 million award to
the Center of Excellence in Nanomanufacturing at UMass Lowell. The Center
will focus on successful commercialization of nanotechnology, including the
challenge of creating the highly trained workforce the discipline demands.
Up in the mountains, the Colorado Nanotech Initiative (www.coloradonano.
org) (Colorado Nanotech) is Colorado’s nanotechnological arm. Colorado
Nanotech fosters opportunities, supports education, increases public aware-
ness, and acts as a general clearinghouse for nanotechnological information
and resources around the state and the region.
The Texas Nanotechnology Initiative (www.texasnano.org) naturally thinks
big, and so wants to establish Texas as a world leader in the field. They 
have pulled together a consortium of Texas-based universities, industries,
investors, and government representatives to support communication, 
collaboration, and the sharing of nanotech resources.
296

California won’t be left behind. The Northern California Nanotechnology
Initiative (NCNano) (www.ncnano.org) is a regional economic development
program. They are working to build what they call a Nanotechnology Cluster
in northern California. They have big dreams, saying they’ll bring $6 billion in
nanotechnology investment and grants into the area, and create 150,000 new
local jobs to boot. NCNano hopes to light a nano-fire to inspire the integra-
tion of universities, research labs, businesses, and others in the nanotech
effort.
The Initiative for Nanotechnology in Virginia (www.InanoVA.org) is another
state-sponsored consortium of universities, federal labs, state agencies, and
industrial partners. This group promotes research collaboration, workforce
growth, technology transfer, and nanotechnology commercialization.
Virginia’s Center for Innovative Technology (CIT) provided seed money to
start the group, along with matching funds put up by partner institutions and
corporations.
Minnesota is looking at building a research center at the University of
Minnesota to be called OMNI, the Organization for Minnesota Nanotechnology
Initiatives (www.nano.umn.edu/omni). OMNI will support research activities
in four main categories: nano-scale manipulation and self-assembly; nano-scale
characterization and analysis; nano-materials; and nano-devices.
As you might expect, in Pennsylvania, Ben Franklin is leading the charge (Ben
Franklin Technology Partners of Southeastern Pennsylvania, that is). This
group, along with Drexel University and the University of Pennsylvania, has
created NTI, the Nanotechnology Institute (www.nanotechinstitute.org).
The NTI’s mission is to support “the transfer of discoveries and intellectual
knowledge in the area of nanotechnology from universities to industry part-
ners” and to work on “the rapid application and commercialization of this
technology to stimulate economic growth.”
The linchpin of the New Jersey Nanotechnology Consortium (NJNC at www.
njnano.org) is the world-famous Bell Labs nanofabrication laboratory in
Murray Hill. This lab offers cutting-edge fabrication capabilities. Joining
forces with some top-flight regional academic research institutions and uni-
versities (think Princeton, think Rutgers), NJNC has a heady goal: developing
the capability to move those exotic nanotechnology ideas from concept to
commercialization.
The Connecticut Nanotechnology Initiative (www.ctnano.org) (CNI) is
another collaborative effort among industries, universities, and government
agencies. Their focus is, naturally, on establishing Connecticut as a leader in
nano research, development, and commercialization.
Finally, to prove that too many chefs don’t spoil the nano-stew, the
Nanotechnology Institute (www.nanotechinstitute.org) is a multistate 
initiative involving academic and research institutions, corporate partners,
private investors, as well as government types interested in supporting

economic development. The states participating include New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Delaware — including some international
alliances with Japan, Italy, and the United Kingdom thrown in for good 
measure.
Euro Nano
The trend these days is for Europe to see itself as one big community, whether
it involves currency, sports, or technology. As a result, there are a few key
Euro-wide organizations driving nanotechnology efforts. Many initiatives seem
to still be in the planning stages, but Europe is definitely beginning to get its
act together regarding nanotechnology.
The European Commission
The European Union met in March 2000 and called for a better use of
European resources and research for technology. They charged the European
Commission, an administrative body, with creating a market for science and
technology within a disciplinary division called the European Research Area
(ERA). A budget program — referred to as a Framework Programme (in this
case, FP6) — put aside funds to make this ERA a reality. (FP6 is budgeted to
run from 2002to 2006, and it contains a strong focus on nanotechnology.)
If you go to the Community Research & Development Information Service
Web site at www.cordis.lu/nanotechnology, you’ll get an overview of 
nanotechnology-related activities across Europe. The site offers information
on projects and funding opportunities, as well as information about the
European Research Area and the FP6, the sixth Framework Programme.
Goals of the European Commission include research into a range of ambitious
nanotech topics:
 understanding phenomena, mastering processes, and developing
research tools
 nanobiotechnologies 
 engineering techniques
 handling materials and developing control devices
 applications
 development of fundamental knowledge
298
Part V: Investing in Nanotech 

 technologies for production, transformation, and processing
 engineering support for materials development
 new processes and flexible and intelligent manufacturing systems
The budget allocated for the duration of FP6 is 1.3 billion euros. This budget
covers certain technology platforms. The Nanobiotechnologies for Medical
Applications, for example, is a technology platform of the ERA that is cur-
rently under development with a focus in the medical area. The European
Nanoelectronics Initiative Advisory Council (ENIAC— no, it’s not the same 
as that early IBM mainframe) is the European technology platform for nano-
electronics, and so on.
To give you an idea of the focus of individual platforms, the stated principal
mission of ENIAC (www.cordis.lu/ist/eniac) is to tackle a range of goals:
 Provide a strategic research agenda for the nanoelectronics sector, with
respect to R&D.
 Set out strategies and roadmaps to achieve this vision through the
Strategic Research Agenda and other associated documents.
 Stimulate increased and more effective and coherent public and private
investment in R&D in the nanoelectronics sector.
 Contribute to improving convergence between EC, national, regional,
and private R&D actions on nanoelectronics within the European
Research Area Framework.
 Enhance networking and clustering of the R&D capacity in Europe.
 Promote European commitment to R&D, ensuring Europe’s place as an
attractive location for researchers.
 Interact with policymakers and other influential people at all levels of
society that influence the competitiveness of the sector — such as edu-
cation and training, competition, finance and investment, and so on.
Keeping folks informed: 
The Thematic Network
The European Union has also sponsored the Thematic Network (www.cordis.
lu/nmp/national-research.htm) to provide a one-stop source of informa-
tion for all areas of nanotechnology to business, scientific researchers, and
communities. A dedicated Web site (www.nanoforum.org) is under develop-
ment — one that will bring together partners from different disciplines as well
as national and regional networks. The idea here is to share best practices in
order to stimulate nanotechnology initiatives in less-developed European coun-
tries such as Bosnia-Herzegovina and Hungary, encourage young scientists,
and spread knowledge and expertise.
299
Chapter 13: Countries Investing In a Nano Future

EU ministers emphasize the potential of nanosciences and nanotechnologies
to spur development in key areas such as healthcare, information technolo-
gies, materials sciences, manufacturing, instrumentation, energy, environ-
ment, security, and aerospace. These ambitious folks are looking seriously at
nano as a significant booster for quality of life, sustainable development, and
economic competitiveness.
Bottom line: Europe still seems to be feeling its way in the nano-realm, 
defining goals, potential programs, and synergies. But keep an eye on the
Europeans in the next few years: Their combined energy could make them
bigger players in years to come.
Jumping on the Bandwagon: Asia
The United States and Europe are certainly not the only players in nanotech-
nology. So what’s going on in Asian countries? Read on and you’ll find out.
Nano in Japan
Nano can make for strange bedfellows, at least from a Western point of view.
Japan has given two of its ministries the job of overseeing nanotech research.
The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (Sports?
Yep.) joins forces with the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry to over-
see nanotechnology research. The funding support system is a little compli-
cated, placing two ministers in charge of science and technology.
Japan has a number of different science and technology agendas. They want
to promote basic research and development in areas that meet society’s
needs — the life sciences, for example — as well as information and commu-
nications technology, and environmental sciences. Another priority is to sup-
port emerging research areas that could have unforeseen benefits.
Development of Japanese nanotechnology as it relates to commercial prod-
ucts probably won’t be handled quite the same way as in the United States.
Japanese efforts in the nanoelectronic devices area will undoubtedly be 
controlled by technology giants such as NEC, Hitachi, Fujitsu, and Toshiba,
whereas pharmaceutical companies will steer development on the bio-
technology side. Japan doesn’t currently support nanotechnology with 
venture-capital dollars, or offer opportunities for small start-ups. Small 
and medium-size companies may be left behind in the nanotechnology 
rush, at least in the beginning.

Some key players in Japanese nanotechnology include these:
 The Council for Scientific and Technological Policy (www8.cao.go.jp/
cstp/english/s&tmain-e.html)
 The National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology
(www.aist.go.jp/index.en.html)
 The Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (www.riken.go.jp/
engn)
 The National Institute for Materials Science (www.nims.go.jp/eng)
Japanese universities are not being left out of the mix. Tokyo University, the
Tokyo Institute of Technology, Osaka University, and Kyoto University, to
name a few, are heavily involved in nanotechnology research.
China goes nano
The National Center for Nano Science and Technology (NCNST, as if you
really need another acronym at this point) is one of the centers that has
received substantial funding from the Chinese government. The National
Engineering Research Center for Nanotechnology (NERCN) is another organi-
zation favored by Chinese government funding. NERCN borrowed talent from
the U.S. in the form of Director Dr. Jie Han, a Chinese-American who was the
technical director and manager of NASA’s Ames Center for Nanotechnology.
Dr. Han also serves as the CEO of the Shanghai National Engineering Research
Center for Nanotechnology (SNERC), so this man’s plate is very full. The
Chinese government has given about 24 million in U.S. dollars to the SNERC.
Current projects that the NERCN and SNERC are working on include:
 Mass production of nano-diamond coating materials, carbon nanotubes,
and nanowires.
 Nanosensor network systems used for security monitoring.
 Nanomaterials for environmental protection and healthcare.
 Chemical and biosensor systems for disease diagnosis.
Other nanotechnology centers in China include the CAS Nanotechnology
Research Center, Nanomaterials and Development Application Center, and
the Surface Science, Nanotechnology and Engineering Center.

Nano inside India
In 2001, India launched their National Nanoscience and Technology Initiative
(NSTI), about the same time as other Asian countries. The program includes
three major areas:
 Research, including synthesis and assembly, characterization of proper-
ties, and applications.
 Education, supporting advanced schools, symposia, and training work-
shops for researchers and scholars.
 Industry, emphasizing interaction with industries in a variety of areas,
such as nanoelectronics, nanopower/particle production, and surface
coatings.
India is building several labs with fancy microscopes and other equipment to
analyze and characterize nanomaterials. The main nanotech institutions in
India that the NSTI supports are
 Indian Institute of Science, www.iisc.ernet.in
 Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research, www.
jncasr.ac.in
 National Chemical Laboratory, www.ncl-india.org
 National Physical Laboratory, www.nplindia.org/npl
 Indian Association of Nuclear Physics, www.iacs.res.in
 Indiana Institute of Technology, www.iitd.ernet.in
Current research involves applying carbon nanotubes in measuring fluid flow,
synthesizing and controlling the properties of nanotubes, using biosynthesis
to produce nanomaterials, fine-tuning the biophysics of gene regulation, and
looking into manufacturing possibilities such as nanolithography and tem-
plates for synthesizing nanowires. (Can’t imagine when these guys ever get 
a break for lunch.).
There has also been a lot of international collaboration going on with India.
Their Center for Nanomaterials, for example, was established in partnership
with groups in Russia, the Ukraine, Japan, Germany, and the United States.
Nano Is Going Over Big Time in Israel
The Israeli government set up the Israeli National Nanotechnology Initiative
(INNI) (www.nanotrust.org.il/inni.asp). Their mission is to make nan-
otechnology the next big thing in industry by leading the way with a variety
of initiatives.
302
Part V: Investing in Nanotech 

The first step for INNI is to launch partnerships among government, acade-
mia, and industry that will allow Israel to step up to the plate in the broader
world of nanotechnology. To get there, the INNI has set itself some vigorous
goals:
 Establish a national policy of resource allocation in nanotechnology 
for optimization of the use of resources and faster realization of market
viability.
 Formulate a long-range nanotechnology program for research and tech-
nology development in academia and industry, and promote the estab-
lishment in Israel of a world-class infrastructure to support it.
 Actively seek resources from public as well as from private sources to
fund research, technology projects, and infrastructure projects.
 Lead the selection of the projects per agreed national priorities, allocate
the budgets, and review progress on approved projects.
 Promote the establishment of local nanotechnology-based industry,
which will make an impact on the economic growth of Israel and benefit
the investors.
The Israel Nanotechnology Trust (www.nanotrust.org.il), known as the
INT, is the part of the Israeli National Nanotechnology Initiative (INNI) that
raises and distributes money.
Another group active in Israel is the Consortium for Nano Functional Materials
(NFM). This organization consists of participants from 14 industries and 12 aca-
demic research groups. NFM members are performing basic R&D in the field of
nano-materials and technologies. The NFM seeks to expand their activities by
working with groups from around the world.
The INNI has stated that to gain a leadership role, Israel has to invest at least
$300 million in research and development over five years. They’ve made a
good start: Their current total investment is around $150 million.
To search out this kind of funding, the Israeli Nanotechnology Trust is looking
at a variety of sources, including Jewish organizations. Traditionally, money
from Jewish groups goes toward supporting immigration to Israel, helping 
to develop agriculture, and building up military strength. The message they
present to Jewish donors is that an emphasis on funding science and tech-
nology — especially nanotechnology — is the way to jumpstart Israel’s future.
Can a smaller country such as Israel hope to compete in the nanotechnology
arena? Probably not. Smaller countries don’t have a prayer of mustering the
spending power of the United States, the European Union, and Japan. Still,
they may have a shot at becoming leaders in applications of nano that focus
on solving their particular problems, such as water and energy shortages.
303
Chapter 13: Countries Investing In a Nano Future

No wonder Israel is applying nanotechnology to areas of clear practical
importance to national survival. For example, water desalination, energy,
biotechnology, and semiconductors all have a strong social and/or economic
focus in Israel.
Bottom line: As the components of technology get smaller and smaller, world-
wide interest in developing them gets bigger and bigger.

Nanotechnology Goes to School
In This Chapter
 Looking at schools that are into nanotechnology in a big way
 Understanding some of the ties of industry and government to academia
 Exploring educational opportunities in nanotechnology
 Discovering a handful of other academic hotbeds of nano in the U.S. and elsewhere
N
anotechnology is still largely in a research phase — and a great deal 
of that is being done on university campuses. Because a lot of this
research work requires some big bucks — not in big supply on many cam-
puses today — much of this work goes on in conjunction with business 
and governments.
In September of 2001 (for example), the U.S. government selected six schools
as Centers of Excellence in Nanotechnology. (These are included in the upcom-
ing list, along with a few others.) The National Science Foundation has several
partnerships with academia (several of which we mention here). But more than
a hundred schools now have nanotechnology research underway — and that’s
just in the United States. Japan, China, and Israel (to name a few) are also
active.
In this chapter, we pinpoint several universities going small in a big way.
Harvard . . . of course
One of the designated Centers of Excellence in Nanotechnology, Harvard is
no slacker when it comes to all things small.
Harvard’s Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (www.mrsec.
harvard.edu) brings together 21 faculty members from the departments of
engineering, physics, biology, chemistry, and even Harvard Medical School.

The three main research groups are in hot pursuit of distinct projects:
 Multiscale mechanics of films and interfaces. In plain English, these
folks are looking at the behavior of thin films.
 Engineering materials and techniques for biological studies at cellular
scales. This group is studying the structure and properties of the materi-
als that compose biological cells.
 Interface-mediated assembly of soft materials. This research involves
controlling various aspects of self-assembly processes.
The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center sponsors an indus-
trial internship that allows students involved in nanotechnology research to
work hand in hand with industry researchers.
Individual departments at Harvard are also immersed in nanotech research 
in areas such as computer devices, chemistry, nano-size switches and wires,
and molecular imaging. Harvard Business School, not to be left behind, even
explored investment opportunities for nanotechnology at their Annual
Principal Investment Conference in 2005.
Small as Rice
Rice University in Texas is home to (among others) Richard Smalley, Nobel
Laureate in Chemistry with an impressive reputation in nanotechnology
research. Smalley heads up The Smalley Group at Rice.
The Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology at Rice (cnst.rice.edu/
whatshot.cfm) involves 14 academic departments, ranging from Earth
Science to the Jones School of Management to Chemistry and even to
Religious Studies.
The Center focuses on three areas: wet, dry, and computational nanotechnol-
ogy. Here’s how these break down:
 Wet nanotechnology is the study of biological systems that live in the
water. This is the area where genetics, enzymes, and various cellular
components are studied.
 Dry nanotechnology relates to surface chemistry and materials fabrica-
tion, including the study of nanotubes, silicon, and other inorganic mate-
rials. Dry nanotechnology can involve metals and semiconductors
(which its “wetter” cousin can’t).
 A computational focus involves modeling and simulation of very compli-
cated nanometer-scale structures. The study of nano-computation can
have a huge impact on the evolution of both its wet and dry brethren.
306
Part V: Investing in Nanotech 

Rice often works with Texas-based NASA on projects involving SWNT (single-
walled nanotubes) and sci-fi-sounding stuff like pulsed-laser vaporization (a
process used to produce SWNTs).
Small Things in the Big Apple: Columbia
The Center for Nanostructured Materials at Columbia University (research.
radlab.columbia.edu/mrsec) was established by a National Science
Foundation grant way back in 1998. Their work involves teams of academics,
people from industry, and laboratory scientists developing complex metal-
oxide nanocrystals into thin films that can be used to improve the strength 
of materials. The center is also looking into structurally integrated chemical
films that contain nanoparticles.
There’s a lot of educational outreach from this school, including a summer
program for undergraduates who want to explore nanotechnology research.
They also sponsor a program for K-through-12 science teachers in the New
York City area. Finally, the folks at Columbia have created a resource-sharing
program called Instrumentation User Facilities to make certain difficult-to-
find (and hard-to-afford) equipment available to others for nanotechnology
research.
Columbia also received an initial U.S. government grant of $10.8 million to
fund the work of 16 researchers for five years in their Center for Electronic
Transport in Molecular Nanostructures. Professors Ronald Breslow (who 
won a National Medal of Science) and Horst Stormer (a Nobel Prize winner 
in physics) lead the center.
Visit the nanoportal at Columbia at www.cise.columbia.edu/nano/ to find
out all that’s going on there.
“And Perhaps Cornell?”
Cornell was named as 1 of 13 members of the National Nanotechnology
Infrastructure Network (www.nnin.org/), a national nanotechnology labora-
tory network, in December 2003. This consortium was funded to the tune of
about $70 million over five years, beginning in January of 2004. Figure 14-1
provides a map that shows the locations of all 13 member schools.
Folks at Cornell focus on materials science and engineering research, includ-
ing nanostructured materials in electronic and mechanical devices.
307
Chapter 14: Nanotechnology Goes to School

The Applied Physics faculty at Cornell are busy researching a variety of nano-
related topics, including
 The dynamic mechanical properties of nano-scale materials
 Growth mechanisms of nanomaterials
 Properties of nanocomposites
 Nano-scale electronic and magnetic phenomena
 Development of nano-scale devices
 Thin films
 Development of applications for light-emitting nanoparticles called 
CU dots — not to be confused with quantum dots (which we discuss in
Chapter 8), each of these contains a core of fluorescent dyes inside a
glass shell
 Self-assembly at the molecular level
Under the direction of Professor Bruce Lewenstein, Cornell’s Department of
Communication has even teamed up with their Science & Technology Studies
department to investigate the social and ethical issues posed by nanotech-
nology. (Visit www.people.cornell.edu/pages/bvl1/NanoSEI.htm to read

Nano House on the Prairie: 
Northwestern University
Northwestern’s Institute for Nanotechnology (www.nanotechnology.north
western.edu/) is a kind of umbrella group for administering multimillions
in nanotechnology research dollars.
One of the investments recently at Northwestern was to build a 40,000-
square-foot Center for Nanofabrication and Molecular Self-Assembly on its
Evanston campus. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services funded
it (to the tune of $14 million), which makes it one of the first federally funded
facilities dedicated to nano.
Other initiatives at Northwestern include these:
 Nanoscale Science & Engineering Center for Integrated Nanopatterning
and Detection Technologies. This is one of seven Nanoscale Science and
Engineering Centers (NSEC) funded by the National Science foundation
at various universities. You can find a listing of all the NSECs at www.
nano.gov/html/centers/nnicenters.html.
 Nanoscale Interdisciplinary Research Team for Multiscale Modeling and
Catalysts for Green Chemistry and Engineering (try fitting that on your
educational resume).
 NIAID Specific Detection of HIV Targets by Gold Nanoparticle Probes.
 Center for Transportation Nanotechnology.
Northwestern faculty have laurels but certainly aren’t sitting on them. John
Pople won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1998, Chad Mirkin pioneered dip
pen lithography (a new method of “writing” at the molecular-scale), and
Richard Van Duyne is an Alfred P. Sloan fellow in Chemistry who has won
numerous awards in the area of the dynamics of surface processes.

Small Progress at Rennsselaer
In Troy, New York, plucky little RPI (Rennsselaer Polytechnic Institute) has
established a nanotechnology center that is hard at work on research and
education initiatives. Here they study advanced coatings for materials, the
nano dimension of biosciences and biotechnology, and nanoelectronics, as
well as nano-scale mechanics and systems.
RPI hosts the Nanoscale Science and Engineering Center for Directed Assembly
of Nanostructures (www.rpi.edu/dept/nsec/about_us.html) along with the
University of Illinois and Los Alamos National Laboratory. (The Center’s Web
site is pictured in Figure 14-2.) Established in 2001 by the National Science
Foundation, the effort is housed in the Rennsselaer Nanotechnology Center.
The Center is focusing on two areas; the assembly of nano-sized materials into
gels and polymer nanocomposites, and nanostructured biomolecule composite
architectures. (Nanocomposites might be used in, for example, stain-resistant
fabrics or to create stronger plastic bags.)
The RPI-Industry Partnership in Nanotechnology provides support for 
industry-related research with companies such as Eastman Kodak (in
Rochester, New York) and IBM (in Poughkeepsie, New York), as well as 
more distant partners like Philip Morris (in Richmond, Virginia).

Ben Gurion University and Nano
Israel is a hotbed of nanotechnology, where researchers have developed the
ability to produce large quantities of metal nanopowders for use in industry
(far exceeding the rate at which the U.S. can produce them). Ben Gurion
University is one group leading the way in Israeli academia.
Search the Ben Gurion University Web site (www.bgu.ac.il/) and you get
hundreds of listings of courses and articles related to nanotechnology. This
school has a $100 million center for nanotechnology, so you know they have
definitely caught the religion of small.
The people at Ben Gurion are working on everything from carbon nanotubes
to thin films to DNA manipulation to polymer matrices to quantum dots. They
are a part of the Nano-Functional Materials Consortium, comprising 14 com-
panies and 12 academic research organizations in Israel and working on the
use of nanotechnology in manufacturing processes.
Check out the Ilse Katz Center for Meso and Nanoscale Science and Technology
at www.bgu.ac.il/nanocenter/index.html for a list of labs run by specific
professors as well as a rundown of various activities and events related to nan-
otechnology.
Technion, The Israel Institute of Technology (www.technion.ac.il) is at
once the oldest institute of technology in Israel, started in the 1920s, and 
one of the most cutting edge. They are very active in the nanotechnology
research area and will open the Sara and Moshe Zisapel Nanoelectronic
Center (www.ee.technion.ac.il/Labs/Nano/) in 2005.
Made in Japan: University of Tokyo
Japan is where nanotubes were first discovered, so don’t be surprised if
other advances come from this small — but technologically advanced —
country. The Quantum-Phase Electronics Center at the School of Engineering,
University of Tokyo (www.qpec.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/) is looking into the elec-
tronic properties of SWNTs (single-walled nanotubes) in a big way. They were
founded in 2001 to study the relationship of quantum physics to engineering.
The center takes its name from its study of materials — such as nanotubes —
in which electrons are in a “quantum-phase” (that is, are ruled by the laws of
quantum mechanics). The center seeks to combine the necessary resources in
science and engineering to develop a new electronic based on such materials
and devices. Their goals include ultrafast optical switching, high-temperature
superconductors, and the controlled use of electron orbitals (required for
molecular electronics).

California (Nano) Dreaming at Berkeley
With its traditional tie-ins with some pretty famous research labs such as
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Berkeley is a natural front-and-
center location for such a research-intensive field such as nanotechnology.
The Berkeley Nanotechnology Forum, held in April 2005, is just one effort 
of this group to lead the way into the nano-realm.
The Nanotechnology Initiative Research Group at Berkeley (www.me.
berkeley.edu/nti/home.html) is a part of the Department of Mechanical
Engineering that deals with nano-scale engineering, nanocomposites, and
nanowires, among other weighty topics.
As an example of the type of people who pursue nanotechnology at Berkeley,
the Chair of the department, Professor Albert Pisano, also happens to be
head of The Nanotechnology Steering Committee of the American Society of
Mechanical Engineers. He’s a big fish in the nanotech pond, having served as
the Program Manager for MEMS for the Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency (DARPA). A researcher in the chemistry department, Paul Alivisatos,
was the founding editor of Nano Letters, a scientific journal devoted to nan-
otech research. (He’s also scientific founder of Nanosys Inc., a startup spe-
cializing in nanomaterials.) Alivisatos is currently the director of Berkeley
Lab’s Molecular Foundry, one of five Department of Energy research centers.
Other departments at Berkeley active in nanotechnology include the Physics
Department — busily studying vibration requirements for environments
where nano devices are being manufactured — and Electronic Engineering —
bent on exploring nanotechnology uses in the semiconductor industry.
Visit nano.berkeley.edu for more about what’s going on at Berkeley, includ-
ing their leadership role in COINS (The Center of Integrated Nanomechanical
Systems).

Women in Nanotechnology
Though many of the people teaching and
researching in nanotechnology today are men,
women are also active in the field. A case in point
is Angela Belcher, an MIT materials scientist and
winner of a 2004 MacArthur Fellowship (some-
times referred to as a “genius grant”). In addition
to her work at MIT, she has founded a company
called Cambrios Technology, which does work in
microchip fabrication and other areas. Con-
cerned with spreading nanotech knowledge, she
has worked with local schools to make her labo-
ratory at MIT available to help educate others. If
you or somebody you know is interested in study-
ing nanotechnology, rest assured there is oppor-
tunity there for everyone!

Nanotechnology is the art and science of building stuff that does stuff at the

— Richard Smalley
W
e couldn’t have said it any better ourselves.
Nanotechnology has developed its fair share of notable overachievers —
folks who are creatively exploring (and staking claim to) the uncharted terri-
tory of the nano scale. In this chapter, we’re going to highlight a few such
notables. This list of movers and shakers comprises scientists and business
leaders — and even scientists who are business leaders. Although this list
exceeds its quota (sixteen!), it’s certainly not complete; it continues to
evolve.
And the winners are . . . in no particular order . . .
Richard Smalley
Richard Smalley is a professor at Rice University, situated in the Great State
of Texas (Houston, Texas, to be more precise). In 1985, Smalley, along with
Robert Curl and Sir Harold Kroto, discovered C60, the buckminsterfullerene
(also known affectionately as the buckyball) — in effect, the key to the 

molecular structures most readily used in nanotechnology. As a result, all
three shared the Nobel Prize in 1996 in chemistry.
Professor Smalley has spent the last 20 years or so busily promoting nanotech-
nology in general, as well as perfecting production methods of another form of
fullerene, the carbon nanotube — “a gift from Mother Nature,” as he describes
it. In 2000, he founded Carbon Nanotechnologies Inc. (CNI), a start-up com-
pany devoted to large-scale production of single-walled carbon nanotubes. A
staunch advocate of nanotechnology, Smalley testified before congress in 1999
in support of what later became the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI).
In addition, he has promoted an energy overhaul on a scale as big as the Apollo
space program, utilizing carbon nanotube fibers for efficient energy distribu-
tion. He encourages young students to seek careers in the sciences with his
straight-ahead mission statement: “Be a Scientist, Save the World.”
Charles Lieber
A Harvard University professor, Charles Lieber has pioneered the synthesis,
characterization, and development of nano-scale wires. He has continued to
demonstrate applications of these nanowires in nanocomputing, nanoelec-
tronics, nanophotonics, and biological and chemical sensing. Capitalizing on
these breakthroughs in nanomaterials, he founded a nanotechnology com-
pany — Nanosys, Inc. — in 2001. Its goal was to develop a “google” of patents
(over 350 completed patents and patent-pending applications). These would
include flexible electronics (think circuit boards on thin sheets of plastic),
solar cells, fuel cells, and nonvolatile computer memory. Not only is Lieber
making nanotech materials and applications, he has also developed a new,
chemically sensitive microscope for probing organic and biological material
at the nano scale.
Hongjie Dai
Stanford University associate professor Hongjie Dai has taken carbon nan-
otubes to new heights — or (perhaps more appropriately) depths — of nano-
sophistication. After his stint at Rice University, where he worked with
Richard Smalley, he has continued to study the suitability of carbon nan-
otubes for future miniaturized devices. No easy task. For openers, he not only
has to achieve precision operations despite the small size of the carbon nan-
otubes, but also decipher their unique quantum effects. As it happens, Dai’s
team is making progress with two applications that will improve nanotech
itself. They’re using nanotubes as chemical sensors and as tips for atomic-
force microscopes — both of which give nanoscientists unprecedented reso-
lution and sensitivity to see what they’re doing down there.
320
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

James Heath
California Institute of Technology professor James Heath started his nano-
technology trek back in 1985; as a graduate student, he ran the experimental
apparatus in the work that led to Richard Smalley’s discovery of C60 at Rice
University. He has the happy knack of getting his experiments to work — and is
described as a brilliant experimental scientist by his peers. After a brief stint at
IBM’s T. J. Watson Research Labs, he moved on to the University of California at
Los Angeles, where he pioneered the molecular switch, using nanowires and
molecules. Additionally, he developed a scanning optical microscope used in
noninvasive probing of the electrical functions of living cells — in effect, poking
and prodding cells to image them without hurting them. Now, at Caltech, he is
combining his knowledge of molecules, nanowires, and biology to come up
with a single cell-sensing device (that is, a lab-on-a-chip) in conjunction with
Stephen Quake, a Stanford University microfluidics expert.
His hard work has not gone unnoticed. Among many awards, he’s won the
Feynman Price in Nanotechnology in 2000, and was even seen alongside
Bruce Springsteen in Vanity Fair magazine’s Hall of Fame in 1999 — maybe
that means nanotech was born to run.
James Von Ehr II
James Von Ehr is the founder, chairman, and CEO of Zyvex Corporation, a
nanotech company specializing in nano-size manipulators — tools that allow
scientists to manipulate nano-size structures under a microscope. Before
founding Zyvex, Von Ehr was founder, president, chairman, and CEO of Altsys
Corporation, the company that developed the first PostScript drawing pro-
gram. Altsys was sold in 1995 to Macromedia (the company that unleashed
Flash animation on all us unsuspecting visitors to Web sites across the
Internet). Clearly this shows that Von Ehr has a knack for commercializing
technology — but more importantly this (major) sale brought in enough
major bucks to start a nanotech company — which is inevitably a huge
investment.
Along with running Zyvex since 1997, he is a founder of the Texas Nano-
technology Initiative and is on the Board of Directors for the NanoBusiness
Alliance. In 2003, Von Ehr testified before the Senate to promote the 21st
Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act, which was signed
into law later that year.
321
Chapter 15: Ten (Or So) Nanotech Movers and Shakers

George Whitesides
George Whitesides is a chemistry professor at Harvard and a member of the
Nanotechnology Technical Advisory Group — a U.S. government advisory
committee. His research has influenced (and continues to influence) material
science, surface science, microfluidics, self-assembly, and of course, nan-
otechnology. His main focus has been surface chemistry — particularly 
that of organic surfaces — nonmetal surfaces such as skin, wood, or fabric.
Organic surfaces are highly disordered, making their interfaces with other
surfaces difficult to study because collecting information is tricky. Whitesides
pioneered an unusual approach that used self-assembled monolayers (SAMs)
to show ordered organic surfaces. This made it possible to design surfaces at
the molecular scale — and (an added bonus here) it’s a very flexible technol-
ogy. Lots of variations are possible. Another claim to fame for Whitesides is
his development of soft lithography, a process for molding and printing micro-
and nano-structures. This technique makes possible smaller electronics and
microfluidics (lab-on-a-chip components).
Paul Alivisatos
Paul Alivisatos is a chemistry professor at the University of California,
Berkeley, as well as a researcher at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
His real claim to fame lies in his work with semiconducting nanocrystals.
These nanocrystals come in different shapes and sizes — quantum dots,
nanorods, tetrapods, and other such exotic creations. The quantum-dot con-
nection led him to help launch Quantum Dot Corp. in 1998 with their first
product, Qdots (available in 2002 for use in bio-labeling). He incorporated his
nanorods for use in plastic-nanocrystal hybrid solar cells. And there hangs a
tale. It turns out that since the nanorods were randomly mixed for mass pro-
duction, they weren’t especially energy efficient. That led to his next discov-
ery — tetrapods — pyramid-shaped nanocrystals that resemble children’s
jacks. When these crystals align, each one has at least one peg that stands 
up — which increases their efficiency in converting sunlight to usable energy.
With such raw talent, nothing could hold him back. Other entries soon made
their way onto his résumé, including these:
 Founding editor of Nano Letters, a scientific journal devoted to nanotech
research
 Scientific founder of Nanosys Inc., a start-up specializing in 
nanomaterials
 Director of Berkeley Lab’s Molecular Foundry, one of five Department of
Energy research centers

Angela Belcher
Biomedical engineer Angela Belcher is an Associate Professor of Materials
Science at MIT. Before coming to MIT, she was a chemistry professor at the
University of Texas in Austin, where she pioneered the (cost-effective) use of
genetically modified viruses in the self-assembly of nanowires, thin films, and
other nanomaterials. In essence, she’s using Mother Nature to help build
nanostructures. Belcher has successfully combined inorganic and biochem-
istry, molecular biology, electrical engineering, and material science into one
lean, mean nanotechnological machine.
Her work promises a direct (and sizable) impact on drug discovery and deliv-
ery, materials and catalysts, and self-assembling electronic materials. For
example, she has coaxed viruses to crystallize and retain their structure
indefinitely — providing a new approach for preserving vaccines without
refrigeration. This approach may well revolutionize the way vaccines are 
distributed to other parts of the world, particularly to developing countries
where refrigeration may be in short supply. (The added bonus here is that
these viruses are harmless to humans and animals.) Other applications
include making thin films possible for the stable storage of proteins and 
DNA. (Think drug delivery.)
Professor Belcher has won numerous awards and accolades, including 
the prestigious 2004 MacArthur Foundation award — also known as a 
“genius grant.” She is also co-founder of the nanotech start-up Cambrios
Technologies Corp., which uses biomolecules to produce better, cheaper
electronic devices.
Visionaries: Richard Feynman 
and Eric Drexler
Once described as “The Smartest Man in the World,” Richard Feynman laid
out the essentials of a nanotech capability in his 1959 talk, “There’s Plenty of
Room at the Bottom.” Educated at MIT and Princeton, he started his career
as a group leader for the Manhattan Project in his early 20s. In 1950, he
moved on to Caltech. His highly effective teaching broke down problems and
concepts to their simplest level, and guided students to discover the answers
themselves. (Hmm . . . maybe he should’ve written this book? Oh well. Glad
he left some of the fun for us.) He won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965,
sharing it with Julian Schwinger and Shin’ichiro Tomonaga, for work on how
subatomic particles interact. In 1986, he worked on the commission investi-
gating the Challenger space shuttle explosion, accurately and simply demon-
strating the cause of the disaster. Although he died in 1988, his vision for
nanotechnology’s potential lives on.
323
Chapter 15: Ten (Or So) Nanotech Movers and Shakers

Also from MIT, Eric Drexler illustrates molecular manufacturing and lays the
groundwork for the public’s current perception of nanotechnology some of
which is still, um, mired in speculation) in his 1986 book Engines of Creation:
The Coming Era of Nanotechnology. This is the book that first mentions “gray
goo,” warning of self-replicating nanotechnology running amok and covering
the earth. Science fiction, always fond of farfetched disasters, grabbed the
topic and ran with it. Most scientists downplayed this scenario, but Drexler’s
book sparked a wider interest in nanotechnology and brought it to the atten-
tion of the public. Also in 1986, Drexler founded the Foresight Institute to 
prepare society for emerging technological revolutions. He is currently a
Research Fellow at the Institute for Molecular Manufacturing, a sister organi-
zation to the Foresight Institute, promoting the science and engineering of
molecular manufacturing.
Nanoshells: Naomi Halas 
and Jennifer West
Drs. Halas and West have continued to make progress with nanoshells that
can find and “cook” cancer cells. As we describe in Chapter 11, gold-coated
silica spheres enter the bloodstream and attach themselves to cancer cells —
and when illuminated with a laser, the nanoshells give off enough heat to kill
the tumor cells. Naomi Halas invented nanoshells in the 1990s; along with
Jennifer West, she applied them to cancer therapy. Since then, they’ve contin-
ued to test this capability, seeking FDA approval for human use. They both 
co-founded Nanospectra Biosciences as a way to market their research. Their
work is considered the “Best Discovery of 2003” by Nanotechnology Now Web
site and they were finalists for Small Times magazine’s 2004 Nanotechnology
Researcher of the Year. Separately, Jennifer West’s research in synthesizing
blood vessels won Technology Review magazine’s 2003 TR100 Top Young
Innovators award.
Molecular Logic: James 
Tour and Mark Reed
James Tour is a chemist at Rice University. Mark Reed is a physicist at Yale
University. Together, they make molecular logic. While Tour was at the
University of South Carolina, he collaborated with Reed throughout the
1990s. Tour would synthesize the molecules and Reed would perform the
324
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

experiments. They coax the molecules into spontaneously orienting them-
selves onto the electrodes. If this approach truly works out, it may be a
cheap replacement for silicon-based computer chips. Additionally, since 
they incorporate molecules, these innovations could bridge the gap between
biology and computing — resulting in implantable biochips that respond 
to chemical clues and discharge an appropriate dose of medication.
Regardless of long-term applications, Tour and Reed were thinking big and
small at the same time when they co-founded Molecular Electronics Corp.
(MEC) in 1999. Their goal was to develop a viable complement to silicon —
molecules working alongside silicon, the material used in our computers.
Since 2002, MEC has identified over 15,000 circuit connection devices per-
forming a variety of physical, chemical, and production tests and analyses.
Investors: Steve Jurvetson and Josh Wolfe
Steve Jurvetson is the managing director at Draper Fisher Jurvetson, a ven-
ture capital firm — and got there on a fast track. Jurvetson whizzed through
Stanford undergrad as an electrical engineer (first in class), stayed on for his
master’s degree, and finished it all off with another degree from Stanford’s
Business School. He matches this scholarly knowledge with calculated risk
and long-range vision. Not only did he make partner rank with Draper Fisher
within six months of arriving (in 1996), he backed Hotmail when it was a
start-up — and sold it to Microsoft, two years later, for $400 million. Voted
Fortune magazine’s “Brain Trust of Top Ten Minds,” Jurvetson is a regular
proponent of nanotech as co-chairman of the NanoBusiness Alliance.
Josh Wolfe is co-founder and managing partner of Lux Capital, a venture 
capital firm focusing on nanotechnology investments. He has a long and
established financial history with Salomon Smith Barney, Merrill Lynch, and
Prudential Securities. He is a vocal proponent of nanotech, speaking as a
guest at Harvard, getting himself quoted in The Wall Street Journal. Wolfe 
is also a co-founder and advisor to The NanoBusiness Alliance and a Senior
Associate of the Foresight Institute for Nanotechnology (Eric Drexler’s organi-
zation). He has been honored by Crain’s Magazine as one of “The 40 under
40” in 2003 — and has made a splash as author of the “Nanotech Report” 
and Editor of “Forbes/Wolfe Nanotech Report.”

sites first and save yourself some time and trouble.
www.nanotechnologyfordummies.com
Hey! How ’bout that! This book has its own Web site . . . although the name is
a bit long. Regardless, this is your go-to source for information on nanotech-
nology and this book! This Web site will field questions and provide updates

on nanotechnology — with the ultimate goal of preparing the way for a
second edition of this book.
nanobot.blogspot.com
Howard Lovy’s Nanobot blog is a good source for up-to-date information on
things nanotechnological. Howard scours the Internet, looking for anything
nanotech-related, and invites viewers to expand upon his more-than-able syn-
opses by posting comments. This site provides surprisingly good compila-
tions and coverage. Consider it your second “go-to source” for nanotech
information.
www.azonano.com
Touted as “The A to Z of Nanotechnology,” this Web site provides a wealth of
knowledge about anything nano. Answers to virtually any question you may
have on nanomaterials, applications, or industries are laid out from A to Z.
The site is very easy to navigate, useful, and (best of all) free.
www.nano.gov
This is the United States Government’s National Nanotechnology Initiative
Web site. It details the initiative’s background, lists the government agencies
involved with nano, and points you to research and university centers doing
nano stuff. (There’s even a Teacher Resources section.) It is certainly a good
starting point for determining the government’s flow of money and which
research is being pursued.
The Sandia National Laboratory maintains another U.S. Government Web site
devoted to nanoscience. (Check it out at nano.sandia.gov). It has some
very good descriptions — and, if you have high bandwidth, good videos.
Check out, for example, the videos of micro-electromechanical systems
(MEMS) as they interact with dust mites (www.mems.sandia.gov).
www.forbesnanotech.com
The Forbes/Wolfe Nanotech Report’s Web site provides some great, easy to
read, semi-technical articles expanding upon topics you may have read about
in this book. Some portions of the Web site are subscriber-only (with a hefty
price tag), but they also have a lot of good stuff that’s free. The “Wolfe”

association promoting nanotechnology. This Web site gives you a heads
up on some of the business applications that are being developed, along
with conferences you may attend.
 www.phantomsnet.com: Cientifica, the brains behind www.phantomsnet.
com, provides in-depth nanotechnology reports and consulting expertise
targeting large companies. Although the reports are very expensive, 
the site also provides some free news articles — a great resource for
Fortune 500 CEOs looking to expand their business into nanotech.
www.fda.gov/nanotechnology
If you’re into nano-health, the United States Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) has a section devoted to nanotechnology. Their Web site outlines how
it plans to ensure that nanotechnological products, whether they’re in the
form of cosmetics, drugs, food, or medical devices, are both safe and effec-
tive. The National Cancer Institute (nano.cancer.gov) has a Web site that
lays out the role of nanotechnology in the diagnosis, prevention, and treat-
ment of cancer.
www.nano.org.uk
The Institute of Nanotechnology, based in the United Kingdom, provides
worldwide coverage of technological developments working closely with gov-
ernments, universities, and companies. For the CEO, they have nanotechnol-
ogy reports on the U.K., Europe, North America, and Asia Pacific. For the
student looking for nano-enlightenment on the cheap, they have great images
and animations.
Meanwhile, on the other side of the world, the Asia-Pacific Nanotechnology
Forum (www.apnf.org) fires up the discussion among Pacific Rim countries.
The APNF’s goal is to facilitate information flow between developers and
investors throughout the region.
www.foresight.org
The Foresight Institute’s Web site is a nonprofit organization with the mission
of helping prepare society for future nanotechnologies. Since one of its main

goals is promoting Foresight Institute founder Eric Drexler’s vision of molecu-
lar manufacturing, it should come as no surprise that you can download
Drexler’s entire Engines of Creation text from the Web site. Nanodot, a spinoff
of the Foresight Institute (www.nanodot.org), is a news-and-discussion Web
site that provides general information about nanotechnology.
Other great sites
If you still have the energy after chasing down all this good info, check out
these nanotechnology sites as well:
 www.nsti.org: The Nano Science and Technology Institute provides 
a good compilation of news broken down by subject (for example,
microsystems, medical, materials, and so on). NSTI hosts the yearly
Nanotech conference and trade show.
 www.nanotech-now.com: Nanotech Now provides general information
on nanotech, including up-to-date news and a “Best of Nanotechnology”
listing covering the last few years.
 www.howstuffworks.com: Although not specific to nanotech, this site
breaks down difficult material into easy to understand visual explana-
tions. It covers the basics of computers, electronics, science, and more.
Magazines
Yep, even the futuristic world of nanotechnology has a place for magazines.
The online versions are easy to call up on-screen; the hard-copy versions you
don’t even have to plug in.
Technology Review
A journal published by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Technology
Review aims to promote the understanding of emerging technology. Although
not exclusively nanotech, it certainly picks some winners when describing
which new technology makes it from the lab into the marketplace. This is the
magazine subscription to get your nano-fan this Christmas. (For more info,

Small Times
Small Times is a nanotech magazine — and nothing but a nanotech magazine —
providing comprehensive news coverage and searchable archives for those
who want it all nanotech all the time. A lot of the main articles are free online
but they also provide a bimonthly hard copy. (You can find out more at www.
smalltimes.com.)
Science, Nature, and Nano Letters
These three journals are strictly meant for the hard-core nanotech enthusi-
asts — Nano Letters is strictly nanotechnology, whereas Science and Nature
cover general science, including nanotech. The content is cutting-edge scien-
tific articles — not for the technologically timid. However, if you’re truly inter-
ested in the topic — and don’t mind wading through the technical jargon —
you can gain a priceless handle on the science behind nanotechnology.
Speaking of price, these technical journals can have pretty high subscription
rates, so check them out at your library and give them the once-over before
you pull out your MasterCard.

Glossary
adenosine triphosphate (ATP): Organic molecule that stores energy in a bio-
logical cell.
amines: Organic compounds used as attachment points for molecular 
structures.
amphiphile: A molecule that has two distinct parts; a hydrophilic (water-
loving) head and a hydrophobic (water-fearing) tail.
atom: Smallest particle of an element, composed of three types of charged
particles: protons (positive), neutrons (neutral), and electrons (negative).
atomic force microscope (AFM): A scanning probe instrument that measures
the atomic force acting on its tip as it moves along the surface of a sample.
band gap: The energy difference between the top of the valence band and the
bottom of the conduction band in semiconductors and insulators. In insula-
tors, the band gap is large — it requires a lot of energy to move valence elec-
trons to the conduction band. In semiconductors, the band gap is not as
large; it doesn’t require as much energy to move electrons from the valence
band to the conduction band. Adding impurities to the semiconductor (called
doping) can change the band gap and the amount of energy needed to move
electrons. In conductors (metals), the valence band and conduction band
overlap, resulting in no band gap.
benzene: A ring of 6 carbon atoms, each with one hydrogen atom.
bioactive materials: Materials capable of interacting with living tissue.
bioavailability: The extent to which a drug successfully targets specific cells.
Used in measuring the effectiveness of drug delivery.
biometrics: Identification based on personal features such as face recogni-
tion or fingerprint.

systems and modern technology. Velcro is an example of biomimetics: the
plastic hooks and loops resemble plant burrs (hooks) that cling to animal fur
and clothing (loops). 
biosensor: A sensor that detects biological molecules such as proteins.

bottom-up fabrication: A construction process that works with the smallest
units of a material first (in this context, atoms) and builds them up into the

cantilever: A solid beam allowed to oscillate at one end. Used in atomic force
microscopes (AFMs).
carbon nanotube: A graphite sheet rolled up into a tube.
catalyst: A substance that reduces the amount of energy required during a
chemical reaction. Its presence increases the rate of reaction without the
consuming the catalyst.
chirality: In the context of this book, chirality is the “twist” of a carbon nan-
otube. Twisting carbon nanotubes down the length of the tube gives them
unique properties that depend upon the degree of the twist. (For example,
specific twists make a nanotube either metallic or semiconducting.)
colloidal self-assembly: A process by which colloids assemble themselves
into useful alignments; used in developing photonic crystals.
colloids: Very small particles (within the 1nm-to-1000nm range) that remain

scopic analysis by changing color.
composite: An engineered material composed of two or more components.
conduction band: The energy at which electrons can move freely through the

ships and patterns within the information.
decoherence: Decoherence is the breakdown of quantum properties (super-
position and entanglement) changing the behavior of the system from quantum
334
Nanotechnology For Dummies 

mechanical to classical physics. This is usually the result when a quantum
mechanical system interacts with its environment.

of voids between the sprigs, which allows it to carry drug molecules.
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA): The nucleic acid that carries the genetic blue-
print for all forms of cellular life.
diffraction: The spreading or bending of light as it passes by an object. An
example of diffraction is using a prism to spread sunlight into a spectrum of

properties, — as in the process that creates either n-type or p-type silicon.
electrochromatics: Materials that change color when energized by an electri-
cal current.
electroluminescence: Converting electrical energy into light.
electron-beam lithography (EBL): Fabrication method that uses a tight beam
of electrons to form nano-scale features on a substrate.
electro-osmosis: A method that uses an electric field to move liquids through
a nano-channel. The sides of the nano-channel’s wall are charged, allowing

rate inverse to their mass: the larger ones are slower than the smaller ones.
endocytosis: A process whereby cells absorb particles by enveloping them
with the help of vesicles formed from the cell wall.
enigma: A mystery wrapped in a riddle. “Atomic interactions at the nano-
scale are an enigma that is yet to be fully understood.” To Rich, nanotechnol-

339
Glossary

stream of electrons, scanning back and forth, and reading the reflected elec-
trons as they bounce off the surface.
scanning probe microscope: An instrument that studies the properties of
surfaces at the atomic level by scanning an atomically sharp probe over the
sample. This produces an image of the sample’s topography with atomic 
resolution.
scanning tunneling microscope (STM): The first scanning probe instrument —
measures electrons tunneling between a scanning tip and a conducting surface.
Schottky barrier: Area of resistance to electrical conduction, occurring at the
junction between the metal wires and the semiconductor in a computer
processor.
self-assembled monolayers (SAMs): A single layer of atoms or molecules that
has assembled itself under controlled conditions. This makes it possible to
design surfaces at the molecular scale.
self-assembly: Process that creates the specific conditions under which
atoms and molecules spontaneously arrange themselves into a final product.
An example of self-assembly is the automatic arrangement of phospholipids
into a cell wall.
semiconductor: Material that has more electrical conductivity than an insula-
tor (which has no conductivity) but less than a conductor; it can be made to
insulate or conduct electricity in patterns, as in a computer processor.
shape-memory alloy (SMA): A metal alloy that remembers its geometry. After
it is deformed, it is heater to a specific temperature and regains its original
geometry by itself.
single-electron transistor (SET): A transistor that switches between on and off
(in computer terms, 1 and 0) by using a single electron — much smaller than
a traditional transistor, which uses many electrons to switch.
single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT): A carbon nanotube with one wall.
Compare multiwalled carbon nanotube.
soft lithography: A process that uses polymers for molding and printing
micro- and nano-structures. Pioneered by George Whitesides and used for
microfluidics and its descendant, nanofluidics.
spectrometers: tools that reveal the composition of things by measuring the
light absorbed or emitted by atoms or molecules.

Nanotechnology For Dummies 

spintronics: “Spin-based electronics” that exploits not only an electron’s
charge but also its spin.
sputter deposition: A method of creating a thin film of metal by sputtering
fine particles onto a surface.
stent: An expandable wire mesh used to keep a blood vessel open.
strained silicon: New method of improving processor speed by stretching
individual silicon atoms apart so electrons flow through a transistor faster
with little resistance. Compare superconductor.
substrate: The supporting surface that serves as a base.
superconductor: A material through which electricity flows with zero 
resistance.
superlattice: A crystal formed of thin layers. A natural example is graphite.
superposition: When an object simultaneously possesses two or more values
of a specified quantity. Useful in the development of quantum computers.
surface tension: The pull of a liquid into its most compact form to minimize
the amount of energy used, keeping the surface area to a minimum.
surfactants: “Surface-active” molecules that reduce the surface tension
between two liquids. Surfactants are used in many detergents as a dispersant
between oil and water.
tetrapods: pyramid-shaped nanocrystals that resemble children’s jacks.
top-down fabrication: A construction process in which we first work at the
large scale and then cut away until we have a smaller product. This is similar
to a sculptor cutting away at a block of marble producing the final product, a
statue. Compare bottom-up fabrication.
transistor: A switch that determines whether a bit is a 1 or a 0.
uncertainty principle: In quantum mechanics, a principle made famous by
Werner Heisenberg: Measuring one property in a quantum state will perturb
another property. You can, for example, measure the position or momentum
of an electron — but not both at once.
valence electrons: The electrons in the outermost shell of an atom. These
electrons largely dictate the chemical reactions of the atom.
341
Glossary

van der Waals: Weak electrostatic forces between atoms.
vesicles: Micelles with two layers: a reverse micelle surrounded by a regular
micelle. Resembles the walls of biological cells.
viscosity: The measure of resistance of a fluid — its “thickness.”
water window: A range of frequencies in the electromagnetic spectrum that
are most easily transmitted through water, making them suitable for optical
imaging (800-1300nm).
wavelength: In physics, the distance between one wave peak and the next in
a transmitted wave of radiant energy. Typically measured in nanometers.
