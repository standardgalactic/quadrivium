I was pleased to respond to Ventus Publishing to write a textbook (which is split into 3 more manageable books, “Chemistry 
Maths 1”, “Chemistry Maths 2”, and “Chemistry Maths 3” which should be studied in sequence) that would help Chemistry 
students survive, and even enjoy, the Maths required for a Chemistry degree. I developed and presented tutorials on Maths 
to our first year Chemistry students over several years at the Chemistry Department, Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, 
Scotland. These tutorials have formed the basis for this workbook. I would like to thank the staff of Heriot-Watt University 
Chemistry Department for their help; and thank the students who for many years “suffered” these tutorials, I hope they 
helped them with their Chemistry degrees and later careers. Most of all I would like to thank my wife Jennifer for her 
encouragement and help over many years. 
I shall be delighted to hear from readers who have comments and suggestions to make, please email me. So that I can 
respond in the most helpful manner I will need your full name, your University, the name of your degree and which level 
(year) of the degree you are studying. I hope you find this workbook helpful and I wish you good luck with your studies.

Chemistry Maths 2
J. E. Parker, Honorary Senior Lecturer, Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh. 
This text teaches Maths from a Chemistry perspective so that the student can see the relevance of Maths as the Language 
of Chemistry. It is the second part of a three part series of texts. 
The text is aimed at first-year university undergraduates taking a degree in Chemistry or a Chemistry based subject such 
as Chemical Engineering, Chemical Physics, Molecular Biology, Biochemistry or Biology. The texts should also be useful to 
final year School or College students prior to their starting a university undergraduate degree. The material in Chemistry 
Maths 2 covers the last four teaching weeks of semester 1 and the first four weeks of semester 2 of a structured one-year 
Maths course for Chemists.
The text is made up of tutorial questions with fully worked solutions and is structured on a weekly basis to help the students 
to self-pace themselves. It contains many molecular structures and graphs in colour to illustrate both the Chemistry and 
the Maths. For ease of navigation there are page references between questions and their solutions (and back again) and also 
between the table of contents and the sections. These may be used in conjunction with the page viewer of your PDF reader.

Introduction
Introduction
Chemistry Maths 1, 2 and 3 are tutorial workbooks intended for first year undergraduates taking a degree in Chemistry or 
a Chemistry based subject such as Chemical Engineering, Chemical Physics, Molecular Biology, Biochemistry or Biology. The 
texts may also be very useful for final year school or college students prior to them starting an undergraduate degree. They 
are split into three in order to reduce file size and make handling on a laptop or tablet computer easier. Chemistry Maths 
1 covers the first 8 weeks of semester 1; Chemistry Maths 2 the remainder of semester 1 and the beginning of semester 2; 
and Chemistry Maths 3 the rest of semester 2. They each have chapter heading such as Week 1, Week 2 and so on. This 
is purely to help you self-pace your work on a weekly basis although I realize that the week numbers in Chemistry Maths 
2 and Chemistry Maths 3 will not correspond to your semester week numbers. 
This workbook is not a textbook! Use your Chemistry and Maths textbook to find out the details about the area covered. 
People will not really understand something, including Maths, until they can use it in a flexible way. Tutorials are a way 
of allowing you to practice your skills, in this case the Maths required by Chemists, so that the Maths will become easier 
with practice. 
I have deliberately repeated the introductory sections of Chemistry Maths 1 (Parker 2011) here for your convenience. 
Please also study Section 1.1.4 of Chemistry Maths 1 on Straight Line Graphs (Parker 2011). Several helpful textbooks 
for first year Chemists and their references are given at the end of this workbook.

Introduction
Introduction: Why Do Chemists Have To Do Maths?
Maths is a convenient and fast shorthand language that summarizes the details of a particular topic of Chemistry, it is 
the language of Chemistry. Maths is also the underlying language of all Science, Engineering, Economics and many other 
subjects. So we won’t be able to become fluent in Chemistry until we understand this “shorthand” language. 
Introduction: How The Chemistry Maths 2 Is Structured
At the beginning of your university Chemistry degree you may find that many of the chemistry examples used in this 
workbook have not yet been covered in your Chemistry course. Don’t worry we are trying to understand the Maths at the 
moment not the Chemistry, the Chemistry details will come later as you progress in your Chemistry degree. Just treat 
these examples as Maths examples, which is what they are, and solve the Maths. The Chemistry will add meaning to the 
Maths, which is otherwise a bit abstract. 
Introduction: Physical Quantities
In your Maths lessons in school or college the variables used were probably x and y and angles θ or α as these are the 
general symbols used in Maths. But in the sciences and engineering all the variables we use are physical quantities, such as 
mass, length, time, force, work, and so on. These physical quantities usually have a conventional symbol agreed by usage 
of the international community of scientists. These symbols are used in the Maths equations describing the phenomenon 
of interest. A few examples of the symbols used for physical quantities are m for mass, c for the velocity of light and E for 
energy. These come together in the equation that everyone has met, even if we may not be sure what it means, E = mc2. 
In Maths this is equivalent to y = ax2 which could apply to many situations, however, E = mc2 only applies to the specific 
process of converting mass into energy. So this workbook will get you accustomed to using Maths in the real world of 
manipulating equations made up of physical quantities written in the accepted scientific way.
Physical Quantity = (pure number)× (units)
Physical quantities consist of two parts, a pure number and a unit, which are inseparable. An example would be  
c = 2.998 m s−1 where c is the symbol for the velocity of light. In order to clearly distinguish the physical quantity from 
its constituent parts, the physical quantity is written in italics and the pure number and the units are in roman (upright) 
font. Don’t worry too much about hand written material but for typed material it should be done correctly. 
For units named after people such as Sir Isaac Newton or Lord Kelvin, when referring to the person their name has an 
initial capital (Newton or Kelvin) but the unit is all lower case (newton or kelvin) and the symbol for the unit is initial 
capital (N or K). The use of initial capital for units has a few exception (for historical reasons) such the second (s) or the 
kilogram (kg). 
When we substitute a physical quantity for its symbol into an equation we must substitute both the number and the units 
in the equation, they are inseparable, they go together like the two sides of a piece of paper.

Introduction
As far as possible the workbook is organized on a weekly basis. Go through the examples and work out the solution yourself 
on paper then check the solution. A full solution is there for you to check that you are correct and to show the method 
of solving the problem. To begin with, the solutions give every single step but as you progress through the workbook 
the explanations become less detailed. When you do finally cover the Chemistry involved in the examples during your 
Chemistry degree you won’t be blinded or scared by the Maths, as by then you will be happy playing around with equations. 
Introduction: Suggested Textbooks (see page 101)
The Chemistry Maths 2 may be used with any Maths textbook, however, it is designed to interface with the textbook 
(Stroud and Booth 2007). Despite its name of Engineering Mathematics Stroud and Booth covers all the Maths needed 
by all the sciences and engineering subjects. Chemistry Maths 2 gives chemical examples of the Maths concepts. If you 
want to look up any first year chemistry then any General Chemistry textbook is useful but the textbook (Blackman, 
Bottle, Schmid, Mocerino & Wille 2012) is excellent. In later years of your course then (Atkins & de Paula 2009) has many 
examples of the interplay between Chemistry and Maths mainly in the area of Physical Chemistry. 
One final comment. A common mistake of Chemistry students is thinking you need to memorize all the equations you 
come across in any area of the subject. This is impossible and I know that I (or any other member of staff) can’t remember 
them. There are a very small number of equations that become familiar by usage and which you remember without really 
having to try, all the rest come from being able to apply your Maths to this small number of equations (or to equations 
supplied in an exam or from a textbook) and this enables you to get to your target.

1	 Week 1: Chemistry, Advanced 
Differentiation and the Maclaurin 
and Taylor Series
Advanced differentiation and the Maclaurin and Taylor series will take both Week 1 and Week 2. There are five Maths 
topics to be considered with respect to advanced differentiation and the tutorial questions reflect some of the most common 
uses that Chemistry makes of the five topics of advanced differentiation. These are the product rule, the quotient rule, the 
chain rule, parametric differentiation, and Maclaurin or Taylor series expansions of simple functions. 
The Taylor series represents a curve or a function as a sum of terms. Where each term is calculated from the next higher 
derivative at a single point of the curve. The Taylor series expansion for the function f (a + x ) is, 
f (a + x) = f (a) + x d f (a)

Week 1 Tutorial Questions
1.2.1	
Question 1: Quantum Mechanics in Two Dimensions
Consider a particle, of mass m, in a two-dimensional box. This might be an electron confined in a quantum well on a 
semiconductor surface, for example, which is the Chemistry responsible for some solid state display devices. Fig. 1.1 shows 
the wavefunction of one of the many possible energy levels of an electron confined in such a situation. 
 Figure 1.1: Wavefunction of the Allowed Energy Level n1 = 2, n2 = 2, L1 = 1, L2 = 1.
The energy levels En1, n2 for the particle depends on the lengths of the two sides of the box, L1 and L2, and the quantum 
numbers associated with these two directions are n1 and n2. The quantum numbers may each independently take the 
integer values 1, 2, 3, … that is n1 = 1, 2, 3. … and n2 = 1, 2, 3, … 
En1 n2 =
h2
8 m(
n1
2
L1
2 + n2
2
L2
2)
Keeping En1,n2 the energy of the particle constant, determine dL1/dL2 (where L1 is an unknown function of L2). This is an 
example of implicit differentiation, i.e. find dEn1,n2/dL2 and set this equal to zero as the energy is constant. The resulting 
expression may then be rearranged to find an equation for dL1/dL2. 
Jump to Solution 1 (see page 16)
1.2.2	
Question 2: Electrons in Atomic Orbitals
The probability of finding an electron at a given distance or radius, r, from the nucleus of an atom is given by the radial 
probability distribution, P. For the hydrogen atom in its lowest energy atomic orbital, 1s, the radial probability distribution 
function is given below.

Where a0 is a constant called the Bohr radius. 
What is the most probable radius at which to find the electron? In order to find the maximum value of P we need to find 
the differential dP/dr using the product rule and set this equal to zero. 
Jump to Solution 2 (see page 18)
1.2.3	
Question 3: Vibration of Molecular Bonds and Heat Capacity
The contribution to the total energy of n moles of diatomic molecules arising from their molecular vibrations is given 
by the equation, 
E = n N Ahcν
exp(−hcν β )
1 −exp(−h cν β )
Where n, NA, h, c, ν are all constants for n moles of a given molecule. β = 1/kBT with kB = Boltzmann’s constant (kB = 
R/NA); R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature; ν is the vibrational frequency of the chemical bond; NA is 
Avogadro’s constant; h is Planck’s constant; and c is the velocity of light. 
Find an equation for the heat capacity of the collection of molecules at constant volume, CV, by substituting for the 
differential dE/dβ in the equation below. 
CV = −k Bβ 2 d E
d β
The differentiation dE/dβ will require the quotient rule. Then at the final stage substitute for β = 1/kBT and then kB = R/NA.

Using implicit differentiation, we differentiate the energy En1, n2 with respect to the distance L2 because the question asks 
for dL1/dL2 with dL2 as the denominator. Note that h2/8m is a constant which can be taken outside the differential.

Either h2/8m equals zero or the terms in the bracket equals zero. As h2/8m cannot be equal to zero, then the bracketed

The derivative is equal to zero if any of the three terms involving r are equal to zero i.e. (8r/a0
3) = 0; or exp(−2r/a0) = 0; 
or (1 − r/a0) = 0. 
The first term, (8r/a0
3), is zero at r = 0. 
Looking at the exponential term the radial distance of the electron from the nucleus is always positive and so −2r/a0 is 
always negative. Fig. 1.2 shows the shape of a general negative exponential function and the exponential term is zero 
exp(−2r/a0) = 0 at r = ∞.

For the three terms the derivative is zero at r = 0, r = ∞, and (1 − r/a0) = 0, respectively. Also the probability distribution 
function P is zero at r = 0 and r = ∞ thus the maximum must be when the (1 − r/a0) = 0. Which gives the maximum in 
the radial probability function at r = a0 the Bohr radius. 
Pmax is at r = a 0 = 0.5292× 10−10 m

“surface” distance as shown in Fig. 1.3 and indeed asymptotically extends out to r = ∞ as we have shown.

Question 1: Consecutive Chemical Reactions
Chemical reactions may consist of several separate chemical steps. For example, the decay of a radioactive element 
may result in a daughter isotope which also decays. Consecutive chemical reactions are also very common in organic, 
inorganic and biochemical reactions. An example is the reaction of t-butyl bromide (tertiary-butyl bromide or 2-bromo-
2-methylpropane) dissolved in water containing a small concentration of sodium hydroxide. In Chemistry this reaction 
is an example of an SN1 reaction. The first slow reaction is the loss of bromide ion Br− from the t-butyl bromide to form 
a t-butyl carbocation. Figs 2.1 shows the structures of t-butyl bromide, the t-butyl carbocation. 
 Figure 2.1: t-Butyl Bromide and t-Butyl Carbocation Structures. 
C = dark grey, H = grey, Br = dark red.
The faster second reaction is the covalent bond formation between a hydroxide ion and a t-butyl carbocation to form the 
product molecule, a tertiary alcohol, t-butanol. 
Fig 2.2 shows the structure of t-butanol.

Question 2: Vibrational Energy for a Collection of Molecules
All molecules are vibrating all the time, even at zero kelvin, their bonds are never “stationary” (this is due to Heisenberg's 
Uncertainty Principle). The bond distance of a vibrating diatomic molecule oscillates between a minimum value and a 
maximum value. The resistance of the bond to stretching is the force constant k, and the displacement from the equilibrium 
distance, re, is (r − re). The vibrations may be treated rather like a mechanical spring and the potential energy, V, due to 
the vibration of the bond is V = ½k(r − re)2 as shown as the red parabola in Fig. 2.3. Treating the vibrating bond like a 
mechanical spring is called the harmonic oscillator approximation and the vibrational quantum number, v, may take the 
values v = 0, 1, 2, 3, …

Use a Maclaurin series expansion of exp(−hcνβ) to show that when the temperature is high (and thus hcνβ « 1) that the

sequence is the chemical “bottleneck” which determines the overall speed. Thus the concentrations of the final product 
[C] and the intermediate molecule [B] changes at the same rate. For the SN1 reaction of t-butyl bromide the first slow 
reaction, the loss of Br−, is the rate determining step.

Week 3: Chemistry and First-Order Ordinary Differential Equations
3	 Week 3: Chemistry and First-Order 
Ordinary Differential Equations
3.1	
Introduction to Ordinary Differential Equations
An ordinary differential equation (ODE) is an equation between a dependent variable y and one independent variable, x, 
and one or more derivatives of y with respect to x. Some general example are, 
a d y
d x +by + c = 0
ad 2 y
d x2 + b d y
d x +cy + d = 0
a d2 y
d x 2 + by + c = 0
Where a, b, c and d are constants. ODE represent dynamic situations, that is where quantities are changing and such 
situations are very common in Chemistry and chemically based science and engineering. A simple example of an ODE 
is Newton’s Second Law of Motion that the force at a certain time, F(t ), equals mass times acceleration. 
m d2 x
dt 2 = F (t)
The word ordinary is to distinguish them from partial differential equations, where the dependent variable, y, is a function 
of more than one independent variables, x, z, etc. 
3.1.1	
First-Order Ordinary Differential Equations
a d y
d x +by = f (x , y)
This type of ODE is called a first-order differential equation as it involves the first derivative as the highest derivative. The 
use of the term order in Maths to describe an ODE must not be confused with the use of the term order in Chemistry 
to describe the kinetic behaviour of reactions. Thus a second-order rate of reaction might involve an equation similar to 
one of the following both of which are first-order ODEs. First-order ODEs are common in chemical kinetics where we 
are measuring the speed or rate of an event (e.g. the rate of chemical reaction, and the rate of diffusion). 
d [A]
d t
= k [A]2
or
d[A]
dt
= k [A][B]
If the first-order ODE can be rearranged to be in the form below it can be solved by direct integration (see Parker 2011, 
Week 7 and Week 8). 
d y
d x = f (x)
∫d y = ∫f (x)d x

Chemistry Maths 2

Week 3: Chemistry and First-Order Ordinary Differential Equations
One the other hand, if the first-order ODE can only be rearranged to be in the form below it can be solved by the separation 
of the variables method (see Parker 2011, Section 7.2.1). 
d y
d x = f (x , y)
Either of these methods of solution will lead to a constant of integration which may be found knowing one boundary 
condition, for example, in kinetics it might be the initial concentration of the reactant [A]0 at time equals zero, t = 0. 
The Maths of first-order differential equations is also used to locate the turning points (maxima, minima, and points of 
inflexion) of plots of physical data. First-order ODE tutorial questions will be covered in Week 3. 
3.1.2	
Second-Order Ordinary Differential Equations
In Chemistry the other type of ODE that commonly occurs is the second-order ODE. A second-order ODE involved the 
second derivative as the highest derivative, such as 
a d2 y
d x2 + bd y
d x + cy + d = 0
Where a, b, c, d are constants. In Chemistry second-order ODEs are common in quantum mechanics (also called wave 
mechanics). The Schrödinger equation describes the wavefunctions for a particle of mass m. For instance if the particle 
is moving in one-dimension, x, then, 
−
h2
8π2m
d2ψ
d x 2 + V (x)ψ = Eψ
The wavefunction ψ (psi) is related to the probability of the molecule being at a position x. The wavefunction ψ varies 
with the position x so should really be written ψ(x) but for clarity I have written it just as ψ. V(x) is the potential energy 
of the particle as a function of its position in the one-dimension x. E is the total energy of the particle (the sum of the 
potential and the kinetic energy and is constant) and h is Planck’s constant.. 
Solving a second-order differential equation requires that we know two boundary conditions, which might be in our 
example, the values of ψ at the two ends of the one-dimension x. We will solve some simple second-order differential 
equations (Schrödinger equations) for chemically relevant areas. Second-order ODE will be covered in Week 4.

absorbed in a beam of light of a known wavelength. In the solution the intensity of light decreases as it moves away from 
the source owing to the absorption by molecules previously encountered. The probability of each absorption by a molecule 
is proportional to the “local” intensity of the light, and the number of molecules (that is concentrating times volume). 
Hence the decrease in intensity −dI of a parallel beam of light, per unit area of the solution, in a distance dx along the 
beam’s direction due to a concentration of absorber molecules [A] is shown in Fig. 3.2. 
 Figure 3.2: Quantitative Absorption of Light by a Molecule.
−d I = (constant)(intensity of light)(concentration of molecules)(volume)
−d I = κ I [A]d x
Where the constant, κ kappa, is the strength of absorption of the light of the given wavelength by the particular absorbing 
molecule, and the volume is a small length dx of unit area. 
This gives the first-order ODE shown below. 
−d I
d x = κ I [A]
1)	 Solve this first-order ODE for the intensity I if light transmitted through the total length of solution, l, 
assuming that the original intensity is I0. 
2)	 Convert your solution to a form consistent with log10 rather that natural logs. Convert kappa κ to the 
equivalent log to base 10 absorption coefficient, ε epsilon, with units of L mol−1 cm−1. 
3)	 Chlorophyll-a (Fig. 3.3) is one of the main photosynthetic pigments present in most plants that 
photosynthesize. It absorbs strongly in the 400-500 nm range and less strongly in the 650-700 nm range but 
lets most of the green-yellow light through and thus leaves appears greenish.

 Figure 3.3: Chlorophyll-a. C = dark grey, H = grey, O = red, N = blue, Mg = green.
An analytical chemist needs to measure the concentration of chlorophyll-a. A solution (in methanol) placed in a 1 cm 
length optical cell and the solution transmits 1.5% of the incident light at a wavelength of 417.8 nm. If the absorption 
coefficient was previously measured as 111,700 L mol−1 cm−1 at 417.8 nm, calculate the concentration of the chlorophyll

Question 3: Diffusion of Molecules in Liquids, Gases or Solids
Diffusion of molecules in a gas or liquid or solid takes place by the molecules making a series of short steps, each step ends 
and begins by a collision with another molecule which causes a random change in direction and the speed of movement. 
The molecules movement is called a random-walk. If there is a concentration gradient of the molecule then there will be 
an overall movement of the molecule from high concentration towards low concentration. 
 Figure 3.4: Linear Concentration Gradient of a Molecule.
For a linear concentration gradient as shown in Fig. 3.4 the flux of molecules diffusing is J mol m−2 s−1 and it is equal to 
J = −Dd c

Week 3: Chemistry and First-Order Ordinary Differential Equations
The negative sign is for a positive flux from left to right, there is a negative concentration gradient from left to right. 
The diffusion constant D m2 s−1 varies from one molecule to another and also depends upon the solvent molecule. The 
concentration gradient is dc/dx mol L−1 m−1. The above equation is the basis of Fick’s First Law, but a more usable version 
of Fick’s First Law is to note that the flux is the number of moles per area per second and write Fick’s First Law as,
d n
d t = −DA d c
d x
The average net distance, d, travelled (along the concentration gradient) by a molecule from its starting position during 
its random-walk in a time t is,
d = (2 D t)

Diffusion is an important aspect of processes as diverse as the passage of some ions and molecules through biological cell 
walls; respiration; fluid dynamics of both jet engines and blood in your veins and arteries; drug absorption; semiconductor 
fabrication; and flames, combustion and explosions; to name but a few! 
Sucrose has a diffusion constant in water at 20oC and 1 atmosphere pressure of D = 0.522×10−9 m2 s−1. A membrane of 1.5 
micron (1.5×10−6 m) width and area 2.4×10−6 m2, separates two sucrose solutions. Firstly, calculate how many moles of 
sucrose pass through the membrane in 10 minutes when the concentration difference is 0.1 mol L−1. Secondly, calculate 
the average net distance, d, travelled by an individual sucrose molecule in this time.

Where C is the constant of integration. Using the boundary condition that [I]0 = 6.72×10−3 mol L−1 at t = 0 s enables the

So in 10 minutes (or dt = 600 s) the change in the number of moles of sucrose is,

d = 7.9145× 10−4 m
Even though the sucrose is travelling at 100s of metres per second, the random-walk means that the diffusion distance 
it is less than 1 millimetre in 10 minutes at 20oC in a water solution. We must not confuse dn which has a roman d and 
which is the operator part of the differential, with the variable d (italic d) the random-walk distance.

Most Chemistry textbooks gloss over this integration in order to save space as it is long but it is not complicated. We are 
going to look at it in detail, because if you can do this integration, then you are well equipped to handle any other long-
winded integration that you come across in your later career as a Chemist. Concentrating on the integral itself for the 
moment. For clarity let a be equal to the constants a = M/2RT this gives the integral part of the equation as, 
∫
v= 0 
v= ∞ 
exp(−a v2) v3 d v
For our integral let us substitute z = v2 then dz = 2v dv and the integral is then,
∫
z= 0
z= ∞
exp(−a z) z
2 d z
This is the integral of a product and is found by integrating by parts (Stroud & Booth 2007). Integration by parts makes 
use of the reverse of the product rule for differentiation. As a reminder, if u and v are functions of x then the differential 
of the product is
d(u v)
d x
= u d v
d x + v d u
d x
Integrating both sides, then on the left hand side we arrive at the original function, a product of two terms.

This is a remarkably simple result of our integration by parts. The definition of the average speed is that there are the

(4π(M/2πRT)3/2) and x = v/(2RT/M)1/2 and the most probable speed vmp = (2RT/M)1/2 and average speed v = (8RT/πM)1/2.

Week 4 Tutorial Questions
4.1.1	
Question 1: Unconstrained Movement of a Molecule in One-Dimension
Consider the free motion of a molecules moving in “infinitely” large space (that is infinitely large compared with the size of 
the molecule). The Schrödinger equation describes the wavefunctions for a particle of mass, m, moving in one-dimension, 
x, E is the total energy, the sum of the potential and the kinetic energy, it is constant and does vary with position and h 
is Planck’s constant (see Section 3.1.2). 
−h2
8π2m
d 2ψ
d x2 + V (x)ψ = Eψ
The wavefunction ψ (psi) is related to the probability of the molecule being at a position x. The wavefunction ψ varies 
with the position x so should really be written ψ(x) but for clarity I have written it just as ψ. V(x) is the potential energy 
of the molecule as a function of its position in the one-dimension x. In our question we have free motion which means 
that the molecule is not subjected to any external forces. As the molecule experiences no forces the potential energy must 
be constant and we are free to define its value. If we let V(x) = 0 then the Schrödinger equations is simplified.

Solve the second-order ODE Schrödinger equation and find the total energy E of our molecule. What can you deduce from 
your solution of the quantum mechanics of the free motion in infinite space of a particle (a molecule in our example).

The two infinite potential energy walls are the two boundary conditions for our second-order ODE. The wavefunction must 
be equal to zero, ψ = 0, at the two boundaries in order for the wave to “reflect” at the walls exactly, so the wavefunction can 
persist through time, that is the wavefunction is a standing wave. Quantum mechanics gives the trial wavefunction below.

For the general equation of a wave we have,
ψ = Asin(2 π
λ x)+ Bcos(2π
λ x)
Where λ is the wavelength of our wavefunction. In order to be a standing wave and persist through time the wavefunction 
must satisfy a cyclic boundary condition that the wavelengths must fit exactly into the circumference, i.e. there are an 
integral number of wavelengths in the circumference, see Fig. 4.4. 
Figure 4.4: Wavefunctions (Blue) for a Particle on a Ring (Black).
The shapes of the wavefunctions are shown in Fig. 4.4, the wavefunction has a uniform amplitude around the ring for ψ0, 
with one wavelength for ψ1 and with two wavelengths for ψ2. Using Maths this cyclic boundary condition of an integral 
number of wavelengths fitting the circumference of the ring is equivalent to, 
ml λ = 2πr where ml = 0, ± 1, ± 2, ± 3, ⋯
The quantum number for rotational motion has, by convention, the symbol ml (don’t confuse this m for the mass of the 
particle). The plus and minus values are for the particle to move clockwise or anti-clockwise around the ring. But changing 
the direction of rotation (positive or negative values of ml) does not change the energy of the wavefunction. For ml = 0 
the particle has the same probability of being found anywhere on the ring. The trial wavefunction for the particle on a 
ring is given below.

Question 4: Motion of a Particle on a Ring, Absorption Spectrum of Benzene
Continuing the ideas developed in Question 3, as benzene has 6 π-electrons and applying Pauli's exclusion principle 
there will be 2 π-electrons in ml = 0, 2 π-electrons in ml = −1 and 2 π-electrons in ml = +1, and so the highest occupied 
molecular orbitals (HOMO) are ml = ± 1 and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) are ml = ± 2 (see Fig. 4.5). 
Figure 4.5: Benzene π-Electron Energies for the Particle on a Ring Model.
The C-C bond distance in benzene is 1.40 Å and so for the regular hexagon the radius r = 1.40 Å may be used in the 
approximation of treating it as a circular ring. 
Calculate the wavelength of light that would be absorbed in order to excite the transition from ml = ± 1 to ml = ± 2, 
using the allowed energy equation that you derived for Question 3, the energy of a photon of light and the equation for 
the wave-nature of light.

The unconstrained motion of the molecule has the same energy as the classical Newtonian translational energy and is 
non-quantized. It is the presence of the boundary conditions which leads to the quantization and if the one-dimensional 
box is infinite it does not have any boundary conditions.

sin(3π/8), sin(π/2), sin(5π/8), sin(3π/4), sin(7π/8), sin(π) you can use these values to sketch the wavefunctions for n = 1. 
Using a similar method will enable you to sketch the wavefunction for n = 2, as in Fig 4.6 with the wavefunctions in red.
 Figure 4.6: Wavefunctions for n = 1 and n = 2 for a Particle in a One-Dimensional Box.
In Fig. 4.6 the wavefunction (in red) has one maximum for n = 1, and the wavefunction has two maxima for n = 2. On 
the other hand, the total allowed energies (in blue) E1 and E2 are both constant and don’t vary with the position of the 
particle in the box.

The energy of the transition in benzene due to the absorption of a photon is ΔE = (E2 − E1) and substituting the values 
for the physical quantities h = 6.6261×10−34 J s; m = 9.1094×10−31 kg; r = 1.40×10−10 m; c = 2.9979×108 m s−1 we have,

Remembering that J = kg m2 s−2 this gives, 
Δ E = 9.3433× 10−19 J
Notice how molecular energies of single molecules are of the order 10−19 J. The wavelength required to be absorbed is 
calculated by the following method.

λ = 2.126× 10−7 m = 213 nm
Using the normal units for UV-visible light the wavelength is predicted to be 213 nm by the approximate treatment. Fig. 4.7 
shows that experimentally the absorption is at λmax ≈ 255 nm, so the agreement is pretty good for this first approximation.

Week 5 Tutorial Questions
5.1.1	
Question 1: Dissolution of a Solid by a Solvent
Dissolution of a solid is the process of a solid forming a solution in a solvent. The crystal lattice breaks down so 
that the constituent of the crystal (ions, atoms or molecules) are transported into the solvent. Dissolution is used in 
analytical chemistry, metal extraction from their ores, nuclear waste reprocessing, in the pharmaceutical industry, chemical 
engineering and biological processes. Fig. 5.1 shows dissolution in a simple diagrammatic fashion. 
Figure 5.1: Dissolution of a Solid Crystal in a Solvent. 
The dissolution of a solid in a solvent is frequently controlled by diffusion. If the concentration of the saturated solution is 
cs (a constant), then the concentration of the solid in solution, c, after a time t will be determined by the following integral. 
∫
c= 0
c= c
1
cs−c d c = k t
Where k is a constant that indicates how fast the solid dissolves. Integrate by substitution to find the concentration, c, as 
a function of time, t.

Question 2: Population of Diatomic Molecules in Rotational Quantum Levels
Molecules are always on the move and also they rotate and vibrate. Quantum mechanics dictates that the rotations and 
vibrations can only occur at certain frequencies. Fig. 5.2 shows the rotation of an HCl molecule around its centre of 
gravity (or centre of mass). 
Figure 5.2: Rotation of an HCl Molecule around its Centre of Gravity.
H = grey and Cl = green.
If you want to calculate the population of diatomic molecules, such as HCl, in the various rotational energy levels, you 
need to solve the following integral that defines something called the rotational partition function qr. 
qr = ∫

I is a constant for a give molecule (called the moment of inertia); h is Planck’s constant; kB is Boltzmann’s constant and T is 
the absolute temperature (constant at a fixed temperature). The rotational quantum number J can have only integer values 
of J = 0, 1, 2, 3 … (that’s the quantum mechanics bit). Although J is quantized and thus one would expect a summation 
to be used, the rotational energy levels are very closely spaced and so it is a very good approximation to use integration 
instead of summation (and it is easier). Integration is carried out over all possible J values from zero to the theoretical 
upper limit of infinity. 
Calculate this integral by using the substitution z = J(J + 1).

Question 3: Chemistry and Normalization of Wavefunctions 
The 1s orbital is the lowest electronic state of a hydrogen atom. The following radial probability distribution function, 
P = N r2 exp(−2r
a0)
describes the probability, P, of finding the electron at a distance, r, from the nucleus, with a0 being a constant (the Bohr 
radius or the most likely distance) and P is related to the square of the wavefunction. N is an unknown constant, the 
normalization constant, which ensures that the Maths equation above makes chemical common sense that the probability 
of finding the electron anywhere within the hydrogen atom must be 1. In mathematical notation this translates to the 
equation below. 
∫
r= 0
r= ∞ 
P d r = 1
The probability density function that satisfy this condition are said to be normalized. Determine the normalization constant 
and thus the normalized radial probability function P (we will need to use integration by parts twice to evaluate the integral).

are important in computational chemistry where computer packages are used to find solutions to the Schrödinger 
equation of molecular wavefunctions. Such computer programs model molecular structures, chemical reaction profiles and 
thermodynamic properties and are widely used in chemical and biological research both in industry and in universities, 
e.g. the structure and interactions of drug molecules. Since the exact molecular orbitals are highly complex, they are 
approximated by “Gaussian wavefunctions” that all contain the exponential exp(−ar2) multiplied by a polynomial rn which 
are much easier to integrate. The use of Gaussian functions leads to integrals such as those shown above. 
Calculate the above integrals using (a) the substitution method for I1 and (b) integration by parts for I2, and making use 
of the integral below, 
Jump to Solution 4 (see page 67)
5.1.5	
Question 5: Spectroscopy and Fourier Transform
Certain spectroscopic characterization methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance, infrared and Raman spectroscopies 
and some types of mass spectrometry give a spectrum of several peaks of various intensities at particular frequencies. 
This “normal” spectrum is called a frequency domain spectrum and consists of intensity, F, as a function of frequency, ω. 
The frequency domain spectrum is described by the mathematical equation F(ω) which can be recorded experimentally 
by scanning a wide range of frequencies. However, such a conventional scan may take some considerable time.
In many cases (magnetic resonance or infrared spectroscopy) it is more practical and takes a considerably shorter time to 
simply excite molecules with a pulse of a broad range of frequencies all at once and then measure the change of the total 
signal intensity with time t instead. This is called the time domain or free induction decay (FID) signal. This time domain 
signal usually happens within a few seconds and thus the data collection has been speeded up orders of magnitude compared 
with the classic frequency domain technique. Let us take the simplest case possible where the signal decays exponentially 
with time the measurement yields a time domain signal intensity f(t) proportional to e−at where a is a decay constant. 
The frequency domain spectrum F(ω), which is what the chemist needs to be able to understand the Chemistry of the 
molecule, is obtained from the time domain signal f(t) by a mathematical technique called a Fourier transform and 
requires the solution of the integral below. 
Note that the product of time t (units s) and frequency ω (units s−1) gives a dimensionless variable. For f (t) = exp(−at) 
find (using integration by parts twice) the solution of the integral shown below.

Question 6: Integrated Rate Law for a 2nd order Reaction with Two Reactants
For a reaction where two different compounds A and B react with each other, 
A + B →C + D
the rate of reaction, v, may depend on the concentrations of both A and B molecules (in which case the reaction is called 
a second-order reaction). An example is one of the atmospheric reactions that occur in the stratosphere for air that is 
polluted with chlorine containing molecules (both natural and man-made),
NO + Cl2 →NOCl + Cl
The molecule nitrosyl chloride is shown in Fig. 5.3.

 Figure 5.3: Nitrosyl Chloride Molecule. N = blue, O = red, Cl = green.
The rate of reaction, v, for a second-order reaction with two different reactants is, 
v = −d [A]
d t
= k [A][B]
The starting concentrations of reactants at time t = 0 being [A]0 mol L−1 for A and [B]0 mol L−1 for B and with no products 
C or D initially present. After a certain time t there will be x moles of C and D, our two products, while x moles of A 
and B will have been consumed. The kinetics of such a reaction describe the changes of concentration with time. In 
mathematical terms this leads to the following integrated rate law.

differentiate the substitution; and (3) rearrange to obtain a substitute for dc. 
z = cs−c
d z
dc = −1
dc = −d z
Note that the integral limits also must change when we make the substitution z = cs − c. The lower limit c = 0 becomes z

Let us choose for u and dv as

Figs.5.5 shows the time domain signal for a simple exponential decay of the sort we have been considering. Fig. 5.6 shows 
the intensity versus frequency domain spectrum after the Fourier transform for this decay signal. 
 Figure 5.5: Free Induction Decay (FID), Total Signal Intensity Versus Time.
Figure 5.6: Fourier Transformed Frequency Domain Spectrum, Intensity Versus Frequency.
Clearly in a real spectrum there would be many peaks each with their own intensity and the free induction decay would be 
very complex. The spectrometers that chemists commonly use have computer software which applies the above technique 
to the FID to obtain the “normal” or frequency spectrum.

we require the fractional product on the left hand side to be expressed as two separate fractions, that is we have to use

Don’t confuse the variables A and B (in italics and as yet unknown) and the chemical labels A and B (written in roman 
type). The identity, ≡, is true for all values of x whereas an equation is only true for certain values of x, called the solutions 
or roots of the equation. Bringing the two terms on the right of the identity to a common denominator gives,
1
([A]0 −x)([B]0 −x)
≡
A([B]0 −x)+ B([A]0 −x)
([A]0 −x)([B]0 −x)
To find the value of A we know that the identity is true for x = [A]0 which makes the second term in the right hand 
numerator zero. Thus the two numerators would become for x = [A]0 
1 = A([B]0 −[A]0)+ B([A]0 −[A]0)
A =
1
[B]0 −[A]0
The identity is also true for x = [B]0. Thus the two numerators would now become for x = [B]0 
1 = A([B]0 −[B]0)+ B([A]0 −[B]0)

This week's tutorials covers four topics: (1) area under a curve, (2) average value of a function, (3) length of curves and 
(4) the trapezium rule. All of these find applications in different areas of chemistry.

Question 1: Entropy Measurement of Solid Bismuth
How do we measure the entropy of a substance? It is relatively easy to measure the amount of heat required to raise the 
temperature of one mole of material by one degree Celsius, if this is measured at a constant pressure (for instance, one 
atmosphere) then it is called the heat capacity at constant pressure Cp. If you repeat these heat capacity measurements at 
a series of different temperatures then we can convert from heat capacity to entropy by the following method. 
Bismuth is a metal used in medicine, as an alloy for thermocouples, a nuclear reactor carrier for uranium, and in cosmetics. 
Bismuth’s heat capacity slowly increases with temperature, see Table 6.1.

Week 6: Chemical Applications of Integration
The change in entropy of a substance due to changing its temperature is given by the area under the curve of a graph of 
Cp /T against T, which in Maths is the integral of the curve between the two values of the x-axis.

T = T2 C p

Fig. 6.1 shows the plot for our data. 
 Figure 6.1: Cp /T versus T for Bismuth Metal.
Using our graphing spreadsheet the following third-order polynomial equation fits the curve from 100 to 200 K (but must 
not be extrapolated beyond that range). For clarity I have not included the units in this equation.

T = + 0.5505 −4.932× 10−3T + 2.050× 10−5T 2 −3.229× 10−8T 3

Question 2: The Average Distance from the Nucleus of an Electron in an Orbital
A second application of integration in chemistry is in the evaluation of the mean, or average, value of a quantity that 
changes continuously. Questions 2 and 3 are two examples in this use of integration.

where ao is the Bohr radius, equal to 0.5292 Å (Å is an angstrom = 10−10 m). The 1s atomic orbital is spherically symmetric, 
it only depends on the distance from the nucleus, r, and not on the angles of the polar coordinates. For a spherically 
symmetric orbital the average distance of the electron from the nucleus, symbol r pronounced “r bar” (averages are may 
also be written as <r> in some text books), is given by the integral, 
̄r = ∫
r= 0
r = ∞
4πr3(ψ 1 s)
2 d r
Substituting the radial wavefunction into the above integral (remembering that (ex)2 = e2x) gives us the integral we have 
to solve to find the average value of the distance of an electron from the nucleus for a 1s orbital. We will need to integrate 
by parts three times because of the r3 term,

Question 4: Trapezium Rule Integration of Cp Data to Calculate Entropy
Obtaining thermodynamic functions, such as the entropy, from experimental measurements often requires integrating a 
function numerically. One way to do this consists in remembering that the definite integral is the area under the curve 
and applying the trapezium rule. Alternatively, data can be fitted to a function and then integrated. Question 4 uses the 
trapezium rule and Question 5 fits a function to the same data. We may then compare the two methods.

Table 6.2: Solid Benzene Heat Capacity Data.
Assume that the heat capacity between 0 and 23 K is given by the Debye T 3 law which is, 
C p = a T 3
where a is a constant. Use the tabulated Cp value at 23 K to evaluate the constant, a, and then use an analytical integration 
from 0 to 23 K to find the entropy contribution from 0 to 23 K. 
To determine the entropy contribution from 23 to 272 K use the relationship,
S (23−273K) = ∫
T= 23
T= 273 C p
T
dT
from the tabulated values of (Cp /T ) against T apply the trapezium rule to numerically integrate from 23 to 273 K. The 
total entropy S of solid benzene at 273 K is then the sum of the two contributions 0-23 and 23-273 K.

Question 5: Integral as a Length of a Curve, Entropy from Heat Capacity
As seen in Question 4, the evaluation of the change in entropy when a thermodynamic system varies from a state with 
temperature T1 to a state with temperature T2 can be made through integration of experimental heat capacity data. The 
determination of the change in entropy, ∆S between T1 and T2, then the integral can be thought of as a length of a curve,

The heat capacity data of solid benzene reported in the Table 6.2 in Question 4 can be fitted using a polynomial, see Fig. 
6.3. The blue curve is a fourth-order polynomial fitted between 23 to 273 K.
 Figure 6.3: Solid Benzene Heat Capacity.
The data are reasonably accurately represented by the polynomial over the 23-273 K range. For clarity I have not included 
the units in this equation. 
C p = −9.792 + 1.202T −1.002× 10−2T 2 + 4.566× 10−5T 3 −6.807× 10−8T 4
A polynomial is very useful as it is a curve which fits the data over a given range of values but it does not give us any 
new chemical insight. However, polynomials functions are easy to integrate and differentiate. But what we cannot do is 
to extrapolate the polynomial function outside the limits of where it gives agreement with the experimental data. This is 
because it is not a “model” based equation, it is only a useful numerical fit. 
Determine the change in entropy, ΔS(23-273 K) when solid benzene is heated from 23 to 273 K and compare this result to the 
numerical integration of Solution 4.

S (0−23 K) = a× 4.056× 103 K 3
The constant a is determined by using the measured heat capacity at 23 K, which is Cp = 13.01 J K−1 mol−1, 
C p = aT 3
a = 13.01 J K−1 mol−1
(23 K)3
a = 1.069× 10−3 J K−4 mol−1
The entropy contribution up to 23 K is,
S (0−23K) = a× 4.056× 103 K 3 = (1.069× 10−3 J K−4  mol−1)(4.056× 103K 3)
Δ S(0−23 K) = 4.336 J K−1 mol−1
The entropy contribution from above 23 K is determined using the trapezium rule. Fig. 6.6 shows that the area under 
the blue curve between the limits of a particular “slice” is approximated by the sum of the areas of the rectangle and the 
triangle. The approximation becomes better the narrower we make the slice (i.e. the more data points we can measure), 
we then add the contributions from several slices to obtain the approximate area between wider limits. 
Figure 6.6: The Trapezium Rule.
The area of a trapezium is given below and derived in Fig. 6.6.
Area = (x2 −x1)(y 1 + y2)

Always draw a graph of the data to check whether you have made a simple error in processing the raw data or if there 
is a “rogue” experimental point which should either be ignored or remeasured. Our heat capacity data from Table 6.3 
is plotted in Fig. 6.7 as Cp /T against T. The advantage of the trapezium rule is that it ideal for spreadsheet evaluation.

±0.3 in 120 or ~0.3% which is pretty good. In this case the numerical trapezium rule had rather wide strips and hence 
would be expected to be less precise than the integral length of a curve method.

Probability theory provides the theoretical models and analytical tools for the organization, interpretation and analysis 
of experimental chemical data. It is also used in various branches of Chemistry to describe the collective behaviour of 
very large numbers of molecules or atoms. Also, by its very nature a wavefunction is related to the probability of finding 
a particle (an electron, atom, ion or molecule) in a certain position in space. These various aspects are covered in Week 
7 and Week 8. 
In order to obtain a measure of the expected spread of measurements (or reproducibility) of our experimental 
measurements, we calculate the standard deviation σy. Firstly, we consider how each data point varies from the mean of 
the data  (pronounced “y bar”). We calculate (yi − ) which is called the residual R of an individual data point and is 
the deviation of a given data yi point from the mean of the measurements, . 
R = (yi −̄y)
Squaring the residual has the effect of treating results which are less than the mean the same as those which are greater 
than the mean and is called the square of the residuals SR. 
SR = (yi −̄y)
2
The effect of the deviations from all the individual data points is measured by the sum of squares of the residuals SSR. 
SSR = ∑
i = 1

(yi −̄y)

The standard deviation of all the n data points is defined as, 
Often in Chemistry the result of a given experiment is calculated from one or more set of independent experimental 
measurements. The standard deviation of the result has to be computed from the known (or estimated) standard deviations 
of each variable using the error propagation formula. If the calculated quantity y is a function of a, b, c, …, that is, 
 y = f(a, b, c, …)

Perhaps the most important and one of the commonest tasks we face is fitting the best line to a graph from a lab experiment

Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) is an instrumental technique used for the quantitative determination of trace and 
ultra-trace levels of elements in a variety of samples. For example, measurement of various metals in water quality, food 
and in blood analysis. In scientific archaeology and forensic science the composition of trace elements of artefacts made 
from metal, pottery, or glass, gives information on their origins and ages. Fig. 7.1 shows a schematic diagram of the AAS 
instrument which you may use in your lab classes.

 Figure 7.1: Schematic AAS Instrument.
The atomizer is commonly a high temperature flame, or a hot graphite tube. Atoms absorb at specific wavelengths due 
to their quantum mechanics and hence the absorption at the chosen wavelength leads to a measure of the absorbance 
of that wavelength and eventually the Chemist can use the absorbance value to calculate the concentration of the atom. 
Chromium(VI) is one element which is known to be toxic to animals and plants. It is present in natural waters in sub-
trace level and its determination requires separation from the less toxic chromium(III) and pre-concentration. Absorbance 
values, which are pure numbers, obtained for Cr(VI) solutions using the chromium resonance line at λ = 357.9 nm are 
reported below. Three different samples of water were taken and measured by AAS and each sample was measured three

Question 2: Solubility Product and Error Propagation
Silver chloride AgCl is a white solid which is only very slightly soluble in water, 
AgCl(s) →

The solubility product, KS, is the equilibrium constant for the reaction of the solid dissolving in the solvent to its constituent 
ions.

KS =

co
[Cl−(aq)]

[AgCl (aq)]
co
Where each concentration is divided by its standard state, co, which is 1 mol L−1 for the solute ions, hence the units cancel 
out for the solutes. The standard state for any pure solid (e.g. AgCl) or any pure liquid, is unity and so a pure solid or pure 
liquid do not appear in the solubility product (or in an equilibrium constant). For instance, in our example of a saturated 
solution then adding more solid AgCl will not make the solution “more saturated” the added pure solid will just sit at the 
bottom of the solution along with the rest of the solid. So conventionally the solubility product is written as,
KS = [Ag+(aq)][Cl−(aq)]
but these are understood to be unit-less “concentrations” as the units have been cancelled out by division with the standard 
state. So a solubility product (or any equilibrium constant) is dimensionless. The solubility, S, has units of mol L−1 (as it 
is not divided by its standard state), and is defined as, 
S = [Ag+(aq)] and S = [Cl−(aq)]
Thus the solubility product for our AgCl saturated solution is written as KS = S 2. 
S = K S

Using the error propagation formula determine the solubility S, the standard deviation σS and the relative standard 
deviation σS / S in the calculated value of the solubility S of silver chloride AgCl knowing that its solubility product is Ks

Question 3: Wavefunctions and Probability
In quantum mechanics the particle in a box is used to model the translational motion of electrons, ions, atoms or molecules. 
We are going to use the model to estimate the transition energies in a conjugated molecule such as dye molecule. For 
example β-carotene is the red food pigment found in carrots and many other fruits and vegetables, see Fig. 7.2. It is red 
because of its conjugated double bond structure enables it to absorb at the blue end of the visible spectrum.

Week 7: Chemistry and Probability
Consider an electron confined to a molecule of length L = 1.0 nm (roughly five atoms long) and calculate the probability 
that when it is in the ground state (n = 1) the electron is found in the region between x = 0 and x = 0.2 nm.

Solution 1: Analysis of Traces by Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy
The average or mean of all 9 absorbances  is, 
̄y = 0.251555
I have deliberately used an excess number of significant figures at this intermediate stage so that later rounding errors are 
reduced. We will correct this situation later on in the solution. 
I used a hand calculator to calculate the values of the square of the residuals, SR, are shown in Table 7.2. but obviously 
for larger data sets we would use a spreadsheet.

Table 7.2: The Square of the Residuals, SR, for the AAS Absorbances.
The sum of these squares of the residuals is SSR = 7.0222×10−5 and thus the standard deviation is, 
σ y = 2.9627× 10−3
In your lab note book you would then quote your AAS measurements as,
AAS absorbance of Cr(VI) present in water samples = 0.252± 0.003
The result and the precision are both quoted to the same powers of ten and the first decimal place of the precision (rounded 
if necessary) determines the last decimal place of the result (also rounded as necessary).

Knowing the sensitivity of the AAS to the Cr(VI), i.e. the extinction coefficient at this wavelength, the analytical chemist 
would then calculate the concentration of the pollutant. As experimentalists, chemists are also interested in finding the 
relative standard deviation, that is comparing the standard deviation with the mean of the readings (i.e. how good is 
your experimental method and your equipment). The current reading are precise to about 1.2%. You could now change 
your experimental procedure and perhaps equipment to see whether the relative standard deviation can be improved or 
whether it deteriorates.

Where I have deliberately retained extra decimal places for the moment to reduce later rounding errors. This will be 
corrected when we have its standard deviation. The error propagation formula for this simple one independent variable 
problem means that the partial derivatives become full derivatives. For this one-variable case we may then take the square

Week 8 Tutorial Questions

Question 1: The Boltzmann Distribution and Quantum Energy Levels
The Boltzmann distribution allows us to determine the distribution of molecules amongst energy levels, that is their 
populations in the various quantum levels, Fig. 8.1. Don't confuse this quantum based Boltzmann distribution with the 
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution which deals with the non-quantized (or classical) translational motion of molecules. 
 Figure 8.1: Schematic Population of Molecules in Energy Levels.
If N represents the total number of molecules, then the number of molecules ni having energy εi with respect to the zero 
energy which is appropriate for that type of “motion”, is given by, 
ni
N =
exp(−
ε i
k BT)
∑
i
exp(−ε i
k BT)
Where kB is Boltzmann’s constant and the summation is over all the allowed quantum levels. 
Determine the expression for the number of molecules occupying level i relative to those in level j, that is find the 
population ratio ni /nj of molecules in the two different quantum levels i and j.

Question 2: Populations of Molecules in Translational, Rotational, Vibrational and Electronic 
Energy Levels
Let us consider a hydrogen molecule, H2, see Fig 8.2. 
 Figure 8.2: Hydrogen Molecule.
H2 molecules can undergo translational motion (movement of the whole molecule through space); rotational motion (the 
molecule rotates around the centre of mass); vibrational motion (the bond length increases and decreases); and electronic 
energy level changes. The energy differences, Δε, associated with the difference between the energies of the first excited 
(or upper level u), εu and the ground state εg, for translation, rotation, vibration and electronic energies are listed in Table 
8.1. Note that I have quoted the energy in J molecule−1 although this is strictly a non-SI unit (it should be J) it is very 
useful in reminding us that it is the energy per molecul

Table 8.1: Energy Gaps for the H2 Molecule.
H2 molecules in the gas phase at room temperature, T = 298 K, are undergoing collisions on average about every 10−10 s. 
These collisions can cause the H2 molecule to jump from its ground state to its first (and other) excited states, and also to 
lose energy and jump down a state. This may happen for each of the possible molecular motions listed in Table 8.1 and 
H2 will quickly reach a thermodynamic equilibrium of populations characteristic of its temperature of 298 K. 
Using these values for the energy gaps calculate the relative population nu /ng for the first excited state relative to the ground 
state, at room temperature T = 298 K, for each of the motions using your derived equation for the Boltzmann distribution 
of populations from Question 1. The Boltzmann constant is kB = 1.381×10−23 J K−1. (We are assuming no degeneracy of the 
levels, don’t worry about this simplification about degeneracy as it will be discussed later on in your Chemistry course.)

Question 3: Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution of Molecules
Translational motion of molecules may be treated as a classical non-quantized motion. The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution

and v+dv,
f (v) d v = 4π(

where kB is Boltzmann’s constant is kB = 1.381×10−23 J K−1. For argon gas (relative molar mass 39.95) which has a mass m 
= 6.636 10-26 kg, calculate the most probable speed, vmp, at 800 K, using the relationship
Secondly, estimate the fraction and the number of molecules per unit volume which have velocities which exceed the 
most probable speed by up to 1% given that the total number of molecules per unit volume is 9.00´1024 molecules cm−3. 
In this small dv range assume that f (v) is constant.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

For translational motion we obtain,
translational motion nu
ng
= exp(−
4.918× 10−41 J
1.381× 10−23 J K−1× 298 K)= 1
The energy gap for translational motion is negligibly small compared to the size of kBT = 4.115×10−21 J at 298 K, which is 
a measure of the average thermal energy per molecule. There are, to a very good approximation, equal populations in the 
first excited and the ground translational energy levels. The value of the translational energy gap for H2 was calculated 
using the energy of a particle in a box and making the box have sides of 1 metre, a macroscopic or normal sized container 
for the gas. 
In fact the particle in a box energy gap is so small for molecules in macroscopic containers that we may very safely treat 
them classically, that is as if they are not quantized. This is the whole basis behind the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution 
of translational velocities which we have met previously. 
rotational motion nu
ng
= exp(−
4.805× 10−21 J
1.381× 10−23 J K−1× 298 K)= 0.3111
The energy gap for the rotational motion of H2 (the end-over-end rotation around the molecule’s centre of mass, in this 
case the middle of the H−H bond) is similar to the average thermal energy. There are about 31 molecules in the excited 
rotational level for every 100 molecules in the ground rotational level. 
vibrational motion nu
ng
= exp(−
8.2605× 10−20 J
1.381× 10−23 J K−1× 298 K)= 1.917× 10−9
The H2 bond vibrates in and out around its average equilibrium bond length and the energy gap to the excited vibrations 
level (which has a larger amplitude of vibrational motion) is ten times larger than the average thermal energy. A negligible 
fraction of H2 molecules are in the excited vibrational level at 298 K, to a very good approximation all the H2 molecules 
are in in their ground vibrational level at 298 K.

The thermal population of the first excited electronic state of H2 is zero to a very large number of significant figures. This 
arises from the electronic gap being about 400 times larger than the average thermal energy for H2. A similar situation 
occurs for most other molecules.

Solution 3: Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution of Molecules
The most probable speed is given by,
v mp = 577.0 m s−1
We have replaced the named unit joule by its fundamental units of J = kg m2 s−2. The most probable speed of 577 m s−1 
is an enormous speed and is typical of molecules. Remember, that molecules only travel on average short distances due 
to rapid collisions with other molecules about every 10−10 s. 
Secondly, we are interested in calculating the fraction of molecules whose velocity ranges between 577.0 m s-1 and 577.0 
+ 5.77 = 582.8 m s-1 using the equation, 
f (v) d v = 4π(
m
2 πk BT)
3/2
exp(−m v2
2k BT)v 2 d v
If f (v) is assumed to be constant in the range v to v+dv we have the following (split over 2 lines for clarity).
f (v) d v = 4π(
6.636× 10−26 kg
2π× 1.381× 10−23 J K−1× 800 K)

f (v) d v = 4π(9.347× 10−10 m−3s3)(0.3679)(1.921× 106 m3s−3)
f (v) d v = 8.301× 10−3
The fraction of molecules with velocity between 577.0 m s-1 and 582.8 m s-1 is f (v) = 0.008301 or 0.83%. From this we can 
calculate the number of molecules by multiplying f (v) by the total number of molecules Ntot.

Molecules again is not an SI unit but it is a very useful reminder for us. Although the fraction of molecules is small the 
absolute number of molecules in this velocity range is enormous. Fig. 8.4 shows the area between the most probable 
velocity vmp and vmp + (0.01 vmp) as a blue shaded area.
