ADVANCE PRAISE FOR MASTERING DIGITAL BUSINESS:
‘Nicholas Evans is a magician, weaving together the complexities of the digital world into a 
tapestry of opportunities for alert companies and managers. And like a good magician, he 
makes it look easy. Get started on your digital transformation with this book NOW.’
Henry Chesbrough, professor at UC Berkeley Haas School of Business, and 
author, Open Innovation: The New Imperative for Creating and 
Profiting from Technology
‘The digital transformation, based on vast data from cheap sensors and cloud intelligence, 
will enable new business models, new strategies, and new empires in all industries. Using 
insight and case studies, Mastering Digital Business does a superb job guiding us through 
the changes coming, and helping us think through not only new product and logistics strate­
gies, but how management itself must evolve to thrive in the coming decades.’
R. Preston McAfee, Chief Economist, Microsoft
‘By their very nature, transformations require disruptive changes. Digital transformations 
require companies to be in a state of constant change. Mastering Digital Business shows 
that successful digital transformation goes beyond leading edge technology to include dis­
ruptive business models, redesigned processes, and – most importantly – cultural change.’
Jonathan Becher, Chief Digital Officer, SAP
‘Mastering Digital Businesses is a highly topical book and a must read for both business 
and IT executives looking to come out on top by leveraging disruptive technologies. Nick is a 
brilliant writer and in this book he combines case studies with in-depth analysis to provide 
valuable insights for digital leaders. The importance for traditional players to swiftly move 
towards a more agile and flexible digital environment while blending the "new" with the "old" 
can’t be understated and Nick takes the reader through a straightforward thought process 
for how to do this successfully.’
Robert Eriksson, Head of Engineering, Digital and Transformation, 
Lloyds Banking Group
‘Much talk is happening about digital transformation and innovation. Rarely does this talk 
cover pragmatic steps regarding how to "make sense" and "take action" on the new oppor­
tunities that today’s most disruptive technologies catalyze. Nick’s book does that – providing 
“blueprints for action” – helping those who take advantage of Nick’s insights move from 
conceptual discussions to pragmatic action, with speed and scale. Of particular value is his 
distillation of patterns – or what he calls “palette” – of options of which technologies to use 
in which combination to take advantage of different business opportunities.’
Ralph Welborn, CEO, Imaginatik
‘With 52% of the Fortune 500, merged, acquired, gone bankrupt, or fallen off the list since 
2000, the digital revolution has transformed business models. Leaders need pragmatic 
advice from strategy to execution on digital transformation. Nicholas’ book Mastering Digital 
Business provides practitioners with not only the first principles required to succeed but 
also a pragmatic approach to addressing the change management requirement for success 
in decoding digital business.’
R. “Ray” Wang, Principal Analyst and Founder, Constellation Research

‘Mastering Digital Business is a real wakeup call. For company leaders willing to see, react 
to and foresee the signals of change, this is a must-read manual.’
Sanjay Sarma, Professor of Mechanical Engineering, MIT
‘In today’s world, successful organisations recognise that technology is a force which 
makes scarce resources abundant. And those same organisations have put technology 
capability at the heart of business strategy. Nicholas D. Evans’ book goes beyond the theory 
of the digital disruption which is impacting our lives, and provides business leaders with 
compelling, practical advice for redesigning our organisations, strategies, environments, 
and workforce to not only compete but to thrive in an age of ever increasing complexity and 
technical innovation. Read it. Then share it with your team!’
Stephen Foreshew-Cain, COO, Co-op Digital and former Executive Director, UK 
Government Digital Service
‘Nicholas has managed to take the world of innovation and digital transformation and make 
it simple enough to understand at all levels within the business, which is no mean feat. The 
book covers a number of insights and strategies that will allow c-level execs and techies 
alike to decode the transformation of businesses in the digital age.’
Matt Harris, Head of IT, Mercedes AMG Petronas Formula One Team
‘Mastering Digital Business is fundamentally about innovation. Whether you want new 
products, services, processes, or business models, this book can help jump start business 
growth through tapping into the power of digital business.’
Soren Kaplan, bestselling and award winning author of The Invisible Advantage
‘Digital disruption is THE business issue! Leaders need to be armed with how to think about 
this to succeed in the future. Evans provides straightforward recipes to navigate through 
this important transition.’
Mark Sherman, Managing Director, Telstra Ventures

INTRODUCTION
Today, chief executive officers (CEOs) worldwide are applying digital transformation to 
re-think and re-design their traditional, existing business models and processes in the 
context of new disruptive technologies, digitally savvy consumers, ubiquitous comput­
ing and our globally connected society. This notion of digitisation is now affecting all 
aspects of business operations from innovation within and around actual products and 
services, to customer engagement, to the digital workplace, to business models and 
processes – and no industry is exempt.
The goal of this book is to provide a strategic guide for business and IT executives, 
applying today’s most disruptive technologies (including social, mobile, analytics and 
cloud (SMAC) technologies, plus wearables, intelligent automation, robotics and the 
Internet of Things) in powerful combinations, together with platform business models, 
a mastery of digital services and leading practices in corporate innovation, to help you 
develop and execute your digital strategies for competitive advantage. 
The issue for business and IT executives is that ‘digital disruption’ is here, and is 
impacting all industries. The challenge is how will you respond – both today and 
tomorrow?
The big idea is that the book introduces a reference model and blueprint for decoding 
how leading players – including Uber and many others – have launched new digital 
disruptions within their target markets by applying eight powerful combinations of 
disruptive technology underpinned by the power of the platform and a mastery of 
digital services.
It then shows how to apply the model towards four key transformational business 
objectives: enhancing the digital customer experience, transforming the digital 
workplace, gaining insights from analytics, and optimizing digital infrastructure and 
simplifying management – with a futuristic vision for each.

MASTERING DIGITAL BUSINESS
THE BUSINESS NEED
The book aims to provide a fresh, new approach to digital business strategy and execu­
tion, which describes how the next wave of emerging and disruptive technologies can 
be applied in powerful combinations to establish an agile new platform ecosystem for 
digital business. 
This new platform enables organisations to create a highly virtualised, highly distributed, 
ecosystem of on-demand services providing a palette of options for specific digital 
business outcomes. Organisations can select the appropriate sub-set of building blocks, 
in the form of disruptive technologies, based on their target business outcomes. 
While many books on ‘digital business’ focus solely on the digital customer experience, 
this book aims to provide a more in-depth, well-rounded picture with strategies and 
techniques for how to re-think and re-design business models and processes, how 
to transform the digital workplace by ‘instrumenting the human’ and ‘socializing the 
machine’, how to leverage insights from analytics to improve operational efficiencies 
and competitive advantage and how to apply intelligent automation to optimise infra­
structure and simplify management. 
The book goes beyond the commonly cited examples of tech giants such as Amazon, 
Netflix and Uber, and beyond the commonly cited business scenarios for each disruptive 
technology, to explore and unlock powerful new forms of business value in the years 
ahead. It provides a reference model for decoding how leading players have launched 
new digital disruptions within their target markets at the industry level, business model 
level and process level by applying powerful combinations of disruptive technology – 
with clear examples of each. In addition, it provides an actionable roadmap in terms of 
how to time your move, based on technology maturity, and how to take an agile journey 
to the future platform for digital business.
Another unique aspect of the book is that it explores how leaders can utilise the latest 
corporate innovation techniques to spur collaboration and prioritise opportunities based 
on business impact and ease of implementation. It shows precisely how existing corpo­
rate innovation programmes can be adapted and fine-tuned to most effectively support 
digital transformation both now and in the years to come.
The net result is that you will have a strategic guide for the next wave of digital 
transformation, which will help you to develop and execute your digital strategies for 
competitive advantage using the most advanced approaches to innovation and the latest 
disruptive technologies where the sum is far greater than the parts. 
While many have written about discrete technologies, this is the first book that 
truly decodes digital business at the strategy level and which shows how powerful 
combinations of disruptive technologies, together with platform business models and a 
mastery of digital services, are enabling breakthrough results. 
STRUCTURE OF THIS BOOK
The book provides a four-part framework from strategy to execution with unique, new 
reference models and blueprints, together with industry case studies, and practical

MASTERING DIGITAL BUSINESS
CONVENTIONS
In terms of conventions, there are a number of techniques used in this book to help 
you quickly find information, examples, case studies and key takeaways. Tables are 
frequently used to provide key facts, definitions of terms, concise examples of business 
benefits and industry scenarios. Company examples and case studies are provided 
within the main text of each chapter, in the context of the discussion, to help illustrate 
the points being made. In-depth case studies, which can be considered ‘feature’ case 
studies, are labelled ‘Case study’ and are highlighted within a shaded text box to make 
them clearly visible. These are typically self-standing and can be read at any time. Key 
takeaways are presented at the end of each chapter to help summarise the key points 
and lessons learned within the chapter, and to highlight any key approaches, techniques 
or models that might be useful in your own planning. 
TARGET AUDIENCE
The target audience for the book is business executives and leaders, in both large 
and mid-size organisations, wishing to exploit disruptive technologies together with 
leading innovation management approaches within their business for digital transfor­
mation, continual growth, profits and relevancy, and to keep ahead of the competition. 
The book is particularly suited for executives and leaders – from the C-suite to 
managers – who need a strategic guide to help shape and inform their digital business 
vision and direction. This applies equally well to any leader or manager who wears a 
strategy ‘hat’ in his or her role – including line-of-business leaders in areas such as 
product and service development, marketing, customer service and support, supply 
chain and operations, as well as IT leaders – and those in dedicated strategy positions 
within the organisation. 
The secondary audience is technology providers, start-ups, professional services com­
panies, venture capitalists and investors, government policy makers, educational insti­
tutions and students, industry analysts and industry associations.

DESIGNING YOUR DIGITAL BUSINESS 
STRATEGY AND VISION
Software is eating the world.
Marc Andreessen1
In this chapter, we’ll explore the art of the possible with regard to digital business, why 
it’s so disruptive to traditional business models, and how to prepare for disruption in 
your industry. We’ll also look at some industry examples, such as smart parking, where 
new digitally based business models can not only disrupt their target markets but can 
be quickly expanded into market adjacencies.
In terms of the art of the possible, due to the ‘digital medium’ these new business 
models are designed to operate in, they have the intrinsic potential to be more trans­
formative than they would appear from the outside. By digitising a traditionally analogue 
business model or process, we’re effectively turning it into bits and atoms and enabling 
an infinite variety of possibilities. 
In terms of exploring why digital business is so disruptive to traditional business models 
and traditional notions of industry competition, we’ll analyse the situation by looking at 
Porter’s model of the five forces of industry competition and exploring how digital busi­
ness is impacting each of the various forces. 
Finally, in terms of how to prepare for digital disruption, we’ll explore some of the signs 
to watch out for and how to prepare your response. By its very nature, a disruption is 
extremely hard to predict. Still, with careful analysis of industry trends, a keen grasp of 
the art of the possible and observations of recent ‘seismic activity’, you can get a sense 
of what to prepare for and how to react. 
THE ART OF THE POSSIBLE: THE HIDDEN DISRUPTION OF DIGITAL 
BUSINESS MODELS
Digital transformation is being applied by CEOs worldwide to re-think and re-design their 
traditional, existing business models and processes in the context of today’s disruptive 
technologies, the consumerisation of IT, ubiquitous low-cost computing and our globally 
connected society. It’s my belief that many of these new, social-, mobile-, analytics- and 
cloud-enabled (that is, SMAC-enabled) digital business models have the intrinsic poten­
tial to be more transformative than they would first appear from the outside.

MASTERING DIGITAL BUSINESS
One of the interesting questions often raised in regard to digital transformation initia­
tives is actually how ‘transformational’ the initiative really is.
Does the initiative truly create transformational change to the business 
model, process, product or service, or is it more of an incremental 
value-add? 
First, this is a great question to ask of all of your digital initiatives. In essence, it is a 
litmus test to uncover the degree of change that’s anticipated, or already experienced, 
from deployment of your digital initiative. As the sponsor behind the initiative, or perhaps 
one of several stakeholders, you’ll know right away from your digital strategy the degree 
of change you’re aiming for. As you look across your portfolio of projects, it’s likely that 
some will be closer to the ‘transformational’ bar and others will be deliberately more 
‘incremental’, but still intended to yield specific forms of measurable business value. 
This ‘degree of transformation’ discussion is very much akin to the kinds of discussions 
I have with customers when conducting innovation workshops. In our particular form of 
these workshops, we encourage innovative ideas of all kinds: from strategic, and highly 
disruptive, ‘change the business’ types of ideas all the way to more tactical, incremen­
tal ideas. The idea with these particular workshops is that all ideas, from strategic to 
tactical, have initial merit and should be captured. As long as they’re aligned with the 
key focus areas of the workshop, determined ahead of time with the workshop spon­
sors, and are intended to add business value, then let’s go ahead and capture them for 
subsequent discussion and prioritisation.
As a sponsor or stakeholder you likely know the degree of transformation inherent in 
your initiative based upon your strategy, but what about the outside industry observer, 
customer or partner? As highlighted earlier, it’s my belief that due to the ‘digital medium’ 
these new business models are designed to operate in, they have the intrinsic potential 
to be more transformative than they would appear from the outside. 
As discussed, by digitising a traditionally analogue business model or process, we’re 
effectively turning it into bits and atoms and enabling an infinite variety of possibilities. 
The rules can be whatever you want them to be – with the market being the petri dish 
to determine if the new rules are viable and can lead to adoption and growth. 
CASE STUDY – STREETLINE 
A smart parking example
A good example of the hidden disruption of digital business models – in terms of the 
hidden degree of transformational change – is smart parking. At first glance, it’s just a 
way to find a parking spot. Wireless sensors are embedded in parking spaces to detect 
whether the space is occupied or not. Data from each sensor is relayed to the cloud 
and then real-time parking data is published via a mobile app on the smartphone, so 
drivers can find open parking spots and gain access to additional data and analytics.
In terms of enabling technologies for digital business, it’s a great SMAC example, 
because it has all the elements of social, mobile, analytics and cloud. But is it really icon

doing anything more than giving directions to drivers on their mobile device so they can 
find open parking spaces in the city? Surely that’s just an incremental value-add, and 
hardly transformative. It’s just going to save me a few minutes in finding a parking spot. 
When you take an in-depth look at smart parking, however, you’ll find some truly trans­
formational aspects to the digital business model – what you might call some ‘hid­
den disruptions’. First, smart parking has obvious benefits for drivers, but it also has 
transformational aspects for cities and also for the transportation industry as a whole.
In addition to being a $25 billion industry that’s seen little innovation in decades, park­
ing is essentially a real estate play for cities. It’s typically the second or third source of 
revenue for the city as a whole. Any business model or process change that can improve 
parking revenues, reduce time spent looking for parking, reduce traffic congestion and 
reduce pollution can yield substantial benefits to the local city and economy.

Today, according to Streetline,2 there are approximately 2 billion parking spaces in the 
US. A total of 70 million hours are spent each year looking for parking, which repre­
sents a $1 billion loss to the economy. In addition, 30% of city drivers are looking for 
parking and this adds about 10% to the average vehicle’s CO2 emissions. 
Smart parking systems enable cities to better understand parking behaviour and make 
policy changes that can improve conditions. This might include changes such as park­
ing hours of operation, parking time limits or even demand-based pricing. The result 
is that smart parking can enable cities to increase revenue by up to 20–30% and cities 
can achieve a return on investment (ROI) in one to two years.

MASTERING DIGITAL BUSINESS
Recent case studies have shown that sales tax revenues increased by 11.9%, a 30% 
reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, a 10% reduction in traffic, and an increase of 
2% in local GDP. Reducing traffic and parking congestion improves commerce by mak­
ing cities more accessible for all involved. 
In the UK, Streetline is working with major cities such as Birmingham and Manchester. 
The City of Birmingham, which has over 1 million residents combined with 160,000 
commuters, is using Streetline wireless parking sensors and applications to see 
trends including hourly occupancy, occupancy by block and parking duration. Man­
chester City Council has collaborated with Streetline to launch the motorist guidance 
app Parker™ in Manchester’s vibrant Northern Quarter and Chinatown areas to pre­
vent circling and increase foot traffic to local merchants.
So today, I’d argue there’s a strong business case for smart parking with transforma­
tional levels of benefit – that is, beyond single digit percentage improvements and into 
the 10%-plus range. When we look ahead to extensions of this business model into 
smart cities, intelligent transportation networks and connected cars, that’s when things 
get even more interesting. Is smart parking really just about parking or is it about digit­
ising and connecting the physical world to enable a wide range of new business models 
and associated services? That is, the start of an Internet of Things (IoT) play. 
What happens when smart parking systems get integrated into an ecosystem of 
other IoT devices within a city, such as air quality, lighting, water pressure and even 
garbage cans? 
The result is opportunities for smart city operations and services to become highly 
responsive, pro-active and even predictive based on digitally observed changes in the 
real-world environment. Sensors used for one purpose may also be re-tasked or multi-
tasked to serve other city purposes as well. For example, smart parking sensors that 
include temperature sensors can be used to measure road surface temperature and 
pro-actively know when salt trucks or snow removal trucks should be dispatched. 
What happens when smart parking systems get integrated into the connected car? 
In the near future, the result may be that your digital assistant, accessible from any 
device including your car, can share your schedule with relevant merchants via the 
smart parking ecosystem so they can reserve prime parking for you a couple of min­
utes ahead of your scheduled arrival time. This and hundreds other personalised 
services that you’ll access via your mobile and your connected car will make this intel­
ligent ecosystem very ‘sticky’ in terms of the services provided. Early entrant service 
providers and merchants will build highly personalised and curated experiences for 
their customers, which may be hard for later entrants to unseat. 
Just as Amazon digitised the book selling industry and Netflix the movie rental industry, 
transportation is an example of one of the next, many industry areas to go digital. When 
the IoT is part of this business model as well it opens up even more possibilities for 
hidden disruption, since we’re digitising the physical world and instrumenting people, 
10

DESIGNING YOUR DIGITAL BUSINESS STRATEGY AND VISION
assets and infrastructure. This has the potential to radically change how people work 
and live, since it moves us into an era of instant digital experiences, interactions and 
transactions underpinned by intelligent consumption of resources.
In summary, digital business models are highly attractive because they have so many 
future directions they can take and the opportunity for business model and busi­
ness process innovation is wide open. The potential for transformational change is 
particularly strong when going from a totally analogue business model to a highly 
digitised one. 
ANALYSING THE DISRUPTION: HOW DIGITAL DISRUPTS THE FIVE FORCES 
OF INDUSTRY COMPETITION
Exactly why is digital business so disruptive to traditional business models 
and traditional notions of industry competition? 
A useful way to analyse the situation is by looking at Porter’s model of the five forces 
of industry competition and exploring how digital business is impacting each of the 
various forces.
In one of his landmark books, titled Competitive strategy,3 Michael E. Porter describes 
the five forces of industry competition as the entry of new competitors, the threat of 
substitutes, the bargaining power of buyers, the bargaining power of suppliers, and the 
rivalry among existing competitors. The Five Forces Model has long been used by cor­
porate strategists to think about the rules of competition and the respective headwinds 
and tailwinds produced as a company operates and produces products or services in 
this external environmental context. 
Traditionally, strategists would develop approaches to minimise the headwinds and 
maximise the tailwinds associated with each force. For example, the threat of new 
entrants could be minimised by creating strong barriers to entry in terms of patents 
and other rights, large economies of scale, product differentiation, strong customer loy­
alty and high switching costs. As another example, the threat of substitute products or 
services could be minimised by creating a higher level of differentiation or better price 
performance when compared to competitive offerings.
Digital business is impacting each of these traditional forces and essentially levelling 
the playing field to the point where new entrants can rush in with far fewer barriers to 
entry. In fact, these new players may well have a competitive advantage over incum­
bents, even from day one, simply by having a digitally based business model.
In some cases, not only is digital disruption coming to various industries via the free 
market economy, it is also being regulated into effect. Take for example, the Revised 
Directive on Payment Services (PSD2) which is designed to create safer and more 
innovative European payments. PSD2 is having a highly disruptive effect on the finan­
cial services industry because it requires banks to open up access to customer's 
online accounts and payment services to third party providers. Banks are therefore 
11

being forced to re-think their business models and the very ecosystems in which they 
operate.
Table 1.2 provides a listing of the traditional five forces together with a summary of how 
the new digital threat (i.e. the threat of digital disruption) is impacting these traditional 
forces – creating both threats and opportunities – and the rationale for how and why 
digital is making such a transformational impact.

1. The entry of new competitors
There’s no doubt that digital business is changing the nature of competition. Today, it’s 
not just traditional industry competitors you need to worry about, but new entrants from 
outside your industry, equipped with new digitally based business models and value 
propositions. 
This is often tech giants and start-ups that have envisioned and built a new business 
model from the ground up, powered by a new platform ecosystem for digital business. 
They’re leveraging the familiar SMAC technologies, but are often adding in personas and 
context, intelligent automation, the IoT and cyber security to further enhance the value 
proposition of their platform. 
In effect, tomorrow’s leader may not be someone you know. We often think of industry 
competition as a perpetual battle between the same set of incumbents, but in reality 
things are far more dynamic and transitory. As an example, whereas 89 per cent of the 
Fortune 500 went out of business between 1955 and 2014,4 in recent years, according 
to R. ‘Ray’ Wang of Constellation Research, 52 per cent has been merged, acquired, gone 
bankrupt or fallen off the list since 2000.5
Why can new entrants move in so easily? Digital business changes the rules by lower­
ing the traditional barriers to entry. A digitally based business model requires far less 
capital and can bring large economies of scale for example. 
2. The threat of substitutes 
The threat of substitutes has to do with the threat of substitute products or services. In 
terms of digital business, this can come from a purely digital substitute or a hybrid digital/
physical substitute. Taxi services, such as Uber and EasyTaxi, for example, provide a hybrid 
model via a digital app for consumers and taxi drivers, coupled with the physical taxis. 
Digital services wrapped around a physical product are another example and can range 
from one extreme such as the Industrial Internet, to another such as home automation 
technologies or personal fitness products. In addition, the long-term revenue stream from 
the digital services may be worth far more than the one-time sale of the physical product. 
13

MASTERING DIGITAL BUSINESS
The threat of substitutes is high in many industries, since switching costs are low and 
buyer propensity to substitute is high. In the taxi services example, customers can easily 
switch from traditional models to the new model simply by installing an app on their 
smartphone.
Propensity to switch from the traditional model is high due to consumer wait times for 
taxis, lack of visibility into taxi location and so on. 
3. The bargaining power of buyers 
Perhaps the strongest of the five forces impacting industry competition is the bargain­
ing power of buyers, since the biggest driver of digital business comes from the needs 
and expectations of consumers and customers themselves. 
This bargaining power lays out a new set of expectations for the digital customer 
experience and necessitates continual corporate innovation across business models, 
processes, operations, products and services. 
Customers and consumers have amassed far more bargaining power today due to 
instant access to information, insights from social media (including access to reviews 
and feedback), low switching costs via digital channels, price sensitivity, access to 
substitute products and services with greater ease of use and convenience, as well as 
increased industry competitiveness as a result of the other forces. 
4. The bargaining power of suppliers 
Suppliers can accelerate or slow down the adoption of a digitally based business 
model, based upon how it impacts their own situation. Those pursuing digital models 
themselves, such as using application programming interfaces (APIs) to streamline 
their ability to form new partnerships and manage existing ones, may help to accelerate 
your own model. 
Those who are suppliers to the traditional models, and who question or are still 
determining their new role in the digital equivalent, may use their bargaining power to 
slow down or dispute the validity or legality of the new model. 
Good examples are the legal and business issues surfacing around the digital-sharing 
economy (i.e. ride-sharing, room-sharing etc.), where suppliers and other constituents 
work to ensure that the business model and process innovations still adhere to 
established rules, regulations, privacy, security and safety. This is a positive and needed 
development since, coupled with bargaining power of buyers, it can help to keep new 
models ‘honest’ in terms of how they operate. 
5. The rivalry among the existing competitors 
Finally, existing competitors are all looking at digital business – trying to understand the 
disruptions occurring and prepare their response. The responses can range all the way 
from defensive to offensive measures, and even a first-mover attack. This rivalry among 
competitors is always in play, but in recent years digital business has added fuel to the 
fire, just as the ebusiness era did many years ago. 
14

DESIGNING YOUR DIGITAL BUSINESS STRATEGY AND VISION
The rivalry is heating up because entry and exit barriers are going down due to the 
comparative low cost of digital business models, and in many cases new entrants do not 
even need to own physical assets or infrastructure. In particular, the ‘platform’ model is 
seeing considerable success in the marketplace by simply connecting stakeholders and 
applying a set of peripheral services to enhance the customer experience. 
By doing so, platform operators are moving to the forefront of service delivery and 
getting closer to the customer without even owning assets or having employees working 
in that particular industry. According to a recent article in The Guardian, 
Today, any service provider, and even content provider, risks becoming hostage 
to the platform operator, which, by aggregating all those peripherals and stream­
lining the experience of using them, suddenly moves from the periphery to the 
centre.6
Overall, as you prepare your various digital business initiatives, the five forces frame­
work can be a useful way to think about the various headwinds and tailwinds acting on 
your envisioned model and how various constituents may react. In combination with the 
usual value chain analysis, it can help to inform your strategy and provide some useful 
insights into what you may encounter along the way.
PREPARING FOR THE DIGITAL DISRUPTION THAT’S COMING TO YOUR 
INDUSTRY
Whatever your business, significant disruption is either already occurring or on the way. 
Much of this is due to the latest wave of emerging and disruptive technologies that are 
serving as foundational building blocks for new, digitally based business models. 
In talking with a number of CEOs and business leaders, all of them are keen to glimpse 
around the corner to prepare for what’s ahead. Even if your business is going strong 
right now, you should be doing the same. To help you in this task, here are a few thoughts 
that arose from those discussions. 
Understanding the disruption
By its very nature, a disruption is extremely hard to predict. Still, with careful analysis 
of industry trends, a keen grasp of the art of the possible, and observations of recent 
Figure 1.1  Preparing for digital disruptionFigure 1.1
15

MASTERING DIGITAL BUSINESS
‘seismic activity’, you can get a sense of what to prepare for in terms of ‘who’, ‘what’, 
‘where’, ‘when’ and ‘how’ (Figure 1.1).
1. Identify the likely players and their tactics
This is not always as easy as it sounds, since a competitor can come out of nowhere. 
Take as an example Apple Pay and its effect on the mobile payments industry. This was 
a case of a technology giant leveraging its cash flow and vast customer base and using 
disruptive technologies to poach on territory where it had never before set foot. Apple’s 
limited industry knowledge was offset by its millions of customers, its eagerness to 
partner with major industry players to become relevant in the industry and its ability to 
continually turn on new services for customers. 
Here’s the thing, though: if you’re in the payments industry, you’ve known for a long time 
that digital payments were coming. Your preparation for that day should have included 
the recognition that a company like Apple, with a mastery of digital services, could make 
a play. In Chapter 2, ‘Re-thinking and re-designing your business models and processes’, 
we’ll take a more in-depth look at the digital business strategy moves behind Apple’s 
entry into mobile payments via its Apple Pay service. 
2. Understand the magnitude
A disruption can happen at the industry level, the business model level or the process 
level. But be aware that a process disruption can bubble up in scale and affect both 
business models and entire industries. Just think of what happened to travel agents 
when a process change (booking travel on the internet) nearly eliminated their role. 
We’ll also explore this aspect in Chapter 2 in terms of the various pathways for re-think­
ing and re-designing business processes for a more agile enterprise and a transformed 
user experience.
3. Have a vision for what the disruption may look like
The disruption could be a technology-driven disruption such as 3D printing, or a 
competitive disruption in the form of new entrants with digitally based business models, 
processes, products or services. Within the transportation industry, for example, 3D 
printing is expected to threaten up to 41 per cent of air cargo and up to 37 per cent of 
ocean container shipments7 as the technology starts to enable locally manufactured 
products and lessen the need for shipments overseas. Chapter 3, ‘Maximising the poten­
tial of today’s disruptive technologies for digital business’, explores the various emerg­
ing and disruptive technologies that are coming together to serve as the foundational 
building blocks for disruptions in the form of new, digitally enabled business models, 
processes, products and services. 
Another way to get a sense of what future disruptions may look like is to craft a 
vision for your industry or to look at those already under development. The German 
‘Industry 4.0’ vision for the future of manufacturing is an example, as is GE’s vision of 
the Industrial Internet. Chapter 4, ‘The new platform ecosystem for digital business’, 
explores how the visions of Industry 4.0 and the Industrial Internet are built upon the 
new platform for digital business (i.e. the foundational technology building blocks) and 
additionally explores the impact of digital business ecosystems and platforms, which 
are fast becoming the dominant go-to-market business model. 
16

DESIGNING YOUR DIGITAL BUSINESS STRATEGY AND VISION
4. Have a sense of the disruption’s timing
To prepare your response and time your move, it’s key to estimate when these events 
will affect you. Is this something you need to act on immediately or something you 
should continue to monitor closely? Either way, it’s good to have a strategic plan and 
weigh all the response scenarios. 
Having a good sense of the timing of these disruptions is important not only to help 
you respond accordingly, but also to help you understand how technology maturity can 
enable different business opportunities. As emerging technologies are adopted in the 
enterprise, much like surfing, there are generally three waves you can catch along the 
way. A particular trend in pioneer or early adopter status needs to be handled quite dif­
ferently from when it has progressed into the early majority, or even the late majority. 
The kinds of benefits you can expect to obtain are quite different as well.
If we take blockchain technology as an example, with blockchain (the distributed ledger 
technology behind Bitcoin that lets people who do not know or trust each other build a 
record of who owns what at any point in time) currently in the first ‘emerging wave’, there’s 
strong potential for business model transformation for pioneers who are willing to take the 
risk. If your organisation is more conservative, you can wait for the second ‘differentiating 
wave’ to extract competitive advantage as an early adopter, or the third ‘business value 
wave’ to extract proven business value as part of the early majority. In Chapter 7, ‘Timing 
your move based on technology maturity’, we’ll explore this topic in more detail so you have 
an in-depth understanding of the business benefits and the pros and cons of entering the 
market with these types of emerging technologies at different times as they mature. 
5. Understand what the disruption can do to your industry’s value chain
In most industries, a highly likely play will be to get closer to your customers by offering 
a radically different way of doing business that’s faster, simpler and cheaper. In Chapter 
8, ‘Enhancing the digital customer experience’, we’ll explore some of the keys to success 
and the strategies around creating new, digitally based value propositions to get closer 
to the customer, and the importance of a seamless and compelling customer experience 
across all new digital processes, channels and devices. 
Preparing your response
After understanding the disruption, it’s time to formulate your response. Preparing your 
response requires strong alignment across the organisation from strategy to innovation 
to execution. Strategy can help to guide the innovation function in terms of strategic 
focus areas and help to direct innovation efforts and campaigns towards those initia­
tives that have the most strategic significance to customers and which are well aligned 
with the organisation's digital business vision, direction and capabilities.
Leading and organising for digital transformation
On the front-end, from a strategy perspective, it’s important to conduct rigorous market 
research and put your innovation programme into overdrive. That means fine-tuning 
your programme across strategy and intent, people, process, technology and continuous 
improvement to maximise your organisational potential for digital business innova­
tion. Chapter 5, ‘Organising the adapting corporate innovation processes for digital 
17

MASTERING DIGITAL BUSINESS
transformation’, provides leadership guidance on how to change and fine-tune an exist­
ing corporate innovation programme to most effectively support digital transformation 
both now and in the years to come. We also explore the five critical pillars of innovation 
management capability, so you can ensure that your innovation programme has all the 
appropriate elements for ongoing success. 
In preparing your response to digital disruption, as a key element in your innovation 
arsenal, it’s also important to conduct frequent innovation workshops and talk to 
customers, partners and other industry experts — even outside your industry segment. 
Chapter 6, ‘Identifying and prioritising opportunities with innovation workshops’, 
explores how leaders can apply these highly targeted, event-based sessions to focus 
on innovation opportunity identification, categorisation, prioritisation and then the 
development of high-level business cases and roadmaps for the most promising 
opportunities identified. 
Digital transformation strategies for specific target business outcomes
With your innovation engine fine-tuned and ready for action, you can now begin to craft 
and execute your response, whether it’s a defensive or offensive measure, or a first-
mover attack. You might simply optimise your current position in the value chain or 
change your position to get closer to the customer. 
One strategy for getting closer to the customer is to apply big data analytics to 
understand your customers’ preferences, needs, interests and behaviours far better 
than anyone else. Collecting information about your customers’ usage of your products 
or services may enable you to monetise the data swirling around your product or service 
as well, by turning it into additional value-added services for your customers. 
A key factor in improved digital customer experience is re-thinking how customers do 
business with you, much as Uber has done for finding a taxi. This is typically where 
SMAC computing comes into play, but disrupters may additionally incorporate IoT 
business models (such as our earlier smart parking example with Streetline) or even 
robotics business models (as evidenced by some of the recent robotic valets appearing 
in hotels such as the Japanese hotel Huis Ten Bosch and the Aloft hotel chain). 
Innovation can also focus on a single, yet critical, business process such as usage-
based insurance models. In the insurance example, technology comes in with intelligent 
sensors that measure things like acceleration and hard braking, letting the insurer offer 
incentives for good driving behaviour – and taking loyalty programmes to the next level, 
with incentives based on actual driving behaviour at a highly granular level, as opposed 
to simply on repeat business from month to month. 
If you simply want to optimise your current position in the value chain, your initial focus 
might be on employee-centred improvements by transforming the digital workplace or 
on optimisation of your IT infrastructure and operations by enabling an industrialised 
software-defined data centre (SDDC). 
If we look more closely at enabling the digital workplace, we can see how the foundational 
building blocks of digitally based business models can come into play. For example, 
wearables such as Google Glass can enable hands-free process optimisation in areas 
18

DESIGNING YOUR DIGITAL BUSINESS STRATEGY AND VISION
like item picking in a warehouse. Recent trials, such as those conducted by DHL in their 
‘vision picking’ pilots, have shown reduced error rates in the warehouse picking process 
and overall efficiency improvements of up to 25 per cent.8 
Intelligent automation is another area of significant opportunity. We’re already seeing 
the convergence of human–machine work processes, where humans are becoming 
increasingly instrumented and machines are becoming increasingly connected with 
humans to create an optimised blend of human–machine participation and interaction.
Cognitive systems and intelligent automation techniques are reducing costs and 
dependence on labour-based processes and optimising service efficiency. Advances in 
machine learning, expert systems and robotics are leading to automation opportunities 
in both virtual (that is, software) and physical scenarios. 
A relevant software-based example is the emerging role of what are known as ‘cognitive 
virtual agents’ or ‘virtual engineers’ in the next-generation call centre. These agents 
interface on human terms in natural language. They think, speak and learn on the job – 
improving business processes and making better-informed decisions. A recent example 
is IPSoft’s Amelia technology, which is being used to transform IT operations labour mix 
with digital labour, costing one-third of the typical human full-time employee (FTE) cost. 
Chapters 8–11 take a detailed look at each of these target business outcomes around 
digital transformation, ranging from enhancing the digital customer experience, to 
transforming the digital workplace, to gaining insights from analytics and finally to 
optimising infrastructure and simplifying management. These areas represent some of 
the key value levers organisations can apply to get the most out of their digital business 
strategies. 
Taking an agile journey to the new platform ecosystem
Going back to our value chain discussion, the business strategies and options regard­
ing how and where to play in the future value chain are the same strategic decisions 
that organisations have needed to make for decades. What’s new and different is the 
magnitude of potential business disruption and transformation via today’s fresh new 
wave of disruptive technologies. 
Your strategic response to digital disruption can make use of a rich set of foundational 
building blocks in the form of disruptive technologies – some mature, others emerging. 
Whatever your business strategy, you can select from these foundational building blocks 
and apply them in powerful combinations to enable your target business outcomes. 
In the final chapters of this book, we’ll explore how to execute your roadmap to digital 
transformation by mastering what it takes to manage the digital services lifecycle and 
in recognition that existing applications and infrastructure need to be carefully migrated 
or maintained.

MASTERING DIGITAL BUSINESS
KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR CHAPTER 1
yy In terms of the art of the possible, due to the ‘digital medium’ new business 
models are designed to operate in, they have the intrinsic potential to be 
more transformative than they would appear from the outside. 
yy By digitising a traditionally analogue business model or process, we’re 
effectively turning it into bits and atoms and enabling an infinite variety 
of possibilities. The rules can be whatever you want them to be – with the 
market being the petri dish to determine if the new rules are viable and can 
lead to adoption and growth. 
yy The five forces framework, together with our observations of how the 
new digital threat (that is, the threat of digital disruption) impacts these 
five forces, can be a useful way to think about the various headwinds and 
tailwinds acting on your envisioned model and how various constituents 
may react.
yy In terms of understanding upcoming disruptions, with careful analysis of 
industry trends, a keen grasp of the art of the possible and observations of 
recent ‘seismic activity’, you can get a sense of what to prepare for in terms 
of ‘who’ (the likely players and their tactics), ‘what’ (a vision for what the 
disruption may look like), ‘where’ (where it can impact your value chain), 
‘when’ (a sense of the disruption’s timing) and ‘how’ (the magnitude of the 
disruption).
yy Some of the key value levers organisations can apply to get the most out 
of their digital business strategies include enhancing the digital customer 
experience, transforming the digital workplace, gaining insights from 
analytics, and optimising infrastructure and simplifying management.

RE-THINKING AND RE-DESIGNING 
YOUR BUSINESS MODELS AND 
PROCESSES
The reason why it is so difficult for existing firms to capitalize on disruptive innova-
tions is that their processes and their business model that make them good at the 
existing business actually make them bad at competing for the disruption.

Clayton Christensen1
Some of the most exciting opportunities for digital transformation relate to re-thinking 
and re-designing business models as well as re-thinking and re-designing the under­
lying business processes that define how these new digital business models operate, 
how value gets exchanged, how digital products and services are delivered, and how 
work gets done.
In terms of re-thinking and re-designing business models, we’ll explore some of the 
strategic options for business model innovation, ranging from evolutionary to revolu­
tionary approaches, and will look at how some of the classic strategy moves still apply 
to the world of digital. To use a chess analogy, while we’re playing on a new chessboard, 
with new pieces and new rules, some of the traditional game sequences and strategy 
techniques still apply and can be highly effective. To illustrate this point, we’ll take an 
in-depth look at the digital business strategy moves by Apple in launching and expand­
ing their Apple Pay service for mobile payments. This was a business model innovation 
in the world of payments, with new players, new technology and a new approach, yet 
it was able to scale to become the world’s leading mobile payments service with over 
12 million monthly users in less than 18 months.2 
In terms of re-thinking and re-designing business processes, we’ll explore how digital 
business process re-design builds upon and adds to prior thinking, such as Hammer 
and Champy's concepts related to business process re-engineering.3 When we exam­
ine digitally re-designed processes, we find there are a number of recurring themes 
and key characteristics which enable digital processes to trump traditional processes 
by being experience-centric, automated, simplified, digitised, personalised, dynamic, 
real time, granular, aggregated and scalable. To help you think further about re-design 
efforts within your own organisation, we’ll also take an in-depth look at some of the 
strategic pathways for re-designing mobile business processes. These pathways are 
focused on improving digital–physical intensity as well as mobile technology intensity 
and include what we can describe as the ‘wow factor’, the ‘must have’, the ‘innovative 
replacement’ and the ‘technology upgrade’.
21

MASTERING DIGITAL BUSINESS
Whether we look at transformed business models or transformed business processes, 
what’s also clear is that the most successful initiatives all tap into the vital elements 
we’ll continue to explore throughout this book: powerful combinations of disruptive 
technology enablers, platform business models and a mastery of digital services, all 
accelerated by leading practices in corporate innovation.
RE-THINKING AND RE-DESIGNING BUSINESS MODELS
The number of strategic options for business model innovation in the age of digital are 
many and varied. They range from digitising products and services, to running or partici­
pating within industry ‘platforms’, to tapping into the sharing economy and crowdsourc­
ing, to reshaping value networks, to creating new models for monetisation. To help you 
think more about these strategic options within your own organisation, we’ll look at each 
of these approaches to explore how they work and to provide some industry examples. 
1. Digitising products and services
When we look at digitising products and services, the options range from digitising 
a physical product or service, to wrapping digital services around a physical product, 
to unbundling how digital services are provided to make them more customised and 
specific. Many years ago, the initial wave of business model innovation was around 
converting physical products such as books, music and movies to their digital equiva­
lents. Examples include Amazon (books), Apple iTunes (music) and Netflix (movies). 
Today, organisations are exploring wrapping physical products with new digital services 
in order to enhance their value proposition for customers. This also generates a long-
term revenue stream from the digital services, which, over time, may be worth far more 
than the one-time sale of the physical product. Examples include GE’s wrapping of data 
and analytics services around its core industrial products such as jet engines and gas 
turbines, as well as Nest’s wrapping of cloud-based video recording services around its 
home security cameras. As another example, home fitness equipment manufacturers 
such as Pro-Form and NordicTrack have incorporated iFit software into their machines 
to provide personalised, ‘smart fitness’ to consumers’ home training routines. With 
an iFit membership, users gain access to custom workouts, Google MapsTM training 
routes, social communities, competitions, automatic stats tracking and so on. This 
set of digital services integrated into the physical home fitness equipment such as 
treadmills, elliptical machines and bikes considerably enhances the value proposition 
for customers.
In terms of unbundling digital services, as an example many insurance companies are 
now offering far more granular insurance policies, not on a yearly or monthly basis, but 
tailored to very specific activities and time periods. The temporary car insurance offered 
by UK companies such as TempCover, DayInsure and InsureDaily is one example, with 
policies offered from 1 to 28 days. Of course, in addition to simply unbundling traditional 
service packages, new digitally based services can also be offered and micro-segmented 
down to highly granular levels in terms of usage, whether it’s micro-payments, micro-
transactions or any other form of measureable usage parameter. In addition to creating 
new options for digitising products and services, this is also leading to new options for 
monetisation, which go hand in hand with these new offerings.
22

RE-THINKING AND RE-DESIGNING YOUR BUSINESS MODELS AND PROCESSES
2. Running or participating within industry platforms
Industry platforms are basically platform-oriented business models that consummate 
matches between buyers and sellers, producers and consumers, or other marketplace 
participants. The value being exchanged can be physical, digital or both. Some of the 
most well-known platform companies include Airbnb, Alibaba, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, 
Facebook, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Netflix, Salesforce, Tencent, Twitter and many others. 
The strategic options for business model innovation in this category include setting up 
your own industry platform as a platform operator, participating within someone else’s 
industry platform as a product, service or content provider, or the ‘arms-dealer’ model 
where you provide the technology building blocks and infrastructure for others to create 
their own platforms. 
As we’ll see when we take an in-depth look at industry platforms in Chapter 4, platform 
operators aren’t just high-tech companies, there’s also many non-tech industry players 
diving into this business model such as Philips (connected health), GE (Industrial 
Internet) and Bosch (manufacturing). Each of these platform operators are building out 
an industry platform for their specific industry, or industries in the case of GE, whereby 
participants can connect into the platform and utilise the various services provided.
The platform model is equally appealing to product, service and content providers since 
they can quickly tap into large and growing marketplaces for their services and can grow 
their revenues as these platforms scale up in terms of the number of participants and 
the number of goods and services on offer. The ‘arms-dealer’ model is typically most 
appealing to technology companies for the reasons described earlier. However, now that 
‘all companies are software companies’, this is becoming an additional strategic option 
for the traditional non-tech sector as well.
3. Tapping into the sharing economy and crowdsourcing
When we look at tapping into the sharing economy, one of the main digital business 
models in this category is geared around offering unused or spare capacity from new 
or existing participants, who are willing to share their goods and services with others. 
This model is often built upon the platform model, in terms of how it operates and 
consummates matches, but it incorporates this added dimension of what’s been termed 
the ‘sharing economy’ by tapping into new sources of value from new participants. 
Examples include Airbnb’s online marketplace in the home rental industry, which 
enables people to list, find and rent vacation homes for a processing fee. The company 
has over 2 million listings in more 34,000 cities and 191 countries.4 
Another digital business model in this category is to tap into crowdsourcing for specific 
organisational functions such as product innovation, product testing or customer ser­
vice. The practice of open innovation, whereby companies such as Procter & Gamble 
(P&G) utilise crowdsourcing techniques to generate ideas for new products and ser­
vices, is a good example. Through their open innovation strategy, P&G has established 
more than 2,000 successful agreements with innovation partners around the world.5 
Another example is Tesla, who use crowdsourcing across their over 70,000-strong 
customer base to assemble a database of user driving patterns and traffic patterns 
with over 780 million miles of data collected to date. The crowdsourcing approach also 
23

MASTERING DIGITAL BUSINESS
allows Tesla to test new software code covertly by observing what the software would 
have done if it were turned on.6
4. Reshaping value networks
Reshaping value networks relates to how you distribute, or re-distribute, the exchange 
of value among participants in your business ecosystem. This can entail new players, 
new roles or changes in existing roles among participants, and changes in the ways 
participants can connect with one another to exchange value. One of the major strat­
egies here is often to move from a pipeline model (that is, a traditional, linear value 
chain) to a platform model (that is, a digital, inter-connected value chain). The industry 
platform and sharing economy types of models that we’ve just seen are good examples. 
Reshaping value networks can also be done in more subtle, evolutionary ways as well. 
For example, an organisation might be able to get closer to the customer in their indus­
try value chain without necessarily having to move to a platform model. In digital health 
care, a lot of the innovation is around reshaping who pays for service and who buys 
service, thus changing the rules of how health care is accessed and delivered. 
As we saw in Chapter 1, organisations may be able to get closer to the customer by 
applying big data analytics to understand their customers’ preferences, needs, interests 
and behaviours far better than anyone else and by offering compelling applications 
and experiences. Collecting information about their customers’ usage of products or 
services may enable them to monetise the data spinning around their products or 
services as well, by turning it into additional value-added services. 
5. Creating new models for monetisation
When we look at creating new models for monetisation, the options include subscription 
pricing models, ‘freemium’ pricing models and free models, to access over ownership, 
and various on-demand models. The latter two of these are closely aligned with the 
sharing economy model, where consumers are moving more towards cost-conscious 
and environmentally friendly approaches where they use just what they need as 
opposed to buying and storing masses of products they may seldom use. According to 
The Guardian, ‘Some 80% of items in UK and US homes are used less than once a month, 
and self-storage is now a $24B industry in the US.’7 
As an example of access over ownership, companies such as ZipCar offer access to cars 
for short time periods as opposed to traditional ownership. They cater to consumers 
who are looking for an alternative to the costs and hassles of owning or renting a car. 
This is particularly beneficial for consumers who want to save money, who take public 
transport and only need to use a car occasionally, or who need a second car once in a 
while. The ZipCar example differs from traditional car rental agencies because they can 
offer vehicles for time periods down to 1 hour, or even 30 minutes in certain cities, and 
additionally charge a single fee as opposed to charging extra for petrol, insurance and 
daily mileage.8 As an example of an on-demand model, companies such as TaskRabbit 
offer help with chores such as housework, delivery or moving.
In terms of subscription, freemium and free models, you only have to look as far as 
Disney, LinkedIn and Google. Disney offers an array of subscription-based services such 
24

RE-THINKING AND RE-DESIGNING YOUR BUSINESS MODELS AND PROCESSES
as DisneyLife, which is a digital membership giving access to Disney movies, kids’ TV 
box sets, books, music and apps, all in one place. LinkedIn offers free basic services 
and a number of plans within their premium service if you want access to enhanced 
features and functionality, depending on your goals. The plans support members looking 
to land their dream job, grow and nurture their network, unlock sales opportunities, or 
find and hire talent. In terms of free models, companies such as Google and Facebook 
offer free access to their various offerings in exchange for access to consumer data 
and their attention. 
Creating new sources of value in new ways
If we look across all these options for business model innovation, we find that it’s all 
about creating new sources of value in new ways. Each strategic option focuses on a 
slightly different aspect of this value creation and addresses a slightly different strategic 
question as follows:
yy Digitising products and services – How can you deliver value through new 
products and services?
yy Running or participating within industry platforms – How can you find and 
exchange value as a market operator or participant?
yy Tapping into the sharing economy and crowdsourcing – How can you capture 
new sources of value from new players?
yy Reshaping value networks – How can you distribute or re-distribute value 
among participants?
yy Creating new models for monetisation – How can you offer or pay for value in 
new ways?
Table 2.1 summarises these strategic options for business model innovation and pro­
vides industry examples for each.

services (e.g. Kiva)
Once an organisation has narrowed in on a specific business model innovation to 
pursue, one of the interesting aspects is that many traditional strategy moves can be 
applied to the new model. In essence, the business model itself may be totally new, but 
the strategy techniques to deploy and grow the model are often classic techniques that 
still hold true today. 
We’ll take a look at some of the digital business strategy moves from Apple in their 
Apple Pay business model, originally launched in 2014, to see how some of these classic 
techniques were applied to their new model.

RE-THINKING AND RE-DESIGNING YOUR BUSINESS MODELS AND PROCESSES
CASE STUDY – APPLE 
Classic (digital) business strategy moves from apple pay
Apple’s announcement at its Worldwide Developer Conference9 of giving shoppers 
even more ways to pay via its Apple Pay service was an interesting example of a set 
of eight classic (digital) business strategy moves the company has executed over the 
course of launching its service. 
I’ve put the term ‘digital’ in parentheses because these are classic strategy moves that 
apply to both traditional business strategies as well as modern-day digital business 
strategies. 
Here’s the list of eight moves that I believe have been key to the adoption and success 
of the Apple Pay service in recent years: 
1. Improve the (digital) customer experience: Customers typically adopt new tech­
nologies and approaches because they are faster, better or cheaper. This is the key to 
any disruptive change, whether it’s a new product, service or entire business model. 
The new product or service doesn’t have to have the most features and functions, but 
must simply be good enough and compelling enough to drive adoption and a departure 
from the status quo. In this case, the customer experience was improved by a radically 
easier way to pay; as simple as the touch of a finger. The starting point for any digital 
transformation is taking this outside-in perspective, looking at things from the cus­
tomer’s point of view, and making things simple and elegant. 
2. Transform the (digital) business process: In conjunction with the first move, it’s 
important to also re-think and re-design the business process in the new context – in 
this case the context of mobile payments. An improved customer experience isn’t all 
that great if it’s built on top of an old, outdated and complicated process. In this case, 
the ability to pay via the touch of a finger made the process about as simple as it could 
possibly get when compared to the traditional, physical wallet approach, while at the 
same time making it work with other Apple products such as the Apple Watch, prior 
versions of iPhones such as the 5, 5c and 5s (via the Apple Watch) and the iPad. 
3. Address the (digital) barriers to adoption: As with most emerging technologies over 
the years, security and privacy are often at the top of the list when it comes to barri­
ers to adoption. The Apple Pay system addressed this head on in both areas. In terms 
of security, the Touch ID feature enabled Apple to biometrically authenticate users as 
part of the payment process itself and remove the need for cashiers to see your name, 
credit card number or security code. Privacy was addressed via Apple deciding not to 
collect purchase history and not knowing what was bought, where it was bought or 
how much was paid for it. 
4. Leverage your (digital) installed base: As opposed to attempting to introduce a new 
product or service to a new set of customers (‘new product/new market’), it’s always 
safer to bring a new product or service to your existing installed base, or to bring an 
existing product or service to new customers. That way you’re dealing with one un­
known instead of two, and it’s more of an adjacency play. By leveraging their installed 
Icon
27

MASTERING DIGITAL BUSINESS
base of over 200 million iPhone 5 users (at the time), together with customers already 
planning to upgrade to the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus for various other reasons, Apple was 
able to offer the Apple Pay service without requiring customers to invest or make any 
changes solely for the service itself. 
5. Use existing (digital) infrastructure and standards: When launching a new product 
or service, it’s important not to require partners to make huge investments in infra­
structure or to require customers to make changes that would detract from the overall 
value proposition of the offering. By leveraging the near field communication (NFC) 
standard, Apple wasn’t requiring merchants to install dedicated or proprietary hard­
ware and could ride on the contactless payments trend already underway. 
6. Time your (digital) move: Another classic strategy move is to let your competi­
tors make any first mover mistakes, let the market and/or technology mature a little 
further, and wait until the market timing and customer appetite is just right to launch 
your offering. This is a strategy that Apple has utilised time and time again whether it 
is music, smartphones, tablets or smart watches. Apple hasn’t necessarily been the 
first to bring technology innovation to the table, but has innovated with design, simplic­
ity and elegance to make its products and services highly compelling for its audience. 
7. Leverage partners for (digital) credibility: In the case of a technology player mak­
ing an entrance into a vertical industry ecosystem, it’s important to team with industry 
partners to establish credibility and acceptance within the market and to complete the 
integrated value proposition. When Apple announced Apple Pay in September 2014,10 
it had lined up support for credit and debit cards from the three major payment net­
works: American Express, MasterCard and Visa, issued by some of the most popular 
banks, so that it could address 83 per cent of the credit card purchase volume in the US. 
It also had support from leading retailers so that it could address 220,000 merchant 
locations across the US that had contactless payments enabled. 
8. Innovate (digitally) then radiate: One of the final steps in any strategy is to expand to 
other geographies, customers and partners. You might call this an ‘innovate, then radi­
ate’ approach. Apple’s announcement at its Worldwide Developer Conference in June 
2015 was exactly that. The company announced support for rewards programmes and 
store-issued credit and debit cards with iOS 9. In addition, they announced expanding 
merchant acceptance to over 1 million locations in July 2015 and support for Discover 
in the autumn. In terms of geographic expansion, they announced expansion to the UK 
to work with 250,000 retail locations and the London Transit System. Continuing this 
geographical expansion, in December 2015 they announced a partnership with China 
UnionPay to bring Apple Pay to China.11 
Key takeaways
There are a number of lessons to be learned from looking at Apple’s strategic moves 
related to Apple Pay. One of them is that the bulk of these moves were conceived and 
executed pre-launch. By the time the service was announced in late 2014, it was essen­
tially a case of methodical execution. The announcement at their Worldwide Developer 
Conference was simply one more step in a classic (digital) business strategy.
28

RE-THINKING AND RE-DESIGNING YOUR BUSINESS MODELS AND PROCESSES
Finally, ‘disruptive’ new offerings always get a lot of debate as to the type and degree 
of disruption. It’s interesting to note that while the Apple Pay service can be considered 
disruptive when compared to former payment techniques such as the use of physical 
wallets and credit cards, as pointed out by Juan Pablo Vazquez Sampere in the Harvard 
Business Review,12 the business model itself is more a reseller model, since it still 
relies on the credit card ecosystem and does not disrupt the industry model itself. This 
raises the question and possibility of perhaps more strategic moves down the road – 
possibly targeted at this very same industry model.
RE-THINKING AND RE-DESIGNING BUSINESS PROCESSES
The goals and objectives related to re-thinking and re-designing business processes 
in the world of digital business are not that different from the original goals and objec­
tives set forth by Michael M. Hammer and James A. Champy in their landmark book, 
Reengineering the corporation, written in 1993. In their book, Hammer and Champy 
defined business process re-engineering as:
Fundamental rethinking and radical redesign of business process to achieve 
dramatic improvements in critical measures of performance such as cost, service, 
and speed.
At the time, IT was one of the key enablers supporting business process re-design 
efforts. Work activities were able to be re-engineered by turning the industrial model 
on its head in terms of moving from simple tasks for workers connected by complex 
processes, to more complex tasks for workers connected by more efficient, stream­
lined and automated processes. Hammer and Champy’s premise was that ‘to meet the 
contemporary demands of quality, service, flexibility, and low cost, processes must be 
kept simple’. 
They also discerned several key characteristics and recurring themes when they studied 
re-engineered processes as follows:
yy Several jobs are combined into one.
yy Workers make decisions.
yy The steps in the process are performed in a natural order.
yy Processes have multiple versions.
yy Work is performed where it makes the most sense.
yy Checks and controls are reduced.
yy Reconciliation is minimised.
yy A case manager provides a single point of contact.
yy Hybrid centralised–decentralised operations are prevalent.
29

MASTERING DIGITAL BUSINESS
Today’s digital transformation initiatives, whether aimed at the industry level, the 
business model level or the process level, are all about achieving the same dramatic 
improvements in cost, service and speed. More than incremental process improve­
ments, or incremental process optimisation, as we saw in Chapter 1, the digital medium 
allows us to completely transform and effectively ‘re-wire’ how value gets exchanged, 
how work gets done and how the underlying processes get conducted. 
When re-designing business processes in the digital age, we can leverage some of the 
same recurring themes that Hammer and Champy discerned, in addition to some new 
ones. For example, digital enables us to move even further along the continuum in terms 
of having work performed ‘where it makes most sense’ from the physical desk, to the 
desktop, to the smartphone and ultimately to the wearable. It also enables processes 
to ‘have multiple versions’, for example allowing manufacturers to move to a ‘lot size 
of 1’, whereby manufactured items can be individually crafted for specific customers to 
enable individualised mass production. This concept extends to the point where ‘smart 
products’, even while they are being made, know the details of their own manufacturing 
process and can communicate this back to the assembly line within the ‘smart factory’.
If we were to come up with a similar set of recurring themes for digitally re-designed 
(re-engineered) business processes, we can discern several key characteristics and 
recurring themes as follows:
yy The digital customer experience drives everything.
yy Processes are highly automated and incorporate seamless hand-offs between 
humans and machines.
yy Processes are simplified down to their most intuitive, minimal steps.
yy Physical distances become irrelevant and are often completely removed from 
the equation. 
yy Processes have multiple versions and infinite configurations down to the 
individual customer, product or service.
yy Dynamic processes are created, deployed and executed ‘on the fly’.
yy Real-time data informs and optimises processes.
yy Fine-grained measurements enable more precise process design.
yy Value propositions are aggregated across industry and company boundaries.
yy Processes are massively scalable through platform business models.
This enables digital processes to be experience-centric, automated, simplified, digitised, 
personalised, dynamic, real time, granular, aggregated and scalable.
Table 2.2 provides some industry examples for these various characteristics. In the table, 
I’ve listed industry examples that most demonstrate each of the specific characteristics, 
but it’s also important to note that many of the best examples combine several of these 
characteristics into their overall process design.

dynamically manage and provision data centre 
services across applications, infrastructure (such as 
compute, network and storage) and even security.
Real time – Real-time data 
informs and optimises 
processes.
GE’s Predix platform enables real-time data 
from locomotives and other industrial assets to 
be fed into their cloud-based operating system 
and analysed to support asset performance 
management and operations optimisation activities, 
including preventive maintenance and repair. 
Granular – Fine-grained 
measurements enable more 
precise process design.
Progressive’s ‘Snapshot’ device allows drivers to 
receive discounts on their monthly policy payments 
based on how they actually drive by recording 
information about the time of day, distance driven, 
and any hard acceleration or braking events.

Scalable – Processes are 
massively scalable through 
platform business models.
Uber utilised the power of the platform business 
model to reach a market capitalisation of over $50B 
in less than five years.13
As we’ll see in Chapters 3 and 4, part of the secret to mastering digital business, and a 
key ingredient in some of the most successful business process re-design efforts using 
the ‘digital medium’, is utilising combinations of enabling technologies to create the 
most compelling digital customer experience possible. Experience-centric digital pro­
cesses, by their very nature, tap into powerful combinations of emerging and disruptive 
technologies as their foundational building blocks. We saw this earlier in our Streetline 
example, which taps into data from IoT sensors, relayed to the cloud, to publish real-
time parking data via a mobile app so drivers can find open parking spots. 
There’s a lot we can learn from studying digital business process re-design examples 
around a single technology enabler as well. Mobility is a great example. In the next sec­
tion, we’ll study some of the key scenarios around mobile process re-design that can 
serve as a framework for thinking about your own re-design initiatives. 
Four scenarios of mobile process re-design
As organisations seek to mobile-enable internal and customer-facing applications 
across their enterprise, one of the most interesting topics is the whole concept of mobile 
process re-design. Mobile-enabling an enterprise application is about more than just 
mobile-enabling the old process; it’s an opportunity to completely re-think and re-design 
the business process from the ground up in the new mobile context. In some cases, it’s 
even an opportunity to invent entirely new business models. You could even call this 
the ‘consumerisation of business processes’, as powerful new mobile devices expand 
possibilities and turn traditional business processes upside down.
The objective with mobile process re-design is to think about how mobility can stream­
line business processes, reduce costs or even deliver entirely new services over the 
mobile channel. This aspect of mobility has been around for a long time, even before 
today’s smartphones, tablets and wearables, but what’s new and different is that today’s 
devices are far more sophisticated and feature-rich – creating possibilities that simply 
weren’t technically feasible even just a few years ago. 
In exploring what might be possible within your organisation, it’s worth looking at some 
of the scenarios already being implemented and proven in the marketplace. If we can 
32

RE-THINKING AND RE-DESIGNING YOUR BUSINESS MODELS AND PROCESSES
classify these scenarios into various types of process re-design it can help illustrate 
some of the potential strategic levers available for chief information officers (CIOs), 
application portfolio managers and business leaders to apply within their mobility strat­
egies (see Figure 2.1). 
Two angles of attack in terms of mobile process re-design are clearly mobile-enabling 
the process (that is, making a non-mobile process mobile) and technology enabling or 
technology enhancing the process (that is, making an already mobile process more auto­
mated). Since mobile-enablement can be a somewhat confusing term relating to either 
the physical aspect of mobility (how the work is performed in terms of digital or physical 
process steps) or the technology aspect of mobility (how the work is performed in terms of 
use of mobile technologies), we’ll use some new terms to describe these angles of attack:
yy Digital–physical intensity – Relates to the level of virtualisation of the process, 
compared to actual physical process steps, being utilised to help digitise the 
process. 
yy Mobile technology intensity – Relates to the level of mobile technology, 
compared to other technologies, being utilised to help automate the process. 
In the first case, if you increase the digital–physical intensity, you’re bringing the process 
to the place where the work actually gets done and may be able to reduce the number 
of process steps. The process is optimised, since there’s no need for redundant and 
time-consuming steps – for example, to go back to the office to enter data and so forth. 
In the second case, if you increase the mobile technology intensity, you’re bringing mobile 
technology such as tablets, smartphones and wearables to bear to help automate the 
process. You may already be conducting your process at the actual point of service, but 
bringing more technology to the table can help improve automation, cut cycle times and 
improve the digital customer experience. 
Figure 2.1  The four scenarios of mobile process re-design
Figure 2.1
33

MASTERING DIGITAL BUSINESS
This graph presents four scenarios to consider within this simple framework of mobile tech­
nology intensity (x-axis) and digital–physical intensity (y-axis). Let’s examine these in detail.
1. The ‘wow factor’
This scenario relates to the use of mobile technology to replace former manual or paper-
based approaches, which are already delivered at the point of service. The business 
benefit is typically reduced costs, faster information access, plus a ‘wow factor’ in cases 
such as customer sales and service, where interactivity and overall experience are key. 
A good example in terms of reduced costs is United Airlines use of the iPad to replace 
their 45 lb flight bags and to provide pilots with access to charts, maps and other cru­
cial navigation tools.14 The business benefit in this case included the ability to save 16 
million sheets of paper a year and to save 326,000 gallons of fuel in terms of weight 
reduction on the flights. 
2. The ‘must have’
This scenario relates to the biggest win possible when a manual process is totally 
re-designed for a new, mobile context with mobile technologies. While most of the 
common scenarios such as sales force automation and field force automation have 
already been implemented, if you find a new opportunity here the business benefits can 
be huge. The business benefit is typically substantial cost savings due to the new level 
of automation, reduced cycle times, and improved convenience and ease of use. 
A classic example is the use of mobile technology in the doctor’s office, where not only 
is the former paper-based process automated, it’s also moved to the point of care so 
physicians and nurses can access and update patient medical records and charts while 
consulting side by side with their patients.
3. The ‘innovative replacement’
This scenario relates to the innovative replacement of proprietary and costly technolo­
gies that are typically not mobile-enabled, with newly available features and functions 
built into today’s next-generation devices such as tablets, smartphones and wearables. 
A time-proven but classic example of innovative replacement is the cheque deposit 
apps from various banks such as Chase’s Mobile app, which contains their QuickDeposit 
service.15 This service lets customers take a photo of the front and back of their cheques 
and then verify the deposit details on their device to make a rapid deposit from the 
comfort of their homes, replacing the need to drive to the bank and use the ATM for the 
same purpose. Square’s solution for merchants to take mobile payments is another 
example – in this case replacing cash registers – and one that garnered them recogni­
tion as one of the most innovative companies on the lists of both Fast Company and MIT 
Technology Review. Other examples in this category include the use of built-in features 
such as Global Positioning System (GPS) and compasses, or even biometrics capabili­
ties to replace former standalone equivalents. 
4. The ‘mobile upgrade’
This scenario is similar to the ‘innovative replacement’, but upgrades an existing mobile 
technology as opposed to a proprietary, non-mobile technology of some kind such as an 
34

RE-THINKING AND RE-DESIGNING YOUR BUSINESS MODELS AND PROCESSES
ATM or cash register. Business benefits typically include cost savings and substantially 
improved usability. 
An example here is the Dallas Museum of Art’s (DMA's) use of smartphones to provide 
interactive museum tours to visitors as a supplement to their use of handheld audio tour 
devices. The DMA was one of the first to offer this capability back in 2010 and is continually 
expanding this service to additional collections and exhibitions within the museum. Another 
example is the growing use of consumer-oriented tablets for field service purposes such 
as delivery routing, as opposed to former proprietary mobile technologies.
Key takeaways
One of the benefits of these scenarios is that they may help to illuminate some of the 
strategic questions to be thinking about related to mobile process re-design and how to 
consumerise your business processes. Questions such as, ‘What mobile technologies 
can we upgrade?’, ‘What proprietary technologies can we totally replace?’ or ‘How can 
we re-think the end-user experience?’ Of course, the key question is, ‘What business 
processes or even business models can we totally reinvent and re-design to do business 
in a whole new manner?’ Is the consumerisation of business processes the next step 
after the consumerisation of IT? Only time will tell, but the emerging scenarios in recent 
years are starting to paint a compelling picture. 
KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR CHAPTER 2
yy The number of strategic options for business model innovation in the age 
of digital are many and varied. They range from digitising products and 
services, to running or participating within industry ‘platforms’, to tapping 
into the sharing economy and crowdsourcing, to reshaping value networks, 
to creating new models for monetisation. If we look across all these options 
for business model innovation, we find that it’s all about creating new 
sources of value in new ways.
yy Once an organisation has narrowed in on a specific business model 
innovation to pursue, one of the interesting aspects is that many traditional 
strategy moves can be applied to the new model. In essence the business 
model itself may be totally new, but the strategy techniques to deploy and 
grow the model are often classic techniques that still hold true today.
yy In terms of re-thinking and re-designing business processes, there are a 
number of recurring themes and key characteristics that enable digital 
processes to trump traditional processes by being experience-centric, 
automated, simplified, digitised, personalised, dynamic, real time, granular, 
aggregated and scalable. Many of the best examples combine several of 
these characteristics into their overall process design. 
yy To help you think further about re-design efforts within your own 
organisation, there are four strategic pathways for re-designing mobile 
business processes. These pathways are focused on improving digital–
physical intensity as well as mobile technology intensity and include 
what we can describe as the ‘wow factor’, the ‘must have’, the ‘innovative 
replacement’ and the ‘technology upgrade’.

MAXIMISING THE POTENTIAL OF 
TODAY’S DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGIES 
FOR DIGITAL BUSINESS
Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.

Arthur C. Clarke1
One of the keys to maximising the potential of today’s disruptive technologies lies in 
exploiting them in powerful combinations. This chapter introduces the set of emerging 
and disruptive technologies – including SMAC technologies, plus wearables, robotics 
and the IoT – that are serving as foundational building blocks for new, digitally ena­
bled business models. We look beyond some of the commonly cited examples of tech 
giants and business scenarios for each disruptive technology, to explore how leading 
organisations such as Uber, GOV.UK and the Mercedes AMG Petronas Formula One team 
are using precise combinations of these technologies to unlock powerful new forms of 
business value. 
SMAC AND THE EVOLUTION OF IT
To provide some background context in terms of how we’ve arrived at today’s diverse set 
of disruptive technologies for digital business, it’s worth looking back to see how the IT 
industry has evolved over time. Every 15 years or so, the IT industry has witnessed new 
innovations in computing that have changed the way IT services are delivered to business 
and end users. After the mainframe era, mini-computing era, personal computer and 
client-server era, and the internet era (or more correctly, the ‘web’ era), we’re now in what 
many call the fifth wave of corporate IT. This fifth wave is characterised by a new master 
IT architecture comprised of SMAC technologies at its core foundation. 
A combination of forces – such as mobility, cloud, big data and social technol­
ogy – means fleet-of-foot start-ups have been able to move into territory that is 
traditionally owned by larger enterprises.2 

(Dr Mark Samuels, n.d.)
One of the key changes over time, throughout all these 
evolutions, has been the exponentially increasing processing 
power of computers, and the steady growth in the number of 
computing devices, applications and users. Table 3.1 shows the 
rough magnitude of these changes across the various computing 
eras – dates and numbers are approximate just to give a sense 
of the order of magnitude.Figure

It should be noted that each era often builds and extends upon the previous era. The era 
simply marks the approximate period that the specific technologies were the predomi­
nant technologies. For example, we still have mainframes and client-server applications 
in the typical large enterprise, and today SMAC technologies are building upon web 
technologies. 
The real promise of today’s digital business technologies – built on top of the SMAC 
foundation – is not necessarily their individual contributions or their cost savings and 
process efficiencies for IT, but their potential to support the continued digitisation, 
automation and transformation of business models and processes. According to many, 
we’re moving into a new ‘digital industrial revolution’.
With the SMAC stack well established as the foundational set of technologies for 
next-generation IT architectures, many are now asking what the next evolution of this 
platform will look like and how it will evolve to support and enable digital business in 
the years ahead. 
BEYOND SMAC: THE NEW PLATFORM FOR DIGITAL BUSINESS
As we discussed in Chapter 1 in the section on preparing for the digital disruption that’s 
coming to your industry, understanding the make-up of this new platform is vital for 
companies wishing to either create digital disruption in their industry or pro-actively 
respond to it. 
When SMAC technologies first hit the scene several years ago, they were broadly 
applicable and highly disruptive to enterprise IT. The next wave of disruptive technologies, 
37

MASTERING DIGITAL BUSINESS
some mature and some emerging, are now broadly applicable and highly disruptive to 
business models and processes. 
So, from being a former ‘disruption’ to enterprise IT, SMAC technologies are now 
becoming the essential building blocks of a new platform for digital business initiatives. 
This new platform for digital business is comprised of the familiar SMAC technologies, 
but adds in personas and context, intelligent automation, the IoT and, of course, cyber 
security. In addition, mobility is evolving and embracing wearable technologies, and 
the cloud is evolving and embracing broader concepts such as hybrid IT and software-
defined data centres.
Table 3.2 lists these foundational building blocks for the new platform for digital 
business and provides an accompanying high-level description of the business value 
that each technology brings to the table. 
Table 3.2  Foundational building blocks for the new platform for digital business
Foundational 
building blocks
Business value
Social computing
•  Social computing enables connection to a new generation 
and is a new effectiveness frontier for workforce 
productivity.
•  Social computing can transform work processes in 
functions such as product development, operations and 
distribution, sales and marketing, and customer service, 
as well as across the entire enterprise.
Mobility and 
wearables
•  Mobility is allowing us to re-imagine the way we access 
and consume information, communicate, and conduct 
business transactions – including payments.
•  Wearables (including smart glasses and watches) 
and augmented reality (AR) applications provide the 
next breakthrough in customer experience, instant 
information and hands-free process optimisation. 
Analytics
•  Insights from big data and real-time analytics can help 
make better decisions, improve efficiencies and gain 
competitive advantage.
Cloud and hybrid IT
•  Cloud technologies and platforms are providing 
agility and flexibility, and cost savings via software-, 
infrastructure-, and platform-as-a-service delivery 
models.
•  End users and consumers typically gain the benefits of 
improved productivity, reduced costs, easy access and a 
pay-as-you-go subscription model.

Personas and 
context
•  Personas and context help organisations deliver a 
compelling, new digital customer experience. 
•  They help organisations better understand the 
customer’s context including preferences, needs, 
interests, behaviours, location, language and sentiment 
so they can deliver a highly curated experience.
Intelligent 
automation
•  Cognitive systems and intelligent automation are helping 
organisations reduce costs and dependence on labour-
based processes and optimise their service efficiencies.
•  Advances in machine learning, expert systems and 
robotics are leading to automation opportunities in both 
physical and virtual (software) scenarios. 
IoT
•  The IoT enables new business models and transformed 
processes based on real-time data and analytics.
•  Intelligent information can be shared across machines, 
networks, individuals or groups to facilitate intelligent 
collaboration and better decision making.
Cyber security
•  New cyber security solutions are helping to secure the 
next wave of IT ‘assets’ including social, mobile, cloud 
and the IoT.
•  These IT assets, external to the traditional security 
‘perimeter’, all multiply the number of internet 
vulnerabilities, necessitating new approaches to securing 
the digital enterprise.
Collectively, these technologies can be utilised to assemble a platform ecosystem of 
on-demand services providing a palette of options for digital business outcomes (see 
Figure 3.1). Based on your perspective, you’ll select powerful combinations of these 
technologies to achieve target business outcomes such as improving the digital cus­
tomer experience, enhancing the digital workplace, transforming business processes, 
optimising infrastructure, simplifying management and implementing an adaptive cyber 
security defence posture. 
If you’re a chief marketing officer (CMO) or business leader, you’ll likely focus on initia­
tives such as applying digital transformation to launch new business models, products 
and services; enhancing the digital customer experience to improve customer loyalty 
and revenues; transforming business processes to reduce costs, improve produc­
tivity and differentiate offerings; or obtaining insights from analytics to make better

decisions, improve efficiencies and gain competitive advantage. In this case, you’ll 
select mostly from technologies to the left of the circle, but tap into those on the right 
as needed as well. 
If you’re a CIO, you’ll likely focus on the aforementioned business initiatives in part­
nership with your business colleagues, plus core IT initiatives such as establishing a 
mission-critical infrastructure with increased agility, flexibility, manageability and secu­
rity. In this latter case, you’ll select mostly from technologies to the right of the circle. 
Overall, this new platform can be used as a frame of reference for digital business trans­
formation in terms of the key IT capabilities – both technologies and approaches – needed 
to support your target business outcomes. Here are six key characteristics of the plat­
form and how the model can help with your planning: 
yy Foundational building blocks – Key disruptive technologies serve as 
foundational building blocks – some mature, some emerging. The SMAC stack 
will likely represent the core building blocks, but you’ll add other technologies 
based on your specific innovation needs and objectives. The IoT and intelligent 
automation (including both software and physical robots) will likely play a big 
role, but so will other enablers such as 3D printing and machine learning. 
yy Common groupings of services – Common groupings of services such as those 
provided by SDDCs can address specific business objectives and accelerate 
time-to-market. Rather than build out every foundational element in support of 
a particular business objective, you may be able to find off-the-shelf capabilities 
where the various disruptive technologies have been pre-integrated and pre-
packaged so you can put them to work immediately. For example, you may 
find a SDDC capability that has already pre-integrated the traditional SDDC 
40

MAXIMISING THE POTENTIAL OF TODAY’S DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGIES FOR DIGITAL BUSINESS
	 components of ‘compute’, ‘network’ and ‘storage’, with additional elements such 
as software-defined security and software-defined management. 
yy Ecosystem of services – Rather than a monolithic platform that integrates 
everything, the future platform will consist of a highly virtualised, highly 
distributed, ecosystem of services from best-in-class providers – some of these 
capabilities you’ll build yourself, others you’ll outsource or subscribe to as-a-
service, and others you may co-create with partners. 
yy Framework for assessment – The platform provides a simple framework for 
assessing digital business proficiency and opportunity areas. For example, 
are you adequately leveraging each of these disruptive technology enablers 
in support of your business objectives? Perhaps you’re totally up to speed in 
leveraging the SMAC stack, but what about the IoT and areas such as wearables 
or robotic process automation? 
yy Digital services lifecycle – Mastery of the digital services lifecycle is going to 
become a key competency for organisations to grow their business and build 
sustainable competitive advantage in the years ahead. It’s no longer sufficient 
to have an innovative set of products or services, you have to be a master of 
how you design, develop, deploy, manage and continually evolve your digital 
services as well. This is where capabilities such as agile and DevOps come into 
play so that you can quickly develop and deploy your new digital services. Agile 
is a collection of evolving delivery and management frameworks for dynamic 
and innovative delivery environments – like IT deliveries.3 DevOps focuses on 
improving collaboration between development and operations teams through 
the adoption of agile, lean practices in the context of a system-oriented 
approach.4 
yy The agile journey to the new platform – Since IT will be a hybrid environment 
for quite some time, it will be important to interoperate across the two divides 
of the current state environment and this future vision. An agile, iterative 
journey to the future platform should be driven by specific business outcomes 
enabled by the appropriate sub-set of disruptive technologies. For example, an 
organisation might undergo several tracks, or work streams, in parallel – with 
an iterative approach to reduce risk and deliver early benefits. One track might 
be around optimising existing infrastructure and simplifying management and 
a parallel track might be around improving the digital customer experience and 
transforming business processes. 
All in all, the new platform for digital business can be useful in thinking about the addi­
tional technology enablers, beyond the SMAC stack, that can add value and competi­
tive advantage for digital business initiatives. In addition, one of the key points is that 
these technology enablers can be used in powerful combinations to support your tar­
get business objectives. For example, in digital workplace initiatives you may decide to 
‘instrument the human’ with wearables and sensors and also ‘socialise the machine’ 
with natural language interfaces and the ability to collaboratively access and provision 
robotic functions via social networks. This will help to optimise the blend of human–
machine participation and interaction within your re-designed business processes for 
the digital workplace. 
41

MASTERING DIGITAL BUSINESS
If we apply the model to some of today’s most interesting start-ups and next-generation 
business models, you’ll find they apply many, if not all, of these technology enablers as 
part of their innovative approach. The following three case studies provide examples 
of how Uber, the UK Government and the Mercedes AMG Petronas Formula One team 
approach digital transformation by using precise combinations of enabling technology, 
a platform approach as part of their operating model, and a mastery of digital service 
design and delivery.
 CASE STUDY – UBER
Decoding UBER’s platform for digital business
If we look at the foundational technologies behind Uber’s business model, we find the 
same set of emerging and disruptive technologies in our model. Uber’s model is about 
more than just a mobile app on a smartphone and actually combines SMAC as well as 
the latest techniques around agile service development and DevOps (see Figure 3.2). All 
of this is delivered via a ‘platform’ business model that consummates matches – in this 
case between passengers and drivers – in a similar fashion to other well-known plat­
form companies such as Airbnb, Alibaba, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, LinkedIn, 
Microsoft, Netflix, Salesforce, Tencent, Twitter and many others. 
At the core of the business model, of course, is the mobile app that lets consumers 
request a ride with the push of a button and track the driver’s progress to their loca­
tion. Social features come into play in terms of rider ratings and driver feedback to help 
ensure ‘high quality, highly rated transportation providers and drivers’.5 Social features 
are also used so that passengers can share their ETA with friends and family. Uber’s 
analytic model sets prices for rides based on distance, car type and demand period. 
Cloud computing comes into play in terms of Uber’s as-a-service infrastructure, which 
operates in over 450 cities worldwide.
In addition to the core foundational technologies that Uber utilises, as per our model, 
two other key elements to the overall approach include their platform approach (see 
Chapter 4) as well as their approach to mastering the digital services lifecycle (see 
Chapter 12). The platform approach in terms of consummating matches between pas­
sengers and drivers enables Uber to scale their business rapidly, since they are tapping 
into the so-called ‘sharing economy’ of unused capacity and are simply providing the 
transaction platform to enable these matches to occur. The digital services lifecycle 
concept, something I term ‘digital services mastery’, relates to the ability of organisa­
tions to master how they design, develop, deploy, manage and continually evolve their 
digital services. 
Even with the best set of enabling technologies and the best platform business model 
in the world, organisations still need to be able to respond rapidly to changing customer 
needs and market dynamics, and they need to be able to deploy and iterate their digital 
services quickly and efficiently at speed and at scale. By employing techniques such 
as agile and DevOps, Uber is able to iterate rapidly in terms of experimenting with new 
features, or even entire new service offerings, and is able to quickly place applications 
into production once they’re developed. icon

MASTERING DIGITAL BUSINESS
CASE STUDY – UK GOVERNMENT
Decoding GOV.UK’s platform for digital business
The Government Digital Service (GDS) is part of the UK Cabinet Office and is leading 
the digital transformation of government. The GDS is a centre of excellence in digital, 
technology and data, collaborating with UK government departments to help them with 
their own transformation. The GDS works with them to build platforms, standards and 
digital services. In addition to running GOV.UK, the authoritive place to find government 
services and information, the GDS builds platforms such as GOV.UK Verify, works to 
ensure that government data is good data and helps departments provide their staff 
with better value technology that’s more of a tool and less of a barrier.6 The GDS has 
won numerous design awards and is a recognised world leader in public sector digital 
innovation, serving as a model for many countries worldwide including the US, Aus­
tralia and New Zealand.
Against a 2009–10 baseline, in 2014–15 the Cabinet Office helped government 
save £1.7 billion through digital and technology transformation as a direct result of 
work done across government by departmental teams building digital services and 
making better use of technology.7 As an example, some of the significant advances in 
implementing digital transformation over the last UK parliament have included:
yy Over 98% of driving tests are now booked online.
yy Eighty-five per cent of self-assessment filing is done through online 
channels.
yy Twelve million people have registered to vote using a new digital service.
The GDS’ approach to digital transformation incorporates an ‘outside in’ approach to 
provide an authentic voice of government on the web with new behaviours, skills and 
capabilities, powered by innovative technology to get to the future state. As per our 
model for mastering digital business, two other key elements of their approach, in 
addition to combinations of innovative technology, include their platform approach (see 
Chapter 4) as well as their approach to mastering the digital services lifecycle (see 
Chapter 12). To achieve this, the GDS incorporates a focus on shared resources via a 
‘government as a platform’ approach to provide a common infrastructure and set of 
componentry to rapidly assemble new digital services, coupled with a focus on people 
and capability to enable more iterative and incremental delivery models.icon
Outside-in approach
According to Stephen Foreshew-Cain, Executive Director of the GDS, what was particu­
larly disruptive about GOV.UK was not the use of innovative technology so much as the 
consistent, authentic voice of government that the site has enabled.8 To understand the 
magnitude of the change in terms of how the UK Government has transformed itself via 
technology, it’s helpful to look at how government utilised technology in the past. 
When the civil service was created in the mid-19th century, and up until fairly 
recently, technology was seen as something government buys. It wasn’t seen as a 
44

MAXIMISING THE POTENTIAL OF TODAY’S DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGIES FOR DIGITAL BUSINESS
core competency. As technology became mainstream, government didn’t respond and 
found itself in a position where technology was a first order problem when it should 
have been a fourth order problem. Government agencies had a presence on the web, 
but disparate technologies were dictating the experience, and agency websites had 
very different voices, fractured interactions and limited branding. 
Working with government departments and agencies, the GDS changed this by bring­
ing the web properties of 24 ministerial departments and 331 other agencies and pub­
lic bodies together in GOV.UK. The idea was to enable citizens to have a consistent, 
authentic experience regardless of which service they were using and to move to a 
more modern digital service estate while recognising that many services were 10 or 
more years old. 
To undertake the transformation, the GDS took an adaptive and iterative approach by 
starting with alpha and beta versions of GOV.UK, to prove the concept and make a 
compelling case for ministers, before moving GOV.UK into production. In terms of their 
‘outside-in’ approach, the GDS has focused on re-setting the way that services work 
to be unified, cross-department journeys (whether that’s buying a vehicle, importing 
plants or disposing of waste), as well as creating ‘service patterns’ that provide con­
sistent standards for the way a repeated activity should work for both users and gov­
ernment.9 Today, GOV.UK operates approximately 806 services, with over 2.38 billion 
completed transactions per year.10 
Government as a platform
The goal of government as a platform has been not just cost savings and efficiency 
improvements, but to reduce the cycle time between policy design and service imple­
mentation. By providing a common infrastructure, with reusable services such as noti­
fication and licensing, and componentry to assemble these services, the GDS has been 
able to assemble and deploy new digital services for UK citizens in much shorter time 
frames. Some of the current platform services include GOV.UK Verify for identity assur­
ance, GOV.UK Pay for processing payments, and GOV.UK Notify for helping government 
service teams send text messages, emails or letters to users. 
Government as a platform also encompasses ‘registers’ work whereby the law 
instructs government to establish, maintain or keep a register, which is an authori­
tative list of information. By simplifying and standardising how data is stored and 
accessed, the registrars who are responsible for the data can focus more on their 
domain-specific tasks.11 
A good example of an improved digital service has been the process of booking a 
prison visit. There was a policy to make these visits more accessible and easier to set 
up. Evidence suggested that when prisoners had regular visits with family members, 
there were better outcomes for both the prisoners and the overall system. By assem­
bling a new prison visit booking service that was easier to use, more accessible via 
digital channels, and made up of component services such as identity and scheduling, 
the booking service saw an uptick of visits of about 10%.

Digital services mastery
In addition to his responsibility for building digital infrastructure for government, Mr 
Foreshew-Cain is also Head of Function, which means he is responsible for defining 
the skills, capabilities and standards needed for service development and deployment. 
The team works on the principle that approaches such as agile and DevOps must be 
adopted to be able to quickly and rapidly iterate services in line with policy. The team 
is working to make this approach the new normal and to chunk down work activities 
so they can be quickly tested and validated. As an example, any technology spend over 
certain thresholds must come to the GDS for review. The team starts with a discovery 
phase to better understand user needs, and then progresses through alpha and beta 
phases. This helps to prove that the policy intent can be successfully delivered via 
solution development. 
Moving forwards
With this set of capabilities in place, the GDS team is now focusing on going wholesale 
in terms of scaling across government. The goal is to ‘help departments work together 
to transform government to meet user needs’.12 Three themes underpinning this effort 
are standards and assurance, shared resources, and people and capability. In the lon­
ger term, the GDS believes that digital transformation has the ‘potential to radically 
alter the structure of government – not just the services it provides, not just the way it 
builds and maintains them, but the way it operates itself’.13

Digital business lessons from the world of Formula One

MAXIMISING THE POTENTIAL OF TODAY’S DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGIES FOR DIGITAL BUSINESS
In addition to the blistering excitement of race day, the world of Formula One is well 
known for its technology innovation and advancements that later find their way into the 
consumer car industry. Examples include a multitude of innovations related to engines, 
transmission, braking and safety. 
With all the interest in digital transformation in the business world, what can the world 
of Formula One, where results are measured in thousandths of a second, teach us 
about emerging technologies and how to manage, combine and optimise them to 
deliver competitive advantage? 
According to Matt Harris, Head of IT at the Mercedes AMG Petronas Formula One team, 
there are a number of business objectives his team has to address. First, the goal of IT 
is to support and improve the business as a whole. The Formula One team doesn’t sell 
anything, since the ‘product’, in this case, goes around the track. IT therefore focuses 
on providing and operating the core, car-enabling technologies for race performance 
as well as for the team’s website and worldwide fan base. 
The use of SMAC therefore comes into play in a diverse set of scenarios:
yy In terms of the fan base, the team supports over 10.5 million Facebook fans 
and over 1.2 million Twitter followers.
yy Mobility, analytics and cloud all play a role across both the racing and fan base 
aspects of the operation as the organisation generates about 6 terabytes (TB) 
a day as a business and an additional ½ TB on race weekends.
It’s all about the analytics 
One of the key enabling technologies from a racing perspective is data analytics. 
According to Harris, the team collects more data now within a single race weekend 
than they did across every race weekend from 1998 to 2006 combined. Given approxi­
mately 16 to 19 races per Formula One racing season, this equates to over 150 times 
the data volume being collected compared to prior years. 
Whether its tyre temperature, degradation or many other factors, the team is always 
looking for the next way to measure and improve. This often means collecting higher 
resolution data while striving to make sensors lighter and more accurate. With an aver­
age of 200 sensors used on each of their F1 W06 Hybrid cars during the Grand Prix event, 
sensor weight is measured in fractions of grams. During practice sessions on Fridays, 
there can be even more sensors on the car as the team collects data about aerodynamics 
and other factors that can aid learning and optimisation of race-day performance. 
Much like the corporate world, collecting and analysing data in Formula One is always a 
compromise in terms of how much you can consume, what to evaluate and how quickly 
you can act on your insights. The FIA, the sport’s regulatory body, imposes rules con­
cerning use of telemetry data and also how many team members can actually go to the 
track, while use of sensors is limited in many areas so teams can’t use trick software 
coding to cheat the rules. In addition, teams are now restricted to up to 60 staff at the 
track – down from over 100 in prior years – so that means a limited number of eyes 
to look at the data. 
47

MASTERING DIGITAL BUSINESS
Interestingly, when it comes to monitoring the drivers’ vital signs, the team uses a 
more analogue approach, with verbal communications between driver and pit lane as 
opposed to a large number of automated sensors. So it’s a case of applying technol­
ogy where it can lend the most impact as opposed to trying to measure and digitise 
everything possible.
One of the most recent innovations related to the team’s use of telemetry has been the 
ability to download race car telemetry data via Wi-Fi using 5 GHz spectrum through 
their partnership with Qualcomm. This enables the team to ‘make better use of limited 
practice sessions and spend more time testing the configuration of the vehicle’. The 
move to higher frequency 5 GHz spectrum enables much faster data transfer including 
data from thermal imaging tyre cameras. 
Seeking the next technology enablers 
So what are the additional technology enablers that the team uses beyond SMAC? 
How is the team applying enablers such as the IoT, 3D printing and machine learning? 
The IoT clearly comes into play around the team’s use of sensors. The emphasis, as 
described earlier, is not only around data collection to improve speed, efficiency and 
vehicle safety, but around optimising the physical characteristics of the sensors and 
their positioning in the race car environment. This is a valuable lesson for the corporate 
world in terms of thinking strategically about what IoT sensors you need, where to posi­
tion them and how the data can drive real-time outcomes. 
According to Harris, the team has been at the leading edge of 3D printing for around 
15 years now, if not more. This is in stark contrast to today’s corporate organisations 
who, for the most part, are just starting to explore and deploy the technology. On the 
race cars themselves, the team has been using 3D printing for about five to six years 
for some of the less critical components such as non-load-bearing items. 
Machine learning and predictive analytics is an area in which Harris wants to continue 
to improve in the years ahead. The team is interested in what new computer-generated 
insights can be provided to human analysts in order to constantly explore new per­
spectives and ideas. 
When it comes to other automotive innovations, Harris expects to see efficiency tech­
nologies such as energy recovery systems migrate through to road cars much as inno­
vations in car safety migrated through to road cars in prior years. Of course, some of 
the current innovations in road cars, such as self-driving capabilities and certain safety 
systems, purposefully won’t migrate in the other direction because Formula One also 
places a premium on the human element in terms of driver skill and ability. 
Achieving world-leading performance
In 2016, the Mercedes AMG Petronas Formula One Team wrapped up the first and sec­
ond place slots in the Drivers’ Championship, with Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton 
respectively, and the overall Constructors’ Championship. 
An interesting takeaway from their IT strategy is perhaps that to achieve world-leading 
performance for the business, you don’t necessarily have to be a world leader on the 
48

MAXIMISING THE POTENTIAL OF TODAY’S DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGIES FOR DIGITAL BUSINESS
bleeding edge of every single technology enabler. It’s more a case of being – or striving 
to become – a world leader and innovator in the areas that matter, and being a fast 
follower in the rest. 
This should be encouraging news for corporate IT departments looking to get a digital 
business edge from today’s latest tech trends. Pick the mix of technology enablers you 
need to succeed, place your bets and deploy your resources appropriately. 
Overall, when we study leading organisations such as Uber, GOV.UK and the Mercedes 
AMG Petronas Formula One team we find they all share a common DNA in terms of their 
approach to digital transformation. Whether it’s operating taxi services in over 450 cities 
worldwide, helping the UK Government save £1.7 billion for taxpayers, or winning the 
Formula One Driver’s and Constructor’s Championships, they all have three key ele­
ments in common. They all apply precise combinations of enabling technology to unlock 
new sources of business value, utilise a platform approach as part of their business or 
operating model, and have become masters of digital service design and deployment. 
KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR CHAPTER 3
yy One of the keys to maximising the potential of today’s disruptive technologies 
lies in exploiting them in powerful combinations. A new set of emerging and 
disruptive technologies are serving as foundational building blocks for new, 
digitally enabled business models. 
yy This new platform for digital business is comprised of the familiar SMAC 
technologies, but adds in personas and context, intelligent automation, 
the IoT and, of course, cyber security. In addition, mobility is evolving and 
embracing wearable technologies, and the cloud is evolving and embracing 
broader concepts such as hybrid IT and SDDCs.
yy Collectively, these technologies can be utilised to assemble a platform 
ecosystem of on-demand services providing a palette of options for digital 
business outcomes. 
yy Based on your perspective, you’ll select powerful combinations of these 
technologies to achieve target business outcomes such as improving the 
digital customer experience, enhancing the digital workplace, transforming 
business processes, optimising infrastructure, simplifying management 
and implementing an adaptive cyber security defence posture. 
yy Even with the best set of enabling technologies and the best platform 
business model in the world, organisations still need to be able to respond 
rapidly to changing customer needs and market dynamics, and they need 
to be able to deploy and iterate their digital services quickly and efficiently 
at speed and at scale.

THE NEW PLATFORM ECOSYSTEM FOR 
DIGITAL BUSINESS
Platform companies are emerging as important engines of innovation. They are 
increasingly at the cutting edge of rapid worldwide digital transformation. 

Peter C. Evans, The Center for Global Enterprise1
In the previous chapter we explored how various emerging and disruptive technologies 
are coming together to serve as the foundational building blocks for disruptions in the 
form of new, digitally enabled business models, processes, products and services. We 
saw how organisations such as Uber, GOV.UK and the Mercedes AMG Petronas Formula 
One Team are leveraging these technologies to deliver digitally transformed business 
models and processes that enable world-leading performance and results. 
In this chapter, we’ll dive deeper into the power of exploiting these technology 
combinations for specific business objectives across the organisation as well as the 
power of exploiting digital business ecosystem and platform approaches that are fast 
becoming the ‘dominant’ go-to-market business model. According to Peter C. Evans, 
Vice President at The Center for Global Enterprise, and one of the original authors of 
GE’s visionary Industrial internet2 paper back in 2012, ‘Platform companies are emerging 
as important engines of innovation. They are increasingly at the cutting edge of rapid 
worldwide digital transformation.’
It is this mix of disruptive technologies, platform business models, together with a 
mastery of digital services – in terms of how digital services are designed, developed, 
deployed, managed and continually evolved – that really sets today’s digital business 
leaders head and shoulders above the rest of the field. These elements are therefore 
at the heart of truly mastering digital business and crafting a successful strategy and 
roadmap for the years ahead.
EXPLOITING THE POWER OF TECHNOLOGY COMBINATIONS
As we think about various digital business objectives ranging from improving the digital 
customer experience, to transforming the digital workplace, to optimising digital infra­
structure and simplifying management, we can see that different technology combi­
nations come into play. Organisations can select the appropriate sub-set of building 
blocks, in the form of these distinct technology enablers, based on their target business 
outcomes.
50

THE NEW PLATFORM ECOSYSTEM FOR DIGITAL BUSINESS
Today’s applications are driven by more than SMAC, and often incorporate and 
integrate many additional features and capabilities. These are what research firm IDC 
calls ‘technology accelerators’3 and they have the potential to radically extend digital 
capabilities and applications. Our reference model in this book for the new platform for 
digital business, as shown in the previous chapter, includes SMAC technologies as well 
as personas and context, intelligent automation, the IoT and, of course, cyber security. In 
addition, as we saw earlier, mobility is evolving and embracing wearable technologies 
and AR applications, and the cloud is evolving and embracing broader concepts such 
as hybrid IT and SDDCs. While these eight technologies comprise the core of the new 
platform for digital business, other technology enablers such as 3D printing come into 
play as well in specific scenarios and industries. 
We’ll now explore some of these target business outcomes, and the requisite technology 
enablers, to provide some examples of what’s included and how they can be combined 
to deliver transformative business value. 
Improving the digital customer experience
When we think about improving the digital customer experience we typically think about 
SMAC enablers, as well as personas and context, and robust cyber security as follows:
yy Social – To enable customers to share, be heard and be informed via social 
channels.
yy Mobile – To enable customer access anytime, anywhere with re-designed 
business processes for faster, improved experience.
yy Analytics – To enable customers to interactively analyse their data and be 
provided with recommendations to help them make informed decisions.
yy Cloud – To enable customers to access services on demand in a flexible, pay-
as-you-go model.
yy Personas and context – To understand the customers’ context including 
preferences, needs, interests, behaviours, location, language and sentiment via 
a highly personalised and contextualised experience.
yy Cyber security – To enable customer safety with privacy and security integrated 
into the full end-to-end process by design.
As an example, the Snapshot application from Progressive Insurance,4 a US-based 
insurance company, allows drivers to receive discounts on their monthly policy pay­
ments based on how they actually drive as opposed to traditional factors such as where 
they live and the kind of car they drive. The Snapshot device fits into the car’s on-board 
diagnostics (OBD)-II port. For each trip the driver makes, Snapshot records information 
about the time of day, distance driven, and any hard acceleration or braking events and 
sends it to Progressive’s central repository. 
To calculate potential savings, Progressive looks at items such as how often the driver 
accelerates or brakes rapidly (defined as accelerations or decelerations faster than 
7mph/second), how many miles they drive each day, and also how often they drive 
51

MASTERING DIGITAL BUSINESS
between midnight and 4 a.m., which is a particularly risky time for accidents. Drivers 
can then log in to an online application to see their results and receive feedback on how 
to become an even safer driver.
From a ‘tech combinations’ perspective, the application combines technology elements 
of a mobile device, extensive data analytics, a cloud-based application, and ‘badges’ for 
good driving which can be shared via the driver’s social networks. Progressive takes the 
social element even further by awarding a ‘Best Driver Ever’ title to the driver with the 
biggest potential Snapshot savings percentage. The driver’s ‘context’ clearly comes into 
play in this example, since the entire application is focused on actual driving behaviour 
as monitored in real time by the Snapshot device.
As we’ll see in Chapter 8, ‘Enhancing the digital customer experience’, next-generation 
applications may well include one or more additional enablers as follows:
yy IoT – To enable users and applications to access and physically control IoT 
devices in both consumer and industrial scenarios.
yy Wearables – To enable users and applications to take advantage of wearable 
devices such as smart glasses and smart watches in terms of hands-free 
process optimisation and convenience.
yy Intelligent automation – To deliver smart services by applying intelligent analytics 
and algorithms, including artificial intelligence (AI), to understand and anticipate 
the customers’ likely needs based upon their context and historical behaviour.
As an example, the RingTM Video Doorbell5 is essentially an IoT device that lets home­
owners answer the door from anywhere using a wireless video doorbell. The device 
includes motion sensors, a high definition (HD) camera, a microphone and speakers, in 
addition to the actual physical doorbell, letting homeowners receive mobile alerts when 
movement is detected or when the doorbell is pressed. Homeowners can then see and 
speak with visitors from anywhere via an app on their smartphone. In addition, Ring’s 
partnerships with a number of electronic lock companies enable homeowners to unlock 
their front doors to allow visitors to enter while they are away.
In terms of ‘tech combinations’, Ring uses an IoT device, a mobile app, video recording 
in the cloud, as well as allowing users to share access with additional users by simply 
entering their email address. When multiple users are connected to the Ring Doorbell, 
all users are notified of activity via push notifications. As per our earlier Snapshot 
example, we see the familiar combination of SMAC technologies, but with the addition 
of multiple IoT devices in this smart home scenario. 
We’ll explore strategies for enhancing the digital customer experience in more detail in 
Chapter 8. The key point here, however, is that various technology enablers can come 
together to deliver a completely new customer experience and set of capabilities (i.e. 
new services) that taps into the power, simplicity and convenience that each one of 
these enablers has to offer. Traditional business processes, such as car insurance and 
home security in these specific examples, have been re-thought and re-designed in the 
context of the new art of the possible these technologies enable. 
52

THE NEW PLATFORM ECOSYSTEM FOR DIGITAL BUSINESS
While SMAC capabilities are now expected by default in leading consumer applications, 
the new competitive battleground will be fought with new weaponry that taps into the 
power of personas and context, wearables and AR, the IoT and intelligent automation.
Transforming the digital workplace
When we think about transforming the digital workplace, we see a similar set of technol­
ogy enablers as we saw for improving the digital customer experience. The building 
blocks for next-generation applications typically include SMAC technologies together 
with one or more enablers such as IoT, wearables and AR, and intelligent automation. 
In the IoT arena, radio frequency identification (RFID) tags have long been used for 
high-value asset tracking particularly in supply chain scenarios in the military as 
well as commercial operations. You may well remember the famous ‘RFID mandates’ 
from vendors such as Walmart as well as the US Department of Defense back in the 
early 2000s. As one of the early IoT ‘devices’ on the market all those years ago, RFID 
tags provided the identity, description and location of an object – at the item, case and 
pallet level – as well as having the ability to capture and share other readings such 
as temperature, pressure and shock throughout the object’s journey along the supply 
chain. 
Much of this supply chain focus around RFID at the time was directed towards supply 
chain optimisation in terms of minimising the so-called ‘bull-whip effect’, where retailers 
and distributors carry too much inventory in excess of demand. In other scenarios, RFID 
tags can help to support anti-counterfeiting efforts by providing a unique ID for the item, 
such as certain classes of pharmaceuticals, and additional sensors can help to ensure 
that items such as perishable goods are kept within their environmental tolerances 
while in transit. 
Today, new IoT applications are emerging in the workplace to digitally optimise work 
processes and provide instant information and total recall for next-generation workers 
and employers. Many of these applications are designed to track and monitor worker 
behaviour for a variety of health and wellbeing, safety and efficiency goals. 
As an example, the connected police officer of the future may use a variety of IoT devices 
and sensors to detect environmental hazards, provide biometric health monitoring, 
monitor his or her gun holster to detect when the weapon is drawn, and capture and 
stream live video. Back in 2015, the UK’s Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) started the 
largest urban trial of body worn video (BWV) use in the world, incorporating the use 
of 500 cameras by response officers and 500 cameras being used within specialist 
roles such as Firearms, Tactical Support Group, Dog units and Traffic. The MPS is now 
expanding these deployments to all frontline police officers via a three-year contract to 
provide 22,000 BWV devices, which was awarded in late 2015.6 
The ‘tech combinations’ in the connected police officer scenario may include IoT devices 
such as BWV cameras, environmental sensors, biomonitoring sensors and gun holster 
sensors, as well as wearables such as smart glasses, mobile devices of various form 
factors, and data analytics. 
53

MASTERING DIGITAL BUSINESS
In the wearables arena, devices such as smart glasses and smart watches are 
particularly suited to scenarios such as understanding and navigating the physical 
environment, providing detailed guidance for complex manual tasks, supporting military 
and intelligence operations, and facilitating instant information and collaboration. We’ll 
explore each of these scenarios in more detail in Chapter 9, ‘Transforming the digital 
workplace’, as well as looking at how wearables can be used to enhance the shopping 
experience for consumers. 
An example of where wearables can provide the next level of hands-free process 
optimisation in terms of detailed guidance for complex manual tasks is within large 
warehouses where workers need guidance finding, picking and shipping products 
from inventory. In 2015, global logistics provider DHL conducted a pilot in one of their 
warehouses in the Netherlands using smart glasses and AR. They used the smart 
glasses as part of a ‘vision picking’ pilot and found reduced error rates in the warehouse 
picking process and overall efficiency improvements of up to 25 per cent.7 In the pilot, 
warehouse staff were guided through the warehouse by graphics displayed on their 
smart glasses to speed up the picking process and reduce errors. 
In terms of ‘tech combinations’ the DHL vision picking example utilised smart glasses, 
together with an AR application integrated with warehouse management software. The 
application replaced traditional handheld scanners and paper job orders, so it can be 
considered a ‘mobile upgrade’, in terms of the four different forms of mobile process 
re-design we explored in Chapter 2, moving from first generation mobile technology 
solution to a second generation solution. 
Intelligent automation is another area of significant opportunity in transforming the 
digital workplace and has been the subject of considerable media attention due to its 
implications on future jobs. We’re already seeing the convergence of human–machine 
work processes, where humans are becoming increasingly instrumented and machines 
are becoming increasingly connected with humans to create an optimised blend of 
human–machine participation and interaction.
Cognitive systems and intelligent automation techniques are reducing costs and 
dependence on labour-based processes and optimising service efficiency. Advances in 
machine learning, expert systems and robotics are leading to automation opportunities 
in both virtual (that is, software) and physical scenarios. 
A relevant software-based example is the emerging role of what are known as ‘cognitive 
virtual agents’ or ‘virtual engineers’ in the next-generation call centre. These agents 
interface on human terms in natural language. They think, speak and learn on the job – 
improving business processes and making better-informed decisions. A recent example 
is IPSoft’s Amelia technology, which is being used to transform the IT operations labour 
mix with digital labour costing one-third of the typical human FTE cost. 
We’ll explore strategies for transforming the digital workplace in more detail in Chapter 
9. The key point again here is that various technology enablers can come together 
to deliver completely new opportunities to improve employee health and wellbeing, 
safety, collaboration and productivity, while at the same time reducing costs through 
automation and minimising risk through improved monitoring and management. One of 
54

THE NEW PLATFORM ECOSYSTEM FOR DIGITAL BUSINESS
the issues, of course, is that some of these scenarios may raise concerns with regard to 
job security and privacy, so this must be carefully considered before rushing in. 
Optimising digital infrastructure and simplifying management
As the IT industry moves into the next wave of corporate IT, built upon the founda­
tion of SMAC, the data centre of the future needs to embrace this new paradigm for 
the digitisation of business models and processes, with the data centre becoming 
the workhorse that hosts, manages and delivers this compelling new experience for 
end-user computing.
Today’s data centres no longer reside in a small number of physical locations, but are 
becoming highly virtualised and highly distributed as organisations move to a hybrid IT 
approach that combines the best aspects of on-premise, outsourced, public and private 
cloud environments. This approach enables CIOs and data centre managers to place 
application workloads where they are most effective based on considerations related 
to their financial, performance and security requirements.
At the same time as the data centre needs to deliver a new generation of SMAC-enabled 
applications to digital consumers, and to the digital workforce, it also needs to embrace 
the changes occurring within data centre technologies themselves. In recent years, 
there have been a number of technology innovations relating to data centre operations 
and management that have helped to optimise data centre processes through enhanced 
automation, abstraction and security including:
yy Fabric computing architectures – By adopting a fabric-based architecture, 
organisations can gain the agility and flexibility of shared resource pools such 
as compute, network and storage. This helps to avoid data centre sprawl, where 
each mission-critical application used to have its own dedicated physical server, 
and helps to speed deployments and reduce costs. 
yy Software-defined principles – By adopting software-defined principles and 
applying them to the management of applications, infrastructure (such as 
networks and storage) and even security, organisations can implement a 
single, software-defined management approach across all environments and 
eliminate the need for many time-consuming, labour-based activities such as 
network and firewall configuration. 
yy SDDC – The concept of software-defined principles has given rise to software 
defined networks (SDNs) as well as the broader concept of the SDDC, where 
compute, network and storage resources are all software defined.
yy Cloud management – By adopting advanced automation tools that extend across 
their hybrid cloud infrastructures, organisations can reduce their operational 
and infrastructure costs, and selectively run workloads in the infrastructure 
best suited to meet their financial, performance and security requirements.
yy Security – By adopting security technologies that focus on securing communities 
of interest as opposed to securing the traditional ‘perimeter’, organisations can 
change the security paradigm and take a more dynamic, software-defined 
approach that enhances overall manageability.
55

MASTERING DIGITAL BUSINESS
For the CIO and data centre manager, it’s therefore no longer just about taking a hybrid 
IT approach across various deployment environments to optimise application perfor­
mance, but it’s also about taking advantage of the cost and agility benefits of these 
emerging platform and infrastructural technologies, such as converged infrastructures, 
fabrics, SDNs and, ultimately, SDDCs.
In terms of ‘tech combinations’ for their future data centres, CIOs are therefore looking 
at a combination of enablers consisting of those mentioned above, together with new 
cloud and hybrid IT, intelligent automation and cyber security technologies. The goal is 
to retain the mission-critical capabilities of their traditional data centres, yet expand 
this to support modern, digitally transformed business processes and their associated 
users, applications and devices.
As we saw earlier, common groupings of services can address specific business 
objectives and accelerate time-to-market. Rather than build out every foundational 
element, you may be able to find off-the-shelf capabilities where the various technology 
enablers have been pre-integrated and pre-packaged so you can put them to work 
immediately. For example, you may find a SDDC capability that has already pre-integrated 
the traditional SDDC components of ‘compute’, ‘network’ and ‘storage’ with additional 
elements such as software-defined security and software-defined management. 
In addition to build versus buy considerations for the future data centre, CIOs also have 
the option of tapping into external services delivered as-a-service in the cloud. This is a 
growing trend for CIOs to wish to focus less on managing IT and more on innovating with 
the business. As a result, rather than a few physical buildings equipped with hundreds 
of servers, the data centre of the future will be highly distributed and highly virtualised 
and will tap into specific services offered by a broad array of partners and providers. 
We’ll explore the emerging requirements for the data centre of the future, as well as 
enabling technologies, strategies and executive recommendations in more detail in 
Chapter 11, ‘Optimising digital infrastructure and simplifying management’.
Strategy considerations
When we think about these various target business objectives, ranging from enhancing 
the digital customer experience, to transforming the digital workplace, to optimising 
digital infrastructure and simplifying management, the questions and considerations 
are numerous: 
yy How should corporate innovation programmes be fine-tuned for digital 
transformation?
yy How can you quickly identify and prioritise opportunities for digital initiatives?
yy How can you time your move into a specific disruptive technology?
yy What are the key elements of the digital customer experience?
yy What are the future human–machine work scenarios? 
yy How do you optimise hand-offs between humans and machines in the future 
workplace?
56

THE NEW PLATFORM ECOSYSTEM FOR DIGITAL BUSINESS
yy What digital technologies and platforms should an organisation build versus 
buy?
yy What is the best way to jump-start transformation of the data centre?
In Parts II and III of this book, we’ll address each of these questions as we deep-dive into 
how to lead and organise for digital transformation and how to plan your digital strate­
gies for specific target business outcomes. 
EXPLOITING THE POWER OF ECOSYSTEM BUSINESS MODELS 
Just as there’s a dominant technology platform for digital business, comprised of a 
set of foundational emerging and disruptive technologies, there’s also a dominant new 
business model emerging in the form of digital business ecosystems. In terms of defini­
tions around a dominant new business model, we need to look at both the definition of 
a ‘digital ecosystem’ as well as the definition of a ‘digital platform’. Digital ecosystems 
can be defined as a network of organisations involved in the production and consump­
tion of digital business services by way of competition and collaboration. Within this 
overall ecosystem, where there is competition among entities, there may also be 
specific ecosystem communities that have come together, by design, to compete using 
their collective capabilities. These digital ecosystems may be wired together in various 
configurations with a platform model being one instance where there is a dominant 
platform provider serving as the focal point for the other providers and consumers. 
Platforms are defined in the book Platform Revolution by Parker, Van Alstyne and 
Choudary as follows:
A platform is a business based on enabling value-creating interactions between 
external producers and consumers. The platform provides an open, participative 
infrastructure for these interactions and sets governance conditions for them. 
The platform’s overarching purpose: to consummate matches among users and 
facilitate the exchange of goods, services, or social currency, thereby enabling 
value creation for all participants.
Digital business ecosystems and platforms are fast becoming the go-to business model 
for the digital economy. According to Accenture,8 ‘Ecosystems are the new bedrock of 
digital’ and ‘The top 15 public platform companies already represent $2.6 trillion in 
market capitalization worldwide.’ 
Examples of platform companies include Airbnb, Alibaba, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, 
Facebook, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Netflix, Salesforce, Tencent, Twitter and Uber, among 
many others. All these companies have established platforms where value is exchanged 
between parties in the form of products, services or social currency. In addition, many, 
if not all, have built an ecosystem around their platform business model whereby 
additional ecosystem partners add to the platform’s overall value proposition with 
primary or secondary value-added products and services. 
Take, for example, Apple’s iOS platform business model. The platform is centred on 
their iOS mobile operating system for products such as the iPhone, iPad and iPod, with 
57

MASTERING DIGITAL BUSINESS
value provided to end users through services directly from Apple, such as the intrinsic 
technology features built into their devices, as well as content and services from Apple’s 
ecosystem of partners in the form of third-party content providers and app developers. 
The Apple model can therefore be considered a platform business model with an 
ecosystem approach generating tremendous ‘network effects’ in terms of value for end 
users and revenues for the company. 
Companies from non-technology sectors are rapidly building and deploying platform 
business models as well. Examples include those of Bosch (Bosch Software Innovations), 
Disney (MagicBands), GE (Predix), Merck (Global Health Innovation) and Schneider 
Electric (Wonderware) to name just a few.
GE’s Predix platform is an interesting example where GE offers what they term ‘the 
world’s first industrial operating system’. Predix is a cloud-based operating system and 
platform 
for building applications that connect to industrial assets, collect and analyze 
data, and deliver real-time insights for optimizing industrial infrastructure and 
operations.9 
The platform offers extensive data management and analytics capabilities as well as 
the economics of a centrally managed and shared infrastructure in a pay-as-you-go 
subscription model. Some of the use cases supported by Predix include:
yy scheduling and logistics;
yy connected products;
yy intelligent cities;
yy field force management;
yy industrial analytics;
yy asset performance management;
yy operations optimisation.
According to GE, some of the benefits of their platform model include the ability for 
developers to build apps quickly, leverage work elsewhere, reduce sources of error, 
develop and share best practices, lower risk of cost and time overruns, and future-proof 
their initial investments. In addition, 
independent third parties can also build apps and services on the platform, allow­
ing businesses to extend capabilities easily by tapping the industrial ecosystem.10
The power of the platform: rapid scale
One of the reasons platform business models are so successful and so highly valued by 
the financial markets is that since they typically provide the base digital infrastructure 
(that is, the ‘platform’) and rely on external producers and consumers to provide the 
actual – physical or digital – products, services and social currency, they can scale up 
and achieve critical mass very quickly. As they grow, they also benefit from so-called 
58

THE NEW PLATFORM ECOSYSTEM FOR DIGITAL BUSINESS
‘network effects’, as more participants on the platform increase the volume and variety 
of products, services and social currency and correspondingly increase the value propo­
sition for all involved. This creates a virtuous cycle, which spurs further growth of the 
platform.
As an example, despite owning no physical assets, taxi service Uber famously reached 
a market capitalisation of over $50 billion in less than five years.11 Equally, home-
rental service Airbnb has been valued at over $25 billion,12 despite owning no rental 
properties itself. This rapid scaling in capability is something that would be impossible 
for traditional players using traditional techniques, which require heavy investments in 
physical assets and infrastructure. 
This leads us to an interesting point. In addition to being able to scale rapidly due to 
network effects as they grow, platform business models also gain rapid traction since 
they offer a more efficient digital business model and corresponding set of digital 
processes. As we saw in Chapter 2, the strategic options for digital business models 
include digitising products and services, to running or participating within industry 
platforms, to tapping into the sharing economy and crowdsourcing, to reshaping value 
networks, to creating new models for monetisation. 
Many of the most successful platform companies are incorporating many of these 
elements into their models so that they’re not just operating a platform, but are digitising 
or partially digitising the process, tapping into the sharing economy and reshaping 
the traditional value chain all at once. These changes allow them to deliver a highly 
compelling value proposition for customers where the digital customer experience has 
been completely re-imagined. 
The power of the ecosystem: aggregating and integrating value propositions
Both consumer and industrial ecosystems are driven by customers demanding more 
intuitive, real-time, integrated solutions and services whether in financial services, 
manufacturing, transportation, health care, entertainment, the public sector or any other 
industry vertical. 
By addressing a continuum of needs along the customer journey, companies operating as 
part of a business ecosystem can expand their addressable market and simultaneously 
deliver greater value in terms of the digital customer experience and overall value 
proposition. 
In the world of digital business ecosystems, you may no longer be playing solely in 
your traditional markets. Organisations need to think about the end-to-end customer 
journey in specific scenarios and the discrete value propositions that can be aggregated 
together via the ecosystem or platform.
In air travel, this might involve thinking about the overall passenger experience that 
cuts across airlines, airports, car rental agencies and hotels. In the automotive world, 
this might involve thinking about the future of self-driving cars and implications on 
roadside service, insurance and other traditional services that can be re-imagined and 
re-designed.

MASTERING DIGITAL BUSINESS
As an example, the RAC is the UK’s leading motoring services company. Its recent acqui­
sition of vehicle diagnostics specialists Nebula Systems13 shows it’s thinking about 
next-generation services for motorists that extends its business model from a reactive, 
labour-based model to a more pro-active, digitally enabled ‘predictive breakdown ser­
vice’. By acquiring and partnering with high-tech companies, the RAC is enhancing its 
ecosystem to react to the evolving needs of its members.
Strategy considerations
According to Ralph Welborn, CEO at Imaginatik, an innovation management software 
provider, 
Business ecosystems are no aberration; nor are they a surprise. They represent an 
inevitable, adaptive response to changes in the types of value that folks care about 
and the interplay of technology innovation, behavioural expectations, regulatory 
changes and novel business models.14 
By 2018, IDC predicts that more than 50 per cent of large enterprises – and more than 
80 per cent of enterprises with advanced digital transformation strategies – ‘will create 
and/or partner with industry platforms’.15 All this leads to a number of important con­
siderations in terms of how organisations need to think about strategy and innovation 
in the years ahead. 
On the business strategy side, the questions and considerations are numerous: 
yy What percentage of investment should go into ecosystem business models? 
yy What types of ecosystems should be considered? 
yy When should an organisation choose a hub versus spoke strategy? 
yy What is an appropriate pricing strategy that will spur growth of the ecosystem 
or platform? 
yy Should an organisation hedge its bets by playing within competing ecosystems? 
yy What sustainable competitive advantage and differentiation can be gained from 
an ecosystem model versus a traditional value chain-oriented business model? 
The implications on strategy and execution also ripple back to corporate innovation. 
Just as corporate strategic planning will need to respond to the new environment (that 
is, the growing ecosystem and platform economy), so too will corporate innovation pro­
grammes. 
On the IT strategy side, the questions and considerations are equally numerous:
yy What’s the right value proposition to attract developers to the platform?
yy What open standards, APIs and other technical capabilities are required for 
ease of onboarding?
yy What key infrastructural services should be provided?
yy What cloud platforms can scale sufficiently as the number of participants grows?
60

THE NEW PLATFORM ECOSYSTEM FOR DIGITAL BUSINESS
yy Where should data reside in light of geographic and legal considerations?
yy What security model will best support the platform model and full set of 
participants?
The early signs are that most players in the platform economy are starting with a 
robust and scalable cloud platform, incorporating open standards and APIs to aid with 
onboarding and integration of developers and partners, incorporating governance to 
establish the operating rules for the platform, and then adding in data management and 
analytics services to provide value-added services for participants.
For organisations in non-technology sectors, all of this can be more difficult than it 
may initially appear. Companies such as Microsoft and Apple made onboarding for their 
third-party developers very easy with a wealth of training, education, developer kits 
and APIs. According to Peter C. Evans, Vice President, The Center for Global Enterprise, 
there are some large differences between consumer-facing and industrial platforms. 
Apps can be tricky to deploy, due to complexity and data compatibility issues. In addition, 
developers themselves can be tricky to onboard, due to the less attractive nature of 
industrial applications and the requirement for deeper domain expertise. 
To explore the challenges and opportunities presented by industrial platforms further, 
in our case study below we take an in-depth look at the broad set of requirements 
spelled out by the Industry 4.0 Working Group for the German vision for the future of 
manufacturing. While Industry 4.0 is still a futuristic vision, it helps to show the end 
game that many platform business models are aiming towards in terms of digitally 
transforming their entire industries. 
CASE STUDY – INDUSTRY 4.0
Building on the new platform for digital business
When exploring digital business ecosystems and platforms, Industry 4.0 (aka Industrie 
4.0) – the German vision for the future of manufacturing – is an interesting example 
because it taps into a broad array of foundational technologies as well as a broad array 
of smart factories, smart products and ‘the Internet of Things, People and Services’ 
across its ecosystem. 
When thinking about the Industrial Internet and Industry 4.0, one tends to gravitate 
towards the IoT, and perhaps data analytics, as the key underlying technologies. How­
ever, more than just the IoT and big data/fast data/data analytics, the real potential of 
the Industrial Internet and Industry 4.0 will be realised by the holistic combination of 
a far broader set of technology enablers to deliver ‘dynamic, real-time optimized, self-
organizing value chains’. 
The vision articulated by the Industrie 4.0 Working Group in their ‘Recommendations 
for implementing the strategic initiative INDUSTRIE 4.0’ is a useful example to see 
how these elements all come together in a powerful combination to enable the fourth 
industrial revolution.16 icon
61

MASTERING DIGITAL BUSINESS
Vision of Industry 4.0 
‘Industry 4.0’ was coined by representatives from German industry, research, indus­
trial associations and industrial unions. The number 4.0 refers to the fourth industrial 
revolution – the theme of the 2016 annual general meeting of the World Economic 
Forum – and is represented by cyber-physical production systems (CPS) that combine 
communications, IT, data and physical elements in collaborative inter-company eco­
systems. Industry 4.0 specifically focuses on manufacturing, whereas the Industrial 
Internet is of course focused on a broader range of industries. 
The vision of Industry 4.0 is to deliver ‘greater flexibility and robustness together with 
the highest quality standards in engineering, planning, manufacturing, operational, and 
logistics processes’. The idea is that customers benefit from faster innovation cycles 
and individualised mass production (that is, ‘lot size of 1’), and manufacturers can 
shorten time-to-market and optimise and change their processes with ease. 
Companies digitising their manufacturing processes expect to increase flexibility 
and responsiveness, improve quality and reduce defects, and increase efficiency and 
reduce costs. In fact, a study on Industry 4.0 by PwC indicates that manufacturers 
expect to achieve up to 18% in increased efficiency and 14% in cost savings by 2020.17 
Foundational technologies 
A key aspect of the technology vision behind Industry 4.0 is that it incorporates far more 
than just IoT components and big data analytics. In fact, it draws on the same set of 
foundational technologies that you’ll see in many next-generation blueprints for digital 
business platforms as per our earlier model. 
Some of the key elements include personas and context, social business, mobility and 
wearables, big data analytics, cloud and hybrid IT, intelligent automation, IoT and cyber 
security, as shown in Figure 4.1. In the illustration, I’ve shown our model for the new 
platform for digital business and have highlighted the key requirements for Industry 
4.0 – as specified in the Industrie 4.0 Working Group recommendations – alongside. 
The Industry 4.0 vision clearly taps into all these foundational technologies and more. 
Ecosystem approach
The ultimate goal from a manufacturing standpoint is to enable continuous resource 
productivity and efficiency gains to be delivered across the entire value network (that 
is, ecosystem), incorporating smart factories and smart products, as well as the IoT, 
people and services.
According to the Working Group, smart factories are 
embedded into inter-company value networks and characterized by end-to-
end engineering that encompasses both the manufacturing process and the 
manufactured product.

MASTERING DIGITAL BUSINESS
Smart products are 
uniquely identifiable and locatable at all times. Even while they are being 
made, they know the details of their own manufacturing process. 
One of the key takeaways here is that while the IoT constitutes a complex ecosystem 
in and of itself, the full vision of Industry 4.0, and by extension the Industrial Internet, 
will incorporate an even broader ecosystem of technology enablers and industry par­
ticipants. 
More than IoT sensors, devices, gateways, middleware, applications and data, it’s 
important to design for the next evolution of human–machine collaboration and to work 
in the appropriate technology enablers related to personas and context, social col­
laboration and mobile applications to enable ‘unprecedented communications between 
parts to be created, other components, companies, and end users’ in this highly dis­
tributed model. 
As the Industry 4.0 working group puts it, the vision will be characterised by a ‘new 
level of socio-technical interaction between all the actors and resources involved in 
manufacturing’. 
With the broad scope of Industry 4.0, within the logical architecture, there will be many 
different organisations and partners each providing specific products and services. 
This will need to include the integration of applications and systems that span the 
factory floor, controls and automation, manufacturing execution systems and enter­
prise resource planning as well as a robust base layer of horizontal capabilities such 
as information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure, cloud technology 
and services, big data analytics, mobile technologies and security, among others. 
Challenges and opportunities
Many challenges lie ahead, including sizeable hurdles related to security as well as 
interoperability. Organisations such as the Industrial Internet Consortium18 are helping 
to tackle these challenges via their reference architectures and test beds, and this will 
help to accelerate market momentum. 
As these initial barriers to adoption start to become addressed, and with a solid vision 
and blueprint for the requisite technology enablers to help shape the ‘big picture’, the 
next step for enterprise organisations wishing to move to the vision of Industry 4.0 and 
the Industrial Internet will be mapping out a strategic roadmap for transformation. 
The opportunities for those organisations who either lead or embed themselves within 
the new industry ecosystems will be as profound and rewarding as they were for the 
organisations who made similar transitions into the first, second and third industrial 
revolutions related to mechanisation, mass production, and computers and automation 
respectively.

KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR CHAPTER 4
yy While SMAC capabilities are now expected by default in leading consumer 
applications, the new competitive battleground will be fought with new 
weaponry that taps into the power of personas and context, wearables and 
AR, the IoT and intelligent automation.
yy Just as there’s a dominant technology platform for digital business, 
comprised of a set of foundational emerging and disruptive technologies, 
there’s also a dominant new business model emerging in the form of digital 
business ecosystems.
yy By addressing a continuum of needs along the customer journey, companies 
operating as part of a business ecosystem can expand their addressable 
market and simultaneously deliver greater value in terms of the digital 
customer experience and overall value proposition. 
yy It is the mix of disruptive technologies and platform business models, 
together with a mastery of digital services – in terms of how digital services 
are designed, developed, deployed, managed and continually evolved – that 
really sets today’s digital business leaders head and shoulders above the 
rest of the field. These elements are therefore at the heart of truly mastering 
digital business and crafting a successful strategy and roadmap for the 
years ahead.
yy While the IoT constitutes a complex ecosystem in and of itself, the full vision 
of Industry 4.0, and by extension the Industrial Internet, will incorporate an 
even broader ecosystem of technology enablers and industry participants.
yy The opportunities for organisations who either lead or embed themselves 
within new industry ecosystems, such as the Industrial Internet, will be 
as profound and rewarding as they were for the organisations who made 
similar transitions into the first, second and third industrial revolutions 
related to mechanisation, mass production, and computers and automation.

ORGANISING AND ADAPTING 
CORPORATE INNOVATION PROCESSES 
FOR DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION
Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower.

Steve Jobs1
In one form or another, most organisations have had a corporate innovation programme 
for many years now. Today’s innovation objectives, however, are all gravitating towards 
digital transformation. This chapter provides leadership guidance on how to change and 
fine-tune an existing corporate innovation programme to most effectively support digital 
transformation both now and in the years to come.
THE FIVE CRITICAL PILLARS OF INNOVATION MANAGEMENT CAPABILITY
Before we look at how to change and fine-tune an existing corporate innovation 
programme to set the sights squarely around digital transformation, it’s worth looking 
at the five critical pillars of corporate innovation management to help frame our under­
standing of the key capabilities a corporate innovation programme should provide.
While idea management is often the first item to come to mind when thinking about 
innovation, it’s actually just the tip of the iceberg. Corporate innovation programmes 
need to go beyond the table-stakes of idea management and provide a complete pro­
gramme addressing not only the innovation pipeline (that is, idea management), but the 
front-end of the innovation lifecycle in terms of ‘where to play’ and the back-end of the 
lifecycle in terms of ‘how to scale’. This is where innovation needs to be closely aligned 
with strategy and execution. 
Just like any other corporate programme, the key elements need to address strategy 
and intent, people, process and technology. Your innovation programme should also 
address the highly interrelated internal and external aspects of managing innovation 
and extend across employees, partners and customers.
Figure 5.1 shows the five critical pillars of innovation management capability that I 
believe need to be a part of any major initiative within mid-size to large organisations:
yy Innovation management and measurement.
yy Innovation infrastructure.
yy Internal innovation community.
69

MASTERING DIGITAL BUSINESS
yy Open innovation community. 
yy Customer innovation community.
Figure 5.1  The five critical pillars of innovation management capability 
Figure 5.1
Here’s an in-depth look at each of these areas.
1. Innovation management and measurement 
Key elements: innovation leadership and governance | innovation processes | 
innovation metrics and analytics
This is the strategy and intent portion of your innovation management approach that 
includes overall leadership and governance, innovation processes, and innovation 
metrics and analytics. According to David Sanders,2 founder of Dallas Advisory Partners, 
the top three ingredients for success that need to be in place from the beginning are 
executive leadership, enterprise programme management and change management. 
These are essential elements not just for corporate innovation programmes, but for any 
kind of transformational initiative. 
Core processes should include innovation frameworks (that is, process methodologies) 
for identifying, prioritising, incubating and commercialising innovative solutions and 
offerings, as well as measuring, monitoring and reporting on innovation metrics.
70

ORGANISING AND ADAPTING CORPORATE INNOVATION PROCESSES FOR DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION
The innovation process methodology should support what I term ‘multi-modal idea­
tion’ (that is, multi-modal idea generation) in terms of both event-based and ongoing 
ideation:
yy Event-based ideation (idea generation) – This ranges from large-scale, 
innovation events such as single- or multi-day, corporate-wide ‘innovation jams’, 
to innovation contests and partnerships with innovation labs, to laser-focused 
innovation workshops with a select group of subject matter experts (SMEs).
yy Ongoing ideation (idea generation) –  This ranges from corporate-wide 
suggestion boxes and innovation databases of various levels of sophistication, 
to more focused ideation processes typically aligned with corporate strategic 
communities, or corporate strategic planning cycles.
By supporting both event-based and ongoing ideation, your organisation will be 
well-poised to maximise the innovation potential across your diverse ecosystem of 
employees, customers, suppliers and partners in a systematic manner and equally 
able to mobilise high-targeted ideation sessions as, where and when opportunities 
arise.
In terms of metrics, there are literally hundreds of innovation metrics that can be meas­
ured by the typical organisation. By performing factor analysis on these metrics, it has 
been recognised by groups such as the Corporate Executive Board3 that they all come 
down to three basic areas of measurement: 
yy Innovation input and mix – What’s going into your innovation pipeline in 
terms of the types of innovations in the queue.
yy Innovation health and efficiency – The flow-rate through your pipeline and 
the amount of funding being applied.
yy Innovation outcomes – The measure of your return on innovation in terms 
of the number of innovations that have made it through to commercialisation 
and have captured revenues or other strategic or financial objectives.
2. Innovation infrastructure 
Key elements: innovation centres and labs | innovation portal and communities | 
innovation repositories and reporting | idea management software
This is the physical infrastructure and technology portion of your innovation manage­
ment approach that may include physical centres of excellence and innovation labs 
as well as software tools such as innovation portals, to support communication and 
collaboration among your various communities, together with innovation databases 
(that is, repositories) to support your process methodology for innovation. 
An innovation database can serve as the centralised repository to support the innova­
tion framework process and from which to draw reports and metrics that can be further 
analysed via an innovation dashboard. One of the key upfront requirements for any inno­
vation database is to define the scope of what’s included very carefully and to educate 
employees on the range of usage scenarios. 
71

MASTERING DIGITAL BUSINESS
An innovation database is typically the core idea management system for the organisa­
tion, helping you collect, manage and prioritise ideas, but it can also be extended to pro­
vide a broader view of future solutions for the organisation as well as a view of existing 
innovative assets and capabilities. 
A more extensive innovation database may therefore include:
1.	
Emerging trends and technologies that are on the radar.
2.	
Future solutions, offerings and ideas that constitute the next wave of 
solutions.
3.	
Existing assets and capabilities that have the potential for reuse across the 
organisation.
A key consideration within this pillar is to continually innovate around the use of the 
technologies themselves and incorporate newer elements such as ‘gamification’ (that is, 
the application of game-design elements and game principles) and advanced analytics 
to further fuel innovation activities and lend additional insights. 
While most innovation management software on the market today includes social and 
mobile features to assist with idea management via crowdsourcing and anytime, any­
where access, it’s important to look beyond these relatively commonplace features and 
look for more advanced capabilities that can help you to process large numbers of ideas 
in the most efficient manner. 
3. Internal innovation community 
Key elements: strategic communities | scouts and brokers | awards and recognition | 
training and education
This is the employee-facing portion of your innovation management approach that 
includes elements such as innovation councils, innovation communities of practice, 
scouts and brokers, award and recognition schemes, employee communications and 
training, and employee feedback mechanisms. 
Basically, scouts and brokers are formally assigned resources who search for opportu­
nities and then direct them to the appropriate parts of the organisation. To get everyone 
on the same page across your organisation, since ‘innovation’ typically means different 
things to different people, it’s important to come up with precise terminology for innova­
tion and to clearly spell out initiatives, roles and responsibilities to avoid duplication of 
effort or competition among internal groups. 
This programme area is vital to achieving corporate goals of institutionalising innova­
tion within the organisation and making innovation part of corporate DNA. As such, it 
requires continual care and feeding in order to engage employees and build success in 
step with the innovation maturity of the organisation. Employee communications and 
training are also vital ongoing tasks, which must be maintained and promoted year-
over-year to preserve organisational memory, to train new hires as they come on board, 
and to share and build upon success.
72

ORGANISING AND ADAPTING CORPORATE INNOVATION PROCESSES FOR DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION
4. Open innovation community
Key elements: partner research and development (R&D) programmes | innovation chal­
lenges | innovation consortia | best practice sharing
This is the external-facing portion of your innovation management approach that 
includes industry-recognised approaches such as open innovation and crowdsourcing 
for bringing in ideas from the outside, together with collaboration in various innovation 
consortia for best practice sharing.
Depending on your particular industry and organisation, this collaboration with custom­
ers and partners may constitute a large percentage of your sources of innovation and 
may be a central part of your innovation strategy. 
A good example of this is P&G’s ‘Connect + Develop’ program.4 Through their open 
innovation strategy, P&G has established more than 2,000 successful agreements with 
innovation partners around the world. Through their website, www.pgconnectdevelop.
com/, P&G enables current and potential partners to submit their ideas to P&G by, first, 
reviewing their innovation needs list, reviewing their criteria for submitting ideas, and 
then submitting their ideas related to innovative technologies, ready to go products or 
packaging, or commercial opportunities ‘that can help improve the lives of consumers 
around the world’.
Other activities within this programme area may include alliance partner R&D pro­
grammes, where organisations collaborate and work with alliance partners further 
upstream so they can gain insights into the innovations that are on the radars of their 
partners and co-create future solutions. 
5. Customer innovation community 
Key elements: continuous innovation | innovation briefings | innovation workshops | 
continual improvement
This is the customer-facing portion of your innovation management approach that 
includes all programme elements and activities that you make available to your 
customers. This may include co-innovation with customers on a continual basis, 
via mechanisms such as innovation councils, innovation briefings and innovation 
workshops, as well as innovation research via customer focus groups and feedback 
mechanisms. 
Continual and collaborative innovation with customers can help infuse innovation in two 
fundamental areas. The first is innovation within the current scope of your company's 
products and services, and the second is in helping them with innovation above and 
beyond the current scope of your relationship. 
If your customers are a major source of much of your product or service innovation, 
then this pillar may well be closely aligned with, or even an integral part of, the open 
innovation community pillar. 
73

MASTERING DIGITAL BUSINESS
If your external sources of innovation come mostly from partners, then you may find 
that two distinct pillars are beneficial so that you can manage and fine-tune each pro­
gramme area specifically for those constituents. 
However you organise, it’s likely that open innovation will be a common approach across 
all three ‘people’ pillars. 
Leading and organising across the five pillars
Overall, it’s important to manage across all five of these critical pillars of innovation 
management capability and to ensure they all connect into the appropriate corporate 
strategy, investment and product, and service development processes. 
According to Steve Hill,5 Global Head of Innovation and Investments at KPMG, the three 
people-oriented pillars are the most challenging yet most important part of driving an 
innovation management capability. It takes leadership to make innovation a necessity, 
to enforce behaviours, and to keep programmes chartered and aligned with the external 
perspective in mind. 
In organising for innovation, Ralph Welborn,6 CEO at Imaginatik, an innovation manage­
ment software provider, believes it is also important to ask what he believes is the ‘new 
strategic question’ of today – namely, where value is being created and destroyed within 
your ecosystem and, consequently, how to orchestrate your capabilities to respond. 
By taking a programmatic and holistic approach you can ensure that your innovation 
programme covers all strategic angles and can support and sustain innovation and con­
tribute to both your top and bottom lines. You’ll be able to engage in continual and col­
laborative innovation with customers, expand your sources of innovation, and accelerate 
their commercialisation into new products and services or differentiators for existing 
offerings.
ADAPTING INNOVATION PROGRAMMES FOR DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION
As companies pursue digital transformation initiatives, one of the strategic questions 
that often arises relates to the organisational model for programmatically managing 
these initiatives from strategy to execution. 
While it’s well recognised that digital transformation initiatives have to be a team sport, 
with sponsorship, involvement and collaboration of many key stakeholders from the 
CEO to the CMO, Chief Digital Officer (CDO) and Chief Technology Officer (CTO), another 
key consideration is the role of corporate innovation programmes. 
In one form or another, most organisations have had a corporate innovation programme 
for many years. Today’s innovation objectives, however, are all gravitating towards digi­
tal transformation. So how should an existing corporate innovation programme change 
or be fine-tuned to most effectively support digital transformation both now and in the 
years to come? 
74

ORGANISING AND ADAPTING CORPORATE INNOVATION PROCESSES FOR DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION
Figure 5.2 presents five key points, which I hope will provide some useful considerations 
and guidance. 
Figure 5.2  Key aspects of a finely tuned innovation programme supporting digital 
transformationFigure 5.2
1. First, regardless of how it’s organised, the innovation programme should 
deliver the transformative outcomes required of digital business
In some companies, such as many start-ups and well-recognised high-tech ‘innovators’, 
innovation is a core part of their corporate DNA and is simply embedded in the business. 
It’s viral across the organisation and a part of ‘business as usual’. Other organisations, 
particularly larger enterprises, often accelerate innovation by way of a structured 
programme. The various options include:
yy Specialised departments (e.g. traditional R&D departments, incubators and 
corporate venture groups).
yy The formation of dedicated business units around distinct growth horizons (for 
example, the three horizons framework featured in The alchemy of growth).7 
yy Creating hybrid models where innovation is collaboratively managed by 
multiple departments.
According to Steve Hill,8 there are two key areas to organise around innovation: one is 
embedded in the business and the other is distinct and protected from the business. In 
the first area, incremental innovation should occur within the business and support the 
kind of viral innovation that does not need heavy, top-down involvement. In the second 
area, disruptive innovation should be distinct from the business and have the protection 
and centralised funding it needs to succeed. 
The general idea is to carve out distinct business units or departments to focus on 
more disruptive opportunities and investments and to avoid The innovator’s dilemma.9 
Basically, 
successful companies can put too much emphasis on customers’ current needs, 
and fail to adopt new technology or business models that will meet customers’ 
unstated or future needs.

For both of these models, it’s important that the programmes deliver on the business 
outcomes they aim to realise. It’s therefore worth re-visiting the measurements and 
metrics around your innovation programme, and adjusting where necessary. As we saw 
earlier, a common approach to innovation metrics, based on extensive analysis by the 
Corporate Executive Board, is the pipeline model where you look at the pipeline mix (in 
terms of the sources, categories, quality and quantity of ideas flowing into the pipeline), 
the pipeline productivity and health (the flow-rate in terms of duration from initial idea to 
commercialisation, and the amount of funding provided) and the business outcomes (in 
terms of increased revenues, reduced costs, increased customer satisfaction and so on). 
In the era of digital business, you may want to accelerate (that is, shorten) your aver­
age cycle time for commercialisation or operationalisation and also change the relative 
mix of what goes into the pipeline, what gets commercialised and how you measure it. 
According to Steve Hill, the cycles of innovation are very different today and organisa­
tions can’t buy time at the expense of their long-term sustainability.
2. The innovation programme should adjust for the scope of digital 
transformation initiatives
The corporate innovation programme should contribute to delivering the desired 
business outcomes related to digital transformation. This means its focus may need to 
be adjusted in terms of the degree of innovation (that is, disruptive versus incremental) 
and the type of innovation (that is, business model, process, products, services and so on). 
It’s likely that your innovation programme already takes a holistic view across all these 
areas, so the change needed may just be in terms of relative priorities. For example, if 
your existing programme places equal emphasis on identifying and incubating highly 
disruptive ideas as well as more incremental ideas that can benefit your business, then 
you may just need to amplify the focus on the former. 
So, precisely what’s the right mix of disruptive versus incremental innovation to support 
digital transformation initiatives? According to Steve Hill, there’s no ideal mix since it 
will vary considerably from company to company and where they are in the ‘invest’, ‘sus­
tain’ and ‘harvest’ cycle within their business strategy. However, this is an interesting 
area for board member discussions since it takes the innovation strategy of a company 
beyond the typical ‘innovate/maintain’ investment mix discussion into specifics related 
to their more disruptive and transformative investments. 
3. The innovation programme should be driven by what’s important to 
customers 
Since the majority of digital transformation initiatives are focused on re-thinking and 
re-inventing business models and processes to improve the digital customer experi­
ence, it’s important that the innovation programme is driven by what’s impactful to 
customers. 
There are many ways to accomplish this alignment, ranging all the way from customer-
facing innovation workshops for collaborative innovation with your customers and 
76

ORGANISING AND ADAPTING CORPORATE INNOVATION PROCESSES FOR DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION
prospects, to how you score and prioritise your innovation initiatives, to how you con­
tinually adjust your programme based on customer feedback. 
What I’ve found in conducting hundreds of innovation workshops over the years is that 
customers are typically interested in two fundamental areas of innovation. The first is 
innovation within the current scope of your company's products and services, and the 
second is in helping them with innovation above and beyond the current scope of your 
relationship. 
They’re often interested in how your company can help them outside your current scope 
of work. What additional innovative ideas can you bring to the table to help them in their 
business? If your company is a business-to-consumer (B2C) operation, then the equiva­
lent question your customers may be asking is what else can you bring to them beyond 
your current product or service offerings. Going back to the innovator’s dilemma, they’re 
basically asking you about their unstated and future needs and providing a green light 
for you to collaborate with them. 
4. Ensure strong connections and innovation leadership within the business
Growth horizons for an organisation are usually described as horizon 1 (core products 
and services typically comprising 70 per cent of the company’s annual investment), 
horizon 2 (emerging businesses and adjacencies typically comprising 20 per cent 
of the company’s annual investment) and horizon 3 (new, transformational initia­
tives and ‘viable options’ typically comprising 10 per cent of the company’s annual 
investment). 
As your latest product or service innovations gain traction in the market and mature 
over time, they often move from horizon 3 – where they’re initially incubated – to hori­
zon 2, and then horizon 1 where they become a mainstream source of revenue for the 
organisation. This may well involve a transition of these innovations from your innova­
tion centres or ‘skunkworks’ into the core parts of the business. 
According to Steve Hill, as you transition these innovations to the business, it’s impor­
tant to know your innovation leaders. You need to know who’s in the business, whether 
or not they’re pre-disposed to be innovative and if it’s in their job description and per­
formance objectives. If all the above are in place, you can then measure the business, 
and its leaders, in terms of their ability to drive innovation. 
A recent study from the Corporate Executive Board, confirms Mr Hill’s position. It found 
that leadership quality impacts innovation potential. In fact, it found that staff of effec­
tive managers had a 34 per cent higher ‘innovation potential’ score on average, and that 
most companies’ performance management systems did not identify or reward the 
competencies that had the largest impact on innovation potential: namely ‘risk taker’, 
‘customer empathiser’, ‘idea integrator’, ‘influencer’ and ‘results seeker’. 
5. The innovation programme itself should be digitally transformed 
Finally, the innovation programme itself should be digitally transformed. Just like any 
long-term initiative within an organisation, it needs to continually evolve and adapt 
77

MASTERING DIGITAL BUSINESS
to meet the needs of the business at any specific time. Elements of your innovation 
programme may come and go year-over-year, based on their level of adoption and 
benefits realised by the corporation. Some examples are elements such as innovation 
portals, databases, communities, scouts and brokers and so on. You can expect these 
to constantly evolve and adapt. 
The elements that have the best longevity are typically those that are designed to allow 
for intrinsic customisation. As an example, innovation workshops that have a method­
ology and toolset designed to allow for a high degree of customisation in terms of the 
key focus areas for each workshop can easily support a wide range of workshop topics 
and objectives over time. 
While the content of the innovation ideas that flow through each workshop may be very 
different, the design principle should be such that the structured approach and toolset 
within the workshop methodology can be consistent and provide the necessary levels 
of quality, consistency and repeatability.
To digitally transform your innovation programme, you can apply the same thinking 
that you apply to your externally focused innovation activities. For example, think about 
how the SMAC stack can enable stronger social collaboration, mobile access, improved 
analytics and cost-effective and agile cloud delivery. Think about how innovation pro­
cesses can be re-designed to be more customer facing and produce results within 
faster cycle times. 
Adapting your innovation programme
Taken as a whole, you’ll see that the innovation programme should be re-visited in light 
of your digital transformation objectives in terms of how it’s measured, what types of 
innovation you focus on and their relative priorities, where and when you create key 
touch points with your customers, which business unit leaders you collaborate with to 
drive innovation and, finally, how you apply technology to transform your programme’s 
capabilities. By assessing and then fine-tuning all these variables, you’ll be able to 
maximise your digital business outcomes in the years ahead.

KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR CHAPTER 5
yy Corporate innovation programmes need to go beyond the table-stakes  
of idea management and provide a complete programme addressing not 
only the innovation pipeline (that is, idea management), but the front-end 
of the innovation lifecycle in terms of ‘where to play’ and the back-end of 
the lifecycle in terms of ‘how to scale’. This is where innovation needs to be 
closely aligned with strategy and execution. 
yy The five critical pillars of innovation management capability include 
innovation management and measurement, innovation infrastructure, 
internal innovation community, open innovation community, and customer 
innovation community.
yy The three people-oriented pillars are the most challenging yet most 
important part of driving an innovation management capability. It takes 
leadership to make innovation a necessity, to enforce behaviours, and to 
keep programmes chartered and aligned with the external perspective in 
mind.
yy Innovation programmes should be re-visited in light of your digital 
transformation objectives in terms of how they are measured, what types 
of innovation you focus on and their relative priorities, where and when 
you create key touch points with your customers, which business unit 
leaders you collaborate with to drive innovation, and finally how you apply 
technology to transform your programme’s capabilities.

IDENTIFYING AND PRIORITISING 
OPPORTUNITIES WITH INNOVATION 
WORKSHOPS
Software innovation, like almost every other kind of innovation, requires the abil-
ity to collaborate and share ideas with other people, and to sit down and talk with 
customers and get their feedback and understand their needs. 

Bill Gates1
Innovation workshops provide a way for leaders to focus on innovation opportunity 
identification, categorisation, prioritisation and then the development of high-level 
business cases and implementation roadmaps for the most promising opportunities 
identified. In this chapter, we’ll explore the importance of both event-based and ongoing 
ideation – something we term ‘multi-modal ideation’ – and share the details of the five-
step Innovation Workshop methodology together with a set of best practices for running 
lean, high-performance sessions. The Innovation Workshop methodology, which we’ll 
explore, has been developed and refined over literally hundreds of innovation sessions 
with major corporations and government organisations worldwide. It can be utilised as 
a vital tool for identifying and prioritising digital business initiatives and gaining con­
sensus across key stakeholders. 
SETTING THE RHYTHM OF DIGITAL INNOVATION: EVENT-BASED AND 
ONGOING IDEATION
While ideation is a small part of an enterprise innovation programme, there’s many 
things to consider in terms of targeting your ideation activities to support both the tacti­
cal and strategic needs of the business as it relates to digital transformation. 
In terms of ideation tools and approaches, there’s certainly no shortage of options to 
choose from – ranging from enterprise software, to consultancies, to problem-solver 
networks, to innovation contests, to partnerships with innovation labs and start-ups, to 
open innovation with customers and partners and so on. As we saw earlier in Chapter 
5, the key consideration is that you’ll likely need a combination of both event-based 
ideation, as well as ongoing, enterprise-wide ideation processes as part of your overall 
innovation strategy: 
yy Event-based ideation – This ranges from large-scale, innovation events such 
as single- or multi-day, corporate-wide ‘innovation jams’, to innovation contests 
and partnerships with innovation labs, to laser-focused innovation workshops 
with a select group of subject matter experts SMEs. 
80

IDENTIFYING AND PRIORITISING OPPORTUNITIES WITH INNOVATION WORKSHOPS
yy Ongoing ideation – This ranges from corporate-wide suggestion boxes 
and innovation databases of various levels of sophistication, to more focused 
ideation processes typically aligned with corporate strategic communities, or 
corporate strategic planning cycles.
As you prepare to run a variety of ideation events and campaigns to generate digital 
business-related ideas and opportunities, a best practice to maximise results is to think 
about the pillars of strategy and intent, people, process, technology and continuous 
improvement as follows. 
Strategy and intent
Whether event-based or ongoing ideation, it’s important to ensure your ideation activi­
ties are complementary and suited to the task. Set clear goals and objectives and define 
your focus. A common understanding and precise definition of terms in your innovation 
vocabulary is essential. In addition, it’s important to have a common understanding 
about the types of innovation that are of interest – that is, business model, business 
process, technology – and also the level of innovation that’s of interest – that is, more 
incremental, tactical ideas or more disruptive, strategic ideas. 
Depending on your goals and objectives, you may want to focus more on one level of 
innovation or the other. It’s also perfectly fine to focus on both areas within an ideation 
session, since in many cases the goal is to come up with a set of ideas that can provide 
measurable business value regardless of whether they’re near-term tactical opportuni­
ties or longer-term, more strategic opportunities. 
People
When preparing an ideation session, it’s key to target the right audience in terms of 
participants. Is this a shotgun approach where you’re looking for general ideas from a 
large crowd, or more of a rifle shot where you’re looking for specific ideas from specific 
SMEs? Often, the key focus areas for your ideation session can help to drive the selec­
tion of the appropriate internal or external SMEs. 
In our innovation workshops, we’ve found that five to ten key focus areas (that is, categories 
for brainstorming) help to define the scope of the workshop and help to drive the selection 
of SMEs with the appropriate domain knowledge. This selection of the key focus areas is 
typically done well in advance of the session with the client or relevant stakeholder. 
For an Innovation Workshop focused on game-changing opportunities related to digital 
business, some typical key focus areas might be as follows:
yy enhancing the digital customer experience;
yy transforming the digital workplace;
yy gaining insights from analytics;
yy optimising infrastructure;
yy simplifying management.
81

MASTERING DIGITAL BUSINESS
The key focus areas can be any business-, process- or technology-related categories 
where you want to capture innovative ideas and opportunities. 
Process
It’s important to realise that ideation is just the first step. Ensure that there are owners 
taking the ideas to the next stage in terms of further exploration, screening, filtering, 
prioritisation and ultimate execution. The role of a facilitator running an Innovation 
Workshop or session should go far beyond simply facilitating the group and guiding 
them through an ideation session; it should also include responsibility for working with 
the appropriate stakeholders and individuals after the event to ensure that the ideas 
identified and prioritised at the session can be used to drive strategic outcomes for the 
business (see Figure 6.1). 
Figure 6.1  The strategic role of Innovation Workshop facilitators
Figure 6
.1
If your particular facilitator’s scope is narrower, or if you’re working with external facili­
tators, then ensure the appropriate hand-offs take place and there’s a suitable owner 
post-session who’s on point to carry the most promising ideas forward.
Technology
While it’s always in vogue for some to downplay the role of technology, the fact is 
that emerging technologies are providing a foundational platform for next-generation 
business models, processes, products and services. We saw this back in 2015 when 
perhaps for the first time ever, according to the 18th PwC CEO Survey,2 the top transfor­
mation trends from CEOs all related directly back to IT. 
82

IDENTIFYING AND PRIORITISING OPPORTUNITIES WITH INNOVATION WORKSHOPS
As we discussed in Chapter 5, the innovation programme itself should be digitally trans­
formed as well. For example, think about how the SMAC stack can enable stronger 
social collaboration, mobile access, improved analytics and cost-effective and agile 
cloud delivery. Think about how innovation processes can be re-designed to be more 
customer facing and produce results within faster cycle times. 
Continual improvement
Build in a continual improvement process and capture best practices learned as a 
result of your innovation events and processes. Best practices can span the gamut 
from pre-workshop planning, to the actual conduct of the workshop, to post-workshop 
deliverables and follow-on. After running many sessions, you’ll find you know exactly 
how long various forms of ideation sessions may take and even how many ideas you 
expect to collect based on the structure of the session and the number of attendees. 
While the goal is typically the quality of ideas and not the quantity, having an estimate of 
the number of ideas anticipated can still be highly beneficial since it will inform you of 
how long you may need to allocate to any subsequent steps such as voting. For continual 
improvement, it’s also important to measure, but to measure the right elements and not 
everything imaginable around your ideation processes. Measure only what will be useful 
to understand and act upon in the future.
Finally, you may remember the movie, Groundhog Day, where Bill Murray wakes up day 
after day to the same day on 2 February until he changes his behaviour. To avoid your 
own ‘innovation groundhog day’, training and education should be a continual, available 
capability so that as roles change and new hires come into your organisation, they can 
quickly get up to speed and understand the corporate innovation vocabulary and the 
range of options available to them in support of their innovation objectives. 
By implementing a multi-modal ideation approach, with both event-based and ongo­
ing ideation vehicles, your organisation will be well poised to maximise the innovation 
potential across your diverse ecosystem of employees, customers, suppliers and part­
ners in a systematic manner, and equally able to mobilise ideation sessions as, where 
and when opportunities arise. 
PLANNING YOUR INNOVATION WORKSHOP
In recent years, IT has learned how to programmatically tap into creative ideas, not 
just for its own internal purposes, but for the overall benefit to the business. More and 
more, innovative ideas are a key way for companies to seek competitive advantage in a 
market where a steady pipeline of ideas, the ability to execute, and a ‘fail fast and move 
on’ approach is the business necessity. 
When it comes to enterprise software to help manage innovation processes, there’s cer­
tainly no shortage of options on the market, from idea management and crowdsourcing 
platforms, to innovation process management software, to open innovation software, to 
innovation marketplaces. 
83

MASTERING DIGITAL BUSINESS
These platforms are mostly focused on enterprise-wide initiatives and are intended to 
operate as part of an ongoing, programmatic effort within the organisation. Of course 
many of them can be, and often are, applied for event-based or time-based sessions 
such as workshops and innovation challenges of one form or another, or even for sourc­
ing highly targeted innovation needs, but their typical purpose is to support the ongoing 
execution of an enterprise innovation programme. 
One area I find that complements this ongoing, enterprise-wide approach very nicely is 
the conduct of one- or two-day targeted innovation workshops using web-based group 
decision support software (GDSS). The meetings are typically conducted primarily in 
person with a group of 10 to 25 individuals. We use the GDSS to rapidly collect a set of 
ideas and innovation opportunities from the group that are discussed and prioritised 
during the meeting. Topics typically range from exploring innovative ideas in macro-
level areas, such as applications and data centres, all the way to specific disruptive 
trends such as cloud, mobile, social and big data. 
The focus of the workshops can be business-, process- and technology-oriented, as 
opposed to just one particular slant, and we take the approach that all ideas don’t 
necessarily have to be strategic or transformational in nature. Even tactical or incre­
mental ideas, as long as they can lend measurable business value, are considered to 
be in scope and of benefit. 
IN-DEPTH: INNOVATION WORKSHOP APPROACH
Innovation workshops are internal and customer-facing workshops that focus on inno­
vation opportunity identification, categorisation, prioritisation and then the development 
of high-level business cases and implementation roadmaps for the most promising 
opportunities identified.
Key process steps
yy Opportunity identification – Identify innovation opportunities for a specific 
business pain point or opportunity. Participants bring a laptop or tablet and 
enter their ideas into a web-based group decision support software (GDSS) 
tool, which provides electronic capture of ideas for discussion and voting.
yy Opportunity categorisation – Discuss the identified opportunities by 
reviewing the electronic whiteboard of ideas and hearing the elevator 
pitches related to each idea. Categorise ideas by key focus area and remove 
duplicates.
yy Opportunity prioritisation – Further classify the innovation opportunities 
by way of individual voting so that we gain a sense of their financial value, 
strategic fit, time/cost to implement/maintain, and project risk/complexity.
yy Opportunity profiling – Complete high-level opportunity profiles for each 
innovation opportunity to better understand their business value (including 
84

IDENTIFYING AND PRIORITISING OPPORTUNITIES WITH INNOVATION WORKSHOPS
	 more quantitative assessment of ROI impact and overall benefits) and 
suitable timing in terms of implementation. 
yy Opportunity roadmapping – Determine how these innovations can be more 
effectively built into a future state architecture and roadmap for subsequent 
implementation. 
Figure 6.2  Innovation Workshop process flow
Figure 6.2
85

MASTERING DIGITAL BUSINESS
In conducting these sessions, here are ten best practices that I’ve found help to ensure 
quality outcomes when using this type of GDSS specifically for an Innovation Workshop: 
1.	
Agree on goals and objectives upfront with stakeholders – Well ahead of the 
workshop, discuss the overall goals and objectives with your stakeholders 
and also prepare a list of key focus areas or topic areas for your workshop. 
These key focus areas help to define specifically what topics you wish to 
brainstorm around with your audience. 
2.	
Drive the selection of attendees based upon key focus areas – The key 
focus areas should be used to determine the appropriate SMEs to invite to 
the session. Since the focus is a collaborative brainstorming session, as 
opposed to one-way presentations, it’s useful to keep the total number of 
attendees to between 10 and 25. 
3.	
Present innovation challenges and opportunities to set the context – Have your 
stakeholder present a short overview of the business needs related to innovation 
and the kinds of ideas he or she is looking for out of the session. This will help set 
the background context for the SMEs at the session. 
4.	
Prepare a well-defined agenda and participant guide – The agenda should 
clearly mark out sections for opportunity identification (brainstorming), 
opportunity categorisation (hearing the elevator pitches for each idea and 
combining related ideas) and opportunity prioritisation (voting). For example, 
if you’re using online software to capture ideas from the group, I’ve found that 
30 minutes is an ideal amount of time for individuals to submit ideas into the 
system using their laptops and tablets. 
5.	
Allow participants to build upon each other’s ideas – Once attendees have 
entered their ideas into the software, it’s useful to have them review the ideas 
from others and add comments as appropriate. This helps them to build upon 
each other’s ideas and can help to strengthen the overall value proposition 
around the ideas or help to raise additional questions for consideration. 
6.	
Hear the elevator pitches for each idea – Since ideas are submitted by 
everyone simultaneously, it’s important to go down the electronic whiteboard 
of ideas row by row and hear the elevator pitches from the people who 
submitted them. This gives the full audience an overview of the ideas before 
moving to the voting stage. 
7.	
Use a well-defined set of voting criteria – A well-defined set of criteria can 
help to ensure that voting results can be used to properly evaluate ideas 
based upon business benefit and ease of implementation. A best practice 
is to have an equal number of criteria for each of these two vectors so that 
innovation ideas and opportunities can be plotted on a cost/benefit matrix 
or similar analysis tool such as a project prioritisation matrix. 
8.	
Define how you will measure success – To measure the success of the 
workshops, you’ll typically want to track three key areas: the quality of the 
workshop session, the quality of the facilitators themselves and the business 
outcomes achieved as a result of the session. This can be achieved by 
attendee satisfaction surveys at the conclusion of the workshop and also 
by rigorous follow-up to monitor the success of ideas designated for further 
analysis and eventual implementation. 
86

IDENTIFYING AND PRIORITISING OPPORTUNITIES WITH INNOVATION WORKSHOPS
9.	
Make the facilitation role strategic – The facilitation role for innovation 
workshops is much more than just facilitating an audience: it entails 
managing the pre-workshop planning, the actual conduct of the workshop, 
and then the necessary follow-up actions to ensure that the desired business 
outcomes are realised as a result of the session. 
10.	 Maintain consistency and quality through frequent training – If you put in 
place a programmatic approach to these kinds of innovation workshops, it’s 
important to provide regular training for your facilitators and to select the 
right number of facilitators to cover your anticipated needs across business 
units and geographies. There’s a delicate balance that needs to be maintained 
between having enough facilitators for coverage and a small enough group 
for quality purposes so that they can build their experience. 
Of course, some of these guidelines will vary based on exactly how you define and imple­
ment your innovation workshops. What I’ve found over the years is that there’s a number 
of ways to ‘skin the cat’ and no ‘right’ or ‘wrong’ approaches. Each approach has its own 
strengths and weaknesses and it’s important to learn from each variation to the workshop 
approach and go with what fits best in your particular case. There’s a tremendous number 
of variables you can adjust in an Innovation Workshop, from number of focus areas, to 
number of attendees, to the structure and timing of each step in the process, to the types 
of voting criteria and whether or not to vote individually or as a group. The key thing to 
bear in mind is that sometimes simplicity and consistency is the most effective approach. 
KEEPING IT LEAN
As we have seen, innovation workshops are a valuable technique for event-based 
ideation, which can complement ongoing enterprise ideation processes. As with any 
enterprise initiative or capability with the word ‘innovation’ in its title, innovation 
workshops are also subject to the usual – and appropriate – scrutiny, evaluation and 
questions from various parts of the organisation, from senior leadership to managers 
and employees. 
Commonly asked questions may revolve around the efficiency and effectiveness of the 
workshop in terms of any of the following aspects:
yy methodology;
yy duration;
yy cost;
yy resources;
yy objectives;
yy outcomes.
The questions are often inspired by the latest management approach such as ‘lean’, as 
well as (for obvious business purposes) to ensure and confirm a healthy ROI. Executives 
and employees may need reassurance that the workshop is not too ‘heavyweight’ 
in terms of being too process-heavy, too lengthy in duration, too costly in terms of 
87

MASTERING DIGITAL BUSINESS
employee time commitments and travel costs, or too inefficient in getting to its overall 
objectives and target outcomes. 
As a digital business leader or manager, if you’re coordinating any aspect of innovation 
for your organisation, particularly innovation workshops or other initiatives in support 
of targeted ideation, here are three steps to ensure that your activities pass – and even 
exceed – the litmus test in terms of ‘lean’ principles.
Lean processes 
The first area to review is that of the process behind your Innovation Workshop. The 
process needs to be lightweight, flexible and tailorable to get to the required results 
quickly, but with the appropriate level of rigour, consistency and quality throughout. 
The workshop process should go beyond just getting to a laundry list of ideas, and ideally 
should take these ideas from identification, to categorisation, to prioritisation (that is, voting) 
and finally, for the most promising ideas, to high-level business cases and an actionable 
roadmap. What happens ‘after the workshop’ should be equally agile and well defined. 
It’s important to look at the efficiency of every step of the workshop process from idea­
tion to voting and optimise accordingly. For example, within the ideation process itself, 
we’ve found that we can collect electronically submitted ideas from a group in as little 
as 30 minutes, provided they have the right background context and guidance upfront 
to focus their efforts. 
As another example, voting on ideas requires the right number of voting criteria that 
will provide sufficient data for interpretation and analysis, but without tying up too much 
time on the part of the participants. We’ve found that four voting criteria, with two as 
a measure of ‘business impact’ and two as a measure of ‘ease of implementation’, is a 
manageable number for voting purposes that can still provide sufficient insight for a 
project prioritisation matrix. 
It’s also useful to design and offer several versions of the workshop, ranging from a 
half-day to a one-day and two-day format, based on the number of process steps con­
ducted and the size of your audience (see Table 6.1). We typically take ideation all the 
way through to voting via half-day and one-day sessions, based on audience size, and 
then progress to the development of high-level business cases and implementation 
roadmaps on the second day of our two-day sessions.

The process should also support physical, virtual or hybrid sessions (that is, both physi­
cal and virtual attendees), based on the intended audience and the objectives of the 
workshop. As an example, you may wish to perform in-person workshops with clients 
where face time is paramount, but rely more on virtual or hybrid sessions for internal 
purposes. 
Lean resources
In terms of resources, you want to ensure that you’re bringing the right people to your 
session and have a robust programme in place in terms of how you train and deploy 
your Innovation Workshop facilitators. 
For choosing the right attendees, a best practice is to use the key focus areas of the 
workshop as a way to drive the SME selection. This will ensure that you have the right 
people at the table – either physically or virtually – to cover the key topics for the session. 
As an example, in running workshops for clients, I typically work with the client sponsor 
ahead of time to agree on the goals and objectives for the workshop, and to precisely 
define the key focus areas for the brainstorming. The key focus areas are typically six to 
eight major topic areas, where the client wishes to explore innovative ideas, and are used 
to determine the SME selection on both the client side and from my own organisation. 
89

MASTERING DIGITAL BUSINESS
For facilitation, we draw from a global pool of trained facilitators. The goal is to have 
sufficient geographic and language coverage worldwide, but a small enough team so 
that the facilitators are running many sessions per year and can build their expertise. 
This helps to ensure quality and consistency in the workshops. You might think of it 
as a ‘minimum viable footprint’ approach in terms of enough facilitators for the global 
footprint, yet a small-enough, focused-enough team for quality and consistency. 
Finally, if you have key physical locations where you know you’ll be running multiple 
innovation workshops per year, having facilitators trained up locally can be another 
valuable approach to conserve travel costs. 
Lean technology
In terms of lean technology, a cloud-based GDSS can be a powerful tool for captur­
ing ideas, discussing and reviewing the ideas with the group (that is, hearing the 
elevator pitches), and then voting on the ideas based on business benefit and ease of 
implementation. 
In comparing web-based workshops with traditional, manual workshop techniques, I’ve 
seen a twofold to fourfold increase in the number of ideas that can be generated and a 
far more efficient voting process. 
In a typical Innovation Workshop, using a GDSS, we can capture 50 to 100 ideas from a 
group of 10 to 25 attendees and arrive at a prioritised set of the most promising ideas 
within two to six hours, based on audience size. In contrast, a ‘traditional’ innovation 
workshop using sticky notes, or similar, may generate half the number of ideas within 
the same time frame, and without any prioritisation of the ideas. 
Table 6.2 shows some typical time requirements for the various steps in a fast-paced, 
two-day Innovation Workshop from idea capture, to elevator pitches, to voting, to devel­
opment of mini-business cases and an overall implementation roadmap.

Perhaps more importantly, the GDSS enables the entire set of participants to contrib­
ute ideas on an equal footing (that is, all have access to enter ideas electronically) as 
opposed to the manual, paper-based or whiteboard approach, which tends to favour the 
most vocal few in the room. This can be one of the unsung, yet important, value-added 
benefits of an Innovation Workshop, since it enables you to convene a cross-functional 
or cross-business unit team who may not collaborate on a regular basis. It enables 
cross-pollination of ideas and can help drive consensus. 
While these are some specific recommendations related to innovation workshops, it’s 
also important to apply the same thinking across your entire innovation management 
capability – of which we have seen there are typically five critical pillars. 
Today’s innovation programmes need to be highly adapted and fine-tuned to support 
digital transformation initiatives and should therefore embrace the same operating 
principles – that is, lean, agile, flexible, efficient and more – so they can be executed at 
speed and at scale.

MASTERING DIGITAL BUSINESS
KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR CHAPTER 6
yy While ideation is a small part of an enterprise innovation programme, 
there’s many things to consider in terms of targeting your ideation activities 
to support both the tactical and strategic needs of the business as it relates 
to digital transformation. 
yy In terms of ideation tools and approaches, there’s no shortage of  
options to choose from. The key consideration is that you’ll likely need a 
combination of both event-based ideation, as well as ongoing, enterprise-
wide ideation processes as part of your overall innovation strategy.
yy By implementing a multi-modal ideation approach, with both event- 
based and ongoing ideation vehicles, your organisation will be well poised 
to maximise the innovation potential across your diverse ecosystem of 
employees, customers, suppliers and partners in a systematic manner and 
equally able to mobilise ideation sessions as, where and when opportunities 
arise. 
yy Innovation workshops focus on innovation opportunity identification, 
categorisation, prioritisation and then the development of high-level 
business cases and implementation roadmaps for the most promising 
opportunities identified.
yy There’s a tremendous number of variables you can adjust in an Innovation 
Workshop: from number of focus areas, to number of attendees, to the 
structure and timing of each step in the process, to the types of voting 
criteria and whether or not to vote individually or as a group. The key thing 
to bear in mind is that sometimes simplicity and consistency are the most 
effective approaches. 
yy As a digital business leader or manager, if you’re coordinating  
any aspect of innovation for your organisation, particularly innovation 
workshops or other initiatives in support of targeted ideation, there are 
three steps to ensure your activities pass – and even exceed – the litmus 
test in terms of ‘lean’ principles: lean processes, resources and technology.

TIMING YOUR MOVE BASED ON 
TECHNOLOGY MATURITY
You win battles by knowing the enemy’s timing, and using a timing which the enemy 
does not expect.

Miyamoto Musashi1
With a knowledge of the technology adoption lifecycle, we can overlay our own model 
on top of this in terms of what kinds of business value we can expect to extract over 
time. As emerging technologies are adopted into the enterprise at various stages of 
their maturity by pioneers, early adopters, and the early and late majority, there are 
generally three windows of opportunity, or ‘waves’, where these technologies can be 
exploited. By understanding the nature and characteristics of each wave, and the wave 
that each technology trend is in at any point in time, leaders and organisations can best 
exploit their position for business model transformation (emerging wave), high competi­
tive advantage (differentiating wave) or proven business value (business value wave).
TIMING YOUR MOVE INTO DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGIES
The IoT. Big data analytics. Intelligent automation. With so many disruptive technologies 
on the horizon, timing your move into each can make the difference between getting 
ahead of the competition and falling irreparably behind.
One thing that can help you gauge when to take up an emerging technology is the tech­
nology adoption life cycle.2 This sociological model, invented by researchers at the 
University of Iowa who were studying the adoption of hybrid seed corn by farmers, 
illustrates that adoption typically follows a bell curve, with the first adopters being the 
innovators, followed by the early adopters, the early majority, the late majority and 
finally the laggards (Figure 7.1).
It can certainly be argued that, over the course of the 20th century, technologies were 
adopted at a faster and faster pace. For example, the telephone took 25 years to reach 
10 per cent penetration3 of US households, and another 39 years to reach 40 per cent. 
Midcentury, colour television took 18 years4 (between 1954 and 1972) to reach 50 per 
cent adoption by US households. More recently, the smartphone needed just ten years 
to reach 40 per cent adoption by US consumers, and the tablet has reached 10 per cent 
penetration in less than three years.

Of course, a lot of factors come into play. Landline telephones and electricity took many 
years to be adopted by a majority of the population, but they both faced ‘last mile’ dif­
ficulties in bringing telephone lines and electric cables to homes. With colour televi­
sion, price was a factor, as was the availability of colour programming. Nonetheless, as 
shown in Figure 7.2, the evidence points to ever-faster adoption rates, which can leave 
you thinking that there’s a very short window for competitive advantage around each 
disruptive trend.

TIMING YOUR MOVE BASED ON TECHNOLOGY MATURITY
The good news is that, while product cycle times may be well under a year, the overall 
trend upon which the technologies are carried typically unfolds over many years. Within 
each trend there are multiple enabling technologies, all at various stages of maturity and 
adoption. Take cloud computing as an example. If we categorise cloud computing into soft­
ware as-a-service (SaaS), platform as-a-service (PaaS) and infrastructure as-a-service 
(IaaS), it’s clear that each area has its own unique trajectory and timeline. The SaaS move­
ment has been under way since the late 1990s and is more mature than PaaS or IaaS. 
Even within the SaaS market, certain approaches and business functions are more mature 
and widely accepted than others. For example, cloud-based email and collaboration are 
far more widespread than current use of IT service management as-a-service.
In addition, many of the most enduring trends take many years to unfold. Mobility is 
a great example. While it’s been around for several decades, it’s only in recent years 
that we have the combination of low-cost, feature-rich devices, ubiquitous access, and 
easy-to-use applications and interfaces that has enabled mobility to quickly become 
the new desktop.
With all this in mind, timing your move into an emerging area is a lot more complex 
than a simple go/no-go decision. Whether it’s the IoT, big data analytics or intelligent 
automation, here are three recommendations to help with timing your move:
1. Watch the early adopters
Even if they are in other industries, you can learn from the experiences of early adopters. 
If you’re a fast follower as opposed to a lead innovator, you’ll be able to study the experi­
ences and case studies of companies and competitors in your industry in order to time 
your move. If you’re a lead innovator, you may need to monitor other industries that may 
be faster adopters of emerging technology than your industry and see how their experi­
ences might translate to opportunities within your own.
2. Determine a suite of strategic levers tailored to your corporate objectives
Develop a long list of ways you can apply the various technologies to benefit the business 
and detail what benefit will accrue to which set of stakeholders. It is likely that the levers 
can be applied toward either IT or line-of-business objectives and for any combination 
of cost reduction, process improvement, customer satisfaction or revenue generation 
purposes, depending upon the target business process and constituency. This suite of 
strategic levers will provide you with a slate of options that you can then apply over 
time, based upon the maturity of the underlying technologies and end-user readiness.
3. Develop a strategic roadmap for each disruptive trend
For each area like the IoT, big data analytics or intelligent automation, it’s important 
to have a strategic roadmap over a suitable planning horizon, such as the next three 
years, which details how you plan to progressively exploit the technology for business 
advantage. These trend-specific strategic roadmaps should be a key part of your IT 
strategy, much the same way as the UK Government has taken a Digital by default5 
approach for all new digital services from the government, or the way in which the 
US federal government incorporated mobility into their Digital government strategy6 
and required agencies to mobile-enable at least two priority customer-facing services 
95

MASTERING DIGITAL BUSINESS
within a 12-month timeframe. The suite of strategic levers may give you a good starting 
point from which to map out your various initiatives within the roadmap.
Finally, it’s important to know your company’s overall stance and appetite for risk with 
regard to technology adoption and ensure that your plans are appropriately aligned. 
Even in a more conservative organisation, it may well be permissible and beneficial to 
break the mould if the stakes are not too high or if you’re operating in a carefully con­
trolled environment. In all situations, look for innovative uses of the technology above 
and beyond what others are doing. Many of the strongest business returns on emerging 
technologies often materialise when they’re applied in novel ways to enable new busi­
ness models and new business processes.
THE THREE WAVES OF DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION
It’s critical to maximising the business value of disruptive trends – such as the IoT, big 
data analytics and intelligent automation – that we understand their adoption lifecycles 
and leverage them appropriately at each stage. Having learned earlier in this chapter 
about the technology adoption lifecycle, we can now overlay our own model on top of 
this in terms of what kinds of business value we can expect to extract over time. 
A particular technology trend in pioneer or early adopter status needs to be handled 
quite differently from when it’s progressed into the early majority, or even the late 
majority. The kinds of benefits you can expect to obtain are quite different as well. Of 
course, we all know about the window of opportunity for competitive differentiation 
while the trend is in early stages of enterprise adoption, but let’s explore this topic a bit 
further to see what other insights might be revealed. 
An analogy I like to draw is surfing. I believe that there’s three waves you can catch 
around the same technology trend: the emerging wave, the differentiating wave and the 
business value wave as shown in Table 7.1. That is, not only riding the wave around each 
disruptive trend, but riding the same wave of a particular trend multiple times during 
its journey to the shoreline. These three waves follow the adoption of the technology as 
it progresses from pioneers to mainstream adoption.

Understanding the wave that each trend is in at any point in time will help you to best 
exploit its position for business model transformation (emerging wave), high competi­
tive advantage (differentiating wave) or proven business value (business value wave). 
Let’s look at each wave and examine some of its characteristics. 
The emerging wave
The emerging wave relates to disruptive technologies and trends that are in the pioneer 
and early adopter stages. Trends such as the IoT, intelligent automation, wearable 
devices and AR, blockchain technology, SDNs and fabric computing are good examples 
for this wave since they’re in the early stages of enterprise adoption. Because they’re 
still emerging, there’s tremendous potential for organisations to use them in unique 
ways to create new business models, deliver new digital products and services, and 
even explore and instill transformational changes within their industries. 
At this stage, business models can be transformational, competitive advantage can be 
high in the specific areas of implementation, and the long-term ROI of an initiative or 
venture, if it’s successful, can be outstanding. Outside the pioneers, however, the busi­
ness value of the technology itself is often not clearly understood by the masses and 
there are limited examples of how it can be utilised for others to follow. 
97

MASTERING DIGITAL BUSINESS
The differentiating wave
The differentiating wave relates to disruptive technologies and trends that are in 
the early adopter stages. Trends such as big data analytics and social business are 
currently in this wave, since they’re still in relatively early adoption when you look at 
how the technologies are being utilised across the typical enterprise. There’s still plenty 
of time for organisations to achieve competitive advantage and differentiation through 
these technologies by exploring untapped business scenarios and use cases that others 
have yet to either discover or exploit. 
As an example, McKinsey’s value levers for social business illustrate the many options 
available both within and across organisational functions.7 Examples include leverag­
ing social to ‘forecast and monitor’ operations and distribution functions, or leveraging 
social to ‘co-create products’ via open innovation with customers. While several social 
business value levers such as digital marketing and employee collaboration are in use 
by many, if not most, organisations there’s still a number of value levers that are rela­
tively untapped. In this wave, there are also several commonly known ROI examples for 
fast followers to pursue. 
The business value wave
The business value wave relates to disruptive technologies and trends that are in the 
early and late majority stages. Trends such as cloud and mobile computing are clearly 
in this wave today, since the typical business models and scenarios for implementation 
are well defined, and the typical business value and ROI is well known and recognised. 
Examples include the use of SaaS for cost reduction and agility, or the use of mobile 
applications for sales force and field force productivity. 
That’s not to say that technologies in this wave can’t be used for transformational busi­
ness models or differentiation, but due to the maturity of the technology and its stage 
of adoption in the enterprise, this is typically less common or applies to new technical 
innovations within each megatrend. The technologies here are generally mature, well 
understood and are delivering value on a day-to-day basis. In essence, they’ve become 
part of the engine room for IT. 
Key takeaways
So what are the key takeaways from this view on the disruptive trends? Think about how 
you could ride a wave around something like big data analytics or the IoT, not just for a 
new business model, such as carving out a role in an industry-specific data value chain 
(for example, device manufacturer, data provider, analytics provider, analytics integrator, 
etc.), but how you might ride other waves around this trend as it matures. How could 
you differentiate your products and services via insights from big data analytics, and 
how could you realise ongoing business value as it becomes part of business as usual? 
One of the answers here lies in collaboration across the C-suite so that the business 
benefits of disruptive technologies are not only maximised across their lifecycle as they 
mature and evolve over time, but also across the enterprise in terms of putting IT to 
work as an enabler and amplifier of business performance.

STRATEGIES FOR SPECIFIC TARGET 
BUSINESS OUTCOMES

ENHANCING THE DIGITAL CUSTOMER 
EXPERIENCE
We see our customers as invited guests to a party, and we are the hosts. It’s our 
job every day to make every important aspect of the customer experience a little 
bit better.

Jeff Bezos1
In Part I of this book, we saw how leading organisations are delivering compelling digital 
customer experiences via re-designed business models and processes, via combina­
tions of foundational technologies, as well as by exploiting the power of platform and 
ecosystem-oriented business models. Each of these areas can be considered a strategic 
lever for creating or enhancing the digital customer experience by taking an outside-in 
approach to create compelling new customer journeys and value propositions. 
In this chapter, we’ll examine these strategic levers in more detail and take an in-depth 
look in terms of what the ideal digital customer experience may look like – in the form of 
a Digital Customer Experience (DCX) Bill of Rights. We’ll also take a look at how combina­
tions of foundational technologies can be used to provide a compelling next-generation 
experience in terms of ‘digital experience essentials’ and ‘digital experience enhancers’ 
at every step of the customer journey with your brand, product or service.
STRATEGIC LEVERS FOR THE DIGITAL CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE
Although it’s not about the technology, as we’ve seen earlier, each foundational 
technology element can play a key part in contributing towards the overall, integrated 
experience from the customer’s perspective looking from the outside in. While SMAC 
capabilities are now expected by default in leading consumer applications, the new 
competitive battleground is being fought with new weaponry that taps further into the 
power of personas and context, the IoT, wearables and AR, and intelligent automation. 
These capabilities can not only be applied to enhance and differentiate the digital 
customer experience, but they can also be used to help organisations better understand 
and manage their customers’ digital journeys (Figure 8.1). 
We’ll now look at each of these strategic levers in more detail, beginning with the busi­
ness model lever.
103

MASTERING DIGITAL BUSINESS
Figure 8.1  Strategic levers for the digital customer experience
Figure 8.1
Business model lever
In Chapter 1, when we examined Porter’s Five Forces Model of industry competition, we 
found that perhaps the strongest of the five forces is the bargaining power of buyers 
(that is, customers), since the biggest driver of digital business comes from the needs 
and expectations of consumers and customers themselves. This bargaining power lays 
out a new set of expectations for the digital customer experience and necessitates 
continual corporate and organisational innovation across business models, processes, 
operations, products and services. 
Customers and consumers have amassed far more bargaining power today due to 
instant access to information, insights from social media (including access to reviews 
and feedback), low switching costs via digital channels, price sensitivity, access to sub­
stitute products and services with greater ease of use and convenience, as well as 
increased industry competitiveness as a result of the other forces. 
If you’re operating at this level, you’re likely constructing a completely new product or 
service for customers and crafting the digital customer experience and overall cus­
tomer journey from the ground up. At this top level, you’ll be addressing fundamental 
questions in regard to your business model and value proposition for customers as 
follows:
yy What’s the scope, value proposition and differentiation of your overall 
solution? This should include a description of the scope of the solution – that is, 
exactly what is being offered, the specific use cases for your target customers, 
and how the product or service fits into, or replaces, their current way of doing 
business. Clearly articulating the scope of the solution, including the starting 
and ending points in the customer journey, will help you to determine if you’re 
attacking the right problem space, in terms of both market and customer 
appetite and your own ability to execute, or if you need to narrow your original 
vision to avoid trying to boil the ocean.
yy What’s the detailed functionality of your product or service? This should 
include a description of the key features and functionality, the enabling and 
disruptive technologies employed, and the overall technical architecture and 
104

ENHANCING THE DIGITAL CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE
	 deployment model, as well as the core intellectual property (IP) being employed 
and your envisioned product roadmap. In addition to your overall business 
model and partnering strategy, unique IP is key in terms of barriers to entry, 
since it may help to stave off the competition and other new entrants for at least 
a time sufficient for you to gain an edge.
yy What’s the market you intend to serve, and what is its size and growth rate? 
This should include answering the key question of why now is a good time 
for your specific solution, given the evolution of the market and recent market 
trends and developments – including changes to customer and buyer profiles, 
needs, expectations and behaviours. In addition, address what will compel 
customers to want to adopt and utilise your specific solution, instead of what’s 
out there already, and what some of the envisioned drivers and barriers are to 
gaining this adoption.
yy Who is your target audience and what are your customer segments? This 
should include a profile of your customers and buyers, their needs and, for 
business-to-business (B2B) scenarios, a list of initial prospects. If you have 
feedback from initial customer discussions, proofs of concept and pilots, this 
should be shared here as well to help validate customer demand and interest 
levels. 
Answers to these questions, along with answers to other questions related to your 
business model, competition, partners, team and financials, can help to ensure that 
you’ve thought the plan through for your own purposes and that you will be best 
equipped to address stakeholder or investor scrutiny.
Doing your homework here will get you to a point where you can have an intelligent 
discussion, not only about the benefits of the platform or application you’re envisioning, 
but also about the envisioned customer journey and how you believe you can realisti­
cally take the concept from idea to execution. 
Business process lever
In Chapter 2, we learned that one of the key characteristics of a digital business 
process is that it’s ‘experience-centric’, whereby the digital customer experience 
drives everything, powered by rich combinations of technology enablers. We learned 
that experience-centric digital processes, by their very nature, tap into powerful 
combinations of emerging and disruptive technologies as their foundational building 
blocks. We saw this earlier in our Streetline example, which taps into data from IoT 
sensors, relayed to the cloud, to publish real-time parking data via a mobile app so 
drivers can find open parking spots. 
When we looked at the key attributes of a digital business process, compared to tradi­
tional business processes, we found that they were experience-centric, automated, sim­
plified, digitised, personalised, dynamic, real time, granular, aggregated and scalable. 
Each of these attributes contributes in their own way towards the overall digital cus­
tomer experience by helping to craft the overall customer journey from start to finish.
The net result is that, when applying this business process lever towards the digital 
customer experience, some of the resulting attributes translate to value, engagement, 
105

MASTERING DIGITAL BUSINESS
simplicity, timeliness, and an elegant and enjoyable experience. As an example, when 
processes are simplified down to their most intuitive, minimal steps, the outcome is 
a simple and timely digital customer experience. When processes have multiple ver­
sions and infinite configurations down to the individual customer, product or service, the 
result is that customers have a sense that they are well known and understood. When 
dynamic processes are created, deployed and executed on the fly, the net result is intel­
ligent, anticipatory services. These are all examples of how business process re-design 
can be applied to craft compelling customer journeys that drive increased brand loyalty, 
customer satisfaction and revenues.
Technology lever
In Chapter 3, we saw how part of the secret to mastering digital business, and a key 
ingredient in some of the most successful business process re-design efforts using the 
‘digital medium’, is utilising combinations of enabling technologies to create the most 
compelling digital customer experience possible. We saw how organisations can select 
powerful combinations of technologies to achieve target business outcomes ranging 
from enhancing the digital customer experience, to transforming the digital workplace, 
to optimising infrastructure and simplifying management.
When we think about applying the technology lever towards the digital customer experi­
ence, we can group these technologies into those that deliver ‘digital experience essen­
tials’ and those that can be considered ‘digital experience enhancers’, which go above 
and beyond the essentials. 
Digital experience essentials 
In Chapter 4, we saw how social, mobile, analytic and cloud technologies, together with 
personas and context, and robust cyber security, were being used to improve the digital 
customer experience and create entirely new customer journeys. As an example, we 
saw how the Snapshot application from Progressive Insurance combines technology 
elements of a mobile device, extensive data analytics, a cloud-based application and 
‘badges’ for good driving, which can be shared via the driver’s social networks. We 
also saw how the driver’s ‘context’ clearly comes into play, with the entire application 
focused on actual driving behaviour as monitored in real time by the Snapshot device.
We can think of these technologies as ‘digital experience essentials’ because they cater 
to basic customer needs and expectations such as the right to share, to be heard, and to 
be informed (social); the right to internet access anytime, anywhere (mobile); the right 
to information and recommendations (analytics); the right to simplicity and timeliness 
(cloud); the right to be known and understood (personas and context); and the right to 
safety and security (cyber security).
These are all critical elements where their presence, or absence, can make the differ­
ence between the services of digital leaders and digital laggards. Increasingly, having 
an in-depth knowledge and understanding about the customers’ preferences, needs, 
interests and behaviours is becoming a defining characteristic of digital leaders. This 
information can be used to personalise the customer’s digital journey at every stage 
along the way and to create a highly loyal customer base, where customers feel that 
106

ENHANCING THE DIGITAL CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE
they are intimately well known and their needs and expectations are well understood 
throughout every interaction and transaction. Examples of these highly personalised 
and curated experiences include Amazon’s recommendation engine, Netflix’s movie 
recommendations and many others.
Organisations that do this well have earned their customers trust by creating a win–win 
value proposition in terms of data sharing. Customers are willing to share their data, 
including their preferences, needs, interests and behaviours because they trust the 
company to use the information to deliver enhanced and highly personalised services 
and to respect their needs with regard to security and the privacy of their information. 
When we look across the digital experience essentials, data is one of the key elements 
because it’s through data that organisations can really differentiate themselves by using 
this information to build a highly trusted relationship with their customers and one 
that is personalised and curated. As you apply the various strategy levers in crafting 
experiences for your own customers, data can be one of the most powerful weapons 
available. 
Digital experience enhancers
As we look to the future, we are seeing a number of new technologies being applied 
as digital experience enhancers on top of the digital experience essentials. Examples 
include the IoT, intelligent automation technologies, as well as wearables and AR 
applications. These particular technologies are not necessarily required for a customer’s 
digital experience, but certain companies are using them to carve out innovative spaces 
in their industries and to delight their customers with remarkable new experiences 
that are unlike anything that’s come before. When we analyse these companies, we find 
that each company typically ‘majors’ in one of these digital experience enhancers and 
couples this with the full complement of digital experience essentials.
IoT enhancers
We saw an example of this in Chapter 4, with the RingTM Video Doorbell.2 Ring essentially 
‘majors’ around the IoT by using IoT devices, including its wireless video doorbell, as the 
lead technology in its customer journey, together with a mobile app, video recording in 
the cloud and social features. As per our earlier Progressive Snapshot example, we see 
the familiar combination of SMAC technologies, but with the addition of IoT devices in 
this smart home scenario. 
As another example, the Disney MagicBand is an IoT wristband that Disney visitors wear 
in order to enter the parks, unlock their Disney Resort hotel room and buy food and mer­
chandise. According to Disney, each MagicBand contains an HF Radio Frequency device 
and a transmitter, which sends and receives RF signals through a small antenna inside 
the MagicBand and enables it to be detected at short-range touch points throughout 
Walt Disney World Resort.3 It also connects to all the vacation choices and preferences 
they’ve made via their My Disney Experience website such as FastPass+ choices for 
selected attractions. While the RFID technology behind the MagicBand has been around 
for a while, what’s interesting about this particular example is the way that Disney is 
using the wristband across a wide range of usage scenarios to enhance the overall 
customer experience.

Intelligent automation enhancers
If we look at some examples in the intelligent automation space, not only are compa­
nies delivering smart services by applying intelligent analytics and algorithms, includ­
ing artificial intelligence (AI), to better understand and anticipate the customers’ likely 
needs based upon their context and historical behaviour, but they’re also pulling in 
robotics technologies directly into consumer environments.
The Aloft hotel chain in the US has been trialling robotic valets, from hospitality robotics 
company Savioke, since 2014. These robotic valets are used to autonomously deliver 
essentials to guests such as toothbrushes, snacks, extra towels and other supplies. 
This helps hotel staff focus more on serving guests around more important interac­
tions, as opposed to mundane delivery tasks.4 The robots can easily navigate the hotel 
passageways, including elevators, and deliver supplies directly from the front desk to 
the guest’s room. The hotel staff simply put the supplies into a hatch at the top of the 
3-foot-tall robot, type in the guest room number for the delivery and then send it off. 
The robot calls the elevator using a Wi-Fi connection and then calls the guest on their 
room phone when it arrives at the room. The overall customer experience is enhanced 
through both the novel interactions with the robotic valet, which can be a valuable and 
unique business differentiator, as well as through the enhanced attention of hotel staff.
As another example, the Henn-na hotel in the Huis Ten Bosch theme park in Nagasaki, 
Japan, has been aiming to become ‘the most efficient hotel in the world’ by reducing man­
power and having 90 per cent of the staff be robotic. Robotic staff at this hotel include a 
robotic concierge, robotic porters for luggage, as well as small robotic creatures in the guest 
rooms that can switch on lights, provide weather forecasts and schedule wake-up calls.5 
In these specific scenarios, both of these companies are experimenting with majoring in 
robotics via robotic staff and valets and then wrapping this experience with the comple­
ment of digital experience essentials. This innovation around intelligent automation isn’t 
confined just to hotels, and robots are increasingly interacting with patients in hospitals, 
employees in the workplace, and in a wide range of physical and virtual scenarios. We’ll 
explore this topic on intelligent automation in further detail in Chapter 9, ‘Transforming 
the digital workplace’, when we look at how it’s impacting employees, augmenting work 
processes and reshaping the future of work. 
Wearables and AR enhancers
Another set of digital experience enhancers are wearable devices such as smart 
glasses and smart watches coupled with AR applications. This enables users and appli­
cations to take advantage of the hands-free process optimisation and convenience of 
wearables, together with the instant information and intuitive visual guidance capabili­
ties of AR applications.
Wearables and AR applications are extending the computing transformation that has defined 
the last several decades, in which computing has continually moved closer and closer to the 
specific point where work gets done. PCs moved computing from the data centre to the front 
office and then to users’ desktops. The laptop, smartphone and tablet brought computing 
to our fingertips, wherever they might be. Wearables take this one step further by making 
computing devices even more lightweight, portable, unobtrusive and instantaneous. They 
open new modes of operation, from continual sensing and measurement, to navigating the 
physical environment, to facilitating instant information and collaboration.  
108

ENHANCING THE DIGITAL CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE
The simple fact that wearable devices are hands-free gives them a distinct advantage 
over smartphones and tablets and, when coupled with AR applications, opens up a 
number of interesting application scenarios across consumer scenarios as diverse as 
retail, financial services, health care, transportation and government. Here are three use 
case scenarios by way of example:
yy Understanding and navigating the physical environment.  AR applications 
found early traction on smartphones. Already, we can use such apps to find 
restaurants, subway stations, hotels, ATMs, Wi-Fi hotspots and more, and we 
can even augment our driving and take measurements of physical objects. AR 
apps that help us to find things are increasing their utility when they are 
incorporated into wearable devices such as smart glasses and smart watches. 
As an example, even a few years ago, Google Glass provided a navigation app for 
drivers with a small display projected onto a corner of their glasses showing a 
live, interactive map with turning directions and time to destination. As another 
example, the American Airlines app on the Apple Watch includes features to 
help customers find Admirals Clubs, search for shops and restaurants, zoom 
and map their route with navigation to baggage claim or their connecting gate 
at several major airports with new interactive terminal maps.6 As wearables 
move from the early adopter to the early mainstream in the next few years, 
businesses should think about how AR apps can help customers to find their 
stores, navigate their facilities, determine whether a product is in stock, check 
wait times, report product issues and more.
yy Enhancing the shopping experience.  In retail, AR technology has already 
made it possible for phones to act like barcode scanners and offer up extra 
product information, reviews and price comparisons. With wearable devices, 
AR apps can offer the same kinds of functionality but in a far more convenient 
manner, so consumers can continue to pick up and handle items while doing 
their online research hands-free. Retail-focused AR companies have already 
produced virtual dressing rooms for trying on clothing at home, and it’s likely 
that wearable glasses will simplify that and bring it to the showroom as well.
yy Facilitating instant information and collaboration.  The main consumer 
scenario with wearables and AR applications is that users will benefit from 
instant content and collaboration. Wearable devices will make it easier to 
access news and weather, get updates on flight status, send and reply to 
messages, dictate email, get on-screen translation, take photos and video clips, 
and videoconference so they can see what their collaborators are looking at. As 
we’ve seen in recent years, the main objection has been that wearable glasses 
will promote stealth photographing and videotaping, although there has also 
been concern among government agencies, such as the UK Department of 
Transportation, that wearable glasses will be a distraction when driving.7 
As you look across the various digital experience enhancers, it’s worth thinking about 
how one or more of these technologies could enhance your customer’s experience 
by simplifying tasks, reshaping traditional buying patterns, or by providing high-value 
information in real time, based on their context and location. Each of these technologies 
increases the art of the possible so you can continue to iterate and improve your cus­
tomer’s digital journey.

MASTERING DIGITAL BUSINESS
BRINGING IT ALL TOGETHER: THE DIGITAL CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE BILL OF 
RIGHTS
When we look across the strategic levers for enhancing the digital customer experience, 
we can see that some companies – Amazon, Apple, Disney and Netflix among them – 
are doing things right. A highly positive digital customer experience drives customer 
satisfaction, which in turn leads to increased revenues and ongoing customer loyalty for 
businesses. Consumers now expect and even demand the same kinds of digital experi­
ences from any company they deal with, regardless of industry. 
The unfortunate truth, however, is that many organisations are harming their custom­
ers’ digital experience – and in some cases their safety – on a regular basis. Customers 
can find themselves with limited access to personal data, discover that their connected 
vehicle can be digitally sabotaged, or experience a wide range of service quality and 
consistency issues along their digital journeys. 
What’s needed is a DCX Bill of Rights, along the lines of the UK Consumer Rights Act 
2015 and the US Consumer Bill of Rights, which spells out a set of essential rights and 
protections for consumers in terms of their dealings with product and service providers. 
Here are ten attributes of a world-class digital customer experience that might form the 
basis for a DCX Bill of Rights. 
For every digital interaction or transaction, the customer should be afforded the follow­
ing basic rights: 
1.	
The right to value and engagement. Customers should be provided a 
compelling value proposition to engage with an organisation, and be 
accompanied and guided on their entire journey with the brand, product or 
service.
2.	
The right to simplicity and timeliness. Every interaction or transaction 
should be quick, easy, efficient and actionable. The process should be as 
optimised as possible via the digital environment with minimal effort (that 
is, clicks, swipes, keystrokes) required to rapidly accomplish a desired task, 
or to obtain a timely resolution. 
3.	
The right to an elegant and enjoyable experience. All user interfaces 
and application designs should be elegant in terms of visual appeal, and 
enjoyable to use, in order to deliver a truly compelling and memorable 
customer experience. 
4.	
The right to anytime, anywhere access. The experience should be seamless 
and convenient by supporting any device, anytime, anywhere with a smooth 
transition between devices, apps and networks, between physical and digital 
channels, and between departments within your organisation. 
5.	
The right to be known and understood. The experience should be highly 
personalised and contextualised by always understanding the customers’ 
context including their preferences, needs, interests, behaviours, location, 
language and sentiment at any point in time to the level at which they wish 
to share that information with you. 
110

ENHANCING THE DIGITAL CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE
6.	 The right to intelligent, anticipatory services. All services should be 
smart by applying intelligent analytics and algorithms, including AI, to 
understand and anticipate the customer’s likely needs based upon their 
context and historical behaviour. Customers should be pro-actively 
notified if they need to take action or make a decision. 
7.	
The right to share, to be heard and to be informed. Customers should be 
able to share appropriate elements of their experience with others via social 
media, should be listened to and responded to, and should be provided with 
access to information and advice from others who can help to inform their 
decisions about the product or service. 
8.	
The right to information, analytics and recommendations. Historical and 
real-time data and information from the customer’s digital journey should 
be readily available, instantly accessible and downloadable, yet disposable 
(where permissible), based on customer preference and needs. Customers 
should be allowed to interactively analyse their data and be provided with 
recommendations to help them make informed decisions. 
9.	
The right to safety and security. All digital interactions, and operations of 
digitally connected devices including vehicles, should be safe and secure 
with privacy and security integrated into the full end-to-end process by 
design. Security should be an integral part of the process without adding 
unnecessary extra steps that detract from the customer experience. 
10.	 The right to education and consent. Information should be made readily 
available for the customer to understand more about your company, its digital 
processes, products and services – including the security of their transactions 
and the privacy of their data – to help them make educated decisions and 
purchases. In accordance with other privacy-related bills, customers should 
be able to control what information is shared with marketers and how such 
data is utilised. 
The DCX Bill of Rights is not intended to replace current consumer rights, but to build 
upon them with new, additional rights specifically for the customer experience in the 
digital age.
You can think of this as a hierarchy with a foundation of mandatory legal and regula­
tory protections, followed by consumer rights such as those in the UK Consumer Rights 
Act 2015 and the US Consumer Bill of Rights, and then the DCX Bill of Rights as an 
optional set of rights that organisations, both commercial and public sector, may wish 
to adhere to. 
These rights do more than spell out basic protections in terms of security and privacy; 
they can also help to serve as a checklist for how to create world-class digital experi­
ences for your customers. As you craft innovative new digital experiences for your own 
customers, you can use the rights as a checklist to ensure your services are delivering 
the end game in terms of taking the outside-in perspective that today’s digital consum­
ers demand. You can also see how the strategic levers such as the business process 
lever and the technology lever can be applied to help support and deliver one or more 
of these rights (Table 8.1).

Of course, the first step in mastering the digital customer experience is to master the 
physical customer experience. A great digital customer experience can be sabotaged 
if the physical customer experience is less than optimal. With all these elements in 
place, your organisation will be well positioned in placing the customer first, delivering 
a mutually rewarding experience, and competing in the age of digital disruption.
KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR CHAPTER 8
yy The three strategic levers for enhancing the digital customer experience are 
the business model lever, the business process lever and the technology 
lever. 
yy ‘Digital experience essentials’ cater to basic customer needs and 
expectations such as the right to share, to be heard and to be informed 
(social), the right to internet access anytime, anywhere (mobile), the right 
to information and recommendations (analytics), the right to simplicity and 
timeliness (cloud), the right to be known and understood (personas and 
context), and the right to safety and security (cyber security).
yy ‘Digital experience enhancers’ such as the IoT, intelligent automation 
technologies, wearables and AR applications are being used by certain 
companies to carve out innovative spaces in their industries and to delight 
their customers with remarkable new experiences that are unlike anything 
that’s come before.

TRANSFORMING THE DIGITAL 
WORKPLACE
I see robotic technology getting rid of the dangerous, the dirty, and the just plain 
boring jobs. Some people say, 'You can’t, People won’t have anything to do.' But we 
found things that were a lot easier than backbreaking labor in the sun and the fields. 
Let people rise to better things.

Rodney Brooks1
Just as we saw in the previous chapter on enhancing the digital customer experience, 
where we looked at digital experience essentials and digital experience enhancers, 
there are a number of foundational and disruptive technologies transforming the 
future workplace for employees. Key among these are mobility, wearables, AR, social 
networks, intelligent automation, sensors and robotics. In this chapter we’ll explore how 
‘instrumenting the human’ with wearables and sensors and ‘socialising the machine’ 
with more natural, human-friendly capabilities is helping to optimise the blend of 
human–machine participation and interaction within the digital workplace.
INSTRUMENTING THE HUMAN AND SOCIALISING THE MACHINE
When it comes to the digital workplace, the popular opinion, and fear, is that machines 
are encroaching upon human work activities and taking an ever larger percentage 
of this work away for good – from the dirty and dangerous, to the dull, to decisions. 
Fortunately, this doesn’t take into account the realm of possibilities created when work 
processes are re-imagined in the context of mutual human–machine collaboration. 
By instrumenting the human and socialising the machine, we can re-design business 
processes to optimise the blend of human–machine participation and interaction – and 
complete tasks far more efficiently than either could individually. Industrial robots, such 
as those seen in a variety of manufacturing settings, have been around for a long time 
but have typically been kept separate from humans and even behind cages, in some 
cases for safety reasons. Today, machines are stepping out from behind the cage, and 
humans are stepping into their worlds. 
Passing the baton between human and machine
As Julia Kirby and Thomas H. Davenport pointed out in their article ‘Beyond automation’ 
for Harvard Business Review,2 rather than a zero-sum game, robotic automation can be 
114

TRANSFORMING THE DIGITAL WORKPLACE
thought of as augmentation, where humans and machines collaborate to get work done. 
This is akin to a relay where the baton is passed between human and machine working 
toward a common goal, as opposed to a race pitting one against the other. 
Clearly, for business managers, in addition to reaping the benefits of this collaboration, 
it’s also important to have a clean hand-off of the baton every time to optimise the pro­
cess even further.
Since humans are driving the innovation around automation and robotics, we’re con­
sciously (and perhaps unconsciously) carving out our future roles in the workplace side 
by side with machines. Rather than harsh boundaries between humans and machines, 
we’re creating a converged future where work processes are being optimised in 
two converging directions: instrumentation of human processes and socialisation of 
machine processes, so the two can work in greater harmony together. 
Mapping the division of labour: human–machine collaboration
If we analyse this collaboration, we can see several distinct classes of work activ­
ity where either machines augment human processes, humans augment machine 
processes, or both (see Figure 9.1). 
To illustrate the types of collaboration that can occur, it’s useful to think of who performs 
the work in terms of human or machine, and whether the work is delivered physically 
or virtually. The set of human–machine scenarios includes the following:
yy ‘Physical–physical’ – meaning both humans and machines play a physical role 
such as caregivers working with smart mobile robots to deliver medicines and 
supplies in hospitals. 
yy ‘Physical–virtual’ – meaning humans play a physical role and machines 
play a virtual role at the point where work is performed, such as warehouse 
employees using smart glasses for navigation and picking instructions to boost 
productivity. 
yy ‘Virtual–physical’ – meaning humans play a virtual role at the point work is 
performed and machines play a physical role such as doctors performing 
telepresence surgery.
yy ‘Virtual–virtual’ – meaning both humans and machines play a virtual role such 
as in call centres, with human agents working in tandem with virtual cognitive 
agents.
Interestingly, whether humanoid or non-humanoid, and whether working physically or 
virtually, the various robots concerned are all being socialised to perform their unique 
tasks most effectively. Physical robots are being socialised to operate seamlessly within 
human spaces and adhere to human behavioural norms, and virtual robots are being 
socialised via their appearance and natural language capabilities.
The key point is that it’s not just machines that are getting social; it’s that humans are 
getting instrumented as well, all of which amplifies the possibilities to optimise work 
activities. Let’s look at some examples of both of these areas. 
115

vice versa

Instrumenting the human 
As consumers, we’re all becoming instrumented and taking advantage of the wealth 
of wearables and sensors now on the market. This ‘quantified self’ concept helps us 
to monitor our health and fitness and take advantage of the masses of data that are 
produced as we go about our daily lives. The pace of instrumentation is picking up in 
the workplace as well, as employers seek to track employee behaviour and optimise 
work activities. 
Steve Cousins, CEO of Savioke, a company that manufactures autonomous robot helpers 
for the services industry, sees smart watches, as well as smartphones, as a powerful 
way for his team to connect into their robots currently deployed in trials at the Aloft 
hotel chain. This modern-day ‘telepathy’, as Steve sees it, helps employees to monitor 
the robots at scale and intervene in rare cases of exceptions where the robots need a 
helping hand.
In the logistics arena, DHL found that by instrumenting its warehouse pickers with smart 
glasses, together with AR software, it was able to improve the picking process by 25 
per cent. By instrumenting its workers in this manner, compared to handheld devices, 
116

TRANSFORMING THE DIGITAL WORKPLACE
DHL was able to move to a ‘hands-free’ optimised process where workers claimed they 
barely felt the glasses once they were wearing them. 
At the higher end of the spectrum, in terms of wearables, initiatives such as the Q-Warrior 
helmet and the TALOS ‘Iron Man’ suit in the military are instrumenting soldiers to radi­
cally improve their situational awareness, giving them super-human capabilities. 
In virtual work scenarios, the ‘Double’ telepresence robot, ‘da Vinci’ surgical system, 
and manually piloted drones and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are all examples of 
how we’re instrumenting humans to be able to extend our reach and conduct work in 
remote locations. 
Socialising the machine 
In health care, Aethon’s Tug robot is a smart autonomous robot that delivers medicines 
and supplies in hospitals. Having logged over 1 million miles in hospitals to date, it has 
been socialised to safely navigate around people and obstacles and can even take the 
elevator. One of the aspects of its socialisation is that it makes use of existing hospi­
tal facilities and infrastructure and doesn’t need dedicated hallways or large docking 
areas. 
Jim Lawton is Chief Product and Marketing Officer at Rethink Robotics. The company 
makes the Baxter industrial robot, well recognised by its iconic ‘face screen’. One of the 
many ways Rethink Robotics has socialised its robots is by implementing anticipatory 
intelligence so the robot physically communicates where it’s about to move. It does this 
by moving its head, its eyes, and then its arm when reaching for objects to instill a com­
fort level with workers who are shoulder to shoulder with the machine. 
Rethink is bringing instrumented workers into the equation as well. Its new Sawyer 
robot has a second screen capability where supervisors can use a tablet to gain access 
to robot performance across the fleet. In addition, Lawton and the team are exploring 
how operational data gathered from ‘smart robots and smart workers’ can be analysed 
to further optimise work cells in manufacturing. 
IPSoft’s Amelia is a cognitive virtual employee that speaks, reads, writes and learns on 
the job, just like a human employee. According to Jonathan Crane, the company’s chief 
commercial officer, she has emotions and intelligence, so she understands what people 
ask, even what they feel, and can empathise in both her facial and spoken response. If 
Amelia doesn’t understand a request, she transfers the caller to an agent, then observes 
and learns so she can do it herself the next time. Amelia is being used in call centres to 
transform the labour mix with ‘virtual engineers’. This helps ‘automate the tactical, and 
populate the strategic’, according to Jonathan, letting staff focus on higher-value-added 
projects and typically reducing labour costs by 30 to 35 per cent.
Even when we look at fully autonomous vehicles such as self-driving cars, the cars are 
being socialised to be overly cautious when manoeuvring to help avoid surprises for 
passengers and pedestrians alike. Soft robotics is another area of innovation where 
robots are being designed with soft and deformable structures to work with unknown 
objects, in rough terrains, or with direct human contact. 
117

MASTERING DIGITAL BUSINESS
Implications for managers
So, given these two converging themes of instrumenting the human and socialising the 
machine, what are the implications for managers? 
Over time, we’ll start to see more scenarios toward the centre – more highly instru­
mented humans and more highly socialised machines working together. The business 
enablers won’t be just one technology. The instrumented human will combine sensors, 
wearables and AR with powerful analytics delivered via the cloud, while the socialised 
machine will combine sensors, geolocation, expressive behaviours, empathy, knowl­
edge, memory and speech. 
We can also expect human–machine collaboration to operate at scale. We’ll see one-to-
one interactions, as well as one-to-many and many-to-many interactions as benefits are 
scaled up across the enterprise. Google’s recent patent envisioning cloud control of an 
army of robots is just one example. 
The specific human–machine scenarios will change over the duration of a particular 
customer’s journey or a worker’s business process. For example, within an airport set­
ting, instrumented passengers will use a smart watch for notifications and way-finding, 
and will interact with an array of robots including self-service bag drop machines, 
robotic butlers to handle luggage and even robotic valets to park their cars. 
Adriaan den Heijer, Senior Vice President at Air France-KLM, sees numerous appli­
cations where robotics can play a role from the passenger side, where we can find 
answers by combining robotics together with the human touch, to baggage handling 
robots that free up employees to become process operators. 
The key for managers in the years ahead will be flexibility and finding the sweet spot 
for human–machine collaboration based on the nature of the work. Anywhere on the 
continuum is fine in terms of human instrumentation and machine socialisation, and 
the precise location is task dependent. 
Workers will need to be adaptable for these different scenarios with machines, just as 
adaptability is paramount when working with other humans. Machines will need to be 
highly adaptable as well, as evidenced by the recent winner of the Defense Advanced 
Research Projects Agency (DARPA) robotics challenge, which was able to roll on four 
wheels as well as walk on two legs.3 For managers envisioning the future digital work­
place, consider the full range of options available – instrument and socialise whenever 
possible to create smooth, optimised interfaces where you can hand-off the baton in 
record time. 
CASE STUDY: AMAZON
Transforming delivery services
In July 2016, online retailer Amazon teamed up with the UK Government to ‘explore the 
steps needed to make the delivery of parcels by small drones a reality’.4 One of Ama­
zon’s goals is to use drones to safely deliver parcels to customers within 30 minutes of icon
118

TRANSFORMING THE DIGITAL WORKPLACE
the time the order is placed online. In addition to having an anticipated positive impact 
on the digital customer experience in terms of improved delivery times and an alto­
gether different way of receiving your parcels, this initiative and others like it represent 
some significant changes for the digital workplace as well.
In this scenario, rather than driving traditional delivery vans, workers will be piloting 
fleets of drones. This is yet another example of human–machine collaboration in the 
future digital workplace where the work is performed in a virtual–physical scenario 
with remote human pilots controlling tens or even hundreds of drones performing 
at-home delivery.
Operating from Amazon distribution centres, under the brand of Amazon Prime Air, 
the drones are able to fly for several miles at speeds of around 50 mph carrying loads 
weighing up to 5 lb. Some of the key operating parameters for the Amazon drones are 
listed in Table 9.1. Current US Government restrictions limit drones to line-of-sight 
operation, with each drone having a physical pilot controlling it from the ground. Clearly 
for this kind of business model to succeed financially, the drones need to be piloted 
beyond line of sight, with workers operating far more than one drone at a time.

The Amazon initiative, in the concept stage at the time of writing, aims to explore some 
of these challenges and opportunities by looking at: 
beyond line of sight operations in rural and suburban areas, testing sensor 
performance to make sure the drones can identify and avoid obstacles, and 
flights where one person operates multiple highly-automated drones.5

MASTERING DIGITAL BUSINESS
Other companies such as Matternet, based in Menlo Park, California, are taking a 
slightly different approach to piloting their drones by using autonomous drones 
that operate between pre-defined routes, using a mobile application to select the 
destination and to initiate take-off. Matternet’s drones are being used in production 
in many Third World countries and elsewhere to deliver medical supplies in hard-
to-reach areas.
Whether human-piloted or completely autonomous, drone technology is revolu­
tionising last mile logistics and is continuing to push the envelope in terms of how 
digital business is performed from city centres to some of the most remote places 
on earth.
KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR CHAPTER 9
yy Since humans are driving the innovation around automation and robotics, 
we’re consciously (and perhaps unconsciously) carving out our future roles 
in the workplace side by side with machines. 
yy Rather than harsh boundaries between humans and machines, we’re 
creating a converged future where work processes are being optimised 
in two converging directions: instrumentation of human processes and 
socialisation of machine processes, so the two can work in greater harmony 
together. 
yy By instrumenting the human and socialising the machine, we can re-design 
business processes to optimise the blend of human–machine participation 
and interaction – and complete tasks far more efficiently than either could 
individually.
yy Whether humanoid or non-humanoid, and whether working physically or 
virtually, the various robots concerned are all being socialised to perform 
their unique tasks most effectively. Physical robots are being socialised to 
operate seamlessly within human spaces and adhere to human behavioural 
norms, and virtual robots are being socialised via their appearance and 
natural language capabilities.
yy The key for managers in the years ahead will be flexibility and finding the 
sweet spot for human–machine collaboration based on the nature of the 
work. Anywhere on the continuum is fine in terms of human instrumentation 
and machine socialisation, and the precise location is task dependent.

Information is the oil of the 21st century, and analytics is the combustion engine.

Peter Sondergaard, Gartner Research1
Throughout our examination of mastering digital business, we’ve seen examples of how 
information and data are playing a fundamental yet highly differentiating role across 
all aspects of digital transformation. New sources of data and new ways of storing, 
processing and analysing this data are being used to enable new platform business 
models, to create new value-added services by tapping into the data swirling around 
existing products and services, to differentiate the digital customer experience, to 
improve operational efficiencies (as we saw in our Industrial Internet scenarios such 
as manufacturing), to enable breakthrough performance (as we saw with the Mercedes 
AMG Petronas Formula One Team) and much more. 
According to Tom Reilly, CEO of Cloudera, a data analytics company, the last six to ten 
years have seen the world become highly inter-connected. We’re now connected to a 
tremendous amount of data coming in from smartphones, apps, social media, and an 
increasing number of sensors and IoT devices. This newly connected world is creating 
both threats and opportunities for every industry and every company. According to IDC,2 
By 2020, organizations able to analyze all relevant data and deliver actionable 
information will achieve an extra $430 billion in productivity benefits over their 
less analytically oriented peers. 
Correspondingly, the use cases for leveraging this information via big data analytics are 
now a board-level discussion. 
In this chapter, we’ll pull all this together to explore and summarise the key board-level 
use cases for big data analytics, the strategies for how to think about exploiting this data 
in unique new ways, and the architectural approaches to transform your existing data 
infrastructure to enable a truly data-driven enterprise.
BOARD-LEVEL USE CASES FOR BIG DATA ANALYTICS
In the world of big data, we’ve heard for many years about the 3Vs – namely, the volume, 
velocity and variety – of big data that differentiate it from the traditional highly struc­
tured data we’re used to working with in the years, and even decades, past. 
121

MASTERING DIGITAL BUSINESS
In terms of volume, the digital universe is doubling in size every two years and will 
reach 44 trillion gigabytes by 2020, up from 4.4 trillion gigabytes in 2013.3 It’s esti­
mated that most companies in the US have at least 100 terabytes of data stored.4 It’s 
also estimated that organisations typically only analyse about 5 per cent of this data, so 
clearly new techniques are required to store and analyse this ever-increasing volume 
of information.
In terms of velocity, real-time data is now streaming in from an ever-increasing number 
of sensors and IoT devices as well as from countless customer interactions and trans­
actions worldwide. As we saw earlier, the Mercedes AMG Petronas Formula One Team 
now collects more data within a single race weekend than they did across every race 
weekend from 1998 to 2006 combined. Given approximately 16 to 19 races per Formula 
One racing season, this equates to over 150 times the data volume being collected 
compared to prior years. The New York Stock Exchange captures 1 terabyte5 of trade 
information during each trading session. On the consumer side, if we look at the fourth 
annual installment of the ‘Data Never Sleeps’ study by business intelligence and data 
visualisation company, Domo,6 we find that every single minute of every day, there are:
yy 69,500,000 words translated by Google;
yy 18,264,840 MB of data consumed by US wireless users;
yy 3,567,850 text messages sent in the US;
yy 99,206 requests answered by Siri;
yy 86,805 hours of video streamed by Netflix subscribers.
New techniques to deal with the velocity of big data need to clearly support the pro­
cessing and analysis of real-time streaming data – from people, things and organisa­
tions – so that business decisions can be made as soon as information is captured and 
insights are revealed. 
In terms of variety, data is now coming in from a wide array of sources ranging from 
social media, to IoT devices, to live video feeds and much more. It’s estimated that 70 
to 80 per cent of an organisation’s data is now unstructured, so this presents a large 
opportunity for analysis and decision making. New techniques to deal with the variety of 
big data need to make both structured and unstructured information readily and equally 
available, so that insights can be generated by looking across all data sources. 
In its early years, big data discussions were confined to the ‘what’ of big data in terms of 
describing the 3Vs and even adding a fourth V of ‘veracity’. Organisations were focused 
on tools and technology and experimented with various big data pilots and proof of con­
cepts to test out the technology and uncover the technical possibilities. Today, organi­
sations are moving on to the ‘why’, ‘how’ and ‘where’ of big data in terms of why it’s 
of business benefit, and how and where it can be applied in production deployments 
across the business. 
So what are the key board-level use cases now that the concept of big data has been 
around for several years and organisations have moved well beyond discussions about 
tools and technology and are now squarely focused on exploiting the most promising 
use cases they can uncover? While there are hundreds of use cases for gaining insights 
122

GAINING INSIGHTS FROM ANALYTICS
from analytics, if we distil them down in terms of a factor analysis, we find that they can 
be grouped into three key areas: 
yy customer insights; 
yy operational insights;
yy risk management insights.
These three types of insights, and their corresponding sources of data and typical ben­
efits are illustrated in Table 10.1. In all three of these use cases, organisations can 
additionally use the insights from big data analytics to create new digital services and 
even entirely new business models. 
It’s important to mention that there’s also some overlap and connectivity between 
these use cases, especially when it comes to the sources of data for each of them. For 
example, customer insights can be informed not only from data from customers, but 
also from data from things. This is the data that can be captured about the customer’s 
usage of your products, whether it’s a car, a home appliance, a fitness band or even a 
toothbrush. This is what I call the ‘Internet of Behaviours’. It’s the detailed usage and 
behavioural data that’s collected as individuals use various IoT devices and systems. It 
provides compelling insights that organisations can use to gain a better understanding 
of their customers in terms of their preferences, behaviours and interests.

MASTERING DIGITAL BUSINESS
Customer insights
We saw earlier in Chapter 8, ‘Enhancing the digital customer experience’, how analytics 
is one of the key ‘digital experience enablers’ contributing to the overall digital customer 
experience. Not only does it appear explicitly in two of our ten DCX Bill of Rights (that 
is, ‘The right to be known and understood’ and ‘The right to information, analytics and 
recommendations’), but it can also be argued that it underpins every single ‘right’. Data 
is perhaps the single most important digital experience enabler because it can provide 
true insights to help organisations understand customer preferences, needs, interests, 
behaviours, location, language and sentiment at any point in time. 
According to Mr Reilly, with more information available now than ever before, we can 
use this data to predict and anticipate customer needs and translate this into business 
outcomes that are significant for board members. As an example, in the telecommu­
nications industry, organisations can use their customer insights to reduce customer 
churn by anticipating, predicting and reaching out to customers who are showing signs 
of unhappiness. This can be detected in the data by analysing dropped customer sup­
port calls, social media postings and so on. Improving customer churn even by one or 
two percentage points can be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, which would oth­
erwise be lost to the competition. 
In the banking industry, understanding customers across all physical and digital 
channels (for example, branch, web, mobile, voice, email and chat) can help to build a 
360-degree profile of the customer. This profile can be used to better understand the 
customer’s household and anticipate their financial needs. For example, you may know 
that your customer is about to take a vacation and may be able to offer them a suitable 
loan to help cover their expenses. 
In the health care industry, monitoring and understanding a patient’s health status and 
activity, including diet and exercise, between their scheduled doctor or hospital visits, 
and pro-actively reaching out to them with advice and support, can help to reduce the 
number of visits required and thus translate into more effective and cost-efficient deliv­
ery of health care.
Operational insights
We saw earlier in Chapter 4 how analytics is being used as a key service within platform 
business models such as the GE Predix platform to support use cases such as predic­
tive maintenance. By collecting and analysing the data from industrial assets, organi­
sations can gain real-time insights that can help to optimise industrial infrastructure 
and operations at the individual asset level or even across their entire fleet or set of 
factories.
These operational insights can be applied to improve IT performance as well as busi­
ness performance. Data analytics company, Cloudera, for example, instruments its soft­
ware so it essentially ‘phones home’ to provide a health check. This enables Cloudera 
to pro-actively predict which customers in their environments are about to have a 
problem. In fact, 20 per cent of Cloudera customer support cases are now created by 
Cloudera on the customer’s behalf. Mr Reilly anticipates that soon organisations across 
124

GAINING INSIGHTS FROM ANALYTICS
many industries will be shifting their paradigm from retroactively fixing assets and 
infrastructure to pro-actively maintaining their assets and infrastructure before they 
experience issues. 
As an example of the business benefits of gaining operational insights, Siemens PLM, 
a software company in the enterprise manufacturing and supply chain space, was able 
to realise an annual saving among its client base conservatively estimated at between 
$15 and 25 million, based on its client’s ability to identify and address supply chain 
issues in near real time. Siemens utilised an enterprise data hub (EDH) within their 
supply chain product quality solution, OmneoTM, to gain a 360-degree view of product 
performance across the supply chain – from suppliers, manufacturing, equipment, field 
service and repair/re-manufacturing operations. The increased visibility enabled by 
this solution via the use of big data analytics meant that problems could be identified 
and addressed as soon as they started occurring, enabling Siemens’ manufacturing 
clients to spend more time resolving challenges and less time trying to locate them.7 
Reduced business risk
When it comes to reducing business risk, some of the key data analytics use cases 
in this category include security analytics, anti-money laundering and fraud detection. 
Since today’s cybercriminals are so advanced with their tools and techniques, organisa­
tions can’t rely on signature-based detection methods anymore and need to look at user 
behaviour and anomaly detection instead. This anomalous behaviour can come from 
cybercriminals or even from employees in terms of an insider threat. Apache Hadoop 
(the foundation of Google’s IT infrastructure), with its ability to process large quantities 
of real-time data, is becoming a pre-eminent tool for conducting security analytics to 
detect these kinds of issues. 
The same techniques can also be applied when looking for fraudulent activities or when 
looking to prevent money laundering. If an organisation detects anomalous behaviour, 
then it can examine that behaviour in more detail with sophisticated pattern matching 
algorithms looking across various digital breadcrumbs to determine if there is underly­
ing fraud or money laundering underway. 
As an example of reduced business risk, Markerstudy, a leading UK-based general 
insurer serving over 1.75 million customers, was able to reduce claim fraud with sav­
ings of £5 million and increase their new policy count by 120 per cent in 18 months. The 
insurer used a big data analytics platform powered by Apache Hadoop across key areas 
of its operation, including customer insights, risk and underwriting, as well as real-time 
fraud detection and prevention. 
CASE STUDY: MARKERSTUDY
REAL-TIME CLAIMS FRAUD DETECTION AND PREVENTION
Background
Markerstudy is a leading UK-based general insurer serving over 1.75 million custom­
ers. The company was established in 2001 and provides insurance solutions primarily icon
125

MASTERING DIGITAL BUSINESS
through a network of over 3,000 brokers and intermediaries. With annual revenues of 
over £1.4 billion, the company specialises in commercial and personal auto including 
niche sectors such as young drivers, high performance cars, taxis and fleet insurance.
Challenge
One of the primary business drivers for Markerstudy to move to a big data analytics 
platform was to enhance the performance of its common portal for centralised rat­
ing for intermediaries. The portal, called the Insurer-Hosted-Rating Hub, was seeing 
increasing volumes of data and generating close to 25 million quotes per day. Over 
time, storing and accessing the data had become costly and difficult. In addition, older 
records had to be deleted due to various technical restrictions around capacity and 
storage. Only sub-sets of data were available at any given time for analysis, limiting 
visibility into trends and patterns impacting the business. 
Solution
Moving to a big data analytics platform enabled Markerstudy to aggregate, store, 
correlate and analyse terabytes of data cost effectively, while tapping into new data 
sources that were previously unavailable. While the initial focus was to enhance the 
performance of its centralised rating portal, Markerstudy expanded the use of its big 
data analytics platform to encompass other areas of its operations, including risk and 
underwriting, pricing, claims fraud and customer insight. Data is now analysed from 
12 different internal and external sources including policy and claim systems, adjuster 
notes, social feeds, weather data, traffic patterns and third-party data such as Experian. 
Results
In terms of performance gains, the company is now able to process 100 per cent of its 
quote data within seconds, compared to the previous environment where only 5 per 
cent of the quote data was available in a seven-hour window. Markerstudy now ingests 
over 20,000 messages per second, which is more than 50 times the volume that was 
ingested previously. 
Better fraud detection and prevention at the point of quote has enabled Markerstudy to 
reduce claim costs by £5 million. The company has also seen a 60 per cent reduction 
in fraudulent applications. In terms of cost savings by moving to a big data analytics 
platform, it has seen a 20 per cent annual operational cost saving on rate updates, 
which previously had to be done on 15 different systems.
DATA STRATEGIES
It might be argued that access to more data gives people more ability to make the data 
say what they want, as in the case of data around which there are conflicting interests 
such as political campaigns and so on. Another argument is that collecting and storing 
more data opens up even more opportunities for that information to be used inappro­
priately or in ways that may impact upon privacy and security. 
However, if you’re looking to make sense of data by uncovering insights to support any 
of the board-level use cases that we’ve discussed, the general rule of thumb for analyt­
ics is that ‘more actually is more’. Having access to more data simply gives you a more 
126

GAINING INSIGHTS FROM ANALYTICS
complete picture of your environment and whatever it is you want to observe, analyse 
or even predict. The key questions are what types of additional data do you need, and 
how can you uncover the patterns? 
In most cases, there are four types of additional data you can tap into (see Figure 10.1):
yy historical data;
yy real-time data;
yy more frequent or higher-resolution data;
yy new sources of data.
If you think about your current data sources, for example, you can tap into more histori­
cal data, more real-time data, and more frequent or higher-resolution data (that is, at 
a higher sampling rate such as every hour instead of every day for example), so that’s 
three additional ways you can enhance what you’re currently collecting where it makes 
sense to do so. The types of data we’re talking about might include time series data 
such as stock trades, video surveillance, weather data, sales data, real-time feeds from 
intelligent sensors and so on. 
The fourth option is to tap into additional data sources, which may provide additional 
insights either individually or in combination with your current data sources. The abil­
ity to ‘connect the dots’ is a great way to summarise this aspect and, in the context of 
national security, it has been highlighted in several government testimonies, including 
the heads of various government intelligence agencies. 
Figure 10.1  Four options for tapping into additional data from new and existing 
sourcesFigure 10.1
127

MASTERING DIGITAL BUSINESS
Typical additional data sources may be structured or unstructured feeds that help to 
uncover patterns and provide additional insights. The typical example here is obviously 
feeds from social media, which help to provide input on customer sentiment, but which 
could additionally be leveraged for aspects such as uncovering new product or service 
opportunities, operational efficiency improvements, market pricing dynamics and cus­
tomer satisfaction.
Historical data
For every business scenario, your needs will vary, and you’ll want to carefully pick and 
choose between the various options listed above. For example, if we look at historical 
data, in financial services, access to more historical data can give analysts more infor­
mation to feed into their predictive models. In health care, electronic health records are 
capturing massive amounts of clinical data that can be mined for information to improve 
preventative care and disease treatment. 
For the typical enterprise, this storage of historical data raises important questions about 
how much data to keep and how much may be useful and relevant for future needs. An 
additional issue, related to backward compatibility, is ensuring that the historical data 
is stored appropriately so it can be easily accessed in the future. Vint Cerf, Google’s Vice 
President and Chief Internet Evangelist, has highlighted this issue, noting that ‘backward 
compatibility is very hard to preserve over very long periods of time’.8
Fortunately, a number of innovative solutions are appearing for long-term digital data 
storage, including the so-called ‘superman memory crystals’ invented at the University 
of Southampton in the UK. By using nanostructured glass, scientists at the university 
have been able to save digital copies of major documents from human history, including 
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Magna Carta, which could survive 
the human race and last for billions of years. The technique uses an ultrafast laser to 
write data to five-dimensional (5D) storage with ‘unprecedented properties including 
360 TB/disc data capacity, thermal stability up to 1,000°C and virtually unlimited life­
time at room temperature’.9 In fact, the storage lifetime is up to 13.8 billion years at an 
even hotter 190°C. The 5D storage is achieved by using tiny physical structures called 
‘nanogratings’ and using reflected light to provide information about the nanograting’s 
orientation, the strength of the light it reflects and its three-dimensional location.10
Real-time data
In terms of collecting and analysing more real-time data, this obviously has many scenarios 
in the public sector (for example, crime prevention, intelligence, traffic flows) and in health 
care, manufacturing processes and so on. It can also be applied to help improve revenues 
and operational efficiencies in retail where items such as real-time sentiment analysis, 
sales analysis and supply chain monitoring can better inform decision makers. 
A good example is P&G’s business sphere, a visually immersive data environment set 
up in over 40 locations around the world, which is an ‘integration of technology, visu­
alization, and information that enables leaders to drill down into data to get answers 
in real-time’. The business sphere environment is similar to a ‘mission control’ type of 
setting, where individuals are surrounded by a wall of high-definition screens providing 
real-time information and analytics. According to P&G, 
128

GAINING INSIGHTS FROM ANALYTICS
one supply chain example leveraged supply chain sufficiency models to bring 
together multiple data points, analytics, and visualizations. This resulted in an 
inventory reduction of 25% and savings of tens of millions of dollars”.11 
More frequent or higher resolution data
When we think about more frequent or higher resolution data, this could be a finer 
sampling rate in terms of a time series or perhaps a higher resolution graphical (spatial) 
model. As an example, if you’re scheduling work crews on construction sites across a 
large city such as London or Chicago, having access to more granular weather forecast 
data may enable you to keep more crews productive in periods of stormy weather by 
knowing exactly where the weather may be good or bad.
New sources of data
Finally, tapping into additional data sources to connect the dots and glean new insights 
is the most commonly cited example around big data analytics. It’s also perhaps the 
hardest challenge to solve in terms of knowing what to look for. It’s relatively easy 
to analyse your existing data sources, since you already have those feeds and know 
how to process and interpret them. With new feeds from multiple data sources, the 
challenge is in knowing where to connect the dots and what the uncovered patterns 
may actually be telling you. I’m a strong believer that solving these challenges takes 
more than data scientists alone – it takes a multi-disciplinary team of IT staff, data 
scientists and industry domain experts to put in place the right technical underpin­
nings, including suitable visualisation technologies, and then iteratively analyse and 
interpret the information. 
Hopefully, these four options for tapping into additional data from both new and existing 
sources may get you thinking about how you might further utilise your existing data in 
addition to the wealth of new data sources you now have access to.
DATA ARCHITECTURE
Equipped with board-level use cases for big data analytics, and strategies for how to 
think about exploiting this data in unique new ways, the next step is to craft an archi­
tectural approach to transform your existing data infrastructure to enable a truly data-
driven enterprise.
A new data infrastructure is necessary because traditional data infrastructures are not 
designed to support the volume, velocity and variety of big data, and additionally now 
need to deal with data that is widely dispersed across both traditional and cloud-based 
environments. 
The EDH
One of the first steps to set up the new data infrastructure is to establish an EDH. 
According to Mr Reilly, moving to an EDH is the key approach by which organisations can 
become information-centric and tap into the board-level use cases they wish to pursue. 
129

MASTERING DIGITAL BUSINESS
The EDH provides a single place where all the data that your business generates can be 
easily accessed by any application or any user in a more agile fashion. 
If you’ve come across the term ‘enterprise data lake’, then the EDH is one particular 
instance of a data lake. The enterprise data lake is more of a conceptual term, since 
in reality many customers need multiple EDHs to meet various requirements such as 
country-specific data privacy laws or to support different data storage and analysis 
needs in the cloud versus on-premise. 
Enterprise data lakes are typically based on Apache Hadoop, leverage the stability, scal­
ability and flexibility features of Hadoop for data management and then couple that 
with additional enterprise-level features related to security, governance, management, 
support and a commercial ecosystem that IT organisations require. The EDH provides 
unlimited storage of data in its original formats and serves as a data staging area for 
downstream systems. 
Integrating the data architecture into the overall IT transformation
As organisations transform their IT environments to support digital business, one of 
the questions that arises in connection with the data architecture is how to integrate it 
with other IT environments that may be transforming simultaneously, such as the move 
to platform business model technologies and architectures, or the move to software-
defined data centre technologies and architectures. 
According to Mr Reilly, the beauty of building an EDH on top of Hadoop is that the open 
source nature of Hadoop provides an assurance of longevity and continual innovation. 
Since the move to an EDH is a decision that will need to last the next 10 to 20 years, 
a customer who has adopted an open source strategy can benefit from the innovation 
across the partner ecosystem (in Cloudera’s case over 2,400 companies) as well as 
having the best options for interoperability and integration. 
In the subsequent chapters, we’ll continue to explore the overall IT transformation and 
look at the steps organisations can take to optimise their digital infrastructure, learn 
how to master the digital services lifecycle, and discover how to simultaneously trans­
form both IT and the business so that you can gain early benefits for customers and end 
users at the same time as IT transforms its own delivery model.

INFRASTRUCTURE AND SIMPLIFYING 
MANAGEMENT
In the new world, it is not the big fish which eats the small fish, it’s the fast fish 
which eats the slow fish. 

Klaus Schwab, Founder and Executive Chairman, World Economic Forum1
Digital transformation is about a lot more than your front-end digital customer experi­
ence. It requires a business-critical IT infrastructure on the back-end as well. In the 
previous chapter, we saw the importance of implementing new data infrastructures to 
deal with the 3Vs of big data and the strategic role of EDHs in supporting board-level 
use cases for big data analytics. Another vital element in digital infrastructure has 
clearly been the move to cloud computing and everything-as-a-service. 
Over the years, the agility and cost savings benefits of moving to the cloud have been so 
compelling that many organisations have experienced ‘rogue IT’, where business units 
procure cloud-based applications and services outside the traditional channel of work­
ing through their IT organisation. If ‘rogue IT’ is what happens when business doesn’t 
speak to IT, then ‘rogue digital’ may be what happens if the CDO doesn’t speak to the 
CIO or vice versa.
To implement a next-generation digital infrastructure, capable of supporting the busi­
ness for many years ahead, what’s needed is a focus on a number of aspects that span 
the roles of both the CDO and the CIO: a focus on the customer experience across all 
new digital channels, processes and devices; a focus on business-critical ‘interactions’ 
as well as ‘transactions’; a focus on new forms of business-critical infrastructure, such 
as cloud service brokers and software-defined principles, to cost-effectively deliver 
increased service levels; and a focus on new approaches to provide enterprise-grade 
security against today’s emerging threats.
To embark on a digital transformation journey strategically, as opposed to an ad hoc, 
piecemeal approach, it’s important to think about the highly virtualised, highly distrib­
uted, data centre of the future and the key capabilities that will need to be in place 
from an enterprise IT perspective. After all, although a rising percentage of data centre 
workloads are migrating to the cloud, the fact is that we’ll be living in a hybrid IT envi­
ronment for many years to come and it will be comprised of a mix of traditional data 
centre, outsourced, and public and private cloud deployment environments supported 
by a multitude of providers.
132

OPTIMISING AND SIMPLIFYING
For pioneering CIOs, the challenge is therefore to support the CDO’s digital transforma­
tion objectives in a highly agile, flexible, manageable and secure manner by putting in 
place an innovative IT infrastructure that can serve as a foundational platform. This plat­
form will need to blend the ‘old’ with the ‘new’. It will need to retain the business-critical 
capabilities of the traditional data centre, yet expand this to support modern, digitally 
transformed business processes and their associated users, applications and devices.
In this chapter, we’ll therefore take a look at the emerging requirements for the data

structure and to simplify its management, key components of the future data centre

EMERGING REQUIREMENTS FOR THE FUTURE DATA CENTRE
To get to the vision of the data centre of the future, where growth-oriented digital trans­
formation initiatives are enabled by an innovative IT infrastructure that serves as a 
highly agile foundational platform, CIOs are faced with four key emerging requirements: 
yy Agile and cost-effective infrastructure to deliver increased business-critical 
service levels – cost-effectively deliver increased business-critical service 
levels so that the enterprise can scale up to support an increasing number of 
business-critical applications and processes coming online.
yy Flexible assembly and dynamic execution of digital services from multiple 
cloud providers – support the flexible assembly and dynamic execution of 
digital services, often distributed across multiple cloud providers, to react 
rapidly to new digital initiatives and fast-changing business needs.
yy Integrated, data-driven view of service management across the enterprise – 
achieve an integrated view of service management across the enterprise, to 
deliver services more efficiently and effectively, and free up time and resources 
to focus on strategic initiatives.
yy Enterprise-grade security against today’s emerging threats – implement 
enterprise-grade security against today’s emerging threats so that the business 
value of new digital initiatives can be quickly realised and not delayed.
We’ll explore each of these areas in depth to understand exactly why they’re having an 
impact on the vision for the data centre of the future.
1. Agile and cost-effective infrastructure to deliver increased business-
critical service levels
With the exploding number of applications and business processes becoming digitised 
across the enterprise, one of the first requirements for CIOs is to seek out cost-effective 
approaches to scale up and support these new initiatives while maintaining business-
critical service levels. 
In recent years, a large part of this cost-effectiveness challenge has been addressed 
by ‘cloud first’ initiatives and the strategy of moving to a hybrid cloud model, where 
133

MASTERING DIGITAL BUSINESS
workloads are executed on a variety of deployment environments (such as public cloud, 
private cloud and traditional in-house or outsourced data centres) based on their par­
ticular needs such as financial, performance and security requirements.
Today, it’s estimated that anywhere from 40 to 60 per cent of enterprise applications are 
deemed mission critical. As more and more applications become mission critical, CIOs 
are looking to move to a more homogeneous foundation for their data centres so they 
can run these applications more cost-effectively and replace their former costly and 
proprietary systems, which also required highly specialised skill sets. 
End-user expectations related to application service levels have increased to the point 
where there is little tolerance for downtime of any kind. In addition, IT-related threats 
rank as the top threats to business continuity. For example, a recent report published 
by the Business Continuity Institute, in association with the British Standards Institution, 
revealed that IT-related threats are continuing to provide the greatest concern for 
organisations, ranking above other threats such as natural disasters, security incidents 
and industrial disputes.2
With the expanding scope of business-critical applications, and rising expectations for 
business-critical service levels, organisations need to find approaches that allow them 
to meet these new requirements in a cost-effective manner; to do ‘more with less’, with­
out having to increase their data centre footprint or labour requirements.
2. Flexible assembly and dynamic execution of digital services from 
multiple cloud providers
The second emerging requirement for the data centre of the future is to support the 
flexible assembly and dynamic execution of digital services. In many cases, digital 
business applications and processes need to be provisioned and executed on the fly, 
often drawing from software components and specialised services located across 
multiple providers in the public or private cloud, as well as the corporate data centre. 
Much like an orchestra, this requires careful arrangement to assemble the required 
elements in the correct manner. 
As the data centre evolves and becomes ever-more virtualised, the types of digital ser­
vices and their related deployment environments are getting more and more diverse. 
This is necessitating new techniques for managing and brokering these services. For 
example, the cloud service brokerage market, whereby software helps to integrate and 
aggregate services from diverse cloud providers, is projected to double in size over four 
years to become a $160 billion market by 2018.3 This means an increasing percentage 
of cloud services are being consumed via internal or external cloud service brokerages 
rather than directly. In terms of assembling services, hybrid clouds must now support 
static, deployment, event and dynamic service composition.4
The concepts of cloud management and cloud service brokering are key techniques that 
can help to deliver this flexible management of multiple cloud providers and orchestration 
of digital services in a more manageable and automated manner for data centre operations. 
While cloud management and brokering is one critical aspect – to create an efficient 
‘digital assembly line’ to support rapid provisioning of digital services – organisations 
134

OPTIMISING AND SIMPLIFYING
will need to drive further automation into the data centre as a whole. They can do this 
by adopting a software-defined approach that includes not just a virtualisation layer, but 
an integration layer leveraging service-oriented architectures (SOA) and APIs, a cloud 
service management and brokerage layer, an SDN layer and a fabric-based architecture.
3. Integrated, data-driven view of service management across the enterprise 
The third emerging requirement for the data centre of the future is to achieve an 
integrated view of service management across the enterprise, to deliver services more 
efficiently and effectively, and free up time and resources to focus on strategic initia­
tives. Service management refers to the discipline of designing, delivering, managing 
and improving the way business and IT services are used within an organisation.5 
Today, the emphasis of service management is as much on the demand side (that is, 
the level of service from the view of the customer or end user) as it is on the supply 
side (that is, the service provider, such as the infrastructure and operations organisa­
tion). Service management is also evolving from its roots in IT service management 
(ITSM), into business service management (that is, supporting many departments 
beyond IT such as facilities, field service, finance and HR), and now digital service 
management (that is, supporting all forms of digitally delivered services) as organisa­
tions seek to manage and improve their ever-expanding digital services. Today’s focus 
on service management also extends to managing a broad array of business and IT 
service providers and integrating them into an end-to-end set of services that meet 
business requirements. In the UK, this discipline is termed service integration and 
management or SIAM. 
The ability of IT organisations to manage the virtual data centre from end to end with a 
single service management dashboard is becoming increasingly important due to the 
constantly evolving nature of today’s highly virtualised, highly distributed data centres 
and the needs of today’s highly mobile workforce. Self-service portals are being used to 
let users submit service requests, log issues and track progress to get requests solved 
quickly and efficiently. A single service management dashboard provides service own­
ers with improved access to data and enhanced visibility required for more effective 
service delivery and lower total ownership costs.
The overall goal is to boost productivity and increase efficiency by delivering services 
faster through workflow automation; consolidating redundant systems; automating 
manual, repetitive tasks; standardising service processes; and offering superior self-
service capabilities to end users. 
4. Enterprise-grade security against today’s emerging threats 
The final requirement for the data centre of the future is that CIOs need to be able to 
configure and manage security in a software-defined manner with global company-
wide policies. The reason this is important is that most present-day security controls 
do not provide sufficient protection against today’s emerging threats and take too long 
to manually re-configure when new vulnerabilities are detected. 
Traditional ‘perimeter-based’ security models have been rendered ineffective by two 
evolving forces: the increasing sophistication, frequency and scale of cybercrime, and 
135

MASTERING DIGITAL BUSINESS
the rapid adoption of new, disruptive IT technologies. In addition, the next wave of emerg­
ing trends, such as the IoT, wearable devices and SDNs, are eroding this perimeter 
model even further. 
Today, 80 per cent of security spend is still going on firewalls, intrusion detection sys­
tems (IDS) and anti-virus solutions, despite these only being effective for 30 per cent 
of threats.6 Today’s cyber threats have a lot more to do with vulnerabilities exposed 
by technologies such as mobile, social and cloud. Perimeter-based strategies are now 
20 years old and today’s cybercriminals can simply go straight to the end user to get 
their data. As an example, according to Gartner, cloud and mobile implementations are 
already starting to bypass the security perimeter. By 2018, 25 per cent of corporate data 
traffic will bypass perimeter security (up from 4 per cent today) and flow directly from 
mobile devices to the cloud.7
Securing against emerging threats, including securing technologies such as social, 
mobile and cloud, also impacts time to market. According to the World Economic Forum, 
estimated delays addressing cyber risks associated with technologies such as cloud, 
IoT, mobile and social, ranged from 11 months for cloud to 3 months for social comput­
ing.8 To prevent unnecessary delays in realising the benefits of these various technology 
enablers, therefore, requires a larger percentage of spend to be redirected here versus 
perimeter security. 
A totally new approach to cyber security is required that will ultimately enable the trans­
formative benefits and usage of these enabling technologies without increasing the risk 
of sensitive data loss and jeopardising business-critical operations. Securing against 
emerging threats also necessitates an ability to configure and manage security in a 
more automated, software-defined manner with global company-wide policies so that 
new technologies can be adopted, implemented and secured efficiently without impact­
ing time to market.
IMPLEMENTING THE FUTURE DATA CENTRE
Having reviewed the emerging requirements for the data centre of the future, we’ll now 
take a look at the enabling technologies that can be applied to optimise data centre 
infrastructure and to simplify its management, key components of the future data 
centre services, and executive recommendations for implementation. 
Enabling technologies for the future data centre
In Chapter 4, we discussed how, as the IT industry moves into the next wave of corporate 
IT, the data centre of the future needs to become the workhorse that hosts, manages 
and delivers this compelling new experience for customers, partners and employ­
ees. We discussed how, just as the data centre needs to deliver a new generation of 
SMAC-enabled applications to digital consumers, and to the digital workforce, it also 
needs to embrace the changes occurring within data centre technologies themselves. 
We saw that there have been a number of technology innovations relating to data centre 
operations and management that have helped to optimise data centre processes as 
shown in Table 11.1.
136

Table 11.1  Enabling technologies for the future data centre
Technology enabler
Description
Fabric computing 
architectures
By adopting a fabric-based architecture, organisations can 
gain the agility and flexibility of shared resource pools such 
as compute, network and storage. This helps to avoid data 
centre sprawl, where each business-critical application 
used to have its own dedicated physical server, and helps 
to speed deployments and reduce costs.
Software-defined 
principles
By adopting software-defined principles and applying 
them to the management of applications, infrastructure 
and even security, organisations can implement a single, 
software-defined management approach across all 
environments and eliminate the need for many time-
consuming, labour-based activities such as network and 
firewall configuration.
SDDC
The concept of software-defined principles has given rise 
to SDNs as well as the broader concept of the SDDC where 
compute, network and storage resources are all software 
defined.
SIAM
By adopting SIAM tools and approaches, organisations can 
better manage a broad array of business and IT service 
providers and integrate them into an end-to-end set of 
services that meet business requirements.
Cloud management
By adopting advanced automation tools that extend 
across their hybrid cloud infrastructures, organisations 
can reduce their operational and infrastructure costs, 
and selectively run workloads in the infrastructure best 
suited to meet their financial, performance and security 
requirements.
Data management
By adopting an EDH, organisations can enable a single 
place where all the data that their business generates can 
be easily accessed by any application or any user in a more 
agile, timely and cost-effective fashion.
Security
By adopting security technologies that focus on micro-
segmentation as opposed to securing the traditional 
‘perimeter’, organisations can change the security 
paradigm and take a more dynamic, software-defined 
approach that enhances overall manageability.
137

MASTERING DIGITAL BUSINESS
For the CIO and data centre manager, it’s about taking advantage of the cost and agil­
ity benefits of these emerging platform and infrastructural technologies so that they 
can retain the business-critical capabilities of their traditional data centres, yet expand 
this to support modern, digitally transformed business processes and their associated 
users, applications and devices.
Key components of the future data centre
It’s important to look at the future data centre through the lens of five key service layers 
that support digital business initiatives by providing user experience services, applica­
tion services, infrastructure services, security services and management services (see 
Figure 11.1). 
When the future data centre requirements are implemented via the technology enablers 
outlined above, we see that they fit within five key service layers as follows:
1.	
User experience layer – provides end-to-end management across all new 
digital processes, channels and devices including mobile environment 
management, for a personalised, consistent and contextually relevant 
experience.
2.	
Application services layer – provides modernised services to support digital 
business requirements with social- and mobile-enablement, delivered via the 
cloud, with powerful analytics to deliver unique value propositions tailored to 
end-user needs and interests, preferences and behaviours.
3.	
Infrastructure layer – provides improved service levels, agility and flexibility 
via cloud computing platforms, cloud service brokerages, fabric computing 
architectures, software-defined principles and EDHs. 
4.	
Security layer – provides the new approaches required for improved 
cyber security against today’s emerging threats with flexible, impenetrable 
perimeters for data protection and security.
5.	
Management layer – provides a single, software-defined management 
capability across all environments – including applications, infrastructure and 
security – for agile and flexible management across the highly virtualised, 
distributed data centre.
Recommendations for the future data centre
We’ll now explore the core areas pertinent to the future, SDDC by looking at infrastruc­
ture services, security services and management services. 
Infrastructure services
You might think the increased scope for what needs business-critical support will create 
ever-increasing costs for IT. Fortunately, as business-critical application and workload 
requirements increase, CIOs are able to employ a number of enabling technologies to 
their advantage to expand their business-critical footprint and elevate service levels, 
while carefully managing costs. On-premise data centres can be modernised to utilise 
cost-effective Windows and Linux platforms and take advantage of cloud technology 
138

OPTIMISING AND SIMPLIFYING

Figure 11.1
139

MASTERING DIGITAL BUSINESS
to reduce data centre footprints and increase virtualisation and partitioning. In this 
manner, CIOs can deliver improved service levels, but at a more effective price point 
and with more flexibility to scale up and down on demand.
Traditionally, mission-critical applications have had to run on expensive UNIX and pro­
prietary environments, which required specialised IT skill sets that were very different 
from the rest of the data centre. Fabric-based platforms and infrastructure, coupled 
with Windows and Linux operating systems, can be utilised to deliver previously unat­
tainable combinations of cost-effective power, scalability, predictability, performance 
and security to support business-critical applications on low-cost, industry standard 
processors.
In addition, cloud computing can be utilised to reduce costs and improve agility and 
time to market by moving to a hybrid enterprise model where application workloads 
are placed on the most appropriate deployment environment (for example, public cloud, 
internal private cloud, hosted private cloud, outsourced or traditional environments) 
based upon their specific needs.
It is also important to support the agile assembly and dynamic execution of digital ser­
vices. To create an efficient ‘digital assembly line’ to support rapid provisioning of digital 
services, organisations will need to drive further automation into the data centre and 
adopt a software-defined approach that includes not just a virtualisation layer, but an 
integration layer (leveraging SOA and APIs), a cloud service brokerage layer, a software-
defined network layer and a fabric-based architecture.
Security services
Security is a key attribute that must be pervasive across the entire environment. A 
new ‘zero-trust’ (that is, trust no one) deeply embedded security approach, taking the 
inside-out view, is required to protect information and data across today’s highly diverse 
device types, virtualised applications and distributed infrastructures. Organisations 
must assume that cybercriminals will penetrate their perimeter, and prepare to protect 
their critical assets in several key ways:
yy By providing advanced data protection to all critical data assets, both at 
rest and in motion – implement enterprise- or even defence-grade encryption 
together with techniques such as micro-segmentation to secure data at rest 
and in motion.
yy By preventing lateral movement of malware within the IT environment – 
segregate data and transactions inside the network so only those with access 
know the transaction is occurring, making it undetectable to everyone else.
yy By protecting external IT assets such as cloud infrastructure, mobile devices 
and the IoT – for example in the cloud arena, secure and isolate communication 
between virtual resources in a multi-tenant environment to prevent theft or 
misuse of data within a tenant and between tenants.
yy By reducing the attack surface to inhibit more sophisticated forms of cyber-
attack – cloak servers and other computer or device entry points running 
sensitive applications or storing private information, making them undetectable 
to unauthorised users.
140

OPTIMISING AND SIMPLIFYING
One of the key techniques to address all these requirements is micro-segmenta­
tion. This is a security technique that essentially ring-fences high-value data and 
assets, located either within the data centre or external to the traditional secu­
rity perimeter, by providing protection to specific data, workloads, applications, 
devices or machines in specifically defined zones. The default approach for micro-
segmentation is to trust no one, so the entire mechanism is based on denying all 
communication unless specifically allowed.9 This helps to ensure protection from 
the lateral movement of advanced persistent threats and malware that may have 
already breached the traditional security perimeter and be already operating inside 
the IT environment. 
Micro-segmentation offers a fine-grained approach to implementing security policies, 
so it can be focused on the most high-value or highly sensitive sets of data, applica­
tions and devices – wherever they reside. It is an agile, cost-effective approach to secu­
rity since the security policies for micro-segmentation can be centrally managed and 
software-defined to provide a highly adaptive defence posture. 
In addition, by coupling micro-segmentation with threat intelligence from security ana­
lytics, organisations can actively seek out threats and apply real-time enforcement. 
Advanced predictive analysis of data coming from security information and event man­
agement and other systems can feed the threat intelligence into a real-time enforce­
ment engine, which can then communicate with the micro-segmentation technology to 
dynamically change its policies. This can help to isolate and quarantine the malware 
and limit its movement. 
Management services
By implementing a single, software-defined management capability across all service 
layers in the data centre – including the user experience layer, applications, infrastruc­
ture and security – organisations can ensure their business-critical operations can be 
rapidly configured and re-configured, and also seamlessly managed and monitored with 
visibility across the entire end-to-end infrastructure. 
The software-defined management capability should also extend across all deployment 
environments in the highly virtualised, distributed data centre – including public cloud, 
internal and hosted private cloud, outsourced and traditional environments.
Integrated service management approaches can be utilised to span all end points, appli­
cations and infrastructure with a set of consolidated and customised service views 
coupled with powerful analytics to generate actionable insights from systems data. 
This allows service management organisations to foresee impending outages or predict 
shifts in user demand for a more pro-active approach to service delivery.
The use of software-defined principles means that organisations can ‘wire once’ and 
avoid recurring, time-consuming, labour-based activities such as network and firewall 
configuration. For most effective manageability, it’s important to look beyond soft­
ware-defined networks and storage and towards emerging areas such as software-
defined security in order to automate as much as possible up and down the entire IT 
stack.
141

MASTERING DIGITAL BUSINESS
Summary
Today’s business-critical infrastructure and operations need to serve as a foundation for 
future needs and be aware of the new and constantly evolving scope of business-critical 
computing. This requires re-thinking process scope, application scope, service levels 
and business continuity plans, and risk management strategies – all in the context of 
today’s IT operations and data centres running low-cost, industry standard platforms 
to ‘achieve more for less’.
So doing will help digital transformation initiatives avoid ‘rogue digital’ and achieve the 
best of both worlds in terms of supporting the business-critical capabilities of traditional 
data centres together with the new demands of digital business models, processes, 
products and services. To achieve this bi-modal capability, the CDO and CIO will need to 
work in close collaboration to harness the full potential of their respective organisations.
KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR CHAPTER 11
yy To implement a next-generation digital infrastructure, capable of supporting 
the business for many years ahead, what’s needed is a focus on a number 
of aspects that span the roles of both the CDO and the CIO:
ß	 The digital customer experience across all new digital channels, processes and 
devices.
ß	 Business-critical ‘interactions’ as well as ‘transactions’.
ß	 New forms of business-critical infrastructure.
ß	 New approaches to enterprise-grade security.
yy Emerging requirements for the data centre of the future include:
ß	 agile and cost-effective infrastructure to deliver increased business-critical ser-
vice levels;
ß	 flexible assembly and dynamic execution of digital services from multiple cloud 
providers;
ß	 an integrated data-driven view of service management across the enterprise;
ß	 enterprise-grade security against today’s emerging threats.
yy CIOs and data centre managers can take advantage of the cost and agility 
benefits of new platform and infrastructural technologies so that they can 
retain the business-critical capabilities of their traditional data centres, 
yet expand to support digitally transformed business processes and their 
associated users, applications and devices.

LIFECYCLE AND SPEEDING TIME TO 
MARKET
Speed is the new currency of business. 

Marc R. Benioff, Chairman and CEO, Salesforce1
Mastery of digital services is going to become a key competency for organisations to 
grow their business and build sustainable competitive advantage in the years ahead. It’s 
no longer sufficient to have an innovative set of products or services; you have to be a 
master of how you design, develop, deploy, manage and continually evolve your digital 
services as well. 
In this chapter, we’ll explore how organisations can master the digital services lifecycle 
and look at the set of innovative service delivery techniques that are becoming essential 
to developing an end-to-end capability that spans design and development all the way 
to deployment and management.
Even if your company delivers physical goods, digital services – in the form of both inter­
actions and transactions – will likely be a growing part of your business both now and in 
the years ahead. In 2015, the service sector was close to 65 per cent of gross domestic 
product (GDP) worldwide2 and according to McKinsey, ‘services are expected to account 
for about three-quarters of global growth over the coming decade’.3 
If we look at interactions, digital interfaces and channels are likely the primary way 
your customer engages with your business. This has benefits for both the customer 
and your organisation. For example, digital customer care (‘eCare’) studies, such as that 
conducted by McKinsey, who looked at the telecommunications industry, have clearly 
shown that eCare can both lower costs as well as enhance customer satisfaction.4 They 
found that solutions such as digital chat amounted to 54 per cent of a call centre’s 
cost when compared to voice, and that customer satisfaction was 19 percentage points 
higher for those who took a purely digital customer service journey compared to a 
purely ‘traditional’ journey. 
If we look at transactions – that is, revenue opportunities – the product purchase is a one-
time transaction, but, as we’ve seen previously, the services associated with the product 
provide the opportunity for continual customer engagement and annuity revenues.
Just look at the connected home for example. A home security system may be just 
a few hundred pounds for the physical equipment, but the monthly service fees for 
145

MASTERING DIGITAL BUSINESS
monitoring, remote viewing on mobile devices and cloud storage of camera footage 
provide a perpetual revenue stream. The Nike+ running app and ecosystem is another 
oft-cited example of a suite of services wrapped around a physical product. 
Of course, the service-wrapping concept also extends into industry and B2B scenarios, 
such as the Industrial Internet and Industry 4.0. The data that swirls around these facto­
ries, fleets, machines, equipment and products can be collected, aggregated, processed, 
analysed and ultimately monetised in a wide range of emerging scenarios. 
The upshot of all this is that the ability to design, develop, deploy and manage digital 
services – and do this with tremendous agility and at high levels of sophistication and 
scale – is going to be a critical capability for organisations that wish to become, or even 
remain, digital leaders within their industries. 
As we saw in Chapter 8, with digital business comes the expectation of intelligent, per­
sonalised and contextualised services that can be provided to customers, which are 
rapidly re-designed or enhanced as business needs dictate. In addition, the service 
itself may need to dynamically adjust based on the customer’s context, environmental 
parameters, business exceptions or other changing business conditions. 
According to Gartner’s predictions for IT organisations and users, 
By 2017, 70 percent of successful digital business models will rely on deliberately 
unstable processes designed to shift as customer needs shift.5
Since the processes are manifested via software, these software services will therefore 
need to be able to dynamically adjust according to customer needs.
So while the familiar SMAC technologies provide the foundational building blocks, 
together with emerging building blocks such as the IoT, there is also a need for innova­
tive service delivery techniques and approaches to keep pace with digital business. 
You can think of this as the ‘what’ and the ‘how’. Just as a magician has valuable props 
(the ‘what’) essential to his performance, he also needs to perfect his sleight of hand 
(the ‘how’). 
If you think about these innovative service delivery techniques essential for digital ser­
vice mastery, they break out into elements you need internally for IT efficiency and 
elements you need externally for the digital customer experience. In some cases, excel­
lence in one area helps to inform and improve the other. 
Taking a lifecycle perspective, in the digital services lifecycle, the idea is to accelerate 
digital service development and deployment, make services agile, scalable and avail­
able on demand, automate extensively, personalise and contextualise for the customer 
experience, and manage holistically.
Table 12.1 provides a listing of the essential innovative service delivery techniques and 
approaches that are required for digital services mastery and their corresponding ben­
efits to both IT and the business. These techniques start with agile development and

MASTERING DIGITAL BUSINESS
With this perspective in mind, here are six key questions to ask of your current digital 
initiatives to see where your organisation lies in terms of digital services mastery and 
what new techniques and approaches may be able to lend additional, even transforma­
tive, value: 
1.	
With an envisioned business model or process at hand, how quickly can 
you develop it via software? With today’s pace of innovation, time to market 
is critical. Techniques here include agile development and methodologies, 
and while this is not a new trend, it’s certainly gaining traction as a way 
to keep up with the volume of requests from the business and the need to 
deliver results rapidly and iteratively. As such, digital business provides the 
‘burning platform’ to make agile approaches more important now than ever. 
2.	
How quickly and reliably can you move digital services into production? 
The idea is to speed digital service deployment to place applications into 
production as rapidly as they’re developed. Techniques here include DevOps, 
for a faster and more reliable transition into production, and web-scale IT, 
for scalability. By way of definition, web-scale IT is an architectural approach, 
adopted from the practices of large cloud services providers, that emphasises 
design for resilience, scale and performance. Business-critical infrastructure 
is vital here as well. 
3.	
How responsive is your IT infrastructure to dynamically changing business 
conditions? The idea is to make services agile and flexible, with on-demand 
consumption and support for rapid changes to business rules. Techniques 
here include software-defined principles, including the concept of the SDDC, 
so that configuration changes can be applied via software as opposed to 
time-consuming manual tasks such as network and firewall configuration. 
4.	
How automated are your digital services? The idea is to reduce IT cost 
and complexity by reducing dependence on labour-based processes and 
optimising service efficiency. Techniques here include robotic process 
automation and machine learning. While physical robots and drones gain 
the majority of media attention, software robots are at present the unsung 
heroes and are already delivering significant results. 
5.	
How compelling is your digital customer experience? The idea here is 
clearly to delight and engage customers with compelling digital experiences 
so they become (or remain) loyal customers and you can gain a sustainable 
competitive advantage. Techniques include personalisation, context, analytics-
driven insights (into customer preferences, needs and interests), natural 
interfaces, user interface design, multi-channel support and much more.
6.	
How well can you manage your services and gain visibility into digital 
service performance? The idea is to simplify service management and to 
be able to manage holistically across all your digital channels. With ‘shadow 
IT’ on the rise, and with today’s hybrid IT environments, this is a far more 
difficult challenge than might be imagined. Techniques here include ITSM 
tools and approaches such as SIAM that help you to manage IT services, but 
also help you to manage higher-level business services as well, so that you 
can continually monitor the quality of your customer experience according 
to the business parameters that are important to them.

MASTERING THE DIGITAL SERVICES LIFECYCLE AND SPEEDING TIME TO MARKET
Progress in these six areas will help you to build your organisation’s mastery of the 
digital services lifecycle in terms of the digital touch points, interactions and transac­
tions with your customers. With this competency at hand, and with continual improve­
ment, your organisation will be well poised to compete in the digital world in the years 
to come. 
KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR CHAPTER 12
yy Mastery of digital services is going to become a key competency for 
organisations to grow their business and build sustainable competitive 
advantage in the years ahead. It’s no longer sufficient to have an innovative 
set of products or services; you have to be a master of how you design, 
develop, deploy, manage and continually evolve your digital services as well. 
yy So while the familiar SMAC technologies provide the foundational building 
blocks, together with emerging building blocks such as the IoT, there is also 
a need for innovative service delivery techniques and approaches to keep 
pace with digital business. 
yy You can think of this as the ‘what’ and the ‘how’. Just as a magician has 
valuable props (the ‘what’) essential to his performance, he also needs to 
perfect his sleight of hand (the ‘how’). 
yy Taking a lifecycle perspective, in the digital services lifecycle, the idea is 
to accelerate digital service development and deployment, make services 
agile, scalable and available on demand, automate extensively, personalise 
and contextualise for the customer experience, and manage holistically.
yy Innovative techniques and approaches for digital services mastery include 
agile, DevOps, as-a-service infrastructure, intelligent automation, personas 
and context, and digital service management.

PLATFORM
It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent that sur-
vives. It is the one that is the most adaptable to change. 

Adapted from Charles Darwin1
In terms of digital transformation initiatives, there’s often a lot of talk in terms of strat­
egy and less emphasis on practical execution. Everyone wants to advise the CEO and the 
board, but these discussions often only take the conversation so far. 
So how should an organisation think beyond the strategy and get to transformative 
execution and outcomes? It’s important to develop an approach that can span this divide 
between strategy and execution so that once the transformation objectives have been 
selected, there’s a clear path to a unified architectural approach and subsequent agile 
execution. 
In this chapter we’ll explore six steps for digital transformation that you can take to pro­
gress from innovative strategy development, to an architectural framework, to practical 
execution. The steps incorporate everything we’ve learned so far in this book across 
the major sections on planning, insight, action and roadmap. In the introduction, we 
saw how mastering digital business is a function of disruptive technologies, platform 
business models and digital services mastery – all accelerated by leading practices in 
corporate innovation: 
MASTERING DIGITAL BUSINESS = 
	
Function of (Disruptive Technologies + Platform Business Models + Digital 
Services Mastery)
	
Accelerated by (Leading Practices in Corporate Innovation)
What we’re saying here is that whatever your digital transformation objective, from a 
business perspective (i.e. ‘business-led, not technology-led’), you can get there by fol­
lowing this approach. Each of these elements can be a key enabler to help you achieve 
your target business outcomes and become a digital business leader. 
Now that we’re close to the end of our journey in this book, we can pull all this together 
to see how to execute the vision and roadmap. It all starts by identifying your transfor­
mation objectives. This may well be a combination of new business models (Chapter 1), 
150

THE AGILE JOURNEY TO THE NEW PLATFORM
new business processes (Chapter 2), or any of the more specific business objectives 
we explored across the digital customer experience (Chapter 8), the digital workplace 
(Chapter 9), insights from analytics (Chapter 10), and optimising digital infrastructure 
and simplifying management (Chapter 11). These chapters aimed to highlight the art 
of the possible and to provide some compelling examples from some of today’s digital 
business leaders. 
With your transformation objectives in mind, you can then proceed to employ the various 
technology enablers in the market (Chapter 3), assemble them into a suitable platform 
architecture and platform business model (Chapter 4), incorporate your mastery of the 
digital services lifecycle (Chapter 12), and accelerate your journey with leading practices 
in corporate innovation and a clear understanding of how to best to time your move 
(Chapters 5–7). 
Finally, you’ll execute the journey via a series of initiatives that will help you to simul­
taneously transform both the business and IT so that you can gain early benefits for 
customers and end users at the same time as IT transforms its own delivery model.
Table 13.1 provides a summary of the six steps for digital transformation, together with 
some of the key elements and considerations within each step.

MASTERING DIGITAL BUSINESS
So here are six steps for digital transformation, which should help to show how every­
thing comes together, and how you can progress from innovative strategy development, 
to an architectural framework, to practical execution.
Step 1 – Identify your transformation objectives 
Strategy and vision >> digital transformation strategy, digital transformation focus, 
investment
In terms of identifying your transformation objectives, this step corresponds to the 
strategy and vision aspect of your digital transformation journey. As you progress from 
strategy to execution, it’s important for the strategy to set the stake in the ground in 
terms of target business outcomes. Digital business is often discussed solely from the 
lens of the digital customer experience, but as we’ve seen, that’s only a part of the 
story – albeit a vital part. In addition to re-thinking and re-designing entire business 
models, the key desired transformation objectives often map to the following areas: 
yy Enhancing the digital customer and end-user experience to improve loyalty, 
revenues, productivity and retention.
yy Transforming business processes to reduce costs, improve productivity, 
integrate supply chain partners and differentiate offerings. 
yy Deriving insights from analytics to make better decisions, improve efficiencies 
and gain competitive advantage. 
yy Optimising infrastructure and operations to improve agility, flexibility and cost-
effectiveness. 
yy Simplifying management to reduce complexity, solve issues before they occur, 
and gain visibility and control over assets. 
Every organisation will have a slightly different set of transformational objectives, with 
different priorities, but this is a vital first step for organisational alignment. All this 
should help to inform and refine your overall strategy and vision in terms of your digital 
transformation strategy, digital transformation focus and investments. 
You can refer to the strategic options for business model innovation and the character­
istics of digital business processes described in Chapter 2 to help explore your strategic 
options and develop your strategy and vision. For example, we saw how business models 
can be re-designed to digitise products and services and to run or participate within indus­
try platforms by tapping into the sharing economy, reshaping value networks and creating 
new models for monetisation. We also saw how business processes can be re-designed to 
be experience-centric, automated, simplified, digitised, personalised, dynamic, real time, 
granular, aggregated and scalable to maximise their value propositions. 
Step 2 – Study technology enablers in the market
Technology and capabilities >> disruptive technology enablers
The next step is to be fully aware of, and leverage, the technology enablers in the market. 
This step, and the following two steps, correspond to the technology and capabilities 
aspects of your digital transformation journey. 
152

THE AGILE JOURNEY TO THE NEW PLATFORM
It’s important to look beyond the SMAC stack and into the next wave of enablers, includ­
ing personas and context, intelligent automation including human–machine collabora­
tion, the IoT and, of course, cyber security. As we’ve seen, advanced cyber security is a 
key enabler because when emerging technologies are not secure from the start, it cre­
ates delays in realising the technology’s full business benefits as organisations struggle 
to implement appropriate security controls. 
In addition to these more recent enablers, the core SMAC stack is clearly evolving as 
well. Mobility is evolving and embracing wearable technologies, and the cloud is evolv­
ing and embracing broader concepts such as hybrid IT and SDDCs. These key disrup­
tive technologies now serve as the foundational building blocks – some mature, some 
emerging – in the new digital business platform ecosystem of on-demand services. 
Taking a holistic view across all these enablers can help to maximise business benefits 
and unlock new forms of value in the years ahead.
You can refer to the examples and case studies provided in Chapter 3 to help understand 
the business value of each technology enabler and how it can be integrated into your 
overall approach. In addition, you can refer to the three waves of disruptive technol­
ogy adoption discussed in Chapter 7 to help you best exploit the position of each spe­
cific technology for business model transformation (emerging wave), high competitive 
advantage (differentiating wave) or proven business value (business value wave). 
Step 3 – Envision the future platform for digital business 
Technology and capabilities >> platform architectures and business models
In terms of technologies and capabilities, this step relates to how you assemble your 
foundational technology enablers to form digital business platform architectures as 
well as digital business platform business models. 
The new platform can be used as a frame of reference for digital business transforma­
tion in terms of the key IT capabilities – both technologies and approaches – needed to 
support your transformation objectives. In Chapter 3, we discussed six key characteris­
tics of the platform and how the model can help with your planning. 
Architecturally, the foundational technology enablers can be utilised to assemble 
a highly virtualised, highly distributed platform ecosystem of on-demand services. 
Based on your perspective, you’ll select powerful combinations of these technologies 
to achieve target business outcomes such as enhancing the digital customer experi­
ence, transforming the digital workplace, gaining insights from analytics, optimising 
infrastructure, simplifying management and implementing an adaptive cyber security 
defence posture. You can refer to Chapter 4 for several real-life examples of these tech­
nology combinations in action. 
Rather than a monolithic platform, the future platform will consist of an ecosystem of 
services from best-in-class providers. Foundational services will be selected based upon 
role-specific (for example, digital manager, application manager, infrastructure manager, 
IT operations manager) and outcome-oriented needs. Common groupings of pre-inte­
grated services will emerge, such as those provided by EDHs and SDDCs, so that you 
don’t have to do all the assembly yourself. 
153

MASTERING DIGITAL BUSINESS
In terms of practical execution, business managers can therefore select from this palette 
of options based on their specific needs. For example, by applying the ‘technology lever’ for 
the enhancing digital customer experience that we discussed in Chapter 8, we can deliver 
a new set of capabilities drawing from the ‘digital experience essentials’ as well as the 
‘digital experience enhancers’. More broadly, in the case of the digital customer experience, 
the full set of technology enablers can be envisioned, based on an understanding of the key 
attributes essential for a world-class experience as we outlined in the DCX Bill of Rights. 
In addition to considering the digital business platform architecture, it’s also vital to con­
sider the various platform business model opportunities we explored in Chapter 4. You 
can use the business strategy and IT strategy questions and considerations pertaining 
to platform business models outlined in the chapter to help plan your approach. At this 
step along the journey, envisioning the future platform should be as much about your 
future platform business model as it is about your future platform architecture, and the 
two operate hand in hand. 
Step 4 – Master the digital services lifecycle
Technology and capabilities >> digital services mastery
The next step for IT is to consider the ‘how’ as well as the ‘what’. It’s no longer sufficient 
to have an innovative set of products or services (the ‘what’); you have to be a master 
of how you design, develop, deploy, manage and continually evolve your digital services 
(the ‘how’) as well. Mastery of the digital services lifecycle is going to become a key 
competency for organisations to grow their business and build sustainable competitive 
advantage in the years ahead. 
All in all, there are six key approaches that are shaping how digital services are pro­
duced and consumed: agile, DevOps, as-a-service infrastructure, intelligent automation, 
personas and context, and, finally, digital service management. 
Collectively, these capabilities help to accelerate digital service development and 
deployment, make services available on demand, automate extensively, personalise to 
specific roles and manage holistically. Progress in these six areas will help you to build 
your organisation’s mastery of the digital services lifecycle in terms of the digital touch 
points, interactions and transactions with your customers. 
You can use the strategic questions posed in Chapter 12 to help assess your current 
digital initiatives to see where your organisation lies in terms of digital services mas­
tery and what new techniques and approaches may be able to lend additional, even 
transformative, value. By increasing your organisation’s maturity along each of these 
dimensions you’ll be able to continually and rapidly innovate your digital services based 
on customer and market demands. 
Step 5 – Organise for digital business innovation 
Process and governance >> innovation management, change management, governance
In terms of organising for digital business innovation, this step corresponds to the 
process and governance aspect of your digital transformation journey. Some of the key 
elements include innovation management, change management and governance. 
154

THE AGILE JOURNEY TO THE NEW PLATFORM
You can use the five critical pillars of innovation management capability outlined in 
Chapter 5 to help assess your current innovation programme and determine any gaps 
or improvements needed to ensure you have a robust innovation process that connects 
into all the appropriate corporate strategy, investment, and product and service devel­
opment processes. 
You can also use the information related to ongoing and event-based ideation presented 
in Chapter 6 to help ensure your organisation can maximise the innovation potential 
across your diverse ecosystem of employees, customers, suppliers and partners in a 
systematic manner and equally be able to mobilise ideation sessions as, where and 
when opportunities arise. Ongoing idea generation gives you a way to capture ideas 
from across the organisation whenever they arise, and event-based idea generation 
gives you a way to take a more targeted approach for specific audiences, goals and 
objectives, and key focus areas.
In terms of governance, one of the key changes here is that governance now needs to 
span both the slower-paced, incremental ‘business as usual’ initiatives as well as the 
faster-paced, more disruptive ‘transformation’ initiatives. This doesn’t mean that the 
type of governance and level of governance needs to be identical across both types of 
initiatives, but that the governance function will need to provide visibility across them 
both and will need to be more responsive and adaptive to the new pace of change and 
the frequent sprint cycles inherent in transformation initiatives. These initiatives will 
most likely be pursing agile and lean approaches to rapidly iterate around new prod­
ucts and services with frequent customer interaction and feedback. Governance pro­
grammes will therefore need to adjust some of their cadences related to reporting and 
metrics to strike the right balance between providing management insight and visibility, 
while ensuring a lightweight and flexible approach. 
In terms of change management, CIOs and business leaders don’t have to create entirely 
new processes, or reinvent the wheel, to execute on digital initiatives. In Chapter 5 we 
saw that you can use existing corporate funding and corporate innovation mechanisms, 
but will need to make five critical fine-tuning adjustments to readjust the sights squarely 
on digital business.
Step 6 – Execute an agile journey to the future platform 
People and culture >> leadership, culture, digital skills
In terms of executing on the journey to this new platform, this step corresponds to 
the people and culture aspect of your digital transformation journey. Some of the key 
elements include leadership, culture and digital skills. It takes all these elements to 
successfully make the transformation. 
It takes leadership to make innovation and digital transformation a necessity, to enforce 
behaviours, and to keep programmes chartered and aligned with the external perspec­
tive in mind. It takes culture to enable tolerance and receptivity to risk, and to embrace 
and empower change, and it takes digital skills to do the heavy lifting with a completely 
new set of tools and techniques. 
Whether it’s a focus on specific technology enablers such as robotics or the IoT, or a 
focus on specific techniques such as agile and DevOps, these skills will become more 
155

MASTERING DIGITAL BUSINESS
and more critical in the years ahead as organisations invest in scaling up their digi­
tal transformation initiatives. These organisations will look to IT professionals to pro­
vide compelling, differentiated solutions that enhance the digital customer experience, 
improve operations, and which can be designed and deployed in an agile manner. 
Finally, since business and IT strategy will determine and drive these future skill 
requirements, organisation-wide capabilities in strategic planning, innovation man­
agement, enterprise architecture, programme management and change management 
will also be essential to pull everything together and execute on the overall trans­
formation. IT professionals will be able to choose whether to go deep in terms of 
specialising in a specific technology or capability, or whether to go wide in terms of 
specialising in the broader perspective of how all these elements come together from 
a strategy and execution standpoint to enable the next generation of digital business 
solutions. 
Finally, when taking the journey to this new platform, it’s important to bear in mind that 
we live in a hybrid IT world. Organisations need to take the journey to the future plat­
form, while supporting and maintaining their existing applications and infrastructure. 
While some elements may be retired or modernised, other elements may need to co-
exist with, and be integrated into, the new platform. 
Since IT will be a hybrid environment for quite some time, it will be important to inter­
operate across these two divides. In addition, an agile and iterative journey to the future 
platform can simultaneously optimise infrastructure and simplify management on the 
back-end (the IT transformation) as well as improve the user experience and trans­
form business processes on the front-end (the business transformation). That way the 
business can gain early benefits for customers and end users at the same time as IT 
transforms its own delivery model. 
ASSESSING YOUR DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION MATURITY
Since the six steps for digital transformation incorporate all the requisite elements of 
strategy, people, process and technology, we can use them to develop a simple model 
to help assess where your organisation sits in terms of digital transformation maturity. 
Table 13.2 provides the model definitions so you can assess your maturity along each of 
the six dimensions. To keep the model straightforward, there are three maturity stages, 
ranging from ‘Early’ to ‘Developing’ to ‘Maturing’. In the Appendix, you can also find a set 
of assessment questions that you can take in order to gain a more formal assessment. 
You can apply many of the techniques and models presented in the book to help you 
move from a maturity level of ‘Early’ to ‘Developing’, or from ‘Developing’ to ‘Maturing’, 
along any of the six dimensions. For example, if you are currently at the ‘Developing’ 
stage in terms of your transformation objectives, you can refer to the various options 
for business model innovation and for business process re-design described in Step 1 
and also in-depth within Chapter 2. You can also advance your mastery of the digital 
customer experience by referring to the models and case studies in Chapter 8.
As another example, if you are currently at the ‘Early’ stage in terms of the capabili­
ties of your corporate innovation programme, you can refer to the five critical pillars 
156

THE AGILE JOURNEY TO THE NEW PLATFORM
of innovation management capability described in Chapter 5 as well as the details on 
event-based and ongoing ideation – including innovation workshops – described in 
Chapter 6. Likewise, if you are currently at the ‘Early’ or ‘Developing’ stage in terms of 
your digital services mastery, you can refer to the full set of six key capabilities described 
in Chapter 12, namely agile, DevOps, as-a-service infrastructure, intelligent automation, 
personas and context, and digital service management.

MASTERING DIGITAL BUSINESS
Digital transformation is clearly a journey, not a destination, so even once you reach 
maturity across all dimensions, there will be a need for continuous innovation and for 
continuous and rapid response to change, and to challenges and opportunities as they 
arise. One of the benefits of moving along the maturity curve is that you can essentially 
incorporate next-generation skills and capabilities so that agility becomes an intrinsic 
part of the organisation’s operating model. For example:
yy Digitally re-designed business processes have a number of characteristics 
that enable them to trump traditional processes by being experience-centric, 
automated, simplified, digitised, personalised, dynamic, real time, granular, 
aggregated and scalable.
yy Platform business models enable rapid growth and changes to the ecosystem, 
since they rely on external producers and consumers to provide the actual – 
physical or digital – products, services and social currency, so they can scale up 
and achieve critical mass very quickly.
yy Technologies, tools and techniques such as cloud management, EDHs, SDDCs, 
micro-segmentation and digital service management make IT infrastructure 
highly agile and cost-effective.
yy Techniques such as agile and DevOps enable organisations to iterate rapidly 
in terms of experimenting with new features, or even entirely new service 
offerings, and quickly place applications into production once they’re developed.
yy The overall concept of digital service mastery helps to accelerate digital service 
development and deployment, makes services agile, scalable and available 
on demand, automates extensively, personalises and contextualises for the 
customer experience, and enables them to be managed holistically.
yy Innovation programmes that are highly adapted and fine-tuned to support digital 
transformation initiatives and can embrace the same operating principles – that 
is, lean, agile, flexible, efficient and more – so they can be executed at speed 
and at scale.
In the Conclusion, we’ll address the digital transformation journey in more detail and 
discuss what lies ahead for digital transformation as it evolves and becomes ever-more 
impactful on our lives, our businesses and our societies.

Now this is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the 
end of the beginning.

Winston Churchill (1942)1
Now that we’re at the close of our journey to mastering digital business, I hope that the 
discussion of disruptive technologies, platform business models, digital services mas­
tery and innovation management approaches has helped to shed some light into the 
practices of today’s digital business leaders and provide a glimpse of what’s to come in 
the future, along with some strategic considerations, techniques and approaches that 
you can apply within your own initiatives. 
Digital transformation is a broad subject that requires competency across strategy and 
vision, people and culture, processes and governance, as well as technology and capa­
bilities as shown in Figure C.1. 
Figure C.1  Key pillars of digital transformation
Figure 
C.1
The most successful digital transformation initiatives pay attention to all these areas so 
that the six steps to digital transformation that we discussed earlier in Chapter 13 can 
move the organisation seamlessly from strategy to execution. As we saw in our case 
160

CONCLUSION
study about the Mercedes AMG Petronas Formula One Team, a world-leading position 
doesn’t necessarily require world-leading performance in every single domain. It’s more 
a case of being a world leader and innovator in the key areas that matter, and being a 
fast follower in the rest. 
It’s my hope this book provides some key insights and advice, as well as motivation, 
for you to achieve a world-leading position for your organisation, particularly in terms 
of strategy, innovation, and emerging technologies and capabilities as they pertain to 
digital transformation. By coupling this with insights from other sources into the ‘soft 
skills’ related to leadership, culture, governance and change management, you’ll have 
a powerful combination for success. 
So, what lies ahead for digital transformation? 
We can be certain that one of the only constants will be change. We can expect change to 
occur across all the key pillars of digital transformation that we’ve discussed here: from 
strategy, to people, process and technology. These may seem like traditional pillars, but 
there’s nothing traditional about them. As we’ve seen, each pillar involves vastly new 
approaches when compared to business as usual. 
In terms of industry shifts, according to the Global Center for Digital Business 
Transformation, 40 per cent of companies are at risk of being displaced because they’re 
not equipped for the digital future.2 I expect we’ll continue to see accelerating topple-
rates among the Fortune 500 and the FTSE 250, as well as corresponding shifts in 
industry leaders. We may also see greater separation between digital leaders and lag­
gards – driven by how well they can deliver upon the digital customer experience – as 
well as more partnerships between industry players and high-tech players as they join 
forces to create superior offerings and value propositions. These partnerships will be 
powered by platform- and ecosystem-oriented business models. This will likely gener­
ate some of the highest magnitude business disruptions in the years ahead, as platform 
business models dissolve industry boundaries and hyper-extend the limits of the cus­
tomer journey from one industry to another. 
While SMAC will likely remain the core foundational set of technologies for digital busi­
ness, we’ll see a large number of new technology enablers continue to come into focus 
as value enhancers within digital business models and processes. The use of the IoT 
as well as intelligent automation will be megatrends that empower and expand digital 
business scenarios in the years ahead, as well as raising many issues and challenges 
along the way in terms of privacy, safety and security. 
We’ll see a digital workplace that combines the best of what humans and machines 
have to offer in the form of new human–machine work scenarios. Rather than harsh 
boundaries between humans and machines, we’ll see a converged future where work 
processes are optimised in two converging directions: instrumentation of human pro­
cesses and socialisation of machine processes, so the two can work in greater harmony 
together. Machines will continue to get more social and humans will continue to get 
more instrumented, all of which will amplify the possibilities.
Much as sleight of hand differentiates magicians who may be using the same props 
as part of their performance, digital services mastery will become a key point of 
161

MASTERING DIGITAL BUSINESS
differentiation for organisations by helping them to innovate their services more rapidly 
than their competitors and uniquely tailor them for each customer. 
We can expect the discipline of innovation management to evolve further as well. In 
the book, we discussed how innovation needs to go beyond the table-stakes of idea 
management and provide a complete programme addressing not only the innovation 
pipeline, but the front-end of the innovation lifecycle in terms of ‘where to play’ and the 
back-end of the lifecycle in terms of ‘how to scale’. Technologies such as robotic market 
intelligence will help managers to keep better tabs on emerging market trends and 
technologies, and simulation techniques and algorithms will help managers run ‘what-
if’ scenarios for their world-building, digital futures. 
At a turning point in the war, in November 1942, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill 
stated that 
Now this is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, 
the end of the beginning. 
This sentiment could not be more true for digital transformation. We’re at the beginning 
of an exciting journey that will take us into the next ten years and beyond. While the term 
‘digital transformation’ may change, you can be sure it will continue to be both ‘digital’ 
and a ‘transformation.

APPENDIX
DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION MATURITY 
ASSESSMENT
The following set of assessment questions are intended to help you assess your organi­
sation’s current digital transformation maturity along each of the six dimensions that 
we outlined in Chapter 13, ‘The agile journey to the new platform’. Please refer to this 
chapter for further information about the model. In terms of assessing and respond­
ing to your maturity level in each dimension, please see the section below entitled
