The plane of Euclidean geom-
etry is today often described as the
set of all coordinate pairs (x, y),
where x and y are real. We could
instead imagine the plane F that
is deﬁned in the same way, but
with x and y taken from the set
of hyperreal numbers. As a third
alternative, there is the plane G
in which the ﬁnite hyperreals are
used. In E, Euclid’s parallel postu-
late holds: given a line and a point
not on the line, there exists ex-
actly one line passing through the
point that does not intersect the
line.
Does the parallel postulate
hold in F? In G? Is it valid to as-
sociate only E with the plane de-
scribed by Euclid’s axioms?

CHAPTER 2. TO INFINITY — AND BEYOND!

3 Integration
3.1 Deﬁnite and
indeﬁnite
integrals
Because any formula can be diﬀer-
entiated symbolically to ﬁnd an-
other formula, the main motiva-
tion for doing derivatives numeri-
cally would be if the function to
be diﬀerentiated wasn’t known in
symbolic form.
A typical exam-
ple might be a two-person network
computer game, in which player
A’s computer needs to ﬁgure out
player B’s velocity based on knowl-
edge of how her position changes
over time. But in most cases, it’s
numerical integration that’s inter-
esting, not numerical diﬀerentia-
tion.
As a warm-up, let’s see how to
do a running sum of a discrete
function using Yacas. The follow-
ing program computers the sum
1+2+. . .+100 discussed to on page
9.
Now that we’re writing real
computer programs with Yacas, it
would be a good idea to enter each
program into a ﬁle before trying to
run it. In fact, some of these exam-
ples won’t run properly if you just
start up Yacas and type them in
one line at a time. If you’re using
Adobe Reader to read this book,
you can do Tools>Basic>Select,
select the program, copy it into a
ﬁle, and then edit out the line num-
bers.
Example 30
1
n := 1;
2
sum := 0;
3
While (n<=100) [
4
sum := sum+n;
5
n := n+1;
6
];
7
Echo(sum);
The semicolons are to separate one
instruction from the next, and they
become necessary now that we’re
doing real programming.
Line 1
of this program deﬁnes the vari-
able n, which will take on all the
values from 1 to 100. Line 2 says
that we haven’t added anything up
yet, so our running sum is zero do
far.
Line 3 says to keep on re-
peating the instructions inside the
square brackets until n goes past
100.
Line 4 updates the running
sum, and line 5 updates the value
of n. If you’ve never done any pro-
gramming before, a statement like
n:=n+1 might seem like nonsense
— how can a number equal itself
plus one? But that’s why we use
the := symbol; it says that we’re
redeﬁning n, not stating an equa-
tion. If n was previously 37, then
after this statement is executed, n
will be redeﬁned as 38. To run the
program on a Linux computer, do
this (assuming you saved the pro-
gram in a ﬁle named sum.yacas):
% yacas -pc sum.yacas

CHAPTER 3. INTEGRATION

Here the % symbol is the com-
puter’s prompt.
The result is
5,050, as expected.
One way of
stating this result is
100
X
n=1
n = 5050
.
The capital Greek letter Σ, sigma,
is used because it makes the “s”
sound, and that’s the ﬁrst sound in
the word “sum.” The n = 1 below
the sigma says the sum starts at 1,
and the 100 on top says it ends at
100. The n is what’s known as a
dummy variable: it has no mean-
ing outside the context of the sum.
Figure a shows the graphical inter-
pretation of the sum: we’re adding
up the areas of a series of rectan-
gular strips. (For clarity, the ﬁgure
only shows the sum going up to 7,
rather than 100.)

Now how about an integral? Fig-
ure b shows the graphical inter-
pretation of what we’re trying to
do:
ﬁnd the area of the shaded
triangle.
This is an example we
know how to do symbolically, so
we can do it numerically as well,
and check the answers against each
other.
Symbolically, the area is
given by the integral.
To inte-
grate the function ˙x(t) = t, we
know we need some function with
a t2 in it, since we want something
whose derivative is t, and diﬀeren-
tiation reduces the power by one.
The derivative of t2 would be 2t
rather than t, so what we want is
x(t) = t2/2.
Let’s compute the
area of the triangle that stretches
along the t axis from 0 to 100:
x(100) = 100/2 = 5000.
b / Graphical
interpreta-
tion of the integral of the
function ˙x(t) = t.
Figure c shows how to accomplish
the same thing numerically.
We
break up the area into a whole
bunch of very skinny rectangles.
Ideally, we’d like to make the width
of each rectangle be an inﬁnitesi-
mal number dx, so that we’d be

3.1. DEFINITE AND INDEFINITE INTEGRALS
53
adding up an inﬁnite number of in-
ﬁnitesimal areas. In reality, a com-
puter can’t do that, so we divide up
the interval from t = 0 to t = 100
into H rectangles, each with ﬁ-
nite width dt = 100/H.
Instead
of making H inﬁnite, we make it
the largest number we can without
making the computer take too long
to add up the areas of the rectan-
gles.
c / Approximating the in-
tegral numerically.
Example 31
1
tmax := 100;
2
H := 1000;
3
dt := tmax/H;
4
sum := 0;
5
t := 0;
6
While (t<=tmax) [
7
sum := N(sum+t*dt);
8
t := N(t+dt);
9
];
10
Echo(sum);
In example 31, we split the in-
terval from t = 0 to 100 into
H = 1000 small intervals, each
with width dt = 0.1. The result is
5,005, which agrees with the sym-
bolic result to three digits of preci-
sion. Changing H to 10,000 gives
5, 000.5, which is one more digit.
Clearly as we make the number
of rectangles greater and greater,
we’re converging to the correct re-
sult of 5,000.
In the Leibniz notation, the thing
we’ve just calculated, by two diﬀer-
ent techniques, is written like this:
Z 100
0
t dt = 5, 000
It looks a lot like the Σ notation,
with the Σ replaces by a ﬂattened-
out letter “S.” The t is a dummy
variable. What I’ve been casually
referring to as an integral is re-
ally two diﬀerent but closely re-
lated things, known as the deﬁnite
integral and the indeﬁnite integral.
Deﬁnition of the indeﬁnite integral
If ˙x is a function, then a function
x is an indeﬁnite integral of ˙x if, as
implied by the notation, dx/dt =
˙x.
Interpretation:
Doing an indeﬁ-
nite integral means doing the op-
posite of diﬀerentiation.
All the
possible indeﬁnite integrals are the
same function except for an addi-
tive constant.
Example 32
▷Find the indeﬁnite integral of the
function ˙x(t) = t.
▷Any function of the form
x(t) = t2/2 + c
,

54
CHAPTER 3. INTEGRATION
where c is a constant, is an indeﬁ-
nite integral of this function, since its
derivative is t.
Deﬁnition of the deﬁnite integral
If ˙x is a function, then the deﬁnite
integral of ˙x from a to b is deﬁned
as
Z b
a
˙x(t)dt
= lim
H→∞
H
X
i=0
˙x (a + i∆t)
,
where ∆t = (b −a)/H.
Interpretation: What we’re calcu-
lating is the area under the graph
of ˙x, from a to b.
(If the graph
dips below the t axis, we interpret
the area between it and the axis as
a negative area.) The thing inside
the limit is a calculation like the
one done in example 31, but gen-
eralized to a ̸= 0. If H was inﬁnite,
then ∆t would be an inﬁnitesimal
number dt.
3.2 The fundamental
theorem of
calculus
The fundamental theorem of calcu-
lus
Let x be an indeﬁnite integral of
˙x, and let ˙x be a continuous func-
tion (one whose graph is a single
connected curve). Then
Z b
a
˙x(t)dt = x(b) −x(a)
.
Interpretation: In the simple ex-
amples we’ve been doing so far, we
were able to choose an indeﬁnite
integral such that x(0) = 0.
In
that case, x(t) is interpreted as the
area from 0 to t, so in the expres-
sion x(b) −x(a), we’re taking the
area from 0 to a, but subtracting
out the area from 0 to b, which
gives the area from a to b. If we
choose an indeﬁnite integral with
a diﬀerent c, the c’s will just can-
cel out anyway in the diﬀerence
x(b) −x(a).
The
fundamental
theorem
is
proved on page 107.

graphically; then evaluate it it both
symbolically
and
numerically,
and
check that the two results are consis-
tent.
▷Figure d shows the graphical inter-
pretation.
The numerical calculation
requires a trivial variation on the pro-
gram from example 31:
a := 1;
b := 2;
H := 1000;
dt := (b-a)/H;

3.3. PROPERTIES OF THE INTEGRAL

sum := 0;
t := a;
While (t<=b) [
sum := N(sum+(1/t)*dt);
t := N(t+dt);
];
Echo(sum);
The
result
is
0.693897243,
and
increasing
H
to
10,000
gives
0.6932221811,
so
we
can
be
fairly conﬁdent that the result equals
0.693, to 3 decimal places.
Symbolically, the indeﬁnite integral is
x = ln t. Using the fundamental the-
orem of calculus, the area is ln 2 −
ln 1 ≈0.693147180559945.
Judging from the graph, it looks plau-
sible that the shaded area is about
0.7.
This is an interesting example, be-
cause the natural log blows up to neg-
ative inﬁnity as t approaches 0, so it’s
not possible to add a constant onto
the indeﬁnite integral and force it to be
equal to 0 at t = 0. Nevertheless, the
fundamental theorem of calculus still
works.
3.3 Properties of the
integral
Let f and g be two functions of x,
and let c be a constant. We already
know that for derivatives,
d
dx(f + g) = df
dx + dg
dx
and
d
dx(cf) = cdf
dx
.
But since the indeﬁnite integral is
just the operation of undoing a
derivative, the same kind of rules
must hold true for indeﬁnite inte-
grals as well:
Z
(f + g)dx =
Z
fdx +
Z
gdx
and
Z
(cf)dx = c
Z
fdx
.
And since a deﬁnite integral can be
found by plugging in the upper and
lower limits of integration into the
indeﬁnite integral, the same prop-
erties must be true of deﬁnite inte-
grals as well.
Example 34
▷Evaluate the indeﬁnite integral
Z
(x + 2 sin x)dx
.
▷Using the additive property, the inte-
gral becomes
Z
xdx +
Z
2 sin xdx
.

56
CHAPTER 3. INTEGRATION
Then the property of scaling by a con-
stant lets us change this to
Z
xdx + 2
Z
sin xdx
.
We need a function whose derivative
is x, which would be x2/2, and one
whose derivative is sin x, which must
be −cos x, so the result is
1
2x2 −2 cos x + c
.
3.4 Applications
Averages
In the story of Gauss’s problem of
adding up the numbers from 1 to
100, one interpretation of the re-
sult, 5,050, is that the average of
all the numbers from 1 to 100 is
50.5. This is the ordinary deﬁni-
tion of an average: add up all the
things you have, and divide by the
number of things. (The result in
this example makes sense, because
half the numbers are from 1 to 50,
and half are from 51 to 100, so the
average is half-way between 50 and
51.)
Similarly, a deﬁnite integral can
also be thought of as a kind of aver-
age. In general, if y is a function of
x, then the average, or mean, value
of y on the interval from x = a to
b can be deﬁned as
¯y =
1
b −a
Z b
a
y dx
.
In the continuous case, dividing by
b −a accomplishes the same thing
as dividing by the number of things
in the discrete case.
Example 35
▷Show that the deﬁnition of the aver-
age makes sense in the case where
the function is a constant.
▷If y is a constant, then we can take
it outside of the integral, so
¯y =

The mean value theorem
If the continuous function y(x) has
the average value ¯y on the inter-
val from x = a to b, then y at-
tains its average value at least once
in that interval, i.e., there exists ξ
with a < ξ < b such that y(ξ) = ¯y.
The mean value theorem is proved
on page 108.

3.4. APPLICATIONS
57
Example 37
▷Verify the mean value theorem for
y = x2 on the interval from 0 to 1.
▷The mean value is 1/3, as shown in
example 36.
This value is achieved
at x =

1/3 = 1/
√
3, which lies be-
tween 0 and 1.
Work
In physics, work is a measure of
the amount of energy transferred
by a force; for example, if a horse
sets a wagon in motion, the horse’s
force on the wagon is putting some
energy of motion into the wagon.
When a force F acts on an ob-
ject that moves in the direction of
the force by an inﬁnitesimal dis-
tance dx, the inﬁnitesimal work
done is dW = Fdx.
Integrating
both sides, we have W =
R b
a Fdx,
where the force may depend on x,
and a and b represent the initial
and ﬁnal positions of the object.
Example 38
▷A spring compressed by an amount
x relative to its relaxed length provides
a force F = kx. Find the amount of
work that must be done in order to
compress the spring from x = 0 to
x = a. (This is the amount of energy
stored in the spring, and that energy
will later be released into the toy bul-
let.)

The reason W grows like a2, not just
like a, is that as the spring is com-
pressed more, more and more effort
is required in order to compress it.
Probability
Mathematically,
the
probability
that something will happen can be
speciﬁed with a number ranging
from 0 to 1, with 0 representing im-
possibility and 1 representing cer-
tainty. If you ﬂip a coin, heads and
tails both have probabilities of 1/2.
The sum of the probabilities of all
the possible outcomes has to have
probability 1. This is called nor-
malization.
e / Normalization:
the
probability
of
picking
land plus the probability
of picking water adds up
to 1.
So far we’ve discussed random pro-
cesses having only two possible

58
CHAPTER 3. INTEGRATION
outcomes: yes or no, win or lose,
on or oﬀ. More generally, a ran-
dom process could have a result
that is a number. Some processes
yield integers, as when you roll a
die and get a result from one to
six, but some are not restricted to
whole numbers, e.g., the height of
a human being, or the amount of
time that a uranium-238 atom will
exist before undergoing radioactive
decay. The key to handling these
continuous random variables is the
concept of the area under a curve,
i.e., an integral.
f / Probability distribution for the result
of rolling a single die.
Consider a throw of a die. If the die
is “honest,” then we expect all six
values to be equally likely. Since all
six probabilities must add up to 1,
then probability of any particular
value coming up must be 1/6. We
can summarize this in a graph, f.
Areas under the curve can be inter-
preted as total probabilities.
For
instance, the area under the curve
from 1 to 3 is 1/6+1/6+1/6 = 1/2,
so the probability of getting a re-
sult from 1 to 3 is 1/2. The func-
tion shown on the graph is called
the probability distribution.
g / Rolling two dice and adding them
up.
Figure g shows the probabilities of
various results obtained by rolling
two dice and adding them to-
gether, as in the game of craps.
The probabilities are not all the
same. There is a small probability
of getting a two, for example, be-
cause there is only one way to do it,
by rolling a one and then another
one.
The probability of rolling a
seven is high because there are six
diﬀerent ways to do it: 1+6, 2+5,
etc.
If the number of possible outcomes
is large but ﬁnite, for example the
number of hairs on a dog, the
graph would start to look like a
smooth curve rather than a ziggu-
rat.

3.4. APPLICATIONS
59
What about probability distribu-
tions for random numbers that are
not integers?
We can no longer
make a graph with probability on
the y axis, because the probabil-
ity of getting a given exact num-
ber is typically zero. For instance,
there is zero probability that a per-
son will be exactly 200 cm tall,
since there are inﬁnitely many pos-
sible results that are close to 200
but not exactly two, for exam-
ple 199.99999999687687658766. It
doesn’t usually make sense, there-
fore, to talk about the probability
of a single numerical result, but it
does make sense to talk about the
probability of a certain range of re-
sults. For instance, the probability
that a randomly chosen person will
be more than 170 cm and less than
200 cm in height is a perfectly rea-
sonable thing to discuss. We can
still summarize the probability in-
formation on a graph, and we can
still interpret areas under the curve
as probabilities.
h / A probability distribution for human
height.
But the y axis can no longer be a
unitless probability scale.
In the
example of human height, we want
the x axis to have units of meters,
and we want areas under the curve
to be unitless probabilities.
The
area of a single square on the graph
paper is then
(unitless area of a square)
= (width of square
with distance units)
×(height of square)
.
If the units are to cancel out, then
the height of the square must ev-
idently be a quantity with units
of inverse centimeters.
In other
words, the y axis of the graph is
to be interpreted as probability per
unit height, not probability.
Another way of looking at it is that
the y axis on the graph gives a
derivative, dP/dx:
the inﬁnites-
imally small probability that x
will lie in the inﬁnitesimally small
range covered by dx.
Example 39
▷A computer language will typically
have a built-in subroutine that pro-
duces a fairly random number that
is equally likely to take on any value
in the range from 0 to 1.
If you
take the absolute value of the differ-
ence between two such numbers, the
probability distribution is of the form
dP/dx = k(1 −x). Find the value of
the constant k that is required by nor-
malization.

i / The average can be interpreted as
the balance point of the probability dis-

When one random variable is re-

matical way, the chain rule can be
used to relate their probability dis-

Example 40
▷A laser is placed one meter away
from a wall, and spun on the ground
to give it a random direction, but if
the angle u shown in ﬁgure j doesn’t
come out in the range from 0 to π/2,
the laser is spun again until an an-
gle in the desired range is obtained.
Find the probability distribution of the
distance x shown in the ﬁgure. The
derivative d tan−1 z/dz = 1/(1+z2) will
be required (see example 49, page
72).
▷Since any angle between 0 and π/2
is equally likely, the probability distri-
bution dP/du must be a constant, and
normalization tells us that the constant
must be dP/du = 2/π.
The laser is one meter from the wall,
so the distance x, measured in me-
ters, is given by x = tan u.
For the

Note that the range of possible values
of x theoretically extends from 0 to in-
ﬁnity. Problem 6 on page 92 deals with
this.
If the next Martian you meet asks
you, “How tall is an adult hu-
man?,” you will probably reply
with a statement about the average
human height, such as “Oh, about
5 feet 6 inches.” If you wanted to
explain a little more, you could say,
“But that’s only an average. Most
people are somewhere between 5
feet and 6 feet tall.”
Without
bothering to draw the relevant bell
curve for your new extraterrestrial
acquaintance, you’ve summarized
the relevant information by giving
an average and a typical range of
variation. The average of a prob-
ability distribution can be deﬁned
geometrically as the horizontal po-
sition at which it could be balanced
if it was constructed out of card-
board, i.
This is a diﬀerent way
of working with averages than the
one we did earlier.
Before, had
a graph of y versus x, we implic-
itly assumed that all values of x
were equally likely, and we found
an average value of y. In this new
method using probability distribu-
tions, the variable we’re averaging
is on the x axis, and the y axis tells
us the relative probabilities of the
various x values.
For a discrete-valued variable with

values,
the

would be

and in the case of a continuous

Sometimes we don’t just want to
know the average value of a cer-

some idea of the amount of varia-

ing this is the standard deviation,
deﬁned by

The idea here is that if there was

dP/dx was nonzero, and the stan-

4 Techniques
4.1 Newton’s method
In the 1958 science ﬁction novel
Have
Space
Suit
—
Will
Travel, by Robert Heinlein, Kip
is a high school student who wants
to be an engineer, and his father is
trying to convince him to stretch
himself more if he wants to get any-
thing out of his education:
“Why did Van Buren fail of re-
election? How do you extract the
cube root of eighty-seven?”
Van Buren had been a president;
that was all I remembered. But I
could answer the other one.
“If
you want a cube root, you look in
a table in the back of the book.”
Dad sighed.
“Kip, do you think
that table was brought down from
on high by an archangel?”
We no longer use tables to com-
pute roots, but how does a pocket
calculator do it?
A technique
called Newton’s method allows us
to calculate the inverse of any func-
tion eﬃciently, including cases that
aren’t preprogrammed into a cal-
culator. In the example from the
novel, we know how to calculate
the function y = x3 fairly accu-
rately and quickly for any given
value of x, but we want to turn the
equation around and ﬁnd x when
y = 87.
We start with a rough
mental guess: since 43 = 64 is a lit-
tle too small, and 53 = 125 is much
too big, we guess x ≈4.3. Test-
ing our guess, we have 4.33 = 79.5.
We want y to get bigger by 7.5, and
we can use calculus to ﬁnd approx-
imately how much bigger x needs
to get in order to accomplish that:
∆x = ∆x
∆y ∆y
≈dx
dy ∆y
=
∆y
dy/dx
= ∆y
3x2
= ∆y
3x2
= 0.14
Increasing our value of x to 4.3 +
0.14 = 4.44, we ﬁnd that 4.443 =
87.5 is a pretty good approxima-
tion to 87. If we need higher preci-
sion, we can go through the process
again with ∆y = −0.5, giving
∆x ≈∆y
3x2
= 0.14
x = 4.43
x3 = 86.9
.
This second iteration gives an ex-
cellent approximation.

hannes Kepler’s analysis of the motion

of the planets. The ellipse is the or-
bit of the planet around the sun. At
t = 0, the planet is at its closest ap-
proach to the sun, A. At some later
time, the planet is at point B. The an-
gle x (measured in radians) is deﬁned
with reference to the imaginary circle
encompassing the orbit. Kepler found
the equation
2π t
T = x −e sin x
,
where the period, T, is the time re-
quired for the planet to complete a full
orbit, and the eccentricity of the el-
lipse, e, is a number that measures
how much it differs from a circle. The
relationship is complicated because
the planet speeds up as it falls inward
toward the sun, and slows down again
as it swings back away from it.
The planet Mercury has e = 0.206.
Find the angle x when Mercury has
completed 1/4 of a period.
▷We have
y = x −(0.206) sin x
,
and we want to ﬁnd x when y
=
2π/4 = 1.57. As a ﬁrst guess, we try
x = π/2 (90 degrees), since the ec-
centricity of Mercury’s orbit is actually
much smaller than the example shown
in the ﬁgure, and therefore the planet’s
speed doesn’t vary all that much as it
goes around the sun. For this value of
x we have y = 1.36, which is too small
by 0.21.
∆x ≈
∆y
dy/dx
=
0.21
1 −(0.206) cos x
= 0.21
(The derivative dy/dx happens to be
1 at x = π/2.) This gives a new value
of x, 1.57+.21=1.78.
Testing it, we
have y = 1.58, which is correct to
within rounding errors after only one
iteration. (We were only supplied with
a value of e accurate to three signiﬁ-
cant ﬁgures, so we can’t get a result
with precision better than about that
level.)
4.2 Implicit
differentiation
We can diﬀerentiate any function
that is written as a formula, and
ﬁnd a result in terms of a formula.
However, sometimes the original
problem can’t be written in any
nice way as a formula. For exam-
ple, suppose we want to ﬁnd dy/dx
in a case where the relationship be-
tween x and y is given by the fol-
lowing equation:
y7 + y = x7 + x2
.

4.3. TAYLOR SERIES
67
There
is
no
equivalent
of
the
quadratic
formula
for
seventh-
order polynomials, so we have no
way to solve for one variable in
terms of the other in order to dif-
ferentiate it. However, we can still
ﬁnd dy/dx in terms of x and y.
Suppose we let x grow to x + dx.
Then for example the x2 term will
grow to (x+dx)2 = x+2dx+dx2.
The squared inﬁnitesimal is negli-
gible, so the increase in x2 was re-
ally just 2dx, and we’ve really just
computer the derivative of x2 with
respect to x and multiplied it by
dx. In symbols,
d(x2) = d(x2)
dx
· dx
= 2x dx
.
That is, the change in x2 is 2x
times the change in x. Doing this
to both sides of the original equa-
tion, we have
d(y7 + y) = d(x7 + x2)
7y6 dy + 1 dy = 7x6 dx + 2x dx
(7y6 + 1)dy = (7x6 + 2x)dx
dy
dx = 7y6 + 1
7x6 + 2x
.
This still doesn’t give us a for-
mula for the derivative in terms of
x alone, but it’s not entirely use-
less.
For instance, if we’re given
a numerical value of x, we can al-
ways use Newton’s method to ﬁnd
y, and then evaluate the derivative.
4.3 Taylor series
If you calculate e0.1 on your calcu-
lator, you’ll ﬁnd that it’s very close
to 1.1. This is because the tangent
line at x = 0 on the graph of ex
has a slope of 1 (dex/dx = ex = 1
at x = 0), and the tangent line is
a good approximation to the expo-
nential curve as long as we don’t
get too far away from the point of
tangency.
b / The function ex, and
the tangent line at x = 0.
How
big
is
the
error?
The
actual
value
of
e0.1
is
1.10517091807565 . . .,
which
diﬀers from 1.1 by about 0.005.
If we go farther from the point
of tangency,
the approximation
gets worse. At x = 0.2, the error
is about 0.021, which is about
four times bigger. In other words,
doubling
x
seems
to
roughly
quadruple the error, so the error
is proportional to x2; it seems to
be about x2/2.
Well, if we want
a
handy-dandy,
super-accurate
estimate of ex for small values of
x, why not just account for this
error.
Our new and improved

68
CHAPTER 4. TECHNIQUES
estimate is
ex ≈1 + x + 1
2x2
for small values of x.
c / The function ex, and
the approximation 1 + x +
x2/2.
Figure c shows that the approxi-
mation is now extremely good for
suﬃciently small values of x. The
diﬀerence is that whereas 1 + x
matched both the y-intercept and
the slope of the curve, 1+x+x2/2
matches the curvature as well. Re-
call that the second derivative is a
measure of curvature. The second
derivatives of the function and its
approximation are

We can do even better. Suppose
we want to match the third deriva-
tives.
All the derivatives of ex,
evaluated at x = 0, are 1, so we
d / The function ex, and
the approximation 1 + x +
x2/2 + x3/6.
just need to add on a term pro-
portional to x3 whose third deriva-
tive is one. Taking the ﬁrst deriva-
tive will bring down a factor of 3
in front, and taking and the sec-
ond derivative will give a 2, so to
cancel these out we need the third-
order term to be (1/2)(1/3):
ex ≈1 + x + 1
2x2 +
1
2 · 3x3
Figure d shows the result. For a
signiﬁcant range of x values close
to zero, the approximation is now
so good that we can’t even see the
diﬀerence between the two func-
tions on the graph.
On the other hand, ﬁgure e shows
that the cubic approximation for
somewhat larger negative and pos-
itive values of x is poor — worse,
in fact, than the linear approxi-
mation, or even the constant ap-
proximation ex = 1.
This is to
be expected, because any polyno-
mial will blow up to either posi-
tive or negative inﬁnity as x ap-
proaches negative inﬁnity, whereas

4.3. TAYLOR SERIES
69
the function ex is supposed to get
very close to zero for large negative
x. The idea here is that derivatives
are local things: they only measure
the properties of a function very
close to the point at which they’re
evaluated, and they don’t necessar-
ily tell us anything about points far
away.
e / The function ex, and the approxi-
mation 1 + x + x2/2 + x3/6, on a wider
scale.
It’s a remarkable fact, then, that
by taking enough terms in a poly-
nomial approximation, we can al-
ways get as good an approximation
to ex as necessary — it’s just that
a large number of terms may be
required for large values of x. In
other words, the inﬁnite series
1 + x + 1
2x2 +
1
2 · 3x3 + . . .
always gives exactly ex. But what
is the pattern here that would al-
lows us to ﬁgure out, say, the
fourth-order and ﬁfth-order terms
that were swept under the rug
with the symbol “. . . ”?
Let’s do
the ﬁfth-order term as an example.
The point of adding in a ﬁfth-order
term is to make the ﬁfth derivative
of the approximation equal to the
ﬁfth derivative of ex, which is 1.
The ﬁrst, second, . . . derivatives of
x5 are
d
dxx5 = 5x4
d2
dx2 x5 = 5 · 4x3
d3
dx3 x5 = 5 · 4 · 3x2
d4
dx4 x5 = 5 · 4 · 3 · 2x
d5
dx5 x5 = 5 · 4 · 3 · 2 · 1
The notation for a product like 1 ·
2 · . . . · n is n!, read “n factorial.”
So to get a term for our polynomial
whose ﬁfth derivative is 1, we need
x5/5!.
The result for the inﬁnite
series is
ex =
∞
X
n=0
xn
n!
,
where the special case of 0! = 1 is
assumed.1 This is called the Tay-
lor series for ex, evaluated around
x = 0, and it’s true, although I
haven’t proved it, that this partic-
ular Taylor series always converges
to ex, no matter how far x is from
zero.
1This makes sense, because, for exam-
ple, 4!=5!/5, 3!=4!/4, etc., so we should
have 0!=1!/1.

70
CHAPTER 4. TECHNIQUES
A Taylor series can be used to ap-
proximate other functions besides
ex, and when you ask your calcu-
lator to evaluate a function such
as a sine or a cosine, it may ac-
tually be using a Taylor series to
do it. In general, the Taylor series
around x = 0 for a function y is

Here the notation |x=0 means that
the derivative is to be evaluated at
x = 0.
Example 44
The function y = e−1/x2, shown in ﬁg-
ure f, never converges to its Taylor se-
ries, except at x = 0. This is because
the Taylor series for this function, eval-
uated around x = 0 is exactly zero! At
x = 0, we have y = 0, dy/dx = 0,
d2y/dx2 = 0, and so on for every
derivative. The zero function matches
the function y(x) and all its derivatives
to all orders, and yet is useless as an
approximation to y(x).
In general, every function’s Tay-
lor series around x = 0 converges
to the function for all values of x in
the range deﬁned by |x| < r, where
r is some number, known as the ra-
dius of convergence. For the func-
tion ex, the radius of convergence
happens to be inﬁnite, whereas for
e−1/x2 it’s zero.
f / The function e−1/x2
never con-
verges to its Taylor series.
A function’s Taylor series doesn’t
have to be evaluated around x =
0. The Taylor series around some
other center x = c is given by

dx sin x = cos x
d2
dx2 sin x = −sin x
d3
dx3 sin x = −cos x
d4
dx4 sin x = sin x
d5
dx5 sin x = cos x
We can see that there will be a cy-
cle of sin, cos, −sin, and −cos, re-
peating indeﬁnitely. Evaluating these
derivatives at x = 0, we have 0, 1, 0,
−1, . . . . All the even-order terms of
the series are zero, and all the odd-
order terms are ±1/n!. The result is
sin x = x −1
3!x3 + 1
5!x5 −. . .
.
The linear term is the familiar small-
angle approximation sin x ≈x.
The radius of convergence of this se-
ries turns out to be inﬁnite. Intuitively
the reason for this is that the factori-
als grow extremely rapidly, so that the
successive terms in the series even-
tually start diminish quickly, even for
large values of x.
Example 46
▷Find the Taylor series of y = 1/(1−x)

say about its radius of convergence.

. . .
The pattern is that the nth derivative
is n!. The Taylor series therefore has
an = n!/n! = 1:
1
1 −x = 1 + x + x2 + x3 + . . .
The radius of convergence of this se-
ries deﬁnitely can’t be greater than 1,
since for x = 1 the series is 1 + 1 +
1 + . . ., which grows indeﬁnitely with-
out ever converging to a speciﬁc num-
ber. Likewise for x = −1 the series
becomes 1 −1 + 1 −1 + . . ., which
oscillates back and forth rather than
converging. Intuitively we can see a
couple of hints as to why this hap-
pens: (1) The function 1/(1 −x) it-
self misbehaves at x = 1, blowing up
to inﬁnity; (2) The only way a series
can get closer and closer to a ﬁnite
value is if the absolute values of the
terms decrease, and decrease sufﬁ-
ciently rapidly. But the coefﬁcients an
of this Taylor series don’t decrease
with n, so so the only way the abso-
lute values of the terms can decrease
is for |x| < 1.

CHAPTER 4. TECHNIQUES
4.4 Methods of
integration
Change of variable
Sometimes and unfamiliar-looking
integral can be made into a famil-
iar one by substituting a a new
variable for an old one. For exam-
ple, we know how to integrate 1/x
— the answer is ln x — but what
about
Z
dx
2x + 1
?
Let u = 2x + 1.
Diﬀerentiating
both sides, we have du = 2dx, or
dx = du/2, so
Z
dx
2x + 1 =
Z du/2
u
= 1
2 ln u + c
= 1
2 ln(2x + 1) + c
.
In the case of a deﬁnite integral,
we have to remember to change the
limits of integration to reﬂect the
new variable.
Example 47
▷Evaluate
R 4
3 dx/(2x + 1).
▷As before, let u = 2x + 1.
Z x=4
x=3
dx
2x + 1 =
Z u=9
u=7
du/2
u
= 1
2 ln u
˛˛˛˛
u=9
u=7
Here the notation |u=9
u=7 means to eval-
uate the function at 7 and 9, and sub-
tract the former from the latter. The
result is
Z x=4
x=3
dx
2x + 1 = 1
2(ln 9 −ln 7)
= 1
2 ln 9
7
.
Sometimes, as in the next example,
a clever substitution is the secret to
doing a seemingly impossible inte-
gral.
Example 48
▷Evaluate
Z e
√x
√x dx
.
▷The only hope for reducing this to a
form we can do is to let u = √x. Then
dx = d(u2) = 2udu, so
Z e
√x
√x dx =
Z eu
u · 2u du
= 2
Z
eudu
= 2eu
= 2e
√x
.
Example 48 really isn’t so tricky,
since there was only one logical
choice for the substitution that had
any hope of working. The follow-
ing is a little more dastardly.
Example 49
▷Evaluate
Z
dx
1 + x2
.

4.4. METHODS OF INTEGRATION
73
▷The substitution that works is x =
tan u.
First let’s see what this does
to the expression 1 + x2. The familiar
identity
sin2 u + cos2 u = 1
,
when divided by cos2 u, gives
tan2 u + 1 = sec2 u
,
so 1 + x2 becomes sec2 u. But differ-
entiating both sides of x = tan u gives
dx = d
h
sin u(cos u)−1i
= (d sin u)(cos u)−1
+ (sin u)d
h
(cos u)−1i
=
“
1 + tan2 u
”
du
= sec2 u du
,
so the integral becomes
Z
dx
1 + x2 =
Z sec2 udu
sec2 u
= u + c
= tan−1 x + c
.
What mere mortal would ever
have suspected that the substitu-
tion x = tan u was the one that
was needed in example 49?
One
possible answer is to give up and
do the integral on a computer:
Integrate(x) 1/(1+x^2)
ArcTan(x)
Another possible answer is that
you can usually smell the pos-
sibility of this type of substitu-
tion,
involving a trig function,
when the thing to be integrated
contains something reminiscent of
the Pythagorean theorem, as sug-
gested by ﬁgure g. The 1+x2 looks
like what you’d get if you had a
right triangle with legs 1 and x,
and were using the Pythagorean
theorem to ﬁnd its hypotenuse.
g / The substitution x =
tan u.
Example 50
▷Evaluate

▷The

get if you had a right triangle with
hypotenuse 1 and a leg of length x,

orem to ﬁnd the other leg, as in ﬁg-
ure h.
This motivates us to try the
substitution x = cos u, which gives
dx
=
−sin u du and
√
1 −x2
=
√
1 −cos2 u = sin u. The result is
Z

CHAPTER 4. TECHNIQUES
Integration by parts
Figure i shows a technique called
integration by parts.
If the inte-
gral
R
vdu is easier than the inte-
gral
R
udv, then we can calculate
the easier one, and then by sim-
ple geometry determine the one we
wanted. Identifying the large rect-
angle that surrounds both shaded
areas, and the small white rectan-
gle on the lower left, we have
Z
u dv =(area of large rectangle)
−(area of small rectangle)
Z
v du
.
i / Integration by parts.
In the case of an indeﬁnite integral,
we have a similar relationship de-
rived from the product rule:
d(uv) = u dv + v du
u dv = d(uv) −v du
Integrating both sides, we have the
following relation.
Integration by parts
Z
u dv = uv −
Z
v du
.
Since a deﬁnite integral can al-
ways be done by evaluating an in-
deﬁnite integral at its upper and
lower limits, one usually uses this
form. Integrals don’t usually come
prepackaged in a form that makes
it obvious that you should use inte-
gration by parts. What the equa-
tion for integration by parts tells
us is that if we can split up the
integrand into two factors, one of
which (the dv) we know how to
integrate, we have the option of
changing the integral into a new
form in which that factor becomes
its integral, and the other fac-
tor becomes its derivative.
If we
choose the right way of splitting up
the integrand into parts, the result
can be a simpliﬁcation.
Example 51
▷Evaluate
Z
x cos x dx
▷There are two obvious possibilities
for splitting up the integrand into fac-

75
tors,
u dv = (x)(cos x dx)
or
u dv = (cos x)(x dx)
.
The ﬁrst one is the one that lets us
make progress. If u = x, then du = dx,
and if dv = cos x dx, then integration
gives v = sin x.
Z
x cos x dx =
Z
u dv
= uv −
Z
v du
= x sin x −
Z
sin x dx
= x sin x + cos x
Of the two possibilities we consid-
ered for u and dv, the reason this
one helped was that differentiating x
gave dx, which was simpler, and in-
tegrating cos xdx gave sin x, which
was no more complicated than be-
fore.
The second possibility would
have made things worse rather than
better, because integrating xdx would
have given x2/2, which would have
been more complicated rather than
less.

isn’t explicitly written as a product, and
yet we can attack it using integration

But note that the original form is

dx

,
while
faced
with
the
form

known how to integrate it.
The idea of the method of partial
fractions is that if we want to do

CHAPTER 4. TECHNIQUES
an integral of the form
Z
dx
P(x)
,
where P(x) is an nth order poly-
nomial, we can always rewrite 1/P
as
1
P(x) =
A1
x −r1
+ . . .
An
x −rn
,
where r1 . . . rn are the roots of the
polynomial, i.e., the solutions of
the equation P(r) = 0. If the poly-
nomial is second-order, you can
ﬁnd the roots r1 and r2 using
the quadratic formula; I’ll assume
for the time being that they’re
real.
For higher-order polynomi-
als, there is no sureﬁre, easy way
of ﬁnding the roots by hand, and
you’d be smart simply to use com-
puter software to do it. In Yacas,
you can ﬁnd the real roots of a
polynomial like this:
FindRealRoots(x^4-5*x^3
-25*x^2+65*x+84)
{3.,7.,-4.,-1.}
(I assume it uses Newton’s method
to ﬁnd them.)
The constants Ai
can then be determined by alge-
bra, or by the trick of evaluating
1/P(x) for a value of x very close
to one of the roots. In the exam-
ple of the polynomial x4 −5x3 −
25x2 + 65x + 84, let r1 . . . r4 be
the roots in the order in which they
were returned by Yacas. Then A1
can be found by evaluating 1/P(x)
at x = 3.000001:
P(x):=x^4-5*x^3-25*x^2
+65*x+84
N(1/P(3.000001))
-8928.5702094768
We know that for x very close to
3, the expression
1
P =
A1
x −3 + A2
x −7 + A3
x + 4 + A4
x + 1
will be dominated by the A1 term,
so
−8930 ≈
A1
3.000001 −3
A1 ≈(−8930)(10−6)
.
By the same method we can ﬁnd
the other four constants:
dx:=.000001
N(1/P(7+dx),30)*dx
0.2840908276e-2
N(1/P(-4+dx),30)*dx
-0.4329006192e-2
N(1/P(-1+dx),30)*dx
0.1041666664e-1
(The N( ,30) construct is to tell
Yacas to do a numerical calcula-
tion rather than an exact symbolic
one, and to use 30 digits of pre-
cision, in order to avoid problems
with rounding errors.) Thus,
1
P = −8.93 × 10−3
x −3
+ 2.84 × 10−3
x −7
−4.33 × 10−3
x + 4
+ 1.04 × 10−2
x + 1
.

4.4. METHODS OF INTEGRATION
77
The desired integral is
Z
dx
P(x) = −8.93 × 10−3 ln(x −3)
+ 2.84 × 10−3 ln(x −7)
−4.33 × 10−3 ln(x + 4)
+ 1.04 × 10−2 ln(x + 1)
+ c
.
There are some possible complica-
tions: (1) The same factor may oc-
cur more than once, as in x3−5x2+
7x−3 = (x−1)(x−1)(x−3). In this
example, we have to look for an an-
swer of the form A/(x−1)+B/(x−
1)2 + C/(x −3), the solution being
−.25/(x−1)−.5/(x−1)2+.25/(x−
3). (2) The roots may be complex.
This is no show-stopper if you’re
using computer software that han-
dles complex numbers gracefully.
(You can choose a c that makes the
result real.) In fact, as discussed in
section 5.3, some beautiful things
can happen with complex roots.
But as an alternative, any polyno-
mial with real coeﬃcients can be
factored into linear and quadratic
factors with real coeﬃcients. For
each quadratic factor Q(x), we
then have a partial fraction of the
form (A+Bx)/Q(x), where A and
B can be determined by algebra.
In Yacas, this can be done using
the Apart function.
Example 53
▷Evaluate the integral
Z
dx
(x4 −8 ∗x3 + 8 ∗x2 −8 ∗x + 7
using the method of partial fractions.
▷First we use Yacas to look for real
roots of the polynomial:
FindRealRoots(x^4-8*x^3
+8*x^2-8*x+7)
{1.,7.}
Unfortunately this polynomial seems
to have only two real roots; the rest
are complex. We can divide out the
factor (x −1)(x −7), but that still
leaves us with a second-order polyno-
mial, which has no real roots. One ap-
proach would be to factor the polyno-
mial into the form (x −1)(x −7)(x −
p)(x −q), where p and q are complex,
as in section 5.3. Instead, let’s use Ya-
cas to expand the integrand in terms
of partial fractions:
Apart(1/(x^4-8*x^3
+8*x^2-8*x+7))
((2*x)/25+3/50)/(x^2+1)
+1/(300*(x-7))
+(-1)/(12*(x-1))
We can now rewrite the integral like
this:

x dx
x2 + 1

Z

x2 + 1

+ 1
300 ln(x −7)
−1
12 ln(x −1)
+c
In fact, Yacas should be able to do
the whole integral for us from scratch,
but it’s best to understand how these
things work under the hood, and to
avoid being completely dependent on
one particular piece of software. As
an illustration of this gem of wisdom,
I found that when I tried to make Ya-
cas evaluate the integral in one gulp,
it choked because the calculation be-
came too complicated! Because I un-
derstood the ideas behind the proce-
dure, I was still able to get a result
through a mixture of computer calcu-
lations and working it by hand. Some-
one who didn’t have the knowledge of
the technique might have tried the in-
tegral using the software, seen it fail,
and concluded, incorrectly, that the in-
tegral was one that simply couldn’t be
done. A computer is no substitute for
understanding.

In free fall, the acceleration will

resistance.
For example, a sky-

rather approaches a certain maxi-

force of air resistance cancels out
the force of gravity. If an object is
dropped from a height h, and the
time it takes to reach the ground is
used to measure the acceleration of
gravity, g, then the relative error in
the result due to air resistance is2

a / Visualizing complex numbers as
points in a plane.
We assume there is a number, i,
such that i2 = −1.
The square
roots of −1 are then i and −i. (In
electrical engineering work, where
i stands for current, j is sometimes
used instead.)
This gives rise to
a number system, called the com-
plex numbers, containing the real

the real and imaginary axes don’t ac-
tually represent directions in space.
numbers as a subset.
Any com-
plex number z can be written in
the form z = a + bi, where a and
b are real, and a and b are then
referred to as the real and imagi-
nary parts of z.
A number with
a zero real part is called an imag-
inary number. The complex num-
bers can be visualized as a plane,
ﬁgure a, with the real number line
placed horizontally like the x axis
of the familiar x−y plane, and the
imaginary numbers running along
the y axis.
The complex num-
bers are complete in a way that the
real numbers aren’t: every nonzero
complex number has two square
roots.
For example, 1 is a real

Complex numbers can be added
and subtracted by adding or sub-
tracting their real and imaginary
parts, ﬁgure b. Geometrically, this
is the same as vector addition.
The complex numbers a + bi and
a −bi, lying at equal distances
above and below the real axis, are
called complex conjugates. The re-
sults of the quadratic formula are
either both real, or complex conju-
gates of each other. The complex
conjugate of a number z is notated
as ¯z or z∗.
The complex numbers obey all the
same rules of arithmetic as the re-
als, except that they can’t be or-
dered along a single line. That is,
it’s not possible to say whether one
complex number is greater than
another.
We can compare them
in terms of their magnitudes (their
distances from the origin),
but
two distinct complex numbers may
have the same magnitude, so, for
example, we can’t say whether 1 is
greater than i or i is greater than
1.

of multiplying complex numbers.
However, there is another nice in-
terpretation of complex multiplica-
tion.
We deﬁne the argument of
a complex number, ﬁgure d, as its
angle in the complex plane, mea-
sured counterclockwise from the
positive real axis.

roots of a complex number?
▷
Answer, p. 111
Example 55
The magnitude |z| of a complex num-
ber z obeys the identity |z|2 = z¯z.
To prove this, we ﬁrst note that ¯z has
the same magnitude as z, since ﬂip-
ping it to the other side of the real axis
doesn’t change its distance from the
origin. Multiplying z by ¯z gives a re-
sult whose magnitude is found by mul-
tiplying their magnitudes, so the mag-
nitude of z¯z must therefore equal |z|2.
Now we just have to prove that z¯z is a
positive real number. But if, for exam-
ple, z lies counterclockwise from the
real axis, then ¯z lies clockwise from
it. If z has a positive argument, then
¯z has a negative one, or vice-versa.
The sum of their arguments is there-
fore zero, so the result has an argu-
ment of zero, and is on the positive
real axis. 1
1I cheated a little. If z’s argument is
e / The argument of uv is the sum of
the arguments of u and v.
This whole system was built up
in order to make every number
have square roots.
What about
cube roots, fourth roots, and so
on? Does it get even more weird
when you want to do those as well?
No. The complex number system
we’ve already discussed is suﬃcient
to handle all of them. The nicest
way of thinking about it is in terms
of roots of polynomials.
In the
real number system, the polyno-
mial x2 −1 has two roots, i.e., two
values of x (plus and minus one)
that we can plug in to the polyno-
mial and get zero. Because it has
these two real roots, we can rewrite
the polynomial as (x −1)(x + 1).
However, the polynomial x2+1 has
no real roots. It’s ugly that in the
real number system, some second-
30 degrees, then we could say ¯z’s was -30,
but we could also call it 330. That’s OK,
because 330+30 gives 360, and an argu-
ment of 360 is the same as an argument
of zero.
