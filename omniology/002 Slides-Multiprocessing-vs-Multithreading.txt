Multithreading
●
Threading in python is used to run multiple threads (tasks, function calls) at the same 
time inside the same process
●
Thereding is not suitable for CPU intensive application 
 
●
Python threads are best used in cases where the execution of a task involves some 
waiting (ex: I/O operations)
●
Python uses the threading module to start multiple threads

Multiprocessing
●
Multiprocessing achieves true parallelism in Python
●
Low risk of data-corruption when using multiprocessing
●
Each spawned process will have their own allocated memory 
●
Each process has it’s owned GIL so there’s no resource conflict or race condition here
●
Python uses the multiprocessing module to achieve parallel programming
