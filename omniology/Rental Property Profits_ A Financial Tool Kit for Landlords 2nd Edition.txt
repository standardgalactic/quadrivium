INTRODUCTION
what this book will do for you
The nature of real estate investing has changed from the certainty and safety 
of the past. When the first edition of this book was published in 2005, the 
real estate world was vastly different than it is today. In that book, statistics 
from the National Association of Realtors (NAR) showed that the average 
sales price of new homes had risen almost every year for many years.
Real estate was dependable. 
The market for real estate investors was without question a safe and 
profitable one. It was cited as a safe alternative to investing in the stock 
market. The numbers look very different today, especially considering the 
devastating decline in real estate between 2008 and 2015. However, now 
that this cyclical decline has ended, real estate investing is better than ever. 
As the coming chapters reveal, the number of renters has increased to an 
all-time high, meaning greater demand for rental housing. Average rents 
have increased as a result, even as housing prices have fallen across the 
country.
By definition, a sound investment is one with low prices and excellent 
income-generating levels. This describes residential real estate today. And 
that is the primary focus of this book: the single-family home bought for the 
purpose of renting it to tenants with several goals in mind: 
+
+ Rents high enough to pay all or most of the home’s mortgage and 
other costs
+
+ Increasing equity value over time, translating to a profitable 
investment
+
+ Continued favorable tax advantages in owning rental property

introduction
[ xii ]
The claim made in the first sentence of the first edition is true once again: 
Real estate investing is a practical alternative to the stock market for many 
reasons. 
Serious investors may certainly beat inflation and earn profits in the stock 
market, without any doubt. But having real estate as an alternative does not 
mean abandoning stocks entirely in favor of rental properties. It does mean 
expanding an investment portfolio. Real estate is one of the few investments 
that can generate current income and cover mortgage costs each month, 
while enabling you to protect the investment through insurance and the 
maintenance of the property and its value.
The suggestion involves more. As a means for diversifying risks, real 
estate that is well selected and carefully maintained will gain value over 
time. Stocks might gain value as well, but there are no guarantees that this 
will occur. With real estate, the generation of monthly income does not 
provide such guarantees either, but it does cover the cost of borrowing the 
money to invest in rental properties.
With the combination of sheltered income and reduced income taxes, the 
true net cash flow of real estate—when calculated on an after-tax basis—is 
difficult to beat by any other market, including the stock market, where tax 
benefits accrue only if you have your shares in a tax-sheltered account such 
as an IRA or other retirement plan.
It is not a simple process, however. Real estate investing requires you to 
master tax reporting and filing rules, to set up complete and thorough 
records, and to establish fair and consistent methods for assigning expenses 
to properties. This is where this book helps. There is no reason to avoid real 
estate investments just because the tax and record keeping demands are 
considerable. You can hire a qualified expert to help with these matters, 
especially regarding taxes and how they have to be reported and supported 
with a set of books. However, even when you own several properties at the 
same time, developing a workable system is not as complex as it might seem. 
Even without expert help, you can develop an effective system for recording 
and tracking a range of costs and expenses. Real estate investing involves a 
large volume of transactions, including supplies to perform maintenance, 
hiring experts to fix broken systems, payment of utilities, and capital 
expenditures (buildings, autos and trucks, furniture, and improvements). 
These also involve calculations of depreciation, which is not as complicated 
as many people think.
You are not required to become an expert in accounting or tax law to 
succeed as a real estate investor. However, you probably will need 
professional help in some areas involved with real estate investing, including 
developing rental contracts, reporting taxes, and, commonly, the assistance 

introduction
[ xiii ]
of contractors, appraisers, real estate agents, escrow or legal consultants, 
and perhaps a management company if you buy properties far from where 
you live. 
This book is not intended as a replacement for the expert advice you need; 
however, it will help you to become a more informed real estate investor. And 
the more informed you are, the more likely it is that you will succeed. The only 
area of expertise you should expect to develop is a focus on investment value, 
the ability to select good investments with growth potential, and a realistic 
understanding of supply and demand within the market itself (in terms of 
property value, rental demand levels, and mortgage lending).
This book breaks down the complexities of property selection, cash flow 
calculations and planning, and basic real estate bookkeeping. It is set up as 
a reference guide for anyone wanting to invest in real estate but who is not 
experienced in tax planning, bookkeeping, depreciation calculations, loss 
limits under the tax law, and the all-important considerations of finding a 
lender and working with an appraiser.

THE NATURE OF  
REAL ESTATE INVESTING
R
eal estate, over time, has been the most consistently profitable investment 
choice you can make. As long as you research ahead of time, know your 
market, and pick specific properties carefully, your investment should grow 
over time. This is true even in light of the depressed market since 2008. This 
period of time has been among the worst markets for real estate in many 
years. However, the market inevitably recovers from its negative cycles and 
comes back as strongly as ever.
This is why right now is a great time for investors to look seriously at the 
possibility of becoming a real estate investor. For most investors, the first 
question to ask is how much risk is appropriate. The answer to this question 
will help in the decision as to whether to proceed as a real estate investor or 
to look elsewhere.
Most people start out investing in residential property. A single-family 
house or small multiunit property (two to four units) is manageable and 
affordable, and you can always step up from there to buy additional 
properties or exchange your initial investment for larger ones. To get started, 
you want to define what you hope to achieve by purchasing real estate. 
Property is far more expensive than most other investments, so you will be 
making a commitment in most cases to a mortgage. The majority of 
investment value will consist of borrowed money, so you will depend on 
rental income to make your investment affordable. Given the potential 
affordability of real estate (with tenants essentially covering your mortgage 
payment for you), the consistent historical growth of real estate values, and 
the exceptionally good tax advantages, the benefits of real estate investing are 
significant. However, “affordable” is not restricted to net profits but, much

more significantly, extends to the cash flow generated by the investment—
that is, the comparison between money coming in and money going out. You 
need positive cash flow or, at worst, a breakeven form of cash flow in a 
majority of cases. Most investors cannot—and should not—afford to carry 
negative cash flow from their investments.
AN OVERVIEW OF THE MARKET 
Since residential property is, by far, the most common real estate investment, 
examples in this book focus on single-family housing. Other choices (such 
as raw land speculation, commercial, and industrial properties) are much 
more advanced and beyond the interest of most investors. 
The residential housing market can be easily studied in any given area. 
You can readily find information about the local population, employment, 
rental occupancy and vacancy rates, and the level of new construction under 
way. These factors add up to the supply and demand for real estate in your 
city or town. This, then, is the logical starting point if you are thinking of 
investing in real estate. 
KeY Point Information about local supply and demand for rental 
property can be found through local real estate brokers, appraisers, and 
bankers. Multiple Listing Service (MLS) publications also provide detailed 
information about property pricing and trends. 
Valuable resource To locate Multiple Listing Service (MLS) 
in your city or town, go to http://www.mls.com.
To find specific properties for sale in your area and to judge the market 
prices in great detail, even down to neighborhood or zip code, check the 
many online sources for current listings as well as for recent sales of homes 
similar to those you are targeting as potential investments.

[ 3 ]
Supply and Demand 
The supply and demand for residential property involves three distinct and 
separate markets. First is the market price trend of housing, the best known 
and understood market. In this market, buyers want to know, first and 
foremost, what a house will cost. The second market focuses on supply and 
demand for rental units. Third is the market for available sources of mortgage 
financing. 
The first market can be evaluated in terms of how prices change over 
time. Are houses selling for more this year than last year? What is the 
percentage of growth? Housing prices have beaten inflation over many 
years, with the recent exception in this market beginning in late 2008. The 
longer-term trend places housing among the strongest of growth investments. 
Assuming, of course, that you’ve selected property on the basis of good 
research and sound market analysis, you can expect real estate to be less 
volatile than the stock market, consistent in its growth rate over time, and 
safer by far than other alternatives. In many regions, prices have remained 
flat or have declined, so using national averages is not a safe way to pick a 
market. You need to check the regional trend to ensure that real estate in 
your town represents a viable investment. In areas where employment is 
strong and the population is growing, real estate values tend to grow as well. 
The market value of property is only the first of three important “markets” 
in real estate. 
The second market involves demand for rentals. What is the average 
vacancy level? A very low vacancy rate is a positive sign, but a fluctuating or 
high vacancy indicates that there is more supply than demand. If that is the 
case, then the timing would not be good for investment, at least not right in 
your city. The trend between 2008 and 2016 has been for housing prices to 
decline (over most regions), leading to more people renting than buying. This 
increased rental level has driven market rentals upward. So as housing costs 
fall and market rents rise, the market for real estate investors is ideal, consisting 
of low investment prices along with higher rents.
The third market is that for mortgage money. In 2016, rates were lower 
than they had been for many years, in the range of 3 percent. This is an 
extraordinary opportunity for investors, with the cost of borrowed money 
lower than it has been for many years. However, the rate is not the entire 
story. Qualifying for a mortgage involves a combination of lending rules and 
standards, your personal credit history, and the level of equity (your down 
payment) versus the percentage you would like to borrow. If you do not have 
money for a down payment or if your credit score is poor, you will face 
difficulties in getting a mortgage at a desirable rate.

[ 4 ]
KeY Point The combined supply and demand features of the three 
forms of real estate markets are going to vary from one location to the 
next, often drastically. The next town over may have vastly different real 
estate features, and even within one city, the supply and demand can 
(and does) vary from one area to the next. It is essential to understand 
the population, employment, market value, and vacancy trends—in 
advance of committing money. 
The Basic Equation 
More details on these essential ideas are covered in later chapters. As an 
overview, however, a basic equation is an important starting point. The 
short-term market attributes of rental property are going to affect how well 
you can afford to invest money now. The whole market is likely to look 
different in a few years, but you want to make sure you have a reasonable 
expectation of keeping tenants in the property each month. The equation 
worth keeping in mind is a balance between how much money you receive 
(in rent) and how much you have to pay out (in mortgage payments and 
expenses). For that equation to work, you want to keep the property occupied 
as consistently as possible. Any time the property is vacant represents lost 
income, but your mortgage payment continues from month to month.
An Investor’s Point of View 
The market for residential real estate is not difficult for most people to 
understand. If you own a home, you know all about mortgage payments and 
the importance of being able to afford the payment each month. Anyone who 
has not yet bought a home knows that landlords expect rent to be paid on 
time. So the basic economics of real estate are familiar to everyone and are not 
as mysterious as the market forces at work in other markets, such as the stock 
market.
In evaluating investments, though, you need to look at properties from a 
different perspective. When you shop for your primary residence, you are 
interested in the comfort features, condition, and size of the property. As a 
real estate investor, you might be willing to buy property that would not 
interest you as a primary residence but that is ideally suited for rental 
purposes. 

tHe nature of real estate inVesting 
[ 5 ]
EXAMPLE: You have a growing family and need a house with several 
bedrooms for your own use. However, you have discovered that relatively 
small houses make excellent rentals. A two-bedroom house in modest 
condition is relatively inexpensive compared to other types of properties 
and is easy to keep occupied. A married couple or single person is 
drawn to such rentals and can afford what you will need to ask in rent, 
so such properties are easier to keep occupied than more expensive, 
larger homes would be. 
In this example, your revaluation of the market would be made with rental 
income and payments in mind, rather than from the point of view of a 
homeowner. The investment attributes of your decision are going to be far 
different from your personal requirements. 
KeY Point When you search for investment properties, your criteria 
are far different than what they are for your primary residence—a primary 
distinction to keep in mind. 
The real estate market has grown in value over time, even though recent 
trends have been negative. This is a national average, of course, and all real 
estate is local. This means that it is essential to understand the local features 
of supply and demand before investing. You cannot depend on national 
averages or even on local trends for the long term. If local property grows in 
value over fifteen or twenty years in the future, that is a promising feature. 
At the same time, you need to ensure that rental demand is strong right now, 
in order to cover your mortgage payments. As you look for potential rental 
investments, try to locate properties that are affordable, most likely to 
maintain value (and grow in value), and appealing to likely tenants. 
REASONS TO INVEST 
IN REAL ESTATE 
There are many good reasons to buy real estate. Among the most important 
reasons—assuming the local market conditions make it a viable choice—are 
the following: 

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 6 ]
 
Diversification and Asset Allocation. Sound investment requires spreading 
capital over dissimilar investments. You would not want to put all of your 
capital into a low-yielding savings account, or into a single stock, or into 
real estate. You are better off diversifying your capital. You may wonder: If 
real estate is sure to grow over time, why not put all of your money into 
rentals? Diversification is important because different investments have 
different attributes. The stock market is volatile and you can make or lose 
money quickly; however, your money can be invested or taken out quickly. 
Savings accounts are safe but yield very little. Well-selected real estate is 
going to increase in value over time, but it is very difficult to get your money 
out if you need it for an emergency. You need to diversify your capital so 
that you have some funds available as you need them, some funds in very 
safe investments, and some in investments likely to grow over time. 
A more sophisticated view of diversification is called asset allocation. 
This is a strategic planning technique in which a portfolio is spread among 
many different markets or segments. While diversification usually refers to 
spreading risks within one market (buying many different stocks), asset 
allocation is broader. For example, you may want to have some money in 
ready-cash accounts as an emergency reserve fund; other capital invested in 
stocks, whether owned directly or purchased through a mutual fund; and 
yet more of your capital invested in real estate. These three markets 
represent completely different levels of risk and opportunity, and each is 
going to perform according to very different market forces. 
Real estate is a superb market for asset allocation because of its strong 
historic attributes. Your ability to allocate capital among dissimilar markets 
protects your capital from cyclical changes. In times when the stock market 
is weak or falling, real estate may be strong. In fact, it is likely. Offsetting 
profit and loss effects of stocks and real estate occur time and again. 
Diversification within a single market and asset allocation among many 
different markets are sensible portfolio management techniques. Real estate 
is a good fit for strategic asset allocation. It is different from the stock 
market, however. Investors wanting to get out of stocks for the moment but 
who plan to go back in a few months later have to decide where to place 
capital, either in other stocks or in different markets. Real estate is a 
longer-term investment, though. So if you plan to employ real estate in your 
asset allocation plan, it should be treated as a longer-term decision. You do 
not want to buy real estate in March and then look to sell it in June in order 
to put capital back into the stock market. That would be an expensive and, 
given closing-cost levels, a difficult move to make profitably. 
 
Cash Flow. With most investments, you place cash in someone else’s care, 
then you receive dividends, interest, or capital gains. You are 100 percent 
invested, and there is little or no question of cash flow. With real estate, 

tHe nature of real estate inVesting 
[ 7 ]
you usually make a down payment and finance the lion’s share of the 
investment; so cash flow becomes critical. Most real estate investors 
depend on rental income to cover their mortgage payment. The bad news: 
If you do not keep the property rented every month, you have to make the 
mortgage payment from your other funds. The good news: If you keep the 
property occupied, then tenants’ rental payments are used to make those 
mortgage payments. In this situation—and given no unexpected extra 
expenses—the property pays for itself. When you purchase properties at 
the right price for your local market and when rents are high enough to 
cover your mortgage payment, you will have a positive cash flow. When 
you consider the tax benefits of reporting losses (which are created because 
you are also allowed to depreciate your rental property), it is possible to 
have positive cash flow and, at the same time, a net tax loss. This seemingly 
contradictory situation is quite common. When the tax benefits from net 
losses with depreciation create monthly tax savings, you can enjoy the best 
of both worlds: having tax losses to deduct while you collect more cash 
than you pay out. 
 
Leverage. Most individuals cannot afford to buy property outright and pay 
cash, just as most homeowners cannot afford to pay for their own homes 
all at once. One attribute of real estate investing is the need, in most cases, 
to finance 70 percent or more of the purchase price. As a strategic 
approach to investing, leverage is recognized as an important and 
advantageous method to use. Leverage means employing a limited amount 
of capital to purchase and control a greater value in investment. You 
would not be likely to borrow money to buy stocks because the stock 
market is an uncertain and risky place. However, properly selected and 
researched real estate is far less likely to lose market value. Not only does 
real estate tend to grow in value over time when other economic factors 
are positive; it is also insured through a fire insurance policy, and investors 
have direct control over the investment. Ownership in stock is uncertain 
and less tangible, but, given the features of locally owned and managed 
real estate, leverage makes a lot of sense.
Weighing the Pros and Cons 
The overall benefits of investing in real estate—combining growth, safety, 
and tax features—make it a choice worthy of serious consideration. You 
cannot expect this beneficial combination from any other investment. While 
cash invested in real estate is difficult to take out (because it can be removed 
only through refinancing or selling in most cases), the overall benefits of real 
estate make it worthwhile, especially if you balance your capital between 
real estate and other areas. 

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 8 ]
Even with all of the long-term benefits of real estate investing, however, 
you should expect to face some problems as a real estate investor. The need 
to borrow money to buy property is a significant risk, so you must be 
prepared to live with debt. There can be unanticipated expenses, such as for 
repairs, property tax hikes, or utility rate increases. Neighborhoods can 
change for the worse, the local economy can fall apart, or a large employer 
may close down or move away. 
Another potential problem area involves dealing with tenants. The 
landlord–tenant relationship is usually amiable and fair. It is occasionally 
emotional or illogical. As a landlord, you accept the risk that some tenants 
will not be pleasant to work with. This is one feature of real estate that 
discourages many people from proceeding. If your temperament is 
inappropriate for dealing with tenants, then you should not buy real estate. 
At the same time, if the risk of problems can be mitigated by checking 
references, and if you are willing to go through those steps, then you will 
increase your chances for a positive, enjoyable, and profitable experience. 
KeY Point You should be aware of these potential problems, large 
and small, before you get into real estate investing, but many people find 
that the positives far outweigh the negatives. 
THE IMPORTANCE OF TAX PLANNING 
The benefits of real estate are difficult to ignore, and they make a strong case 
in support of including real estate in your portfolio. Equally important, tax 
planning requires serious thought and continually looking ahead. 
Anticipating potential tax-related problems in the future is always a 
necessary move, not only in managing your investments but generally as 
well. Real estate investors need to plan. The obvious reason—to reduce 
current-year tax liabilities—is only one part of the larger picture. Of course, 
you want to time decisions as much as possible to minimize taxes. The 
second part has to be kept in mind as well: the limitation on annual 
deductions. This comes in two forms: dollar amount and your income level. 
Annual Dollar Limit 
The dollar amount is set at $25,000. You can deduct that much per year as 
long as your family income is at or below $100,000. If you are married but 
separated, or if you are single, the dollar amount may be lower, or it could 

tHe nature of real estate inVesting 
[ 9 ]
even disappear completely. So married couples living apart and contemplating 
divorce need to plan carefully to minimize the tax consequences of divorce 
when real estate investments are involved. 
In situations where you believe your tax losses will exceed $25,000, you 
will have to carry the excess over to future years or to the time you sell 
your investment property. This requires planning. For example, you can 
defer current-year expenses to next year to avoid spending money for 
deductions you do not need. You can also extend the time you use to 
depreciate assets, to reduce current-year expenses, and to move deductions 
to future years. 
Income Level 
The second consideration is your overall income. If your annual adjusted 
gross income, as calculated for real estate tax purposes, exceeds $100,000, 
you lose 50 cents in deduction for each dollar above. For example, if your 
income this year will be $110,000, your ceiling will be reduced by one-half 
of the income above $100,000. So half of $10,000, or $5,000, is applied 
against the ceiling of $25,000, and your maximum loss will be reduced to 
$20,000 for the year. 
KeY Point  Deferring payment of expenses or extending depreciation 
until later years makes sense if you cannot take full advantage of those 
deductions this year. Planning for tax purposes is an essential and 
important feature of investing in real estate. If you are not thoroughly 
versed in tax law (including the laws in your state), you should consult with 
a qualified tax expert and get assistance in planning ahead for tax benefits 
or for the consequences of decisions you make throughout the year. 
YOUR CREDIT APPLIED  
TO REAL ESTATE INVESTING 
One important consideration for every real estate investor is often overlooked 
or not mentioned at all. That is the quality of your personal credit. Because 
you will be borrowing money to buy rental properties, lenders will be keenly 
interested in your credit standing. 
Homeowners—even those with poor credit—may be able to find a lender 
willing to carry a loan. This is because owner-occupied property is very low 
risk, and lenders recognize this fact. In comparison, investment property loans 

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 10 ]
are more likely to be foreclosed. If the demand for rentals falls and investors 
cannot meet their mortgage obligations, it is possible that the investor will 
simply walk away from the investment. So lenders are sensitive to the possibility 
of default on investment property mortgage loans. If an investor’s credit is not 
impeccable, it will be more difficult to find loans. With the higher-risk levels 
in mind, lenders require higher down payments for investment property; 
lenders may also require higher loan points and other fees, just to offset their 
higher risks. The standards are higher, and for good reason. 
What the Lender Might Require 
If your credit rating is less than perfect, you may have to meet a series of 
extra requirements. These could include: 
+
+ Higher down payment requirements, so that you have more invested 
capital at stake, which in turn reduces the likelihood that you will 
just walk away from the loan obligation if the costs of keeping the 
property get too high 
+
+ Higher loan origination and other fees, charged to reduce the 
lender’s risk of default on your part 
+
+ Closer scrutiny of financial information and more reporting than 
usual, so that loan underwriters will be confident that the 
information you provide is accurate and complete 
+
+ More appraisal, inspection, and other outside fees, to ensure that 
the property being financed does not have hidden maintenance costs 
or is not overvalued 
+
+ A higher interest rate on the loan itself, due to the higher level of 
risk to the lender 
Income vs. Obligations 
If your income is too low to qualify for the loan you seek, you will have to put 
more money down or simply wait until your income level rises. You may also 
need to start out with a less expensive property so that your income will 
qualify you for the investment. Although different lenders employ many 
variations of the basic strategy, they all look at the numbers in the same way. 
They calculate your net monthly income (your take-home pay) and then take 
a percentage of that as the maximum obligation they will accept for your 
mortgage payment. (The “obligation” usually includes mortgage principal and 
interest, property taxes, and insurance.) If the payment goes over that level, 
the loan will be rejected in its present form. You may need to reduce the 
obligation by making a larger down payment, for example. 

tHe nature of real estate inVesting 
[ 11 ]
When you fill out a loan application, you are required to estimate monthly 
obligations as well as monthly rental income. A lender is probably going to 
reduce the estimated income you report to allow for possible vacancies. The 
degree of adjustment will depend on recent vacancy levels in the area, a 
statistic that the lender will know or have access to. So your total net income 
will include your take-home pay, any other income (from dividends and 
interest, for example), and rentals (adjusted downward for the vacancy 
factor). The net total of this calculation is then multiplied by a specific 
percentage that the lender uses to qualify investment property mortgage 
loans. If the total obligation exceeds the predetermined percentage of total 
income, the lender will not approve the loan. 
KeY Point: The review of your loan application will be much easier if 
your credit is excellent. The better your credit, the easier it will be to find 
acceptable financing. For anyone with poor credit, the flexibility of being 
able to finance properties, without concern for being rejected, is going to 
be curtailed. That does not mean it will be impossible to find a loan, but 
the loan is going to be more expensive, and review time is likely to be 
greater as well. 
Getting Preapproval for Your Loan 
Prospective first-time homeowners can find a lender to prequalify them. 
Based on income level and credit history, the borrower can find out what 
level of investment the lender can and will approve. The lender reveals the 
maximum loan it will grant based on the borrower’s financial information. 
The preapproval is conditional because the lender also wants to ensure that 
the property being purchased is worth what the homeowner intends to pay 
and that its condition is acceptable for lending purposes. 
The preapproval of a mortgage loan for investment purposes is not quite 
as easy. Because the equation includes rental income, it will be impossible 
for the lender to assess the borrower’s overall income and obligation without 
the specific property in mind. 
You may be able to obtain conditional preapproval from a lender. The 
qualifications will include the usual appraisal and condition standards but 
will also go beyond that to require acceptable rental income after deducting 
an estimated vacancy factor. Assuming that the lender would qualify you on 
the basis of a comparison between total income and mortgage obligation, 
you may receive a type of preapproval even when your credit is not perfect. 
At least a lender may be willing to stipulate that your application will be 

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 12 ]
given serious consideration. Some lenders won’t go that far, making it clear 
that they will not approve loans if your credit is poor, regardless of property 
value and condition. 
Poor credit is also the reason lenders are less likely to approve an equity 
line of credit. Most lenders limit lines of credit to primary residences, 
although some allow borrowers to take Home Equity Line of Credit 
(HELOC) contracts on rental properties—but as a rule, this exception is 
allowed only if the borrower’s credit is exceptional. 
MAINTAINING INVESTMENT PERSPECTIVE 
In every type of investment, you are wise to keep your perspective. For 
example, if you buy shares of stock because a stranger on an investment chat 
room tells you its price will go through the roof, you have no one but yourself 
to blame if you lose money. If you invest because a stockbroker tells you it’s 
a “good” investment and that turns out not to be true, then it means your 
trust was misplaced. 
The same caution applies to real estate. Success in investing is the result 
of thorough research; the identification of sound, sensible investments in 
strong markets; and ongoing maintenance. (In the case of stocks, you want 
to hold shares as long as value is rising and the fundamental strength is 
high and then sell when conditions change. In the case of real estate, 
maintenance means finding the best tenants and then keeping an eye on 
the property.) 
There are no easy ways to accumulate wealth. Yes, some people have 
made fortunes in real estate by buying in the right place at the right time, 
but it is also true that they took risks and worked to acquire and maintain 
their properties. If you discover that you are simply not satisfied with your 
investments, you should sell and get out. For a stock investor, this means 
selling the shares if you spend your nights lying awake and worrying. For a 
real estate investor, you should not have to dread your telephone ringing, 
fearing it is a tenant calling with a complaint. If you have to fight every 
month to get your rent or if you even worry about the possibility of such 
problems, then real estate is not right for you. 
Risk Tolerance 
Maintaining your perspective also has to include an ongoing evaluation of 
long-term goals and your personal risk tolerance. Keeping real estate for the 
long term should be coordinated with a specific idea that you have about 
your reasons for wealth accumulation, matched with your expectations for 

tHe nature of real estate inVesting 
[ 13 ]
growth in real estate values (all on an after-tax basis, of course, because real 
estate tax benefits are significant). Risk tolerance has three major aspects 
when real estate is involved. These are: 
1. Tenant Issues. The most important level of risk involves your relationship 
with tenants. This is far more important than investment value or cash 
flow. Even if your investment works well on paper, tenants can affect 
your quality of life directly—especially if they are giving you trouble. If 
your experiences are negative, then you have exceeded your risk tolerance. 
The problem has to be fixed (which may be as easy as replacing a poor 
tenant with a good one); otherwise, it makes no sense to keep the 
properties. In the end, the whole experience has to be enjoyable for you. 
Many investors have problem-free relations with tenants; others have 
not had universally positive experiences. The potential problems vary by 
area, due to the relative strength of landlord–tenant laws. In some states, 
tenants have very strong rights, which may lead to the abuse of landlords. 
In those states, you could have great difficulty if you end up with a tenant 
who does not pay rent, and it could take many months to evict a problem 
tenant. In other states, the laws are less complex or are even favorable to 
landlords. 
2. Market Value. The best known form of investment risk is the change in 
market value. Is your property value growing? On a month-to-month basis, 
tenants are expected to pay rent adequate to make your mortgage payment; 
so over the long term, you should be able to accumulate equity through 
rents. However, the risk exposure is worthwhile only if property values are 
rising as well. If market value is not growing, you might consider selling 
the property and investing in one with more potential. 
3. Cash Flow. Of course, you want rental income to cover your mortgage 
payment and other expenses. An after-tax positive cash flow is desirable, 
and a prolonged period of negative cash flow can destroy your family’s 
budget. This form of risk tolerance has to be well managed in order for 
your investment to work. 
Managing each of these potential forms of risk requires planning on your 
part. 
Dealing with Tenants 
You reduce the risk involved in having to deal with tenants through proper 
selection and by checking credit and personal references. The majority of 
problems faced by landlords can be traced to lax procedures in checking 
references or misplaced trust. 

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 14 ]
Screening Tenants. If rental demand is high and stable, you will be able to 
select from among many applicants. When vacancies are low—5 percent or 
less—you may receive more than a hundred responses to a single newspaper 
ad. You need to get a written application from tenants. This is the first step 
in checking whether tenants can provide the basic information you need—
employment verification, current landlord’s name, a bank account 
reference, and monthly salary verified with copies of recent pay stubs. Use 
a form such as the one shown in Figure 1-1, and require all applicants to 
complete it. 
Some applicants will fail to fill out the form, meaning that they know they 
cannot refer you to their previous landlord, that they do not have a bank 
account, or that they have no income. Any of these problems disqualify the 
person based on even a cursory review. Therefore, simply requiring a written 
application is a necessary first step. 
KeY Point Look for applicants who have jobs, a current bank account, 
a local address, and a record of no evictions. You will discover that 
people lacking these important features will apply for your vacant rental, 
even though they have no reasonable expectation of making rent 
payments. Verification (including calling the person’s employer to confirm 
income) is essential. 
Checking References. The second step is checking all references. The 
importance of checking references—even when your instincts tell you that 
all is well—cannot be emphasized too much. Confirm the bank account to 
make sure it exists and is not currently overdrawn. Call both current and 
past landlords to determine whether they will provide positive 
recommendations. If the applicant does not provide you with both landlord 
references, or if they simply don’t have references to give you, that should 
disqualify them. For example, if an applicant claims to have been living with 
his parents, you have no reliable way to determine what kind of tenant he 
will be. Another potential problem is that the current landlord might be so 
motivated to get rid of the tenant that the reference will not be objective or 
accurate. This is why you also need to talk to a past landlord.
Also talk to the employer. Are the reported salary level and dates of 
employment accurate? You also want to make sure that the individual does 
in fact have the job and is in good standing. At this stage, you simply want 
to verify the information the applicant has provided to you. There is no way 
to ensure that employment will continue into the future, and this step is 
intended only for initial fact-checking.

If the applicant is self-employed, you cannot verify income in the same 
manner. You will need to get a copy of the person’s bank statement for the 
past two or three months to ensure that deposits are going into the bank. 
There is no reason to reject an application just because the applicant is 
self-employed, but, as with all forms of information, you need to be able to 
verify what you’re told on the application. 
Reviewing Credit History. You may want to collect a small fee from the 
applicant to run a credit check. The cost is usually about $15, although you 
will need to subscribe to a service and obtain written permission from the 
tenant applicant. If the would-be tenant does not provide all the information 
you need or is unable to give you verifiable references, look elsewhere. 
Checking Legal History. It is also easy in most states and counties to check 
legal history, since that information is a matter of public record. You can go 
to the clerk of a municipal or superior court and provide a name to be 
searched. From this search, you can discover—usually for no fee—whether 
a person has ever been evicted in that county or convicted of any crimes. 
Being Alert to Warning Signs. Some tenants cannot afford the rent you are 
asking. They may try to barter with you for part of the rent by “doing 
work around the place,” or by performing landscaping chores (which is 
their responsibility already in most cases), or by offering to paint the house. 
These are warning signals. You are probably not going to have a positive 
experience in hiring tenants in exchange for rent for any purpose. If the 
tenant cannot afford to pay the full amount of rent, the application should 
be rejected. 
Renting Month to Month. If you are unsure of how long you wish to rent to 
a specific tenant, offer a month-to-month arrangement rather than a lease. 
The month-to-month option protects you; if the tenant does not pay rent, it 
is easier to give notice under a month-to-month arrangement. Having a lease 
gives you a legal contract, but if the tenant is a deadbeat, it is unlikely that 
you will be able to collect what the person owes you. The month-to-month 
idea may make more sense. 
Using a Management Company. You could also hire a management company 
to deal with tenants directly. This service will cost you a percentage of rents 
collected, and some management companies are better than others. So, even 
if you hire a company, you need to check it out beforehand as well. Join a 
local landlords’ association, if there is one, and ask other members for 
referrals to local management companies. 

tHe nature of real estate inVesting 
[ 17 ]
Keeping an Eye on Market Value 
The best way to reduce the risk of stagnation in market value is with advance 
research. You should know your local market before you buy. That market 
includes the recent historical price trends for housing, as well as occupancy 
trends and market rent levels in rental housing. While current trends are not 
going to continue forever, you can certainly determine whether current 
conditions are strong or weak. You want to buy in a market where properties 
are available for attractive prices, but rental demand is high. This is the best 
of all conditions, especially if the cyclical supply and demand factors are timed 
in your favor. If real estate prices rise during the time you own the property, 
you benefit in several ways: from year-to-year tax benefits, tenant-paid 
mortgages, and positive cash flow. 
What should you do if and when the market softens? The property value 
itself may go through many cycles over the long term, so you may need to be 
patient and wait out the cycles. If employment in your city or town is strong 
and people are moving in instead of leaving the area, demand will continue to 
grow for real estate. If current building trends are exceeding demand but 
economic trends support long-term holding of your real estate, you may need 
to wait out the market. The situation is far different when the market for rental 
units goes soft. If there are more rentals in town than there are people wanting 
them, you could face a more immediate problem: the loss of rental income. If 
you believe your investment is not growing quickly enough, or if you experience 
higher than expected vacancies, you should keep open the possibility of selling. 
There is no sense in remaining invested in real estate or any other market if 
you are not experiencing strong cash flow and market value growth. 
Managing Cash Flow 
The real test of real estate investments is cash flow. You need to break even 
at the very least, when you take tax benefits into account. If you have high 
vacancies, you have to pay mortgage, insurance, taxes, utilities, and 
maintenance out of pocket, since these expenses are not being covered by 
rental income. With the tax benefits in place with fully occupied properties, 
you don’t need the tax write-off you get when properties are vacant. The 
solution to cash flow problems is based in careful research before you buy. 
Be sure you know the demand market for rentals, and pick properties whose 
mortgage payment, taxes, and interest can be covered through rental 
receipts. Also make sure that vacancies for rental properties are consistently 
low before you put money into rental investments. Negative cash flow is 
never a good thing, so you need to take steps to avoid finding yourself paying 
out more than you are bringing in. 

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 18 ]
RESEARCH AND ADVANCE PLANNING 
The nature of real estate investing includes many benefits as well as risk. 
Dealing with tenants, keeping an eye on market value, and managing cash 
flow are all easily handled when you select properties and tenants well. In 
each case, research and investigation will reduce or eliminate surprises, 
which you do not want once you have committed yourself to an investment. 
Always begin by selecting properties in strong, healthy markets—that is the 
essence of all types of investments. Stockbrokers should help you to pick 
stocks that rise consistently year after year. Similarly, real estate investors 
seek to invest in areas where market demand is strong, not only among 
potential buyers but also among prospective tenants.
Doing research ahead of time is a key first step if you are contemplating 
entering the real estate market. By avoiding problems before they arise, your 
experience will be both positive and profitable.

GETTING STARTED  
IN RENTAL PROPERTY 
INVESTING
T
here is no single way to invest in real estate. Just as the stock market 
offers a rich variety of methods for the flexible investor, real estate can 
also be approached in a number of ways. You can distinguish between types 
of property, for example, with each having its own supply and demand 
features. In some cases, one type of property will have very strong demand 
whereas another may be soft. For example, a large portion of the local 
population might consist of college students (creating a strong demand for 
multiunit rental housing), but at the same time, there might be very little 
retail trade or manufacturing in the area (causing a soft market for 
commercial and industrial property). 
Real estate, like the stock market, can be set up according to the type of 
investment you want and the level of risk you’re willing to accept. Every 
investment has attributes; these attributes define income opportunity as well 
as risk. Before deciding whether to invest in real estate, you should examine 
the positive and negative attributes in order to evaluate opportunity and 
risk—just as you would do with any form of investing. 
LOCATION, LOGISTICS, AND LIMITATION 
According to an old adage, the three most important attributes of real estate 
are location, location, and location. Actually, it might better be restated as 
location, logistics, and limitation. These are the three attributes that define 
whether real estate represents a sound investment. 

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 20 ]
1. Location, of course, is the central defining element of a “good” real estate 
investment. The vast difference in land values between 400 acres of Texas 
scrubland and a quarter acre in downtown Dallas makes this point. 
Whereas the scrubland is next to valueless, the location of the urban land 
creates a strong demand that drives up its value. 
2. Logistics is the second defining attribute. It does not matter how desirable 
land is in terms of its size, topography, and vegetation if it is not logistically 
viable as an investment. This means that you need basic services—roads, 
utilities, and access—to ensure that the land will grow in value. You 
cannot build a house in the middle of an area that does not have access 
to needed services. The logistics dictate that such a property is not a 
practical investment. 
3. Limitation is the third attribute that defines investment value. In areas 
such as Manhattan, San Francisco, and Tampa Bay, the proximity of land 
to water naturally limits how much development can occur. There is a 
finite amount of land. As a result, land becomes increasingly valuable as 
more demand for improvements comes into play. When the land has been 
fully developed, further construction has to move upward, or prices 
simply rise in response to the situation: The limitation of land means the 
supply is not enough to meet the demand, so land values rise. 
otHer considerations There are many additional aspects to 
real estate investing, of course. You also need to consider tax advantages, 
limitations on capital to invest, and the unavoidable aspect of dealing 
with tenants, lenders, and local economic changes that could lead to 
vacancies. Real estate investment requires careful planning. In turn, 
planning demands that investors understand how to keep accurate 
records, plan ahead for taxes, and make the right decisions today to 
protect the value of their investments, possibly for many years to come. 
FINANCIAL PLANNING 
The decision to become a real estate investor is usually made as part of a 
larger personal financial plan. Many considerations are involved: available 
capital, family income, comfort levels with owning real estate and carrying 
a large dollar amount of debt, other assets (stocks, retirement accounts, and 
savings, for example), and long-term goals. Once you decide that you 
want to include investment real estate in your financial plan, you also 

getting started in rental ProPertY inVesting 
[ 21 ]
accept the attributes that go along with your decision. The financial planning 
considerations include: 
 
Capital Limitations. If you have little or no money to invest, real estate will 
not be a serious prospective market for you. Because of the inherent risks 
of cash flow and debt financing, you will be in better shape when you 
have savings and adequate other investments available. Few people would 
seriously consider beginning a real estate investment plan without first 
establishing more liquid investments. 
As a practical matter, it is very difficult to begin a real estate investment 
plan before you have adequate capital resources. Whether those resources 
are acquired through inheritance, savings, sound investment strategies, or 
other means, they are essential. Some investors are unwilling to face the 
reality and to acknowledge the potential problems of getting into real estate 
before they are ready. The tendency is to limit the question to having enough 
cash for a down payment, but the problem of capital limitation is far more 
complex. If you don’t have any cash reserves or income available to cover a 
month or two of expenses when no rent is coming in, then the risks of 
rental real estate are too high. If you cannot qualify for a mortgage loan 
because you lack assets as well as a high enough level of income, then there 
is no point in pursuing creative alternatives to overcome the financial 
limitations. The risks are real. The best choice is to wait until you are better 
situated and put real estate aside for the moment. 
 
Family Income. You need to balance all investment programs with your 
personal income level. Of course, someone earning a very low monthly 
wage would not be able to qualify for the mortgage loans needed to begin 
a real estate investment program. Family income, if too low, would 
preclude your ability to qualify for loans. Of equal importance, when you 
live on a tight budget, you cannot afford to carry a large debt whose 
payments depend on rent payments by tenants. In that situation, two or 
three months’ vacancies could destroy the family budget. 
 
Outside Factors. As an example, a community whose revenue is derived 
largely from tourism may suffer big losses in retail trade due to national 
economic conditions, political turmoil, and other outside causes. The effect 
on commercial values, even if temporary, is very real. It’s even possible that 
commercial values could be more volatile than comparable values in 
communities that are more self-sustained. For example, an antique store 
located in Niagara Falls is likely to be more vulnerable to economic change 
than one carrying the same items in Omaha, Nebraska, or Philadelphia. 
 
Basis for Valuation. Another important difference in valuation between 
residential and commercial properties is the basis for valuation itself. 
Appraisal of residential property is usually done on the replacement or cost 

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 22 ]
basis. The appraiser finds comparably sized homes with similar features, 
located in similar neighborhoods, then makes needed adjustments to arrive 
at an approximation of value. However, commercial property valuation has 
to take different factors into account. A well-constructed building has little 
commercial value if a highway bypass keeps traffic away, whereas a poorly 
constructed, outdated building located right in the middle of vehicular and 
pedestrian traffic lanes will have a higher value than property located a few 
blocks away. 
KeY Point Investors in commercial property cannot depend on 
residential criteria for selection and valuation. They need to have, or to 
hire, expertise that can be used to set value based on income generation 
potential, local trends, and economic, political, or cyclical factors, if 
applicable, that will affect a property’s value. 
THE RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY MARKET
Residential property is usually the preferred starting point for investors. The 
commercial market, valuation of property, and demand features may be too 
complex (and the risk factors too high) for the beginning real estate investor. 
Most people more easily understand residential property. Buying a house or 
duplex as a starting point is often a more comfortable choice. 
iMPortant Assessing the demand features of real estate in terms of 
the need for rentals (versus the separate market controlling price trends 
in housing) is the key to selecting properties in the right place. 
Demand may vary within a single community, as well as from one area to 
another. Many tenants need to be close to public transportation and 
shopping. Students prefer to be close to their college or university. Elderly or 
low-income families prefer housing close to public facilities and local 
assistance offices. Consequently, properties in more remote areas of town 
may experience greater vacancies than those closer to the conveniences that 
the mix of tenants finds desirable.

[ 23 ]
The Many Aspects of Location 
Location is not limited to the city or town alone; it may also vary by 
proximity within a city or even within a fairly small town. Most experienced 
real estate investors have discovered that it is easier to pick properties wisely 
if they are intimately familiar with these subtle but important distinctions. 
Demand can be lower than average just because a specific property is a mile 
away from the closest bus line, school, or shopping center. A property that 
is well located in terms of conveniences is likely to remain occupied at a 
higher rate; when markets begin to soften, the better situated properties tend 
to stay occupied longer. In addition, location will also affect market rent 
levels, so that property will produce better cash flow as well. The point is 
that you may think of “location” as having several aspects. 
Regional. In the broadest sense, location refers to the region of the 
country—a specific city, town, or even a state. In fact, national statistics 
break down trends in residential real estate values by regions in that manner: 
Northeast, Midwest, Northwest, and so on. The broadly defined location is 
of little value in picking properties. Just as stock indexes reveal overall trends 
in the stock market, national and regional real estate trends provide an av-
erage view, but averages consist of strong and weak markets, collectively.
City to City. When we get down to more localized definitions of location, 
we can study real estate from city to city. If you have studied the market at 
all, you already know that values can and do vary significantly from town 
to town. Two cities, one next to the other, may have vastly different markets. 
One city may have consistently strong growth and property value trends, 
whereas the other is stagnant. Subtle differences in economic conditions or 
the political environment can make a big difference even when geography is 
not great. One city may be governed by a council that encourages employment 
and new housing, and its real estate market is likely to be robust. Another 
city may not encourage new employment or building, so that people move 
away and there is no reason to expect real estate prices to grow. A lack of 
demand—generated from employment growth and the related population 
growth—means there is no real market for housing, so there is no reason to 
expect growth at any time in the near future, either. 
Neighborhoods. Location can be even more finely defined. Within one city 
or town, certain areas are thought to be more desirable than others. Older, 
more established neighborhoods, those with their own grocery stores and 
other outlets, on quiet streets, will bring higher prices, and their market 
value will outpace the local averages. Homes located near highways, in 

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 24 ]
high-crime neighborhoods, or close to downtown congestion or noise are 
going to grow at a slower pace.
Individual Houses. In addition, you can look at two houses in the same 
neighborhood and see considerable differences in value. Consider two houses 
only one block apart: One house is on a very busy thoroughfare and directly 
across the street from a school. Every morning and afternoon, dozens of 
buses and cars fill the street. During the recess and lunch periods, you can 
hear the sounds of children playing. The older children walk by the house, 
so lawns often are littered. The second house is one block away from the 
school, as well as the noise, congestion, and littering problem. While both 
of these houses are identical, the second house—because it is one block 
removed from the problems—will grow in value faster than the one on the 
busy street in the school zone. 
Other Houses in the Area. The houses next to the house you’re thinking of 
buying also affect value. If they are well maintained and the neighborhood 
has a consistently high level of cosmetic maintenance, then your house will 
benefit. By the same argument, if neighbors do not care for their properties, 
they will hold down value in your investment property. 
Owner-occupied housing tends to increase in value more than rental 
properties. With this in mind, it is strategically wise to invest in single-family 
properties in largely owner-occupied areas. That factor, a subtle interpretation 
of “location,” will help maintain your property’s value in line with the larger 
neighborhood trend. As long as you keep your property in good shape, it is 
likely to grow in conformity with other homes. In comparison, if you buy a 
property in an area characterized by other rentals, market growth is likely 
to be lower than it would be in neighborhoods with a majority of owner- 
occupied houses. 
KeY Point  The location factor cannot be overlooked in the property 
study. It determines the ultimate value of the investment. Just as one 
stock will outperform other stocks in the same business sector for a 
variety of specific reasons, one house will perform better for you because 
of its location, condition, and neighborhood.
These observations are general rules of thumb. They do not dictate all 
markets, and you will find that every situation is unique. Real estate is truly 
a local investment that is affected not by national averages but by what is 
going on right there in town: employment, population demographics and 

getting started in rental ProPertY inVesting 
[ 25 ]
trends, crime levels, transportation, shopping, and condition of the property 
and neighborhood. All of these factors affect long-term investment value, 
rental demand, and the likely occupancy and vacancy rates. 
DIRECT OWNERSHIP OF RENTAL PROPERTY 
The best known and most popular form of real estate investment is direct 
ownership. This normally involves financing the major portion of the 
purchase and paying the mortgage with rental income. This traditional 
approach is appealing to most investors—as long as rents continue to cover 
the cash flow demands—because it also involves favorable tax benefits (see 
Chapter 9). 
Lenders are likely to apply much higher standards when you invest than 
when you buy a home and occupy it yourself. These standards apply to credit 
history, income, down payment requirements, and debt-to-value ratio. When 
you buy your own home, you can normally finance 90 percent of the 
purchase price and sometimes even more. Veteran’s Administration (VA) and 
Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans, for example, often allow you 
to finance practically the entire purchase price. For nonoccupied housing or 
for commercial property, you may be required to pay a higher interest rate 
and come up with a higher down payment as well. 
Advantages of Direct Control 
While there are other ways to invest money in real estate, direct ownership 
has the greatest appeal. Stockholders own equity in a public company, but 
they have no real control. The ownership of a small fraction of stock provides 
the potential for appreciation in market value and dividend income, and 
stockholders have the right to vote on certain decisions, but they have no say 
in the day-to-day operations of the corporation. In comparison, when you 
own rental property, you do have direct control. You maintain the house by 
keeping the roof, landscaping, and internal systems in good repair; by 
selecting and paying for responsible homeowner’s insurance; and by keeping 
an eye on the property itself. You determine whether to paint the house a 
different color, add structural improvements, or refinance the mortgage to 
take out equity. In other words, the management of the investment is in your 
hands. For the purpose of market value, appreciation depends to an extent 
on local supply and demand as well as on the three Ls (location, logistics, 
limitations). Yet, to an equal degree, the value of the investment also depends 
on your individual effort in keeping the property in good shape, well 
maintained, and properly cared for. 

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 26 ]
Handling Problems 
For a real estate investor, direct control also means that you need to deal 
with both expected and unexpected problems as they arise. The mortgage 
payment has to be made on time every month, even if your tenant does not 
pay rent or, equally troubling, if your property is vacant. The heating system 
breaks down, the roof begins to leak, or you discover an infestation of 
termites or ants. All of these expensive problems—none of which will be 
covered by your insurance—cannot be planned for, but they all occur. If you 
own your own home, you already know that maintenance never ends; it only 
pauses for a few months. 
build a reserVe  When you invest in rental property, you want 
rental income to be consistent and adequate to cover your mortgage 
payment—and it is wise also to establish a reserve fund for repairs. 
Minimizing Maintenance 
If you purchase a newly built home to use as an income property, you should 
not experience any expensive repairs for several years. Properties go through 
maintenance cycles, and the first cycle tends to arrive about seven years after 
a house is built. To avoid the more expensive repairs, then, you could buy 
new homes and sell them after six years. Of course, this is not always a 
practical strategy. It may not be possible to afford new homes for investment, 
especially if older homes in your area are available for less money. You also 
cannot control the real estate cycle. Demand for housing could be low in six 
years when you would like to sell. You cannot control supply and demand, 
so the plan of timing investments to avoid unexpected maintenance costs is 
probably not practical. 
Choosing Properties Carefully 
On balance, the advantages of direct control outweigh the problems if you 
select properties carefully. This requires that you inspect the properties and 
critically check their condition. For older homes especially, it is worth requiring 
an independent home inspection as part of the buying process. A qualified and 
independent inspector prepares a written report and has to disclose the 
condition of all systems in the property. If maintenance is needed, you can 
require it to be performed as a condition of buying the property. This protects 

getting started in rental ProPertY inVesting 
[ 27 ]
you from the shock of unknown and expensive repairs you’d otherwise need 
to perform only a few months after you buy the property. 
Valuable resource  The American Society of Home Inspectors 
(ASHI) licenses individuals to perform professional home inspections and 
to guarantee their findings. To locate a licensed inspector, contact ASHI 
online at http://www.homeinspector.org.
Once you have ensured that properties do not have any hidden flaws, you are 
able to eliminate the potential problem of buying properties only to discover 
too late that they need extensive and costly repairs. A home inspection reduces 
your risk, at least in the immediate future. However, properties need ongoing 
maintenance, and this fact should be considered in evaluating the entire idea 
of investing in rental properties, especially for the long term. 
FINANCING YOUR RENTAL INVESTMENT 
Few people have enough cash available to buy properties outright, so they 
have to borrow the money, which means they purchase rental real estate 
with a mortgage. The selection of a competitive mortgage and terms will 
determine the long-term cost because a fractional change in interest adds up 
over the years. Here are some guidelines worth remembering when you 
finance or refinance your investment property, as compared to the same 
rules for your residence: 
 
Lenders apply a different standard to investor qualification. Homeowners with 
excellent credit and strong income can usually find attractive terms—low 
rates and low down payments. However, when you buy investment 
property, you are expected to pay a higher interest rate. Since the property 
will not be owner occupied, lenders will view the mortgage loan as having 
greater risks. 
 
Down payment requirements may be higher. Lenders usually expect investors 
to put more down for their properties than they would ask of homeowners. 
For example, you might be able to locate an 80 percent or 90 percent loan 
for your own home (and sometimes even 100 percent). With rental 
property, some lenders are going to demand 30 percent as a down 
payment. As a general rule, if lenders will grant a mortgage for less down, 
they will also expect a higher interest rate. 

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 28 ]
 
You may need to seek nonconventional financing sources. You may find the best 
rates by shopping online for a mortgage. A simple Internet search under 
“mortgage” will reveal dozens of sources for mortgage loans, with 
competitive rates. You can narrow down the market for nonowner-occupied 
financing, but even then you will find that the traditional sources often 
exclude you if you want to borrow money for rental investments. You may 
consider private sources or even look for seller financing. (Be careful, 
however. A seller who offers to carry the loan could mean the property 
has defects that need to be fixed. Such defects would become your problem 
if you buy the property.) 
 
You may not be allowed to remove cash upon refinancing. Typically, homeowners 
can refinance their loans when rates go down and even take out cash 
because their equity has increased. With rental real estate, many lenders 
will not allow you to remove cash upon refinancing, even if the equity is 
there. This more conservative policy reflects the perception that 
nonowner-occupied property presents greater risks for lenders. 
 
It will be more difficult to find lines of credit. Homeowners can find equity 
lines of credit, which are excellent alternatives to refinancing. They can 
draw on the credit when they need to, borrowing only as much as they 
need and then paying down the debt when they can afford to. In fact, 
some lenders allow homeowners to take out an equity line of credit up to 
100 percent of their equity and, in some instances, even more. For 
investors, however, it is more difficult. Most conventional lenders restrict 
their lines of credit only to owner-occupied housing. You may be able to 
find such a line of credit, but it will require some research. 
Comparing Owner-Occupied and  
Investment Financing
Qualifying for a mortgage, even for an owner-occupied primary residence, 
is not always well understood. When considering the same questions for 
investment property, the confusion tends to increase.
Credit is a primary consideration for any type of mortgage. As a basic 
requirement to qualify for a loan, your credit history is normally the first 
issue a would-be lender is going to tackle. It’s logical. A lender wants to 
analyze the probability of getting paid on time every month, and credit 
history reflects the borrower’s level of credit responsibility. It is fair to say 
that an excellent credit history is essential for a real estate investor and that 
a poor credit history makes the venture impractical. Most lenders want to 

getting started in rental ProPertY inVesting 
[ 29 ]
see a positive credit score, perhaps above 725 to 750; any score above 800 is 
excellent. A score below 600 presents problems for lenders and, as a 
consequence, for investors as well.
The credit score is developed from the history of on-time or late payments; 
outstanding judgments and items that have gone to collection; past defaults 
on loans; and any negative items reported. A single late payment, for 
example, can be explained away or seen as an exception. Two or more late 
payments indicates a more serious problem.
Down payment is a second item the lender wants to consider. For 
owner-occupied houses, the down payment for an FHA loan is 3.5 percent 
in most cases; a VA loan may be obtained with zero down. However, the 
lower the down payment, the higher monthly payments will be, so borrowers 
with a large down payment are better risks for lenders. Conventional loans 
may require as much as 10 percent down.
For investment property, expect to be required to come up with a 20 
percent down payment. So a house priced at $150,000 will require a down 
payment of $30,000.
Financial tests of income and debt are the third and equally important test 
for qualification. Lenders look at the debt-to-income (DTI) ratio. This is 
calculated as your monthly expenses, including the proposed mortgage, as a 
percentage of your gross monthly income. If your DTI is higher than 50 
percent, you probably will not qualify for the loan.
Understanding Lending Rule Restrictions 
Rules for conventional financing are restrictive because lenders themselves 
have to meet specific rules. Most loans are not kept by the original lender 
but are resold to the secondary market. Even if lenders continue to service a 
loan (i.e., collecting payments and impounds, the periodic increments taken 
for property taxes and insurance), the debt itself usually ends up being sold 
to an organization such as the Government National Mortgage Association 
(GNMA), also known as Ginnie Mae, or the Federal National Mortgage 
Association (FNMA), or Fannie Mae. Mortgages are pooled, and shares are 
then sold to investors. 
With this secondary market dictating terms for mortgage loans, it is not 
always up to the lender whether to grant your loan. If the lender intends to 
sell your mortgage debt on the secondary market (which commonly occurs), 
the specific terms imposed by that market have to be met. These terms relate 
to credit rating, interest rate, down payment, type of property, and DTI. 

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 30 ]
KeY Point  The lowest risk—from a lender’s point of view—is a loan 
granted on an owner-occupied house, with a large down payment, and 
with a borrower whose credit is excellent. Not everyone meets all of these 
conditions, so varying degrees of approval are possible. The higher the 
risk, the higher the interest rate will be, and the more down payment 
you’ll be required to deposit. 
Investors will have more difficulty than for owner-occupied housing. 
Whenever your equity in the property is less than 20 percent, you are going 
to be required to carry a form of mortgage insurance designed to pay the 
lender in case you default. So, even though you are required to make a 
larger down payment, you also escape having to pay expensive insurance 
in addition to the fire and casualty insurance you have to carry on the 
property.
Starting with Your Primary Residence 
Some investors have figured out that they can simplify the approval process 
by getting loans on their primary residence rather than trying to meet the 
higher standards of investment property. For example, if you currently live 
in a house and you’d like to begin an investment program, one solution is to 
locate a new primary residence and go for financing based on your plans to 
move into the new property. As soon as the transaction is complete, you 
move into the new home and convert your current residence into a rental. 
You will be able to continue making the same mortgage payments on your 
current home (which was financed originally based on your occupying the 
property as your primary residence) and rent the property out. 
It is possible to accumulate a series of rental properties by simply moving 
into a series of new owner-occupied homes as the timing and your own 
financial situation dictate. The only requirement on the part of conventional 
lenders is that the property being financed must be your primary residence 
at the time the loan is approved. In theory, you could change your mind the 
day after the loan was approved and convert the new property to a rental. 
But this could be interpreted as making a false claim on your loan application. 
It is safer and wiser to move into the new home and convert your current 
primary residence to a rental as a bona fide change of status, even if only for 
a few months. 
The decision to treat a specific property as a rental or as your primary 
residence should be based on practical considerations. If you ask your family 
to move to a property that is poorly located, too small for your needs, or too 

getting started in rental ProPertY inVesting 
[ 31 ]
uncomfortable, then you are risking personal dissatisfaction and conflict at 
home. One advantage of moving to a series of acquired new homes is that 
you apply the same standards to rentals that you apply to your own home. 
If you have maintained your current primary residence well, it will be a 
pleasant place to live; a tenant will be willing to pay a reasonable level of 
rent based on how well you have cared for the property. 
iMPortant  The suggestion that investors can perpetually finance 
properties as primary residences and move from one property to another 
should be viewed cautiously. You should plan to actually move into the 
new property in order to avoid being accused of misleading your lender. 
Once you have completed the transaction, the lender will be satisfied, 
especially if you continue making timely mortgage payments. When you 
are established in the new property and you convert your previous 
residence to a rental, the lender on that home will not care whether you 
live there—as long as you keep the property insured and as long as the 
payments continue to arrive on time. 
Getting the Best Deal 
As a general rule, expect to do more work and meet a higher standard to 
finance your real estate investment. At the same time, also shop for the best 
possible deal. Look for a loan with the lowest possible up-front costs. Loan 
origination fees (points) are charged as an alternative to higher interest rates. 
A point is equal to 1 percent of the loan. 
For example, if you are borrowing $100,000, each point will cost you 
$1,000. That can add up and makes a comparison between two loans more 
difficult. If one lender charges 6 percent and no points, and another charges 
5 percent and three points, which is cheaper? The only way to make a valid 
comparison is to calculate the overall interest payments over the terms of the 
loan, plus points. This is an easy calculation involving three steps: 
1. Multiply the monthly payment by the number of months in the 
loan term. 
2. Subtract the amount being borrowed. (The remaining dollar 
amount is total interest.) 
3. Add the points the lender wants to charge you. 
The result is overall interest. Once it is calculated, you can determine 
whether one loan is going to be a better—or worse—deal than another. 

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 32 ]
When you study the overall interest expense of mortgaging a property, 
you realize that the cost of investment is not limited to the sales price. You 
will pay far more in interest over thirty years than the original price of the 
property. So investigating beforehand and finding the best deal is more 
important than finding a house that costs a few thousand dollars less. Basing 
the comparison on overall costs, you can save more money by finding the 
best interest rate deal than you would in trying to save a few dollars on the 
purchase price. If you get a “good deal” in your price but pay too much for 
interest, you will spend more in the long run. 
KeY Point You must make your mortgage payments whether you have 
paying tenants or not. You can readily see that vacancies—especially 
long-term vacancies—could be a big problem. The “cash flow risk” of real 
estate is significant unless you are able to locate a market in which 
vacancies are extremely low (less than 5 percent on average). Before 
deciding to become a real estate investor, research the local market in 
terms of prices, rental demand, and the current pattern of value appreciation.
INVESTING IN RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE 
Why is residential property the most popular form of real estate investment? 
There is more demand for this type of property than for any other as an 
investment. Of course, the American Dream is home ownership, so the 
majority of today’s tenants would like to buy a home one day. 
Single-Family Homes 
This desire for home ownership helps to strengthen the market value of 
single-family rental investments. The home you rent out today will be 
someone else’s primary residence at some point in the future. 
The single-family home is also desirable because tenants who can afford 
the rent can have a yard and garden; it is a better environment for children 
than apartment living; and if the landlord allows it, they can have a pet. 
note If rental demand is relatively low in your area, allowing tenants 
with a cat or a small dog could push your property to the top of the list—
especially if the majority of housing forbids pets.

Real estate has increased consistently in market value over many years, with 
the notable exception between 2009 and 2011 when property values 
declined. Since then, prices have come back strongly. The challenge for a real 
estate investor is to judge both cash flow and the likely bottoming out in 
market values. National averages show the long-term trends in prices of new 
homes. Figure 2-1 summarizes the growth rates since 1989.

Note that these are averages. There is no guarantee that prices are going to 
go up everywhere or at the same rate. But if you (a) research the market 
before you buy, (b) conclude that the market is strong and growing, and (c) 
select properties carefully, the odds are vastly improved that the investment 
will be sensible and well timed. Real estate value increases over time even 
with cyclical declines, and it combines the best features of taxation, risk, and

market value.Since all real estate is local (meaning national averages don’t 
apply everywhere), it is instructive to compare housing trends by region. 
Figure 2-2 shows the average sales price of existing homes in four major 
regions. This chart reveals how broadly defined regions are different from 
one another. Every region’s prices grew over the three years between 2013 
and 2015, but average prices were quite dissimilar.
For real estate investors, the implications are clear. As the first illustration 
revealed, the average decline in housing prices was quite short-term, and 
prices continued rising soon after the decline from 2008 to 2011, to even 
higher historical price levels. The second illustration shows that average 
prices vary considerably, depending on where you live. When the analysis is 
taken down to the local level (city or county), the differences are likely to be 
even more noticeable.

At the same time that prices declined and then rose once again, the trend 
in average market rents presented an interesting contrast to housing costs. See 
Figure 2-3. Average rents followed the direction of the overall housing markets 
by declining between 2008 and 2011 but rose strongly from 2011 onward. 
The underlying causes for rental increases occurred for reasons different 
from the reasons for the growth in housing values. Since 2008, a growing 
number of people who would have been likely home buyers in the past chose 
to rent, out of concern about the possibility of home prices continuing to 
decline. This wait-and-see attitude placed increased demand for rentals, as 
shown in Figure 2-4.

[ 36 ]
This summary reveals a steady decline in the percentage of home 
ownership. The longer-term trend showed the opposite—home ownership 
rates growing steadily between 1995 and 2005. If you are considering 
entering the real estate rental market, these statistics demonstrate that the 
timing is ideal. The market value of property is rising, and at the same time, 
market rents are also on the rise even as home ownership rates have been 
declining for over a decade.
MORTGAGES FOR REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT
Another factor encouraging for real estate investment is the historically low 
rate of interest. Unlike the double-digit rates of the past, today’s housing 
interest rate is in the low single digits as of 2016. However, credit has also 
been tightened.
Today, investors have to be prepared to put down 20 percent or more to 
ensure that a mortgage will be granted. This also removes the requirement for 
expensive mortgage insurance and often will result in a lower interest rate.
A significant down payment is virtually a requirement, along with a 
strong credit history. Loans can be looked for in many places, and large 
banks often are the worst place to start. A local or regional bank is likely to 
be more flexible and have less red tape, even though they work in the same 
system with a majority of loans sold to the secondary market.
If you have poor credit or lack enough cash for a 20 percent or higher 
down payment, consider seeking owner financing. There is the possibility 
that a current owner who is motivated enough to find a new buyer may 
carry some or all of the debt. This is not always easy because most sellers 
would prefer to cash out. But if you seek finance from a traditional lender, 
getting the current owner to carry a second mortgage lowers the lender’s 
risk and makes the overall deal more feasible, even if your credit history is 
not perfect.
A restriction on mortgages for investors also relates to the number of 
rentals you are allowed to finance. As a general rule, you cannot have more 
than four rental properties with mortgages. Most lenders draw the line at 
that level. Two qualifications may enable you to mortgage a fifth or sixth 
investment property. First, look for houses costing less than you can afford. 
Having a cushion helps you to get approval beyond four properties. Second, 
it means a lot if you have owned your four properties for more than one year, 
especially if your mortgage payments have all been made on time. 
Some investors will be interested in properties other than single-family 
homes, even though this is by far the most popular choice. However, some 
alternatives deserve consideration as well.

[ 37 ]
Mobile Homes. Mobile homes are an alternative form of investment. 
However, they are not really comparable to permanent housing. Mobile 
homes, by definition, are personal property and not real property. If you 
invest in a mobile home, its value is going to decline over the time you own 
it, just as a car’s value declines. If you buy the land where the mobile home 
is situated, it is possible that land values will grow. Some investors have 
discovered this as an alternative to buying more expensive houses. They 
buy the land and then place a mobile home on it, renting it out. Over a 
period of years, the payments for both land and mobile home are covered 
by rent. Ultimately, the investor owns the land free and clear and can either 
continue renting out the mobile home or sell it and use the land for other 
purposes—to build a permanent home or sell the land at a profit, for 
example. 
Condominiums. Another way to go is to purchase a condominium unit and 
rent it out. A condo might seem cheaper at first glance, but it could end up 
being more expensive than direct ownership. When monthly association fees 
are added to your mortgage payment, the overall expense adds up to much 
more than it would be to simply buy a home. Using a loan payment table, 
find the total payment, and you will see what you could have afforded if you 
had purchased a single-family home. The total of payments would buy much 
more house than you could afford paying mortgage plus fees for the condo. 
Co-ops. Finally, a cooperative unit might be convertible to a rental. However, 
co-op owner associations tend to be more restrictive than typical condo or 
planned-unit associations. The rules of the co-op housing association might 
prevent you from renting out your unit. So you need to check the sublet 
policy before buying a co-op. 
KeY Point Condos and co-ops have historically grown in value, but 
they have not kept pace with the rate of growth in single-family housing. 
For most first-time investors, the single-family home is by far the best 
and safest method for getting into real estate investing for the first time. 
Multiple-Unit Housing 
A two- or three-unit building is similar to a single-family house because it 
may also have a yard and other homelike features. At the same time, it 
shares features with apartments, such as lower rents than single-family 
housing, shared utility costs, and less privacy. So there are trade-offs among 
the different types of housing. 

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 38 ]
From the investment point of view, a duplex or triplex is likely to produce 
far better cash flow than single-family housing yet still attract tenants who 
want some of the features associated with a house as opposed to an 
apartment. Many tenants express a desire to have a garden, for example. 
(Some never get around to planting anything, but if they have been living in 
an apartment, they see houses or duplexes as providing them more flexibility.) 
For people who cannot afford to buy a house, renting a duplex or triplex 
is a reasonable compromise. These units are affordable (rents are usually 
more than for an apartment but less than a house) yet offer many features 
of home ownership. In a market with varying or weakening demand, duplex 
or triplex units are likely to have less vacancy than apartments (because of 
the desirable features they provide) or single-family housing (because of the 
higher cost of renting the entire house). 
TWO ESSENTIAL FACTORS TO CONSIDER 
When you begin comparing one type of housing to another, you need to keep 
two separate investment considerations in mind. First is the long-term 
market value of the investment itself, and second is the more immediate 
rental demand and cash flow question. 
Long-Term Property Values 
How will your rental increase in value over time? Based on historical 
averages, single-family housing tends to increase in value more than 
multifamily units and other types of rental properties. Single-family houses 
are likely to be the most profitable long-term investment based on the 
averages. 
If properties are growing in value in your area, buying single-family 
rentals makes sense. You pay your costs by collecting rents, and you can wait 
out the market. When values are far higher than they are today, you can sell 
at a profit. Whereas rents tend to increase over time due to local cost-of-living 
trends, your mortgage cost is fixed (if you obtain a fixed-rate loan) or the 
costs are limited (in a variable-rate loan, the rate cap will limit the interest 
rate increases over time). So as a long-term investment, single-family houses 
are likely to increase in value more favorably than other properties. 
Most of the payments in a mortgage go to interest in the early years. A 
thirty-year mortgage, for example, is only half paid by the twenty-fourth 
year; the other half gets paid off more rapidly in the last six years. At first 
glance, this looks like bad news. How can your investment appreciate if you 
are paying so little to decrease the mortgage debt? 

getting started in rental ProPertY inVesting 
[ 39 ]
As a homeowner, the argument does apply. You gain very little in equity 
from paying down your loan during the first few years you own your home. 
The average homeowner moves within five years from the time of purchasing 
a first home, so almost no equity is accumulated through payments. As an 
investor, you have to keep three points in mind: 
1. You claim interest expense as a deduction on your tax return. As an investor, 
you are allowed to deduct all of your interest as an expense—in addition 
to property taxes, utilities, depreciation, and other expenses. So payments 
of interest shelter rental income and produce net losses rather than 
taxable gains. The deduction of interest is an attractive benefit, effectively 
reducing your “real cost” of the mortgage. For example, if your combined 
federal and state effective tax rate is 40 percent, then an $800 monthly 
interest expense is reduced to $480 after taxes (because you reduce your 
personal tax liability by $320, or 40 percent of the total interest expense). 
2. Mortgage payments are made for you by tenants. Even though you collect 
rents and then make your own mortgage payment, you can look at the 
situation a little differently: Rent receipts are used to pay your mortgage 
payment. In this regard, the fact that most of your payment goes to 
interest does not really matter because it is paid for you. In practical 
terms, you are always better off paying less interest, meaning your loan 
gets paid down more rapidly and your cash flow improves. However, 
with the offset between interest expense and rental income, the high cost 
of borrowing money is not as much of an issue as it would be without that 
income. 
3. Appreciation occurs from market price changes. It is a mistake to assume 
that you accumulate equity only by paying down your mortgage loan. In 
fact, there is far more appreciation potential in market value growth. In 
some areas, that growth has been extraordinary, with multiple-year, 
double-digit growth in market prices of homes. In other areas, prices 
move more slowly or, in some cases, fall. Well-selected real estate is going 
to grow in value as long as the local economy is vibrant and jobs are 
available so that people are moving in instead of moving out. The longer 
you hold investment property in these circumstances, the greater the 
market appreciation is likely to be. 
Vacancies in Rentals 
Growth in market value has been impressive historically. However, the 
second investment consideration—rental demand—could be far more 
important in the month-to-month evaluation of your investment properties. 
You want to acquire properties that will pay for themselves in terms of rental 

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 40 ]
income versus mortgage payments, property taxes, insurance, utilities, and 
other expenses. If you cannot make cash flow work, you will have an 
unending cash flow problem. A vacancy for a few months will have a similar 
negative impact on your personal finances, so cash flow risk is a serious 
matter for every real estate investor. This is why the question of cash flow 
(see Chapter 3) should be more important than long-term market value. 
Vacancy Rates. Real estate investors are keenly aware that vacancy rates 
affect their ability to make the investment program work. If you have 
chronic vacancies, it means that you are asking too much in rent or that 
the area has more supply than demand. This is a troubling problem because 
it makes real estate investing far less practical. Unless you can afford to 
carry the mortgage debt without a full year’s rental income, you could be 
in big trouble. The more properties you own, the more severe the vacancy 
problem would become. 
KeY Point Before beginning your investment plan, investigate 
vacancy trends. Also look at current and planned new construction. If 
hundreds of new apartment or modest housing units are going to be built 
during the next year or two, what does that mean for the prospect of 
vacancies? The threat has to be taken seriously, especially if vacancies 
are already high in your city or town. 
To investigate trends in vacancy, check with a real estate broker or loan 
officer at your bank. Both have access to updated information about housing 
and should know the current vacancy rates. More important, they have 
statistics on rental and vacancy trends, including average rents, for housing 
of certain sizes and features, often broken down by neighborhood. The trend 
is important because you can track how the situation is changing over time. 
For example, if vacancy rates have been low but have increased lately, 
what is the cause? Are more units being built, or are people moving away? 
How does the vacancy rate compare with the local employment rate? These 
are critical questions that define whether the timing for starting a real estate 
investment plan is good or bad. The real estate agent, whether using local 
Multiple Listing Service (MLS) data or consulting with an in-house rental 
specialist, should be able to advise you on the significance of the trend. 
What if vacancy rates are low or decreasing? At first glance, this would 
seem to indicate a positive environment for you to begin buying rental 
housing. However, it is wise to check with your planning department and 

getting started in rental ProPertY inVesting 
[ 41 ]
local economic or community groups and investigate the situation a little 
further. Are new construction plans going to change the picture? Are new 
employers coming to town, or are established employers closing up shop and 
going elsewhere? A sudden, large layoff and resulting unemployment can 
turn a good historical vacancy trend into a disaster. So while you need to 
have a grasp on what is occurring in local building, you also need to be 
informed about employment and population statistics. 
Additional help in getting statistics for real estate vacancy trends can be 
found in a local landlords’ association, if there is one in your community. 
Also, check with the chamber of commerce and any local tenants’ 
organizations or rental referral services. (Incidentally, if you register with 
referral services, you will get many free tenant referrals, as an alternative to 
paying for an ad in your local paper.) The tenant referral service makes its 
money by charging people a fee in exchange for a list of local apartments 
and houses available for rent. These agencies have a very good idea of 
vacancy levels because they experience both supply and demand and are 
aware when one side or the other moves. 
Cash Flow vs. Investment Value. Cash flow is definitely affected by the 
vacancy rate. The “market” is not a singular concept. It includes the housing 
value market, or the prices people pay for homes. It also includes the demand 
for housing units, which operates on separate assumptions and does not 
always move in the same direction as housing prices. With this in mind, the 
compromise of investing in a duplex or triplex could make sense. Even 
though the long-term market value for these multiunit properties may not be 
as healthy as that for single-family houses, the cash flow will be far more 
favorable. You also spread your cash flow risk. For example, if a triplex has 
one vacancy this month, you continue to collect rent on the remaining two 
units. Depending on the relationship between rent and cost, this can make 
a huge difference in your cash flow. A vacancy in a single-family house is 
always a 100 percent vacancy. In a duplex, a single vacancy takes 50 percent 
of your monthly rental income, and in a triplex, a single vacancy is only 
one-third of total income. 
The balance between long-term investment value and immediate cash 
flow requirements has to be considered before you buy a property. While 
both of these issues are important, they often contradict one another. If you 
believe you can afford to live with the risk of vacancies in a single-family 
home, you can create a more profitable long-term investment. But if that risk 
would be too much for your monthly budget, you are better off compromising 
by accepting a potentially more modest long-term profit in exchange for 
more certainty in immediate cash flow.

PART-YEAR RENTALS AND VACATION HOMES 
Many people who own two properties rent out their homes while they live 
in their secondary location. From a record-keeping perspective, this situation 
presents some potential problems. These issues can be solved with careful 
and thorough documentation based on a logical division between personal 
use and rental use. The records need to reflect how you make these divisions, 
so that you can support what you report on your tax return. Because many 
expenses that are deductible for investment properties are not deductible for 
your home, you need to be able to divide those expenses between rental and 
personal use. Even expenses that are deductible—such as mortgage interest 
and property taxes—are reported separately. For the time you use a property 
as a rental, these expenses are reported as part of your investment income 
or loss. For the time you use the property as your home, the expenses are 
reported as itemized deductions. 
Dividing Your Expenses 
The most reliable and accurate way to divide these expenses is on the basis 
of the number of days a property is used during the year for each purpose. 
The exact number of days you live in a property would count as residential. 
The remainder of the year would be assigned to treatment as a rental 
property. 
note Even if the property is vacant for part of the remainder of the 
year, the applicable expenses (e.g., utilities, insurance, taxes, interest) 
are deductible as rental expenses—as long as the property is available 
to rent. The calculation should be based on the actual days you use the 
property as your residence versus the full year—and the time the property 
is available as a rental. 
Vacation Homes 
Under federal rules, you are allowed to claim itemized deductions for your 
primary residence as well as for a second home. Besides applying to a home 
used partly as a residence and partly as a rental, the rule also extends to 
vacation homes. By definition, a vacation home is a second property that you 
use for only part of the year. If you do not rent out your vacation home at 
all, then the property taxes and interest are claimed as itemized deductions. 

getting started in rental ProPertY inVesting 
[ 43 ]
However, if you rent out your vacation home, then you can claim deductions 
as rental expense for property taxes and interest, as well as for insurance, 
utilities, and other expenses. 
tWo iMPortant Qualifications First, any property taxes 
and interest claimed as rental expense have to be deducted from the 
amount you report as itemized deductions. Second, you can deduct 
rental expenses only for the portion of the year that your vacation home 
is available as a rental
Making the House Available for Rent 
The period in which you are allowed to claim rental expenses is not 
automatically the whole time you do not use the house yourself. It has to 
be available as a rental in order for you to properly claim a rental expense. 
Even if you don’t have a tenant for the entire time, you must be able to 
show that the property was available. The best way to establish that it was 
available for rent is by keeping copies of online ads you place to try to find 
tenants. To document your claim that a rental was available, be sure to list 
in the ad the exact dates you want to rent out the property. As long as you 
can establish availability, and as long as you do not use the property during 
the same period, expenses for a vacation home can be deducted as rental 
expenses. 
If you make the property available for rent only three months of the year 
and live in it for only three months, what happens to the remaining six 
months? Because it is available to rent for only three months, you would be 
allowed to claim a deduction of only one-fourth of total expenses (or actual 
expenses occurring during the period the property was available for rent). 
The remaining nine months would be assigned as personal expenses, so you 
would be allowed to claim three-fourths of property taxes and interest as 
itemized deductions. 
These distinctions are important because you are allowed to deduct 
additional expenses while the property is available as a rental. Those 
expenses—which include utilities, insurance, and depreciation—are not 
deductible as itemized deductions. So, from a tax standpoint, the longer 
the period of time a second home is available as a rental, the greater the 
advantage. 

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 44 ]
The Logistics of a Part-Time Rental 
Equally important, you should think about some of the logistics involved 
with the use of property as a part-time rental. Vacation homes often are 
located far from your primary residence, perhaps hundreds of miles away. 
As a general observation, the farther you live from your rental property, the 
more difficult it will be to manage it and to work with tenants. Even a 
relatively minor repair, for example, is easy to take care of if you live a few 
blocks from your rental; you may even choose to do the work yourself. But 
when the same repair has to be done on a house far from where you live, it 
is more complicated. You have to trust the tenant’s description of the 
problem. You also have to either hire someone you trust to perform the 
repair or allow the tenant to find someone. In other words, you have less 
control over the situation. 
The timing of a changeover from rental to personal use is another potential 
problem area to keep in mind. For example, if you want to rent out the 
property from September through May but use it yourself for the months 
from June through August, you must find a tenant willing to agree to that 
schedule. This means there is a chance you won’t be able to keep the property 
occupied for all the months you want to rent it out. You might also discover 
that tenants don’t want to leave even if they have agreed to a month-to-month 
situation. 
KeY Point Potential logistics and timing problems don’t make it 
inadvisable to use properties for dual purposes. They only require more 
planning and, possibly, greater expense as well. If the alternative is to 
simply leave a property vacant most of the year, then you lose the rental 
income, which is not a practical alternative. 
Renting Out Part of Your House 
If you rent out part of your house, you face different potential problems. 
Because you and your tenant will be sharing common areas, you will want 
to be compatible in order for the arrangement to work. A rental that is 
self-contained, with its own entrance but located on the same lot, simplifies 
the issue. However, many landlords discover that it is not advantageous to 
have tenants living so close by because they tend to require higher 
maintenance, another potential problem to consider. Even so, having a 
tenant residing in an in-law unit—or, as it is called in some places, an addi-
tional dwelling unit (ADU)—can make the difference between your home 

getting started in rental ProPertY inVesting 
[ 45 ]
being affordable or not. Rental income relieves your mortgage burden while 
providing tax benefits. 
KeY Point The part-time rental or shared rental arrangement helps 
many people to afford their mortgage, reduce monthly home maintenance 
expenses, and ease into rental investments in an affordable and practical 
way. Planning ahead and thoroughly screening tenants are the keys to 
creating a positive experience. 
REAL ESTATE SPECULATION 
Most people who enter the real estate market are seeking the safety and 
advantages normally associated with this investment: direct control, positive 
after-tax cash flow, significant tax advantages, and steady appreciation in 
market value. These features make real estate one of the best investments 
available and present an excellent way to diversify your portfolio. 
However, some people would prefer to speculate in real estate. For those 
with higher-than-average risk tolerance, there are several ways to become a 
speculator. One method is to buy rental properties in a market where prices 
are rising quickly. Some speculators are willing to take on negative cash flow 
in the belief that market price will outpace the monthly drain of cash. If they 
are right, they can make a lot of profit in a short period of time. However, 
if they are wrong, the market will top out and may even decline. In that case, 
they are stuck with inflated property and negative cash flow. This is a 
high-risk form of speculation. 
KeY Point With any form of speculation, the greater the potential for 
profits, the greater your risks. This is the basic investment equation: Risk 
and opportunity expand or contract together and are different attributes of 
the same tendency. Real estate speculation can lead to fantastic profits, 
but only if you are also willing to take significant risks. Most people are not 
well suited for the high-risk, high-reward aspects of speculation. The few 
who are will tell you stories of big profits but may be less likely to tell you 
about those times when they lost large sums of money. 
Speculation is a form of gambling. To make a profit, you know you must 
beat the odds, so you take a chance and hope that luck is on your side. When 

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 46 ]
combined with a degree of skill and experience, the luck factor can be 
reduced somewhat, but it cannot be eliminated entirely. Most real estate 
investors are impressed enough with the benefits of buying single-family 
housing, taking the tax advantages, and waiting out market appreciation. 
Those who are attracted to the roller-coaster ride of speculation should be 
willing to take the whole mix: fast and high profits, as well as fast and 
potentially high losses. 
Fixer-Upper Properties 
One method of speculation that is usually less risky is buying fixer-upper 
properties for fast turnaround. This investor looks for run-down houses that 
need cosmetic care—painting, yard work, and minor repairs. By fixing up 
the property and then marketing it as soon as possible, a speculator can 
make a good profit, assuming that market values hold and there is a strong 
demand for housing. 
If you go into the fixer-upper market, you need to become an expert at 
identifying what types of properties are the best candidates for a healthy 
profit and what types of repairs will produce the best return. Of course, you 
also need to be able to perform the work yourself or hire someone who can 
do the work for you. These three important qualifiers are at the heart of a 
successful fixer-upper investment and deserve to be discussed in more detail. 
Finding the Best Properties. The most likely fixer-upper property is a 
single-family home that is structurally sound but that has been neglected. To 
make the investment worthwhile, the ideal candidate should be priced far 
enough below the typical market value for homes of the same type and 
located in the same neighborhood. Finding the worst house on a good block, 
in other words, is the primary guideline for locating a good fixer-upper. To 
determine whether it is going to be worth your time and effort, there has to 
be enough spread between the home’s cost and the cost of other houses; 
otherwise, you won’t be able to make a profit. How much is enough? That 
is going to depend on (a) the types of repairs that need to be done, (b) the 
time it is going to take, and (c) how much of the work you are able to do on 
your own. 
It is quite difficult to find an appropriate fixer-upper property in areas 
that are kept up and in good shape. Because property values tend to be 
high in such areas, few if any properties are neglected. Another problem is 
that the difference between fixer-upper values and current market values 
of well-maintained homes could be too slim to justify the strategy. You are 
far more likely to find promising fixer-upper candidates in more run-down 

getting started in rental ProPertY inVesting 
[ 47 ]
neighborhoods. In these areas, property values are going to be lower than in 
nicer neighborhoods, the market for housing is likely to be weaker, and the 
potential for the dollar amount of profits could be limited as well. However, 
the rate of return will be greater because the difference in market values will 
be more significant. So you may be able to trade fixer-upper properties in 
greater volume and realize a profit in poorer neighborhoods, given the 
varying market risk factors. 
So there’s the dilemma. Better neighborhoods hold higher market value 
and represent lower-risk investments over time. Poorer neighborhoods offer 
naturally lower-priced homes but have greater potential for appreciation. 
Just as higher-priced homes make poorer candidates as rentals (because the 
mortgage payments may be far higher than market rental levels), the same 
higher-priced homes are far less likely to work as fixer-uppers. 
Identifying the Best Yielding Repairs. The most profitable repairs are those 
that are strictly cosmetic. A house with overgrown weeds in the yard seems 
overwhelming, but landscaping is among the fastest and easiest of problems 
to fix. A house needing to be painted is also a good candidate, especially 
if you are willing to do the painting yourself. Properties requiring inside 
paint jobs and minor repairs are also good. Once you move beyond the 
range of cosmetic fixes, the question of affordability becomes more 
important. If you need to replace major plumbing and electrical systems, 
the roof, or other expensive features of the house, you are going to have 
difficulty making the fixer-upper plan work. The cost of hiring a plumber 
or an electrician is so high that your return would be too marginal to make 
the move a practical one. You are going to make the most profit working 
with fixer-upper properties if you have the skills and the time to do the 
work yourself. 
Performing the Work Yourself. The more types of repairs and improvements 
you are able to perform, the more practical the fixer-upper market becomes 
as an alternative. Simple repairs (e.g., yard work, painting inside and 
outside) cost little and are easy to do. If you have carpentry and other 
skills, then you can take on more complicated repairs. If you are skilled at 
kitchen cabinetry, roofing, electrical work, or plumbing, the fixer-upper 
market available to you is far broader than for most people. But if you are 
going to need to hire experts to put the house back in working order, that 
will cut into your profit margin and may even offset your potential profits 
completely. By specializing in fixer-upper properties needing the types of 
work you can perform on your own, you will be able to earn far higher 
profits than an unskilled investor. 

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 48 ]
Other Factors to Keep in Mind 
 
What about closing costs? An important consideration for fixer-upper 
investors is that of closing costs. You have to pay some costs when you buy 
and even more when you sell. In evaluating whether the idea makes sense, 
you must factor in the time involved and the estimated closing costs to 
ensure that you have a good chance of making a profit. Merely breaking 
even isn’t acceptable, considering all the work you have to do. Why place 
yourself at risk if you don’t have the likely outcome of a decent profit? 
 
Should you live in the fixer-upper? Some people like to move into the fixer-upper 
while they are working on it. The advantage to this approach is that you can 
continue paying on the mortgage while living in the property. Then, if it 
takes longer than you expect to resell the property, it is simply your primary 
residence and the pressure is off to sell quickly. The major disadvantage to 
living in the fixer-upper is the stress it may cause for your family. Moving 
frequently and living in homes that are continually being repaired and fixed 
can cause significant tension and adversely affect your personal quality of 
life. To succeed as a fixer-upper investor, you should also consider how your 
decision will affect your family. If you and your spouse are fairly young and 
don’t have children, and you both want to work on fixer-uppers, it is the best 
possible situation. But if you have small children and your spouse does not 
want to move from house to house—and won’t participate in the project—
the whole venture will soon deteriorate into an ongoing argument over dust, 
noise, and disruption. No amount of profit can justify the stress that will 
result. 
 
How long should you keep it? The fixer-upper investor also has to decide how 
long to keep a property, especially if it will be used as a primary residence. 
If you live in your home for two years or more, any profit you earn upon 
sale is tax free up to $500,000 for a married couple. You can execute as 
many tax-free sales as you want as long as you meet the two-year 
requirement. There also is no age restriction on the two-year rule. 
Homeowners of any age can take advantage of this tax rule. For the 
fixer-upper investor, though, there is a dilemma. Without the two-year rule, 
the goal would be to resell properties as quickly as possible, take the profit, 
and reinvest elsewhere. But if the profit is substantial, it could also make 
sense to use each property as a primary residence and wait out the two-year 
period so that the profit will be completely tax free. (Rules will vary by 
state, so even if you escape federal taxes, you could still be liable for state 
capital gains tax from selling your primary residence.) 

getting started in rental ProPertY inVesting 
[ 49 ]
KeY Point The potential conflict between tax breaks and quality of 
living needs to be resolved. If you make decisions based only on tax 
questions, your investments will become counterproductive. If you 
determine that quality of life is a priority and, as a result, you do not 
invest in real estate at all, then you lose potential profits and tax benefits. 
So there needs to be a balance between the two sides. 
The attractive features of rental real estate include a wide variety of choices. 
Whichever way you decide to go—commercial property or residential, 
single-family house or multiunit buildings, part-year rentals or fixer-uppers—
you must keep thorough records of your transactions. Record keeping is vital 
not only to track cash flow and profit or loss but also to document the 
expenses you claim as part of your tax return. Subsequent chapters will 
provide you with a wealth of practical guidance to help you understand the 
various financial aspects of investing in and managing rental real estate.

CASH FLOW:  
THE ESSENCE OF  
RENTAL REAL ESTATE
F
or a landlord, the need for positive cash flow—to have more money 
coming in than going out—is in many ways more important than 
month-to-month profit. As a rule, real estate investors do not mind a paper 
loss for tax purposes. In fact, the perfect situation is one in which you 
achieve positive cash flow and report a net tax loss. Is this possible? Yes, and 
in fact, it is the most likely scenario if you plan properly. 
Ideally, positive cash flow should be generated from the properties 
themselves. This means that you do not need to invest more and more cash 
each year just to maintain your real estate investment. In some markets, 
achieving positive cash flow requires higher down payments than you would 
like; in some other markets—where property values are too high but market 
rents are too low—positive cash flow is simply not possible. In those 
situations, it doesn’t make sense to embark on a real estate investment plan. 
Only those who have owned property for many years can afford to rent out 
property because they bought the property before prices rose, because 
monthly mortgage payments are small, and because, in all likelihood, market 
rents are high enough to pay the mortgage.
The interaction between rental income and mortgage payments is the 
starting point in an analysis of cash flow. Your first goal should be to 
generate rent adequate to pay your monthly principal and interest, property 
taxes, insurance, and utilities. Even if you achieve this offset, it does not 
allow for unexpected repairs or vacancies, which are the unpleasant realities 
of real estate investing. When you calculate the tax benefit of investing in 
real estate, however, it is possible that your tax savings may be enough to 
cover maintenance and repairs. 

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 52 ]
ANALYZING CASH FLOW BEFORE INVESTING 
How important is it to analyze the cash flow situation for your rental 
properties? It is the critical first step in the process—the very analysis that 
determines whether you should even proceed. If you invest in a property that 
does not produce enough income to cover your known expenses, you may 
create a financial hardship for yourself. At that point, you have two concerns. 
First, how can you afford to continue carrying the property indefinitely with 
negative cash flow? And, second, is the property value increasing beyond the 
monthly outflow of money? If it is not, then by design, you have created a 
losing situation. 
Defining Investment Value 
Investment value has to be defined for real estate in ways much different 
from other investments. With stocks, investment value may refer to long-term 
growth prospects, meaning today’s price per share is a good value and is 
likely to grow in the future. You can buy stock, collect dividends, and wait; 
there is no requirement to put more money into the investment each month. 
In real estate, investment value has to be defined in terms of (a) supply and 
demand and (b) cash flow. Supply and demand may be applied either to 
property values and their growth rates or to the separate demand for rental 
properties. Both tend to move in similar cycles, but not necessarily. You may 
find situations in which prices are rising but rental unit demand is relatively 
low, or vice versa. 
The second way to define investment value is to evaluate cash flow. If your 
mortgage payment is significantly higher than what you can expect to collect 
in rents, you have to determine whether you can afford the extra payment 
each month. It makes sense to accept a negative cash flow situation only if 
and when you are convinced that property values are growing so quickly 
that they outpace the monthly negative cash flow. 
Comparing Rents to Housing Prices 
When you analyze the typical level of rent paid for housing in your area 
and compare that dollar amount to the typical price of housing, you can 
tell whether it makes sense to buy real estate, keeping the need for cash 
flow in mind. 

casH floW: tHe essence of rental real estate 
[ 53 ]
EXAMPLE 1: In your city, the typical small home (two bedrooms, one bath, 
1,400 square feet) can be purchased for $85,000. An 80 percent 
mortgage ($68,000) will cost you $325 per month, assuming a 
thirty-year loan at 4 percent. If rents for such homes run about $350 
per month, then the rental income will cover your mortgage payment. 
(For the sake of simplicity, this example does not include an allowance 
for insurance, property taxes, utilities, and repairs.) 
EXAMPLE 2: If the same house costs $150,000 in your city, your 80 
percent mortgage of $120,000 would cost about $573 per month. If 
average rents run at $450 for such homes, it would not be practical to 
invest under these terms. You would begin with a negative cash flow of 
$123 per month, even before calculating taxes, insurance, and other 
expenses. 
These two examples demonstrate that cash flow is a fairly straightforward 
test: If property values are so high that a mortgage payment will exceed the 
level of rents you can reasonably expect to earn, it will not be practical to 
buy rental property. 
Keeping Cash Flow in Mind 
While rental levels tend to track property values, this is not always the case. 
In some situations, rental demand can be quite high while property values 
remain relatively low; in other cases, property values may outpace what you 
could expect to bring in through rents. For example, in a suburban town in 
the Midwest, where a large portion of the population consists of college 
students, rents may be relatively high due to demand, but property values 
relatively low—the ideal situation for rental investing with cash flow in 
mind. However, in areas such as New York City, San Francisco, or Los 
Angeles, property values are quite high, and although rents are high as well, 
cash flow simply won’t work out. If the typical starter home costs $300,000 
(so that you would have to find a mortgage of $240,000 at the 80 percent 
level), mortgage payments would be $1,678 per month (based on a thirty-year 
term at 7.5 percent). If you could expect to get only $1,000 per month, then 
clearly it would not make sense to consider investing. 

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 54 ]
One way to overcome this problem is to make a larger down payment, 
thereby lowering your monthly payments. However, many would-be real 
estate investors cannot afford to make down payments of 30 percent, 40 
percent, or more. While that would go a long way toward easing the cash 
flow problem, it is simply not a viable solution for most people. 
KeY Point The very first step in determining whether to consider real 
estate investing is to go through this preliminary analysis. What is the 
cost of the property? What level of rental demand exists? And finally, do 
the numbers work out? 
CALCULATING RENTAL PROPERTY  
CASH FLOW 
The next step involves making comparisons between the current market 
value of likely rental properties and the rent you are likely to receive—based 
on your analysis of the market. You want to be able to estimate the most 
likely cash flow experience you will have in real estate. This process includes 
calculating monthly rental income, property taxes, insurance, utilities, and 
other expenses; the mortgage payment; an amount to have in reserve for 
repairs or vacancies; and the tax benefit you will gain from investing in 
rental property.
Breaking Down Monthly Payments 
To estimate cash flow, you must divide monthly payments into several 
categories. These are: 
 
Deductible Expenses That You Pay. Examples are payments for interest on 
your mortgage loan; property taxes, insurance, and utilities; applicable 
other expenses, such as accounting or legal fees, office supplies, or car and 
truck expenses; and the cost of supplies you need for small repairs. 
WHere to looK Free instructional manuals can be ordered on the 
Internal Revenue Service’s (IRS’s) Web site at https://www.irs.gov. 
Request Publication 527, “Residential Rental Property,” for more 
information about deductible expenses. 

casH floW: tHe essence of rental real estate 
[ 55 ]
 
Deductible Noncash Expenses. You can deduct depreciation on the value of 
the property but not the land; on the car or truck you use to conduct your 
real estate business; and on computer, landscaping, or other equipment 
required to do business. While you do not make actual payments for 
depreciation, you calculate the amount you are allowed to deduct and 
claim it as an expense (see Chapter 8). You also amortize points paid at 
closing if you are required to claim that expense over several years (see 
Chapter 11). 
 
Payments That Are Not Deductible. You make monthly payments on your 
mortgage, and, while the interest portion of the payment is deductible, the 
portion that goes to principal cannot be deducted. You may also pay for 
equipment that you have to depreciate over many years; such payments 
are not deductible in the year you spend the money. For example, if you 
purchase a $600 lawn mower, you can depreciate it, but you cannot 
deduct the payment the year it is made. 
Plugging in Actual Figures 
Each of these types of transactions has to be treated differently to calculate 
cash flow—not only because it involves a mix of cash and noncash but also 
because you want to calculate your tax benefits as well. For real estate 
investing, the tax benefits are part of the overall equation, so you need a 
worksheet to accurately determine the outcome. A cash flow calculation 
worksheet is shown in Table 3-1.

To fill in this worksheet, begin with a few assumptions: 

Rent of $700 per month is realistic. 
 

Property taxes average $45 per month. 

Insurance averages $13 per month. 
 

Utilities that you, as landlord, will pay average $12 per month. (This 
figure may seem low, but remember that tenants usually pay most of 
the utilities, including gas and electric, water, and cable TV. As a 
landlord, you will probably pay very little, if any, utility bills.) 
 

You estimate “other” expenses at $30 per month. 

Your property can be purchased for $120,000. Of this, $30,000 is
the estimated value of land and $90,000 is for improvements; you 
are allowed to deduct $273 per month for depreciation. 
 

You do not plan to buy any equipment during the first year, so the 
estimated additional asset cost is zero. 
 

Your mortgage payment is based on 80 percent financing ($96,000) 
and a 4 percent rate. Payments will be $458 per month (assuming a 
thirty-year amortization). 

Your tax rate (federal and state combined) is 40 percent, based on a 
33 percent federal and 7 percent state tax. (Of course, this figure 
will vary by state, as well as by your taxable income each year.) 
With all of these assumptions, you can complete the worksheet using 
monthly averages. An example follows in Table 3-2.

In this example, the after-tax cash flow is negative. This occurs because the 
net for tax purposes of $7 per month translates to a $3 per month increase 
in your overall tax liability (at the 40 percent tax rate). So, in the example, 
you report a small net profit but have positive cash flow of $142 per month. 
This improves over time as the mortgage interest declines. This cash flow 
sets up a buffer for unexpected expenses.
In cases of marginal or negative cash flow, there is no cushion for 
unexpected expenses or vacancies. That represents a worst case scenario in 
which you would not be able to affordany unexpected surprises. In assessing 
the risk, you should want to perform a preliminary cash flow analysis before 
buying property. Solutions include looking at lower-priced homes, putting 
more money down, or waiting until the market becomes more favorable on 
a cash flow basis.
Depreciation is listed as part of the tax calculation but not cash in/out 
because this is a calculated expense and not a cash outlay. Principal on the 
mortgage is a cash outlay but not deductible for tax purposes; thus, it is 
listed in the first column but not in the second.

[ 58 ]
risK factors If you believe that rental demand is quite strong and 
that you are not likely to suffer vacancies in your rental property, the 
overall assumption shown in this exercise is reasonable. However, as a 
landlord, you have to live with the risks of possible vacancies, unexpected 
repairs, and tenants who fail to pay rent every month. The higher your 
down payment (and the lower your mortgage payments), the better your 
cash flow, which also translates to lower risks. 
DETERMINING INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL 
In the previous example, average interest and principal payments were 
applied on a typical monthly basis. How do you know what your interest 
and principal will be? Some lenders break down the monthly payment for 
you, which gives you the current month’s division. Other lenders provide no 
details, except an annual summary of interest for tax-reporting purposes. 
You may need to calculate monthly interest and principal payments on your 
own to be able to estimate cash flow. The calculation is not difficult. 
Step 1. Multiply the beginning balance by the interest rate. In the example in the 
previous section, the original loan balance was $96,000, and the interest rate was 
4 percent. We further assumed a thirty-year amortization rate, so that monthly 
payments would be $458.32. (Amortization tables showing monthly payments 
can be found in interest rate books or online, by searching for “mortgage 
amortization tables.”) In our example, the first year’s calculation would be: 
$96,000.00 × 0.04 = $3,840.00 
Step 2. Divide the annual interest by twelve (months) to calculate the current 
month’s interest expense: 
$3,840.00 ÷ 12 = $320.00 
Step 3. Subtract the current month’s interest expense from the total payment 
to calculate the current month’s principal payment: 
$458.32 − $320.00 = $138.32 
Step 4. Subtract the principal payment from the loan balance to calculate 
the new loan balance: 
$96,000.00 − $138.32 = $95,861.68

These calculations can be carried forward twelve times to determine the full 
year’s total payments, interest, principal, and ending balance. This 
calculation is shown in Table 3-3.

THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN  
CASH FLOW AND PROFIT 
Any business—whether real estate owned for profit or a retail shop— 
demands planning and carefully detailed management. At first glance, it 
would seem that cash flow and profits are the same thing: Cash comes in 
and cash goes out. But in practice, the two are vastly different. In real estate, 
as the previous section demonstrated, just determining an estimated tax 
benefit requires considerable calculation. So it is commonly the case that 
cash flow and tax-based net profit are quite different. The principal paid on 
your mortgage and money paid for capital improvements decrease cash flow 
because money is paid out without being deductible. Depreciation expense, 
on the other hand, is possibly your largest annual deduction after interest, 
but it does not involve payments in cash. 

casH floW: tHe essence of rental real estate 
[ 61 ]
Comparing Different Properties 
Since cash flow and net profits (or losses) are different, why even make the 
comparison? Because as a method for measuring the cash flow and tax 
benefits, a property-to-property test reveals the benefit of holding onto a 
specific investment for the long term. 
EXAMPLE: You own two properties. Property A produces positive cash flow 
of $588 per year and also provides you with a tax loss of $3,600. The 
combination of the two is $4,188 per year. Property B provides an 
annual net loss of $1,020 (an $85 loss per month) but produces annual 
tax losses of $4,410. 
That adds up to $3,390 (after deducting the negative cash flow from the 
tax loss). Compare the two properties in Table 3-6.
TABLE 3-6. PROPERTY COMPARISONS ($)

Cash flow
Tax loss
Combined
A
588
3,600
4,188
B
(1,020)
4,410
3,390
Clearly, property A is more advantageous because it provides positive cash 
flow. In comparison, property B suffers a negative cash flow each year. You 
may justify holding onto the second investment if property values are 
increasing at a rate greater than the negative cash flow, assuming that you 
can afford to carry the excess each month. It makes no sense, though, to 
keep a property whose market value is being outpaced by negative cash flow. 
The tax benefits are not worth the loss. (Remember, monthly cash flow has 
already included a calculation of the tax benefit.) 
Best of Both Worlds 
If you are able to limit your investments to only those properties that 
produce both positive cash flow and tax-based losses, you get the best of 
both worlds. The level of comparison between profit (or loss) and cash 
flow and tax loss is a goal worth striving for, and one that can be achieved 
in the right markets. 

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 62 ]
iMPortant There are limitations to annual losses you can claim 
under the law. The maximum net loss you are allowed to claim each year 
is $25,000, and that goes down if your taxable income exceeds 
$100,000 (see Chapter 9). 
The point worth making in regard to cash flow is that monthly net losses 
can add up to a substantial reduction of your tax liability. The calculations 
also demonstrate that the difference between cash flow and profits can be 
large, so you need to keep these differences in mind when planning ahead. 
SHOULD YOU INVEST IN MORE THAN ONE  
RENTAL PROPERTY? 
This question ultimately comes up. Does it make sense to invest in four or 
five properties—or even more? If you can finance an infinite number of 
properties, and mortgage payments are covered by rents, why not? Many 
promotions offering to show you how to get rich in real estate depend on the 
highly leveraged approach, but in practice it does not always work out. In 
planning cash flow, be aware of the potential effects of: 
 
Vacancies. If your area has a very low vacancy rate, you probably do not 
need to be concerned with chronic vacancy problems. (If you do experience 
high vacancies, the cause may be the condition of the property.) In markets 
with higher vacancy rates or seasonal changes in demand for rental 
housing, you need to plan ahead carefully. In projecting your cash flow 
through the year, you must determine whether it is feasible to work with 
more than one property, given the possibility of the vacancy factor. You 
may be able to get through a month or two with one property vacant, but 
what about five? Can you afford to continue making mortgage payments 
with no rental income? 
 
Tenant Problems. Even when your properties are occupied throughout the 
year, another risk is that your tenants will fall behind in the rent. In the 
worst situation, a tenant simply does not pay rent at all, and you have to 
begin eviction proceedings. That can be expensive and stressful and takes 
time as well. Depending on the rules in your state, you would have to 
expect to lose between one and three months’ rent to complete an eviction. 
If you select tenants with great care, you can minimize this problem, but 
it is a very real possibility, and the more properties you own, the higher 
your exposure. 

casH floW: tHe essence of rental real estate 
[ 63 ]
 
Unexpected Repairs. There is never a good time to discover that you need 
to spend money to repair a heating system, a roof, or burst water pipes. 
Even with the best maintained property, unexpected repairs are going to 
arise and cost you money. With a single rental, you may have the financial 
reserves to get through the experience. With multiple properties, the 
potential strain on your personal budget could escalate. 
 
Tax Loss Limitations. As discussed previously, you are allowed to deduct up 
to $25,000 in losses on real estate investments each year, and other 
limitations may apply as well, depending on your overall income. So from 
the tax point of view, there is no advantage to owning so many properties 
that your losses exceed the $25,000 annual level. Because tax benefits 
often make the difference between positive and negative cash flow, your 
advance planning should also take into account the tax aspects of owning 
several properties. 
 
Lending Restrictions. The secondary market for real estate financing imposes 
rules and limits on how many rentals you can finance through conventional 
lenders, based on your income, credit, and down payment requirements. 
Other restrictions include the level of debt you are allowed to finance. 
While homeowners are allowed to mortgage up to 90 percent of a home’s 
value, real estate investors may be limited to 80 percent or even 70 percent, 
depending on the program. So if you purchase a $100,000 rental property, 
you are likely to need to make a $20,000 or $30,000 down payment. Of 
course, the more properties you own, the more cash you need to make 
these payments. 
 
Time and Effort. Finally, as a practical matter, you need to determine how 
much time you want to spend managing real estate. When you own stocks 
or mutual fund shares, you do not have to spend much time at all to 
manage your holdings. With real estate, you must put in time for a variety 
of demands, and the more properties you own, the more time you will 
need to devote. 
KeY Point With these inhibiting factors in mind, you need to be 
aware of not only the financial and practical limitations but also the level 
of risk involved with purchasing rental properties. If you wish to own 
multiple houses, the cash flow risk increases proportionately. While a 
single rental contains an element of cash flow risk, it increases with each 
additional property that you buy. This doesn’t mean you should avoid 
investing in more than one property, just that you should carefully 
evaluate each situation and plan ahead for potential problems.

CONTINGENCY PLANNING FOR CASH FLOW 
While these example showed that it is possible to experience positive cash 
flow and a net tax loss at the same time, real-life situations do not always 
work out that way. Other factors concerning cash flow require contingency 
planning on your part. Due to the nature of unexpected expenses and costs, 
vacancies, or tenant problems, it is impossible to build in absolute certainty 
in your real estate investment program. You can mitigate your risks by doing 
careful and thorough tenant screening, picking the best locations for your 
rental properties, diligently monitoring your property, investing only when 
the economic conditions indicate a strong demand, and limiting your 
exposure by not overbuying in the market. 
Even in the best markets and after the most diligent research on your part, 
there are going to be unknown and unexpected surprises. How do you plan 
for these? Here are some general guidelines: 
 
Make sure you have an adequate cash reserve. You need to limit your risk 
exposure by matching up property investments with cash reserves. If your 
family income is adequate to cover what you consider a realistic level of 
risk on two properties, then buying three or four properties may be taking 
excessive risk. You may justify exceeding that level by reasoning that it is 
unlikely you will face vacancies or unexpected repairs on all of your 
properties at the same time. That is a reasonable evaluation, as long as you 
enter the situation with an awareness of the cash flow risks. Your cash 
flow reserves are literally the amount of money you can afford out of your 
personal budget to cover unexpected losses, whether they are repairs, 
vacancies, or other problems. 
 
Take your time in acquiring properties. Do thorough research, and don’t allow 
anyone to pressure you into making a fast decision. Good bargains are 
plentiful in most markets, and if you lose out on one today, another one 
will show up tomorrow. Take the time you need to research the prices of 
properties, vacancy rates, and rental demand trends; to find the best 
neighborhoods; and to analyze likely after-tax cash flow—all before you 
commit yourself. 
 
Require inspection of a property as a condition for closing. The worst outcome 
for any real estate investor is to discover that they have unwittingly bought 
a “money pit”—a property that demands never-ending maintenance. 
Never trade your right to require inspections in exchange for other 
concessions. As a contingency, require that the seller agree to an 
independent inspection, and reserve the right to cancel the whole deal if 
that inspection uncovers hidden flaws in the property. You may wish to 

casH floW: tHe essence of rental real estate 
[ 65 ]
pay the $200 to $300 fee for the inspection, just to make sure that you get 
a qualified and independent report. If you ask the seller to pay for the 
inspection, you lose the right to ensure the independence of the inspector. 
 
Avoid buying properties that don’t qualify for conventional financing. Some 
first-time investors have gotten around the need to qualify for financing 
by working mainly with sellers who agree to carry a loan for them. As 
attractive as this might seem, you should ask why they are willing to 
finance your purchase. Chances are that the house’s condition prevents it 
from qualifying for conventional financing. If that’s the case, you need to 
know what those conditions are before you buy. If you simply proceed 
without finding out why the seller is willing to carry a loan, you could be 
buying someone else’s problems. The day will come when you wish to sell; 
if the house has a serious deficiency, you won’t be able to move it to a new 
buyer, who will probably also need financing. Proceed cautiously when a 
seller offers to carry a loan for you; it could be a red flag. 
 
Perform preventive maintenance regularly. Plan to perform specific tasks as 
part of your annual cycle. If you own property in northern climates, wrap 
water pipes and replace heater filters at the beginning of winter; clean out 
gutters in the fall; maintain septic systems and wells in the spring; and 
have other expensive systems checked by an expert once a year. The 
money you spend making sure everything is in working order may prevent 
more expensive surprises later. 
 
If maintenance is a chronic problem, sell the property. Don’t make the mistake 
of keeping property that is costing more than it’s worth. Problem houses 
don’t get better; they tend to continue causing you problems. If you are 
continually facing unexpected expenses and losing money, cut your losses 
as soon as possible. Put the property on the market and escape the 
continuing burden. 
 
Cut losses when necessary. If you overbuy and realize that you are losing 
money or simply cannot afford to cover the cash flow problems you face, 
even if temporary, then the smart move is to sell some of your properties. 
If you own two or three properties and you come to the conclusion that 
you can only manage one, get rid of the excess. Keep the property that 
produces the best cash flow and presents the fewest problems. Don’t make 
the mistake of selling your best performing assets and keeping the 
problems. A cash flow difficulty is caused by the very properties you need 
to sell. Cutting losses is the smart move when you are overextended. 
 
Monitor the market, and be prepared to alter your strategy. Nothing remains the 
same forever. Just as stockholders need to watch for changing fundamentals 
of companies whose stock they buy, real estate investors have to do the 
same. Today’s strong demand market can soften next year. Your city may 
currently have a very low vacancy rate, but any number of factors could 

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 66 ]
change the situation—for example, construction of a large apartment 
complex, closure of a major employer’s facility, seasonal factors, or a poor 
local economy. In areas near the Canadian border, changes in international 
exchange rates may affect the local retail market and, as a result, housing 
demand. You must continually monitor your local economy, demand for 
rental housing, and other factors that will affect that demand over time. 
GETTING BETTER CASH FLOW 
You can take some steps to improve cash flow. For example, if you were 
planning to pay for water and garbage disposal while your tenants will be 
responsible for electric and gas, you can instead shift all of the utility costs 
to your tenants in addition to rent. By shopping for more desirable mortgage 
terms or making a larger down payment, you can reduce the cash flow gap 
further. If lower rates become available, you can refinance, lowering your 
interest expense and monthly payment. 
Even when the local conditions are not ideal for investing in real estate, 
you can improve your cash flow by picking properties carefully, altering 
your initial ideas about what types of rentals to buy, and increasing your 
down payment. 
Multiple-Unit Properties 
Your evaluation of likely cash flow may be interesting when you compare 
single-family housing to likely outcomes with multiunit housing. If you can 
purchase a single-family house for $120,000 and rent it out for $700 a month, 
you can make positive cash flow but only marginally. As an alternative, 
consider looking at multiple-unit investments. If you can find a duplex for the 
same $120,000 investment, you might also discover that each unit can be 
rented out for $500, increasing your cash flow by $300 per month—without 
a corresponding increase in expenses or in cash paid out. This is an example 
only, of course; the specific rent levels and prices of property vary by region. 
However, the point is that a duplex, triplex, or even a small apartment 
building may produce far better cash flow than a single-family home without 
requiring more investment or a higher mortgage payment. 
A small apartment building is likely to require a greater investment and, 
perhaps, a higher down payment as well. However, if the cash flow justifies 
that as an alternative, it could make sense. Buying a five-unit apartment 
building would probably produce better cash flow than buying five 
single-family houses. It would also be easier and more economical to 
maintain, insure, and monitor a single property. 

casH floW: tHe essence of rental real estate 
[ 67 ]
Larger Down Payment 
In determining whether to make a higher down payment as a means for 
improving cash flow, the obvious limiting factor is availability of cash. 
However, a second level of analysis should be the use of available capital. If 
you can make cash flow work for a smaller down payment, that leaves more 
investment capital available for other purposes. The higher your down 
payment, the lower your cash flow risk, but more of your capital is tied up.
Improved Tax Benefits 
As your overall taxable income rises and you move into higher tax brackets, 
the tax advantages of owning real estate will be correspondingly higher as 
well. A relatively low overall (federal and state) tax bracket of 20–25 percent 
is not as advantageous, in terms of tax reduction, as an overall tax bracket of 
40–50 percent or more. This, too, will create better cash flow down  the road. 
MANAGING CASH FLOW RISK 
Because you need to make mortgage payments—even if you do not have a 
paying tenant in the property—there is a greater demand on your personal 
budget. This means that even if you have positive cash flow, a couple of 
months of vacancies could be a problem. For many first-time investors, the 
cash flow risk of real estate is invisible. You don’t think about it until you 
begin managing the property and repairs become necessary, vacancies occur, 
or your tenant is late with the rent one month. In these situations, the risk 
becomes all too apparent. 
Spreading the Risk 
One way to manage the cash flow risk is by spreading it. To many investors, 
this means buying more properties so that a negative situation in one is 
offset by positive cash flow in another. This may work most of the time but 
not all of the time. For example, if an increased vacancy rate is caused by 
changed local conditions, it is also likely that you will have higher vacancies 
on all of your properties. In that case, the intended diversification doesn’t 
achieve its intended result. 
Another way to spread the risk is by investing in multiple-unit properties 
instead of single-family homes, as discussed previously. While the single- 
family property is likely to experience the best long-term market appreciation, 
you need to also consider how your financial life is going to be affected 

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 68 ]
during the years that you own the property. Cash flow, in this respect, is 
more important than either long-term profits or year-to-year tax benefits. 
Remember these points: 
1. You must be able to make monthly mortgage payments and pay 
for upkeep. 
2. You need to ensure that you don’t overextend your budget by 
buying too many rental properties. 
3. You need to consider your quality of life if you are managing a 
larger number of rentals. How much time are you willing to 
spend, and how much of your capital are you willing to tie up in 
illiquid, long-term investments? 
These are the important questions that define cash flow risk and that, 
ultimately, determine how many properties you should purchase as 
investments and whether you want to directly manage those properties. If 
you believe that it makes sense to own several houses or one multiple-family 
property, you can also hire a professional management company. This 
insulates you from the day-to-day tenant contact that so many people find 
problematical. 
WatcH tHis Using a property management company costs money, 
usually 10 percent of rents collected. For the marginal cash flow situation, 
such fees can be a big problem. 
DO THE NUMBERS ADD UP? 
Real estate cannot be economically bought and sold like stocks or mutual 
fund shares, so the market is far less liquid. For this reason, you need to 
determine the longer-term trends that affect both real estate values and 
likely long-term supply and demand for rentals. This can be achieved by 
studying employment statistics and knowing the number of rental units 
being built, the vacancy rates, and the prices of properties. Collectively, 
these factors also define whether or not you can make the cash flow 
work in your favor. If prices are too high, then mortgage payments will be 
higher, too. 
It all comes down to a question of whether the numbers work out. As a 
real estate investor, you accept certain market risks, as you do in any form 

casH floW: tHe essence of rental real estate 
[ 69 ]
of investing. As long as you know those risks and can live with them, and 
the numbers work out to your satisfaction, you will better understand the 
finite nature of your own financial situation. Success in real estate investing 
is the result of initial research, a thorough awareness of risk, and the 
willingness to invest within your limits.

PICKING THE BEST  
INVESTMENT FOR YOU
W
hat constitutes “good” rental property? Can you simply pick a house, 
duplex, or apartment building and depend on supply and demand? Or 
do you need to consider more factors, both financial and market driven? 
While it might seem that the study of supply and demand would be 
enough to decide whether the market can support another rental, you need 
to go beyond the initial study and discover more facts. You must also 
understand how the attributes of a particular property are going to affect 
rental value, as well as what type of tenant the property is likely to draw. A 
particular property, for example, may attract a specific type of tenant 
depending on its neighborhood location, the age and condition of the home, 
the square footage, and the amount of rent you charge. 
SUPPLY AND DEMAND CYCLES IN REAL ESTATE 
The real estate market—like all investment markets—experiences cycles in 
which the relative strength of demand varies as supply grows or shrinks. A 
basic economic reality is that the cycle is predictable, but its timing cannot 
be known specifically or in advance. This is the most interesting aspect of 
real estate economics, but it also creates the greatest uncertainty. 
Direct Causes 
There is no mystery to understanding the direct causes of changes in real 
estate values. If more people need and want housing than there are properties 

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 72 ]
available, prices rise. The demand causes more building and development 
activity. As that activity continues, it finally causes overbuilding, which 
softens prices. The excess demand exceeds supply. This is the nature of the 
supply and demand market. 
The specific forces and the timing of their interaction varies considerably. 
A cycle may take a year or two, if and when big changes occur within the 
area. For example, the liberalization of rules for new home construction 
could lead to higher building activity within a very short period of time. The 
direct causes of change in supply and demand for real estate—population 
changes, interest rate fluctuations, the availability of money supply for loans 
to buyers, changes in the tax rules concerning deductions for real estate 
ownership or investment, and availability of land—can be studied to predict 
the likely timing of real estate cycles. Even so, the overall uncertainty makes 
calling the peaks and valleys elusive even for the most experienced analyst. 
Indirect Influences 
Many forces are at work during the real estate cycle, many of which are not 
connected directly to real estate values or the market for rentals. Consider 
the seasonal effect of having a large college or university population in a city. 
In some areas, college students leave during the summer, but for the rest of 
the year, they may represent 25 percent or more of the total population. 
Other influences on real estate values and rental demand include crime 
statistics, traffic, and employment trends. If a large employer decides to 
relocate elsewhere, unemployment is going to rise; in some cases, people will 
leave the area to look for work elsewhere. The loss of a major employment 
base has a devastating effect on real estate values, as well as on demand for 
rental units. By the same argument, a new employer coming into an area 
creates strong demand for real estate, including rentals. 
EXAMPLE 1: Seattle depends, to a degree, on large employers such as 
Boeing. In the 1970s, large-scale layoffs created a depression in real 
estate values. Although Seattle has since recovered and has become 
one of the fastest growing real estate markets, its vulnerability 
continues. The employment base has expanded, but Boeing remains 
one of the larger employers in the region. At the time of the layoffs, a 
commonly heard form of pessimism in the region was, “Will the last 
person to leave Seattle please turn off the lights.”

EXAMPLE 2: In the late 1980s, many employers in San Francisco moved 
out of the city in reaction to a newly passed payroll tax. The surrounding 
suburbs to the east and the north were better environments for 
corporations, so a large employee migration occurred. With the shift of 
the employment base from San Francisco to other areas in the East Bay 
and North Bay, property values in the suburbs rose dramatically 
between 1987 and 1989. The changes in value resulted from the 
sudden increase in demand for both commercial and residential 
property. Ironically, due to the shift in employment out of San Francisco, 
the net result was a decline in overall sales taxes, revenue from parking 
and transportation, and retail business. The net was a negative due to 
the punitive payroll tax.
Although the original payroll tax was replaced in 2012 with a gross 
receipts tax, the idea resurfaced in 2016. A 2016 article demonstrates that 
the government might not have learned history’s lessons, as this development 
could lead to a new migration out of the city with resulting effects on real 
estate:
San Francisco supervisors want to put a 1.5 percent payroll tax on 
November’s ballot that would hit San Francisco-based tech companies 
to help address the city’s housing shortage and chronic homelessness.
The tax would generate $120 million in revenue—calculated based 
on tech companies’ existing payroll expenses—that would be redirected 
to homelessness programs and anti-displacement initiatives, according 
to an estimate by the city’s comptroller.1
THE LOCAL MARKET VS. NATIONAL AVERAGES 
A lot of time and effort are put into studying national trends in real estate. 
Industry groups publish detailed statistics and the government tracks trends 
in prices of homes, inflation, and the average age of people buying their first 
homes. All of these statistics are interesting and useful, but they do not tell 
the story of what is going on in your town.
Look around You 
The real estate market in your region may be vastly different from the market 
in the next state or even in the next county. Considering the different 
EXAMPLE

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 74 ]
economic and demographic factors that affect real estate values, a few miles 
can make a big difference. For example, if your area is suburban and within 
an easy commute to a large city, that proximity, when factored in, may 
translate into a healthy demand for housing. However, if your area is rural, 
and there are few employers within fifty to a hundred miles, property values 
are less likely to grow as strongly. Those relatively few miles can make a big 
difference in the strength of your market, for better or for worse. 
Commuting distance to employment centers is only one of many factors 
that affect regional real estate values. Traffic rates, crime levels, the weather, 
and local amenities also influence not only today’s values, but how those 
values will change in coming months and years. If your property is located 
in or near a popular seaside resort, for example, that will favorably contribute 
to property values. But if the property is located in a hurricane zone, it could 
have the opposite effect. Therefore, a variety of different and potentially 
conflicting considerations have to be reviewed locally. 
WHere to get current inforMation To find up-to-date 
statistics on employment in your area and other important economic and 
demographic information, check the Bureau of Labor Statistics online at 
http://stats.bls.gov. This site contains many useful summaries by region 
and by state. The Web site of the U.S. Census Bureau (www.census.gov) 
provides highly detailed analysis of housing values, nationally, by region, 
and even broken down by other demographics, including family 
composition and size, income, and age of home buyers.
Think Local 
National statistics may indicate that property values are rising at a desirable 
rate, consistently from year to year and above the inflation rate. Real estate 
values may even be beating stock market average returns. Even so, it does not 
mean that real estate in your area is going to perform in line with national 
averages. To really discover what is happening locally, you need to go to a 
local real estate broker, your banker, or Multiple Listing Service (MLS). 
You also need to isolate employment statistics and housing trends for the 
specific area where you are thinking of buying property. This is a fairly 
complex matter if you live in a built-up region but far easier if your city is 
isolated. If you live in the Northeast, for example, your city or town may be 
part of a larger metropolitan area of a major city. However, in the Midwest 
and West, cities tend to be more separated, so local and regional statistics 
are more easily viewed in isolation.

A Tale of Three Regions: The corridor between New York City and 
Philadelphia is built up, and the entire area could be viewed as one 
massive bedroom community. Anyone living in the New Jersey corridor 
could reasonably work in Philadelphia, New York, or dozens of smaller 
cities within a hundred-mile radius. In that situation, how do you focus 
on housing and rental demand trends in your region? The region itself is 
so large that it consists of many different subregions. The solution is to 
study the last year or two in terms of housing prices, demand for rentals, 
and other related statistics (including population, services, traffic, crime, 
and amenities) and to isolate the area where you would consider investing 
in real estate. 
If you live in Austin, Texas, you have an entirely different situation. 
The region is heavily populated and surrounded by many smaller cities. 
But compared to the New York and Philadelphia area, Austin is relatively 
isolated, so a regional market is more clearly defined. The fast growing 
suburban communities of Round Rock and Georgetown on the I-35 
corridor to the north are good examples of how communities may grow 
up close to a larger metropolitan area, though the region is limited in 
terms of a likely real estate market. 
A third possibility is that you live in an area such as Casper, 
Wyoming. This is a relatively small city with considerable distance to 
the next built-up area. The likely growth in prices and demand for real 
estate in this region is far different from that in the New-York-to- 
Philadelphia corridor or even the Austin region. 
Look at Regional Factors 
The point is that specific regional attributes—both economic and 
geographic—will affect the long-term growth prospects for real estate. A 
community located on an interstate and within thirty miles of a major city 
is going to experience far greater demand and growth than a community 
that’s farther removed from the economic activities that would bring further 
population growth to the region. 
Even when a community is relatively isolated, real estate values may be high 
and rising because of a single large employer, a nearby recreational feature, or 
other causes. As a matter of assessing market risk, you need to decide how 
much of the local real estate value exists due to those special circumstances 
and what the risk is that the conditions could change. For example, Bentonville, 
Arkansas, has a total population of 35,000. Tyson Foods employs 23,000, and 
Wal-Mart employs 9,500 from the city and surroundings.2

INVESTIGATING THE LOCAL  
REAL ESTATE MARKET 
The real estate market has two components: the prices of property and the 
demand for rentals. Property values, like all investments, go through 
predictable supply and demand cycles. Unlike stocks, the cycles for real 
estate tend to be longer. The phases of the cycles are not affected by 
day-to-day trading activity as stocks are, so in that respect, the real estate 
market is more easily understood. The market’s symptoms are easily 
recognized by studying the current market attributes. 
Property Values 
Statistics kept by real estate brokerages or a local MLS can reveal the current 
condition of the market. If you approach an experienced real estate agent 
and ask the right questions, you can easily judge and compare the local 
market to others. You need to find out the average price of homes, the 
differences between average asking prices and average selling prices (i.e., the 
swing), the amount of time property stays on the market before it sells, and 
the housing stock (i.e., inventory) currently available. The key questions you 
need to ask to judge the market are summarized in Table 4-1. 
TABLE 4-1: QUESTIONS FOR JUDGING CONDITIONS OF THE REAL ESTATE MARKET
Question
What it reveals
What is the average 
price of housing, both 
today and one year 
ago? 
Rising property values are a positive sign for investment. 
Ideally, you want to get into the market at the end of a slow 
period and just before prices begin to rise. That is difficult 
to time correctly, so, as an alternative, it makes sense to 
buy into a rising market. 
On average, what was 
the difference between 
asking prices and 
selling prices during 
the past year? 
The so-called swing is a measurement of how soft the 
market is right now. If the swing is 5 percent or less, that 
indicates strong demand. If the swing is higher, it means 
that demand is on the decline. By comparing the swing 
during the past month or two to the same period last year, 
you get a sense of the direction in which the trend is 
moving.

PicKing tHe best inVestMent for You 
[ 77 ]
Question
What it reveals
How long are houses 
staying on the market, 
on average? 
Are sales taking place within thirty to sixty days? If so, that 
means demand is very high. But if the time needed to sell 
is greater, then the signs are not as good. The longer it 
takes for property to sell, the weaker the demand.
What is the current 
inventory of homes for 
sale? 
In a high-demand market, houses go up for sale and close 
very quickly. In a softer market, it takes more time. If your 
area has an inventory equal to three months’ demand or 
less, that is a positive sign. If current homes for sale are a 
full year’s supply, that is a negative indicator.
What level of building 
activity is under way 
locally?
Are a lot of homes and housing developments being 
constructed or planned? Or is current development at a 
standstill? If activity is high, it means that demand is there, 
too. But if no one is building homes in your town, that 
means the market is poor.
Local real estate brokers and agents can also tell you the direction in which 
the market is moving. As an astute investor, you will want to time your 
decision to begin investing in real estate so that demand will be high. That 
drives up prices and makes the investment value of your property positive—
at least from the aspect of market value and potential growth. 
Demand for Rentals 
The second area you need to evaluate is demand for rental housing. This 
information is also easily discovered by checking with local property 
management companies. Housing values that are on the rise is a positive sign 
for investment. Ideally, you want to get into the market at the end of a slow 
period and just before prices begin to rise. That is difficult to time correctly, 
so, as an alternative, it makes sense to buy into a rising market. 
The identification of a specific neighborhood is important because rents 
may be significantly different in various parts of town. A residential area 
characterized by single-family, mostly owner-occupied homes will tend to 
carry a higher level of rent, whereas older homes in declining areas will 
naturally rent for far less per month. The more you understand the character 
of each neighborhood and the local economic forces at work, the better you 
will be able to decide where you want to buy rental property. 
Table 4-2 lists the important questions you should ask to compare 
neighborhoods and judge overall demand for rentals in your city or town. 

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 78 ]
TABLE 4-2. QUESTIONS FOR JUDGING CONDITIONS OF THE RENTAL MARKET
Question
What it reveals
What are the latest vacancy rates 
(overall and by neighborhood)? 
Vacancy is the most reliable indicator of 
market demand and thus of investment risk or 
opportunity. In high-demand markets, expect 
to see very low vacancies, under 5 percent. 
Compare annual changes in vacancy, and be 
aware of seasonal changes.
What is the average rent for each 
type of rental unit? 
This analysis includes size of the property, 
number of bedrooms, and location. It will vary 
by whether you’re looking at single-unit 
houses, duplexes or triplexes, or apartment 
complexes. The trend is also revealing. Find 
out how today’s average rent compares to 
rents for the same type of rental six months 
and twelve months ago.
What level of construction of new 
rentals is under way or planned?
If a lot of new rental units are being built in your 
area, it could change demand—especially if 
the building trend outpaces demand. If 
demand is consistently higher than supply and 
no construction is taking place, then the 
market is strong—a good sign for you as an 
investor.
DETERMINING WHETHER  
THE INVESTMENT MAKES SENSE 
In theory, demand is a simple concept. The greater the demand, the higher 
prices go, and if demand weakens, prices will level out and eventually fall. 
This economic theory, in practice, can be elusive and hard to identify. 
As a real estate investor, you have to contend with two primary forms of 
demand: for properties and for rental units. While they are similar and tend 
to move together, they are not necessarily the same. You may find that in 
your region, demand is strong for property but weak for rentals. If your 
town has more owner-occupied properties than rentals, for example, it is 
possible to experience strong growth in market value but fairly low rents and 
rental demand. 

PicKing tHe best inVestMent for You 
[ 79 ]
The Money Supply 
A third form of demand involves the money supply. Depending on prevailing 
interest rates and the supply of money available to lenders, it may be difficult 
at times to find attractive mortgage rates, or it may be easier at other times, 
when economic conditions change. These varying conditions will also affect 
the level of closing costs you will have to pay to obtain a mortgage loan. In 
a healthy market, it is fairly easy for borrowers with good credit to find 
lenders for rental properties, even if they already own real estate. In tighter 
markets, the rules that a lender applies (or that are imposed by the secondary 
market) may be more difficult to meet. 
Money, like all commodities, becomes available in cycles. The Federal 
Reserve controls the money supply by determining how much it will lend to 
banks and other commercial lenders. It raises or lowers interest rates to 
control economic growth. These economic factors, while beyond the scope 
of this book, have a direct impact on all financing of real estate investment. 
Few people can afford to purchase housing outright, so real estate investing 
is largely done through borrowed money. This leverage—as it is called 
among investors—can work both for and against you as an individual. 
Interest Rates 
As the money supply changes, so does the going rate for mortgages. Chances 
are that as a real estate investor, you will end up financing some of your 
properties with variable rate mortgages. The interest rate (thus, the monthly 
payment) on these obligations is adjusted periodically as interest rates rise or 
fall. The higher the going rate overall, the more your variable rate mortgage 
payments will climb. 
Variable rate mortgages are limited in two ways. They contain both an 
annual and a lifetime “cap,” or maximum. For example, you may agree to a 
variable rate mortgage and a current rate of 6 percent. The annual cap is set 
at 2 percent, and the lifetime cap on the rate is 14 percent. This means that the 
lender can never increase your rate more than 2 percent per year, and the 
loan’s interest rate can never rise above 14 percent, no matter what market 
rates are doing at the time. The prevailing interest rate exists within a range. 
The better your credit, the shorter the mortgage repayment term, and the 
higher your down payment, the lower your rate will be. And by the same 
argument, the worse your credit, the longer your repayment term, and the 
lower your down payment, the higher your interest rate will be. The range of 
rates reflects current market interest rate levels, which are adjusted periodically 
by the Federal Reserve. So, in terms of the market for real estate, you need to 
be aware of the money supply and its influence on the availability of credit. 

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 80 ]
The changes in this market can be seen in varying promotions by 
lenders. When money is plentiful, lenders compete for your business, 
offering no closing costs, low points, and fast approval. When money is not 
available in large quantities, lenders do not seek out mortgage loans and 
will not encourage you to submit an application. But the money supply is 
fluid and ever changing. A low point on the economic cycle will soon edge 
upward, and next year’s conditions will look different. Changes may be 
gradual and take many years, or they can also happen rapidly, within a matter 
of months. 
KeY Point The supply of money or the demand for money is not a 
consistent factor in the market. One of the greatest uncertainties in real 
estate—given the need for financing—is the changing economics of the 
money supply. 
The Feasibility Question 
How do you decide whether to proceed when the three types of demand—
for properties, rentals, and money—are inconsistent? It comes back to the 
question of feasibility. What is the monthly payment on a property? This 
figure has to be based on the price you expect to pay, the amount of down 
payment you can afford, and the interest rate you will be charged. If you 
compare this payment to the probable level of rent you expect to receive, you 
can quickly address the question of feasibility. If you can’t get the numbers 
to work out, it means that timing is poor. You need to look for investments 
in a different area, wait for interest rates to fall, or wait for rents to rise due to 
increased rental unit demand. 
Market Conditions That May Change 
Although any one of these factors could make the difference between 
achieving positive cash flow and falling short, it is likely that two or more 
factors will change over time. Interest rates may fall, and, at the same time, 
average rent levels may rise. So your monthly payment would be lower, and 
you would receive higher income each month. Interest rates are not a small 
part of this question. The difference of 1 percent on a thirty-year $100,000 
loan is about $68.00 per month. For example, monthly payments on a 
$100,000 loan at 6.5 percent are $632.07. At 7.5 percent, that payment rises 
to $699.22, an increase of $67.15 per month. If the interest rate then goes 
up to 8.5 percent, payment grows to $768.92, or an increase of $69.70. 

PicKing tHe best inVestMent for You 
[ 81 ]
Based on the average of about $68 per month, the difference comes out to 
more than $24,000 in total payments. If you wait out the market and average 
rates fall by 1 percent, you would save $68 per month through lower 
payments. If average rents also rose by $100 per month between now and 
the time rates change, the total positive difference on cash flow would be 
$168 per month. That could make the difference for you. 
Dealing with Future Risk 
Just as today’s conditions can improve, a healthy situation can deteriorate. 
How can you deal with these risks? First, if you are able to finance a real 
estate investment with a fixed-rate mortgage loan, that freezes your payment 
level over thirty years—and this is a considerable advantage when you also 
estimate the possible rise in market rents over the same period. The higher 
average rents move, the better your cash flow. Second, even if you go with a 
variable-rate mortgage, the increase in interest is fixed in two ways. A lender 
can raise the variable rate only by a limited amount each year (and remember, 
if rates go down, so will your variable rate). In addition, by contract, the 
variable rate can go up only so far. The annual cap, along with the lifetime 
cap, protects you from indefinite increases in the interest rate on a variable-rate 
loan. 
You can also mitigate risks by ensuring that the elements that contribute 
to rental demand are not limited. If there is only one major employer in your 
town, you are at risk. If you buy a rental property, and the employer lays off 
the whole workforce, many people will leave, you will have higher vacancies, 
and your property value will fall. You should seek out markets with a more 
varied employment base—with not only several employers but diversified 
industries as well. Then, even if one employer closes its doors and leaves, it 
will not have an across-the-board effect on the whole rental and real estate 
market. 
Look for factors other than local employment that also contribute to 
property values. A year-round tourist attraction, for example, tends to keep 
property values high. Proximity to a large city (meaning easy access and a 
short commute) may be a strong factor that adds to demand in the market, 
today and in the future as well. Suburban communities that are within fifty 
miles of major cities are often among the best investment markets. Their 
housing prices have not grown as rapidly as those within the cities themselves 
in many cases, but values rise strongly each year. This is the best possible 
situation in terms of both property value and rental demand.

KeY Point In your analysis of where to invest, consider the potential 
permanent features that are likely to contribute to growing property 
values and rental demand. For example, a large college creates demand 
in town. 
TIMING YOUR DECISION TO  
THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND CYCLE 
Just as the economic concept of demand is easily understood but more difficult 
to apply, so is the timing of your decision. The supply and demand cycle is 
fairly simple to grasp but more difficult to recognize from month to month. 
In all investments, there is a tendency for false indicators to throw off 
your estimates. In the stock market, the primary price movement (of a 
stock or an index) may reverse and appear to head in the opposite direction, 
only to stop and retreat back the other way. These false starts can occur 
time and again. A major change in direction is more easily recognized in 
hindsight, which tends to be perfect. When you are at a specific point in a 
supply and demand cycle, it is quite difficult to identify the direction or the 
timing. 
Think Long Term 
Even if you are confident about the position of the cycle, it is far more 
difficult to know how long it is going to take for the cycle to move in a 
specific direction. Every cycle sets its own pace and may speed up or slow 
down without warning. Many factors are at play, including the variable of 
behavior among sellers and buyers at any given time. You cannot approach 
real estate in the same way that stock market speculators and day traders do, 
trying to time decisions to maximize profits and moving in and out of 
positions frequently. Real estate is far less liquid than stocks, and it also does 
not trade through auction as stocks do. As a result, real estate has to be 
treated as a long-term investment. This doesn’t mean it cannot be traded 
from year to year. However, you cannot depend on fast changes in the 
market. It happens, but it would not be prudent to invest in real estate while 
depending on fast changes.

EXAMPLE: An investor bid on a house in a market where prices had grown 
quickly. The intention was to rent the house out, even though market 
rents were not adequate to cover the monthly mortgage payment. In 
fact, rents fell about $400 short of the mortgage payment. The investor 
reasoned that prices had been climbing rapidly and were going to 
continue outpacing the negative cash flow each month. The only 
problem with this approach was that the market did not continue 
expanding. In fact, prices leveled off and then fell. Although this 
change in direction was temporary, the slowdown lasted nearly two 
years. The investor could not afford to keep paying the difference 
between rental income and mortgage payments each month and had 
to sell the house at a loss. 
Don’t Speculate on Rental Real Estate 
In the previous example, the investor made the mistake of speculating in 
rental real estate. This investor was willing to absorb negative cash flow for 
a few months on the theory that price growth would outpace it and make it 
possible to sell at a profit a few months later. Speculating in this way makes 
no sense because you cannot control timing, temporary changes in a supply 
and demand cycle’s direction, or the prices of property. If you transact too 
often, profits will be absorbed or even exceeded by closing costs. Real estate 
is not a viable market for speculation, unless you have an exceptional 
understanding of the market, a healthy reserve of cash, and the willingness 
to live with higher than average market risk. 
sHort-terM turnarounds Rather than attempting to time the 
supply and demand cycle, you can better use your capital in real estate 
by buying properties that are depressed in price, fixing them up, and 
then reselling them. A property needing only cosmetic changes—
painting, roofing, and landscaping, for example—may be available for a 
price far below market value. Some time and effort can quickly turn your 
investment into a profit. In this situation, you don’t usually have to hold 
the property for several years to make a profit; you can turn it around in 
a matter of months.

PICKING THE BEST REAL ESTATE RENTALS 
Aside from the investigation into the demand for housing, rental rates, and 
market value, you also should be aware that the “best” value often depends 
on where the house is located and the type of house itself. As an 
income-generating asset, a specific house will vary in value based on its size 
and condition, specific neighborhood location, appearance, and age. 
Matching Houses to Tenants 
Tenants look for houses that match their income (translating to what they 
can afford) and can accommodate the size of their family. They are 
attracted to houses that are near work and that fit their specific lifestyle 
and desires. Each house will appeal to a specific type of tenant. A house in 
an upscale neighborhood with manicured lawns, fresh paint, and modern 
appliances and design is likely to appeal to a middle-class working couple 
with children. A small, rustic cabin out in the woods that’s away from 
traffic patterns will be more appealing to independent-minded, single, 
younger people, probably without children. Many tenants cannot afford to 
buy property on their own, but they want a yard where their children can 
play; they would like to get a dog or a cat, so they want a house rather than 
an apartment; and if they have several children, they want a larger house 
with more bedrooms. 
Age and Condition 
A house with a lot of deferred maintenance is going to be more expensive to 
keep in shape. It will also be more difficult to get top rents if the house is 
outdated, poorly insulated, poorly located, or in need of painting, yard 
maintenance, new flooring, and other work. One bit of wisdom advises that 
you should “buy the worst house on a good block.” This means that a poorly 
maintained house that needs cosmetic improvements is likely to increase in 
value more rapidly than its neighbors. This assumes that you get a discount 
in the price due to its condition. In comparison, buying a well-maintained 
house in a declining neighborhood is a poor investment; it will not hold its 
value well against other houses if the overall trend in that area is negative. 
So factors such as local employment, traffic patterns, crime statistics, and 
demographics all affect investment value of property. 

PicKing tHe best inVestMent for You 
[ 85 ]
Conformity 
Generally speaking, you should invest in properties that are similar to other 
properties in the same neighborhood. Nonconforming properties tend not 
to appreciate as well as the typical house. For example, if a neighborhood 
consists primarily of three-bedroom, two-bath, double-car-garage houses on 
a quarter acre, that is the standard. The typical house meeting that definition 
might cost $145,000, for example. If you find a house in such a neighborhood 
with five bedrooms, four baths, no garage, on one-half acre, and it is selling 
for $200,000, it is a nonconforming house in every respect (lot size, layout, 
and price). That nonconforming house, even while offering more in the way 
of features, is likely to be a poor investment. It will not appreciate at the 
same rate as other, conforming houses, and as a result, it would be a difficult 
house to resell. It may also be difficult to rent out due to your need to charge 
higher-than-average rents given the price. 
Conformity is more than just a concept. It defines investment value in the 
same way that rental income levels affect appraisal value. The higher the 
potential income, the higher the property will appraise, based on the income 
method. However, you would lose points for the nonconformity of a house. 
Even if an appraiser were to base the estimated value on finding similar 
houses, a downward adjustment would be made to conforming houses in the 
same or similar neighborhood, which would make it very difficult to justify 
a higher purchase price—and, ultimately, the level of selling price you would 
want to realize later on. Not only is price a problem; nonconforming houses 
are understandably also more difficult to resell. 
Neighborhoods 
You cannot avoid references to location in a discussion of value. The location 
of your investment property determines, more than anything else, what 
today’s value will be and how well that value will grow in the future. 
Even a difference of one block can significantly affect long-term value. If 
a house is located on an exceptionally busy street, it is highly visible but will 
not grow in value as well as an identical house only one block away from the 
arterial. A house in an older, established neighborhood will be far more 
valuable than a newer house in a less desirable area. 
“Less desirable” does not refer to anything as obvious as the neighborhood’s 
crime statistics, proximity to noise or traffic, or any other tangible 
characteristics of an area. Desirability of a neighborhood is a reflection of 
where people want to live. For a variety of reasons (some of which are 
intangible), a specific neighborhood will have greater status than another. For 
example, an older section of town where many old-time residents live may be 

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 86 ]
close to a neighborhood coffeehouse, pub, or grocery store. By comparison, 
more modern neighborhoods may not have the same “feel” to them. In many 
small towns and small to medium-size cities, this intangible effect can be 
witnessed time and again. Why is one neighborhood more desirable than 
another? There are as many answers as there are neighborhoods. As a real 
estate investor, you can recognize these variations in desirability only by living 
in the area long enough to be aware of them. You will probably never be able 
to understand all the reasons for that difference in desirability. 
Cost vs. Rental Value 
Another way to define what constitutes the “best” investment is through a 
comparison of cost and rental value. Clearly, the most desirable rental 
investment is one that costs as little as possible but yields the highest demand 
among renters. 
There is a tendency to think that high demand for property and associated 
growth in property values translates to a strong rental market. An in-depth 
analysis reveals that the two markets are quite independent and may even 
operate in opposition to each other. It is true that a large transient population 
(e.g., students or tourism workers) can create a seasonal fluctuation in rental 
demand. There may be nothing available in the summer months and high 
vacancies during the winter. From the investment point of view, this is an 
unhealthy condition. Ideally, there should be a year-round demand for 
housing to ensure that you can make your cash flow goals. 
In cities with large college populations, this is possible when the school 
has courses throughout the year. In cities with a high dependence on tourism, 
the colder months may be lean economically and across all job sectors. So a 
robust summer economy might be depressed in the off-season. As an investor, 
these seemingly subtle differences can spell cash flow disaster if you are not 
aware of the potential problems beforehand. 
THE ADVANTAGES  
OF MULTIPLE-UNIT HOUSING 
When real estate investors face the difficulty of cash flow in single-family 
housing (the most popular form of investment real estate), one solution may 
be found by investing in multiple-unit housing instead. This does not limit 
your choices to detached houses or ten-unit apartment buildings. There is a 
lot to choose from in between. 

PicKing tHe best inVestMent for You 
[ 87 ]
Two Can Be Better Than One 
The duplex—an attached two-unit property—is a far better choice for many 
markets than the single-family detached home. There are several reasons: 
 
The duplex appeals to many people who want a house. Tenants who seek a 
detached house often have children. They want to have the sense of living 
in a house, not an apartment. They may want to grow a garden or enjoy 
the yard in other ways, such as having a playground for their children or 
for pets. However, many families cannot afford the rent on an entire 
house, so the duplex is an attractive compromise. The duplex or triplex is 
also popular for student housing; it is nicer than an apartment but far less 
expensive than an entire house.
 
Many attractive attributes are found in the duplex. The duplex often has many 
of the attributes found in rental homes—a garage and storage space, a 
yard, a single-family living space, and more of a family-oriented 
neighborhood. The duplex, if located in a predominantly single-family 
area, is far more desirable from the tenant’s point of view than apartment 
living but far more affordable than renting a house. Utility costs also tend 
to be lower. The ability of tenants to attain the sense of being in a house, 
but at a price closer to that of an apartment, explains why these units are 
so popular. In many areas, apartment units and houses are plentiful but 
available duplex units are rare. So, from your point of view, the desirability 
of the duplex unit makes these safer investments. 
 
Duplex living is a step up from apartment living. Many tenants consider the 
duplex a significant step up from apartment living. This is especially the 
case when the duplex is designed to look like a house or is actually a 
conversion from a onetime single-family residence into two or more 
self-contained units. It’s important to remember that the majority of 
tenants want to own a house at some point in the future. Most people 
with families don’t want to live in an apartment complex any longer than 
necessary, and a duplex is definitely an improvement over the typical 
apartment unit. Many tenants who can afford to graduate from an 
apartment to a duplex see it as a step closer to home ownership. The 
maintenance cost of a duplex is virtually the same as that for a house. For 
you as landlord, the maintenance concerns and costs of a duplex are the 
same as for a detached house. They include yard work, utilities, systems 
upkeep, and outside (roof, siding, paint) maintenance. 
The efficiency of combined utility costs and yard maintenance makes 
it easier to meet cash flow. Landlords normally pay for garbage pickup 
and often for water, while tenants pay the remainder. As far as yard 
maintenance goes, one potential problem with the duplex is the question 

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 88 ]
of which tenant is responsible for it. Expecting two tenants to share the 
responsibility is asking for trouble; the responsibility has to be specified 
in the lease for one or the other if you expect to have it done efficiently. 
As an alternative, you can hire an outside landscaping service and pass on 
the cost to each tenant. 
 
There are insurance and tax savings. You need to insure your investment 
property against the possibility of fire and other catastrophic losses. As 
with utilities, insurance costs for a duplex are going to be lower—as a 
percentage of the rents you collect—than for a house. Insurance rates are 
based on the market value of the property, so a duplex that is about the 
same market price as a house will cost about the same to insure—even 
when rental income is far greater. 
The taxes on a duplex are going to be approximately the same as 
those on a single-family house or perhaps a little more. But if you 
compare the annual property tax bill as a percentage of annual rents, 
you will discover that duplex taxes tend to be far lower overall. For 
example, let’s say that you own a single-family house that you rent out 
for $700 per month, which is $8,400 per year. Annual property taxes 
are $900, which is 10.7 percent of annual rents. Or let’s say you own a 
duplex and each unit rents out for $450 per month. Your annual income 
is $10,800. If property taxes on the duplex are $1,000 per year, that 
represents 9.3 percent of rents. 
In this comparison, the duplex investment produces a lower tax burden. 
Because rents are higher, the property taxes are less of a burden. While 
you’re paying more for taxes on the duplex, taxes are a smaller percentage 
of rent income. 
 
Potential rental income for the duplex may be considerably higher than for a 
house. The most appealing point of comparison is in rental income. Even 
if one unit goes vacant, you continue receiving rent on the other. Rent 
levels vary by area, of course, but you may discover that the total rent you 
will receive from a duplex will be far greater than you could receive on a 
single-family house in the same neighborhood. For example, while a 
four-bedroom house may rent for $900, you may be able to rent two 
duplex units, each with two bedrooms, for $600 apiece, for a total of 
$1,200 per month. If the duplex costs the same as a comparably sized 
house, your cash flow in the duplex will be much higher. In addition, the 
lower unit rent of $600 opens your units to a far wider market, reducing 
the risk of vacancies. 
Of course, before investing in multiunit housing, it is wise to compare 
current market rates first, just to make sure that the rents are better. But 
if your area is typical, you will have better overall cash flow with duplexes 

PicKing tHe best inVestMent for You 
[ 89 ]
in almost every instance. The economy is even more improved with a 
triplex or four-unit building. 
 
Investment value may be better in duplex units. Single-family houses used as 
rentals tend to have a resale value about the same as owner-occupied 
housing. It is likely, in fact, that when you decide to sell your rental house, 
the buyer will be someone who intends to live in the house and use it as a 
primary residence. 
Many first-time home buyers are attracted to the duplex for this very 
reason. The affordability of home ownership is made easier when the new 
owner can recoup half of the mortgage cost by renting out the second 
unit. This also provides tax benefits and partial deductions of insurance 
and utilities—all advantageous for tax purposes. 
Appraising Market Value 
Multiple-unit rental property may have greater market value, especially in 
cities or towns with high rental demand and with strong property values. If 
you own a duplex or triplex, which is clearly rental property as opposed to 
primary residence property, it may be appraised on the income basis. The 
higher your rental income per month, the more likely that your duplex 
property will increase in value. Potential buyers—other landlords—seek 
properties with positive cash flow, and multiple-unit housing is the most 
desirable among residential properties. 
Appraising Apartment Buildings 
When you consider buying an apartment building as an investment, you 
must be aware of how the actual cost of the property compares to rental 
income. The gross rent multiplier (GRM) is used by appraisers for apartment 
buildings and is a useful comparative tool. The sales price is divided by 
monthly rents to arrive at GRM. For example, let’s say you are thinking of 
buying a property with an asking price of $410,000. Rents for all units add 
up to $3,000 per month. GRM is calculated as follows: 
$410,000 ÷ $3,000 = 136.67 
Appraisers compute GRM for several similar properties and then calculate 
the average. From this calculation, they next set market value under the 
income method. So, if the average GRM in your area were 131.36, the 
appraiser would calculate a thirty-unit building’s market value at $394,800 
(131.6 × $3,000). Based on the appraiser’s report, you would conclude that 
$410,000 is too much to pay, and you could make an offer of $394,800.

DEFINING YOUR SPECIFIC REAL ESTATE MARKET 
No one formula works in every market. Generalized valuation and demand 
factors cannot be applied to define the real estate market in your region. We 
all hear statistics about national housing prices rising or beating inflation, 
but that is a collective trend representing the net outcome for all regions. 
Some areas of the country have exceptionally strong real estate markets, 
whereas other areas are quite depressed. Some areas have seen real estate 
prices accelerate so quickly that it is difficult to enter the market as a landlord 
and create positive cash flow. Other areas have very affordable properties 
but little or no demand for rental units. So it is all a mix. 
Evaluate all of the conditions in your area. Remember, all real estate is 
local, and you cannot rely on the national averages to decide whether you 
are in a good real estate market. It is so local, in fact, that you cannot even 
depend on statistics from the next town to define real estate values where 
you live. You need to look at the specific facts where you plan to buy: the 
prices of property, the demand for rental units, the employment statistics 
and number of local employers, the typical age of residents (especially if 
heavily represented by college students or retired people, for example), the 
different neighborhood characteristics, and the crime levels and trends. 
looK at Yourself Finally, before going forward with any rental 
real estate investment, you should consider your personal situation—your 
income level, cash resources, credit rating, and, perhaps most important 
of all, your willingness to spend time caring for your rental property, fixing 
and repairing it as needed, and regularly dealing with your tenants. 
No one approach is going to work for everyone. Every region and city or 
town has different economic and demand features. Your personal risk 
tolerance and financial position further affect the type of property you will 
end up buying. Just as different stockholders will be drawn to one strategy 
or another in stock selection—varying by risk and growth potential, for 
example—different people will view real estate properties in varying degrees. 
The risk factors, added to your financial limitations and commitment level, 
will determine which properties will work best for you.

BOOKKEEPING BASICS  
FOR RENTAL PROPERTY
S
ome real estate investors make a dangerous assumption: The record- 
keeping part of the business is easy and can be done by a friend, a 
spouse, or an online system. These ideas are not bad ideas on their own 
merit, but if you lack the basic knowledge of how to keep records and why 
it is important, you could overlook some of the essentials. Many investors 
do not realize how complex real estate transactions can be, especially during 
times of repairs or working on fixer-upper properties.
MISTAKES WORTH AVOIDING
To start a discussion of basic bookkeeping, here are some useful guidelines:
1. If you don’t know anything about record keeping, hire someone 
who does.
2. Don’t make the mistake of thinking that software is a substitute 
for knowledge. If you don’t know how to keep books, admit it 
before you try to set up a system.
3. Don’t complicate matters; keep things simple. Complicated records 
inevitably become poorly kept records.
4. Set up a bank account only for real estate income and expenses. 
Do not keep records in which you mix business transactions with 
personal ones.
5. Back up your system with copies kept on a different drive.

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 92 ]
6. Study the results, and make sure you understand the tax planning 
aspects of your transactions.
SPECIAL SITUATIONS
You must meet special requirements for tracking and reporting rental 
activity. This is not difficult. It just means that you need to set up your 
record keeping so that you are able to comply with tax reporting requirements. 
A few special considerations make rental property bookkeeping different 
from most other types of business records. You need to allocate expenses 
between two or more rental properties and divide expenses when they apply 
partly to your personal residence and rental investments. In addition, some 
calculations do not apply to other types of investments (such as depreciation 
and a breakdown between mortgage principal and interest). 
TYPES OF TRANSACTIONS 
Most investors are aware of record-keeping requirements and tax reporting 
for capital gains, interest, or dividend income, and of limitations on claiming 
losses. When you also own real estate, you need to keep track of rental income 
as well as payments and expenses. Aside from the reporting rules, you also 
want to track cash flow and anticipate possible future problems. For example, 
if your rental property is financed with a variable-rate loan, an increase in 
your rate could mean a change from marginally positive cash flow to negative 
cash flow. Recognizing this problem, you are faced with the choice of raising 
rents or absorbing the negative number. The same problem can occur when 
your property taxes or utility bills are increased. Your rental agreement may 
provide that increases in property taxes will be automatically passed on to 
tenants, which will protect your cash flow. If utility expenses rise, you may 
either raise rents or pass on the utility burden directly to the tenant. 
EXAMPLE: One landlord faced rising utility costs and higher property taxes. 
However, the rental agreement was month-to-month rather than a 
lease, so there was no provision for passing increased costs on to the 
tenant. As an alternative, the landlord advised the tenant that, effective 
two months later, he would be responsible for the water and sewer bill. 
The tenant agreed. 

booKKeePing basics for rental ProPertY 
[ 93 ]
In this example, the landlord covered the increased costs by modifying the 
rental agreement. However, he did not increase the monthly rent. From the 
tenant’s point of view, the net result is the same, but accepting responsibility 
for a utility bill may be perceived differently. (Tenants may feel that they 
have more direct control over utility costs.) 
What to Record 
Record keeping helps you to anticipate changes in cash flow as well as to 
keep track of the required tax records. The transactions you should track 
include: 
 
 Rental Income. You need to record rental income you receive and deposit 
that income in your bank account. 
 
 Mortgage Payments. Your monthly rental property mortgage payment 
consists of principal and interest and, in many cases, property taxes and 
insurance as well. The mortgage principal reduces your mortgage debt, 
but it is not deductible. You need to calculate monthly interest expense. 
Some lenders break this down each month for you, but others do not. 
Therefore, you should know how to calculate this cost (see Chapter 2). 
The impounds you pay each month for property taxes and your insurance 
payments are rental expenses and should be recorded in the proper 
account. If you pay property taxes and insurance separately and not 
as part of your mortgage payment, those payments are recorded as 
expenses. 
 
 Utilities. If you pay utilities yourself, these payments are deductible as 
rental expenses. If your property is used partly as a rental and partly as 
your residence, then only the rental portion is deductible. The portion you 
can deduct is calculated based on usage. For example, if you rent out 30 
percent of your floor space, you can deduct 30 percent of the utilities. Or 
if you rent out your property for three months of the year, you can deduct 
25 percent of utilities paid for the entire year. 
 
 Advertising. Payments to advertise a property for rent are deductible. 
 
 Legal and Accounting Fees. You may need to consult an attorney regarding 
contract questions and tenant relations, and you may need help from an 
accountant or tax adviser to assist with your tax return and tax planning. 
These are deductible expenses when the consultation relates to your rental 
properties. 
 
 Auto Expenses. If you use a personal car or truck for rental activities, that 
portion of use is deductible as a rental expense. The most practical method 
for claiming a deduction for business use of your automobile is on a 
miles-used basis. Keep good records of mileage and actual use. 

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 94 ]
 
 Telephone. Like auto expenses, you can deduct business use of your 
telephone, but you need to keep thorough records to document that 
business use. 
 
 Office Expenses. You need to purchase record-keeping items such as 
accounting worksheets, binders, folders, and signs (to advertise properties 
for rent, for example). These expenses are deductible on your tax return 
as long as they relate specifically to rental property management activities. 
 
 Depreciation. The depreciation of properties is a noncash expense, which 
is calculated annually based on the cost of your property. You cannot 
depreciate the value of land, but all improvements in the building (e.g., 
any major additions and repairs) are depreciated annually. 
 
 Amortization. If you pay loan fees (also called points) when you finance 
your rental property, you may not be allowed to deduct that expense in 
one year. Points often have to be amortized over the life of the loan. For 
example, if you pay $2,700 in total points and your loan is scheduled to 
be repaid over thirty years, you are allowed to deduct $90 per year. 
Cash Accounting 
Most individuals report their income and pay taxes on a cash basis. That is, 
you report income and deduct expenses only in the period they are paid. So 
expenses such as property taxes can be deducted only when you pay them. 
If you are charged $400 in legal fees toward the end of December, but you 
do not pay the bill until January, the expense is deductible in the later year 
when you use the cash accounting basis. 
With rental properties, there are two exceptions to this rule: 
1. Rental income is deducted in the year the rent is earned, even if 
payment is early or late. So if your tenant pays January’s rent on 
December 30, it still is assigned to the following year. 
2. Interest works in the same way; you are allowed to deduct interest 
only in the period to which it applies. If you prepay your January 
mortgage payment hoping to get the additional interest expense 
into the current year, it will not work. It is deductible in the 
following year. 
MATCHING RENTAL INCOME AND BANK DEPOSITS 
Keeping track of rental income is a fairly simple process. The easiest way is 
to ensure that your bank deposits match your income. To keep your records 
as clear and as simple as possible, follow four rules: 

booKKeePing basics for rental ProPertY 
[ 95 ]
1. Set up an account to be used only for rental income and payments. Because 
you will have a volume of rental-related income, expenses, and payments, 
your bookkeeping will be clarified significantly if you set up a special 
account and use it only for rental activity. Some real estate investors try 
to track their income and payments through their existing accounts, but 
that is difficult to do consistently. Even if it costs you money to set up a 
new account, it is the best way to keep things clear. The bank charges are 
going to average about $7 per month on average, and you may even be 
able to make arrangements for free checking.1
2. Deposit all rental income into the investment account. It is most important 
that your deposits match your reported rental activity. All income you 
receive, whether made by check or cash, should be deposited into your 
investment account. In this way, your record of deposits will match what 
you report on your tax return. The “source document” for rent is going 
to be the rental agreement you sign with a tenant, but the real 
documentation is going to exist in the records you keep of bank 
transactions. The rental income you deposit in your investment account 
will be used for mortgage payments and other expenses; use the checking 
account as a simple way to keep track of all of your rental activity. 
3. Identify all nonrental deposits made. If your rental income falls short of 
your payment obligations, you will need to make additional deposits 
periodically. Be sure you identify those deposits specifically, in order to 
be able to explain the source of all deposits. Identify the deposit at the 
time you write it into your checking account. So when you deposit rental 
income, identify it as income (and if you have more than one rental 
property, you should also list the property address). When you transfer 
money from your personal account, identify it as a transfer. This will 
simplify your record keeping and reporting. A written record of changes 
in your account balance can be maintained in a traditional checking 
register, a journal like the one in Figure 5-1, or online in various formats. 
Today, many investors use software to track and maintain their books, 
for example. 
4. Set up a simple receipts journal, and keep it current. Your checking account 
is an excellent convenience for capturing all of your investment-related 
activity. (Incidentally, you can also use the same account to track 
investment activity in stocks and mutual funds by expanding the 
breakdown of deposits and payments. In this manner, all of your 
investment activity can be reported in a single record, and it is isolated 
from your personal records. This makes it easier to document what you 
report on your tax return, including rental income and payments, 
dividend and interest income, capital gains and losses, and transfers of 
capital in and out of other investments.) A comprehensive receipts journal 

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 96 ]
that includes space for tracking all of your investment activity is shown 
in Figure 5-1. Note that in this sample journal, rental income is identified 
by specific property; space has been allowed for up to four properties. 
You need this breakdown for your federal income tax return.
Software like Quickbooks and similar products are easy to use and 
have largely replaced the need for handwritten journals and ledgers. 
Books can also be maintained very simply on Excel and other spreadsheet 
programs.
iMPortant The total column should match your bank deposits 
without exception. It should also balance with the sum of all other 
columns, which is an additional procedure for double-checking your 
figures and keeping your receipts journal in balance.

Good Bookkeeping 
This procedure—keeping track of rental income through (a) your checking 
account and (b) the receipts journal—allows you to fully document all of 
your investment income throughout the year. The secret to effective 
bookkeeping is uniformity. If you have income from a number of different 
investments, you need to consolidate it in some manner. When it comes time 
to prepare your tax return, you do not want to have to scramble to figure 
out rental income for each property—and interest, dividends, and capital 
gains—while also trying to ensure that you don’t count a transfer as income 
by mistake. The simplified receipts journal ties your deposits to specific 
sources and makes the record uniform. A double-check is also available from 
your monthly bank statement, whether received in paper form on paperless 
and online. Make sure that the total reported by your bank agrees with the 
“total” column on your receipts journal. Any differences should be corrected. 
So, if you forget to write down a deposit halfway through the month, you’ll 
be able to find the error and fix it. 
BREAKING DOWN  
MORTGAGE PAYMENTS 
Keeping track of income is not a complicated matter. You need to put a little 
more effort into tracking payments, however. The largest payment you make 
each month is going to be the mortgage payment. Your monthly payment 
may consist of up to four different elements: mortgage principal (which 
reduces your debt balance), interest, and—if impounds are included—
additional amounts for property taxes and insurance. It is important to be 
able to break out these various segments of the mortgage payment in order 
to track both cash flow and profit and loss. Some lenders provide breakdowns 
of these payments each month; others do not. 
If your lenders do not provide you with a breakdown of each month’s 
payment, use a worksheet such as the one shown in Figure 5-2. This 
worksheet allows room for not only interest and principal but also for the 
impounds you may need to pay each month. As you write each month’s 
check for your mortgage payment, break it down so that your payments 
record can be kept up-to-date with accurate information.

Balancing Out Impounds 
Each month’s loan payment has to be broken down in your books according 
to the type of transaction involved. Impounds are collected by the lender and 
paid according to the due dates. For example, you may be required to make 
two payments a year on your property taxes and quarterly payments on your 
insurance policy. So the lender collects impounds and then makes timely 
payments for you. Using the previous example, the collection of impounds 
and payments may resemble the breakdown in Table 5-2. 
As long as your impound balances zero out during a single year, the 
easiest treatment is to simply assign them directly to the appropriate 
expense category—in this example, insurance and taxes. Two important 
notes concerning year-end adjustments: First, the impounds are 
approximations, so you probably need to adjust your year-end expense to 
reflect the actual total.

Second, if impounds include balances collected but not yet paid out, you 
need to defer the amounts collected to be applied to the following year. 
EXAMPLE: As of December 31, your lender collected $72.00 in insurance 
impound and another $297.00 for taxes. However, the actual payments 
for those expenses were not made and are not due until the following 
year. You should consult with your lender to reduce your insurance and 
property tax impounds throughout the coming year by those amounts, 
since the actual amount being claimed includes impounds not yet due. 

booKKeePing basics for rental ProPertY 
[ 101 ]
         Breaking Down Each Month’s Payments 
Adjustments to impounds should be made at the end of the year to keep 
monthly entries as simple as possible. As you make each mortgage payment, 
break it down and classify each portion of the expense based on either the 
summary your lender provides or your own worksheet. For example, the 
first month’s mortgage payment of $593.32 would be broken down among 
the various accounts for the specific property as shown on Table 5-3.

iMPortant The record of mortgage payments has to be further 
distinguished by property. If you own more than one rental property, you 
need to break down each expense by property because you are required 
to summarize it in that manner on your income tax return. It is also 
important to track cash flow for each property because you may have 
some positive and some negative cash flow properties.
RECORDING EXPENSES  
FOR RENTAL PROPERTIES 
The complication for rental properties is not only separating payments by 
type of expense but the additional requirement that you track expenses for 
each property. As long as expenses can be identified by the property itself 
(e.g., interest, taxes, utilities), this is easy to do. However, some expenses 
(such as office supplies, legal and accounting fees, auto and truck expenses, 
and telephone) cannot be as easily broken down by property. You need to 

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 102 ]
use a formula that makes sense on some basis. Allocating nonspecific 
expenses among two or more properties is explained later in this chapter. 
The process of recording expenses can become complex for multiple 
properties. A set of records can be maintained by hand in a series of journals 
and ledgers. These include books of original entry, known as journals, with 
summaries posted into a book of final entry, known as a general ledger. For 
multiple properties, the journals have to be maintained with separation 
between properties.
To simplify this process, check one of the several bookkeeping systems 
you can find online.

SIMPLIFIED RECORD KEEPING 
For those expenses easily identified for each property, the record-keeping 
rules can be simplified. Remember, you need two forms of distinction: (1) by 
type of expense and (2) by specific property. It makes sense to set up your 
records by type of expense and post payments to those expense accounts as 
they are made. Such a system can be set up within an automated accounting 
system or on a simple Excel worksheet. You need to also track expenses by 
property, so each expense account has to be subdivided by property address. 
Figure 5-3 shows a simplified bookkeeping format that allows you to 
segregate each expense and break it down by rental property. 
Year-End Summary 
The year-end summary is completed for each month. On an automated 
spreadsheet program, you could set up one “sheet” for each month, with one 

booKKeePing basics for rental ProPertY 
[ 103 ]
worksheet for each account, and track entries in that way. The year-end 
totals could then be transferred into a worksheet such as the one shown in 
Figure 5-4. This worksheet provides a summary that you can use to complete 
the expense portion of your federal tax return, Schedule E. (See Chapter 10 
for more details.)

SIMPLE METHODS FOR  
TRACKING CASH PAYMENTS 
A chronic problem for those operating their own businesses is the handling of 
cash transactions. Real estate investors are no exception. A potentially 
significant dollar amount of deductible expenses may be forgotten each year 
because the transaction takes place in cash. For example, when doing small 
repairs on a rental property, you make several trips to the hardware store to 
buy small tools, hardware, or parts. Each purchase runs $5 or less, and so you 
pay in cash, losing the receipt along the way. By the end of the job, you may 
have spent $50, collectively. If you do a repair job like that once a month, you 
lose track of $600 per year. This example may be only part of a larger problem. 
If you have several rental properties, it is all too easy to lose track of small 
expenses, so you need to devise a consistent but simple procedure. 
Saving Receipts 
In more formalized settings, like a business office, you would set up a petty 
cash fund, placing a set sum of money in a cash box and reimbursing cash 
expenses for receipts. Considering that the goal is to keep things simple, it 
should not be necessary to set up a petty cash fund. Instead, you can use a 
less formal procedure. Since you will normally use your car, van, or truck 
while out on real estate business, your cash transaction system can be 
operated out of your vehicle. The following four-point checklist is a 
suggestion for how the simplified cash system can work: 
1. Place a large mailing envelope (e.g., 9 ×12-inch in size) in your 
vehicle. 
2. Whenever you buy something related to your real estate 
investments, place the receipt in the envelope. Write on the receipt 
the type of expense and the property name. 
3. Once a month (or more frequently, if the volume is high), gather 
together the receipts, subtotal each expense classification, and 
reimburse yourself from your business checking account. In this 
way, the cash expenses go through your checking account and 
into your books. 
4. Document expenses immediately as they occur. Otherwise, you 
risk forgetting the specifics.
This simplified system gets you into the habit of filing receipts in the same 
place each time you spend money. Remembering to properly label each 

booKKeePing basics for rental ProPertY 
[ 105 ]
receipt also helps you assign each expense to the correct expense category 
and for the right property. 
Setting up a Cash Fund 
If you spend a large amount of cash, you could also place a small cash fund 
in the envelope. While this increases the chances for petty theft, it also 
makes it convenient to manage cash transactions. Most people find it easier 
to simply keep more cash in their pocket for such expenses. In general, 
though, you should work to minimize cash transactions because, even with 
a simple system like the one proposed, it is cleaner and easier to run as much 
as possible through your checking account. 
Opening an Account 
To help improve the situation, you can charge your purchases rather than 
pay cash. In this way, you pay for your purchases with one monthly check 
(when you pay your credit card bill) instead of making a higher volume of 
small purchases throughout the month. As you sign for each purchase, be 
sure to write down the property address on the voucher so that you will be 
able to break down your monthly bill by rental property. 
Use one credit card exclusively for your rental business expenses. Do not 
mix this with personal charges. Just as you need to set up a separate checking 
account, you also need to keep credit cards separate. Using the business 
credit card for small purchases solves the problem of cash transactions—as 
long as you keep daily records of what the expense is for and which property 
or properties to apply it to. To summarize the guidelines for the use of a 
credit card: 
 
Use one card exclusively for investment expenses. If you have two or more 
credit cards, use only one for your investment-related expenses. When you 
put gas in your car, purchase landscaping supplies, or shop at the hardware 
store, use the same card. Don’t use this card for any other purposes, 
except in emergencies. In this way, your monthly payment on the credit 
card is consistent, and you can easily keep track of business expenses as 
they occur. 
 
Keep receipts even when using your card, and match all purchases to your monthly 
statements. Just because you are charging your purchases does not mean 
you should throw away your receipt, for several reasons. First, you should 
always check your receipts against what gets charged to your account in 
order to make sure all of those charges are legitimate. Second, the receipt 
documents what you purchased and is necessary to complete your record 

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 106 ]
keeping. Third, the receipt may be necessary to allocate expenses among 
properties. For example, you may make a purchase at one store, but the 
items are allocated to two different properties. 
 
As an alternative, use a debit card on your business account. Some people don’t 
want to use their credit cards. Perhaps they don’t have an adequate line of 
credit, or they find it too much trouble to remember which credit card to 
use. In this case, you can use a debit card associated with your investment 
expense. The debit card is as convenient as writing a check, and the cash 
comes out immediately. Remember, though, you still need to keep the 
receipt to make the record of your transaction complete. 
 
Pay off the balance each month. Don’t let your investment credit card debt 
get out of control. Pay off the entire balance each month unless an 
exceptional situation arises (such as an unexpected, expensive repair). 
Having credit available is one way to manage cash flow, but you can use 
your card in that way only if you keep the balance under control. Paying 
off the entire balance is the same as if you were writing checks for each 
and every transaction. Don’t allow your balance to inch upward so that 
you end up with no credit available when you need it. 
ALLOCATING EXPENSES AMONG PROPERTIES 
Certain expenses cannot be identified by property. The larger expenses— 
interest, property taxes, utilities, and insurance—are easily and specifically 
tied to the property itself. However, legal and professional fees, office 
supplies, auto and truck expenses, and telephone charges are far more 
difficult to deal with. 
Year-End Allocation 
You are required to break down your rental expense by property, so you 
need to devise a method that makes sense and is also consistent for allocating 
nonspecific expenses. The most reliable method is to make allocations at the 
end of the year based on the level of rents collected. Performing allocations 
during the year is not advised; this makes more work and confuses the 
bookkeeping process. Keep it simple and straightforward month to month, 
and prepare a worksheet at the end of the year, such as the one in Figure 5-5, 
as part of your tax return, to allocate expenses. 

booKKeePing basics for rental ProPertY 
[ 107 ]
FIGURE 5-5. EXPENSE ALLOCATIONS WORKSHEET
Note that insurance is included on this form. The insurance expense that 
belongs to each property can be easily allocated, of course. The purpose for 
including insurance on the allocation worksheet is for forms of insurance 
that cannot be broken down by property, such as insurance on a vehicle that 
you use only for managing your rentals. 
The distinction between “supplies” and “office supplies” can be confusing 
as well. The type of items you would list under supplies includes hardware, 
drywall compound, paintbrushes, and small tools. The office supplies 
category includes the usual paper and pens, as well as letterhead, envelopes, 
stamps, printed checks and deposit slips, and other paper goods. 
Computing the Allocation 
The allocation is not difficult to compute. You just break down each year’s 
total in each expense classification using the same percentages as rents. 
EXAMPLE: You owned four properties during the most recent year. Rental 
income was $3,400, $3,785, $6,010, and $1,554. To arrive at a 
percentage breakdown, divide each rental total by the overall total 
($14,749): 
$3,400 ÷ $14,749 = 23.1%
$3,785 ÷ $14,749 = 25.7%
$6,010 ÷ $14,749 = 40.7%
$1,554 ÷ $14,749 = 10.5%

Applying the Allocation 
To apply these breakdowns for each expense, multiply the total by the 
applicable percentage. For example, if your legal and professional fees 
totaled $525 for the year, using the breakdown, you would assign the 
expense to each property as shown on Table 5-4.

What if you own a property for only part of the year? The allocation 
method is still reasonable because it shows a smaller rental total for the 
property and, as a result, a smaller dollar value as well. However, if you 
had an unusually large expense in the early part of the year and did not 
purchase an additional property until later, you could calculate two 
separate allocations: one for the period you owned three properties and 
another for the period of time you owned all four. Because the difference 
is probably going to be insignificant in most cases, it is a lot of extra work 
to calculate separate allocations, and it may even confuse rather than 
clarify the issue. The most reasonable approach is to apply an allocation 
for the entire year, consistently. The overall result will not change, so your 
tax liability is going to be the same no matter how you break down the 
allocation. 
USING THE NONALLOCATION METHOD 
An alternative is not to allocate these expenses at all but rather to show them 
in a separate column. On the Schedule E used to report rental income, you 
are asked to show each property’s results in its own column. You could 
include a column for nonallocated expenses. Using this method, you would 
report rental income, expenses, and profit or loss for each property, and then 

booKKeePing basics for rental ProPertY 
[ 109 ]
a last column, “unallocated expenses,” would have a total for each expense 
and a net loss. The columns are added together to summarize the net profit 
or loss. 
KeY Point The unallocated expense method keeps the books simple 
because no expenses are divided or assigned to specific properties. 
However, the process of evaluating cash flow for each property is more 
difficult. You need to perform your cash flow on all properties, but that 
is the method you probably use each month anyway. 
A suggestion: Evaluate cash flow each month based on a worksheet 
allocation of expenses, which allows you to look at each property objectively. 
But don’t make allocations in your books. Then at the end of the year when 
you prepare your taxes, you can consult with your tax adviser as to whether 
or not to allocate expenses. That allocation can be done on a worksheet, 
without complicating your bookkeeping. 
Nonallocation is easier than breaking down expenses. You should 
continue to assign expenses to specific properties as long as you can break 
them down easily. Therefore, utilities, interest, and property taxes should be 
assigned to their respective properties as payments are being made. 
Simplifying Depreciation with Nonallocation 
The nonallocation method also clarifies the treatment of depreciation for 
assets that are not unique to a particular property. Under the allocation 
method, you need to break out a portion of depreciation for each property. 
Expenses that may be nonspecific to property (for your auto or truck 
expenses, the costs of landscaping equipment and tools, for example) have 
to be allocated to each property individually. This complicates the question 
of depreciation significantly. When you sell a rental property, you are 
supposed to “recapture” the depreciation expenses you have claimed while 
you owned it. (This means the amount of depreciation claimed over the time 
you owned property is taxed upon sale of the property.) If you have claimed 
a portion of depreciation for nonspecific items, it confuses the calculation of 
recaptured depreciation expense. 
If you have a number of assets that cannot be assigned to each property, 
using the nonallocation method makes the most sense. Even if this is not a 
problem today, if you expect to own several properties in the future, you 
may want to establish a policy now that you will not allocate expenses to 
each property. This keeps everything much easier to track. 

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 110 ]
Year-End Tax Reporting 
One problem with nonallocation is that it does not allow you to show a net 
profit or loss on your tax return for each property. This does not affect your 
overall outcome because the net total of all properties is the profit or loss 
number that gets transferred to Form 1040 and on which tax is computed. 
Whether or not you allocate expenses, it is not wise to try to perform the 
allocation every month. The means for determining the breakdown—usually 
rental receipts—is likely to change throughout the year, so you would have 
to continually adjust the breakdown. Allocation should be a year-end 
calculation, done only once. This also keeps your books simple. 
EXAMPLE: You have three rental properties, and you are summarizing 
transactions as part of your year-end tax reporting. You do not want to 
allocate certain expenses. A summary of your annual rental income and 
expenses would look like the summary in Table 5-5.

In this example, nonallocated expenses were kept separate. While it would 
be a fairly simple matter to allocate these expenses, this method is clearer 
and cleaner. Because the net profit or loss on a capital gain is going to be 
based on the depreciated value of the property, depreciation expenses have 
to be divided among properties. However, any nonspecific depreciation can 
be kept in the nonallocated category and treated the same as other 
nonallocated expenses. 
Showing Nonallocated Expenses on Your Tax Form 
Nonallocation is not a preferred method for reporting taxes because it does 
not comply with the columns and format of the tax form. Even so, the net 
profit or loss continues to be reported, so there is no harm done by the 
nonallocation of certain expenses. And, even though the method does not 
exactly match the requirements of the tax form, it does comply with the 
provisions of the tax laws. You are required to report the net profit or loss 
from the activity and to show a breakdown by property of all revenue and 
expenses. Because nonallocated expenses cannot be directly assigned, they 
are treated as though they represent a separate property but only in the sense 
that they are given their own special column for reporting purposes. 
In the previous example, four columns are shown, plus a total column. 
The tax form where this information is reported (Schedule E of Form 1040) 
has only three columns. That doesn’t mean that all of the information has 
to be forced into three columns. When the information exceeds the capacity 
of the form, it is summarized on a supplementary schedule, and the totals 
are reported in the far-right column of the form. 
GETTING HELP— 
FINDING A QUALIFIED BOOKKEEPER 
Even if you are comfortable doing most of your own record-keeping chores, 
you may find it necessary to hire someone to formalize your books. You may 
already know how to record transactions and balance the books, but you 
may be one of the thousands of people who simply don’t enjoy bookkeeping, 
so it’s a bargain to pay someone else to do it for you. 
What guidelines should you follow in finding the right bookkeeper? Here 
are a few ideas: 
 
Check references. Any time you hire someone to work for you, it is essential 
to check references. Some people are not trustworthy, qualified, or 
competent, and it is expensive to discover that for yourself, after you have 

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 112 ]
hired them. Ask for professional references, including the two latest jobs, 
and check them thoroughly. If an applicant is not willing or able to provide 
references, don’t hire them. People are not always completely honest in 
what they tell you when applying for a job, so you must ensure that the 
person you are interviewing has experience. Ask them questions about 
bookkeeping: What have they done in the past? Have they worked with 
accountants in the area? (If so, that gives you more references to check.) 
Are they full-charge bookkeepers? (A full-charge bookkeeper is supposed 
to be qualified to do all the bookkeeping entries, including the final entries 
at the end of each month.) 
 
Find someone with experience in real estate. When it comes to recording 
transactions, keeping records, and breaking down expenses, the rules for 
real estate are different from most other types of businesses. You need 
someone with experience in rental bookkeeping. While this is not 
absolutely essential, it is an advantage. A person who understands how to 
allocate real estate expenses and why it is so important will have an 
advantage over someone you will have to train. 
 
Consider using a management company’s services. If you cannot find a qualified 
bookkeeper in your area, you may want to check with a local real estate 
management company. These companies handle all of the details of 
rentals—from bookkeeping to filling vacancies and fielding tenant 
problems—for landlords who don’t want to deal with these matters 
themselves or who live far away and cannot. Some of these companies may 
be willing to quote you a price for keeping your books. They usually charge 
between 8 percent and 12 percent of rents collected for complete services, 
including finding tenants, collecting rents, and keeping the books.
 
Coordinate the bookkeeping routines with your tax adviser. Your tax adviser 
should not be someone whom you see only once a year. You may also need 
midyear tax-planning advice, so make an appointment to plan ahead. In 
the course of managing your taxes, you can also ask your tax professional 
where you can find a qualified bookkeeper. The tax adviser may know 
someone or, if a member of a large firm, may have an in-house bookkeeping 
service. This can save you a lot of time and trouble. Your tax adviser won’t 
have to depend on an outsider’s bookkeeping to determine what is going 
on; the same adviser can supervise how the books are set up and how 
month-end and year-end summaries are recorded. 
 
Be aware of employment rules. Make sure the individual you hire understands 
that the arrangement is not an employment agreement. That means they 
are responsible for their own insurance and taxes. In some situations, you 
could get into a lot of trouble if you don’t have a specific agreement and 
the person complains to the tax authorities that you did not withhold 

booKKeePing basics for rental ProPertY 
[ 113 ]
taxes, worker’s compensation, or unemployment insurance. Therefore, get 
your agreement in writing, specifying that the individual’s status is as an 
independent contractor and that the agreement is not an employment 
contract. 
If you decide to hire someone as an employee, you should first check 
into record-keeping and reporting requirements. Having an employee is a 
complex administrative and bookkeeping challenge. You must make 
periodic deposits for payroll taxes and pay approximately 12 percent of 
payroll for federal and state insurance and Social Security. You must also 
pay workers’ compensation insurance. For all of these reasons, it is far 
more efficient and cheaper to hire a bookkeeping service and not an 
employee. 
 
Hire someone you are comfortable with. No matter how qualified a 
bookkeeper might be, you should be comfortable with the person. You 
want to be able to talk about your books and ask questions. The 
bookkeeper, too, must be comfortable working with you. If there is 
tension in the relationship, you will not enjoy meeting with your 
bookkeeper. You also will not be able to get the information you need 
and deserve. 
 
Pay attention to what is being done. One of the greatest mistakes any investor 
or small business owner can make is letting someone else do the books 
without paying attention. You should ask questions, review work, and 
make sure you understand exactly what is going on with your books. You 
are responsible for keeping records even if you hire someone else, so you 
need to ensure that the information is being recorded accurately and 
properly. 
WatcH tHis Some investors think it is efficient to let their bookkeeper 
sign checks. This is not a smart idea. You invite trouble when you give 
someone else unlimited access to your funds. Signing the checks is a 
good control point, where you can ask questions if you’re unsure about 
anything—or want to know what is being paid, for example. Not everyone 
will embezzle just because they have the opportunity, but why invite 
trouble? Sign your own checks, and supervise the entire bookkeeping 
operation regularly.

THE RENTAL AGREEMENT 
In thinking about various types of documentation (receipts, invoices, 
statements), it is common to view investment activities in terms of the usual 
tax rules. You need a document to verify the expense. For rental activity, you 
also need to document the fact that an agreement existed for the period you 
claim deductions. 
You can verify expenses to a degree with utility records that show where 
you and your tenants receive mail. Going beyond this, though, you also need 
to enter a written agreement with your tenant that defines what you have 
agreed upon. Your rental contract defines the beginning date of your rental, 
the amount of rent the tenant is supposed to pay, any deposits given to you 
and what they are for, which utilities the tenant pays, and other important 
terms. In addition to being an important legal document, the rental contract 
is also a form of documentation for tax purposes. It establishes that a 
contract existed between landlord and tenant. 
CONFORMING TO THE LAW 
Laws vary from one state to another. The specific terms you put in your 
rental agreement should be reviewed by a real estate attorney to ensure that 
your requirements conform with local laws. For example, some states require 
twenty days’ notice if you or your tenant want to terminate the agreement; 
other states require thirty days. You cannot waive the legal requirement. 
Even if you and your tenant agree to twenty days’ notice, but your state 
requires thirty days, that is the rule. If one side or the other makes a 
thirty-day notice, that conforms with the law. 
A typical rental agreement for a month-to-month rental is shown in Figure 
5-6. Remember, though, that the specific rules in your state may require 
modification to some of the terms listed. 
Some Problems to Watch For 
The rental agreement is a contract. Of course, it is designed to cover most 
of the common problems that can arise between landlord and tenant, but 
it cannot possibly cover everything. Disagreements can and do arise, and 
some areas of conflict seem to be more common than others—no matter 
how carefully the rental agreement is worded. These common problem 
areas include: 

FIGURE 5-6
Rental Contract 
This is a rental agreement for a month-to-month rental between _____________________________ 
_________________________________ (tenant) and _______________________________ (landlord), for 
property located at ________________________________ in the city of _____________________________ 
_____________________________. The rental terms begin on ____________________ and will 
continue until one side provides written notice to terminate the agreement. Such notice will be 
provided no less than __________ days before the intended date of moving. The landlord agrees to 
refund all deposits due to the tenant as specified below within __________ days after the property 
has been vacated. 
The monthly rent is payable on the __________ day of each month in the amount of $__________ 
per month. The security and cleaning deposit is payable on the date this agreement is signed in 
the amount of $__________. This deposit will be returned upon completion of this agreement and 
subject to the tenant’s returning of keys and completion of a walk-through inspection by the 
landlord and a return of property condition to its original condition. Any cost of cleaning or 
repair will be deducted from this deposit, explained, and the remaining balance refunded. No 
portion of this deposit may be applied to rents remaining due upon termination of this agreement. 
Residents of the property are limited to the following persons: 
No additional persons may reside at this address under the terms of this agreement, without written 
permission from the landlord and renegotiation of a new rental agreement. No pets are allowed at 
this address unless preapproved by the landlord and subject to an additional pet deposit. 
The tenant also agrees to the following rules: 
a. The outside areas will be maintained in current condition, including lawn and yard 
maintenance. No personal property will be left in the yard or on the porch area. 
b. The tenant will not paint or perform other repairs or modifications to the property without 
prior written consent from the landlord. 
c. The landlord has the right to inspect the property, make repairs, or show the property to 
prospective buyers in the event a sale is pending, or to new prospective tenants if this agreement 
is in the process of ending, provided that the landlord will provide _______ days’ notice in advance 
and make an appointment to have access to the property. 
d. Rents will be submitted by mail or in person on the due date and at the owner’s address. 
e. No motor vehicles in excess of _______ vehicles will be kept at the property. All vehicles kept 
at the property will be currently licensed and registered. No repairs of motor vehicles are allowed 
at the property. 
f. The tenant will pay for all repairs for damages caused by the tenants, their children, or 
guests. If the landlord pays for such repairs, the tenant agrees to reimburse the landlord by 
payments on a schedule agreed upon by the landlord and tenant. 
g. The tenant will not change locks without prior written permission from the landlord. Upon 
termination of this agreement, the tenant agrees to provide the landlord with two key sets for the 
changed locks. 
h. Other: Violation of any of the terms of this contract may result in the landlord beginning 
eviction proceedings. The tenant has read this agreement, understands its terms, and has been 
given a copy of the agreement. This agreement also represents a deposit receipt according to the 
terms above. Other agreements that are part of this contract include a Statement of Condition 
and ______________________________________________________________________.

Due Date of Rent. Tenants may have a relaxed attitude about the date the 
rent is actually due. From your point of view, the mortgage payment is 
usually due on the first, so it would be nice to collect rents on the same 
day. If you do not specify the due date with the tenant, the payment may 
slip. If you do not enforce the agreed-upon due date each month, the 
tenant may fall so far behind that it will be impossible to catch up. 
 
Residents Allowed in the Property. Every house has a limited amount of space. 
A very small property will be appropriate for a limited number of people, 
so the rental agreement is designed specifically to limit the number of 
people who are allowed to live on the premises. Some tenants with large 
families will initially represent that there are only two people, only to 
move three or four more people in later. The problem with this is that 
there will be more wear and tear on the property; in addition, it is not fair 
to you when tenants deceive you about the number of people living in your 
property. This is why the contract includes space to list everyone. It allows 
you to enforce the terms later if more people move into the property. You 
need to be sure that you don’t violate local laws when limiting the number 
of people who can live in your property. Some states’ rules forbid 
discriminating against families with children, for example, so you cannot 
reject an application solely because your tenant has children. The criteria 
must include a reasonable argument about the size of the property and the 
number of people who can live within that space with that many bedrooms 
and baths. 
 
Responsibility for Yard Maintenance and Provision of Tools. Tenants often want 
to occupy a house but do not own a lawn mower and other yard tools. As 
landlord, you probably don’t expect to provide these tools for your 
tenants, so this is one possible area of conflict. Some tenants might expect 
the landlord to buy a lawn mower for them. You need to clarify the fact 
that the tenant is responsible for yard maintenance, and this invariably 
includes mowing a lawn, weeding, trimming, and performing other yard 
routines. Logically, this also means having to buy the needed tools, renting 
them, or asking a friend for help. Some landlords gladly lend their mower 
to the tenant or leave a spare mower on the premises. But lacking these, 
the tenant has to assume responsibility for making arrangements necessary 
to maintain the yard areas. 
 
Rent Offsets. Some tenants think it is reasonable to barter for some of the 
rental obligation. This usually means they cannot afford the rent you are 
asking. If this comes up in the application phase, it is a warning sign. If it 
comes up later, it may be troubling, but you have to remain firm. The full 
amount of rent is due. None of that rent can be exchanged for performing 
work around the property or otherwise working for you. Chances are, you 
will never have enough work to keep the tenant busy, even if you wanted 

booKKeePing basics for rental ProPertY 
[ 117 ]
to. In addition, you already have a specific contract with your tenants; 
complicating that agreement with a working relationship raises all sorts 
of potential trouble. What if they injure themselves? Are you liable for 
providing insurance or withholding taxes? What if you’re unhappy with 
their work and want to fire them? Any number of conflicts can come up, 
so you are better off keeping the landlord–tenant relationship as simple as 
possible. The two most common areas that come up in the bartering offer 
are landscaping and painting. Since the tenant is already responsible for 
landscaping, there is no room for negotiation on that count. Most people 
who have never painted a house think it is an easy job, but they soon find 
out it is far more work than they think. Landlords should never give 
permission for tenants to paint inside or out, even if they want to perform 
the work for free. You need to maintain control over color choices, quality 
of work, and timing. Tenants may start out working for free, only to later 
decide they should be paid for their efforts—another potential conflict 
area worth avoiding. 
 
Automobiles on the Premises. You want to restrict the number of cars that 
tenants are allowed to have parked on or near your property. This 
restriction should include a limitation on the number of vehicles, a rule 
that the vehicles have to be registered, and a ban on working on vehicles 
on the premises. Without these rules, it is too easy for tenants to make a 
mess of your property, not only visually but environmentally as well. Your 
neighbors will not appreciate the problems, and the conditions may also 
violate local zoning rules. Including vehicle restrictions in your rental 
contract is important, if only because the problem does arise from time to 
time. 
 
Application of Security Deposit to Rents. When they want to end their 
relationship with you, tenants may decide to apply their security deposit 
to the last month’s rent. This means that if they do not clean the property 
or if damage has been done, you have no recourse in collecting the costs 
from the security deposit. However, by the time the tenant has decided not 
to pay the last month’s rent, it is really too late to prevent this. By the time 
you would be able to take action to collect unpaid rent, the tenant will be 
gone and there would be no point in proceeding. 
If the property is left damaged and no security deposit was collected, 
you can file a small claims action, but even with a judgment, collection 
will be a problem. Unless the damage is significant, the effort will not 
necessarily be justified by the dollar amount of damages. A far more 
sensible approach is to require tenants to prepay the last month’s rent as 
well as the security deposit, although this will create a hardship for many 
tenants. They will need to pay the first and last month’s rent plus a 
security deposit in order to move in. Depending on the condition and age 

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 118 ]
of the property, the neighborhood, and the tenant’s references, you may 
be willing to forego the last month’s rent requirement. If this rule translates 
to having longer periods of vacancy (because fewer people can afford to 
put down that much money), it will not be worthwhile—especially if 
other landlords are not requiring the first and last months’ rent as part of 
their conditions for moving in. 
 
Conditions for Return of Security Deposit. The security deposit is intended as 
a fund to ensure that tenants do not damage your property, fail to return 
keys, or leave without cleaning. Even so, some tenants will cause 
considerable damage and fail to clean up and still expect to be given their 
security deposit. You may need to clarify the intent of the deposit. One 
solution to this potential problem is to advise tenants that when they are 
ready to vacate, you want to do a walk-through inspection with them. At 
this time, you can check conditions and let tenants know of any repairs or 
cleaning that still need to be done. You can also inform them that in order 
to get their security deposit back, those repairs and cleaning chores need 
to be completed. This step helps to improve communication and ensures 
that tenants know the terms of vacating the property. 
THE STATEMENT OF CONDITION 
A second form, usually a part of the rental agreement, is the statement of 
condition. This is a listing of any and all defects and other conditions of the 
property, an inventory of any furniture or appliances included with the 
property, and other notes agreed to by both tenant and landlord. The form 
should be completed by the landlord as a walk-through of the property is 
performed with the tenant. This form could be multipage and list every 
possible condition, or it could be fairly simple, with only specific notations 
made. A sample of the simplified version of the Statement of Condition is 
shown in Figure 5-7.
Protection for Landlord and Tenant 
The purpose of the Statement of Condition form is to document the exact 
condition of the property in order to protect both landlord and tenant. If 
there are any flaws in condition, these should be noted on the form. During 
the walk-through, the tenant has a chance to point out flaws that should be 
written down, such as chipped trim, holes in the walls, worn carpets, or 
missing and broken tiles. When the tenancy ends, the Statement of Condition 
can be referred to as the source of information about who is responsible for 

FIGURE 5-7

[ 120 ]
repairs. The same logic applies to appliances. If appliances are not clean 
when the tenant first sees them, this should be noted on the Statement of 
Condition. The landlord should deliver the property in clean condition. It 
would not be fair to turn over the property in less than clean condition and 
then expect the tenant to clean up upon vacancy. 
The same protection works for the landlord. If the property is spotless 
and all fixtures are in clean and working order, this has to be noted on the 
Statement of Condition. If the tenant breaks anything or damages appliances 
or fixtures, you then have the right to deduct repairs and cleaning from the 
security deposit. There are some exceptions: 
 
Normal Wear and Tear. You expect carpets to wear out after a few years, and 
you also expect to need to repaint interior walls. These are examples of 
normal wear and tear. A tenant who has occupied the premises for many 
years should not be expected to pay for new carpeting that is several years 
old. You would expect a tenant to fill holes in the wall where they have 
hung paintings, but you would not expect them to pay for a new paint job 
in a room that hasn’t been painted for many years. 
 
Appliance Breakdown. Landlords often put used appliances in their rentals. 
The cost of new appliances is prohibitive, and the number of appliances 
can be staggering. For example, if the typical house includes a refrigerator, 
dishwasher, washer, dryer, and range—a total of five appliances—that is 
a considerable investment. If you own four rental properties, that adds up 
to twenty appliances. Rather than paying for brand-new units, you will 
probably purchase used appliances, in which case you have to expect them 
to break down at some point.
A broken appliance is often not worth fixing. More likely, you will 
place another used unit in the home if your tenant reports a breakdown. 
It would not be fair to expect the tenant to pay for repairs or replacements, 
considering that you are providing them with used appliances. You can 
find used appliances that are in good working order for far less than the 
prices you’d pay for new ones.
 
Structural and System Flaws. You cannot expect your tenants to take 
responsibility for flaws in the building itself. Examples include maintenance 
of heating and air-conditioning systems, roofing and siding, outside paint, 
and electrical and plumbing systems. All of these are the landlord’s 
responsibility in most cases. If tenants were to break something by using 
systems other than as intended, they would be responsible. For example, 
if a tenant decides to rewire the house and your electrical system needs to 
be repaired as a result, the repair would be the tenant’s responsibility. 
However, normal problems and periodic maintenance, such as changing 
filters in your heating system, are your responsibility.

[ 121 ]
KEEPING YOUR RECORDS SIMPLE  
BUT EFFECTIVE 
The legal contracts you need are the beginning of documentation for the 
terms you and your tenant agree upon. Next, you want to create a method 
for keeping track of the money that changes hands each month. When you 
think about the purpose in setting up your books in a particular way, what 
is the real goal? You want an effective set of books that is easy to maintain, 
that is easy to track and explain, and that takes as little time as possible to 
update. Few real estate investors want to spend a lot of time maintaining 
their bookkeeping system. They would rather be doing other things. 
If your bookkeeping and taxes are too complex, you may want to pay a 
bookkeeper to maintain your records and a tax expert to fill out your tax 
forms each year. However, by applying a few basic rules, you can probably 
keep your own books—at least when you first begin investing in real estate 
or own one property. Later on, if you own numerous properties and have 
many transactions each year, including the sale of properties, you may need 
to hire expert help. 
suMMarY of KeY Points 
• Set up a separate bank account, deposit all rental income, and run all 
payments and expenses through the account. This is the basis of 
keeping clear and accurate records. 
• Keep all receipts, filed by type of expense or by vendor. This way, your 
records are kept in one place and—with relatively little time invested— 
you can keep the books simple but thorough. 
• Handle cash expenses consistently, collecting receipts in an envelope you 
keep in your vehicle, and reimburse yourself periodically by writing a check 
from your investment account. This helps to keep your books consistent 
and minimizes the chances that you will overlook a legitimate deduction. 
If your records are too much to handle, or if you are spending too much time 
struggling with your bookkeeping, ask for help. Hire a bookkeeping expert, 
either to do the work for you once a month or to show you how to improve 
your system so that it is easier to maintain. If you continually struggle with 
the process, you are better off paying for the help you need. If you understand 
the process but do not enjoy maintaining the records, consider automating 
your books, using an informal system like Excel worksheets or a flexible but 
easy-to-use accounting program you find online.

KEEPING TRACK OF  
REAL ESTATE  
TRANSACTIONS
M
any of the bookkeeping standards for rental property are different 
from those for other businesses. For many first-time real estate 
investors, the difficulty arises from the mix between personal and investment 
uses of property. 
If you begin by converting a home that you use yourself—a vacation 
home, for example—you need to track personal and investment use carefully. 
You also need to document how you break down the usage. Probably the 
most reliable method is to record the number of days the property is assigned 
to personal use and to investment use. 
A second problem arises when you convert a property during the year. 
Some people find themselves in the real estate business when they move from 
their current house to a new one. Instead of selling their existing primary 
residence, they convert it to a rental. This decision used to be made to avoid 
taxes on a sale. However, under current federal rules, you are allowed to sell 
your primary residence tax free. This rule applies up to $500,000 in profit 
(for a married couple) or $250,000 (for a single person), as long as you have 
used the property as a primary residence for at least twenty-four months 
during the past five years. 
This tax-free sale provision in the law is a considerable benefit for 
homeowners. There is no limit on the number of times you can sell your 
primary residence, as long as you have used that home as your primary 
residence for at least twenty-four months. As you can have only one primary 
residence, the timing is restricted. But compared to the past, when you had 
to buy a home of equal or greater value to defer taxes, the current rule is 
more favorable. For many empty nesters, needing a smaller home once 

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 124 ]
children leave home, the past requirement meant that the overly large home 
had to be kept or, upon its sale and relocation to a smaller home, a large tax 
burden had to be met.
Even with the ability to escape taxes on the profit from selling your home, 
you might decide to convert to a rental for extra income. For example, the 
current market may not be strong enough to produce a profit from the sale 
of your current home. Converting it to a rental is one method for delaying 
the decision to sell until the market price rises. Of course, given the time 
restriction for avoiding taxes on a profit, you could end up paying capital 
gains tax on the property later. If five or more years pass, you would not be 
allowed to enter into a tax-free sale. In that case, one solution would be to 
move back into the home for twenty-four months and then sell with no tax 
liability. 
Under any circumstances in which a specific property is a combination of 
personal and investment use, careful documentation is essential. If you 
convert your residence during the year, some portion of expenses will be 
personal (interest and taxes, for example, will be itemized deductions), and 
the rest of the year will represent investment expenses.
KeY Point Some expenses are both personal and investment related 
to some degree. These expenses must be broken out and documented 
properly. The time may come when you will need to explain how you 
decided to assign a portion of an expense between personal and 
investment use. 
SEPARATING PERSONAL AND  
INVESTMENT EXPENSES 
The solution to the mixed-use problem is documentation. You must contend 
with this problem in one of three circumstances: 
1. When an expense includes both business and personal usage 
2. When a property is used only part of the year as an investment 
3. When a property is used year-round, partly as your residence and 
partly as a rental 

KeePing tracK of real estate transactions 
[ 125 ]
Business/Personal Mix 
Some expenses can include both personal and rental portions. Some 
examples: 
Automobile Expenses. You may use your personal automobile for rental 
activities. For example, you need transport to examine potential rental 
properties; to make trips to collect rents; to meet with prospective tenants; 
to take garbage to the dump; to move appliances or furniture; to keep an eye 
on the property; and to visit your accountant, attorney, or real estate broker. 
Any investment use of your automobile is deductible as an investment 
expense. If you use your personal car or truck in this manner, the most likely 
method for calculating a deduction is going to be based on the precise 
number of miles. You are allowed to claim a specific amount per mile as a 
deduction. You need to keep a log of your automotive expenses, which 
includes the date, destination, miles traveled, and purpose of each trip. Use 
an expense log such as the one shown in Figure 6-1.
FIGURE 6-1. AUTOMOBILE LOG

To claim a deduction based on mileage, you must have owned the vehicle 
and used the mileage method in the first year of ownership (you cannot 
switch back and forth between mileage and depreciation methods). If you 
lease your vehicle, you have to use the standard mileage method for the 
entire lease period.

deductibility and documentation of automotive expenses, download the

The alternative method includes calculating the business portion and then 
deducting the applicable cost of gas and oil, repairs, insurance, new tires, 
license and registration fees, and depreciation. This method is more complex 
than the calculation based on mileage but could result in a higher deduction, 
especially if you use your automobile extensively to manage rental properties. 
The standard mileage allowance changes from year to year (the IRS 
releases the new figure in January for the previous year). As of 2015, the 
standard mileage rate was 57.5 cents per mile. This mileage allowance does 
not include parking fees and tolls, which are added separately. Whichever 
method you use, if it involves more than one vehicle, you have to perform 
the computations and keep records for each vehicle. If you own several rental 
properties, it could make sense to buy a truck and use it exclusively for real 
estate activities. 
Landscaping Equipment. Some rather simple acts can complicate your 
bookkeeping. For example, if you own a riding mower that cost $1,200 and 
you use it occasionally to mow the lawn of your rental property, a deduction 
has to be figured. Based on the degree of usage, this equipment is partly a 
personal asset and partly an investment asset. There is no deduction for 
personal use, but as an investment asset you are entitled to depreciation 
expenses. However, you can depreciate the asset only to the degree that it is 
used as part of your investment activity. If you have only your own lawn and 
the rental property lawn and you use the mower equally for each, the 
breakdown is probably fifty-fifty. This is a simple calculation. But the 
question is complicated if the circumstances are not so straightforward. For 
example, if your rental property is two acres but your personal property lies 
on a 50×100-foot lot, then your investment expense is much higher. You may 
need to mow 80,000 square feet of lawn at your rental property, versus only 
3,000 square feet at your home. In this example, investment expense would 

KeePing tracK of real estate transactions 
[ 127 ]
be 96 percent of the total (80,000 feet divided by 83,000 feet). This 
breakdown would be easily documented, especially if you had purchased the 
riding mower specifically to take care of the rental property. In such a case, 
it would simplify your bookkeeping to purchase the riding mower as an 
investment asset and use a smaller, cheaper mower for your residence. 
This example illustrates that some decisions you need to make in managing 
your real estate investments can create complexities. You could end up with 
a considerable investment in landscaping equipment—mowers, garden tools, 
soil and treatments, and more—especially if you own more than one rental 
property. Keeping these items separate from your personal-use items helps 
to keep your books clean and simple. 
Cell Phone. Your cell phone expenses have to be split between personal use 
and investment-related activities. Due to the nature of investment business, 
your deductible expenses will probably be minimal.  If you can document a 
substantial portion of investment-related phone usage, you could justify 
deducting a portion of the monthly service charge and data usage. If you claim 
investment use of your personal telephone, you must maintain a telephone log 
and be able to identify those calls directly related to investment activity.  
Office Supplies. The office supply requirements for running your property 
operation are going to be limited, though your setup expenses could be 
considerable. These expenses include paying your bank for printing checks 
and purchasing a supply of paper, rent receipt forms, accounting worksheets, 
and other office tools. These expenses should all be paid for out of your 
business account and kept separate from the items you use at home. 
When you buy items you use for operating your investments, you should 
purchase them separately from other, personal items. While the amount of 
money involved is probably going to be small, it is a good record-keeping 
habit to establish. 
If you purchase a combination of business and personal items, break the 
purchases out on your receipt. When information is entered in the books, 
the portion that goes to personal use should be identified as draw (i.e., 
money drawn out of the investment funds for personal use) and not as an 
expense. However, it is cleaner and easier to document if you make separate 
purchases, one from a personal account and the other from your business 
account or credit card.
Professional Fees. Everyone needs to use the services of an accountant, a tax 
expert, or an attorney at some point. You need to break down combined use 
so that you claim only those expenses that you are allowed to as investment 
expenses. 

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 128 ]
For example, your attorney may advise you on tenant issues, approving 
the rental application, rental contract, and other forms you use to ensure 
that they comply with local and state laws. The attorney may also help you 
if you ever need to evict a tenant or go to court for other disputes. At the 
same time, your attorney advises you on writing your will, buying or selling 
property, and other issues not related to your rental activity. Therefore, the 
attorney’s bill must be itemized as well. The nondeductible portion has to be 
excluded as an expense and identified in your payment as a draw. Or, if the 
amounts are large enough, you can write two checks to the attorney and 
even request separate invoices. The payment from your investment account 
would pay only for deductible expenses, and your personal check would 
cover everything else. 
The same rule applies if you use the services of an accountant. However, 
it gets more complicated because preparing your return includes both 
personal and investment schedules. You may need to ask your accountant to 
estimate the breakdown for you, identifying the portion of the fee that 
applies to real estate activities. That portion can then be paid from your 
investment account and the balance paid from your personal account. A 
similar breakdown may be necessary if you meet with your accountant 
during the year for any tax planning and related discussions. Ask the 
accountant to estimate the time that applies to real estate activities so that 
your payment can be applied easily. 
Home Office. Rules for using an office in your home are very specific, and 
the terms for deducting these expenses are difficult to meet. It is also worth 
noting that claiming an expense for an office in your home can serve as a 
red flag for possible audit. Given the likelihood that the amount will be 
small, it may not be worth the trouble to claim this deduction. 
The general rule for qualifying a home office deduction is: You must use 
a specific space 100 percent of the time and 100 percent for business use. 
Having a desk in the corner of the dining room doesn’t qualify because the 
dining room is used for other purposes. You would have to use a room for 
no purposes other than keeping track of investment properties. That means 
you could not use that same room as a guest room, for example. 
The deduction would be limited as well. If your home office is 400 square 
feet and the total space in your home is 2,400 square feet, you can deduct 
one-sixth of home expenses, including utilities, insurance, taxes, mortgage 
interest, and depreciation. Considering the limitations, the total deduction 
is going to be quite small and probably not worth the effort or the exposure 
to possible scrutiny by the IRS. If you decide to deduct the home office, be 
prepared to carefully and thoroughly document how you arrive at the 
amount of expense you claim as a deduction.

Part-Year Rentals 
If you own a second home or vacation home, you may find it desirable to rent 
it out for part of the year. This is a sensible way to cover part of your costs and 
to obtain tax benefits at the same time. You need to divide all expenses on the 
basis of personal versus investment use. For example, if you always spend three 
winter months in your second home and rent it out for the rest of the year, you 
are entitled to a three-quarters deduction of annual investment expenses. 
The property has to be available as a rental for the entire period you 
intend to deduct investment expenses. It is not enough that the house is 
empty. It has to be advertised and available. So, if you advertise the house 
for nine months but only rent it out for five of those months, you should still 
be able to claim three-quarters of the annual expenses as investment related. 
This relates specifically to property taxes, interest, and insurance. (Property 
taxes and interest are included as itemized deductions for the period of 
personal use, but no other expenses are deductible.) 
For other expenses, such as insurance and utilities, you are allowed to 
deduct the portion of the total equal to the investment usage. In the case of 
utilities, you may also deduct the bills for the specific months that the 
property is rented out. Depreciation—which is an allowance each year—is 
deducted on a percentage basis. For example, if the property is used 75 
percent of the year as a rental, you first calculate the full-year depreciation 
and then deduct the applicable percentage. 
Mix of Residential and Rental Use 
The division of expenses between personal use and investment use is 
especially complex when you use a single property in both ways at the same 
time. If you rent out part of your home, you can deduct a portion of all 
expenses of the household—property taxes, interest, insurance, utilities, 
repairs and maintenance, and landscaping, for example. Taxes and interest 
(the personal portion) are included as itemized deductions, while the rental 
portion of all other expenses is included as investment expense. 
If you have a separate building on your property, often called an additional 
dwelling unit (ADU), the calculation of expenses can be quite simple. If the 
unit has separate utility meters, for example, division of utilities is clear. If 

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 130 ]
you know the cost of constructing a separate unit, you also have an exact 
figure for the improvement, which serves as the basis for depreciation. It is 
more likely, however, that you will not have separate utility meters or a 
precise figure for the cost of the rental unit. If you cannot easily separate the 
ADU’s value from the main house, you must divide the basis using another 
method. The same guideline applies when you rent out part of your house. 
For example, a section of your house may have its own entrance and contain 
its own kitchen and bathroom. Even though it is in the same building, it is 
completely separate from your residential area. 
Calculating Percentage of Square Footage. The most reliable method in this 
situation involves calculating square footage. The rental area, as a fraction 
of total square footage, is converted to a percentage of the total, and that 
percentage indicates the portion of expenses that can be deducted as 
investment expenses. 
EXAMPLE: If your total area is 3,000 square feet, and 900 square feet is 
the size of the rental area, you can deduct 30 percent of total household 
expenses. The division is complicated if you rent out the area for only 
part of the year. If your house is 3,000 square feet, and you rent out 
900 square feet, but only for nine months, you have to reduce the 
allowable portion to three-quarters (nine out of twelve months) as follows: 
(a) $900 ÷ $3,000 = 30% 
(b) 9/12 of the year x 30% = 22.5% 
Figuring Depreciation. When you claim depreciation for a rental area, you 
have to apply the same percentages. For example, if you originally bought 
your house for $180,000 and the land is worth $40,000, then $140,000 is 
subject to depreciation (you are not allowed to depreciate land). Based on a 
period of 27.5 years (the depreciation period for residential real estate), you 
would calculate depreciation using the same percentages from the previous 
example, as follows: 
(a) $140,000 ÷ 27.5 years = $5,091 (full-year depreciation allowance) 
(b) $5,091 × 30% = $1,527 (applied to rental area) 
(c) $1,527 × 9/12 = $1,145 (part-year depreciation allowance) 
So there are several qualifying restrictions when claiming depreciation in 
these circumstances. Land cannot be included, you reduce the full-year 

KeePing tracK of real estate transactions 
[ 131 ]
depreciation to reflect only the portion of the home (30 percent in this example) 
that is rented out, and you further reduce the dollar value when the rental 
occurs for only a portion of the full year (here 9/12, or 75 percent, of the year). 
iMPortant In calculating depreciation, you have to base the amount 
you claim on the original basis in the property. If you bought your home 
many years ago for $85,000 ($50,000 for the building and $35,000 for 
the land), you have to base your depreciation on the $50,000 value—
even if your property is worth much more in today’s market. 
TRACKING SPLIT EXPENSES  
THROUGH YOUR SYSTEM 
Great care is required to keep track of any expenses that you split. Keep 
good records of the assumptions you use when splitting expenses between 
personal and investment use. A simple worksheet can be used to make your 
calculations, and this worksheet should be included with your permanent 
tax records for each year. 
do tHe breaKdoWn rigHt aWaY Make the adjustments at the 
time that you enter the expenses into your records. If you are dividing a 
utility bill between personal and investment use, for example, calculate 
the breakdown when you make the payment. The least desirable method 
is to go back at the end of the year and calculate all of the divisions of 
expenses; it makes more sense to do the split as you make each payment.
How to Enter Split Expenses 
Recalling the advice that you keep a separate checking account for investment 
activity, how do you make an entry for expenses that are partially investment 
and partially personal in nature? Since you want to be able to completely 
document and track all expenses that you claim as deductions, you have four 
choices:
1. Pay the full bill from your personal account and make a “memo” entry in your 
investment payments record. One simple method is to pay the bill from 
your personal account and, at the same time, record the investment 

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 132 ]
portion in your rental activity books. Cross-reference the personal check 
number so that it can be traced back easily to the actual payment. While 
this method simplifies the transaction, it requires two steps. The key is to 
remember to record the investment portion. In an effective bookkeeping 
system, the majority of entries are tied to a cash transaction, a deposit, 
or a check. In this example, you need to enter an expense by making a 
memo entry, a transaction that is not tied to a cash transaction. The idea 
works as long as you remember to make the entry; it fails if you overlook 
that extra step. 
2. Pay the full bill from your investment account and exclude a portion. As an 
alternative, you could pay the entire expense from your investment 
account and record the personal portion as a nondeductible expense. 
There are a couple of problems with this method. First, it violates the 
general guideline of keeping personal and investment expenses separate. 
Second, it requires you to deposit extra cash into your investment account 
to cover your mortgage payment, property taxes, insurance, and other 
expenses. To track cash flow, it is more desirable to keep the investment 
account strictly dedicated to investment activity, with as few exceptions 
as possible. 
3. Pay the investment portion from the investment account. Another idea is to 
pay nondeductible expenses from your personal account and to pay 
investment expenses from your investment account. You can either 
transfer funds to your personal account and write a single check, which 
may be the most practical method, or you can write two checks each 
month, one for the personal portion and the other for the investment 
portion. This keeps the division clean and relatively simple but requires 
additional work, not to mention writing more than one check for each 
payment of utilities, insurance, and your mortgage. 
4. Pay the investment portion from your business account to yourself. Write a 
check to record the investment expense, and deposit that into your 
personal account. This is cumbersome, but it solves the problem of 
keeping each side separate.
Using a worksheet to keep track of mixed-use expenses is an essential part 
of your documentation. A sample worksheet is shown in Figure 6-2.

DOCUMENTATION GUIDELINES 
Each and every transaction (with few exceptions) needs to be documented 
by way of receipt, invoice, statement, voucher, letter, contract, or other 
means. In addition to being able to document all transactions, the properly 
maintained set of books needs to have an audit trail. That means it has to be 
possible for anyone to track everything through your records, from original 
document down to the final entry and, ultimately, onto your tax return. 
How do you document all of your transactions, without getting into a 
time-consuming and space-consuming paper war? You need to keep your 
paperwork, of course. But you also need to be able to control it. You will 
find that as a real estate investor, you need to keep at least as much paperwork 
as is required by any other business, if not more. You need to keep property 
tax statements, tax notifications from mortgage companies, monthly 
statements for utilities, and invoices or statements for insurance, repairs, 
office supplies, and any other expenses you claim on your income tax return. 
You may also need to keep detailed logs for use of a personal automobile 
or truck and for investment-related use of your telephone. The combination 
of invoices or receipts and specialized logs satisfies the need for 
documentation. If you spend a lot of cash, you can estimate the amount of 
deductible expenses; however, it is preferable to keep the receipts and record 
the expenses in your books. The estimate may be reasonable, but you are far 
more likely to miss expenses to which you are entitled when you do not keep 
all of your receipts. 
WHat to do Store your original statements, invoices, and other 
receipts in a folder dedicated to each year. Unless you have an 
exceptionally high volume of transactions, you should be able to keep 
expense documents for one full year in a single folder. Remember the 
general guideline: You should have a receipt for every expense you claim. 
Leaving a Trail 
In addition to keeping all of your receipts, make it easy for anyone to track 
payments through your checking account. The easiest way is to mark your 
check stubs, which provides you with a double benefit. First, it explains how 
the payment is broken down among two or more rental properties. Second, 
it helps you to properly distribute a payment among those properties when 
you make the entry into your bookkeeping system. For example, if you pay 

KeePing tracK of real estate transactions 
[ 135 ]
your property tax bill for three separate properties, break down the payment, 
identifying each portion by property address. Use the same system when 
paying insurance, utilities, and other expenses to a single source when more 
than one property is involved. 
When You Have No Receipt 
What do you do when you make a payment but have no receipt? For example, 
let’s say you spend $75 on hardware for a repair you’re taking care of at your 
rental property, but the receipt gets lost or thrown away. In that case, write 
out a record of the payment. Write down the date, the store, the approximate 
or exact amount of cash you spent, the merchandise you bought, and the 
property address. Put this paper in your system as a replacement for the lost 
receipt. 
Charging Your Purchases 
If you are spending a lot of money in this way and you keep losing your 
receipts, one possible solution is to use a credit card solely for rental-related 
expenses. When you charge your purchases, you get an automatic receipt at 
the point of purchase, and you also get a monthly statement from your credit 
card company. It is desirable to keep the receipt, if only to ensure that you 
don’t get charged any purchases in error, but if you do lose a few receipts, your 
record of purchases shows up on each month’s credit card bill. You can achieve 
the same convenience using a debit card for your investment checking account, 
but in that case, you also have to remember to write down the purchases you 
make in your checking account register. If you are prone to lose receipts, you 
are also likely to forget to write down your debit card purchases. 
The Value of Consistency 
Most systems succeed because the system itself and all of its facets are 
consistent. The methods employed are the same throughout, so anyone 
looking at the books and records can easily find what they need. The 
uniformity of the system is the key to efficiency. 
If a system has a series of unrelated methods, or if you do things differently 
each time you record transactions, it becomes impossible to track the 
movement of money. Once you decide to do things a certain way, stay with 
it. If your practice is to pay all water bills with a single check and then break 
down the payment by property, do it the same way every month. Or if you 
want to write out separate checks, follow that procedure consistently 
throughout the year. Record items in the same manner and with the same 

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 136 ]
timing so that monthly expenses show up once per month. The alternative—
doubled-up expenses one month and none the next—makes the system 
difficult to follow and understand. 
Writing File Memos 
Some circumstances make it difficult to understand your reasoning later. For 
example, you may enter information a specific way one month and not 
remember what you were thinking the following month. This is especially 
true with real estate, when you allocate expenses among properties, pay bills 
in a particular manner, or assign a payment to a specific property. When you 
make decisions that might not be clear later on, write a file memo, a reminder 
to yourself about what your reasoning was when you made the decision. 
The file memo can save a lot of time and trouble later. It can become an 
important part of your record-keeping system and can aid in clarifying what 
would otherwise be a confusing or complicated transaction. 
HOW LONG SHOULD YOU KEEP YOUR RECORDS? 
You have to contend with a number of special accounting problems whenever 
you own rental real estate. In some respects, operating rental property is 
going to involve more paperwork and more complexity than operating many 
other businesses. However, you’ll be on safe ground if you make sure to keep 
all of your documents in a logical manner—while also minimizing the time 
you spend on bookkeeping chores. 
Another accounting problem is that you probably need to maintain some of 
your records for a longer time period than for most types of business. As a 
general guideline, you should keep records of all deductions you claim for at 
least three years from the due date of your tax return. For example, your 2017 
tax return was due on April 15, 2018. So you should plan to hold onto all of 
your documentation until April 15, 2021, three years later. If you file for an 
extension of time to file your tax return, that also extends the retention deadline. 
For example, if you defer your filing date until August 15, 2018, you need to 
keep your records until August 15, 2021, three years from the filing deadline. 
eXcePtion You need to maintain your records of the property cost 
and any subsequent improvements until at least three years from the 
filing deadline for the year in which you sell the property. This means that 
if you hold onto a rental property for twenty years, you also have to keep 

KeePing tracK of real estate transactions 
[ 137 ]
records of your purchase and any capital improvements throughout the 
entire period. This is because you will be claiming depreciation throughout 
the entire period, based on your original basis (usually the amount you 
spend) in the asset. If you will be reporting a capital gain or loss upon 
sale of the property, you must be able to document your original basis. 
Tax-Deferred Exchanges 
The record-keeping requirement can extend even further back than your 
purchase. If you acquire rental property through a tax-deferred exchange (see 
Chapter 9), you also must keep the records for the property you owned before, 
just to be able to show how you arrived at your basis in the new property. 
EXAMPLE: You bought your first rental property for $100,000 several years 
ago and held it for five years. During that time, you may have claimed 
$14,500 in depreciation. When you sold the property last year, you 
received $130,000. Rather than being taxed on your profit, you deferred 
that profit in a tax-free exchange—selling one piece of real estate and 
replacing it with another of equal or greater value. You may have bought 
a new rental property for $145,000, for example. In this case, your basis 
in the new property is not $145,000; it is your purchase price minus any 
deferred gain on the previous property. See Tables 6-1 and 6-2.

[ 138 ]
KeY Point The purpose in explaining all of this is to demonstrate why 
you may need to keep your records of rental real estate for many years 
beyond the basic three-year requirement. To document a tax-free 
exchange, you may need to track basis and adjustments back for many 
years. 
Many special rules and requirements apply to real estate investments that 
are not experienced elsewhere. The requirements for figuring depreciation, 
adjusting rental property basis, and even keeping expenses separate between 
rental and nonrental use (or part-year use of property as a rental) all demand 
special documentation and tracking. Your bookkeeping and record-keeping 
systems have to accommodate these special demands. If you understand the 
transactions and the need for such records, it will not be difficult to set up 
your books to meet all of these requirements. The next chapter goes to the 
next step: setting up your books so that you can handle all of the special 
transactions as efficiently as possible. 

[ 139 ]
7.
CREATING A TIMELY  
AND EFFICIENT  
ACCOUNTING SYSTEM 
R
esolving the special problems concerning your bookkeeping requirements 
is an essential first step in developing an efficient system. As demonstrated 
in Chapter 5, these problems include allocating expenses to specific 
properties; managing expenses that are partially investment related and 
partially personal in nature; breaking down expenses, based on the use of a 
property as a rental for part of the year; and allocating expenses in a property 
that has both personal and investment use. 
Once you have resolved these problems and identified the most efficient 
method for dividing up expenses and documenting how that is done, you 
next need to formalize your bookkeeping so that entries can be made in a 
timely and efficient manner. It is essential to keep your books current; at the 
same time, you want to spend as little time as possible to maintain your 
records, while creating an efficient and complete system.
SETTING UP YOUR ACCOUNTS 
Every bookkeeping system consists of a series of accounts—records for each 
specific type of transaction. In your real estate bookkeeping system, you 
must keep track of several different types of accounts: 
 
 Assets. By definition, assets are the value of property you own, including 
cash, property improvements, and land (adjusted for depreciation), as well 
as equipment used in your investment activity. 

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 140 ]
 
 Liabilities. The most obvious and important liability is going to be the 
mortgage balance you owe on one or more investment properties. This 
liability is reduced each month as you make payments. There are current 
liabilities (the sum of payments due over the next twelve months) and 
long-term liabilities (the balance owed on each mortgage). 
 
 Income. The rents you receive from tenants have to be tracked by property. 
 
 Expenses. These accounts are used to record your deductible investment 
expenses. You need to track expenses both by category and by property. 
The Difference between Assets and Liabilities 
The difference between assets and liabilities represents your equity in 
properties. For example, if you buy a $125,000 property with $29,000 down 
and you finance $96,000, your equity is $29,000—the difference between 
the asset value and the liability. 
In the initial transaction of purchasing a rental property, you must make 
a series of entries in your books. If you finance your $96,000 loan, your 
current liability will be the principal portion due over the next twelve 
months (which changes each year). This can be estimated and updated 
periodically; absolute accuracy will become important only when you 
present a summary of assets and liabilities to a lender. You also need to 
break out the value of land separately because you are allowed to depreciate 
improvements but not the land itself. (See Chapter 8 for an explanation of 
how to determine land and improvement values.) For the purpose of the 
initial entry, let’s assume that land is worth $40,000 and improvements are 
worth $85,000. 
WHat to record In this situation, you need to record (a) the asset, 
broken down between land and depreciable improvements, and (b) the 
liability, broken down between current (what you owe over the next twelve 
months) and long-term liability. 
The entry for the initial transaction would involve setting up account values 
for all of the components of the purchase: cash paid out, asset accounts, and 
liability accounts. In the double-entry system, the entry looks like the 
summary in Table 7-1.

In this example, the cash down payment is equal to your equity in the 
property. The sum of land and improvements minus the sum of the mortgage 
liabilities (current and long-term) equals $29,000, or your equity in the 
property. 
Why Equity Declines Each Year 
The equity as recorded in your books will decline each year as depreciation 
is recorded. The depreciation expense is offset by a reduction in the 
“improvements” asset. So depreciation accumulates over the period that you 
own the property, and the equity your books show in the property declines. 
This is one of the ironies of accounting. In real terms, your property is 
probably growing in value over the years, but the accounting rules show it 
falling. The reporting of assets, liabilities, and equity is unrealistic because 
it does not show the real current value. It shows the depreciated value of the 
asset, which is a basis for calculating tax liabilities, but it does not reflect the 
true value of your investment. 
Tracking Assets and Liabilities 
The formal recording of assets and liabilities is only required as part of a 
double-entry bookkeeping system. However, even if you do not use such a 
system, you still need to keep track of asset and liability values. For example, 
if you were to apply for financing on another property, the lender would 
want to know your liability as well as an estimate of the market value of 
properties. In an informal bookkeeping system, you need to track rental 

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 142 ]
income and expenses paid, as well as asset values and liabilities. That can be 
done on a card system or simply by recording the breakdowns (between land 
and improvements, as well as between current and long-term mortgage 
liabilities). Then annual depreciation is figured out on a predetermined 
schedule, and the book value of the asset is recorded on the depreciation 
worksheet. So there are simplified and uniform ways to track these items 
without using double-entry bookkeeping. 
Recording Expenses 
A simple way to record expenses is by using a single-entry method. You 
track receipts and payments through your checkbook and calculate 
adjustments for interest and principal at the end of each month, or only a 
few times per year. A single-entry bookkeeping system is usually enough to 
track day-to-day expenses, and if you need to formalize your system beyond 
that, the adjustments can be done separately. If you use an online accounting 
and bookkeeping system, you do not even need to be concerned with which 
system you use; you simply enter information into the accounts, and the 
program does the rest for you. 
Your Investment Balance Sheet 
Your accounts are divided into two primary areas. The balance sheet 
accounts include assets you own, liabilities you own, and net worth (the 
difference between assets and liabilities). The income accounts include rents 
received and expenses paid. When you subtract expenses from rents, you end 
up with a profit or loss. 
The assets, liabilities, and equity accounts represent your investment 
balance sheet. If you were to include information about your real estate 
investments on a loan application, you would report the balance sheet items 
in addition to showing activity in your rentals in terms of income, expense, 
and net profit or loss. These accounts are collectively referred to as “profit 
and loss” or, on a loan application, as an “income statement.” 
You report rental income, expenses, and profit or loss in a specific 
sequence on your tax return; you also break down this information by 
property. Thus, your books have to include not only the breakdown by 
category but also a series of subaccounts for each property. If you maintain 
your books manually, you are likely to maintain subaccounts on one side of 
each account page, with a summary on the other. Figure 7-1 shows how this 
type of account appears. The debits and credits refer to the summary of all 
transactions, and the subaccounts break these down by property.

Figure 7-2 shows a typical form of account with both subaccount breakdowns

subaccounts. In this example, rental income is reported for four different 
properties. Because income is a credit-balance account, the accumulated 
rents are shown as a growing credit balance through the year. 
Why are rents reported as credits? Many people who have not been 
trained in bookkeeping find such rules confusing. Expenses are reported 
without parentheses, and income is reported with parentheses. The 
designation of rental income as a credit does not mean there is a loss, only 
that the values are reported in credit-balance accounts. This makes sense 
when you trace a transaction. When you receive rent, it increases your cash 
balance (a debit) and, at the same time, increases your rental income (a 
credit). The cash account reports additions as debits or plus accounts and 
payments as credits or deductions. A bookkeeper treats these debits and 
credits in a manner that keeps both sides the same. So every plus (debit) has 
a corresponding minus (credit) entry. The accumulation of income is 
accounted for on the credit side while expenses show up as charges on the 
debit side. Therefore, a typical rental-receipt entry would involve a debit to 
cash and a credit to rent income, as in Table 7-2.

Single-Entry Bookkeeping 
Fortunately, you do not need to become an expert in bookkeeping and 
accounting to keep a simple set of books for your rental activity. However, 
it helps to understand some of the basic concepts. If you maintain your 
books on an automated system or spreadsheet, you can simply enter the 
information in the preset formats. If you keep books by hand, it helps to 
have a formalized entry system. Double-entry bookkeeping helps avoid 
errors, but it is not essential. In a single-entry system, you record all cash 
transactions in a single ledger, showing additions as plus values and payments 
as minus values. So a single-entry system operates just like your checkbook. 
The single-entry record can be summarized at the end of each month by 
tallying the totals for each account. Remember to keep track of all income 
and expenses by property as well. 

creating a tiMelY and efficient accounting sYsteM 
[ 145 ]
In a typical single-entry system, a series of entries also tracks what is taking 
place in your checking account. If you maintain your checking account with 
adequate detail, you can use it as your primary bookkeeping source, without 
needing to duplicate information elsewhere. The entries in a single-entry 
bookkeeping journal would look like the example in Table 7-3. 
This example can be set up in your checking account record. Because you 
need to track the type of transaction as well as identify each by property 
address, it makes sense to use the journal-format checking account, in which 
checks come three to a page and the running totals are maintained on a 
ledger sheet.

KeY Point Whether you use the simplified single-entry system or a 
more elaborate version of double-entry bookkeeping, the goal is to 
capture all of the information you need as entries occur. Make your 
bookkeeping as easy as possible, make sure it is complete, and to the 
extent it is practical, keep the activity separate from your personal 
records.

BREAKING DOWN LOAN PAYMENTS  
IN YOUR BOOKS 
Each month’s mortgage payment presents special problems for you if your 
lender does not show how much goes to interest and principal. Most lenders 
do not provide you with a monthly breakdown, so you need to estimate the 
totals yourself. 
Chapter 5 explained how a typical year’s payments would be broken 
down between interest and principal. Recalling the formula, the breakdown 
involves the following five steps: 
1. Multiply the balance forward by the annual interest rate. 
2. Divide the result in the previous step by 12 to arrive at this 
month’s interest. 
3. Subtract the interest from the total payment you are making. 
4. Subtract any impounds that you are required to pay from the total 
payment. 
5. The result (total payment less interest and impounds) is this 
month’s principal. 
Subtract this amount from the previous balance to arrive at the new balance 
forward. 
You may need to apply this formula to each payment on a monthly basis in 
order to properly break down the various items. This is important because it 
enables you to track not only your profit and loss but cash flow as well. These 
are not the same. Interest payments and impounds affect your profits; however, 
the entire payment—including principal—affects overall cash flow. In real 
estate investments, cash flow may be more critical than actual profits. Because 
most people buy real estate for the long term, future profits may be expected 
and year-to-year profits may not be as important. For purposes of tax 
calculations, month-to-month profits do not reflect depreciation expenses, 
and depreciation itself is a noncash expense. So profitability has to be 
distinguished in two different ways: immediate profits and long-term profits. 
Immediate Profits 
Immediate profits refer to the monthly and annual reported profits. This 
number affects your federal tax liability. For example, you may have an 
after-tax positive cash flow while still reporting a net loss for tax purposes. 
This occurs because depreciation is calculated as an expense, although it does 
not involve a cash outlay. The tax benefits of investing in real estate are one of 

creating a tiMelY and efficient accounting sYsteM 
[ 147 ]
many features that make it a desirable investment; however, most people are 
going to be far more concerned with net cash flow from month to month. 
To demonstrate how you can have the combination of positive cash flow 
and a tax loss, consider this example: Your rental income is $6,800 for the 
year, and cash expenses come up to a total of $5,700 (interest on your 
mortgage, utilities, property taxes, and insurance). Depreciation is calculated 
as a deductible expense, but you don’t pay out cash. In this example, if 
depreciation is $2,000 per year, you will show a net loss of $900, which is 
calculated in Table 7-4.
TABLE 7-4. CALCULATED NET LOSS
Rent receipts
 6,800.00
Less: Cash expenses
−5,700.00
Positive cash flow
 1,100.00
Less: Depreciation
−2,000.00
Net loss
− 900.00
This calculation has to be adjusted to allow for the principal portion of your 
mortgage payment. Although this is not a deductible expense, it is money 
being paid out, so it affects cash flow. For example, if this year’s principal 
payment came to $600, you would report positive cash flow of $500 ($1,100 
predepreciation profit minus $600 for principal payments). The net loss of 
$900 remains unaffected. 
KeY Point In this example, the difference between cash flow and 
tax-reported loss is significant. It makes our point that you can achieve 
both, and, in fact, that is not uncommon. Depreciation is a major expense, 
and it has “tax savings value” in the sense that the expense reduces your 
taxes. A $2,000 annual depreciation for someone in the federal 39.6 
percent tax bracket plus 4 percent state tax (total 43.6 percent) translates 
to a tax reduction of $872 per year (43.6 percent of $2,000). 
Long-Term Profits 
Long-term profits from real estate investments refer to the difference between 
your net purchase and net sales prices on each investment. As long as 

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 148 ]
property values rise, you will want to continue holding onto properties. This 
assumes that (a) you are able to create a breakeven or positive cash flow each 
month and (b) you are willing to continue working with tenants. You are 
able to defer taxes on profits from real estate investments by selling property 
and exchanging it for later purchases of equal or greater net value, subject 
to some limitations (see Chapter 9). You may also avoid taxes by later 
converting a rental property to your primary residence. As long as you use 
the property as your primary residence for at least twenty-four months 
during the five years preceding the sale, profits will be free of tax. The ex-
ception: You have to pay taxes on profits equal to the amount of depreciation 
that was claimed during the period you used the property as a rental, which 
is called the recapture of depreciation. 
ACCOUNTING FOR PREPAID INSURANCE  
AND TAXES 
Impounds for property taxes and insurance may be added onto your 
payments. As a general rule, these expenses are payable twice a year; your 
lender collects the impound each month and then makes timely payments on 
your behalf. 
If impounds are included in your monthly payment, it is not necessarily 
accurate to just assign those deductions to the taxes and interest expense 
accounts for each property. The applicable period may be different from the 
timing of impounds. 
EXAMPLE: Your lender begins taking impounds when your loan is originated 
in September. However, property taxes are not payable until the 
following April for the first half of the calendar year. 
Timing Differences 
In this example, there are two timing differences. First, the impounds are 
withheld beginning in September, although the taxes relate to the following 
year. Second, the payment is not due until the following April, even though 
the expense applies from January onward. While this is a confusing 
problem, it is not difficult to manage in your books. Table 7-5 breaks down 
the timing differences for you, based on the example of a $1,200 annual 
property tax bill.

In this situation—where you have two separate timing problems to track—
the easiest solution is to treat impounds as prepayments and to report the 
actual liability in the correct month. So, as each impound is withheld, the 
bookkeeping entry is shown in Table 7-6.

Getting the Timing Right 
This series of entries places the correct expense of $100.00 per month at the 
right time. The impound account has a perpetual balance of $400.00 
because the original series of entries in this example began four months 
before the end of the year. Mortgage lenders invariably try to collect 
impounds in advance of the payment due dates. If you begin your mortgage 
term midway through a payment term such as this, part of your closing costs 
will include the liability for either taxes or insurance. 
The point in making these adjustments is to make sure that the expense 
ends up in the correct month. The example of property taxes makes this 
point; the liability applies equally throughout the year. Impounds do not 
necessarily correspond to the applicable month. Even if you pay property 
taxes or insurance directly, some adjustment needs to be made. 
For example, you would reflect a debit to the expense each month 
throughout the year and offset that with payments, as shown in Table 7-9.

Making Special Adjustments for Profit and Loss 
In this case, the expense occurs and applies to each month in advance of the 
payment date of the taxes that are due in April and October. Thus, the 

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 152 ]
payments represent an effect on cash flow in those two months. However, to 
accurately report the profit or loss on real estate activity, you need to show 
one-twelfth of the total expense each month. A similar situation arises when 
dealing with insurance. The premium is probably due twice a year or quarterly, 
but the expense for each property should be shown each month as well. 
iMPortant Timing differences can distort both profit and cash flow 
if not properly adjusted in your system. You need to track cash flow by 
property and in total so that you can know throughout the year what your 
actual after-tax net profit is, as compared to your original estimates. To 
compute the after-tax number, you need to include monthly taxes and 
insurance, even if you have not paid those bills yet. 
Adjusting the Books Monthly 
Real estate investors who are not well versed in accounting have to struggle 
with problems such as this unless they can come up with a simple and 
consistent method for adjusting the books. Reflecting each expense in the 
proper month helps make monthly and year-to-date profit analysis possible 
with accuracy. For most people, the problem involves knowing how to make 
the adjustments. If you want to keep your books simple but still make the 
adjustments, and if you know the monthly liability for periodically paid or 
impounded expenses, you can perform the adjustments on a worksheet as 
follows: 
1. Write down a summary of income received and expenses paid for 
the month. 
2. Calculate the estimated adjustments for property taxes and 
interest expenses. 
3. Make an additional adjustment for the allowable depreciation, 
based on the annual allowance (see Chapter 8). Apply one-twelfth 
of the annual depreciation to each month’s profit number to get 
the true profit or loss. 
4. If the results show a loss after adjusting for property taxes, 
interest, and depreciation, subtract the tax savings to arrive at the 
after-tax profit or loss. 
5. To calculate federal tax savings, divide your total income tax by 
the taxable income on your latest year’s tax return. The resulting 
percentage is your effective tax rate. Multiply your net loss by this 
rate to arrive at the tax savings. 

creating a tiMelY and efficient accounting sYsteM 
[ 153 ]
A worksheet for calculating after-tax net loss for both the current month 
and year-to-date totals is shown in Figure 7-3.

State Taxes, too. You may also need to adjust the effective tax rate to account 
for state taxes that you pay. As long as you receive a tax benefit from state 
taxes, that should be a part of the calculation. When your allowable 
deductions are figured differently for state tax purposes, the calculation may 
be more complicated. Since the purpose is to show the savings, simply 
recalculate what your tax liability would have been if real estate investment 
losses had been included. The combined federal and state tax liability is the 
amount to include on the worksheet. 
DOCUMENTING SPECIAL RENTAL SITUATIONS 
You are going to need additional documentation in three situations: mixed 
use of property, allocations between properties, and cash expenses. 

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 154 ]
Mixed Use of Property
When a specific property is a rental for only part of the year, or if you rent 
out part of the home you use as your primary residence, you must divide 
expenses between the two types of use. For taxes and interest, the personal 
portion is reported on Schedule A (Itemized Deductions) and the investment 
portion is shown on Schedule E as an investment expense. The calculation 
between personal and investment use is worth making if your itemized 
deductions are marginal. For example, reporting a portion of your taxes and 
interest as rental expense could reduce itemized deductions enough so that 
you reduce your taxes more by claiming the standard deduction. 
KeY Point You might discover that you are better off claiming the 
standard deduction rather than itemizing. This will be true if your itemized 
deductions add up to a dollar value that is lower than the standard 
deduction. 
For all other expenses—utilities, insurance, and repairs, for example— 
you are not allowed to claim any personal expenses. However, the portion 
that applies to rental use is deductible as an investment expense. For example, 
if you use a property 25 percent as an investment and 75 percent for personal 
use, your expenses would be broken down as shown in Table 7-10.

In this example, the personal portion assigned as itemized deductions is 
only $6,278. This is less than the allowable standard deduction if your filing 
status is married filing jointly or head of household. So you would pay less 
tax by claiming a standard deduction unless you are able to claim additional 
itemized deductions. Whichever way this comes out, keep your calculations 
in order to justify how you break out the expense. 

creating a tiMelY and efficient accounting sYsteM 
[ 155 ]
Breaking Down Personal vs. Investment Use: Part of your worksheet should 
be the precise calculation between personal and investment use of the 
property. If the entire property was used as a rental but for only a portion 
of the year, the calculation should be based on the number of days or months. 
For example, if you lived in the house from January 1 through September 30 
and then rented it out from October 1 through December 31, the rental 
period was 25 percent (three months out of twelve). If you permanently rent 
out part of your property, the breakdown should be based on the square 
footage of rental space as a portion of total square footage. For example, if 
your total living space is 3,000 square feet and you rent out 750 feet, then 
the rental portion is 25 percent. 
Allocations between Properties 
Some expenses are properly allocated to a specific property. In the case of 
utilities, insurance, property taxes, and interest, it is easy to make this 
allocation. In the case of expenses that are not specific to a single property 
(e.g., legal or accounting fees, office supplies, or telephone), you can allocate 
a portion to each property or show nonallocated expenses as a separate 
category on your tax return. 
KeY Point If you decide to allocate expenses to each property, the 
most reliable method is to divide nonallocated expenses on the same 
percentage as total rents you collected. For example, if your total rents 
for the year were $22,600 and one property’s rents were $7,232, its 
share of the total would be 32 percent. 
Accounting for Cash Expenses 
The easiest way to get cash expenses into your system is to reimburse yourself 
based on receipts you save up. Simply write a check to yourself showing the 
breakdown by type of expense and for each property. If you have lost 
receipts, write a memo receipt noting the date, amount, property, and 
amount you spent. Try to avoid excessive expenses without proper receipts. 
The more documentation you keep, the better your bookkeeping system.

MAKING YOUR ACCOUNTING SYSTEM WORK 
Even if you have to make a lot of cash transactions, you can ensure that your 
system captures all of your legitimate deductions, that every transaction can 
be proved and traced through your system, and that it does not become too 
time-consuming. Here are some guidelines for making your system work: 
 
Consider the practical over system requirements. No system is going to work 
for every possible situation. You may simply need to use cash a lot of the 
time based on the way you work, the kind of expenses you have, and your 
personal preference. So, even if your “rule” is that you do not use cash 
when you can write a check or use a credit card, there are going to be 
times when cash works better for you. This is a practical reality, and you 
can’t be expected to change your style just because the system would be 
more efficient, easier, and more consistent. 
 
Remember to balance time against bureaucracy. If you are spending way too 
much time working on your books, you probably need to streamline 
your procedures. You want to spend as little time as necessary to get the 
best possible system. However, it often is the case that—in the interest of 
making the system thorough—a person who is not experienced in 
bookkeeping may create a system that is overly complex. Efficiency often 
means reducing the paperwork as much as possible. Reevaluate your 
procedures and look for ways to cut back on the time and paperwork 
requirements. 
 
If you need help, ask for it. Don’t let yourself get buried in the bookkeeping 
system. If you are overwhelmed and don’t know how to fix it, ask your 
bookkeeper or accountant to show you a better way. At times, the solution 
is automation. 
 
If you simply don’t enjoy bookkeeping, pay someone else to do it. There is no 
absolute rule that you have to do your own books. You may save money 
by not paying a professional, but that economy is worthwhile only if you 
are not having fun. To paraphrase the popular bumper sticker: “Friends 
don’t let their friends keep their own books.” You might enjoy the task 
and find it easy and fast. Or you may dread it and end up frustrated and 
buried in complexity.

HANDLING DEPRECIATION FOR 
RENTAL PROPERTIES
Y
ou are allowed to deduct expenses each year that pertain to your real 
estate investment activity. By definition, deductible expenses include 
interest, property taxes, utilities, legal and accounting fees, auto expenses, 
and any other items relating to managing and maintaining your property. 
As an investor, you also purchase capital assets and are entitled to deduct 
those costs as well; however, they cannot be deducted in a single year. They 
have to be depreciated over a specified number of years, called a recovery 
period. 
The distinction between expenses and capital assets is an easy one to 
make. An expense, for the most part, relates specifically to the year in which 
money is spent. A utility bill is for services for the current month, and interest 
is calculated on each month’s outstanding mortgage balance. Some 
exceptions do occur. For example, you may have purchased business cards 
that last several years. The amount of such an expense is small, however, so 
it does not need to be treated as a capital asset. 
In comparison to expenses, the cost of capital assets cannot be applied 
to a single year. They have value over many years, and the period is called 
the asset’s useful life. You are allowed to claim depreciation each year on 
a predetermined schedule, to write off a portion of a capital asset over 
several years. 
The rules for depreciation are complex, and many elections, rules, and 
restrictions come into play in the calculation itself. Rely on your tax adviser 
to assist with determining the best depreciation elections to make. 
Remembering that your maximum real estate loss deduction is limited to 
$25,000 maximum per year, there are instances in which it makes sense to 

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 158 ]
claim the least amount of depreciation each year, notably if your losses will 
be close to or over $25,000.
OVERVIEW: HOW DEPRECIATION WORKS 
The depreciation system is designed to allow businesses and investors to 
divide capital assets into specific categories and then to claim depreciation 
as allowed under current federal tax law. The legal definition reads: 
“Depreciation is the annual deduction allowed to recover the cost or other 
basis of business or investment property having a useful life substantially 
beyond the tax year.”1 
Real Estate Depreciation 
Real estate investments cannot be deducted as an expense in the year you 
buy property. However, building improvements (the building itself, as well 
as a new roof and siding, fixtures, additions, and repairs of internal systems) 
are set up as capital assets and depreciated over many years. You also claim 
depreciation for an auto or truck and other equipment needed to manage 
your real estate investments, including computers, office equipment, and 
landscaping equipment. 
Depreciation applies to all capital assets, with one exception. You are not 
allowed to claim depreciation for the value of land. For example, if you buy 
an investment property for $150,000, and the land is worth $40,000, you 
can deduct depreciation on the improvements of $110,000. The value of the 
land portion of your investment property—in this example, $40,000—is 
carried on your books as an asset and cannot be deducted or depreciated. 
Depreciation is always calculated based on your purchase price and never 
on current market value. Let’s say you bought your primary residence fifteen 
years ago and paid $85,000 ($15,000 for land and $70,000 for improvements). 
If you later decide to convert this property to a rental, your depreciation will 
be based on the $70,000 base value of improvements. Even if values have 
increased significantly and the property is now worth $200,000, your 
depreciation has to be based on your purchase price. This is one of the flaws 
in the tax and accounting rules. Current valuation does not matter. Only 
your original cost can be used to set depreciation.
The calculation is based on the recovery period to be used. Residential 
real estate is normally depreciated over 27.5 years using the straight-line 
method (the same amount is depreciated each year). After 27.5 years, the 
property is fully depreciated, and no more depreciation will be allowed. 
Each year’s depreciation is reported as an expense, and this is where real 

Handling dePreciation for rental ProPerties
[ 159 ]
estate investors have an advantage over most other forms of investment. 
Depreciation is a legitimate expense even though you do not have to spend 
money each year. It’s calculated based on what you paid for the property, 
and the expense is deductible on your tax return. This is set up as a journal 
entry and entered into your books. The journal entry is necessary because 
no cash is exchanged. An example based on annual depreciation of $2,550 
is summarized in Table 8-1.
TABLE 8-1. DEPRECIATION JOURNAL ENTRY ($)
Account
Debit
Credit
Depreciation expense
2,550.00
  Accumulated depreciation
2,550.00
Accumulated depreciation is a reduction of the asset. So, as this is entered 
each year, the net asset value declines as the expense is recorded to reduce 
net investment income.
Amortization 
Closely related to depreciation is amortization. You are allowed to amortize 
some assets, such as points paid on mortgage loans or the cost of starting a 
business, and intangible assets.
For most real estate investors, amortization expense will be limited to 
points charged by a lender. The points paid to acquire your mortgage loan 
cannot be deducted in a single year. Instead, those points are amortized over 
the number of years of the loan. For example, if your mortgage loan is set 
up to be repaid over thirty years and you paid $1,500 in points, you are 
required to amortize it at a rate of $50 per year. 
A point is equal to 1 percent of the amount borrowed and there are two 
types. Origination points are assessed to compensate the loan originator, and 
discount points are a form of prepaid interest. For primary residence loans, 
these are fully deductible as itemized deductions, with limitations for higher 
earners. However, for income property, the points have to be set up as assets 
and amortized over the term of the loan. For example, if you borrow $180,000 
and are charged three points, the total is $5,400. You are allowed to amortize 
only a portion each year. For a thirty-year loan, this is $180 per year. The 
journal entry to record this expense is shown in Table 8-2.

Assets Used Only for Investment Purposes 
For all assets you use exclusively for investment purposes, calculating 
depreciation is not complex, especially compared to the calculation for 
property used partly as a residence and partly as a rental. As long as you 
have a solid bookkeeping system and records of the dates you purchased 
assets, you can claim depreciation as a legitimate expense. A distinction 
should be made between when a capital asset is purchased and when it is 
placed in service. You are allowed to depreciate an investment asset from the 
date it is placed in service, meaning the date you began using it as part of 
your investment program. The distinction is further clarified by the IRS: 
“Depreciation starts when you first use the property in your business or for 
the production of income.”2 
EXAMPLE: You planned to begin purchasing investment properties last year, 
and you bought a riding lawn mower to be used exclusively in 
maintaining your properties. However, you did not buy your first 
property until last month. Even though the lawn mower was purchased 
last year, it was not placed in service until you bought your first rental 
property. 
EXAMPLE: You bought a house three months ago as a rental. In your city, 
there is a large university population. You did not rent it out immediately 
because you expected higher demand once the fall semester began. In 
this case, depreciation begins once you begin seeking tenants, not on 
the purchase date.
A

[ 161 ]
Mixed Use of an Asset 
One difficulty in calculating depreciation arises when you use an asset—a 
truck, for example—partly for personal use and partly for investment. In that 
case, you are required to keep records to establish the applicable investment 
use. The depreciation you claim is reduced to the percentage of investment 
use, and you are not allowed to claim depreciation above that level. 
Part-time rental of property or renting out a portion of your house also 
presents special considerations when it comes to depreciation. Calculating 
depreciation on mixed-use property is discussed in more detail later in this 
chapter. 
Establishing an Office at Home 
You may use a portion of your home to conduct business for managing your 
real estate investments. The rules are strict for claiming a depreciation 
deduction in this case. You have to be able to establish that you use a specific 
room 100 percent of the time to conduct business. For example, if you use a 
room as an office, you cannot also use it to store personal items or as a guest 
room. It has to be assigned exclusively to investment activity. The amount of 
depreciation claimed would be a percentage of your home’s total value 
(excluding land). For example, a 300-square-foot room in a 2,500-square-foot 
home is equal to 12 percent of the total. You could claim one-twelfth of the 
allowable annual depreciation, if you were able to establish the exclusive 
investment use of that room.
is it WortH it? Most investors find that even if they can establish 
an exclusive use of one room as an office, the amount of depreciation is 
so small that it is not worthwhile to claim depreciation. For example, if 
your home’s value (excluding land) is $125,000, the total annual 
allowance (based on the 27.5 years you are required to use for 
depreciation) is $4,545 per year, and one-twelfth of that is $379. Tax 
advisers have observed that claiming expenses for a home office may act 
as a red flag and could even trigger an audit. Considering the relatively 
small benefit to this claim, it is of questionable value. In addition, 
because overall net losses on investment activity are limited, you might 
not need this additional deduction. 

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 162 ]
Claiming Depreciation 
To report and claim depreciation, you will need IRS Form 4562 and the 
publication entitled “Instructions for Form 4562.” Detailed explanations for 
filling out forms are included in Chapter 10. 
WHere to looK IRS forms and publications can be downloaded 
online from the Internal Revenue Service’s Web site at https://www.irs.gov. 
In submitting your tax return, you are not required to provide detailed 
information about the assets involved. However, you need to keep permanent 
records in your files of (a) asset purchases and sales, including date and 
amount, (b) methods you use to calculate depreciation each year, and (c) 
calculations for depreciating assets that apply only partially to investment 
activity. 
Because depreciation rules may change from one year to the next, it is 
wise to calculate depreciation at the time you begin claiming it—usually 
when you buy the property—and set up a summary for the entire period 
involved, keeping that calculation as part of your bookkeeping records. This 
also helps you to complete your tax return each year and to adjust for new 
purchases or for the sale of assets during the year. Later in this chapter, 
several tables are provided summarizing the percentages of depreciation 
allowed under specific recovery periods and using various depreciation 
methods. Once you identify the correct method to use, you will be able to 
calculate depreciation for the initial year as well as for all future years for 
each asset.
KEEPING THE LOSS LIMIT IN MIND 
The limitation of the $25,000 maximum annual deduction of real estate 
losses is critical to planning how to depreciate assets. (See Chapter 9 for tax 
rules relating to real estate investing.) 
EXAMPLE 1: Your adjusted gross income (AGI) last year was $85,000. You 
are entitled to claim up to a full $25,000 loss from real estate activities 
qualified under current IRS rules. 

Handling dePreciation for rental ProPerties
[ 163 ]
EXAMPLE 2: Your adjusted gross income last year was $113,000. Your 
maximum deductible loss from real estate is reduced by 50 cents for 
each dollar of income above $100,000. Accordingly, your maximum 
allowable loss deduction is $18,500, summarized in Table 8-3.

The deduction for real estate losses is reduced to zero for adjusted gross 
income of $150,000 or more. The “adjusted gross income” used in the 
previous calculation is actually a modified version of the number reported; 
certain expenses have to be added back in to arrive at the total to be used 
(see Chapter 9). 
Some assets you use in real estate activity can be depreciated using 
accelerated methods, where more depreciation is claimed in the early years 
and less later on. You can elect to use the straight-line method for those 
assets (more about this method later in this chapter). The point is an 
important one: There is no advantage in claiming an accelerated amount of 
depreciation, even when it is allowed under the rules (such as for vehicles, 
computer and office equipment, and landscaping tools), if you will not be 
allowed to claim a loss. If you have a lot of depreciation expense during the 
year, it is of no value if the loss is disallowed. This occurs if your reported 
loss is more than $25,000 or if your modified adjusted gross income is 
higher than $150,000. In these instances—with your deductible losses 
limited anyway—it makes sense to report depreciation over a longer period 
of time and minimize the amount claimed each year. 
CALCULATING LAND VALUES 
The one exception to the general rule that you can depreciate capital assets 
is land. You are not allowed to depreciate land under any circumstances. 

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 164 ]
This raises a question for anyone who purchases investment property: How 
do you calculate the value of land versus the value of improvements? 
Consistency 
You can use any reasonable method to calculate land value. However, once 
you pick a method, it is a good idea to apply it consistently to all properties. 
As long as you can justify your calculation on some logical basis, you will 
be able to claim depreciation for improvements and exclude the value of 
land. You should select a method that you believe is most advantageous to 
you and use it for all properties. Because annual loss deductions are limited, 
“advantageous” could mean using the method with the highest land value. 
However, if your income is below $100,000, and your real estate expenses 
are fairly low, you may want maximum depreciation deductions. In that 
case, select a method that reflects the lowest portion of total value for land. 
Three Commonly Used Methods 
Here are three accepted methods for calculating land value. Notice that each 
one results in a quite different number: 
1. Assessed Value. Your county assesses property for the purpose of 
calculating annual property taxes. Assessed value may approximate 
current market value, or it could be far lower than the realistic levels. 
Calculating land value based on the assessed value is simple; the property 
tax bill sent to you by your county shows the breakdown. 
EXAMPLE 1: You purchased a property this year and paid $137,500. Your 
assessed value, according to your tax bill, is $90,000. This consists of 
$22,000 (24 percent) for land and $68,000 (76 percent) for 
improvements. The division is applied to your purchase price of 
$137,500. You would assign land a value of $33,000 ($137,500 × 
0.24), while improvements, subject to annual depreciation, would be 
valued at $104,500 ($137,500 × 0.76). 
2. Appraised Value. At the time you purchase property, it is appraised for 
financing and also to determine whether the purchase price is reasonable. 
You can use the breakdown in the appraisal report to divide land from 
improvements. 
EXAMPLE

Handling dePreciation for rental ProPerties
[ 165 ]
EXAMPLE 2: You purchased a property for $137,500. The appraisal ordered 
by your lender came in at $140,000 and identified land as being worth 
$45,000 (32 percent) and the replacement value of your home at 
$95,000 (68 percent). Using appraisal value to calculate value, you 
would calculate the value of land as $44,000 ($137,500 × 0.32) and 
the value of depreciable improvements at $93,500 ($137,500 × 0.68). 
3. Insurance Value. You also have values assigned in your real estate insurance 
policy. Most policies include calculations of dwelling protection plus 
“other structures” protection (as well as other values). You can use these 
values as the basis for determining your depreciable base. 
EXAMPLE 3: You purchased a property for $137,500. Based on location, 
age of the home, and features, your insurance company assigns a value 
of $80,000 to the dwelling and an additional $8,000 for the storage 
shed and detached garage. Total depreciable base using this method 
is $88,000, with the remaining $49,500 assigned to the value of land. 
You do not pay insurance for land, since its value would remain even if 
your property were lost in a fire or other damage. 
Determining Which Method to Use 
Each method uses a different base, and any one of them can be justified. The 
appraised value in Example 2 was closest to what was actually paid for the 
property. This will not always be the case, and it will not always be the most 
advantageous method to use. 
If you have only one rental property, low expenses, and income below 
$100,000 per year, you will probably benefit by claiming as much 
depreciation as you are allowed, so a calculation that gives less value to land 
and more to improvements is preferable. However, if you have several 
properties—meaning higher overall reported losses due to more depreciation 
claimed—you will not be able to claim all of the allowed depreciation, and 
part of it will be deferred to later years. If your adjusted gross income is more 
than $100,000, your allowable annual deduction is going to be reduced as 
well, so claiming more depreciation has no benefit. 

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 166 ]
KeY Point Selecting a method to value land is a matter of planning 
ahead. It should be based on your personal income, the number of 
properties you own for investment purposes, and your need for the 
deduction. 
Reporting a Tax Loss 
For the purpose of argument, let’s assume that you will be reporting a tax 
loss on your properties. This is more likely when the depreciable portion of 
your investment property is relatively high. For example, in comparing two 
investments costing $150,000 each, depreciation will be higher when the 
land value is small, and it will decline for a second property whose land 
value is much higher. 
If you own a single property and want the highest possible deduction, you 
will do better (in terms of the deduction and after-tax cash flow) if you select 
properties with a low portion of land value. However, you may also own 
several properties, in which case you cannot use a higher deduction. In that 
case, you may prefer to buy properties whose land value represents a higher 
portion of the total investment value. In such a situation, the property may 
gain higher-than-average market value, especially if the land value is high 
because of its location. So you need to balance the desirability of depreciation 
deductions (or lack of need for those deductions) against the long-term 
investment value of the land itself. 
Depreciation often creates a net loss even in situations where cash flow is 
positive or breakeven. This occurs because the investment is structured so 
that rental income covers payments and expenses, but there is little or 
nothing left over each month. When you then calculate depreciation, it 
creates a net loss. If you are able to write off $5,000 a year in depreciation 
on each property, once you reach five rentals, you have arrived at the 
maximum, so any further deductions will be of no value. Since the annual 
loss deduction applies, no matter how many properties you own, it makes 
sense to plan ahead with the loss ceiling in mind. 
The $25,000 maximum applies to married couples. The law anticipated 
investors filing separately to increase their maximum loss, so the ceiling is 
even lower if you are married and filing separately. As long as you live apart 
from your spouse for the entire year, you are allowed to deduct only $12,500, 
and the deduction begins to phase out at 50 cents per dollar of income above 
$50,000. For example, if you are legally separated and living in an apartment 
by yourself, and your spouse is living in your primary residence for the entire 
year, then the deduction will be allowed—but the maximum loss and income 

Handling dePreciation for rental ProPerties
[ 167 ]
ceilings are cut by one-half, so real estate investors cannot take advantage 
of the rules by proceeding as two single persons, each one claiming a 
$25,000 loss. Thus, if you are married, filing separately but you and your 
spouse did not live apart for the entire year, the loss on real estate investments 
is not available at all. The restriction is intended to discourage tax planning 
that uses marriage to increase deductions or to avoid a reduction in those 
losses during the year. 
HOW TO DEPRECIATE PARTIALLY USED ASSETS 
Many investors employ capital assets that also serve partially as personal 
property. For example, a car or truck, landscaping equipment, or a computer 
system may be used for personal reasons as well as for managing your real 
estate investments. In these situations, you need to keep careful records to 
establish the exact degree of nonpersonal use. Only by being able to 
document how assets are used will you be entitled to claim a depreciation 
deduction. For example: 
 
Automobiles. If you have used your car to monitor properties, meet with 
prospective tenants, collect rents, meet with your accountant, and other 
investment-related purposes, that is considered investment use. Keep a log 
of investment mileage showing the date, purpose of the trip, and total 
mileage. A sample automobile log is available in Chapter 6. 
The investment usage is next divided by total miles. For example, if you 
drove 3,415 miles to manage your real estate investments, and total 
mileage for the year was 22,660, investment usage would be 15 percent 
(3,415 ÷ 22,660). In this example, you would calculate full-year 
depreciation and then claim 15 percent of the total as an investment 
expense. (There are special depreciation limits on cars, trucks, and vans, 
which are explained later in a separate section of this chapter.) 
 
Computers. In the case of computer systems, you would calculate investment 
usage based on an approximation of the amount of time used on 
investment-related matters (record keeping or online housing market 
research, for example). The actual time spent is the standard for this 
calculation, not the time the computer was available for use. 
 
Landscaping Equipment. If you use personal assets such as lawn mowers to 
care for rental properties, you have to calculate a basis for depreciation. 
If you maintain the grounds of two properties, you could probably justify 
deducting two-thirds of the basis as investment expense (the remaining 
one-third would apply to your own residence and thus would be 
nondeductible personal use). 

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 168 ]
 
Property Converted During the Year. For the purpose of calculating depreciation 
on property that was converted to an investment property during the year 
(or an investment property converted to your primary residence), the 
percentage should be based on the number of months it was used for each 
purpose. For example, if the property was a rental for three months and 
your primary residence for nine months, you are entitled to claim 25 
percent of the full-year depreciation as an investment expense. 
 
Renting Out Part of Your Home. If you rent out part of your primary residence, 
the depreciation should be calculated based on a breakdown of square 
footage. For example, if your house contains 2,200 square feet and you 
rent out 600 square feet, 27 percent counts as a rental, and you can claim 
27 percent of the full-year depreciation. This calculation becomes more 
complex when it is a room rental and a tenant also has access to the 
kitchen and common areas of the property. In that situation, you must 
modify the calculation on a basis that makes sense. For example, if the 
common areas (e.g., kitchen, living room, and bathroom) constitute 
approximately 50 percent of the total living space, a portion of that space 
could be deductible if available to a tenant. So, if four people live in the 
house, you could justify claiming an additional deduction for a tenant’s 
access to common areas. Using all of the assumptions in this example, the 
calculation is shown in Table 8-4. 
TABLE 8-4. SQUARE FOOTAGE CALCULATION.

Percentage of total
875 ÷ 2,200 = 40% 
This calculation would allow you to claim 40 percent of the full-year 
depreciation as rental expense. If the rental is available for only part of the 
year, the percentage has to be further reduced to the applicable number of 
months.

[ 169 ]
Fair Calculation of the Asset’s Use 
Any asset used partially for investment purposes should be depreciated 
based on a fair calculation of the portion of use. Each asset has to be 
calculated in its own manner, since the attributes of each (e.g., automobile, 
telephone, computer, and lawn mower) are different. There is no one method, 
so you need to keep good records of how you break down the investment 
portion and how you calculate depreciation for each asset. 
DEPRECIATION LIMITS ON CARS,  
TRUCKS, AND VANS 
The depreciation you claim for passenger automobiles used for investment 
purposes is limited, even if you use the auto exclusively for business. The IRS 
publishes annual limits. For example, passenger automobiles placed in 
service during the year 2016 are subject to the maximum depreciation 
limitations shown in Table 8-5.

Note that these are limits for depreciation that you are allowed to claim if 
the auto is used 100 percent for investment. If you use it only partially for 
investment, you have to reduce the limits accordingly. For example, on the 
basis of your auto log, if your total investment use was 15 percent,  you 
placed the automobile into service in late 2016, and the auto has been in use 
for two years, the maximum allowable would be adjusted not only for the 
partial business use but also because it applied for only part of the year.

depreciation deduction for automobiles, trucks, or vans placed into 
service after 2003, refer to the updated edition of the IRS publication 
“Instructions for Form 4562.”

CLASSIFICATION LIVES AND RECOVERY PERIODS 
All assets are classified in one of several classifications. Some of these 
so-called recovery periods are highly specialized, and others are more 
generalized. The recovery periods that apply to real estate investments are 
summarized in Table 8-6.
TABLE 8-6. RECOVERY PERIODS
Classification
Assets
5-year property
Autos and light trucks; office and computer 
equipment; appliances; carpets; furniture
27.5-year property
Residential real estate
39-year property
Nonresidential real estate
Most capital assets used in your rental activity will fall into the five-year 
classification; your residential real estate investments belong in the 27.5-year 
recovery period. The calculation of depreciation under each recovery period 
is determined by the tax rules. 
Five-Year Recovery Period 
The five-year recovery period depreciation is accelerated in the early years 
and reverts then to straight-line depreciation. The acceleration is at the rate 
of 200 percent. This means that the initial depreciation allowance is twice 
the amount that would be allowed using the straight-line method. (Under 
the straight-line method, the same deduction is allowed each year.) 
Depreciation in the five-year recovery period, using the General Depreciation 
System guidelines, is shown in Table 8-7.

THE HALF-YEAR CONVENTION 
Under the straight-line method, the five-year depreciation term would allow 
20 percent per year. Since the 200 percent accelerated depreciation applies, 
it would seem that the first year’s depreciation should be 40 percent; however, 
it is only 20 percent. The reason for this disparity is that five-year property 
is calculated using what is called the half-year convention. Under this 
convention, all property placed into service during a specific year is treated 
as though it were placed in service at the midpoint of the year. Thus, only 
one-half of the applicable depreciation is allowed in the first year. 
This rule makes it easier to calculate depreciation for all assets in the 
first year of service. Since the rate of depreciation allowed is 200 percent 
of the straight-line rate, the annual depreciation declines. For example, 
under the straight-line rate, you would claim 20 percent per year for five 
years. Using 200 percent declining balance, the first year is 40 percent 
(reduced to 20 percent, due to the half-year convention). Therefore, if the 
asset were worth $1,000, you would depreciate $200 the first year. That 
leaves $800. The second-year calculation would be for 200 percent of a five- 
year rate: 
($800 ÷ 5 years) = $160
Under the 200 percent method, the $160 is doubled, so you would write off 
$320. This is twice the straight-line rate based on the $800, which works 
out to 32 percent of the original $1,000 cost of the asset. Applying this same 
declining calculation to each remaining year’s balance, the depreciation 
declines rapidly in these first years. The rate reverts to the straight-line 
method, according to the depreciation schedule. 
eXcePtion If property placed in service during the last quarter of the 
year is higher than 40 percent of the total of all assets placed in service 
for the year in that same recovery class, the midquarter convention is 
used in place of the midyear convention. For example, you purchased a 
total of $4,000 during the year that is depreciated under the five-year 
recovery period. But $1,700—more than 40 percent—was purchased in 
the fourth quarter. So you would use the midquarter convention. Under 
this method, the percentage of depreciation allowed is changed from 50 
percent (the half-year standard) to 87.75 percent for assets placed in 
service during the first quarter, 62.5 percent for the second quarter, 37.5 
percent for the third quarter, and 12.5 percent for the fourth quarter.

Calculating Depreciation for Real Property 
The rules are different for real property. In calculating first-year depreciation 
for residential or nonresidential real property, the midmonth convention is 
used for calculating depreciation during the first year. The first-year 
percentage varies depending on the month the property is placed in service. 
Residential Property 
For residential property, which is depreciated over 27.5 years under the 
General Depreciation System, you are required to use the straight-line 
method, so the value of real property (purchase price excluding land) is 
calculated by dividing the total by 27.5. But the actual amount of depreciation 
you claim each year depends on the month the property is placed in service. 
Table 8-8 demonstrates that for the first seventeen years, the depreciation 
expense varies and that from the eighteenth year onward, the depreciation 
expense reverts to a uniform percentage. That is 3.637 percent, the equivalent 
annual allowance based on 27.5 years. 
In the application of the midmonth convention, the calculation varies only 
during the first year. In the second year through the ninth year, the annual 
calculation is identical. And the annual deduction increases by only one-half 
of 1 percent per year after that. This is summarized in Table 8-8.

EXAMPLE: You acquired your residential investment property in August this

According to the midmonth convention table, the yearly depreciation from 
years 10 through 28 alternates back and forth between 3.636 percent and 
3.637 percent. In the example given, this will make a difference of only a 
dollar per year. In the interest of simplicity, it is practical to continue 
depreciating $4,545 per year and claim the remaining balance in the twenty- 
ninth year. 
Commercial or Industrial Property 
The schedule for nonresidential real estate is less complicated. The full term 
of thirty-nine years is broken down under the midmonth convention as

For example, if the value of a commercial or industrial investment property 
(excluding land) was calculated at $200,000, and you acquired the property 
in August (the eighth month of the year), your allowable depreciation 
deduction each year would be calculated, using Table 8-10 and the mid-

KeY Point While the special calculations for half-year and midmonth 
conventions complicate these calculations, they apply for the most part 
only to the first year. They help to make the depreciation rules fair and 
consistent. For example, it would not be equitable to allow the same level 
of depreciation for a $200,000 real property acquired in December as 
allowed for one acquired in January, nearly a full year earlier.
KEEPING RECORDS OF DEPRECIATION 
CALCULATIONS 
Keeping track of the depreciation you are allowed to deduct each year is not 
difficult. It makes sense to calculate the depreciation for each year at the 
beginning (when you put the asset in service) and to then maintain the 
schedule so that you do not have to recalculate the deduction each year. 
This suggestion is especially useful for the accelerated five-year recovery 
period, in which the deduction changes each year. You may have a long list 
of assets in this classification. Beyond your computer and automobile, you 
could also have dozens of appliances, for example, each acquired in a 
different year; so keeping track of depreciation allowed for the full term of 
ownership is a sensible idea. 

Handling dePreciation for rental ProPerties
[ 175 ]
EXAMPLE: You have five rental properties. Each one contains a stove, 
refrigerator, and dishwasher. Four also have washers and dryers. 
Altogether, you own twenty-three appliances. If these were acquired in 
different years, calculating depreciation could be complicated. 
SIMPLIFYING THE CALCULATIONS 
Set up a schedule like the one shown in Figure 8-1 to track annual depreciation 
in the five-year recovery period. (You can use the same schedule for your real 
property, but if the calculated deduction is identical in the second year and 
onward, it is not necessary to include them on the schedule.) 
In filling out this schedule, you want to keep track of two separate 
calculations: the annual depreciation and total to date. This is necessary 
because, in reporting depreciation on your tax return, you are required to 
show both prior depreciation and current depreciation. Therefore, allow two 
lines per asset.

EXAMPLE: You acquired a washer/dryer and a refrigerator for Property 1 and 
a refrigerator for Property 2 during the past year. Using the half-year

Reporting Depreciation for Each Asset 
This example provides you with the information needed to report 
depreciation—both current year and prior depreciation—for each asset 
acquired during the year through the entire term that depreciation will 
apply. This type of schedule can be set up using Excel or a similar spreadsheet 
program and extended indefinitely. Subtotals can also be calculated 
automatically and entered for each year, for the cost as well as for current-year 
depreciation and prior depreciation. (In using a spreadsheet program, placing 
current year and prior year subtotals in separate columns makes the 
calculation of subtotals easier.)

Tracking Total Annual Depreciation 
An annual worksheet is also useful for keeping track of each year’s claimed 
depreciation. This worksheet can be used as part of your permanent records, 
or it can be attached to your tax return as a supplementary schedule. The 
worksheet is designed to report all assets, listed and subtotaled by property; 
the date placed in service; cost; prior years’ depreciation; method and 
convention; recovery period; rate or percentage; and the depreciation 
deduction. A worksheet that provides all of this information is shown in 
Figure 8-3. 
FIGURE 8-3. DEPRECIATION WORKSHEET
The information gathered in your permanent records and recorded is easily 
transferred to this worksheet. For example, the details entered in the example 
shown in Figure 8-3 provide all of the information needed to complete the 
depreciation portion of your tax return. 
MAKING DEPRECIATION ELECTIONS 
If you want to calculate depreciation on a different method than the 
prescribed ones, you can make a tax election. There are two elections you 
are likely to use, both of which reduce your depreciation expense in the

earlier years but increase the expense in later years. If you anticipate reaching 
the $25,000 maximum deduction this year and you don’t need the extra 
expense, you may elect to slow down the rate of depreciation. Or, if your 
adjusted gross income exceeds $100,000, it means your real estate investment 
losses are limited, so claiming depreciation does not help. Again, you may 
elect to depreciate under an alternate method. 
A few points to remember about tax elections: 
 
They are usually irrevocable. Once you elect to use a slower depreciation rate, 
you cannot simply revert to the prescribed method. 
 
The election has to be made in the first year. You need to decide how to 
depreciate capital assets during the first year you report the asset as being 
placed into service. 
 
The election usually applies to all assets in the same recovery period. Most 
elections have to be applied to all assets in the recovery class that are 
placed into service during the same year. 
 
The election must be made no later than the due date of your tax return. The 
deadline is the due date for the year the assets were placed in service, 
including extensions of time to file. 
Tax Election #1: 150 Percent Declining Balance 
The calculation of depreciation under the 150 percent schedule is made 
according to the percentages given in Table 8-12. 
EXAMPLE: You acquired five-year property this year worth $4,000. You are 
considering making an irrevocable election to use the 150 percent 
declining-balance method rather than the 200 percent method because 
you believe that you may benefit more from deferring the expense until 
later. Each of these methods would produce the annual depreciation 
expenses summarized in Table 8-12.

Given that the asset value in this example is limited to only $4,000, the 
difference is not significant. However, the higher the dollar amount of assets 
placed into service, the greater the effect of deferring part of the depreciation 
into the later years. 
Tax Election #2: Straight-Line Depreciation 
Another election is to apply straight-line depreciation each year. It is irrevocable 
and has to be applied to all property in the same recovery period and placed 
into service during the year. For example, $4,000 of five-year property would 
be depreciated at the rate of 20 percent per year. Since the half-year convention 
still applies, the first and sixth year would see $400 in depreciation expense, 
and the second through fifth years would have $800 each. 

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 180 ]
iMPortant Depreciation is not difficult to calculate, but the rules are 
revised from time to time. Keeping track of the current rules can be 
difficult, so you need to refer to the instructions any time you acquire new 
assets as part of your real estate investments. 
RECAPTURE OF DEPRECIATION UPON SALE 
When you sell your investment assets, you are required to “recapture” the 
depreciated value. This means that you will be taxed on the amount of 
depreciation that you claimed during the period you owned the property. 
EXAMPLE: You purchased a rental residential property five years ago and 
paid $85,000. The value assigned to the land was $25,000 and the 
value of the improvements to the property was $60,000. Last year, you 
sold the property for $135,000, and you had closing costs of $8,000. 
Your net proceeds were $127,000. 
In this example, your profit on the investment was $42,000 (net sales 
price of $127,000 less purchase price of $85,000). However, your capital 
gain will be adjusted to recapture depreciation. You claimed depreciation 
using the 27.5-year recovery period, which amounted to about $9,800. (This 
figure will vary depending on the month you purchased the property.) The 
calculation of your capital gain would be as shown in Table 8-14.

Keeping Complete Records
Considering the complexities of the depreciation rules—as well as rules for 
calculating net capital gains—many investors require the help of a qualified 
tax preparer. Your task may be limited to documenting all of your 
transactions and maintaining records to ensure that you will be able to 
establish all that you are entitled to claim. A system’s effectiveness can be 
best judged by how easily someone else can figure out what is taking place. 
Your accountant or tax preparer will have an easier job to do if you keep 
good records of purchase dates, dollar amounts, depreciation calculations, 
and all other transactions. 
The importance of thorough records becomes clear when you consider the 
tax rules that cover real estate investing. Depreciation is not the only complex 
topic. The next chapter explains how the rules apply to your investments. 

[ 183 ]

UNDERSTANDING  
THE TAX RULES FOR  
REAL ESTATE
E
veryone who pays taxes knows that the rules seem to change continually 
and that forms, record-keeping requirements, and calculations can all be 
complex. In addition to having to contend with the same tax rules as 
everyone else, real estate investors have to be aware of some rules that apply 
just to them. 
The good news is that most of these special rules are beneficial to real 
estate investors. For example, a sweeping tax reform in 1986 did away with 
the majority of tax shelters. Before that date, investors could deduct losses 
without specific limitations and were able to avoid taxes altogether in some 
instances. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 established new rules. Since that 
date, any loss on a passive investment—one in which other people manage 
your investment property for you or make the day-to-day decisions—can no 
longer be deducted. Such losses have to be carried forward and applied 
against future passive gains. The one exception to this reform was real estate 
investing. Unlike other investors with passive losses, real estate investors can 
deduct passive losses. 
PASSIVE AND ACTIVE INCOME 
By definition, passive activity is an investment that simply provides income 
or loss to you. If you do not “materially participate” in running an operation, 
it is a passive activity. For real estate investors, this distinction is not difficult 
to make. If you invest by buying units in a limited partnership, it is a passive 

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 184 ]
activity. As a limited partner, you do not participate in selecting properties, 
maintaining them, and making decisions from one day to the next. The 
general partners take care of those activities, and limited partners are 
provided passive gain or loss for their investment. 
Active Participation 
If you purchase a house and rent it out, selecting tenants yourself, setting 
rental amounts, performing maintenance work (or hiring someone to do it 
for you), and deciding which properties to buy or sell, then you are actively 
participating in the investment. Even if you hire a manager to run the 
properties, as long as you are involved in tenant selection, maintenance and 
other decisions, you are actively involved in the property. So, even though 
real estate investing (by way of direct ownership of properties) is a passive 
activity, you are allowed to claim a deduction for losses if you materially 
participate in operating the investment properties.
Material Participation 
To qualify for the “material participation” rule, you have to own at least 10 
percent of the property. So if you buy investments with a family member or 
friend, you have to be able to demonstrate that you are at least a 10 percent 
owner and that you materially participated in managing the investments. 
These rules prevent the creation of tax write-offs for individuals who need 
the deductions but do not really take part. For example, a parent whose 
income consists of dividends, interest, and Social Security may not need the 
deductions from investment properties or has excess levels of losses, and a 
son or daughter who is earning a salary but has little or no deductions may 
benefit from a tax loss. In this situation, the ownership and participation 
have to be bona fide to be allowed. A family cannot simply assign a portion 
of ownership to a member who needs the deductions. 
Excess Loss 
Any unused excess loss is carried forward and applied to future years, or, 
when you sell property, the loss is applied against the capital gain. If you 
have several properties, you can apply the entire passive loss carryover to 
offset the gain, even though those losses are not specifically incurred on the 
sold property. If the passive loss carryover exceeds the gain on property, you 
can deduct the entire loss that applies to that property. 

understanding tHe taX rules for real estate 
[ 185 ]
KeY Point Carrying excess losses forward is not beneficial in many 
instances. Deductions from one year to the next are fully deductible up 
to the $25,000 limit. However, if losses are eventually deducted from 
profits and long-term capital gains are realized, you only benefit one-half 
of the dollar value, since the long-term rate is calculated on only 50 
percent of the net gain. 
Adjusted Gross Income 
The definition of adjusted gross income (AGI) has to be modified for this 
calculation. Normally, adjusted gross is all reported income, minus student 
loan interest, IRA investments, moving expenses, one-half of self-employment 
tax, and alimony, for example. In calculating adjusted gross income for 
computation of maximum real estate deductions, you cannot include IRA 
contributions, any taxable Social Security benefits, interest on student loans, 
deductions for one-half of self-employment tax, or tuition and fees 
deductions. In other words, most of the popular adjustments to adjusted 
gross income are disallowed. 
EXAMPLE: Your adjusted gross income last year was $87,500. This included 
deductions for IRA contributions, student loan interest, and tuition 
deduction totaling $22,000. You also had net losses from real estate 
investments of $27,000. If the modified adjusted gross income was 
less than $100,000, you would be allowed to deduct $25,000 in real 
estate investment losses, and the excess of $2,000 would be carried 
over and applied to future years. However, your adjusted gross income 
has to be modified for the $22,000 in adjustments that are disallowed 
as well. This alters your AGI for this purpose to $109,500. Your 
maximum real estate deduction is reduced by one-half of the excess 
over $100,000. The computation is as shown in Table 9-1.

In this example, you would have to carry forward the excess loss of $6,750

deductible losses and carry-forward on Form 8582 (Passive Activity Loss 
Limitations), which becomes a part of your tax return (see Chapter 10). 
RULES FOR THE SALE OF REAL ESTATE 
When investment real estate is sold, the net proceeds are treated as a capital 
gain or loss. The transaction is listed on Form 4797, where depreciable 
property is reported. Calculation of the gain itself and of the taxable portion 
involves adjustments to both purchase and sales price. 
Long-Term Capital Gains 
Qualified long-term capital gains are taxed at a special rate below the usual 
tax rate, so you benefit from favorable tax treatment for property held longer 
than twelve months. The calculation of taxable gain or loss includes closing 
costs at the point of purchase and sale, additional capital improvements 
made while you owned the property, recapture of depreciation, and 
adjustments in the basis of the property if you deferred a gain on investment 
property previously. 
Deferred gain works in this way: If you own a rental property and you sell 
it reporting a gain, you can defer that gain if you replace the investment 
property with a similar property that costs as much or more, within a 
specified period of time. (This exchange rule is explained in more detail later 
in this chapter.)

[ 187 ]
EXAMPLE: You purchased a rental property for $135,000 and, a few years 
later, sold it for an adjusted price of $160,000. You had a gain of 
$25,000 and you met the rules for deferring the gain. The profit of 
$25,000 is carried over, and the basis in the new property is reduced 
by that amount. You purchased a new property for $175,000 for use 
as a rental. With the deferred gain from the first property, your adjusted 
basis is reduced to $150,000. 
A worksheet for calculating net gain or loss on investment property is shown 
in Figure 9-1.

Selling Your Primary Residence 
The rules for selling your primary residence are different. A married couple 
can exclude up to $500,000 of gain from the sale of their house, and a single 
person can exclude $250,000. You are required to use your home as your 
primary residence for at least two years during the five years prior to sale, and 
you cannot claim this exemption more than once during a two-year period. 
Beyond that, the exemption of gain can be claimed as many times as possible.

The profit or loss on your real estate investments is separate from the 
reporting of gain on a primary residence. However, the special exclusion 
of tax on gain for your residence raises an interesting planning point. You 
can avoid or defer taxes on capital gains from real estate investing in one 
of two ways. First, you can execute a “like-kind” exchange, buying a new 
investment property upon the sale of an older one (see “Like-Kind 
Exchanges” later in this chapter). Second, you can convert a rental property 
to your primary residence. In this case, you would need to meet the 
two-year rule and would still have to pay taxes for the recapture of all 
depreciation claimed.
CONVERTING A RENTAL PROPERTY 
When you convert, it simply means that you move into the house you have 
been using as a rental and live there for at least two years before selling it. If 
you then have a gain upon sale, the only portion that would be taxed would 
be depreciation recapture. Of course, this requires considerable advance 
planning. You have to put in the two-year period as primary residence over 
a five-year term. For example, let’s say that you have been living in your 
current house for at least two years. If you convert it to a rental for the next 
three years and then sell it, you will be able to claim the primary residence 
exclusion—as long as you did not sell another property within two years and 
make a similar claim. 
Some Tax Rules to Note 
The depreciation recapture cannot be avoided, even upon conversion from 
rental to primary residence. You are always required to pay capital gains tax 
upon sale of any property for which a depreciation expense has been claimed. 
Similarly, you have to pay taxes on any deferred gain, even if a rental 
property is later converted to a primary residence. For example, if you 
bought a rental property for $125,000 and later sold it for $150,000, you 
could defer the $25,000 profit by going through a like-kind exchange. 
However, if you later converted the new property to your primary residence 
and then sold it, you would have to divide the profit into two segments. The 
first segment is the taxable portion, consisting of the deferred gain and 
depreciation recapture; the second segment is the remaining profit that is 
qualified for exclusion under the primary residence rule. (This includes the 
requirement that you use the property at least two years during the five-year 
period before the sale and the limitation that you have not claimed the 
exemption on another property within the last two years.) 

understanding tHe taX rules for real estate 
[ 189 ]
Importance of Timing 
This limitation—that you can claim the residential exemption only once in 
a two-year period—has to be kept in mind when you are timing your 
decisions to sell property, especially when it is property used as a primary 
residence or that has been converted. 
EXAMPLE: You own two properties. The first one was your primary residence 
until thirty months ago, at which time you converted it to a rental. The 
second is your current primary residence, which you purchased thirty 
months ago. You have decided to sell your properties and move from 
the area, so both properties are placed on the market. 
Which property should you claim? In this example, both properties would 
qualify for the exemption of gain because you lived in each as a primary 
residence for at least two years over the past five years. However, you can 
claim only one property within a two-year period. So it would be wise to 
claim the exemption for the property with the higher capital gain in order to 
reduce your tax burden. The only other choice would be to defer selling your 
current primary residence for two years, so that you would be able to avoid 
taxes on that property as well. By converting it to a rental and waiting two 
years, you would still qualify for the two-year/five-year rule and could 
exempt all gain, except depreciation recapture. 
You could not make the same move on the property you converted thirty 
months ago. By waiting the two years, you would no longer meet the 
requirement that you used it as a primary residence for at least two out of 
the last five years. You have lived in your present primary residence for 
thirty months; an additional twenty-four months would take the total up to 
fifty-four months, during which time the property was not a primary 
residence. That leaves only six months during the last five years, disqualifying 
it for the two-year/five-year restriction. 
Does conversion make practical sense? Converting property from an 
investment to a primary residence is a wise tax-saving move, as long as it 
also makes practical sense. However, you may not view a rental property as 
meeting your requirements for a primary residence, so it may be impractical 
to move your family into a property that is simply not suitable. You may also 
be unwilling to wait two full years before selling the property. Investors 
often need to cash out as soon as possible, which is one of the most common 
reasons for wanting to sell an investment property. Considering the personal 
EXAMPLE

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 190 ]
preferences for your primary residence and your need for cash, it may not 
make sense to convert rental property just to avoid capital gains taxes. 
How do you establish a primary residence when you convert a property? 
This is a record-keeping and documentation problem that has to be thought 
through. Your mailing address is usually your primary residence, although 
many people use post office boxes or mail drops instead of receiving mail at 
their homes. You can establish primary residence by keeping copies of paid 
utility bills, subscriptions, and other mail showing that you were present at 
the property. You use your primary residence address in most cases when 
you file your income tax return. Your employer also keeps records of your 
primary residence to mail out tax information forms at the end of the year. 
Once you begin thinking about it, establishing the location of your primary 
residence, as well as the dates you lived there, is not difficult. 
LIKE-KIND EXCHANGES 
As a real estate investor, you can defer taxes on gains from property 
indefinitely, as long as you invest proceeds in properties that are equal or 
greater in value, and as long as you reinvest within 180 days from the sale 
date. That means a subsequent purchase has to be closed within that period. 
The tax deferral of gain from investment property is known as a 1031 ex-
change (named after IRC Code Section 1031). 
This election is more commonly called a like-kind exchange because 
qualified property has to be of the same type. If you have one rental and you 
exchange it for another, that is like-kind property. You can trade a house for 
a duplex or apartment or switch between residential and commercial, but as 
long as it remains rental property, the gain can be deferred. You can even 
exchange improved property for raw land, or vice versa, and have it qualify 
as a like-kind exchange. The one exception regarding real estate is that both 
properties in the exchange have to be within the United States. Foreign 
properties do not qualify. 
WHere to looK RS Publication 544, “Sales and Other Dispositions 
of Assets,” includes the specific rules for 1031 exchanges. It can be 
downloaded from the Internal Revenue Service’s Web site at https://www.
irs.gov/publications/p544.

understanding tHe taX rules for real estate 
[ 191 ]
Specific Rules for the Exchange 
The rules to qualify for the exchange are specific. When you sell one 
property, you are required to identify and complete the purchase of another 
property within 180 days from sale. As part of this timing requirement, you 
need to identify property you intend to purchase as a like-kind exchange 
within forty-five days from sale; this is known as the identification period. 
Because of this requirement, it may be necessary to identify more than one 
potential property, so that if a sale falls through, you will not be precluded 
from completing a 1031 exchange. 
Hiring a Qualified Intermediary 
You cannot execute a like-kind exchange yourself. You need to hire a 
facilitator, or a “qualified intermediary,” to complete the paperwork and to 
act as go-between for both sides of the transaction (you as exchanger and 
the seller of the new property). Even though you have to pay a facilitator for 
the services, it is a wise idea. You want to ensure that the like-kind exchange 
is not disallowed because you didn’t file in time or provide the proper 
notification. For example, when you make a written offer on a property, you 
need to include a statement advising the seller that you are purchasing the 
property as part of a 1031 exchange, and the seller needs to agree to 
cooperate in that exchange. A facilitator can help in phrasing this notification 
properly, as well as in making sure all deadlines are met. 
The facilitator is necessary in the transaction because you, as seller, are not 
allowed to receive money or property before the transfer has been completed. 
The facilitator has to take legal title to the new property and then transfer it 
to you, or else the deferral will not be allowed. The facilitator enters into a 
written agreement with you specifying the terms and conditions of the 
exchange; therefore, the individual cannot be related to you. Furthermore, the 
facilitator cannot have been an employee, accountant, attorney, or broker 
working for you for at least two years before the transaction. 
When to Elect the 1031 Exchange 
The 1031 exchange is a useful election when you want to continue investing 
in real estate and when you want to upgrade from one property to another. 
For example, if you have one or more single-family houses and you want to 
exchange them for a single apartment house, a 1031 exchange can be 
executed so that all of your profits are deferred. Electing the 1031 exchange 
does not mean you escape liability for the taxes, only that the tax is put off 
until you sell the exchanged property. 

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 192 ]
The timing limitation of 180 days can be a problem when you are trying 
to sell several properties. Unless your local market is very strong, you may 
have a problem disposing of several properties within that relatively short 
window. You may require the help of a skilled real estate agent, working in 
cooperation with your 1031 exchange facilitator, to ensure that you meet 
your deadlines. 
If you want to dispose of a rental property but you do not want to invest 
in another, a 1031 exchange makes no sense because it keeps you tied into 
the market. One exception is when you don’t want to sell because you need 
the money but you want to defer the taxes. You can exchange a rental 
property for raw land and qualify for the exchange. Because it will have no 
tenants, raw land is low maintenance. You must pay property taxes, of 
course, but you could defer taxes on your profit by trading out of a rental 
situation. 
The alternative discussed previously—turning investment property into 
your primary residence—is easier to execute and also may help you to avoid 
taxes. Unlike the 1031 exchange, in which taxes are merely deferred, the 
transfer from investment property to primary residence allows you to sell tax 
free for the entire profit, except depreciation recapture and any previously 
deferred gain. 
WatcH tHis In any matters involving tax avoidance or deferral, you 
should consult with an expert tax adviser before making any decisions. 
An error in timing, filing the wrong form, or not being aware of changes 
in the rules can all cause expensive tax consequences. Because tax rules 
change from time to time, you need to make sure that the rules in effect 
when this book was published continue in effect when you are making 
decisions about your property. 
RULES FOR PROPERTIES  
USED PARTLY AS RENTALS 
When your primary residence is partially rented out, you must break down 
the tax deductions between personal expense and rental expense. This rule 
applies when (a) you rent out a portion of your home or (b) the property is 
a rental for part of the year and your primary residence for the remainder. 
When you use your primary residence in this manner, you need to keep 
good records to document your calculation of the division of expenses. The 
portion assigned to personal use includes mortgage interest and property 

understanding tHe taX rules for real estate 
[ 193 ]
taxes. The portion assigned to rental use includes deductions for depreciation, 
utilities, mortgage interest, and property taxes, plus any other rental expense. 
However, you can deduct only the portion of those expenses that applies to 
the rental. 
EXAMPLE: You rented out a room in your home for nine months last year. 
The size of the area rented out was 900 square feet, and the total 
square footage of your house is 3,100. By this calculation, 29 percent 
of expenses can be deducted. This includes 29 percent of the 
full-year depreciation, utilities, property taxes and mortgage interest, 
and all other expenses that apply to the rental. (If you advertise the 
rental, for example, you can deduct 100 percent of the cost of 
advertising, since it applies solely to rental investment and not to 
personal use.) 
In this example, 29 percent of property taxes and mortgage interest are 
listed as rental expense; therefore, the remaining 71 percent would be listed 
as itemized deductions. If your deductions are marginal between itemizing 
and claiming a standard deduction, this calculation could result in tax 
savings. For example, if the standard deduction is higher than the total of 
your calculated itemized deductions (after deducting the portion applicable 
to rental), then your taxes will be lower by claiming the standard deduction 
instead of itemizing your deductions. 
Less Than Clear-Cut Division of Use 
The precise calculation of rental division is relatively easy when you rent out 
an in-law unit with its own kitchen and bath. However, when you rent out 
a room and allow a tenant access to your kitchen, living room, bathroom, 
laundry room, and other areas, you need to arrive at a reasonable calculation 
of the rental portion of total expenses. 
Several possible methods of calculation are worth exploring. These 
include: 
 
Number of People Living in the Home. This calculation assumes that all 
people residing in the home make about the same degree of use of common 
areas: kitchen, living room, and bathroom. It has two parts. First, you 
calculate the rented square feet as a percentage of total square feet; second, 
you calculate the percentage of people renting (versus total residents) and 
apply that to the remaining square feet. 
EXAMPLE

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 194 ]
EXAMPLE: Your home has 3,100 square feet and you rent out a room of 
900 square feet. Your family contains four people, so a total of five 
people live in the home. Your common areas (those areas accessible to 
all household members) are calculated at 1,050 square feet. The 
calculation of the percentage that applies to rents is: 
1 ÷ 5 = 20% (the percentage of people renting) 
1,050 × 20% = 210 (square feet of common areas shared with  
the renter) 
900 + 210 = 1,110 (total square feet assigned to rental) 
1,110 ÷ 3,100 = 36% (percentage of shared-space expenses  
that apply to renter) 
In this example, you are allowed to deduct 36 percent of interest, property 
taxes, insurance, utilities, and depreciation as rental expenses; the remaining 
64 percent of interest and property taxes are listed as itemized deductions. 
 
Rental Income as a Percentage of Mortgage Payment. An alternative method 
for making the calculation is to treat rental income as a percentage of your 
total mortgage payment. In this example, let’s assume that the rental 
income you receive each month is $400, and your total mortgage payment 
is $1,314. In this case, 30 percent would be the applicable percentage of 
expenses you would be allowed to deduct against rental income. 
 
Rent Charged as a Percentage of Overall Market Rent. A third method is to 
calculate the fair market rent for a house such as yours. For example, in 
your city, the typical four-bedroom, two-bath home may rent for $1,200 
per month. Since you are collecting $400 in rent, it is reasonable to assume 
that the applicable percentage of deductions is 33 percent, or one-third of 
the fair market rent you could collect if you rented out the entire house. 
WHere to looK Check IRS Publication 527 to study rules 
concerning mixed-use residential rental property. This publication can be 
downloaded from the IRS’s Web site at https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/
p527.pdf.
As long as you apply a method consistently from one year to the next to 
calculate rental expenses, you can use the one that yields the most 
advantageous outcome. In the earlier example, breaking down the square 

understanding tHe taX rules for real estate 
[ 195 ]
footage provided the most advantage because you can deduct the largest 
percentage (36 percent) of total expenses as rental expenses. The higher the 
percentage assigned to rental activity, the higher your deductible expenses. 
You cannot deduct anything beyond interest and property taxes as part of 
your itemized deductions. Therefore, it is advantageous to assign a larger 
percentage to rental activity, as long as your assumptions are fair and 
supportable. And if you end up using the standard deduction instead of 
itemizing as a result of assigning a higher portion of interest and taxes to the 
rental portion, your taxes will be lower.
As far as interest and property taxes are concerned, you are allowed to 
deduct the entire amount regardless of how much is assigned to personal use 
and how much to rental investment. The difference in how much you pay in 
taxes is the result of the percentage of other expenses you can deduct. 
STATE TAX LIABILITIES 
The rules for state income taxes vary considerably. Treatment of real estate 
income, expenses, depreciation, and deductibility of losses depends on 
current state law. Even tax rates on the state level are inconsistent. 
A few states assess no income tax. The remaining states impose either a 
flat rate or a graduating rate. Each state’s tax requirements are different 
because of state-level economics and legislative policy. 
WHat to do To determine the impact of real estate rental activity on 
your state income tax rates, check with your state’s tax agency or with 
your tax adviser. Tax forms for each state can be downloaded on several 
Web sites, including the Tax Foundation at http://taxfoundation.org/
article/state-individual-income-tax-rates-and-brackets-2016.
If a particular state imposes rules that are different from the federal rules 
for the treatment of losses, you will need to recalculate your deductions 
and taxable income. Some states further require you to include a copy of 
your federal tax return with the state return that you file and to reconcile 
any differences in reported income and deductions. This extra burden 
makes the record-keeping rules more difficult for you as a real estate 
investor. 
You may also need to recalculate depreciation that you claim on your real 
estate investments. A state does not necessarily adopt the federal depreciation 
rules for the purpose of calculating state taxes. Therefore, it may be necessary 

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 196 ]
to keep two different records of depreciation, one each for federal and state 
calculations. When you eventually sell an investment property, the taxable 
gain will be different because of these inconsistencies. 
KeY Point In assessing the tax benefits of real estate investment, the 
state implications have to be reviewed carefully. Federal rules allow 
deductions of passive activities and tax-deferred exchanges of investment 
property (and tax-free sale of primary residence), all as incentives for real 
estate investors. The states do not automatically provide the same 
benefits. 
The tax rules for real estate are complex and include many special provisions. 
Consult with a tax adviser for tax planning, especially if you have high 
income from non–real estate investments, wages, or self-employment. The 
many questions concerning how to position yourself to reduce taxes legally 
are complicated when you add in the state tax issues. The state rules do not 
always conform to the federal rules, so elections you make this year could 
have an effect on both federal and state liabilities. This is where the help of 
an expert can be useful; you want to follow all of the rules, reduce your 
overall taxes within the law, and ensure that you have not missed any 
potential deductions.

TAX REPORTING  
FOR ANNUAL INCOME  
AND EXPENSE
A
s an investor in real estate, your tax-reporting requirements are more 
complex than for most other types of investments. For example, if you 
invest only in stocks and mutual funds, you report interest and dividends on 
Schedule B and capital gains on Schedule D of Form 1040. Beyond that, 
there are usually no special schedules to file. 
For real estate transactions, you must also report the income and expense 
on Schedule E, along with depreciation, passive loss limitations, and 
like-kind exchanges on specialized schedules. This chapter provides blank 
copies and examples for each of the applicable forms. 
HOW TO REPORT REAL ESTATE  
TRANSACTIONS USING FORM 1040 
Everyone is familiar with IRS Form 1040, the summary page of every tax 
return. All schedules and forms that are a part of your tax return are 
summarized on the 1040. In the case of real estate investments, you have to 
transfer data from Schedule E, where income, expenses, and profit or loss 
are summarized. This is the primary schedule for your year-to-year real 
estate activity. 
The two pages of Form 1040 are shown in Figures 10-1(a) and 10-1(b). 
The net profit or loss from real estate is reported on line 17, brought over 
from the bottom line from Schedule E. If you sold investment real estate 
during the year, you would also show an entry on line 13, capital gains and 
losses, the total of which is transferred over from Schedule D. 

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 198 ]
Real estate transactions are reported in a manner similar to business 
income, which would be reported on Schedule C (for sole proprietorships), 
with additional information provided on other tax schedules or by 
supplementary schedules. The depreciation form, number 4562, is filled in 
to supply further information for one line on Schedule E. The net profit or 
loss reported on Schedule E is then carried over and reported on Form 
1040, line 17. 
Figure 10-2 shows the flow of information for the typical year-to-year 
reporting of real estate profit and loss. 
Schedule A—Itemized Deductions 
You also need to use Schedule A if you own your own home. If you rent out 
a portion of your home, the interest and property tax expenses are split 
between itemized deductions and rental investment expenses. Figure 10-3 
shows an example of Schedule A.
Itemizing vs. the Standard Deduction 
The determination of the proper division of interest and taxes raises an 
interesting strategic point concerning Schedule A. For example, for 2003, a 
married couple had a choice between itemizing or taking $9,500 as a standard 
deduction. Your combined interest and taxes (and other deductions) may 
exceed $9,500; however, if a portion of that total is properly assigned to rental 
investment expense, your remaining Schedule A deductions could be below the 
maximum standard deduction level. In that case, it would be advantageous for 
you to claim the standard deduction, since it would lower your taxable income 
and the total tax due. 
EXAMPLE: You and your spouse own a home with a separate in-law unit that 
you rented out last year. According to your measurement of the square 
footage, the rental is 30 percent of the total. You record 30 percent of 
mortgage interest and property taxes as rental expense on Schedule E 
and 70 percent as itemized deductions on Schedule A. You have no 
other itemized deductions to claim. 

taX rePorting for annual incoMe and eXPense 
[ 199 ]
Last year, your total mortgage interest was $9,618 and your property 
taxes were $705. The sum of these two expenses was clearly above the 
standard deduction of $9,500 for a married couple in 2003. However, when 
you record only 70 percent as itemized deductions, you end up with $6,733 
interest and $494 in property taxes, or a total of $7,227. 
In this case, you will reduce your total taxes by claiming the standard 
deduction of $9,500. Even if your tax rate is only 10 percent overall, 
claiming the standard deduction based on the previous example will reduce 
your taxes by more than $200 for the year. Is the proposed 10 percent rate 
realistic? It is, in fact, because the depreciation and other deductions that 
real estate investors are allowed to claim reduce taxable income 
significantly. The 10 percent rate can be achieved for many people in the 
middle-income range. 
In the decision to itemize or use the standard deduction, you need to 
select the method that provides you with the greater advantage. In the 
previous example, it’s to your advantage to take the standard deduction. 
But you’re better off itemizing if the total of itemized deductions is higher 
than the amount allowed using the standard deduction. If your itemized 
deductions exceed the standard deduction even after assigning a portion 
of your interest and taxes to investment expense, then you would be better 
off itemizing. 
Planning Point What if itemized deductions and the standard 
deduction are very close? If you have numerous itemized deductions for 
interest and points, gifts to charity, and miscellaneous other deductions, 
you are entitled to list and claim them. But if the total is within a few 
hundred dollars of the standard deduction, it could be wise to simply 
forego itemizing. That reduces your exposure to audit and also simplifies 
your tax return. 
Schedule E—Income and Expense 
Schedule E is used to summarize income and expenses for each property. If 
you carry over unused losses, you can deduct them in future years when you 
sell a specific property or when you report passive gains. Therefore, keeping 
accurate records by property is essential. Figures 10-4(a) and 10-4(b) show 
the two pages of Schedule E. (Note: The second page of Schedule E does not 
relate specifically to real estate investment activities.) 

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 200 ]
Filling Out Schedule E 
For a single property, the reporting of income and expenses is straightforward. 
The items in your checking account, plus any cash expenses and other 
transactions not shown in your account, are categorized and listed on the 
form. You need to adjust for interest expenses and impound payments based 
on the information supplied by your lender. 
Income. The easiest reporting occurs when you have a single rental property 
that is rented out full-time and is not used at all as a primary residence. To 
keep your records as clear as possible, it is desirable to run all rental income 
through a checking account established specifically for rental activity. In this 
way, your bank deposits will agree with the total of rental receipts plus any 
additional funds you transfer from your other accounts. 
Payments. The record of transactions is also made easier when all of your 
rental-related payments are made from the same rental-specific checking 
account. The larger payments will be made for monthly mortgage payments, 
insurance, and property taxes. The interest portion of your mortgage payments 
is fully deductible as an expense on Schedule E. Your lender will provide you 
with a tax form at the end of each year, listing the total interest you paid. 
Insurance you pay for hazard and mortgage coverage is also fully deductible 
as long as the property was used exclusively as a rental. Property taxes, if paid 
directly, are made twice a year to your local county tax authority. 
Impounds. If your lender impounds a monthly amount for property taxes 
and insurance, you need to report the correct amount in these two categories. 
That is not the total of impounds withheld but the specific payments made 
by your lender from the impounds it collected each month. The lender will 
send you a summary of impound activity each year, which will include 
identification of insurance and tax payments. 
Additional Expenses. Other expenses are reported on the applicable line on 
the first page of Schedule E. Some expenses do not have a specific line and 
have to be added in via the spaces provided at the end of the printed list. So 
payments for office supplies and expenses such as telephone and landscaping, 
for example, will be reported on those lines. 
Net Income (or Loss). Cash expenses are added up, a subtotal is shown, and 
below that, the total of depreciation expenses is recorded. The net income is 
shown on line 24 or net loss on line 25; the total is then carried over to be 
reported on the first page of your tax return, Form 1040, on line 17. As 

taX rePorting for annual incoMe and eXPense 
[ 201 ]
explained in Chapter 9, you have two limitations in claiming expenses for 
rental activity: 
1. One is the maximum loss you can claim per year, which is 
$25,000. 
2. The other is the reduction in that loss level when your modified 
adjusted gross income is higher than $100,000. For every dollar 
above $100,000, you lose 50 cents in deductible losses; if your 
adjusted gross income is $150,000 or more, you cannot claim any 
loss from real estate activity. 
Reporting Losses 
If the total is a loss, you have two possible restrictions. If the loss exceeds 
$25,000, the excess has to be carried forward to be used in the future. And 
if your modified adjusted gross income is greater than $100,000, your 
deductible loss will be further reduced. In either of these cases, you are 
required to complete Form 8582, Passive Activity Loss Limitations. This 
three-page form is shown in Figures 10-5(a), 10-5(b), and 10-5(c) on pages 
215–217. 
Record the amount of loss from real estate activities on line 1b of Form 
8582. If you have any prior years’ unused losses, they are recorded on line 
1c. The total of 1b and 1c is then entered on line 1d. The total is also recorded 
on line 4. 
Part II of the form is used to calculate reductions in the allowed 
maximum loss deduction when your modified adjusted gross income is 
greater than $100,000. The total allowed maximum loss is recorded on 
lines 10 and 16. The second page of Form 8582 contains a series of 
worksheets that identify overall gain or loss, unallowed losses to be carried 
forward, and allocation of losses by property. This exercise is not only 
used as part of your tax return; it also provides a useful record for writing 
off future unused losses when you sell a specific property. The worksheets 
continue on page 3 of the form.

Getting the Most Out of Your Deductions 
This brings up an interesting planning consideration for those who do rent 
out a portion of their primary residence. If you will not be able to claim a 
loss because your income exceeds $150,000 (or if your loss is restricted 
because your adjusted gross income is between $100,000 and $150,000), 
you have every incentive to claim as little as possible in rental expense for 
interest and taxes. In this situation, you want to use a method that provides 
the smallest rental expense and the largest itemized deduction. You can base 
the division of expenses on square feet, number of people living on the 
premises, or percentage of market rent levels, for example. If your deductions 
for rental expenses cannot be fully claimed, it becomes desirable and 
economical to assign as much as possible of your interest and property tax 
expense to Schedule A. 
EXAMPLE: Last year you rented out 30 percent of your primary residence 
and received $4,800 in rents. You also owned a rental for the entire 
year and received $14,400. A summary of rental income and expense 
on each of these properties is shown in Table 10-1. Expenses for 
cleaning, insurance, mortgage interest, taxes, and utilities for Property 
A were calculated as 30 percent of the total, with the other 70 percent 
assigned to your personal use. Mortgage interest and taxes were 
assigned 30 percent to this schedule and 70 percent to itemized 
deductions on Schedule A.

If you compare Table 10-1 to Figure 10-4, you can see how these details fit 
into Schedule E. The table includes references to each line on Schedule E. 
The “total” column corresponds to those columns on the schedule that 
require a total: rents received, mortgage interest, total expenses and 
depreciation, and net income or loss. 
Depreciation and Amortization 
In addition to reporting any excess passive losses that are to be carried 
forward, you need to fill out Form 4562, Depreciation and Amortization. 
This form summarizes your claimed expense for each year; in addition, you 
may need to add a supplementary schedule showing the breakdown of 
depreciation. A sample of Form 4562 (two pages) is shown in Figures 10-6(a) 
and 10-6(b). 
EXAMPLE: Last year you claimed depreciation for two properties. You 
depreciated 30 percent of your primary residence based on your 
calculation of applicable square feet; you also claimed depreciation for 
a rental property you owned for the entire year. 
In this example, you owned both properties for the entire year, so all 
depreciation should be reported on line 17 and also on line 22 of Form 4562. 
Table 10-2 shows a typical supplementary schedule that would be attached 
to your tax return to provide more details on claimed depreciation.

Documenting Large Expenses 
Reporting real estate transactions can involve some large numbers, notably 
for interest and property taxes. How do you document these expenses? 
Interest Paid. A bank or savings institution is required to send you and the IRS 
an annual report called Form 1098. It identifies the loan and the total interest 
you paid during the year. You should ensure that the amount you computed 
and reported on your tax return agrees with the total reported to you on Form 
1098. You may also wish to attach a copy of this form to your tax return for 
each property in order to document the expense that you are claiming. If you 
divide your primary residence interest between Schedule A and Schedule E, you 
should also attach a summary of your calculation. You may show the calculation 
right on the copy of Form 1098 that you attach to your return. For example: 

taX rePorting for annual incoMe and eXPense 
[ 205 ]
Total interest = $9,618 
Total square feet in the property = 3,400 
Total square feet in the rental unit = 1,020 = 30% × 3,400 
Interest included on Schedule E = 30% × $9,618 = $2,885 
Interest included as itemized deduction = 70% × $9,618 = $6,733 
KeY Point If you end up claiming a standard deduction instead of 
itemizing, it does not matter. This brief summary supports what you have 
claimed as applicable to rental activity, based on total square footage of 
your property. 
Property Taxes. It may also be desirable to attach documentation of other 
major expenses, such as property taxes. This is especially worthwhile if you 
divide the expense between the two schedules. Attach a copy of the bill from 
your county, with the breakdown clearly shown. For example: 
Total property taxes = $705 
Total square feet in the property = 3,400 
Total square feet in the rental unit = 1,020 = 30% × 3,400 
Taxes included on Schedule E = 30% × $705 = $211 
Taxes included as itemized deduction = 70% × $705 = $494 
How Much Documentation to Provide 
Opinions vary on whether you should attach documentation to your tax 
return proving expenses or showing your breakdown. One school of thought 
states that you should not supply any information that is not specifically 
required. The other school of thought contends that by proving an expense 
up front, you anticipate and answer questions before they are asked. Both 
sides make valid points. The decision should be based on your exposure to 
a possible audit and on whether it is worthwhile to provide documentation 
with the idea of preventing an audit from happening. 
Providing documentation along with your tax return may help ward off 
an audit. If a tax return is selected for audit and reviewed, having 
documentation attached will answer the big questions. For example, it may 
be that your return is pulled because you claim a very high expense for 

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 206 ]
interest and taxes. If the IRS were to audit your return, they may also ask to 
see receipts for utilities, office expenses, legal fees, cleaning, and other items. 
However, if the major items have been explained, then auditing the other 
line items would not be necessary. 
KeY Point Maintaining complete, accurate records will enable you to 
successfully handle an audit in most cases. It’s up to you how much 
documentation to provide along with your return.
FORM 4797 AND SCHEDULE D— 
SALE OF RENTAL PROPERTY 
Beyond the year-to-year reporting of rental income and expense, you also 
need to fill in special forms to report capital gains on rental property for the 
year in which you sell. For this, you use Form 4797 and Schedule D. A 
sample of Form 4797 is shown in Figures 10-7(a) and 10-7(b).
Why two different forms for one transaction? Form 4797 is used to report 
sales of investment properties. The details are listed on this form, with the 
single-line profit or loss transferred to Schedule D, which summarizes capital 
gains or losses. The totals from Schedule D are then transferred to line 13 of 
Form 1040. The system is set up so that you can report all activity in the 
right place. For example, if you sell a property and also had capital gain 
distributions from mutual fund shares and, perhaps, a net loss from selling 
stock, all of your capital gains and losses end up on Schedule D. 
A summary of the flow of information between schedules is shown in 
Figure 10-8.
A sample of Form 4797 (two pages) is shown in Figures 10-9(a) and 
10-9(b).
The flow of reporting information for rental property capital gains is 
shown in Figure 10-8. The reported gain or loss is transferred from Form 
4797 to Schedule D and then onto Form 1040. This volume of forms is 
necessary. Schedule D is designed to report all capital gains and losses, 
including those reported on Form 4797 and those shown only on Schedule 
D. The need for several specialized forms comes from the need for uniformity.

[ 207 ]
EXAMPLE: You sold a property in 2015 that you bought two years before 
and realized a gain. The adjusted sales price was $147,366. You had 
claimed depreciation while you owned the property totaling $5,119; 
your original net purchase price was $119,417. Your net capital gain of 
$33,068 would be reported on Form 4797 as shown on Table 10-3.

This information is transferred to Schedule D—the two-page form shown in 
Figures 10-9(a) and 10-9(b). The net capital gain of $33,068 is reported on 
that schedule on lines 11, 15, and in Part III, line 16.
KeY Point The distinction between short-term and long-term capital 
gains is important because they are taxed differently. Taxes on long-term 
gains (i.e., assets held more than one year) are lower than those on 
short-term gains, which are taxed at the same rate as other taxable income.
REPORTING LIKE-KIND EXCHANGES 
As a real estate investor, a final form that you may need to complete is Form 
8824, for reporting like-kind exchanges. These exchanges (1031 exchanges) 
allow you to defer taxes to a future sale. A sample of Form 8824 (four pages) 
is shown in Figures 10-10(a) and 10-10(b). 

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 208 ]
Following the Specific Rules 
In a like-kind exchange, you are required to follow very precise rules for the 
timing of transactions and dollar amounts of replacement property. The 
purchase of replacement property has to be completed within 180 days of 
the sale of the original property. In a like-kind exchange, the gain on sale of 
investment property is deferred until you sell the replacement property, and 
this is achieved by reducing the basis in new property. For example, instead 
of reporting the current-year profit of $33,068 on Schedule D (see previous 
example), you may have been able to execute a like-kind exchange by 
purchasing another real estate investment. 
EXAMPLE: You sold a rental property last year for $147,366 and replaced 
it with a like-kind exchange property. You bought the new property for 
an adjusted purchase price of $161,220 and closed the sale within the 
180-day window. 
In this example, your $33,068 profit reduces your basis in the new 
property. Although your adjusted purchase price was $161,220, your basis 
for tax purposes is calculated as shown in Table 10-4.
TABLE 10-4. ADJUSTED BASIS ($)
Adjusted purchase price
161,220
Less: Deferred gain
 33,068
Adjusted basis
128,152
KeY Point  When you eventually sell this newly acquired property, 
your gain will be reported not as the difference between purchase price 
and sale price but between basis and sale price. This is how gains are 
deferred in like-kind exchanges.
The rules for reporting real estate transactions can be quite complex. You 
may need to use the services of a qualified tax adviser, especially in those 
years when your transactions include capital gains or losses, like-kind 
exchanges, or adjustments in the passive losses you are allowed to deduct.

INCLUDING REAL ESTATE IN 
YOUR PORTFOLIO
T
he decision to invest in real estate cannot be made in isolation. You must 
review real estate’s attributes, both positive and negative, while taking a 
broader look at your entire portfolio, the limitations of your personal 
resources, risk factors, and your personal temperament and willingness to 
be involved with investments requiring your personal touch. 
Some investors find the idea of investing in rental real estate very 
appealing. The direct control, tax benefits, potential for positive cash flow, 
and strong historical record of rising market value make real estate one of 
the most desirable types of investments. Even when the stock market is 
weak, people need a place to live. In most regions, real estate prices have 
performed well even when the overall economy has been poor. This does not 
mean that every possible market is going to exhibit positive signs; some areas 
are depressed and will remain so over the long term, so you need to research 
the market beforehand. 
Real estate markets are always very local. The national averages have less 
to do with value than local factors: demand for rentals, market price of rents 
versus the cost of real estate, the local job market, and other social and 
cultural trends. You may live in an area with strong rental demand and low 
real estate prices, the best possible situation. Or you could live in an area 
where a lot of vacancies have driven down the market rents, but real estate 
prices remain high. This occurs if rental units have been overbuilt or if the 
local economy has changed and workers have left the area. 
It would be a mistake to assume that all markets reflect national averages. 
It would also be a mistake to make an investment decision without first 
looking at the real estate market in your town. Beyond that, you also need 

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 228 ]
to allow sensible tests to ensure that real estate investing is the right move 
for you. 
ALTERNATIVES TO DIRECT OWNERSHIP
If you want to invest in real estate but are not ready to purchase properties 
on your own, you have choices. The rather complex limited partnership is of 
questionable value due to the difficulty in getting out of a deal once you have 
invested. So if you focus on more liquid choices, you enjoy greater control 
and get to move money into and out of an investment with ease.
The most obvious way is to invest in shares of stock in real estate builders. 
These organizations invest in land and build homes and other types of 
projects. Table 11-1 lists five of the better known real estate builders traded 
to the public. However, beyond these are many others worth considering 
as well.

Another alternative is the Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT). This is an 
investment group that pools investors’ funds and specializes in one or more 
areas: type of property, construction, or mortgage lending. There are dozens 
of different REITs, and these are worth exploring. One great advantage is 
that REIT shares trade publicly just like stocks in publicly listed companies.

including real estate in Your Portfolio
[ 229 ]
Organized very much like a mutual fund, a REIT is a conduit organization 
that pays out its earnings to shareholders. Shares are publicly traded, so you 
can buy and sell shares whenever you wish. This combines liquidity with a 
diversified real estate portfolio.
There are many choices in the type of REIT. An equity REIT buys properties 
and then rents or leases space to tenants, creating an income stream for 
shareholders. The pure hybrid REIT does not carry any debt on its books, so 
all income is paid out without needing to pay interest to a lender.
A mortgage REIT, in comparisons, acts as a lender. It grants loans or 
purchases existing loans on real estate, on a range of properties within its 
defined submarket, such as residential, industrial, or commercial properties.
The hybrid REIT contains elements of both equity and mortgage REITS. 
With dozens of possible REIT selections on the market, a starting point is 
to limit your search to the specific type of property each REIT pursues and 
also to decide whether to focus on equity, mortgage, or hybrid REITs.

In addition to the REIT market, you can also diversify through the purchase 
of shares in an Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). Unlike traditional mutual 
funds, the holdings each ETF has are identified in advance, and management 
fees are minimal as a result. This so-called basket of securities is easily 
identified by visiting the Web sites of ETF offerings.

Just like the REIT, an ETF is traded publicly. Shares can be bought and

REAL ESTATE AND ASSET ALLOCATION 
One underlying premise in financial planning is that your investment assets 
should be spread among dissimilar markets—so some capital is invested in 
stocks, some in savings accounts, and some in real estate. This idea—called 
asset allocation—is often confused with diversification, and in some 
applications, the two are really the same thing. The difference is an important 
one, however. 
A diversified portfolio spreads risks among several different products. For 
example, a diversified portfolio of stocks includes some blue chips, some 
small and unknown stocks with good growth potential, and, of course, a 
division among dissimilar industries. The purpose of diversification is to 
prevent losses from affecting the entire portfolio. If you own only computer 
stocks or retail stocks, a single low cycle or bad market season could affect 
all of the stocks in an undiversified portfolio. 
Asset allocation achieves a form of diversification, but it goes much 
further. It is the process of dividing up investment capital among different 
markets. This serves varying purposes and also helps you to build a base of 
safety and growth for a portion of your portfolio while pursuing current 
income or aggressive growth in another. Many investors have allocated their 

including real estate in Your Portfolio
[ 231 ]
assets unconsciously, as a matter of common sense. They own their own 
home and are paying the mortgage over many years. They have a savings 
account and regularly place money in shares of two or three mutual funds. 
They also own some stocks directly. This is a popular form of asset 
allocation. Degrees of capital are found in the real estate market, the stock 
market, and the money market. 
Tailoring Asset Allocation to Your Own Situation 
Asset allocation should be designed with your particular circumstances in 
mind. No single formula is going to work for everyone, even though some 
advisers offer ratio breakdowns that everyone should use. To merely suggest 
that you should invest 40 percent each in stocks and real estate, then keep 
20 percent in cash accounts, ignores the reality that you might be better off 
spreading your money around in different portions. In addition, you may 
have a particular bias for or against the stock market or even real estate, for 
example. So the general advice to apply a set formula to achieve asset 
allocation is hollow. It is a misconception to believe that any one plan will 
work for everyone. 
Spreading Risk 
The idea of allocating resources is not meant simply to spread money 
around. It also spreads different types of risks, which is one of the more 
important aspects to asset allocation. For example, it would be unwise to 
invest 100 percent in real estate, since direct ownership is an illiquid 
investment. You need to have some cash reserves available, but the only 
way to get investment capital out of real estate is to either sell or refinance. 
By the same argument, it would not make sense to place 100 percent of 
your capital in the stock market, where market-wide changes can lead to 
losses in an entire portfolio. 
Knowing Your Overall Investing Goals 
Asset allocation helps you to spread your capital among different markets 
with your overall investing goals in mind. You want to build equity in your 
home and, possibly, in real estate rentals as well. You also want to minimize 
your taxes, save for your children’s college and your own retirement, and 
insure your family against catastrophic losses. Most families have a complex 
number of financial requirements, some of which are in conflict with one 
another. For example, you may need life and health insurance, but that 
means there is not enough cash left over to build an emergency reserve. In 

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 232 ]
such instances you have to make choices. This is where the specific balance 
of asset allocation becomes essential. 
EXAMPLE: You would like to sell your mutual fund shares and use the cash 
to make a down payment on a rental property. In evaluating the cash 
flow situation, you are encouraged to discover that rental rates are 
strong in your town, that occupancy rates are high, and that real estate 
prices have been rising steadily in recent years. However, if you sell off 
one-half of your mutual fund assets, you will be able to make only a 
minimal down payment and, as a result, your mortgage payment will 
be higher than rental income. This negative cash flow presents a 
problem, and you are aware of the risk: If you were to lose your job, for 
example, having negative cash flow on your investment real estate 
could mean having to sell at a loss. As an alternative, you could sell all 
of your mutual fund shares and make a larger down payment. Having 
a much smaller mortgage would enable you to have positive cash flow 
as a result. 
This example demonstrates the tough choices that have to be made and 
why asset allocation has to be reviewed as part of the bigger picture. In the 
example, the concern was over cash flow, which is always of great importance 
in real estate investing. Are you better off keeping some mutual fund shares 
and dealing with negative cash flow? Or should you transfer the entire 
amount into a down payment and eliminate the cash flow problem? Or 
should you conclude that perhaps now is not the time to invest in real estate? 
Weighing Market and Personal Risk Factors 
In the previous example, it makes no sense to recommend that you should 
have a 40-40-20 percentage division of your capital. In fact, with all of the 
variables at play in the market—prices of property, demand for rental units, 
and market value trends—you have to make the decision based on an 
evaluation of the market and of the risks involved. Complicating the problem 
are the personal risk factors—for example, your family income and whether 
your spouse also works, your investment reserves and values, your sense of 
job security—which ultimately determine how the decision is made. 
Allocating assets should be the result of evaluating personal and market 
risk factors and then deciding whether to realign your assets. If you believe 
the potential in the real estate market is significant and that the likely growth 

including real estate in Your Portfolio
[ 233 ]
of mutual fund shares is not promising, it could make sense to move assets 
to real estate investments. But if your family income is barely adequate to 
meet your obligations today, negative or marginal cash flow could make the 
risk too high. In that case, a two- or three-month vacancy could destroy 
your finances, making the prospect of entering the real estate market less 
desirable. If the market factors are weak as well, it makes sense to wait. 
Some investors have made the mistake of getting into the market without 
evaluating their personal circumstances and the market, discovering too late 
that the timing was bad for such a move. By then, their capital is tied up, and 
the property cannot be sold without losing money. 
KeY Point If occupancy is erratic or low, market rents weak, and real 
estate prices flat or falling, or if your personal financial situation is too 
tenuous, it does not make sense to buy property today. First, review the 
market factors and your personal circumstances; then, be guided by the 
principles of asset allocation if the potential for real estate investing is 
strong and favorable. 
THE LEVERAGED ADVANTAGE 
Asset allocation involves a division of investment capital among markets 
with different attributes. It also should involve using money in different 
ways. For example, when you own stocks directly, you make or lose 
maximum money when the stock moves several points. If you buy shares of 
a mutual fund you have to pay a management fee, but your money is 
diversified among many different stocks. You may also own interest in a 
balanced fund that invests in both stocks and bonds, so the degree of 
diversification is more extensive. When you put money in a savings account, 
you are paid a very small rate of return but your money is safe and insured. 
In all of these examples, you reduce risk by placing capital in many different 
places, whether stocks, bonds, or cash accounts. In some types of accounts, 
you are exposed to market risk. With stocks, for example, you face the risk 
that market value may rise or fall. In other investments, you have more 
certainty, but, at the same time, you know you will earn less. For example, 
money placed in a savings account or certificate of insurance will yield a 
predictable but low interest rate, and your funds are insured in case of loss 
on the part of the savings institution.

A Winning Combination 
One attribute of real estate that distinguishes it from most other types of 
investment is the combination of higher-than-average yield, tax benefits, and 
insurance. Real estate, in comparison to most other investments, is illiquid. 
This means that you cannot get money out quickly or easily in most cases. 
However, the combined benefits make real estate a one-of-a-kind investment 
choice. Consider the fact that an insured property will grow in value as long 
as it is well cared for. The values of most investments are largely beyond your 
direct control. When you buy real estate, you ensure the value of the 
property—and a lot of its value is based on how you care for the property. 
For example, assume your rental property is located in a neighborhood 
where property values are growing at a rate of 5 percent per year. As long as 
your property is kept in good shape (the lawn is mowed, the paint looks new, 
the roof is in good repair), you have every reason to expect property value 
to continue growing by 5 percent yearly. A house on the next block that is 
poorly cared for and not well maintained is not going to keep up with other 
properties in the area. So, as the owner, you have considerable control over 
the investment value of real estate. 
The Magic of Leverage 
Another feature of real estate—and one of the most desirable aspects—is the 
leverage you achieve when you invest. You will probably make only a 10 
percent to 20 percent down payment, in most situations, and finance the 
rest. However, as long as demand is strong for rental units, your tenants pay 
rent. In a properly planned rental situation, the rent should be high enough 
to make your mortgage payment and to cover all other expenses for which 
you are responsible. This includes insurance and taxes and any landlord-paid 
utilities, as well as the unexpected repairs that seem to come up at the worst 
possible times. 
Some financial planners view leverage as the third use of investment 
capital. The first two are equity and debt. Examples of equity are the direct 
ownership of stocks, mutual fund shares, savings accounts, or real estate. 
Examples of debt include putting money in a savings account (which is 
lending your money to the bank), bonds, or income-oriented mutual funds. 
Leverage, as a third use of capital, has a higher degree of risk but more 
potential for profit as well. The market exposure has two sides. Potential 
profit is always accompanied with potential loss, so leverage cannot be 
thought of without also understanding that risk levels change.

[ 235 ]
GROWING VALUE WHILE YOUR LOAN IS PAID 
Assuming that you have planned well and your rental income covers all of 
your payments, the value of your real estate investment will grow over time 
without your having to pay out large sums each month to maintain your 
mortgage. If property values are growing by 5 percent per year in your city, 
you will make a much better profit than you would placing capital in a local 
savings account paying 0.5 percent. In exchange, you accept higher risks. 
However, the cost of your mortgage is paid monthly by your tenant.
Even though the tenant pays your mortgage for you, it is you who are 
taking all of the risks by investing in the property. These risks include 
unexpected major repairs, vacancies, or a decline in real estate market 
values. Every real estate investor lives with these risks constantly. However, 
by leveraging your capital, you can control several properties for very little 
market risk. If you have $100,000 to invest, you could buy a single property 
for $100,000 and enjoy very healthy cash flow, or you could leverage the 
money and put 25 percent down on four different properties—spreading 
your risk. 
KeY Point With leverage, you hope to cover your mortgage with rent 
income and, ultimately, to be able to sell the properties at a profit. The 
more you leverage your capital, the more you increase your personal risk. 
Your Tolerance for Risk 
The idea of risk tolerance has to be kept in mind when you consider highly 
leveraged approaches to real estate. You may be able to locate properties to 
buy for little or no down payment; you may also discover that some owners 
are willing to finance your purchase without having to go to an outside 
lender. In both of these cases, there is probably something about the property 
that you need to understand before finalizing the deal. A no-down-payment 
property is available because the seller knows it is the only way to attract a 
buyer. Seller financing often means that the seller knows a conventional 
lender would never approve a loan. It may be that the foundation does not 
meet minimal standards (post and beam instead of full construction, for 
example) or that some other condition offsets claimed equity in the property. 
In such cases, offering seller financing might be the only way a seller can get 
rid of the property without having to spend thousands of dollars to fix a 
problem. 

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 236 ]
iMPortant Before accepting an offer for no down payment or seller 
financing, you should insist on a complete home inspection and make 
your offer subject to receiving a written report detailing any and all flaws 
with the property. 
Acceptable vs. Too Much Leverage 
Leverage of capital is an advantage because you can make a finite amount 
of capital go further. By controlling more properties, you increase your 
potential overall return. At the same time, the risks rise as well, and this 
inescapable fact cannot be ignored. Your personal risk tolerance ultimately 
determines how much leverage you can stand. Most people who buy their 
own homes understand that living with a long-term mortgage is a form of 
acceptable leverage. But once you begin adding rental properties, the degree 
of exposure may become daunting. If you want to own several rental 
properties, it also means having several mortgages and being “at risk” to a 
greater degree. 
TAX ADVANTAGES OF REAL ESTATE 
A review of cash flow has to be performed on an after-tax basis because the 
tax advantages to owning rental property are significant. The tax advantages 
include the deduction of depreciation, a noncash expense that you calculate 
based on the value of improvements (remember, the land cannot be 
depreciated). The benefit to deducting real estate losses varies depending on 
your overall tax situation and effective tax rate and on whether you pay a 
state income tax as well as federal tax. However, it is possible to find yourself 
in a situation in which you have positive cash flow every month but you are 
still able to report a tax loss and reduce your taxes. 
Those who rent out part of their home or who convert a primary residence 
to a rental property also gain advantages. As a landlord, you can deduct 
insurance, utilities, repairs, and other expenses that you cannot deduct on 
your primary residence. 
If you own rental property and you sell it at a profit, you can defer the tax 
on any gain by going through a like-kind exchange. A like-kind exchange 
allows you to continue investing in properties and upgrading without having 
to pay any tax until years later. For example, you could sell a single-family 
house and replace it with a duplex, and then move up to a small apartment 
complex; you could make a profit on each subsequent sale, but as long as you 

including real estate in Your Portfolio
[ 237 ]
meet the requirements for a like-kind exchange, you can defer the tax for 
many years. 
Tax advantages are substantial for real estate investors, not only in 
year-to-year deductions but also in the ability to defer taxes for many years. 
These advantages should be a part of your cash flow analysis, which should 
always be performed on an after-tax basis. The tax advantages of investment 
real estate are among the more compelling reasons for individuals to become 
investors. As a form of asset allocation, dividing capital among investments 
producing taxable income and others producing tax advantages is a 
worthwhile strategy. The higher your tax bracket, the greater the advantage 
is to writing off real estate losses each year. 
EXAMPLE: Your combined federal and state tax rates are 46 percent. 
Writing off the maximum allowed real estate loss of $25,000 each year 
produces an overall tax reduction of $11,500, or $958 a month. This 
savings can make a big difference in your financial picture. You may 
discover that you have a small pretax negative cash flow but a 
substantial after-tax positive cash flow. 
SUITABILITY TESTING: IS REAL ESTATE 
INVESTMENT FOR YOU? 
With every form of investing, the question of suitability needs to be 
addressed. Does real estate investment suit you? The need for tax deductions, 
long-term growth, security, and other attributes are all important in your 
selection of investments; at the same time, each choice has to be suitable for 
you individually. 
Suitability refers to your knowledge as an investor, as well as to 
considerations of liquidity, financial strength, and personal goals. Tests of 
suitability can be used, either by an outsider or by yourself, to determine 
whether a particular investment is the right choice for you. 
 
Knowledge. You are suitable for an investment if and when you understand 
exactly what risks and rules apply; so if you are a novice, taking high-risk 
positions in options or commodities would be unsuitable for you. By the 
same argument, you would not want to enter into a long-term real estate 
transaction if you did not understand how the market works. If you do not 
know how to assess supply and demand for both housing and rentals, then 
you take tremendous risks by simply assuming that a real estate investment 
EXAMPLE

RENTAL PROPERTY PROFITS
[ 238 ]
makes sense. By knowing your facts ahead of time, you can make more 
informed decisions, and profits will be more likely as well. So as a test of 
suitability, you should understand the market before you commit money 
(this applies to all forms of investing, and not just to real estate). 
 
Liquidity. The need for cash is ever present. It does not mean that you need 
to have a large sum of cash on hand or in a savings account; it does mean, 
however, that you need to be able to put your hands on cash on short 
notice, if the need arises. It makes sense to set up an emergency reserve for 
unexpected expenses or in case you lose your job, for example. With real 
estate, you can get cash out only by selling or refinancing. Real estate is 
not a liquid investment, and illiquid choices are not suitable for you if you 
may need to get back some of the cash in the future.
Liquidity also refers to the ability to quickly sell your interests in the 
market if and when you want to. Stocks are highly liquid because shares 
can be sold at today’s market price with an online trade that takes only 
seconds. To sell real estate, you need to list the property and find a buyer. 
A lengthy closing process could take months. So, as a second test of 
suitability, you need to make sure you understand that you cannot get 
cash out of a real estate investment quickly or easily. 
 
Financial Strength. Perhaps the most important test of suitability is financial 
strength. If your real estate investment is likely to produce negative cash 
flow that you cannot afford, then it is not a suitable investment for you. 
If the solution is to offer a higher down payment or to seek markets with 
better market rents, those are possible solutions, but investing money in a 
property that produces negative cash flow or in a weak market where 
vacancies are possible could be disastrous to your financial health. Real 
estate investors need to be able to survive periods of vacancy or to cover 
unexpected repair expenses that may arise. Therefore, investment real 
estate is suitable only if you can carry potential cash flow through periods 
when rents are not coming in or when expenses exceed the normal 
monthly budget.
Your financial strength is also measured by your credit. If you have an 
excellent credit rating, you will not have any problems financing real 
estate investments—assuming that the numbers work. Lenders apply 
ratios to determine how much you can afford based on your current 
income and debts in order to determine whether you qualify for a loan for 
investment real estate. This naturally limits the number of properties you 
will be able to purchase with financing. The higher your income and the 
more asset value you hold, the easier it will be to finance several investment 
properties. But if your income is relatively low or you have a high level of 
personal debt, it is going to be more difficult to gain approval of a loan 
application. 

including real estate in Your Portfolio
[ 239 ]
 
Personal Goals. Finally, your personal goals have to dictate the decisions 
you make in managing your overall portfolio. For example, if you want 
to invest your money so that you don’t have to worry about it, you 
probably need to pick mutual funds or other managed accounts. Real 
estate demands constant care and attention. Furthermore, to legally claim 
a deduction of a loss, you have to remain an active participant in managing 
your properties. So if you plan to invest money and then travel for half the 
year, real estate will not meet your goals. 
With personal goals in mind, the timing of investments is a secondary test 
of the suitability question. For example, if you plan to invest in real estate 
today to fund a child’s college education, how long will you need to keep the 
properties to make a required profit? How long do you have until those 
tuition bills will need to be paid? Is it a good match? If you estimate that you 
will need ten years for real estate values to rise enough (based on recent 
market trends, for example), that tells you that you need to commit capital 
for the next decade. However, if your child will be going to college in five 
years, then real estate is not suitable. 
MAKING THE DECISION  
TO INVEST IN REAL ESTATE 
Including real estate in your portfolio is a big step. Most people are content 
with a fairly standard portfolio—a savings account, an IRA and other 
retirement savings, mutual fund shares, and perhaps a few individually 
owned stocks. If the typical investor is also buying the family home with a 
thirty-year mortgage, this collectively represents a well-diversified portfolio. 
Why expand beyond this and add investment real estate? One major reason 
has to do with today’s perceptions of the stock market. The market appears 
to be at higher risk than it did a few years ago, and many previously dedicated 
stockholders want to have more direct control over their investment capital. 
This disillusionment with the traditional markets is transitional, and as the 
market trend changes, so will attitudes toward placing money at risk in 
stocks. Even so, there will always be investors who are attracted to the direct 
control of real estate. 
Direct control, insurance of your asset, tax benefits, and historical market 
trends—all these factors, in combination, make real estate one of the best 
investments available. The tax and record-keeping requirements are complex, 
and you probably will need professional help to make sure you are keeping 
records correctly. But with that out of the way, you face the potential for 
strong profits over many years.

Real estate is a market worth taking a look at—whether or not you decide 
that it is for you. If you study the market and understand the risks and 
rewards before you commit capital, you could become one of the thousands 
of investors who have found an alternative that improves overall investment 
return while generating current income from an asset that increases in value 
over time.

basis (1) The value of a real estate investment, calculated by adjusting the cost 
for closing costs, depreciation, and deferred profit from other investments; 
(2) the dollar value of property that is subject to depreciation, consisting of 
the cost of all improvements but without including the value of land. 
buyer’s market The condition of the real estate market in which buyers have the

expenses. 
depreciation An expense calculated to allow deductions of real estate 
improvements over a period of years. Residential real estate is depreciated 
over 27.5 years, and assets used to manage investment real estate are 
depreciated over shortened recovery periods. Depreciation is a noncash 
expense and is deductible on the investor’s federal tax return.

midmonth convention A method of calculating first-year depreciation for real 
estate, in which depreciation is based on the assumption that the asset was 
acquired halfway through the month that the asset was placed in service. 
modified adjusted gross income For the purpose of calculating allowable 
deduction of losses from real estate, modified AGI is the value of adjusted 
gross income without certain deductions. If modified AGI is above $100,000, 
deduction limits on real estate losses are reduced. 
negative cash flow An undesirable situation in which more money is paid out 
each month than is being received. Negative cash flow may occur if the 
property is vacant, or if tenants do not pay rent, or if mortgage and other 
payments exceed the level of income that can be reasonably expected from 
an investment. 
occupancy or vacancy rate The calculation of average periods of time a property 
is either occupied or vacant, usually expressed in the form of a percentage. If 
a property is occupied eleven out of twelve months, it has a 91.7 percent 
occupancy rate (or an 8.3 percent vacancy rate). 
passive activity An investment activity in which the investor is not involved 
directly. As such, losses from passive activity cannot be deducted but must be 
applied against other passive activity gains. An exception to this rule is real 
estate, where up to $25,000 per year can be deducted as long as the investor 
is an active participant and has at least 10 percent ownership of the property. 
payments journal Another name for the bookkeeping record or the disbursements 
journal.

receipts journal A record used to record rent income and other receipts in the 
bookkeeping system. 
recovery period In calculation of depreciation, the period of time that assets are 
to be depreciated. Most residential real estate is depreciated over 27.5 years, 
for example. Other assets used as part of the investment activity (e.g., 
automobiles or computers) belong in the five-year recovery period. 
second mortgage A mortgage in second place of priority in the event of default. 
A first lien holder is paid before the second lien holder in the event of 
foreclosure. 
seller financing Condition in which a seller offers to carry all or part of a loan

SAMPLE CHAPTER FROM MONEY MACHINE
Investing in the market doesn’t have to be reckless speculation—gambling 
on guesses about zigs and zags in stock prices. Money Machine explains 
how to invest based on value, selecting stocks that will continue to enrich 
you for years to come. Value investing is the secret to the success of Warren 
Buffet, Benjamin Graham, and other Wall Street legends. It can be your 
secret, too.

INTRODUCTION
The stock market is filled with individuals who know the price of 
 everything, but the value of nothing.
—PhiliP Fisher
I 
made it through Yale graduate school on a $200 monthly sti-
pend—$100 for rent in a nasty part of New Haven and $100 for 
food, secondhand clothes, and not much else. My shoes were held 
together with duct tape, and dinners at the end of the month were 
often bread and orange juice, sometimes bread and water. I started 
teaching economics at Yale in 1971, a newly minted PhD with a 
three-month-old son, $12,000 annual income, and less than $100 in 
the bank.
The Yale economics department asked students what courses 
they would like added to the curriculum and the runaway winners 
were Marx and the stock market. I wasn’t interested in Marx, but 
the chair of my thesis committee was James Tobin, who would be 
awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics, in part for his analysis of fi-
nancial markets. So, I volunteered to create a stock market course 
and asked Jim to recommend a textbook. His immediate answer was 
The Theory of Investment Value, by John Burr Williams, which had 
been published more than thirty years earlier, in 1938, and was not 
really a textbook. It was Williams’s PhD thesis and had been re-
jected by several publishers for being overly academic (it had alge-
braic symbols!). Harvard University Press published it, but Williams 
had to pay part of the printing cost himself.
Tobin’s recommendation was inspired. John Burr Williams and 
Benjamin Graham laid the foundation for value investing— assessing 
stocks based on the cash they generate rather than trying to  predict 

SAMPLE CHAPTER OF MONEY MACHINE
[ 254 ]
zigs and zags in stock prices. Their way of thinking is central to the 
success of many legendary value investors, including Warren Buffett, 
Laurence Tisch, and Michael Larson.
I didn’t use Williams’s treatise as a textbook but, over and over, I 
have relied on the insights I learned from Tobin, Williams, Graham, 
and Buffett. I’ve been investing and teaching investing for more 
than forty years now, and I’ve learned that some lessons are well 
worth learning, others are not. Their lessons are worth learning.
Financial markets are always changing, but underneath these in-
novations are some core concepts like present value, leverage, 
hedging, efficient markets, and the conservation of value. These 
enduring principles are more important than temporary details. 
 Investing is not a multiple-choice test that can be passed by mem-
orizing soon-obsolete facts like the name of the largest brokerage 
firm or the number of stocks traded on the New York Stock 
 Exchange.
The great British economist John Maynard Keynes wrote:
The master-economist must possess a rare combination of 
gifts. He must be mathematician, historian, statesman, phi-
losopher—in some degree. He must understand symbols 
and speak in words. He must contemplate the particular in 
terms of the general, and touch abstract and concrete in the 
same flight of thought. He must study the present in the 
light of the past for the purposes of the future. No part of 
man’s nature or his institutions must lie entirely outside his 
regard.
The same could be said of the master investor. How can we calculate 
present values without mathematics? How can we gauge uncertainty 
without statistics? However, a deep understanding of investments 
requires recognition of the limitations of mathematical and statisti-
cal models, no matter how scientific they appear, no matter if they 
were developed by Nobel laureates.
Tobin came to Yale in 1950 when the economics department de-

SAMPLE CHAPTER OF MONEY MACHINE
[ 255 ]
cided that it needed a mathematical economist. Yes, one mathemat-
ical economist among a faculty of perhaps sixty. When Tobin retired, 
every Yale economist was more mathematical than Tobin had been 
in 1950, some frighteningly so. Mathematicians had become the 
gods of economics, and knowing nothing about the real world was 
almost a badge of honor. When Gérard Debreu was awarded the 
Nobel Prize in Economics in 1983, reporters tried to get him to say 
something about Ronald Reagan’s economic policies. Debreu firmly 
refused to say anything, some suspected because he didn’t know or 
care—and was proud of it.
Mathematical models are too often revered more for their ele-
gance than their realism. Too many economists assume whatever is 
needed—no matter how preposterous—in order to make their mod-
els mathematically tractable. I listened to a finance lecture at Yale 
where a future Nobel laureate began his talk with a brutally candid 
statement: “Making whatever assumptions are needed, here is my 
proof.”
This cavalier attitude may work great for publishing academic 
papers that no one reads, but it is a recipe for disaster on Wall Street 
where real people risk real money and may literally be betting the 
bank based on a model concocted out of convenience.
At about the same time I heard this lecture, the New Statesman 
gave an award for this definition of an economist:
An inhabitant of cloud-cuckoo land; one knowledgeable in 
an obsolete art; a harmless academic drudge whose theories 
and laws are but mere puffs of air in face of the anarchy of 
banditry, greed, and corruption which holds sway in the pe-
cuniary affairs of the real world.
In recent years, the inhabitants of cloud-cuckoo land have been 
joined on the economics pedestal by new gods: number crunchers.
When I first started teaching investments, computers were just 
becoming popular, and my wife’s grandfather (“Popsie”) knew that 
my PhD thesis used Yale’s big computer to estimate an extremely 

SAMPLE CHAPTER OF MONEY MACHINE
[ 256 ]
complicated economic model. Popsie had bought and sold stocks 
for decades. He even had his own desk at his broker’s office where 
he could trade gossip and stocks.
Nonetheless, he wanted advice from a twenty-one-year-old kid 
who had no money and had never bought a single share of stock in 
his life—me—because I worked with computers. “Ask the computer 
what it thinks of Schlumberger,” he’d say. “Ask the computer what it 
thinks of GE.”
Things haven’t changed much. Too many people still think that 
computers are infallible. No matter what kind of garbage we put in, 
computers will spit out gospel. Nope. Garbage in, garbage out. As 
with theoretical models based on convenient assumptions, statisti-
cal patterns uncovered by torturing data are worse than worthless. 
They have bankrupted investors large and small.
Mathematics is not enough. Statistics is not enough. Master in-
vestors need common sense; they need to understand human na-
ture, and they need to control their emotions.
FEAR AND GREED
I have a friend, Blake, who netted a million dollars in cash when he 
downsized by selling a McMansion and buying a smaller home. 
About a year after the sale, I asked him what he had done with the 
money and I was flabbergasted when he told me that he had been 
holding it in his checking account. He didn’t know what the interest 
rate was, so I checked. It was 0.01 percent. That’s right, one one-
hundredths of a percent.
I asked why and Blake said he didn’t want to lose any money. True 
enough, his money wasn’t going to go below $1 million, but it wasn’t 
going to go much above $1 million, either. He was losing a lot of 
money compared to how much money he might have if he invested 
in stocks. A return of 0.01 percent on $1 million is $100 in a year’s 
time. A portfolio of blue-chip stocks with 2 percent dividend yields 

SAMPLE CHAPTER OF MONEY MACHINE
[ 257 ]
would generate $20,000 in dividends in a year’s time. There is a 
pretty big difference between $100 and $20,000.
It gets worse. With normal 5 percent dividend growth, the antic-
ipated long-return from the blue-chip stock portfolio is 7 percent. If 
dividends and prices go up by 5 percent the first year, the first-year 
return is $70,000, compared to $100. That’s a heavy price to pay for 
safety.
It is true, as Blake said adamantly, there is no guarantee what 
stock prices will be day to day, week to week, or year to year. Stock 
prices could drop 5, 10, even 20 percent in a single day, even more in 
a year.
I tried to convince Blake of the wisdom of a value-investor per-
spective. Invest in ten, twenty, or thirty great companies with 2 per-
cent dividend yields and then forget about it. Don’t check stock 
prices every day. He could think about something else—his family, 
his job, his hobbies. While he is minding his own business, his stock 
portfolio will pay $20,000 dividends the first year, somewhat more 
the next year, and even more the year after that, with all dividends 
automatically reinvested.
Ten years from now, he can check his portfolio. He will have ac-
cumulated ten years of healthy dividends reinvested to earn even 
more dividends. The market prices of his stocks will almost surely 
be higher ten years from now than they are today, probably much 
higher. The economy will be much larger, corporate earnings will be 
much higher, and dividends will be much higher—so will stock 
prices. If the dividends and earnings on his stocks grow by an aver-
age of 5 percent a year and price-earnings ratios are about the same 
then as they are today, his portfolio will be worth about $2 million, 
as opposed to $1,001,000 if he leaves his money in a checking ac-
count paying 0.01 percent interest for ten years
Blake reluctantly agreed to invest $500,000 in stocks. Wouldn’t 
you know it, he called me the next day to complain that the value of 
his portfolio had dropped by $195. (No, I am not making this up.) 
He wanted to sell his stocks before he lost any more money.

SAMPLE CHAPTER OF MONEY MACHINE
[ 258 ]
Other people are the exact opposite. I have another friend, 
Emma, who gets the same thrills from buying and selling stocks that 
other people get from winning and losing money in Las Vegas. Every 
weekday morning, Emma bolts out of bed, excited to start a new day 
filled with buying and selling stocks. News tidbits, stock price blips, 
and chat-room rumors provide jolts of excitement as Emma moves 
quickly to buy or sell before others do. By the end of the day, she has 
sold everything she bought during the day because she doesn’t want 
to be blindsided by overnight news. Emma wants to be in control, to 
begin every day with cash that she can deploy during the day as she 
does battle with other investors.
On weekends, Emma is bored and restless. For some people, 
Monday is Blue Monday—the day they have to go back to work. For 
Emma, Monday is Merry Monday—the day she gets to start living 
again.
Emma is a gambling addict. Some people love to watch slot- 
machine wheels spin; Emma loves to watch stock prices dance. Prof-
its are exhilarating. Losses are an incentive to keep betting, hoping 
to recoup those losses and believing that she is due for a win. Day- 
trading stocks is entertainment, but it is not cheap.
I hope this book will convince you that Blake and Emma are bad 
role models. Sensible investors can make a lot more money than 
Blake’s checking account without taking as many risks as Emma’s 
dice rolls. The secret is value investing—buying solid stocks at at-
tractive prices, and leaving them alone.
Value investing is admittedly more adventurous than checking 
accounts and more boring than day-trading, but it is more rewarding 
than both.
Part I of this book will argue that a value-investing strategy can 
help intelligent investors select profitable investments without un-
bearable financial stress. Part II will describe several detailed exam-
ples of value investing.
