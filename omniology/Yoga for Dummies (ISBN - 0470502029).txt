Knoll who are both talented and compassionate.

Introduction
M
ore than 15 million Americans practice Yoga of one kind or another, 
and many more millions of Yoga practitioners live in other parts of 
the world. Yoga isn’t a fad. It has been around in the West for well over a hun-
dred years and has a history of approximately five millennia. It’s clearly here 
to stay, so don’t worry that you’re investing yourself in some flash-in-the-pan 
phenomenon that will disappear six months from now.
Yoga may be 5,000 years old, but the modern Yoga boom didn’t start until 
the 1960s, largely thanks to Richard Hittleman’s extraordinarily success-
ful TV series Yoga for Health. This show was followed in the 1970s by Lilias 
Folan’s TV series Lilias, Yoga and You. This era also brought the rise of 
Transcendental Meditation (TM) — a form of Yoga — largely because of 
the Beatles’ interest in it. TM attracted hundreds of thousands who were in 
search of stress reduction and a more meaningful life.
Yoga has brought health and peace of mind to millions of people, and it can 
do the same for you. We challenge you to explore Yoga in depth, with Yoga 
For Dummies, 2nd Edition, as your guide. The yogic postures are an excellent 
starting point, but they’re merely the outermost shell of a multilayered tradi-
tion. At its core, Yoga is a timeless answer for those who quest for a deeper 
meaning in life and for that elusive treasure called abiding peacefulness.
About This Book
Perhaps Yoga For Dummies, 2nd Edition, is the first book on Yoga you’ve ever 
held in your hands. In this case, we can confidently say that you’re starting 
at the right place. More likely, however, you have leafed through quite a few 
other books (there is definitely no shortage of publications dealing with Yoga 
exercises). Not all of those publications are either sound or helpful. Why, then, 
should you take this book seriously? We have a two-part answer for you.
First, the information you find in Yoga For Dummies, 2nd Edition, is based 
on our extensive study and practice of Yoga. Between us, we have 75 years 
of experience with Yoga. One author (Georg) is internationally recognized 
as a leading expert on the Yoga tradition and has authored many seminal 
works on it (some of which we list in the appendix) and has created a teacher 
training manual on Yoga philosophy used by many Yoga teachers in seven 
countries. The other author (Larry) directs a university-based Yoga therapy 
training program for Yoga teachers at Loyola Marymount University; has a 
thriving practice as a Yoga teacher and Yoga therapist in Los Angeles, where 

2
Yoga For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
he teaches and responds to his clients’ specific health challenges, notably 
back problems; and has produced a popular series of Yoga DVDs (also listed 
in the appendix). In this book, we merge our respective areas of expertise to 
create a reliable and user-friendly introductory book that can also serve you 
as a beginner’s reference work on an ongoing basis.
Second, we’re both dedicated to motivating you to practice this system, 
which we have seen work minor and major miracles. We have committed 
our lives to making Yoga available to anyone who cares about the health and 
wholeness of the body and mind. In short (and without feeling self-important), 
we can say that you’re in the best of hands.
This book guides you slowly, step by step, into the treasure house of Yoga. 
And it’s a fabulous treasure house! You find out how to strengthen your mind 
and enlist it to unlock your body’s extraordinary potential. A sound body 
requires a sound mind, and we show you how to improve or regain the health 
and wholeness of both.
Whether you’re interested in becoming more flexible, fitter, less stressed 
out, or more peaceful and joyful, this book contains all the good counsel and 
practical exercises to start you in the right direction.
Above all, we have endeavored to make this book relevant to busy people like 
you. And if, after reading this guide, you become more serious about studying 
and practicing Yoga, consider taking a Yoga class with a qualified instructor. 
This book is a great guide, but nothing compares to hands-on teaching.
Conventions Used in This Book
To help you work your way through this book, we’ve set up a few conventions:
 
✓ Boldfaced text emphasizes keywords in bulleted lists and identifies 
steps to take in numbered lists.
 
✓ New terms are italicized and followed closely by a definition.
 
✓ URLs appear in monofont.
 
✓ In English, you customarily write yoga in lower-case letters. However, 
throughout this book, we write the word with an initial capital letter — 
Yoga — to emphasize that Yoga is a self-contained system or tradition, 
like Zen, Hinduism, or Buddhism. The adjective of Yoga is yogic, which 
you encounter frequently in this book.
 
✓ A person who’s dedicated to balancing mind and body through Yoga is 
traditionally called a yogi (if male) or a yogini (if female), and we use both 
terms. Alternatively, we also use the English term Yoga practitioner.

3
 Introduction
 
✓ Although we give you some basic info on all branches of Yoga, the focus 
of this book is on Hatha (pronounced haht-ha) Yoga, which is the branch 
that works primarily with the body through postures, breathing exer-
cises, and other similar techniques.
 
✓ We use the words pose and posture interchangeably, although we use 
posture in the names of specific postures.
A final note: For your safety, be sure to read all the instructions when getting 
ready to practice the exercises. Don’t just glance at the illustrations and think 
you can leap right in. Although the illustrations are very helpful tools, they 
don’t give you the whole story needed to practice safe and effective Yoga.
What You’re Not to Read
We must admit that we hope you read every word in this book at some 
point in your yogic journey. We also confess that we include a few tidbits 
just to get your mind going and make you think. We mark this text with the 
Technical Stuff icon or format it as a sidebar (shaded gray box). These tidbits 
are interesting and important in their own right, but they’re not essential to 
your practice of the various postures. Feel free to skip ’em, but plan to go 
back and read them at some point. You’ll be glad you did!
Foolish Assumptions
We’re not here to judge, but we have made some general assumptions about 
you, the reader. First, we assume that you’re interested in reaping some ben-
efits from practicing Yoga. Second, we assume that you don’t have much (if 
any) experience with Yoga. Finally, we assume that you’re curious and willing 
to find out more. That’s it. Nothing fancy. If you fall into any of these catego-
ries, Yoga For Dummies, 2nd Edition, is for you!
How This Book Is Organized
This book is organized according to the characteristic design of all For 
Dummies books. It answers all the important questions you need to know for 
a successful practice of Yoga.
Yoga For Dummies is conveniently divided into five parts. Here is what you 
can expect to encounter in them:

4
Yoga For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
Part I: Off to a Good Start with Yoga
This opening part sets the stage for the discussions and practices that follow 
and covers some of the fundamentals you need to know before beginning 
with the postures. In Chapter 1, we explain what Yoga is and clear up some 
widespread misunderstandings about it. We also introduce the five basic 
approaches to and twelve principal branches of Yoga and review how these 
relate to your health and happiness. In Chapter 2, we provide you with 
down-to-earth practical advice on getting started with your own Yoga prac-
tice, showing you how you can make it both safe and effective. In particular, 
we answer all your questions about participating in a class or practicing on 
your own. Chapter 3 covers everything you need to do to prepare for a Yoga 
session, including cultivating the right state of mind. Chapter 4 introduces 
the art of relaxation, which is fundamental to a successful Yoga practice. In 
Chapter 5, we explain the importance of correct breathing both during the 
execution of the Yoga postures and as a discipline in its own right.
Part II: Postures for Health Maintenance 
and Restoration
In the second part, we jump straight into the Yoga postures. In Chapters 6 
through 13, you successively discover sitting postures, standing postures, 
balancing exercises, special practices for your abdominals, inversions, 
bends, and twists, as well as the popular dynamic movement called the Sun 
Salutation. In Chapter 14, we guide you through a short, time-tested routine 
designed for beginners.
Part III: Creative Yoga
Chapter 15 helps you spice it up and gives you the key formula to design well-
rounded routines of varying lengths, as well as guidelines to ensure your prac-
tice is safe as well as enjoyable. In Chapters 16, 17, and 18, we delve into Yoga for 
different ages and stages — pregnancy through the senior years — and provide 
guidelines, suggest postures, and outline routines so that all potential yogis and 
yoginis can find their niches. Chapter 19 discusses the use of props and reviews 
simple props, such as walls, chairs, straps, and blocks, to facilitate your posture 
practice.

5
 Introduction
Part IV: Yoga as a Lifestyle
When you adopt Yoga as a lifestyle, your practice extends over the entire 
day. In this part, we explain how to make this shift and why this choice 
makes sense. As we show in Chapter 20, Yoga has much to say about posi-
tive mental attitudes toward work, leisure, diet, family, and other people. 
In Chapter 21, we introduce you to the art of meditation. If the postures 
are Yoga’s backbone, meditation is its heart. Regular meditation puts you 
in touch with the joy and peace that is your mind’s natural condition. 
Chapter 22 looks at using Yoga therapeutically to deal with common aches 
and pains and illustrates safe postures to relieve back pain. It also offers 
a five-step program to help you prevent chronic back pain so that you can 
continue, not curtail, your lifestyle. We also discuss how to find a good 
Yoga therapist.
Part V: The Part of Tens
All For Dummies books have a Part of Tens section, and this one is no differ-
ent. Here we give you top-ten lists that provide you with useful and practical 
information. In Chapter 23, we let you in on important hints for a successful 
and enjoyable Yoga practice with a focus on relaxation, and Chapter 24 
tells you the best places to visit in the United States and Canada if you’re 
interested in practicing Yoga with a competent teacher and/or in a group 
setting. Finally, in Chapter 25, we list ten good reasons for practicing 
Yoga.
We encourage you to explore Yoga further, so the appendix at the end of the 
book gives you the necessary resources to do just that. We cover prominent 
organizations and list some of the best Web sites, books, DVDs, audiotapes, 
and videos on the various aspects of Yoga.
Icons Used in This Book
Throughout this book, you may notice little pictures in the margins. You can 
use these icons as helpful pointers to information you don’t want to forget 
(or, in some cases, don’t want to read at all).

Following is the list of icons used in this book:
 
This icon points you toward helpful information that can make your yogic 
journey a little smoother.
 
Be sure to check out the information marked by this icon; it points out poten-
tial dangers you want to avoid.
 
This icon marks nerdy technical stuff that’s interesting to know but probably 
not necessary to your understanding of Yoga. But you may be able to impress 
your friends at your next dinner party.
 
The paragraphs sitting next to this baby are pretty noteworthy. You may want 
to jot them down somewhere or circle them in the book for later reference.
Where to Go from Here
We’ve designed Yoga For Dummies, 2nd Edition, to be both an introduc-
tion and a beginner’s reference work. You can read the chapters one after 
the other and practice along with us, or you can dip into the book here and 
there, reading up on the things that currently interest you, such as how to 
find the right kind of style or Yoga class for your needs, or what helpful props 
you can use to make your practice easier.
If you’re a newcomer to Yoga, we recommend that you spend some time with 
the table of contents. You may even want to leaf through the book to get a 
general sense of how we have structured and approached the material.
If you aren’t new to Yoga and simply want a refresher course, you can also 
use this book as a reliable guide in answering your questions. Just flip to the 
index to locate the information you need or check out the appendix, which 
refers you to a variety of sources of information on specific topics relating to 
Yoga. What are you waiting for? Dig in!

Part I
Off to a Good Start 
with Yoga

In this part . . .
Yoga is very comprehensive and includes a great vari-
ety of approaches. Before you go off hiking in the 
countryside, you need to take a quick look at the map or 
risk getting lost. Likewise, before you start experimenting 
with Yoga, you want to know what it is and how it works. 
That’s how you can ensure that your practice of Yoga is 
both enjoyable and safe.
In this first part, we give you a road map that allows you 
to take the first steps in what will be an exciting and 
rewarding journey of discovery. We cover some of the fun-
damentals that can serve you well as you embark upon 
your practice of Yoga postures: guidelines for a safe prac-
tice, conscious breathing and relaxation techniques, and 
coordination of breath and movement.

Chapter 1
Yoga 101: What You 
Need to Know
In This Chapter
▶ Debunking Yoga myths
▶ Deciphering the word Yoga
▶ Exploring the primary branches, styles, and approaches to Yoga
▶ Understanding the yogic principles of being
▶ Taking control of your mind, body, health, and life with Yoga
T
hree or four decades ago, some people still occasionally confused Yoga 
with yogurt. Today, Yoga is a household word. The fact that just about 
everyone has heard the word Yoga, however, doesn’t mean they know 
exactly what it means. Many misconceptions still exist, even among those 
who practice Yoga, so in this chapter, we clear up the confusion and explain 
what Yoga really is and how it relates to your health and happiness. We also 
help you see that Yoga, with its many different branches and approaches, 
really does offer something for everyone.
Whatever your age, weight, flexibility, or beliefs may be, you can practice and 
benefit from some version of Yoga. Although Yoga originated in India, it’s for 
all of humanity.
Understanding the True 
Character of Yoga
Whenever you hear that Yoga is just this or just that, your nonsense alert 
should kick into action. Yoga is too comprehensive to reduce to any one 
thing — it’s like a skyscraper with many floors and numerous rooms at each 

10
Part I: Off to a Good Start with Yoga 
level. Yoga isn’t just gymnastics, fitness training, huffing and puffing, or a way 
to control your weight. It’s not just stress reduction, meditation, or some 
spiritual tradition from India.
Yoga is all these things and a great deal more. (You’d expect as much from 
a tradition that’s been around for 5,000 years.) Yoga includes physical 
exercises that look like gymnastics and have even been incorporated into 
Western gymnastics. These postural exercises help you become or stay fit 
and trim, control your weight, and reduce your stress level. Yoga also offers 
a whole range of meditation practices, including breathing techniques that 
exercise your lungs and calm your nervous system or charge your brain and 
the rest of your body with delicious energy.
You can also use Yoga as an efficient system of health care that has proven 
its usefulness in both restoring and maintaining health. Yoga continues to 
gain acceptance within the medical establishment; more and more physicians 
are recommending Yoga to their patients not only for stress reduction but 
also as a safe and sane method of exercise and physical therapy (notably, for 
the back and knees).
But Yoga is more than even a system of preventative or restorative health 
care. Yoga looks at health from a broad, holistic perspective that’s only now 
being rediscovered by avant-garde medicine. This perspective appreciates 
the enormous influence of the mind — your psychological attitudes — on 
physical health.
Finding unity
The word Yoga comes from the ancient Sanskrit language spoken by the 
traditional religious elite of India, the Brahmins. Yoga means “union” or 
“integration” and also “discipline,” so the system of Yoga is called a unitive 
or integrating discipline. Yoga seeks unity at various levels. First, it seeks to 
unite body and mind, which people all too often separate. Some people are 
chronically “out of the body.” They can’t feel their feet or the ground beneath 
them, as if they hover like ghosts just above their bodies. They’re unable to 
cope with the ordinary pressures of daily life and collapse under stress, and 
they’re often confused and don’t understand their own emotions. They’re 
afraid of life and easily emotionally hurt.
Yoga also seeks to unite the rational mind and the emotions. People frequently 
bottle up their emotions and don’t express their real feelings, choosing instead 
to rationalize these feelings away. Chronic avoidance can become a serious 
health hazard; if people aren’t aware that they’re suppressing feelings such as 
anger, the anger consumes them from the inside out.

11
 Chapter 1: Yoga 101: What You Need to Know
 
Here’s how Yoga can help you with your personal growth:
 
✓ It can put you in touch with your real feelings and balance your emo-
tional life.
 
✓ It can help you understand and accept yourself and feel comfortable 
with who you are. You don’t have to “fake it” or reduce your life to con-
stant role-playing.
 
✓ It helps you become more able to empathize and communicate with 
others.
Yoga is a powerful means of psychological integration. It makes you aware 
that you’re part of a larger whole, not merely an island unto yourself. Humans 
can’t thrive in isolation. Even the most independent individual is greatly 
indebted to others. After your mind and body are happily reunited, this 
union with others comes about naturally. The moral principles of Yoga are 
all-embracing, encouraging you to seek kinship with everyone and every-
thing. We say more about this topic in Chapter 20.
Finding yourself: Are you 
a yogi (or yogini)?
Someone who’s practicing the discipline of balancing mind and body through 
Yoga is traditionally called a yogi (if male) or a yogini (if female). In this book, 
we use both terms at random. Alternatively, we also use the English term 
Yoga practitioner. In our book, practicing Yoga postures is a step in the right 
direction but doesn’t make a person a yogi or yogini. For that, you’d have to 
embrace Yoga as a self-transforming spiritual discipline. A yogi or yogini who 
has really mastered Yoga is called an adept. If such an adept also teaches 
(and not all of them do), he or she is traditionally called a guru. The Sanskrit 
word guru means literally “weighty one.” According to traditional esoteric 
sources, the syllable gu signifies spiritual darkness and ru signifies the act of 
removing. Thus a guru is a teacher who leads the student from darkness to 
light.
Very few Westerners have achieved complete mastery of Yoga, mainly 
because Yoga is still a relatively young movement in the West. So please 
be careful about those who claim to be enlightened or to have been given 
the title of guru! However, at the level at which Yoga is generally taught 
outside its Indian homeland, many competent Yoga teachers or instructors 
can lend a helping hand to beginners. In this book, we hope to do just that 
for you.

12
Part I: Off to a Good Start with Yoga 
Considering Your Options: The Eight 
Main Branches of Yoga
When you take a bird’s-eye view of the Yoga tradition, you see a dozen major 
strands of development, each with its own subdivisions. Picture Yoga as a 
giant tree with eight branches; each branch has its own unique character, but 
each is also part of the same tree. With so many different paths, you’re sure 
to find one that’s right for your personality, lifestyle, and goals. In this book 
we focus on Hatha Yoga, the most popular branch of Yoga, but we avoid the 
common mistake of reducing it to mere physical fitness training. Thus, we 
also talk about meditation and the spiritual aspects of Yoga.
Here are the seven principal branches of Yoga, arranged alphabetically:
 
✓ Bhakti (bhuk-tee) Yoga: The Yoga of devotion
 
✓ Hatha (haht-ha) Yoga: The Yoga of physical discipline
 
✓ Jnana (gyah-nah) Yoga: The Yoga of wisdom
 
✓ Karma (kahr-mah) Yoga: The Yoga of self-transcending action
 
✓ Mantra (mahn-trah) Yoga: The Yoga of potent sound
 
✓ Raja (rah-jah) Yoga: The Royal Yoga
 
✓ Tantra (tahn-trah) Yoga (including Laya Yoga and Kundalini Yoga): 
The Yoga of continuity
To this list we must add as a branch of its own Guru (goo-roo) Yoga, the Yoga 
of dedication to a Yoga master.
The seven branches and Guru Yoga are described in the following sections.
Feeling enlightened
To get a sense of the nature of enlightenment, 
sit in a warm room as still as possible, with your 
hands in your lap. Now sense your skin all over; 
it’s your body’s boundary separating you from 
the air surrounding you. As you become more 
aware of your body’s sensations, pay special 
attention to the connection between your skin 
and the air. After a while, you realize that no 
sharp boundary really exists between your skin 
and the outside air. In your imagination, you 
can extend yourself further and further beyond 
your skin into the surrounding space. Where 
do you end, and where does the space begin? 
This experience can give you a sense of the 
all-comprising expansiveness of enlightenment, 
which knows no boundaries.

13
 Chapter 1: Yoga 101: What You Need to Know
Bhakti Yoga: The Yoga of devotion
Bhakti Yoga practitioners believe that a supreme being (the Divine) transcends 
their lives, and they feel moved to connect or even completely merge with that 
supreme being through acts of devotion. Bhakti Yoga includes such practices 
as making flower offerings, singing hymns of praise, and thinking about the 
Divine.
Hatha Yoga: The Yoga 
of physical discipline
All branches of Yoga seek to achieve the same final goal, enlightenment (see 
Chapter 21), but Hatha Yoga approaches this goal through the body rather 
than through the mind or the emotions. Hatha Yoga practitioners believe 
that unless they properly purify and prepare their bodies, the higher stages 
of meditation and beyond are virtually impossible to achieve — such an 
attempt would be like trying to climb Mt. Everest without the necessary gear. 
We focus on this particular branch of Yoga in this book.
 
Hatha Yoga is very much more than posture practice, which is so popular 
today. Like every form of authentic Yoga, it’s a spiritual path.
Jnana Yoga: The Yoga of wisdom
Jnana Yoga teaches the ideal of nondualism — that reality is singular, and 
your perception of countless distinct phenomena is a basic misconception. 
What about the chair or sofa that you’re sitting on? Isn’t that real? What 
about the light that strikes your retina? Isn’t that real? Jnana Yoga masters 
answer these questions by saying that all these things are real at your pres-
ent level of consciousness, but they aren’t ultimately real as separate or dis-
tinct things. Upon enlightenment, everything melts into one, and you become 
one with the immortal spirit.
Karma Yoga: The Yoga of 
self-transcending action
Karma Yoga’s most important principle is to act unselfishly, without attach-
ment, and with integrity. Karma Yoga practitioners believe that all actions, 
whether bodily, vocal, or mental, have far-reaching consequences for which 
they must assume full responsibility.

14
Part I: Off to a Good Start with Yoga 
Mantra Yoga: The Yoga of potent sound
Mantra Yoga makes use of sound to harmonize the body and focus the mind. 
It works with mantras, which can be a syllable, word, or phrase. Traditionally, 
practitioners receive a mantra from their teacher in the context of a formal 
initiation. They’re asked to repeat it as often as possible and to keep it secret. 
Many Western teachers feel that initiation isn’t necessary and that any sound 
works. You can even pick a word from the dictionary, such as love, peace, or 
happiness, but from a traditional perspective, such words are, strictly speak-
ing, not mantras.
Raja Yoga: The Royal Yoga
Raja Yoga means literally “Royal Yoga” and is also known as Classical Yoga. 
When you mingle with Yoga students long enough, you can expect to hear 
them refer to the eightfold path laid down in the Yoga-Sutra of Patanjali, the 
standard work of Raja Yoga. Another name for this yogic tradition is Ashtanga 
Yoga (pronounced ahsh-tahng-gah), the “eight-limbed Yoga” — from ashta 
(“eight”) and anga (“limb”). (Don’t confuse this tradition with the Yoga style 
known as Ashtanga Yoga, which we discuss in “Getting The Scoop on the 
Prominent Styles of Hatha Yoga” later in this chapter.) The eight limbs of the 
prominent traditional approach, designed to lead to enlightenment or libera-
tion, are as follows:
 
✓ Yama (yah-mah): Moral discipline, consisting of the practices of non-
harming, truthfulness, nonstealing, chastity, and greedlessness (for an 
explanation of these five virtues, head to Chapter 20).
 
✓ Niyama (nee-yah-mah): Self-restraint, consisting of the five practices 
of purity, contentment, austerity, self-study, and devotion to a higher 
principle.
Good karma, bad karma, no karma
The Sanskrit term karma literally means 
“action.” It stands for activity in general 
but also for the “invisible action” of destiny. 
According to Yoga, every action of body, 
speech, and mind produces visible and also 
hidden consequences. Sometimes the hidden 
consequences — destiny — are far more sig-
nificant than the obvious repercussions. Don’t 
think of karma as blind destiny. You’re always 
free to make choices. The purpose of Karma 
Yoga is to regulate how you act in the world 
so that you cease to be bound by karma. The 
practitioners of all types of Yoga seek to not 
only prevent bad (black) karma but also go 
beyond good (white) karma to no karma at all.

 Chapter 1: Yoga 101: What You Need to Know
 
✓ Asana (ah-sah-nah): Posture, which serves two basic purposes: medita-
tion and health.
 
✓ Pranayama (prah-nah-yah-mah): Breath control, which raises and 
balances your mental energy, thus boosting your health and mental 
concentration.
 
✓ Pratyahara (prah-tyah-hah-rah): Sensory inhibition, which internal-
izes your consciousness to prepare your mind for the various stages of 
meditation.
 
✓ Dharana (dhah-rah-nah): Concentration, or extended mental focusing, 
which is fundamental to yogic meditation.
 
✓ Dhyana (dhee-yah-nah): Meditation, the principal practice of higher 
Yoga (this practice and the next are explained in Chapter 21).
 
✓ Samadhi (sah-mah-dhee): Ecstasy, or the experience in which you 
become inwardly one with the object of your contemplation. This state 
is surpassed by actual enlightenment, or spiritual liberation.
The sacred syllable om
The best known traditional mantra, used by 
Hindus and Buddhists alike, is the sacred syl-
lable om (pronounced ommm, with a long o 
sound). It’s the symbol of the absolute reality — 
the Self or spirit. It’s composed of the letters a, u, 
and m and the nasal humming of the letter m. A 
corresponds to the waking state, u to the dream 
state, and m to the state of deep sleep; the nasal 
humming sound represents the ultimate reality. 
We introduce several other traditional mantras 
in Chapter 21 in our coverage of meditation.

Tantra Yoga: The Yoga of continuity
Tantra Yoga is the most complex and most widely misunderstood branch 
of Yoga. In the West and in India, Tantra Yoga is often confused with “spiri-
tualized” sex; although sexual rituals are used in some (so-called left-hand) 
schools of Tantra Yoga, they aren’t a regular practice in the majority of 
(so-called right-hand) schools. Tantra Yoga is actually a strict spiritual dis-
cipline involving fairly complex rituals and detailed visualizations of deities. 
These deities are either visions of the divine or the equivalent of Christianity’s 
angels and are invoked to aid the yogic process of contemplation.
Another common name for Tantra Yoga is Kundalini Yoga (pronounced 
koon-dah-lee-nee). The latter name, which means “she who is coiled,” hints at 
the secret “serpent power” that Tantra Yoga seeks to activate: the latent spiri-
tual energy stored in the human body. If you’re curious about this aspect of 
Yoga, you may want to read the autobiographical account by Gopi Krishna (see 
the appendix) or my (Georg’s) Tantra: The Path of Ecstasy (Shambhala). Note: 
Kundalini Yoga is also the name of a Hatha Yoga style; we discuss it in “Getting 
The Scoop on the Prominent Styles of Hatha Yoga” later in the chapter.
Guru Yoga: The Yoga of dedication 
to a master
In Guru Yoga, your teacher is the main focus of spiritual practice. Such a 
teacher is expected to be enlightened or at least close to being enlightened 
(see Chapter 21 for more about enlightenment). In Guru Yoga, you honor and 
meditate on your guru until you merge with him or her. Because the guru is 
thought to already be one with the ultimate reality, this merger duplicates his 
or her spiritual realization in you.
 
But, please, don’t merge too readily! This Yoga is relatively rare in the West, 
so approach it with great caution to avoid possible exploitation.
Getting The Scoop on the Prominent 
Styles of Hatha Yoga
In its voyage to modernity, Yoga has undergone many transformations. One of 
them was Hatha Yoga, which emerged around 1100 AD. The most significant 

17
 Chapter 1: Yoga 101: What You Need to Know
adaptations, however, were made during the past several decades, particularly 
to serve the needs or wants of Western students. Of the many styles of Hatha 
Yoga available today, the following are the best known:
 
✓ Iyengar Yoga, which is the most widely recognized approach to Hatha 
Yoga, was created by B. K. S. Iyengar, the brother in-law of the famous 
T.S. Krishnamacharya (1888–1989) and uncle of T.K.V. Desikachar. This 
style is characterized by precision performance and the aid of numer-
ous props. Iyengar has trained thousands of teachers, many of whom 
are in the United States. His Ramamani Iyengar Memorial Yoga Institute, 
founded in 1974 and dedicated to his late wife Ramamani, is located in 
Pune, India.
 
✓ Viniyoga (pronounced vee-nee yoh-gah) is the approach first developed 
by Shri Krishnamacharya and continued with his son T.K.V. Desikachar. 
The emphasis is on the breath and practicing Yoga according to your 
individual needs and capacities. In the United States, Viniyoga is now 
associated with Gary Kraftsow and the American Viniyoga Institute 
(AVI); Desikachar has expanded his approach in conjunction with 
his son Kausthub under the new umbrella of The Krishnamacharya 
Healing and Yoga Foundation (KHYF), headquartered in Chennai 
(formerly Madras), India. As the teacher of well-known Yoga mas-
ters B.K.S. Iyengar, K. Pattabhi Jois, and Indra Devi, Professor T.S. 
Krishnamacharya can be said to have launched a veritable Hatha Yoga 
renaissance in modern times that is still sweeping the world. 
 
✓ Ashtanga Yoga originated with Shri Krishnamacharya and was taught by 
K. Pattabhi Jois, who was born in 1915 but who had a suitably modern 
outlook to draw eager Western students to his Mysore, India, Ashtanga 
Yoga Institute until his death in 2009. He was a principal disciple of 
T.S. Krishnamacharya, who apparently instructed him to teach the 
sequences known as Ashtanga Yoga or Power Yoga. This style is by far 
the most athletic of the three versions of Hatha Yoga, going back to T.S. 
Krishnamacharya, and it combines postures with breathing. Ashtanga 
Yoga differs from Patanjali’s eightfold path (also called Ashtanga Yoga), 
though it’s theoretically grounded in it. (We discuss the Ashtanga Yoga 
tradition in “Considering Your Options: The Eight Main Branches of 
Yoga” earlier in this chapter.)
 
 Power Yoga is a generic term for any style that follows closely Ashtanga 
Yoga but doesn’t have a set series of postures. It emphasizes flexibility 
and strength and was mainly responsible for introducing Yoga postures 
into gyms. Beryl Bender Birch, Bryan Kest, Baron Baptiste, and Sherri 
Baptiste Freeman are all closely associated with Power Yoga. In a similar 
manner, Vinyasa Yoga and Flow Yoga, developed by Ganga White and 
Tracey Rich, are also variatons of Ashtanga Yoga.

18
Part I: Off to a Good Start with Yoga 
 
✓ Anusara Yoga, with strong roots in Iyengar Yoga, has attained great 
popularity within a short span of time. Created in 1997 by the American 
Yoga teacher John Friend, its appeal is in its heart-centered approach. 
Based on the three As — attitude, alignment, and action — Anusara 
Yoga seeks to bring “grace” (anusara) into a posture and thus give Hatha 
Yoga a spiritual thrust.
 
✓ Kripalu Yoga, inspired by Swami Kripalvananda (1913–1981) and devel-
oped by his disciple Yogi Amrit Desai, is a three-stage Yoga tailored 
for the needs of Western students. The first stage emphasizes postural 
alignment and coordination of breath and movement; you hold the pos-
tures for a short time only. The second stage adds meditation and pro-
longs the postures. In the final stage, practicing the postures becomes a 
spontaneous meditation in motion. See Chapter 24 for more information 
about the Kripalu Yoga Center in Massachusetts.
 
✓ Integral Yoga was developed by Swami Satchidananda (1914–2002), 
a student of the famous Swami Sivananda of Rishikesh, India. Swami 
Satchidananda made his debut at the Woodstock festival in 1969, 
where he taught the baby boomers to chant om, and over the years has 
attracted thousands of students. As the name suggests, this style aims 
to integrate the various aspects of the body-mind through a combina-
tion of postures, breathing techniques, deep relaxation, and meditation. 
Chapter 24 gives you more information about the Satchidananda Ashram 
in Virginia.
 
✓ Sivananda Yoga is the creation of the late Swami Vishnudevananda 
(1927–1993), also a disciple of Swami Sivananda of Rishikesh, India, who 
established his Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Center in Montreal in 1959. 
He trained over 6,000 teachers, and you can find numerous Sivananda 
centers around the world. This style includes a series of 12 postures, 
the Sun Salutation sequence, breathing exercises, relaxation, and mantra 
chanting.
 
✓ Ananda Yoga is anchored in the teachings of Paramahansa Yogananda 
(1893–1952) and was developed by Swami Kriyananda (Donald Walters), 
one of his disciples. This gentle style prepares the student for medita-
tion, and its distinguishing features are the silent affirmations associ-
ated with holding the postures. This Yoga style includes Yogananda’s 
unique energization exercises, first developed in 1917, which involve 
consciously directing the body’s energy (life force) to different organs 
and limbs. You can find more information about the Ananda Institute of 
Alternative Living in Nevada City, California, in Chapter 24.
 
✓ Kundalini Yoga isn’t only an independent approach of Yoga but also the 
name of a style of Hatha Yoga, originated by the Sikh master Yogi Bhajan 
(1929–2004). Its purpose is to awaken the serpent power (kundalini) 
by means of postures, breath control, chanting, and meditation. Yogi 

19
 Chapter 1: Yoga 101: What You Need to Know
Bhajan, who came to the United States in 1969, is the founder and 
spiritual head of the Healthy, Happy, Holy Organization (3HO), which 
has headquarters in Los Angeles and numerous branches around the 
world. (We cover the Kundalini Yoga approach in the earlier section 
“Considering Your Options: The Eight Main Branches of Yoga.”)
 
✓ Hidden Language Yoga was developed by the late Swami Sivananda 
Radha (1911–1995), a German-born female student of Swami Sivananda. 
This style seeks to promote not only physical well-being but also self-
understanding by exploring the symbolism inherent in the postures. 
Hidden Language Yoga is taught by the teachers of Yasodhara Ashram 
in British Columbia (see Chapter 24).
 
✓ Somatic Yoga is the creation of Eleanor Criswell, EdD, a professor of 
psychology at Sonoma State University in California who has taught 
Yoga since the early 1960s. Somatic Yoga is an integrated approach to 
the harmonious development of body and mind, based both on tradi-
tional yogic principles and modern psychophysiological research. This 
gentle approach emphasizes visualization, very slow movement into and 
out of postures, conscious breathing, mindfulness, and frequent relax-
ation between postures.
 
✓ Moksha Yoga, which was originally based on the style of Bikram Yoga 
(in the following bullet) and is popular in Canada, uses traditional pos-
tures in a heated room and includes relaxation periods. It champions a 
green philosophy.
 
✓ Bikram Yoga is the style taught by Bikram Choudhury. Bikram 
Choudhury, who achieved fame as the teacher of Hollywood stars, 
teaches at the Yoga College of India in Bombay and other locations 
around the world, including San Francisco and Tokyo. This style, which 
has a set routine of 26 postures, is fairly vigorous and requires a certain 
fitness level for participation, especially because it calls for a high room 
temperature. 
You also may hear or see a mention of other Yoga styles, including Tri Yoga 
(developed by Kali Ray), White Lotus Yoga (developed by Ganga White and 
Tracey Rich), Jivamukti (developed by Sharon Gannon and David Life), Ishta 
Yoga (an acronym for the Integrated Science of Hatha, Tantra, and Ayurveda, 
developed by Mani Finger), Forrest Yoga (a mixture of Hatha Yoga and Native 
American ideas created by Ana Forrest), and Prime of Life Yoga (developed 
by me [Larry]) for midlife and beyond.
 
Hot Yoga isn’t really a style itself; it just means that the practice occurs in a 
high-temperature room (90 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit). It usually refers to 
either Ashtanga Yoga or Bikram Yoga.

Finding Your Niche: Five Basic 
Approaches to Yoga
Since Yoga came to the Western hemisphere from its Indian homeland in the 
late 19th century, it has undergone various adaptations. Today, Yoga is prac-
ticed in five major ways:
 
✓ As a method for physical fitness and health maintenance
 
✓ As a sport
 
✓ As body-oriented therapy
 
✓ As a comprehensive lifestyle
 
✓ As a spiritual discipline
The first three approaches are often grouped into the category of Postural 
Yoga, which is contrasted with Traditional Yoga (the final two bullets). As its 
name suggests, Postural Yoga focuses (sometimes exclusively) on Yoga pos-
tures. Traditional Yoga seeks to adhere to the traditional teachings as taught 
anciently in India. We take a look at the five basic approaches in the upcom-
ing sections.
Yoga as fitness training
The first approach, Yoga as fitness training, is the most popular way that 
Westerners practice Yoga. It’s also the most radical revamping of Traditional 
Yoga. More precisely, it’s a modification of traditional Hatha Yoga. Yoga as 
fitness training is concerned primarily with the physical body’s flexibility, 
resilience, and strength. Fitness is how most newcomers to Yoga encounter 
this great tradition. Fitness training is certainly a useful gateway into Yoga, 
but later on, some people discover that Hatha Yoga is a profound spiritual 
tradition. From the earliest times, Yoga masters have emphasized the need 
for a healthy body. But they’ve also always pointed beyond the body to the 
mind and other vital aspects of the being.
Yoga as a sport
Yoga as a sport is an especially prominent approach in some Latin American 
countries. Its practitioners, many of whom are excellent athletes, master 
hundreds of extremely difficult Yoga postures to perfection and demonstrate 

21
 Chapter 1: Yoga 101: What You Need to Know
their skills and beautiful physiques in international competitions. But this 
new sport, which also can be regarded as an art form, has drawn much criti-
cism from the ranks of more traditional Yoga practitioners who feel that 
competition has no place in Yoga. Yet this athletic orientation has done 
much to put Yoga on the map in some parts of the world, and we see nothing 
wrong with good-natured Yoga “competitions” as long as participants hold self-
centered competitiveness in check.
 
The increasingly popular fad of Acro-Yoga, which specializes in acrobatic 
moves done in combination with a partner, also falls into the Yoga-as-a-sport 
category. Only the fittest and most flexible are able to practice this modern 
variation of Yoga without risk of injury. However, purists find fault with the 
lack of spiritual and ethical intention behind this style of Hatha Yoga.
Yoga as therapy
The third approach, Yoga as therapy, applies yogic techniques to restore 
health or full physical and mental function. In recent years, some Western 
Yoga teachers have begun to use yogic practices for therapeutic purpose. 
Although the idea behind Yoga therapy is very old, its name is fairly new. 
In fact, Yoga therapy is a whole new professional discipline, calling for far 
greater training and skill on the part of the teacher than is the case with 
ordinary Yoga. Commonly, Yoga is intended for those who don’t suffer from 
disabilities or ailments requiring remedial action and special attention. Yoga 
therapy, on the other hand, addresses these special needs. For example, 
Yoga therapy may be able to help you find relief from many common ail-
ments. Chapter 22 of this book shows you some basic yogic techniques for 
improving common lower and upper back problems. 
Yoga as a lifestyle
Yoga as a lifestyle enters the proper domain of Traditional Yoga. Yoga once 
or twice a week for an hour or so is certainly better than no Yoga at all. And 
Yoga can be enormously beneficial even when practiced only as fitness train-
ing or as so-called Postural Yoga. But you unlock the real potency of Yoga 
when you adopt it as a lifestyle — living Yoga and practicing it every day 
whether through physical exercises or meditation. Above all, you apply the 
wisdom of Yoga to everyday life and live lucidly, with awareness. Yoga has 
much to say about what and how you should eat, how you should sleep, how 
you should work, how you should relate to others, and so on. It offers a total 
system of conscious and skillful living.

22
Part I: Off to a Good Start with Yoga 
 
In modern times, a Yoga lifestyle includes caring for the ailing environment, an 
idea especially captured in Green Yoga. (Check out the sidebar “Healing the 
planet through Green Yoga” in this chapter for more information.) Don’t think 
you have to be a yogic superstar to practice lifestyle Yoga. You can begin 
today. Just make a few simple adjustments in your daily schedule and keep 
your goals vividly in front of you. Whenever you’re ready, make further posi-
tive changes one step at a time. See Chapter 20 for more on working Yoga into 
your whole day.
Yoga as a spiritual discipline
Lifestyle Yoga (see the preceding section) is concerned with healthy, whole-
some, functional, and benevolent living. Yoga as a spiritual discipline, the 
fifth and final approach, is concerned with all that plus the traditional ideal 
of enlightenment — that is, discovering your spiritual nature. This approach 
is often equated with Traditional Yoga. (We discuss the journey to enlighten-
ment in Chapter 21.)
The word spiritual has been abused a lot lately, so we need to explain how 
we use it here. Spiritual relates to spirit — your ultimate nature. In Yoga, it’s 
called the atman (pronounced aht-mahn) or purusha (poo-roo-shah).
According to nondualistic (based in one reality) Yoga philosophy, the 
spirit is one and the same in all beings and things. It’s formless, immortal, 
superconscious, and unimaginably blissful. It’s transcendental because it 
exists beyond the limited body and mind. You discover the spirit fully in the 
moment of your enlightenment.
What most approaches to Yoga 
have in common
Most traditional or tradition-oriented approaches to Yoga share two funda-
mental practices, the cultivation of awareness and relaxation:
 
✓ Awareness is the peculiarly human ability to pay close attention to some-
thing, to be consciously present, and to be mindful. Yoga is attention 
training. To see what we mean, try this exercise: Pay attention to your 
right hand for the next 60 seconds. That is, feel your right hand and do 
nothing else. Chances are, your mind is drifting off after only a few sec-
onds. Yoga asks you to rein in your attention whenever it strays.
 
✓ Relaxation is the conscious release of unnecessary and therefore 
unwholesome tension in the body.

23
 Chapter 1: Yoga 101: What You Need to Know
 
Both awareness and relaxation go hand in hand in Yoga. Without bringing 
awareness and relaxation to Yoga, the exercises are merely exercises — not 
yogic exercises.
Conscious breathing is often added to awareness and relaxation as a third 
foundational practice. Normally, breathing happens automatically. In Yoga, 
you bring awareness to this act, which then makes it into a powerful tool for 
training your body and your mind. We say much more about these aspects of 
Yoga in Chapter 5.
Health, Healing, and Yoga
The source of your health and happiness lies within you. Outside agents like 
physicians, therapists, or remedies can help you through major crises, but 
you yourself are primarily responsible for your own health and happiness. 
The following sections show you how Yoga helps you mobilize the inner 
strength to live responsibly and wisely.
What is health? Most people answer this question by saying that health is 
the opposite of illness, but health is more than the absence of disease — it’s 
a positive state of being. Health is wholeness. To be healthy means not only 
to possess a well-functioning body and a sane mind but also to vibrate with 
life, to be vitally connected with your social and physical environment. To be 
healthy also means to be happy.
Something for nothing?
You get out of Yoga what you put into it. One com-
puter term particularly relevant to Yoga practice 
is gigo, which means “garbage in, garbage out.” 
It captures a simple truth: The quality of a cause 
determines the quality of the effect — what you 
get out of any endeavor is only as good as what 
you put in. In other words,
 ✓ Don’t expect health from junk food.
 ✓ Don’t expect happiness from miserable 
attitudes.
 ✓ Don’t expect good results from shoddy 
Yoga practice.
 ✓ Don’t expect something from nothing.
Yoga is a powerful tool, but you must learn to 
use it properly. You can buy the latest super-
duper computer, but if you only know how to 
use it as a typewriter, that’s all it is.

24
Part I: Off to a Good Start with Yoga 
Because life is constant movement, you shouldn’t expect health to be static. 
Today health is increasingly difficult to achieve because the environment has 
become highly toxic. Perfect health is a mirage. In the course of your life, you 
can expect inevitable fluctuations in your state of health; even cutting your 
finger with a knife temporarily upsets the balance. Your body reacts to the 
cut by mobilizing all the necessary biochemical forces to heal itself. Regular 
Yoga practice can create optimal conditions for self-healing. You achieve a 
baseline of health, with an improved immune system that enables you to stay 
healthy longer and heal faster.
Yoga is about healing rather than curing. Like a really good physician, Yoga 
takes deeper causes into account instead of slapping a bandage on surface 
symptoms. These causes are more often than not found in the mind — in 
the way you live and how you think. That’s why Yoga masters recommend 
self-understanding. Most people tend to be passive in health matters. They 
wait until something goes wrong and then rely on a pill or a physician to fix 
the problem. Yoga encourages you to take the initiative in preventing illness 
and restoring or maintaining your health. Taking control of your health has 
nothing to do with self-doctoring (which can be dangerous); it’s simply a 
matter of taking responsibility for your health. A good physician can tell you 
that a patient’s active participation in the process greatly facilitates healing. 
For example, you may take various kinds of medication to deal with a gastric 
ulcer, but unless you learn to eat well, sleep adequately, avoid stress, and 
take life more easily, you’re bound to have a recurrence before long. You 
must change your lifestyle to realize any deep-seated healing.
Yoga points the way to happiness, health, and life-embracing meaning by sug-
gesting that the best possible meaning you can find for yourself springs from 
the well of joy deep within you. That joy or bliss is the very nature of the 
spirit, or transcendental Self (refer to “Yoga as a spiritual discipline” earlier 
in this chapter). Joy is like a 3-D lens that captures life’s bright colors and 
motivates you to embrace life in all its countless forms.
Balancing Your Life with Yoga
The Hindu tradition explains Yoga as the discipline of balance, another way 
of expressing the ideal of unity through Yoga. Everything in you must har-
monize to function optimally. A disharmonious mind is disturbing in itself, 
but sooner or later it also causes physical problems. An imbalanced body 
can easily warp your emotions and thought processes. If you have strained 
relationships with others, you cause distress not only for them but also for 
yourself. And when your relationship to your physical environment is dishar-
monious, well, you trigger serious repercussions for everyone.

25
 Chapter 1: Yoga 101: What You Need to Know
A beautiful and simple Yoga exercise called “The Tree” (described in 
Chapter 9) improves your sense of balance and promotes your inner still-
ness. Even when conditions force a tree to grow askew, it always balances 
itself out by growing a branch in the direction opposite its lean, so in this 
posture, you stand still like a tree, perfectly balanced.
 
Yoga helps you apply this principle to your life. Whenever life’s demands and 
challenges force you to bend to one side, your inner strength and peace of 
mind serve as counterweights. Rising above all adversity, you can never be 
uprooted.
Healing the planet through Green Yoga
The environmental crisis, which is sharpening 
day by day, is prompting more and more yogis 
and yoginis to apply Yoga’s ethical standards 
specifically to the health of the ailing planet. 
This Green Yoga approach is explained in my 
(Georg’s) and Brenda Feuerstein’s book Green 
Yoga (Traditional Yoga Studies).
Green Yoga is Yoga that incorporates environ-
mental mindfulness and activism in its spiritual 
orientation. It centers on a deep reverence for 
all life and a lifestyle of voluntary simplicity; it 
believes the time has come to make Yoga count 
in more than personal terms.
If you want to get started on greening your 
Yoga, try carpooling or biking to your next class, 
or use an environment-friendly Yoga mat. Also, 
reduce! Reuse! Recycle!

Chapter 2
Ready, Set, Yoga!
In This Chapter
▶ Being clear about why you want to practice
▶ Finding the right Yoga style, class, and teacher (or lack thereof) for yourself
▶ Preparing for a Yoga session
T
his chapter gives you everything you need to prepare for your Yoga 
practice, whether you opt to take part in a class or practice solo. We 
discuss setting goals, getting the proper gear, finding enough time to prac-
tice, and more.
 
Make sure that you’re physically ready before you begin this new venture with 
Yoga or any fitness activity. Consult with your doctor, especially if you have 
an existing health challenge. Even if your medical history includes experience 
with hypertension, heart problems, arthritis, or chronic back pain, you can 
benefit from Yoga. In more severe cases, you may want to work closely with a 
competent Yoga therapist to create just the right routines and to monitor your 
progress.
Setting a Goal for Your Practice
Before you start too far into considering classes and purchasing gear, first 
things first. Take a deep breath, exhale slowly, and then ask yourself: What 
do I want from my Yoga experience? Consider the following questions:
 
✓ Do I simply want to try Hatha Yoga because it’s a trendy thing to do?
 
✓ Am I hoping to find a way to decompress (clear the mind and alleviate 
stress)?
 
✓ Is physical fitness my main interest?

28
Part I: Off to a Good Start with Yoga 
 
✓ Do I simply want to have a more flexible body?
 
✓ Does meditation intrigue me?
 
✓ Do the spiritual aspects of Yoga interest me?
 
✓ Do I have health concerns, such as lower back problems or hyperten-
sion that I expect Yoga to help handle?
Obviously, if your goals are entirely spiritual, you must choose a branch of 
Yoga that can best help you achieve those goals. You may resonate with 
Bhakti Yoga, Jnana Yoga, Raja Yoga, Karma Yoga, or Tantra Yoga, all of which 
we introduce in Chapter 1. (Unfortunately, you also need to pick up a differ-
ent book because this book is meant to primarily serve candidates of Hatha 
Yoga, which is the most popular branch in the West.) If your main interest 
is in improving your health or overall physical well-being, or you want to 
become fit and flexible, you have to select which style of Hatha Yoga fits you 
best (refer to Chapter 1 for more).
 
After you’re clear about your motivation and expectations, don’t just think 
it — ink it. Write down your goals so that you can really focus on your specific 
needs. For example, your goal may be to be able to better cope with stress. 
In order to achieve that goal, you have to take your particular needs into 
account. If you’re a super-busy mom and have only half an hour of slack time 
at night during the week and perhaps a full hour on Sundays, your need is 
obviously to keep your Yoga program very simple.
No excuses, please
Most people are aware of how fast time flies 
in the 24 hours they’re given each day. Yet if 
you look more closely at how you spend your 
days, you may find that not everything you do is 
necessary, and that in idle moments, you may 
miss the opportunity to recharge yourself or tap 
into your inner well of joy. If you’ve picked up 
this book and are reading these lines, chances 
are you have enough time to practice Yoga 
regularly.
If you think you’re not capable of practic-
ing Hatha Yoga because it requires too much 
flexibility or is otherwise too demanding physi-
cally, turn your attention to this truth: You can 
be as stiff as a board and still benefit from Yoga! 
The yogic postures help you become more flex-
ible, whatever your starting point. Don’t gauge 
yourself by the photos you may see in some 
Yoga books. They usually show advanced prac-
titioners at their best. This book focuses on the 
needs of beginners. After you take the first few 
steps, the next big leap may not seem quite so 
challenging.

Checking Out Various Yoga Class Options
So, you’re sure that you want to take the Yoga plunge. What’s your safest 
bet? To put it plainly, set your sights on a suitable Yoga class or teacher 
instead of sailing away as a strict do-it-yourselfer. Although you can explore 
some basic practices by reading about them (this book makes sure of that!), 
a full-fledged, safe Yoga routine really requires proper instruction from a 
qualified teacher. The following sections help you determine what kind of 
class to seek out.
Many Yoga schools offer introductory courses (four to six weeks), so you 
don’t have to jump into the deep end. After a few classes and the benefit 
of an instructor’s expert advice, you can certainly continue practicing and 
exploring Yoga on your own (see the section “Skipping Class” later in this 
chapter). In that case, you may still want to check in with a teacher every so 
often, just to make sure that you haven’t acquired any bad habits in execut-
ing the various postures and other practices.
Finding a class that’s right for you
If you live in a big city, you’re bound to have several choices for group 
classes, but if you live in a small town you may have to be more resourceful. 
Here are some suggestions for finding the Yoga class that’s right for you:
 
✓ Tell your friends that you want to join a Yoga class; some of them may 
start raving about their classes or teachers.
 
✓ Consult the resources we list in the appendix.
 
✓ Look at bulletin boards in health food stores and adult education 
centers.
 
✓ Check online resources (see the appendix).
 
✓ Look into possibilities at your local health club, but before joining a 
Yoga session, make sure that the teacher is really qualified: How much 
training has he or she had? Is proper certification hanging on his or her 
office wall?
 
✓ Ask your local librarian.
 
✓ Head toward the back of the local phone book to check out listings 
under Yoga Instruction.

Part I: Off to a Good Start with Yoga 
Checking out classes and teachers
We think that visiting a few places and teachers is important before committing 
to a course or a series of classes. Some Yoga schools give out the telephone 
numbers of their teachers, and you may want to have a phone conversation 
before making a special trip to the school. When you visit a Yoga center or 
classroom, pay attention to your intuitive feelings about the place. Consider 
how the staff treats you and how you respond to the people attending class. 
Stroll around the facility and feel its overall energy. First impressions are often 
(although not always) accurate. Some teachers even let you quietly look in on 
a class; others find this practice too distracting for their students.
 
Bring a written checklist to your class visit. Don’t feel embarrassed about 
being thorough. If you don’t want to be so obvious, memorize the points that 
you want to check out. Here are some ideas for your list:
 
✓ How do I feel about the building or classroom’s atmosphere?
 
✓ What’s my gut response to the teacher?
 
✓ Do I want a male or female teacher?
 
✓ What are the teacher’s credentials?
 
✓ Does the teacher or school have a good reputation?
 
✓ How do I respond to other students?
 
✓ Do the programs suit my needs?
 
✓ How big are the classes, and can I still get proper, individual attention 
from the teacher?
 
✓ Would I be happy coming here regularly?
 
✓ Can I afford the classes?
When checking out a Yoga center, don’t hesitate to quiz the instructor or other 
staff members about any concerns. In particular, find out what style of Hatha 
Yoga they offer. Some styles — notably Ashtanga or Power Yoga — demand 
athletic fitness. Others embody a more relaxed approach. In this book, we 
favor the latter. However, we can readily appreciate that some vigorous people 
may feel attracted to and benefit from yogic routines that are the equivalent of 
a workout and that call for strength, endurance, high flexibility, and a drench of 
perspiration.
If you’re not familiar with the style of a particular school, don’t hesitate to 
ask for an explanation (check out our explanation of styles in Chapter 1). 
Yoga practitioners are usually pretty friendly folk, eager to answer your ques-
tions and put your mind at ease. If they aren’t, put a mark in the appropriate 
box in your mental checklist. Remember that even nice people, including 
Yoga practitioners, can have occasional off-days. But if you don’t feel wel-
come and comfortable on your first visit, you probably won’t receive better 
treatment later on.

31
 Chapter 2: Ready, Set, Yoga!
Making sure courses fit your experience level
If you’re a beginner, look for a beginner’s course. You’re likely to feel more 
comfortable in a group that’s starting at the same skill level instead of being 
surrounded by advanced practitioners who can perform difficult postures 
easily and elegantly. Whatever the skill level of a class, don’t feel self-conscious. 
None of the advanced students will stare at you to see whether the new kid in 
class is any good. You may get a few encouraging smiles, though.
 
Beginner classes are sometimes advertised as Easy Does It Yoga or Gentle 
Yoga.
 
As a beginner, be leery of overly large classes (more than 20 students) or 
mixed-level classes that lump together Yoga freshmen with postgraduates. Your 
teacher can’t give you the attention you deserve to ensure your safety. Keep in 
mind, though, that many of the more experienced teachers are quite popular, 
and their classes tend to be large; you may have to decide whether personal 
attention or a higher level of teacher experience is more important to you.
Public or private?
Decide whether you want to learn Hatha Yoga in a group or from a private 
instructor. In practice, most people start with a group class because of the 
cost and the boost in motivation that comes from practicing with other 
people. If you can afford private lessons, however, even a few sessions can be 
extremely beneficial. Importantly, if you have a serious health challenge, you 
need to work privately with a Yoga therapist (see the appendix for a list of 
organizations specializing in Yoga therapy).
What makes a good teacher?
A good Yoga teacher should be an example of 
what Yoga is all about: a balanced person who 
isn’t only skillful in the postures but also courte-
ous and thoughtful toward others and adaptive 
and attentive to everyone’s individual needs in 
class. Check out the teacher’s credentials to be 
sure that he or she has been properly trained 
or is certified in one of the established tradi-
tions. Consult Chapter 23 and the appendix for 
our recommendations on some of the well-
established larger Yoga organizations.
We caution you to steer clear of teachers who 
have taken only a few workshops on Yoga or 
received their diplomas in a three-day course. 
They may be excellent aerobics instructors 
who know nothing about Yoga. Also avoid the 
drill sergeant type or anyone who makes you 
feel intimidated about your level of skill in per-
forming the postures. By the way, under no 
circumstances allow your instructor to push or 
coerce you into a posture that doesn’t feel right 
or that causes you pain.

32
Part I: Off to a Good Start with Yoga 
Here’s a sampling of the advantages of private lessons:
 
✓ You get personalized attention.
 
✓ You have the opportunity to interact more with the teacher during class.
 
✓ Your routines can vary more, with proper supervision.
 
✓ You can work more intensively with those exercises that are more chal-
lenging for you.
 
✓ If you’re shy or easily distracted, you don’t have to worry about the 
company of other people.
Here are a few advantages of group practice:
 
✓ You experience the support of the group.
 
✓ Your motivation is strengthened by seeing others succeed.
 
✓ You can make good, like-minded friends.
 
✓ Group sessions are easy on your pocketbook.
Checking the time: How long 
does a Yoga class last?
The length of a group Yoga class varies from 50 to 90 minutes. Health clubs, 
fitness spas, and corporate classes are normally 50 to 60 minutes long, but 
beginning classes at Yoga centers usually last from 75 to 90 minutes long. A 
private Yoga lesson customarily lasts one hour.
Backyard studios and home classes
Throughout the world, many Yoga teachers 
hold sessions in their homes or in backyard 
studios. Don’t let this practice turn you off — 
you may find a great opportunity. Some of the 
most dedicated Yoga teachers work this way 
because they want to avoid commercialism and 
the details of administering a full-scale center. 
Backyard studios often offer a great sense of 
community, and you can also expect lots of 
valuable, personal attention from the teacher 
because the groups tend to be smaller than 
those in larger centers.

33
 Chapter 2: Ready, Set, Yoga!
Paying the price: How much 
should a Yoga class cost?
In general, group Yoga classes are pretty affordable. The cheapest classes 
are usually available at adult education centers and community and senior 
centers. YMCA and YWCA classes also tend to be reasonably priced, or your 
health club may even include free Yoga classes as part of a fitness package. 
Most regular Yoga centers in metropolitan areas, however, charge on average 
$10 to $15 per class. A one-time drop-in fee (for those who haven’t commit-
ted to taking more than one class) is usually a couple of dollars higher. Some 
schools offer the first class free, and others charge as much as $25.
You can do your own pricing research by phone and computer. More and more 
Yoga sites advertise on the Internet (see the appendix). They usually don’t men-
tion fees, but they do provide you with an e-mail address or a phone number. 
When you’re considering a commitment to a Yoga center, check into the larger 
packages — they’re often a good investment. Obviously, private lessons are 
quite a bit more expensive than group classes and range from $50 to $150.
Whenever you smell commercialism, you can be fairly sure your nose isn’t 
deceiving you. If you’re uncomfortable with the price you’re quoted for Yoga 
classes, just search out a more reasonable offer. Here and there, you can even 
find free-of-charge classes, notably in Canada. Who said you can’t get a free ride?
Going co-ed
Most Yoga classes welcome both genders, with an average ratio of seven 
women to three men enrolled in any session. Some of the more physically 
demanding styles of Hatha Yoga, however, attract an equal number of ath-
letic men and women.
Dressing for Success, and Other Yoga 
Practicing Considerations
After you choose a class you think can work for you, you may be nervous 
about actually taking the plunge and heading to your first session. The follow-
ing sections aim to answer your questions about what to wear and take and 
how to stay safe (and in the good graces of your classmates) as you begin 
your group Yoga journey.

34
Part I: Off to a Good Start with Yoga 
Deciding what to wear
Yoga practitioners wear a wide variety of exercise clothing. Practically speak-
ing, what people wear depends on the difficulty level of the class and the tem-
perature of the room. Of course, personal expression is also a consideration. A 
handful of eccentric groups practice in the nude, which really isn’t a good idea 
because it’s bound to distract some folks. Besides, you can easily catch a chill. 
Even when you practice on your own, you may want to cover your lower trunk 
to protect your kidneys and abdomen. At least that’s the traditional Yoga way.
Women often wear leotards, sweats, shorts, and tops. Men usually wear 
shorts, sweats, T-shirts, and tank tops.
 
The key is to wear clean, comfortable, and decent clothes that allow you to 
move and breathe freely. Some people want to be fashionable by wearing the 
latest attention-drawing outfits, but we discourage this attitude. Simple does it!
If you’re practicing outdoors or in a poorly heated room, you may want to 
layer your clothing so that you can peel off a layer when you’re getting too 
warm from your Yoga practice. Also, extra clothing can come in handy when 
you get to the relaxation or meditation part of the class.
Packing your Yoga kit
Before attending a class, find out what kind of floor it practices on. If the floor 
is carpeted, a towel or a sticky mat works (we describe sticky mats and similar 
useful items in Chapter 19). A hardwood floor may require more padding, espe-
cially if your knees are sensitive. In that case, bring along a thick Yoga mat or a 
rug remnant that is a little longer than your height and a little wider than your 
shoulders. If you have a tendency to get cold, bring a blanket to cover yourself 
during final relaxation. A folded blanket is also helpful if you need a pad under 
your head when you’re lying down. As your teacher becomes familiar with your 
unique needs, he or she may suggest some other personalized props for you to 
bring to class. As we discuss in Chapter 1, some Yoga styles — notably Iyengar 
Yoga — work more with props than others. Following are some general items 
you may want to bring to class with you:
 
✓ Your own Yoga mat or rug
 
✓ A towel
 
✓ A blanket
 
✓ Extra clothing to layer on if the room is too cool or to take off if you’re 
too warm
 
✓ Bottled water (to balance your electrolytes after the session); we recom-
mend that you use a steel flask with your own filtered water
 
✓ Enthusiasm, motivation, and good humor

35
 Chapter 2: Ready, Set, Yoga!
 
If you’re serious about your Yoga practice (and if you’re concerned about 
hygiene), we recommend that you invest in your own personal mat and other 
equipment. Although many Yoga centers furnish this stuff, consider bringing 
your own. If you ever have to pick from the bottom of the bin after yet another 
sweaty class, you’ll know what we mean.
Putting safety first
The most important factor for determining the safety of a Yoga class is your 
personal attitude. If you participate with the understanding that you aren’t 
competing against the other students or the teacher and that you also must 
not inflict pain upon yourself, you can enjoy a safe Yoga practice. The popu-
lar maxim “No pain, no gain” doesn’t really apply to Yoga. Perhaps “No gain 
with negative pain” is a better mindset.
By negative pain, we mean discomfort that causes you distress or increases 
the likelihood of injury. Of course, if you haven’t exercised for a while, you 
can expect to encounter your body’s resistance at the beginning. You may 
even feel a little sore the next day, which just reflects your body’s adjust-
ment to the new adventure. The key to avoiding injury is to proceed gently. 
It’s better to err on the side of gentleness than to face torn ligaments. A good 
teacher always reminds you to ease into the postures and work creatively 
with your body’s physical resistance. Nonharming is an important moral 
virtue in Yoga — and observation toward all beings includes yourself!
If you have any physical limitations (recent surgeries, knee, neck, or back 
problems, and so on), be sure to inform the center and the teacher beforehand. 
In a classroom setting, instructors have to split their attention among several 
students; your upfront communication can help prevent personal injury.
Making time for Yoga
For centuries, the traditional time for Yoga 
practice has been sunrise and sunset, which 
are thought to be especially auspicious. These 
days, busy lifestyles can toss out lots of obsta-
cles to your best intentions, so be pragmatic 
and arrange your Yoga practice at your conve-
nience. Just keep in mind that statistically, you 
have a 30 percent greater chance of accom-
plishing a fitness goal if you practice in the 
morning. More important than holding tight to 
a preset time is just making sure that you work 
Yoga into your schedule somewhere — and 
stick with it.
Practicing at roughly the same time during the 
day can help you create a positive habit, which 
may make it easier to maintain your routine.

36
Part I: Off to a Good Start with Yoga 
 
If a teacher insists that you do an exercise or a routine that feels very uncom-
fortable or that you feel may hurt you, take a break on your mat or, if that isn’t 
possible, just walk out of the class. Try to stay cool and register your com-
plaint with the school afterward. Fortunately, this situation rarely happens.
Paging Miss Manners
In all social settings, common courtesy calls for sensitivity to others; those 
same rules of responsible conduct apply to your participation in Yoga group 
sessions. So, sift through all the good manners you’ve accumulated from a life-
time of human interaction, and pack them as required equipment for your next 
trip to class. Before you go, check your bags for these etiquette essentials:
 
✓ Show up on time; don’t wander into class “fashionably” late. It’s rude 
and disturbing to others.
 
✓ If you show up early and students from the class before are still relaxing 
or meditating, respect their quiet time until your own session formally 
begins.
 
✓ Leave your shoes, chewing gum, cellphones, pagers, and crummy atti-
tudes outside the classroom.
 
✓ Avoid smoking cigarettes or drinking alcohol before class.
 
✓ Bathe and take a restroom break before your Yoga session.
 
✓ Keep classroom conversation to a minimum — some people arrive early 
to meditate or to just sit quietly.
 
✓ Be sure to take your socks off if you practice on a slippery surface (just 
don’t leave them near your neighbor’s face). If you’re self-conscious 
about your feet (“those ugly things”), remember that their 26 bones do a 
great job at propping up your body all day long. Besides, everyone else 
is far too busy to focus on your feet.
 
✓ Avoid excessive, clanky jewelry.
 
✓ Be sure that your, ahem, private parts are appropriately covered if you 
choose to wear loose-fitting shorts or, against our advice, super-tight 
outfits.
 
✓ Don’t wear heavy perfume or cologne.
 
✓ Cut back on your garlic consumption on the day that you go to class.
 
✓ Sit near the door or window if you require a lot of air.
 
✓ Sit close to the instructor if you have hearing difficulties; many teachers 
speak softly to generate the right mood.
 
✓ If you have used any props in class, put them away neatly.
 
✓ Pay your teacher on time, without having to be reminded.

37
 Chapter 2: Ready, Set, Yoga!
Skipping Class
Traditionally, Yoga is passed down from teacher to student. However, a few 
accomplished yogis and yoginis are self-taught. These independent spirits set 
a precedent for those who enjoy exploring new territory on their own. If you 
live in an isolated area and don’t have easy access to a Yoga instructor or 
class, don’t be disheartened. You still have several choices that can help you 
begin your yogic journey (and in the appendix we provide you with a fairly 
extensive list of resources). Here’s an abbreviated version:
 
✓ Audiocassettes
 
✓ Books
 
✓ CDs
 
✓ DVDs
 
✓ Magazines
 
✓ Newsletters
 
✓ Newspapers
 
✓ Television
 
✓ Videos
Because Yoga is a motor skill, most people without access to a teacher rely 
on a DVD or video for instruction. If you opt for this particular approach, 
we recommend that you learn a routine and then begin listening only to the 
instructor’s voice rather than focusing on the screen. Yoga emphasizes more 
inner work than outer activity; watching the screen interferes with this pro-
cess. Listening to a disembodied voice works better. According to Yoga, the 
eye is an active and even aggressive sense, whereas the ear is a more pas-
sive receptor. That’s why CDs and audiotapes can also work well, provided 
they’re accompanied by informative illustrations.
We prefer a good Yoga book over magazine or newspaper articles, simply 
because the creation of a book usually requires more in-depth, detailed con-
sideration of subject matter and presentation. Plus, they have fewer adver-
tisements taking up valuable space than periodicals do. Look for our book 
recommendations in the appendix. But don’t discount the value of a newsletter 
from a backyard Yoga studio, especially if it comes to you via the electronic 
ether. The publication can be a real find if it comes from a legitimate source.
The difficulty with self-tutoring at the beginning is that you may have trouble 
judging good form from bad form. You need time to understand how your 
body responds to the challenge of a posture and determine the proper cor-
rection for your body’s own optimal form. Some people use a mirror to check 
the postures, but that only tells one side of the story and, more importantly, 
it externalizes the whole process too much.

38
Part I: Off to a Good Start with Yoga 
Become comfortable with checking from the inside, through inwardly feeling 
your body. Until you’re proficient at doing so, seek out a competent instructor 
if at all possible. He or she sees you objectively — from all sides — and can 
thus give you valuable feedback about your body’s specific resistances and 
requirements.
Being a Committed Yogi or Yogini
The traditional practice time for Yoga is 24 hours a day, as we discuss in 
Chapter 20. But even full-fledged yogis and yoginis don’t perform postures 
and other similar exercises for more than a few hours daily. (Of course, some 
of them don’t practice any physical exercises at all but pursue meditation 
exclusively.) Some people can carve out a regular Yoga practice time in their 
daily schedules. Many others, however, find this commitment completely 
impractical. Yet you can still benefit by attending classes just twice a week; 
even attending a group session once a week may introduce a little balance 
into a hectic lifestyle. You also have many opportunities during the day to 
work in a few Yoga postures or breathing exercises — during car rides or 
coffee breaks, or while going shopping.
How much time you allocate to your postural practice depends entirely on 
your goals and lifestyle. Inevitably, the busier you are with work, chores 
around the house, and social life, the less time you have available for Yoga. 
Consider starting with twice a week for a minimum of 15 minutes and see 
whether you can build to 30 minutes as a realistic goal in the first three 
months. If you’re able to dedicate more time to Yoga, try to practice daily. 
But set a realistic goal for yourself so that you don’t stress-out about Yoga 
or give up on it before you’re able to enjoy its benefits. Also, remember that 
even if you don’t have much time during the week, you can apply what you 
learn from each session anytime and anywhere!
The amount of time that you dedicate to Yoga is a personal choice — no 
need to feel guilty about your decision. Guilt is counterproductive and has no 
place in Yoga practice.
Eating before Yoga practice
Whether you’re taking a Yoga class or prac-
ticing on your own, the guidelines for eating 
before Yoga practice are similar to the advice 
given for most physical activities. With even 
the lightest meal, such as fruit or juice, allow 
at least one hour before class. For larger meals 
with vegetables and grains, allow two hours 
and for heavy meals with meat, three to four 
hours. Eating right after class is okay. You may 
even have worked up a good appetite.

I
n Yoga, what you do and how you do it are equally important, and both 
mind and body contribute to your actions. Yoga respects the fact that you 
aren’t merely a physical body but a psychophysical body-mind. Full mental 
participation in even the simplest of physical exercise enables you to tap into 
your deeper potential as a human being.
This chapter is about cultivating the right attitude toward your Yoga prac-
tice, which is the best preparation for success in Yoga. We encourage you to 
find your own pace without pushing yourself and risking injury, and to leave 
your competitive spirit to other endeavors. We also emphasize function over 
form, proposing that a modified version of the “ideal form” of a posture that 
suits your needs is the right form for you. Yoga is a creative endeavor that 
asks you to call upon the powers of your own mind as you explore and enjoy 
the possibilities.
Cultivating the Right Attitude
Attitudes are enduring tendencies in your mind that show themselves in your 
behavior as well as your speech. Yoga encourages you to examine all your 
basic attitudes toward life to discover which ones are dysfunctional so that 
you can replace them with more appropriate ones.

40
Part I: Off to a Good Start with Yoga 
One attitude worth cultivating is balance in everything, which is a top yogic 
virtue. A balanced attitude in this context means that you’re willing to build 
up your Yoga practice step by step instead of expecting instant perfection. It 
also means not basing your practice on incorrect assumptions, including the 
notion that Yoga is about tying yourself in knots. On the contrary, Yoga loosens 
all your bodily, emotional, and intellectual knots. The following sections give 
you some guidelines for getting in the right Yoga mindset.
Leave pretzels for snack time
Many people are turned off when they see magazine covers showing photo-
graphs of experts in advanced postures with their limbs tied in knots. What 
these publications may fail to disclose is that most of these yogis and yoginis 
have practiced Yoga several hours a day for many years to achieve their level 
of skill. Trust us! You don’t have to be a pretzel to experience the undeniable 
benefits of Yoga. The benefit you derive from Yoga is from practicing at a 
level appropriate for you and not from striking an advanced and “ideal” form.
More than 2,000 postures are possible in Yoga sports, one of five approaches 
we mention in Chapter 1; however, many of these poses call for such great 
strength and flexibility that only a top gymnast can perform them compe-
tently. Though these postures may look beautiful when mastered, they offer 
no greater health benefits than the 20 or so fundamental postures that make 
up most practitioners’ daily routines. So, unless you aim to participate in 
Yoga competitions, don’t worry about all those glamorous-looking postures. 
Most are new inventions, whereas Yoga masters have been content for centu-
ries with just a handful of practices that have stood the test of time.
What’s in a number?
The traditional Sanskrit texts of Hatha Yoga 
state that 8.4 million postures exist, which cor-
respond to as many species of living creatures. 
Of these, it’s said, only 84 are useful to humans, 
and 32 are especially important.
The number 84 has symbolic value and is the 
product of 12 × 7. The number 12 represents 
the fullness of a chronological cycle (as in 
the 12 months of the year, or the 12 signs of 
the zodiac). The number 7 stands for structural 
fullness (as in the 7 energy centers or cakras of 
the human body — see Chapter 20).

41
 Chapter 3: Prep Before Pep: Ensuring a Fruitful Yoga Practice
Practice at your own pace
Some people are natural pretzels. If you (like most) aren’t inherently noodle-
like, regular practice can increase your flexibility and muscular strength. We 
advocate a graduated approach. In Chapters 6 through 13, you can find all 
the preparatory and intermediary steps that lead up to the final forms for 
the various postures. The late Yoga master T.S. Krishnamacharya of Chennai 
(Madras), India, the source of most of the best-known orientations of modern 
Hatha Yoga, emphasized tailoring Yoga instruction to the needs of each indi-
vidual and advised Yoga teachers to take into account a student’s age, physi-
cal ability, emotional state, and occupation. We agree and offer this sound 
advice: Proceed gently, but steadfastly.
Note: If you like to learn Yoga from books, choose carefully. Do the exercise 
descriptions include all the stages of developing comfort with a particular 
posture? To ask a middle-aged newcomer to Yoga to imitate the final form 
of many of the postures without providing suitable transitions and adapta-
tions is a prescription for disaster. For instance, in almost every book on 
Hatha Yoga — except ours — you see the headstand featured quite promi-
nently. This posture has become something of a symbol for Yoga in the West. 
Headstands are powerful postures, to be sure, but they also count among the 
more advanced practices. Because this beginner’s book emphasizes exer-
cises that are both feasible and safe, we’ve chosen not to include the head-
stand. We say more about this decision in Chapter 10, which introduces safe 
inversion practices. Instead, we give you several adaptations that are easier 
to perform and have no risk attached to them.
Send the scorekeeper home
American children often grow up in a highly competitive environment. From 
childhood on, they’re pressured to do more, push harder, and win. Young 
athletes grow up with the spirit of competitiveness. Although competition 
has its place in society, this type of competitive behavior has no place in the 
practice of Yoga.
Yoga is about peace, tranquility, and harmony — the exact opposite of the 
competitive mindset. Yoga doesn’t require you to fight against anyone, least 
of all yourself, or to achieve some goal by force. On the contrary, you’re 
invited to be kind to yourself and others and, above all, to collaborate with 
your body rather than coerce it or do battle with your mind.

42
Part I: Off to a Good Start with Yoga 
Heed our cautionary tale: Many years ago, a middle-aged man came to one 
of our classes. He was a friendly enough fellow but extremely competitive 
and hard on himself. He announced right away that he was intent on master-
ing the lotus posture within a few weeks and pushed himself to do so during 
our classes. We urged him repeatedly to proceed more slowly. After only a 
few visits, he failed to show up and never returned. Later, we learned from a 
mutual friend that in his competitive zeal, he had asked his wife to sit on his 
legs to force them into the lotus posture. Her weight had seriously injured 
both his knees!
Picture yourself in the posture
We encourage you to use visualization in the execution of postures. For 
example, before you do the cobra, shoulder stand, or triangle, take ten sec-
onds or so to visualize yourself moving into the final posture. Make your visu-
alization as vivid as possible. Enlist the powers of your mind!
Enjoying a Peaceful Yoga Practice
As you travel through yogic postures, you begin to build awareness of the 
communications taking place between your body and mind. Do you feel 
peacefully removed from the raging storm of life around you, comfortable 
and confident with your strength, motion, and steadiness? Or are you pain-
fully noting the slow passage of time, sensing a physical awkwardness or 
strain in your movements? Listen to your own rhythms and acknowledge 
their importance to help make your Yoga experience an expression of peace, 
calm, and security. And that positive message is what Yoga practice is all 
about.
No pain, no gain — NOT!
The idea of no pain, no gain — a completely mis-
taken notion — often reinforces competitiveness. 
Although pain and discomfort are part of life, you 
don’t have to invite them. Yoga doesn’t ask you to 
be a masochist. On the contrary, the goal of Yoga 
is to overcome all suffering. Therefore, never flog 
your body; always only coax it gently. Our motto 
is no gain from pain.

43
 Chapter 3: Prep Before Pep: Ensuring a Fruitful Yoga Practice
Busting the perfect posture myth
Some modern schools of Hatha Yoga claim that they teach “perfect” postures 
that you can slip into as easily as a tailor-made suit. But how can the same 
posture be perfect for both a 15-year-old athlete and a 60-year-old retiree? 
Besides, these schools disagree among themselves about what constitutes a 
perfect posture. So, to spell it out, the perfect posture is a perfect myth.
As the great Yoga master Patanjali explained nearly 2,000 years ago, posture 
has only two requirements: A posture should be steady and easeful:
 
✓ Steady posture: A steady posture is a posture that you hold stable for 
a certain period of time. The key isn’t freezing all movement, though. 
Your posture becomes steady when your mind is steady. As long as your 
thoughts run wild, including your negative emotions, your body also 
remains unsteady. As you become more skilled in self-observation, you 
begin to notice the ever-revolving carousel of your mind and become 
sensitive to the tension in your body. That tension is what Yoga means 
by unsteadiness.
 
✓ Easeful posture: A posture is easeful when it’s enjoyable and enlivening 
rather than boring and burdensome. An easeful posture increases the 
principle of clarity — sattva — in you. But easefulness isn’t slouching. 
Sattva and joy are intimately connected. The more sattva is present in 
your body-mind, the more relaxed and happy you will be.
Although Patanjali was thinking primarily, perhaps even exclusively, in terms 
of meditation postures, his formula applies to all postures equally.
Listening to your body
No one knows your body like you do. The more you practice Yoga, the better 
you can become at determining your limitations, as well as your strengths, 
with each posture. Each posture presents its own unique challenge. You 
want to feel encouraged to explore and expand your physical and emotional 
boundaries without risking strain or injury to yourself.
Some teachers speak of practicing at the edge, the point at which the inten-
sity of a posture challenges you but doesn’t cause you pain or unusual dis-
comfort. The idea is to very slowly and carefully push that edge farther back 
and open up new territory. Cultivate self-observation and pay attention to the 
feedback from your body to be able to practice at the edge.

Part I: Off to a Good Start with Yoga 
 
Each Yoga session is an exercise in self-observation without being judgmental. 
Listen to what your body is telling you. Train yourself to become aware of the 
signals that continually travel from your muscles, tendons, ligaments, bones, 
and skin to your brain. Be in dialogue with your body instead of indulging in a 
mental monologue that excludes bodily awareness. Pay particular attention to 
signals coming from your neck, lower back, jaw muscles, abdomen, and any 
known problem areas of your body.
To gauge the intensity of a difficult Yoga posture, use a scale from one to 
ten, with ten being your threshold for tolerable pain. Imagine a flashing 
red light and an alarm bell going off after you pass level eight. Notice the 
signals and heed them, particularly your breath. If your breathing becomes 
labored, it usually indicates that, figuratively speaking, you’re going over 
the edge. You’re the world’s foremost expert on what your body is trying 
to tell you.
Beginners commonly experience trembling when holding certain Yoga pos-
tures. Normally, the involuntary motion is noticeable in the legs or arms and 
is nothing to worry about, as long as you aren’t straining. The tremors are 
simply a sign that your muscles are working in response to a new demand. 
Instead of focusing on the feeling that you’ve become a wobbly bowl of jelly, 
lengthen your breath a little if you can and allow your attention to go deeper 
within. If the trembling starts to go off the Richter scale, either ease up a little 
or end the posture altogether.
Moving slowly but surely
All postural movements are intended for slow performance. Unfortunately, 
most people are usually on automatic with movements that tend to be uncon-
scious, too fast, and not particularly graceful. Most people are generally 
unaware of their bodies, but yogic postures lead you to adopt a different atti-
tude. Among the advantages of slow motion are
 
✓ Enhanced awareness, which enables you to listen to what your body is 
telling you and to practice at the edge.
 
✓ Safer practice. Slowing down lowers the risk of straining or spraining 
muscles, tearing ligaments, or overtaxing your heart.
 
✓ Quicker relaxation.
 
✓ Improved breathing and breathing stamina.
 
✓ Shared workload among more muscle groups.

45
 Chapter 3: Prep Before Pep: Ensuring a Fruitful Yoga Practice
For the best results, practice your postures at a slow, steady pace while 
calmly focusing on your breath and the postural movement (flip to Chapter 5 
for more info on breathing and movement). Resist the temptation to speed 
up; rather, savor each posture. Relax and be present here and now. If your 
breathing becomes labored or you begin to feel fatigued, rest until you’re 
ready to go on.
If you find yourself rushing through your program, pause and ask yourself, 
“Why the hurry?” If you’re truly short on time, shorten your program and 
focus on fewer postures. But if you just can’t shake the feeling of being pres-
sured by time, consider postponing your Yoga session altogether and prac-
tice conscious breathing (which we discuss in Chapter 5) while you go about 
your other business.
If you’re rushing through your program because you’re feeling bored or 
generally distracted, pause and remind yourself why you’re practicing 
Yoga in the first place. Renew your motivation by telling yourself that you 
have plenty of time to complete your session. Boredom is a sign that you’re 
detached from your own bodily experience and aren’t living in the present 
moment. Participate fully in the process. If you need more than a mental 
reminder, use one of the relaxation techniques that we describe in Chapter 4 
to slow yourself down. As we explain in Chapter 5, full yogic breathing in one 
of the resting postures also has a wonderful calming effect.
Practicing function over form 
with Forgiving Limbs
In Yoga, as in life, function is more important than form. It’s the function and 
not the form of the posture that gives you its benefits. Beginners, in particu-
lar need to adapt postures to enjoy their function and benefits right from the 
start.
We call one very useful adaptive device Forgiving Limbs. With Forgiving 
Limbs, you give yourself permission to slightly bend your legs and arms 
instead of keeping them fully extended. Bent arms and legs enable you to 
move your spine more easily, which is the focus of many postures and the 
key to a healthy spine.
For example, the primary mechanical function of a standing forward bend is 
to stretch your lower back. If you have a good back, take a moment to see 
what we mean in this adapted posture that’s safe for beginners:

46
Part I: Off to a Good Start with Yoga 
 
1. Stand up straight and without forcing anything, bend forward and try 
to place your head on your knees with the palms of your hands on the 
floor (see Figure 3-1a) or hold the backs of your ankles.
 
 Very few men or women can actually do this, especially beginners.
 
2. Now stand up again, separate your feet to hip width, and bend for-
ward, allowing your legs to bend until you can place your hands on 
the floor and almost touch your head to your knees (see Figure 3-1b).
 
When bending forward, be sure not to bounce up and down as most people 
are inclined to do. You’re not a bungee cord!
As you become more flexible — and you will! — gradually straighten your 
legs until you can come closer to the ideal posture. A common lower back 
injury occurs when weekend warriors inspired by young, nubile instructors 
try to do the seated version of the straight-legged forward bend and push 
too far.

The Fine Art of Letting Go of Stress
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding and dealing with stress
▶ Relaxing the body through mental and physical exercises
L
ife in general — not merely modern life — is inherently stressful. Even 
an inanimate object such as a rock can experience an element of stress. 
Not all stress is bad for you, however. The question is whether that stress is 
helping you or killing you.
Psychologists distinguish between distress and eustress (good stress). Yoga can 
help you minimize distress and maximize good, life-enhancing stress. For exam-
ple, a creative challenge that stimulates your imagination and fires your enthu-
siasm but doesn’t cause you anxiety or lost sleep is a positive event. Even a 
joyous celebration is, strictly speaking, stressful, but the celebration isn’t the 
kind of stress that kills you — at least not in modest doses. On the other hand, 
doing nothing and feeling bored to tears is a form of negative stress.
In this chapter, we talk about how you can control negative stress not only 
through various yogic-relaxation techniques but also by cultivating appropri-
ate attitudes and habits.
The Nature of Stress
Stress is a fact of life. Some estimates indicate that 80 percent of all illnesses 
result from stress. Endocrinologist Hans Selye, who pioneered stress research, 
distinguished three phases of the stress syndrome: alarm, resistance, and 
exhaustion. Alarm can be a harmless activity like stepping from a warm house 
into the cold air or receiving an upsetting phone call. Both situations require the 

48
Part I: Off to a Good Start with Yoga 
body to make an adjustment, which is a kind of resistance. When the demand on 
the body goes on for too long, the stage of exhaustion sets in, which can lead to a 
complete breakdown of the body and the mind — be it heart disease, hyperten-
sion, failure of the immune system, or mental illness.
 
Bad stress creates an imbalance in the body and the mind, causing you to 
tense your muscles and breathe in a rapid and shallow manner. Under stress, 
your adrenal glands work overtime and your blood becomes depleted of 
oxygen, which starves your cells. Constant stress triggers the fight-or-flight 
response, putting you in a chronic state of alertness that’s extremely demand-
ing on your body’s energies.
Because of the relentless demands of modern life — work, noise, pollution, 
and so on — most people experience chronic stress. How can you deal with it 
efficiently? Yoga suggests a three-pronged solution:
 
✓ Correct stress-producing attitudes.
 
✓ Change habits that invite stress into your life.
 
✓ Release existing tension in the body on an ongoing basis.
 
Stress can occur without any unpleasant stimulus. Even a birthday celebration 
can cause you stress, usually because of some hidden anxiety (like another 
year to mark off). Stress is cumulative and can creep up on you so gradually 
that it’s imperceptible — until its acute and adverse symptoms manifest.
Correcting wrong attitudes
Yoga’s integrated approach works with both the body and the mind, offering 
potent antidotes to just the sort of attitudes that make you prone to stress, 
especially egotism, extreme competitiveness, perfectionism, and the sense 
of having to accomplish everything right now and by yourself. In all matters, 
Yoga seeks to replace negative thoughts and attitudes with positive mental 
dispositions; it asks you to be kind to yourself. Yogic practice helps you 
understand that everything has its proper place and time.
If you, like so many stress sufferers, have a hard time asking for help, Yoga 
can give you a real appreciation that everyone is interdependent. If you’re 
by nature distrustful of others, Yoga puts you in touch with that part of your 
psyche that naturally trusts life itself. It shows you that you don’t need to feel 
as if you’re under attack, because your real life — your spiritual identity — 
can never be harmed or destroyed.

 Chapter 4: Relaxed Like a Noodle: The Fine Art of Letting Go of Stress
Changing poor habits
Everything in the universe follows an ebb-and-flow pattern that you can 
count on. Seasons change, and newborn babies eventually become elderly 
adults. Yogic wisdom recommends that you adopt the same natural patterns 
into your personal life. You may spend much of your time being serious, 
but you need to play, too. In fact, you need to make time to just be with no 
expectations and no guilt. Taking time to just be is good for your physical 
and mental health. Work and rest, tension and relaxation belong together as 
balanced pairs.
Often, people desperately maintain a hectic schedule because they can’t 
envision an alternative that includes time out. They fear what may happen if 
they slow down. But money and standard of living aren’t everything, and the 
quality of your life is far more important. Besides, if stress undercuts your 
health, you have to go into low gear anyway, and your climb back to health 
may prove very costly. Yoga gives you a baseline of tranquility to deal with 
your fears effectively, providing that you engage it at the mental level and not 
just the physical level.
Your inner wisdom tells you that your body and mind are subject to 
change and that nothing in your environment permanently stays the same. 
Therefore, there’s no point in anxiously clinging to anything. Yoga recom-
mends that you constantly remember your spiritual nature, which is beyond 
the realm of change and ever blissful. However, it also asks you to care for 
others and the world you live in, but all the while appreciating that you can’t 
step into the same river twice.
Wherever ego, I go
The ultimate source of stress is the ego, or what 
the Yoga masters call the “I-maker” (aham-
kara), from aham (“I”) and kara (“maker”). 
From the perspective of Yoga, the ego is a mis-
taken notion in which people identify with their 
particular bodies rather than the universe as 
a whole. Consequently, they experience fear 
of death and attachment to the body and the 
mind. This attachment, which is the survival 
instinct, in turn gives rise to all those many emo-
tions and intentions that make up the game of 
life. Keeping this artificial center — the ego — 
going is inherently stressful. The Yoga masters 
all agree that by relaxing the grip of the ego, you 
can experience greater peace and happiness. 
Happy letting go!

For example, if you’re a mother, you love and take tender care of your chil-
dren. But if you’re also a yogini, you don’t succumb to the stress-producing 
illusion that you own your children. Instead, you always remain aware of the 
fact that your sons and daughters have their own lives to live, which may 
turn out to be quite different from yours, and that all you can do is guide 
them as best you can.
Of course, you can do many practical things, which are described in books 
on stress management, to reduce stressful situations. These suggestions 
include not waiting until the last minute to start or finish projects, improving 
your communication with others, avoiding confrontations, and accepting that 
we live in an imperfect world.
 
Your daily Hatha Yoga routine, especially the relaxation exercises, can help 
you extend the feeling of peacefulness or calmness beyond the session to 
the rest of the day. Pick some activities or situations that you repeat several 
times a day as reminders to consciously relax, such as when you go to the 
bathroom, wait at a traffic light, sit down, open or close a door, look at your 
watch, or hang up the telephone. Whenever you encounter these activities, 
exhale deeply and consciously relax, remembering the peaceful feeling evoked 
in your daily session.
Detach yourself
Yoga shows you how to cultivate the relaxation 
response throughout the day by letting go of 
your hold on things. This phrase was coined by 
Herbert Benson, MD, who was among the first 
to point out the hidden epidemic of hypertension 
(high blood pressure) as a result of stress. In his 
#1 national bestseller The Relaxation Response 
(Harper Paperbacks), he calls the relaxation 
response “a universal human capacity” and “a 
remarkable innate, neglected asset.”
Yoga teaches you how to tap into that under-
used capacity of your own body-mind. The 
yogic equivalent of the relaxation response is 
vairagya, which means literally “dispassion” 
or “nonattachment.” We call it “letting go.” 
Feeling passionate about what you do (rather 
than having a lukewarm attitude) is good, but at 
the same time, you merely invite suffering when 
you become too attached to people, situations, 
and the outcome of your actions. For most 
people, this lesson is difficult to learn; it’s pretty 
much a lifelong lesson. You can start any time, 
but the best time to begin is now.
Yoga recommends an attitude of inner detach-
ment in all matters. This detachment doesn’t 
spring from boredom, failure, fear, or any 
neurotic attitude but from inner wisdom. 
Unfortunately, you can’t turn on some tap to 
pour forth wisdom whenever you want it. You 
must acquire wisdom, either bit by bit as life 
presents opportunities or deliberately through 
an intelligent study of the yogic tradition. The 
latter approach can involve listening directly to 
the teachings of bona fide masters or studying 
the same teachings in book form. Yoga’s tradi-
tional teachings are contained in many books — 
all translated from the Sanskrit language for the 
benefit of contemporary students.

 Chapter 4: Relaxed Like a Noodle: The Fine Art of Letting Go of Stress
Releasing bodily tension
Yoga pursues tension release through all its many different techniques, 
including breathing exercises and postures, but especially relaxation tech-
niques. The former are a form of active or dynamic relaxation, the latter are a 
form of passive or receptive relaxation.
Relaxation Techniques That Work
The Sanskrit word for relaxation is shaithilya, which is pronounced shy-theel-
yah and means “loosening.” It refers to the loosening of bodily and mental 
tension — all the knots that you tie when you don’t go with the flow of life. 
These knots are like kinks in a hose that prevent the water from flowing 
freely. Keeping muscles in a constant alert state expends a great amount of 
your energy, which then is unavailable when you call upon your muscles to 
really function. Conscious relaxation trains your muscles to release their grip 
when you don’t use them. This relaxation keeps the muscles responsive to 
the signals from your brain telling them to contract so that you can perform 
all the countless tasks of a busy day.
Tips for a successful relaxation practice
Relaxation isn’t quite the same as doing nothing. Often, when you believe 
you’re doing nothing, you’re actually busy contracting unused muscles quite 
unconsciously. Relaxation is a conscious endeavor that lies somewhere 
between effort and noneffort. To truly relax, you have to understand and 
practice the skill.
 
Relaxation doesn’t require any gadgets, but you may want to try the following:
 
✓ Practice in a quiet environment where you’re unlikely to be disturbed by 
others or the telephone.
 
✓ Try placing a small pillow under your head and a large one under 
your knees for support and comfort in the supine, or lying, positions. 
Alternatively, fold up a blanket.
 
✓ Ensure that your body stays warm. If necessary, heat the room first or 
cover yourself with a blanket. Particularly avoid lying on a cold floor, 
which isn’t good for your kidneys.
 
✓ Don’t practice relaxation techniques on a full stomach.

Deep relaxation: The corpse posture
The simplest and yet the most difficult of all Yoga postures is the corpse pos-
ture (shavasana, from shava and asana, pronounced shah-vah sah-nah), also 
widely known as the dead posture (mritasana, from mrita and asana). This 
posture is the simplest because you don’t have to use any part of your body 
at all, and it’s the most difficult precisely because you’re asked to do nothing 
whatsoever with your limbs. The corpse posture is an exercise in mind over 
matter. The only props you need are your body and mind.
 
If you’re high-strung, asana practice helps make the corpse posture more 
easily accessible.
 
Here’s how you do the corpse posture:
 
1. Lie flat on your back, with your arms stretched out and relaxed by 
your sides, palms up (or whatever feels most comfortable).
 
 Place a small pillow or folded blanket under your head if you need one 
and another large one under your knees for added comfort.
 
2. Close your eyes.
 
 Check out Figure 4-1 for a look at the corpse posture.
 
3. Form a clear intention to relax.
 
 Some people find picturing themselves lying in white sand on a sunny 
beach helpful.
 
4. Take a couple of deep breaths, lengthening exhalation.
 
5. Contract the muscles in your feet for a couple of seconds and then 
consciously relax them.
 
 Do the same with the muscles in your calves, upper legs, buttocks, abdo-
men, chest, back, hands, forearms, upper arms, shoulders, neck, and face.
 
6. Periodically scan all your muscles from your feet to your face to check 
that they’re relaxed.
 
 You can often detect subtle tension around the eyes and the scalp mus-
cles. Also relax your mouth and tongue.
 
7. Focus on the growing bodily sensation of no tension and let your 
breath be free.
 
8. At the end of the session, before opening your eyes, form the inten-
tion to keep the relaxed feeling for as long as possible.
 
9. Open your eyes, stretch lazily, and get up slowly.
Practice 10 to 30 minutes; the longer the duration, the better. But watch out! 
Relaxing for too long can make you drowsy.

Ending relaxation peacefully
Allowing relaxation to end on its own is best — your body knows when it has 
benefited sufficiently and naturally brings you out of relaxation. However, if 
you have only a limited time for the exercise, set your mental clock to 15, 20, 
or however many minutes after closing your eyes as part of your intention.
 
If you need to have a sound to remind you to return to ordinary waking con-
sciousness, make sure that your wristwatch or clock isn’t so loud that it star-
tles you and provokes a heavy surge of adrenaline.
Staying awake during relaxation
If it looks like you’re going to fall asleep while doing the corpse posture, try 
bringing your feet closer together. Also, periodically pay attention to your 
breathing, making sure it’s even and unforced. Catnaps are generally excel-
lent; if you’re experiencing insomnia, however, we suggest you save your 
sleep until you go to bed at night. (For good anti-insomnia exercises, check 
out “Relaxation before sleep” and “Insomnia buster” later in this section.) In 
any case, the benefits of conscious relaxation are more profound than any 
catnap. The beautiful thing about relaxation is that you’re conscious through-
out the experience and can control it to some extent. Through relaxation, you 
become more in touch with your own body, which benefits you throughout 
the day: You can detect stress and tension in your body more readily and 
then take remedial action. Also, you avoid the risk of feeling drowsy after-
ward because you inadvertently entered into a deeper sleep. Remember that 
sleep isn’t necessarily relaxing. That’s why people sometimes wake up feeling 
like they’ve done heavy work in their sleep.
Afternoon delight
When your energies flag in the afternoon, try the following exercise, which 
is a great stress buster. You can practice it at home or in a quiet place at the 
office. Just make sure that you can’t be interrupted. For this exercise, you need 

54
Part I: Off to a Good Start with Yoga 
a sturdy chair, one or two blankets, and a towel or an eye bag (see Chapter 19 
for more on this additional yoga resource). Allow five to ten minutes.
 
1. Lie on your back and put your feet up on the chair, which should face 
you (see Figure 4-2).
 
 Make sure that your legs and back are comfortable. Your legs should 
be 15 to 18 inches apart. You can also put your legs and feet up on the 
edge of a bed. If none of the feet-up positions feels good, just lie on your 
back with your legs bent and feet placed on the floor. If the back of your 
head isn’t flat on the floor, and your neck and throat feel tense, or if your 
chin is pushed up toward the ceiling, raise your head slightly on a folded 
blanket or firm flat cushion to feel comfortable.
 
Figure 4-2: 
Lie on your 
back and 
put your feet 
on a chair.
 
 
2. Cover your body from the neck down with one of the blankets.
 
 Don’t let your body cool down too quickly, which can not only feel 
uncomfortable and interfere with your relaxation but also cramp your 
muscles and harm your kidneys.
 
3. Place the eye bag or towel folded lengthwise over your eyes.
 
4. Rest for a few moments and get used to the position.
 
5. Visualize a large balloon in your stomach. As you inhale through your 
nose, expand the imaginary balloon in all directions. As you exhale 
through your nose, release the air from the balloon.
 
 Repeat this step several times until it becomes easy for you.
 
6. Inhale freely and begin to make your exhalation longer and longer.
 
 Inhale freely, exhale forever.
 
7. Repeat Step 6 at least 30 times.

55
 Chapter 4: Relaxed Like a Noodle: The Fine Art of Letting Go of Stress
 
8. When you finish the exercise, allow your breath to return to normal 
and rest for a minute or so, enjoying the relaxed feeling.
 
 Don’t rush getting up.
Magic triangles
The following relaxation technique utilizes your power of imagination. If you 
can picture things easily in your mind, you may find the exercise enjoyable 
and refreshing. For this exercise, you need a chair and a blanket (if necessary). 
Allow five minutes.
 
1. Sit up tall in a chair, with your feet on the floor and comfortably apart 
and your hands resting on top of your knees as shown in Figure 4-3.
 
 If your feet aren’t comfortably touching the floor, fold up the blanket and 
place it under your feet for support.
 
Figure 4-3: 
Sit with your 
feet on the 
floor and 
your hands 
on your 
knees.
 
 
2. Breathe through your nose but allow your breath to move freely.
 
3. Close your eyes and focus your attention on the middle of your fore-
head, just above the level of your eyebrows.
 
 Make sure that you don’t crinkle your forehead or squint your eyes.
 
4. Visualize as vividly as possible a triangle connecting the forehead 
point and the palms of both hands.
 
 Register (but don’t think about) any sensations or colors that appear 
on your mental screen while you hold the triangle in your mind. Do this 
visualization for 8 to 10 breaths and then dissolve the triangle.

56
Part I: Off to a Good Start with Yoga 
 
5. Visualize a triangle formed by your navel and the big toes of your feet.
 
 Retain this image for 10 to 12 breaths. If any part of the mental triangle is 
difficult to connect, keep focusing on that part until the triangle fully forms.
 
6. Keeping your eyes closed, visualize again the first triangle formed 
between your forehead and your two palms and then simultaneously 
visualize the second triangle (navel to toes).
 
 This final step is more challenging. Picture both triangles together for 12 
to 15 breaths and then dissolve them.
Relaxation before sleep
If you want to enjoy deep sleep or are experiencing insomnia (but don’t want 
to count sheep), the following exercise can help you. Many people don’t 
make it to the end of this relaxation technique without falling asleep. For this 
exercise, you need the following props: a bed or other comfortable place to 
sleep, two pillows, and one or two blankets. Allow five to ten minutes.
 
1. Prepare yourself for sleep and get into bed, lying on your back under 
the blankets.
 
 Your legs can be straight or bent at the knees with your feet flat on the 
mattress.
 
2. Place one pillow or folded blanket under your head and have the 
other one close by.
 
3. With your eyes closed, begin to breathe through the nose, making 
your exhalation twice as long as your inhalation.
 
 Keep your breathing smooth and effortless. Also, don’t try to direct your 
breath to any part of your body. Let the breathing pattern be effortless, 
something you can keep up.
 
4. Remain on your back for eight breaths and then roll over onto your 
right side and place the second pillow between your knees.
 
 Now use the same breathing ratio from Step 3 for 16 breaths.
 
5. Finally, roll over on to your left side, with the second pillow still 
between your knees, and use the breathing ratio for 32 breaths.
Insomnia buster
This exercise is for those who suffer from insomnia but have an active imagi-
nation. Instead of watching your mind weave tale after tale when you can’t 
sleep at night, why not recruit your imagination for the purpose of falling 
soundly asleep? Here’s how.

Insomnia
Over 100 million North Americans suffer from 
chronic sleeplessness for medical, psychologi-
cal, social, or environmental reasons. A medi-
cal cause may be a diagnosed or undiagnosed 
chronic disease, a temporary illness (such as 
the flu), pain, or reaction to a remedy. A psycho-
logical cause may be general anxiety, depres-
sion, anger, or alertness (such as expecting to 
be awakened by your baby). A social cause may 
be the habit of going to bed too late or having 
a late meal. An environmental cause may be a 
noisy neighborhood or a toxic home.
Obviously, you want to rule out interference from 
a chronic disease or reaction to a medication, so 
if need be, consult a physician or a pharmacist. 
You know whether you’re anxious, depressed, 
or overly alert and whether your social habits 
are or aren’t conducive to your sleep and well-
being. But here are some sleep habits that rep-
resent their own obstacle to a good night’s rest:
 ✓ Being fearful about insomnia by entertain-
ing such misconceived notions that if you 
don’t sleep eight hours every day you will 
die, go literally crazy, or become totally 
inefficient. Generally, these extremes don’t 
happen. These mental expectations pro-
gram your body to fulfill your own proph-
ecies. More often than not, insomniacs 
sleep many more hours than they think. 
Especially, older folks who swear that they 
haven’t slept a wink in days can be found 
happily snoozing after lunch or another 
time during the day.
 ✓ Anxiously watching the clock. The best 
thing is to place your clock where you can’t 
see or reach it.
To combat insomnia, cultivate the following:
 ✓ Make peace with yourself and everyone 
else when getting ready for sleep. That’s a 
good habit anyway.
 ✓ Don’t force yourself to sleep. That’s where 
knowing your personal diurnal (daytime) 
rhythm comes in handy. Some people 
are naturally sleepy by 9 p.m., but others 
have a few more hours of activity in them 
because they rise a bit later. If you go to 
bed two hours too early, you shouldn’t be 
surprised if you just lie awake counting 
sheep. Acquaint yourself with your body’s 
unique rhythm or, rather, rhythms.
 ✓ Get enough physical exercise. Yoga should 
do the trick!
 ✓ Don’t nap during the day.
 ✓ Avoid non-sleep activities (TV watching, 
reading, eating, and so on) in bed.
 ✓ Go to bed at the same time. Make this a 
force of good habit.
 ✓ Get up if you can’t sleep and sit in another 
room. Try going to bed again when you feel 
sleepy. Do this change of scenery as often 
as necessary instead of tormenting yourself 
in bed for hours on end.
 ✓ Cut an hour off your regular eight-hour 
sleeping time. Reducing your normal 
amount of sleep makes you that much more 
ready to sleep the next night.
We counsel against taking sleeping pills. They 
condition the body wrongly. If you feel that you 
need to take sleep aids, give herbal oils (mas-
saged into the feet or the whole body), acu-
pressure, or homeopathy a try. But many Yoga 
practitioners have found a significant improve-
ment of their insomnia just after a few weeks of 
regular daily practice.

If you’re claustrophobic, this exercise may not necessarily work for you. But 
before giving up, you may first want to try evoking feelings of security and 
comfort, as in a mother’s womb.
 
1. Prepare yourself for sleep and lie down comfortably in bed in any 
position.
 
2. With closed eyes, breathe evenly through your nose for a while.
 
3. Now visualize yourself snugly enfolded in a protective cocoon of 
purple color.
 
4. While feeling safe in your purple environment, visualize a thin line 
of white light extending from the crown of your head to your solar 
plexus, just below your navel.
This technique works even while traveling on a plane with the jets roaring 
next to your ears. Just tell the flight attendant not to disturb you while you’re 
sleeping.
Yoga Nidra (Yogic Sleep)
If your body-mind is slow to wind down to get its well-deserved rest, here’s a 
potent technique to catch up on your sleep quotient by enticing Mr. Sandman 
to visit you regularly. Yogic Sleep is a very powerful relaxation technique that 
you can do after you gain some control over the relaxation response (which 
we discuss in the earlier “Detach yourself” sidebar). When practiced suc-
cessfully, this technique is as restorative as sleep — except you remain fully 
aware throughout.
To induce Yoga Nidra, you must listen to a set of instructions, similar to 
guided meditation. You can listen to a friend reading the instructions, but lis-
tening to a recording by someone else or by you yourself is more practical.
One feature of this practice is to focus in relatively quick succession on indi-
vidual parts of the body. Mentally name each part and then sense it as dis-
tinctly as possible.
 
In the beginning, you may find actually feeling certain body parts difficult. 
Don’t let this setback dismay you; continue to rotate your awareness fairly 
swiftly. With practice, you can include in this circuit even the inner organs and 
all kinds of mental states.
Practicing Yoga Nidra before sleep is best because it’s an excellent technique 
for inducing lucid dreaming and out-of-the-body experiences during sleep. 
Lucid dreaming refers to the kind of dream in which you’re aware that you’re 
dreaming. Great Yoga masters remain aware even during deep sleep. Only 
the body and brain are fast asleep, whereas awareness is continuous.

 Chapter 4: Relaxed Like a Noodle: The Fine Art of Letting Go of Stress
Formulating your intention
Yoga Nidra serves as a potent tool for reprogramming your brain. If you do 
it correctly, it can accelerate your inner or spiritual growth. It allows you to 
cultivate good habits and attitudes. First consider which specific habit or 
attitude you really want to replace with a more positive habit or attitude. 
This phase is called formulating your intention. Take your time to consider 
what you want to change about yourself.
Phrase your chosen intention in the following way: I will become more this 
or that. This wording affirms your life’s future trajectory by enlisting the 
unconscious mind. Worthy intentions may be to become more patient, more 
tolerant, or more loving. We recommend that whatever intention you choose 
doesn’t contradict any of Yoga’s high moral virtues, which we discuss in 
Chapter 20. Also, make your intention realistic and specific. An intention like 
“I will become enlightened” is specific enough but perhaps not very realistic. 
By contrast, an intention like “I will become a better person” is too vague. 
A better intention is something more along the lines of “I will become more 
relaxed within myself,” “I will become more tolerant toward others,” or “I 
will become more patient.” You want your intention to be something you can 
stick with until you realize it in your life rather than one you have to abandon 
because it was too lofty or undefined.
 
When formulating your intention, try to evoke the corresponding feeling inside 
you so you know what it feels like to be loving, patient, forgiving, or whatever.
After you set an intention, you formally apply it during the actual Yoga Nidra 
exercise (described in the following section) by repeating it when prompted.
Performing Yoga Nidra
The following steps show you how to perform Yoga Nidra:
 
1. Choose a clear intention (as described in the preceding section) and 
lie flat on your back, with your arms stretched out by your sides (or 
whatever feels most comfortable).
 
 Place a pillow or folded blanket behind your neck for support and 
another pillow or folded blanket under your knees for added comfort. 
Refer to Figure 4-1 earlier in the chapter.
 
2. Close your eyes.
 
3. Repeat the clear intention you chose in Step 1 three times.
 
4. Take a couple of deep breaths, emphasizing exhalation.

60
Part I: Off to a Good Start with Yoga 
 
5. Starting with your right side, rotate your awareness through all parts 
on that side of your body — limb by limb — in fairly quick succession.
 
 Follow this progression: each finger, palm of the hand, back of the hand, 
the hand as a whole, forearm, elbow, upper arm, shoulder joint, shoul-
der, neck, each section of the face (forehead, eyes, nose, chin, and so 
on), ear, scalp, throat, chest, side of the rib cage, shoulder blade, waist, 
stomach, lower abdomen, genitals, buttocks, whole spine, thigh, top and 
back of knee, shin, calf, ankle, top of foot, heel, sole, each toe.
 
6. Be aware of your body as a whole.
 
7. Repeat the rotation in Step 5 on the left side, ending with the whole-
body awareness as described in Step 6.
 
8. Repeat Steps 5 through 7 one or more times until you achieve an ade-
quate level of relaxation.
 
9. Continue to be aware of the whole body and the space surrounding it, 
feeling the stillness and peace.
 
10. Reaffirm your initial intention three times.
 
11. Mentally prepare to return to ordinary consciousness.
 
12. Gently move your fingers for a few moments, take a deep breath, and 
then open your eyes.
No time limit applies to your Yoga Nidra performance, unless you impose 
one. Expect to come out of Yogic Sleep naturally, whether you return after 
only 15 minutes or a whole hour. Or you may just fall asleep. So if you have 
things to do afterward, make sure you set your wristwatch or clock for a 
gentle wake-up call. Don’t rush up! Take your time to reintegrate with the 
ordinary world.
 
I (Georg) swear by this practice. It’s the most powerful yogic technique for 
personal change at the beginner level. Only the ecstatic state (samadhi) is 
more transformative. Several good recordings for practicing Yoga Nidra are 
available, but don’t be surprised to discover that the instructions vary from 
recording to recording. For our choice, see the appendix.

T
he masters of Yoga discovered the usefulness of the breath thousands of 
years ago and in Hatha Yoga have perfected a system for the conscious con-
trol of breathing; in this chapter, we share their secrets with you. In the ancient 
Sanskrit language, the word for breath is the same as the word for life — prana 
(pronounced prah-nah) — which gives you a good clue about how important 
Yoga thinks breathing is for your well-being. Yoga without prana is like putting 
an empty pot on the stove and hoping for a delicious meal. In this chapter, we 
show you how to use conscious breathing in conjunction with the Yoga pos-
tures, and we also introduce several breathing exercises that you do seated 
either on a chair or in one of the Yoga sitting postures (if you’re up to that).
Breathing Your Way to Good Health
Think of your breath as your most intimate friend. Your breath is with you 
from the moment you’re born until you die. In a given day, you take be-
tween 20,000 and 30,000 breaths. Most likely, barring any respiratory prob-
lems, you’re barely aware of your breathing. This state is akin to taking your 
best friend so for granted that the relationship gets stale and is put at risk. 
Although the automatic nature of breathing is part of the body’s machinery 
that keeps you alive, having breathing occur automatically isn’t necessarily 
to your advantage; automatic doesn’t always mean optimal. In fact, most 
people’s breathing habits are quite poor and to their great disadvantage. 
Stale air accumulates in their lungs and becomes as unproductive as a stale 
friendship. Poor breathing is known to cause and increase stress. Conversely, 
stress shortens your breath and increases your level of anxiety.

62
Part I: Off to a Good Start with Yoga 
You can help alleviate stress through the simple practice of yogic breath-
ing. Among other things, breathing loads your blood with oxygen, which, 
by nourishing and repairing your body’s cells, maintains your health at the 
most desirable level. Shallow breathing, which is common, doesn’t oxygenate 
the ten pints of blood circulating in your arteries and veins very efficiently. 
Consequently, toxins accumulate in the cells. Before you know it, you feel 
mentally sluggish and emotionally down, and eventually organs begin to 
malfunction. Is it any wonder that the breath is the best tool you have to pro-
foundly affect your body and mind?
 
Bad breath is improved by brushing your teeth regularly and occasionally 
sucking on a mint. Bad breathing, however, is a bad habit that requires a bit 
more to change: You must retrain your body through breath awareness.
In Yoga, consciously regulated breathing has three major applications. Use it
 
✓ In conjunction with the various postures to achieve the deepest possible 
effect and to prepare the mind for meditation.
 
✓ As breath control (called pranayama, pronounced prah-nah-yah-mah) to 
invigorate your vitality.
 
✓ As a healing method in which you consciously direct the breath to a 
particular part or organ of the body to remove energetic blockages and 
facilitate healing. This practice is Yoga’s gentle version of acupuncture.
Taking high-quality breaths
Before you jump right in and make drastic changes to your method of breath-
ing, take a few minutes to assess your current breathing style. You may find 
it helpful to keep a log of your breathing habits over the course of a couple of 
days, noting how your breathing changes in accordance with the situations 
around you and your states of mind. Check your breathing by asking yourself 
the following questions:
 
✓ Is my breathing shallow (my abdomen and chest barely move when I fill 
my lungs with air)?
 
✓ Do I often breathe erratically (my breathing rhythm isn’t harmonious)?
 
✓ Do I easily get out of breath?
 
✓ Is my breathing labored at times?
 
✓ Do I hold my breath in stressful situations?
 
✓ Do I generally breathe too fast?
If your answer to any of these questions is yes, you make an ideal candidate 
for yogic breathing. Even if you didn’t answer yes, practicing conscious 
breathing still benefits your mind and body.

63
 Chapter 5: Breath and Movement Simplified
 
Men take an average of 12 to 14 breaths per minute, and women take 14 
to 15. Breathing at a markedly faster pace — usually associated with chest 
breathing — qualifies as hyperventilation, which leads to carbon dioxide 
depletion (your body needs some of this gas to maintain the right 
acid-alkaline balance of the blood).
Relaxing with a couple of deep breaths
Think about the many times you’ve heard someone say “Now just take a couple 
of deep breaths and relax.” This recommendation is so popular because it really 
works! Pain clinics across the country use breathing exercises for pain control. 
Childbirth preparation courses teach Yoga-related breathing techniques to both 
parents to aid the birthing process. Moreover, since the 1970s, stress gurus have 
taught yogic breathing to corporate America with great success.
Yogic breathing is like texting your nervous system with the message to 
relax. One easy way to experience the effect of simple breathing is to try the 
following exercise:
 
1. Sit comfortably in your chair.
 
2. Close your eyes and visualize a swan gliding peacefully across a crystal-
clear lake.
 
3. Now, like the swan, let your breath flow along in a long, smooth, and 
peaceful movement, ideally through your nose.
 
 If your nose is plugged up, try to breathe through your nose and mouth, 
or just through your mouth.
 
4. Extend your breath to its comfortable maximum for 20 rounds; then 
gradually let your breath return to normal.
The cosmic side of breathing
The Yoga scriptures state that humans take 
an average of 21,600 breaths per day. This 
number, which falls within the range accepted 
by modern research, is profoundly symbolic. 
Here’s why: 21,600 is one-fifth of 108,000. The 
number 108, or multiples of it, is charged with 
special significance in India. The importance 
relates to the astronomical fact that the dis-
tance between the sun and the earth is 108 
times greater than the sun’s diameter. The 
symbolism is represented in the 108 beads of 
the rosary used by many Yoga practitioners in 
India. A full round on the rosary is a symbolic 
journey from the earth to heaven — that is, from 
ordinary consciousness to higher conscious-
ness. And even the one-fifth is significant; 5 is 
the number associated with the air element. 
This correlation is one of many that Yoga mas-
ters profess between the human body-mind and 
the universe at large.

5. Afterward, take a few moments to sit with your eyes closed and notice 
the difference in how you feel overall.
 
 Can you imagine how relaxed and calm you’d feel after 10 to 15 minutes 
of conscious yogic breathing?
Practicing safe yogic breathing
As you look forward to the calming and restorative power of yogic breathing, 
take time to reflect on a few safety tips that can help you enjoy your experience.
 
✓ If you have problems with your lungs (such as a cold or asthma), or if 
you have a heart disease, consult your physician first before embarking 
on breath control even under the supervision of a Yoga therapist (unless 
he or she happens to be a physician as well).
 
✓ Don’t practice breathing exercises when the air is too cold or too hot.
 
✓ Avoid practicing in polluted air, including the smoke from incense. 
Whenever possible, practice breath control outdoors or with an open 
window, where you maximize exposure to negative ions (atoms with a 
negative electronic charge). Negative ions in moderation are consid-
ered beneficial for health. On the other hand, positive ions, which are 
produced by your TV and computer, have been connected with fatigue, 
headaches, and respiratory problems.
 
✓ Don’t strain your breathing — remain relaxed while doing the breathing 
exercises.
 
✓ Don’t overdo the number of repetitions. Stay within our guidelines for 
each exercise.
 
✓ Don’t wear any constricting pants or belts.
Reaping the benefits of yogic breathing
In addition to relaxing the body and calming the mind, yogic breathing offers 
an entire spectrum of other benefits that work like insurance, protecting your 
investment in a longer and healthier life. Here are six important advantages 
of controlled breathing:
 
✓ It steps up your metabolism (which helps with weight control).
 
✓ It uses muscles that automatically help improve your posture, prevent-
ing the stiff, slumped carriage characteristic of many older people.
 
✓ It keeps the lung tissue elastic, which allows you to take in more oxygen 
to nourish the 50 trillion cells in your body.

 Chapter 5: Breath and Movement Simplified
Real-life stories on the benefits of yogic breathing
The late T. Krishnamacharya of Chennai 
(Madras), India — one of the great Yoga mas-
ters of the 20th century — is a classic illustra-
tion of the benefits of yogic breathing. On his 
100th birthday celebration, he initiated the cer-
emony by chanting a 30-second-long continu-
ous om sound. He also sat up perfectly straight 
on the floor for many hours every day during the 
festivities, which lasted several days. Not bad 
for a centenarian!
To give another example, Chris Briscoe is a 
baby-boomer beauty, the mother of two grown 
boys, and a long-time popular resident and 
community leader in Malibu, California. In 
her 20s, she developed asthma and for 25 years 
was on heavy medication and allergy shots.
If Chris woke up in the morning wheezing, she 
could count on being in the hospital by that 
evening. Aerobic exercise and allergies also 
induced her asthma. In 1990, Chris attended her 
first Yoga class with me (Larry) at the Malibu 
Community Center, where she learned yogic 
breathing and the principles of breath and 
movement. After only three months of attending 
classes twice a week, practicing yogic breath-
ing at home, and taking Chinese herbs, Chris 
was able to stop taking her asthma medication 
and allergy shots. She has remained in class 
and off medication almost entirely for the past 
19 years. Note: We must stress, however, that 
you consult with your physician before discon-
tinuing prescribed medication.
 
✓ It tones your abdominal area, a common site for health problems 
because many illnesses begin in the intestines.
 
✓ It helps strengthen your immune system.
 
✓ It reduces your levels of tension and anxiety.
Breathing through your 
nose (most of the time)
No matter what anybody else tells you, yogic breathing typically occurs 
through the nose, both during inhalation and exhalation. For traditional yogis 
and yoginis, the mouth is meant for eating and the nose for breathing. We 
know at least three good reasons for breathing through the nose:
 
✓ It slows down the breath because you’re breathing through two small 
openings rather than the one big opening in your mouth, and slow is 
good in Yoga.
 
✓ The air is hygienically filtered and warmed by the nasal passages. Even 
the purest air contains, at the least, dust particles and, at the worst, all 
the toxic pollutants of a metropolis.

66
Part I: Off to a Good Start with Yoga 
 
✓ According to traditional Yoga, nasal breathing stimulates the subtle 
energy center — the so-called ajna-cakra (pronounced ah-gyah-chuk-
rah) located near sinuses in the spot between the eyebrows. This very 
important location is the meeting place of the left (cooling) and the right 
(heating) current of vital energy (prana) that act directly on the nervous 
and endocrine systems. (For the two currents, see the “Alternate nostril 
breathing” section later in this chapter.)
 
Folk wisdom teaches that every rule has its exception, which is definitely the 
case with the yogic rule of breathing through the nose. A few classical yogic 
techniques for breath control require you to breathe through the mouth. 
When we present a mouth-breathing technique, we alert you to that fact.
What if I can’t breathe through my nose?
Some folks suffer from various physiological conditions that prevent them 
from breathing through their noses. Of course, Yoga is flexible. If you have 
difficulty breathing when lying down, try sitting up. The time of day can also 
make a difference in your ability to breathe. For example, you may be more 
congested or exposed to more allergens in the morning than in the afternoon. 
You, of course, can detect the differences.
If you’re still not sure how to settle on a comfortable breathing method, first 
try inhaling through your nose and exhaling through your mouth and, fail-
ing this, just breathe through your mouth and don’t worry for now. Worry is 
always counterproductive.
How about breathing through my nose all the time?
Many Americans participate in more than one kind of physical activity or exer-
cise discipline. Each has its own guidelines and rules for breathing, which we 
suggest you follow. For example, the majority of aerobic activities — running, 
walking, weight lifting, and so on — recommend that you inhale through the 
nose and exhale through the mouth. The reason: You need to move a lot of air 
quickly in and out of your lungs. And breathing only through the nose while 
swimming can be very dangerous. In fact, we don’t recommend underwater 
pranayama unless you enjoy a snootful of water making its way to your lungs.
 
In the beginning, save yogic breathing for your Yoga exercises. Later, when 
you become more skillful at it, you may want to adopt nasal breathing during 
all normal activities. You can then benefit from its calming and hygienic effects 
throughout the day.

67
 Chapter 5: Breath and Movement Simplified
The Mechanics of Yogic Breathing
Most people are either shallow chest breathers or shallow belly breathers. 
Yogic breathing incorporates a complete breath that expands both the chest 
and the abdomen on inhalation either from the chest down or the abdomen 
up. Both are valid techniques. (Figures 5-2 and 5-3 later in the chapter show 
you each of these techniques.)
 
Yogic breathing involves breathing much more deeply than usual, which in 
turn brings more oxygen into your system. Don’t be surprised if you feel a 
little lightheaded or even dizzy in the beginning. If this situation happens 
during your Yoga practice, just rest for a few minutes or lie down until you feel 
like proceeding. Remind yourself that you don’t need to rush.
Some Yoga practitioners think that you can breathe into parts of the body other 
than the lungs. Not so. You inhale the breath through either your nose or mouth, 
and it then expands into the lungs. You may perceive that the breath is moving 
up and down throughout the body, but you’re actually feeling muscle contrac-
tion. Any suggestion of an up or down movement of the breath is due entirely to 
the sequence of your muscular control and the flow of your attention.
In both chest and abdominal breathing, the abdomen draws in on exhalation. 
From a mechanical standpoint, Yogic breathing moves the spine and works 
the muscles and organs of respiration, which primarily include the diaphragm, 
intercostal (between the ribs) and abdominal muscles, and the lungs and heart. 
The diaphragm pulls down when it contracts, which creates more space for 
the lungs during inhalation. The chest noticeably widens. When the diaphragm 
relaxes it moves back into its upward curve, forcing the air out of the lungs.
Notice your breath
When you pay close attention to the rhythm of 
your breath, you may be surprised to notice that 
it has several parts. According to Yoga, the four 
aspects of controlled breathing are:
 ✓ Inhalation (puraka, pronounced poo-rah-kah)
 ✓ Retention or holding after inhalation (antar-
kumbhaka, pronounced ahn-tahr-koom-
bhah-kah)
 ✓ Exhalation (recaka, pronounced reh-chah-kah)
 ✓ Retention or holding after exhalation 
(bahya-kumbhaka, pronounced bah-yah-
koom-bhah-kah)
In this book, we emphasize exhalation. Some 
classical Yoga authorities also refer to a type of 
retention that occurs spontaneously and effort-
lessly in some higher states of consciousness. 
This retention is known as kevala-kumbhaka 
(pronounced keh-vah-lah-koom-bhah-kah), or 
absolute retention.

68
Part I: Off to a Good Start with Yoga 
 
The diaphragm is a vaulted muscle sheath that separates the lungs and heart 
from the stomach, liver, kidneys, and other abdominal organs. It’s attached all 
around the lower border of the rib cage and, by a pair of powerful muscles, to 
the first through fourth lumbar vertebrae. The diaphragm and the chest mus-
cles activate the lungs, which don’t have muscles.
Understanding how your emotions 
affect your diaphragm
Psychologically, people tend to use the diaphragm as a lid to bottle up their 
undigested or unwanted emotions of anger and fear. Chronic contraction of 
the diaphragm makes it inflexible and blocks the free flow of energy between 
the abdomen (the nether region of the bowels) and the chest (the feelings 
associated with the heart). Yogic breathing helps restore flexibility and func-
tion to the diaphragm and removes obstructions to the flow of physical and 
emotional energy. You can then experience liberation of your emotions, 
which can lead you to integrate them with the rest of your life.
Deep breathing not only affects the organs in your chest and abdomen but 
also reaches down into your gut emotions. Don’t be surprised if sighs and 
perhaps even a few tears accompany the tension release your breath work 
achieves. These are welcome signs that you’re peeling off the muscular 
armor you have placed around your abdomen and heart. Instead of feeling 
concerned or embarrassed, rejoice in your newly gained inner freedom! Yoga 
practitioners know that real men do cry.
Appreciating the complete yogic breath
If shallow or erratic breathing puts your well-being at risk, the complete yogic 
breath is your ticket to excellent physical and mental health. If you do no 
other Yoga exercise, the complete Yoga breath — integrally combined with 
relaxation — can still be of invaluable benefit to you. It’s your secret weapon, 
except Yoga doesn’t advocate the use of force.
Belly breathing
Before you jump into practicing the complete yogic breath, try out this exercise:
 
1. Lie flat on your back and place one hand on your chest and the other 
on your abdomen as in Figure 5-1.
 
 Place a small pillow or folded blanket under your head if you have ten-
sion in your neck or if your chin tilts upward. Place a large pillow under 
your knees if your back is uncomfortable.

69
 Chapter 5: Breath and Movement Simplified
 
Figure 5-1: 
Your hand 
position 
helps you 
detect 
motion 
during belly 
breathing.
 
 
2. Take 15 to 20 slow, deep breaths.
 
 During inhalation, expand your abdomen; during exhalation, contract 
your abdomen but keep your chest as motionless as possible. Your 
hands act as motion detectors.
 
3. Pause for a couple of seconds between inhalation and exhalation 
keeping the throat soft.
Belly-to-chest breathing
In belly-to-chest breathing, you really exercise your chest and diaphragm 
muscles as well as your lungs and treat your body with oodles of oxygen and 
life force (prana). When you’re done, your cells are humming with energy, 
and your brain is very grateful to you for the extra boost. You can use this 
form of breathing before you begin your relaxation practice, before and 
where indicated during your practice of the Yoga postures, and in fact when-
ever you feel so inclined throughout the day. You don’t necessarily have 
to lie down as we describe in the following exercise. You can be seated or 
even walking. After practicing this technique for a while, you may find that it 
becomes second nature to you.
 
1. Lie flat on your back, with your knees bent and your feet on the floor 
at hip width, and relax.
 
 Place a small pillow or folded blanket under your head if you have ten-
sion in your neck or if your chin tilts upward. Place a large pillow under 
your knees if your back is uncomfortable.
 
2. Inhale while expanding your abdomen, your ribs and then your chest.
 
 Pause for a couple of seconds.

 Pause again for a couple of seconds.
 
4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 six to twelve times.
 
You can greatly enhance the value of this and other exercises by fully partici-
pating with your mind. Feel the air fill your lungs. Feel your muscles work. Feel 
your body as a whole. Visualize precious life energy entering your lungs and 
every cell of your body, rejuvenating and energizing you. To help you experi-
ence this exercise more profoundly, keep your eyes closed. Place your hands 
on your abdomen and feel it expand upon inhalation.
Chest-to-belly breathing
Classically, yoga teachers taught yogic breathing from the abdomen up on 
inhalation (see the preceding section), which you can see in numerous pub-
lications on Yoga. This method works very well for many people. However, 
in the 1960s, Yoga master T.K.V. Desikachar, with the guidance of his father, 
the late T. Krishnamacharya, began to adapt the traditional yogic breathing 
to the needs of their Western students. Think about it! Folks in the West sit 
in chairs and bend forward too much. The daily sitting routine begins in the 
early morning when they go to the bathroom and then lean over the sink 
to brush their teeth and do whatever else they do to their faces. They sit at 
the breakfast table and then again while they commute to their workplaces, 
where they clock a lot more time sitting and slouching in front of a computer 
or typewriter or bending over a machine. Finally, in the evening, they go 
come home and sit down for dinner and afterward, perhaps, sit in front of the 
television or their computer until their eyes get blurry.
The chest-to-belly breathing emphasizes arching the spine and the upper 
back to compensate for all this bending forward throughout the day, and it 
also works very well for moving in and out of Yoga postures. Chest-to-belly 
breathing is also an excellent energizer in the morning; you can even do it 
before you hop out of bed. We don’t recommend this exercise late at night, 
though, because it’s likely to keep you awake.

 Chapter 5: Breath and Movement Simplified
The following exercise complements the belly-to-chest breathing we cover in 
the preceding section. As with that technique, you can practice the following 
exercise lying down, seated, or even while walking.
 
1. Lie flat on your back, with your knees bent and the feet on the floor at 
hip width, and relax.
 
 Place a small pillow or folded blanket under your head if you have ten-
sion in your neck or if your chin tilts upward. Place a large pillow under 
your knees if your back is uncomfortable.
 
2. Inhale while expanding the chest from the top down and continuing 
this movement downward into the belly as shown in Figure 5-3a.
 
 Pause for a couple of seconds.

Starting out with focus breathing
If you have a little difficulty synchronizing yourself with the rhythm of the com-
plete Yoga breathing techniques, you may want to try a simpler method we call 
focus breathing first. Focus breathing is a great stepping stone to all the other 
techniques. The following list walks you through the phases of focus breathing:
 
✓ Phase one: During your Yoga practice, simply follow the directions we 
give you about when to inhale and exhale for each posture, breathe only 
through the nose, and make the breath a little longer than normal. That’s all 
you have to do! Don’t worry about where the breath is starting or ending, 
just breathe slowly and evenly. (We present the postures in Part II.)
 
✓ Phase two: After you’re used to the phase-one practice, just add a short 
pause of one or two seconds after inhalation and another one after 
exhalation.

72
Part I: Off to a Good Start with Yoga 
 
✓ Phase three: When you’re comfortable with the practices of phases one 
and two, add drawing the belly in during exhalation without force or 
exaggeration.
Realizing the power of a pause
During your normal shallow breathing, you notice a slight natural pause 
between inhalation and exhalation. This pause becomes very important in 
yogic breathing; even though it only lasts one or two seconds, the pause is a 
natural moment of stillness and meditation. If you pay attention to this pause, 
it can help you become more aware of the unity between body, breath, and 
mind — all of which are key elements in your Yoga practice. With the help of 
a teacher, you also can discover how to lengthen the pause during various 
Yoga postures to heighten its positive effects.
Partners in Yoga: Breath 
and Postural Movement
In Hatha Yoga, breathing is just as important as the postures, which we 
describe in Part II. How you breathe when you’re moving into, holding, or 
moving out of any given posture can greatly increase the efficiency and the 
benefits of your practice. Think of the breath as mileage plus. The more you 
use breathing consciously, the more mileage you gain for your health and 
longevity. Here are some basic guidelines:
 
✓ Let the breath surround the movement. The breath leads the movement 
by a couple of moments; that is, you initiate breathing (both inhalation and 
exhalation), and then you make the movement. When you inhale, the body 
opens or expands, and when you exhale, the body folds or contracts.
 
✓ Both the inhalation and the exhalation end with a natural pause.
 
✓ In the beginning, let the breath dictate the length of the postural 
movement. For example, if you’re raising your arms as you inhale 
and you run out of breath before you reach your goal, just pause your 
breathing for a moment and then bring your arms back down as you 
exhale. With practice, your breath gradually gets longer.
 
✓ Let the breath itself be your teacher. When your breath sounds 
labored, you need to back off or come out of a posture.
 
✓ Try to visualize the breath flowing into the area you’re working with 
any given posture.

73
 Chapter 5: Breath and Movement Simplified
Breathing in four directions
You can move your body in four natural directions:
 
✓ Flexion: Bending forward
 
✓ Extension: Bending backward
 
✓ Lateral flexion: Bending sideways
 
✓ Rotation: Twisting your body
Normally, when people move they tend to hold or strain their breath. In Yoga, 
you simply follow the natural flow of the breath. As a rule, adopt this pattern:
 
✓ Inhale when moving into back bends (as shown in Figure 5-4a).
 
✓ Exhale when moving into forward bends (see Figure 5-4b).
 
✓ Exhale when moving into side bends (see Figure 5-4c).
 
✓ Exhale when moving into twists (as shown in Figure 5-4d).

Recognizing the distinct roles of movement 
and holding in Yoga postures
Most Yoga books talk about stationary or held Yoga postures (asanas). We 
suggest that before trying to hold a posture, you first become acquainted 
with moving in and out of most of the postures we recommend in this book, 
following the rules of breath and movement in the preceding section. When 

74
Part I: Off to a Good Start with Yoga 
you can move in and out of a given posture easily and confidently, try hold-
ing the posture for a short period without holding or straining your breath. 
You know you’re straining when your face turns into a grimace or you feel it 
going red like a tomato. Getting a handle on moving into and out of the pos-
tures before adding the element of holding is important for three reasons:
 
✓ It helps prepare your muscles and joints by bringing circulation to the 
area. It’s like juicing up your joints, which adds a safety factor.
 
✓ It helps you experience the intimate connection between body, breath, 
and mind.
 
✓ In the case of stretching postures, moving in and out of a given pos-
ture before holding the posture supports the concept of Proprioceptive 
Neuromuscular Facilitation (PNF). If you tighten a muscle before stretch-
ing it either by gentle resistance (isotonic) or by pushing against a fixed 
force (isometric), the subsequent stretch is deeper than just using a 
static pose. Scientific research supports this phenomenon; numerous 
physical therapy texts refer to it as PNF.
The Yoga Miracle
To see and experience firsthand the power of PNF (introduced in the preced-
ing section) in the context of Yoga, grab yourself a partner and follow these 
instructions for what we call The Yoga Miracle. You find that you can achieve 
a deeper stretch than you normally would.
 
1. Lie on your back, with your left leg bent and your left foot on the 
floor; your right leg is up in the air and slightly bent.
 
 Ask your partner to kneel in the lunge position near your feet.
 
2. Have your partner test the flexibility of your hamstrings by holding 
the back of your right heel and pushing it gently towards you until 
you reach the first resistance point.
 
 The partner on the floor is relaxed and doesn’t resist. (See Figure 5-5a.) 
Be sure not to force anything.
 
3. Bring your right leg back to the starting point and then begin to push 
against the kneeling partner’s hand as shown in Figure 5-5b.
 
 The kneeling partner now either gently resists your right foot completely 
(isometrically) or allows your foot to move a little with resistance (isotonically).
 
 Both tests produce the same effect. As you push against your partner’s 
hand, your right hamstring muscles tighten. You want these muscles to 
tighten for about ten seconds.

ibility and

4. After approximately ten seconds, the partner on the ground relaxes 
the right leg and then allows the standing partner to repeat Step 2 (see 
Figure 5-5c).
 
 Compare the results to those from the original Step 2 stretch and behold 
the Yoga Miracle!
 
Don’t try to push your partner over, just push until you feel your leg muscles 
tighten. Next, after about ten seconds, release your leg and allow your partner 
to stretch you again by gently pushing against your heel, causing your leg to 
move toward you in a stretch that’s not forced, as shown in Figure 5-5c. See 
how far you can extend this time. You may be pleasantly surprised!
Answering common breath 
and movement questions
Getting the hang of breath and movement takes a bit of work when you tackle 
them separately, and combining them successfully can be even trickier. The 
following sections give you some tips on handling both.

76
Part I: Off to a Good Start with Yoga 
How much should I move and how long should I hold?
We note the number of repetitions and how long to hold them in all our recom-
mended programs. With practice, you develop an idea of what’s right for you; a 
lot depends on how you feel at any given moment. In general, we suggest at least 
three but no more than eight repetitions for a dynamic, or moving, posture. You 
can put together a program that has only moving postures, but normally we 
recommend a combination of both static (still) and dynamic postures.
 
We often ask you to hold a posture for six to eight breaths, which translates 
to roughly 30 seconds. Keep breathing when you hold a posture — don’t hold 
your breath.
What about bouncing when I hold a stretching posture?
 
Now and then, we still see eager Yoga practitioners seeking to achieve better 
flexibility by bouncing during the holding phase of a stretching posture. This 
practice is part of old-school training, which really isn’t such a good habit 
after all. Bouncing not only tends to disconnect you from the breath but also 
can be risky, especially if your muscles are stiff or not adequately warmed 
up. Be kind to yourself!
How do I start combining breath with movement?
The arrows in the following exercise and wherever they appear in this book tell 
you the direction of postural movement and the part of the breath that goes 
with the movement. Inhale means inhalation, exhale means exhalation, and 
breaths means the number of breaths defining the length of a postural hold.
 
1. Lie on your back comfortably with your legs straight or bent.
 
 Place your arms at your sides near your hips with your palms turned 
down (see Figure 5-6a).
 
2. Inhale through your nose and, after one or two seconds, begin to slowly 
raise your arms up over your head — in sync with inhalation — until 
they touch the ground behind you (see Figure 5-6b).
 
 Leave your arms slightly bent.
 
3. When you reach the end of inhalation, pause for one or two seconds 
even if your arms don’t make it to the floor and then exhale slowly 
through your nose and bring your arms back to your sides along the 
same path.

4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 with a nice slow rhythm.
 
 Remember, open or expand as you inhale, fold or contract as you exhale.
After you become comfortable with this exercise, combine it with our rec-
ommended breathing techniques from earlier in this chapter: focus breath-
ing (which we cover in “Starting out with Focus Breathing”) or any of the 
techniques in “Appreciating the complete yogic breath” (belly breathing, 
belly-to-chest breathing, or chest-to-belly breathing). You can decide which 
technique you prefer as you begin combining breathing with movement.
Sounding Off: Yogic Breathing
Sound, which is a form of vibration, is one of the means that Yoga employs 
to harmonize the vibration of your body and mind. In fact, the repetition of 
special sounds is one of the older and more potent techniques of Yoga. Here, 
we show you how to try this technique in conjunction with conscious breath-
ing. A good way to start is to use the soft-sounding syllables ah, ma, and sa. 
(We’re not asking you to chant, although chanting can be a great and useful 
experience as well.) Sound makes your exhalation longer and also tightens 
your abdominal muscles.
Try the following exercise while sitting in a chair or on the floor:
 
1. Take a deep breath, and then as you exhale make a long ah sound in 
a way that you find pleasing and comfortable.
 
 Continue the same sound for as long as your exhalation lasts. Then take 
a resting breath in between and repeat the exercise a total of five times.
 
2. Relax for a few moments and next do five repetitions with the sound ma.
Good vibes
Yoga masters have long known that the uni-
verse is an ocean of vibrations. Some have 
maintained that even the ultimate reality is a 
state of continuous vibration — but a vibration 
that exceeds the three dimensions of space. 
Some quantum physicists call this entity a 
holomovement. The Sanskrit word for vibration 
is spanda (pronounced spun-dah). According to 
Yoga, the human body and mind are constantly 
vibrating. However, this vibration is more or less 
disharmonious and out of sync with the super-
vibration of the ultimate reality (which we cover 
in Chapters 1 and 21). This disharmony creates 
unhappiness, alienation, and a sense of being 
separate from the physical world. The purpose 
of Yoga is to remove this disharmony and syn-
chronize the body and mind with the ultimate 
reality, restoring joy and the sense of being 
connected with everyone and everything.

78
Part I: Off to a Good Start with Yoga 
 
3. Relax again and conclude by using the sound sa five times.
 
 After you complete the full cycle, just sit quietly for a few minutes and 
notice how relaxed you feel.
True yogic breathing also includes the throat sound, which forms part of the 
traditional practice of ujjayi (pronounced ooh-jah-yee), or “victorious” breath 
control. This more advanced technique is often mistakenly identified as sound 
breathing. The ujjayi sound is produced with the mouth closed and by breathing 
through the nose. By slightly constricting the throat during inhalation and exha-
lation, you produce a soft hissing sound similar to a baby’s breathing or a very 
gentle snore. This technique is easiest to pick up during exhalation; you can then 
gradually apply it to the inhalation phase. If you’re making the sound properly, 
you notice a slight contraction of your abdomen. You want your exhale to be 
audible to you but not to someone standing four feet away from you. Certainly 
don’t strain to the point where you make a grimace! If the throat sound doesn’t 
happen for you right away, just leave it until later — no need to rush.
 
This kind of breathing stimulates the energetic center at the throat and is 
quite relaxing. Some evidence states that it slows down the heart rate, lowers 
blood pressure, and induces a deeper and more restful sleep.
Practicing Breath Control 
the Traditional Way
Hatha Yoga includes various methods of breath control, all of which belong 
to the more advanced practices and traditionally follow extensive purifica-
tion of body and mind. Some Western teachers have incorporated these 
methods into their beginner’s classes, but our experience shows us that 
they’re best at the intermediary to advanced levels. There are, however, 
three methods that we believe are suitable for beginners if you practice them 
with the necessary modifications and precautions.
Traditional Hatha Yoga emphasizes holding the breath — not a good idea 
for beginners. In this section, we focus on techniques that are safe for any 
healthy person to practice.
 
The cooling methods discussed in this section are best done in warm weather 
to avoid overcooling.

79
 Chapter 5: Breath and Movement Simplified
Alternate nostril breathing
Lab researchers have demonstrated what Yoga masters have known for hun-
dreds, if not thousands, of years: Humans don’t breathe evenly through both 
nostrils. In a two-to-three-hour cycle, the nostrils become alternately dominant. 
It appears that left-nostril breathing is particularly connected with functions of 
the left cerebral hemisphere (notably verbal skills), and right-nostril breathing 
seems to connect more with the right hemisphere (notably spatial performance).
The technique called alternate nostril breathing goes by various others names, 
including nadi-shodhana (“channel cleansing,” pronounced nah-dee-shod-hah-
nah). The following steps help you tackle it at the beginning level:
 
1. Sit comfortably on a chair or in one of the yogic sitting postures with 
your back straight (see Chapter 7).
 
2. Check which nostril has the most air flowing through it and begin 
alternative breathing with the open nostril.
 
 If both are equally open, all the better. In that case, begin with the left 
nostril.
 
 You can check which nostril is dominant simply by breathing through 
one nostril and then the other and comparing the two flows.
Expanding the life force through Yoga
According to Yoga, the breath is just the mate-
rial aspect of an energy that is far more subtle 
and universal. Called prana (pronounced prah-
nah), which means both “breath” and “life,” 
this energy corresponds to the Chinese concept 
chi, known to a growing number of Westerners 
from acupuncture and Far Eastern martial arts.
This life force underlies everything that exists 
and, ultimately, is the power (shakti, pro-
nounced shuk-tee) aspect of the spirit itself. 
When prana leaves the body, a person dies. 
Thus, the practitioners of Hatha Yoga seek to 
carefully preserve the life force and enhance 
or expand it as much as possible. The most 
significant practice for doing so is pranayama 
(pronounced prah-nah-yah-mah), a Sanskrit 
term that is often incorrectly explained as 
being composed of prana and yama (“con-
trol”). In fact, it drives from prana and ayama 
(pronounced ah-yah-mah) — the expansion or 
extension of the life force. So, although the term 
is conveniently translated as “breath control,” 
it’s actually much more.
Science has solved many mysteries but is still 
puzzled about life itself. Some scientists now 
believe that a subtle, vital energy that can’t be 
reduced to biochemistry does indeed operate 
in the body. They have named it bioenergy or 
bioplasma. Through Yoga, especially yogic 
breathing, you can come to control that energy, 
whatever you want to call it, in your own body. 
Some Yoga masters can even influence the life 
force in someone else’s body, helping them to 
heal or speeding up their spiritual awakening.

3. Place your right hand so that your thumb is on the right nostril and 
the little and ring fingers are on the left nostril, with the index and 
middle fingers tucked against the ball of the thumb.
 
 Note: According to some authorities, you should place the index and 
middle fingers on the spot between the eyebrows (known as the third 
eye). We recommend the other method if it feels comfortable to you.
 
4. Close the blocked nostril and, mentally counting to five, inhale gently 
but fully through the open nostril — don’t strain (see Figure 5-7).
 
5. Open the blocked nostril and close the other nostril and exhale, again 
mentally counting to five.
 
6. Inhale through the same nostril to the count of five, and exhale 
through the opposite nostril, repeating 10 to 15 times.
As your lung capacity improves, you can make your inhalations and exhala-
tions longer, but never force the breath. Gradually increase the overall dura-
tion of the exercise from, say, 3 minutes to 15 minutes.
 
Figure 5-7: 
Alternate 
nostril 
breathing.
 
The cooling breath
This technique, which in Sanskrit is called shitali (pronounced sheet-ah-lee), 
gets its name from the cooling effect that it has on the body and the mind. 
Traditionally, the cooling breath is believed to remove fever, still hunger, 
quench thirst, and alleviate diseases of the spleen. Here’s how you practice it:
 
1. Sit in a comfortable Yoga posture or on a chair and relax your body.
 
2. Curl your tongue lengthwise and let its tip protrude from your mouth 
as shown in Figure 5-8.

81
 Chapter 5: Breath and Movement Simplified
 
Figure 5-8: 
Curled 
tongue for 
cooling 
breath.
 
 
3. Slowly suck in air through the tube formed by your tongue and exhale 
gently through the nose
 
 Repeat this breath 10 to 15 times.
 
If you can’t curl your tongue — which is a genetic ability — you can practice 
the Crow’s Beak instead. This technique is technically known as kaki-mudra 
(“crow’s gesture,” pronounced kah-kee-moo-drah). Here you pucker your 
mouth, leaving just a small space for the air to pass through. Inhale through 
the mouth and exhale through the nose as with shitali.
Shitkari: Inhaling through the mouth
Shitkari (pronounced sheet-kah-ree) is another technique that calls for inhala-
tion through the mouth, and its effects are similar to the cooling breath we 
discuss in the preceding section. The term means “that which makes a suck-
ing sound.” Sitting upright and relaxed, move through the following routine:
 
1. Open your mouth but keep your teeth closed, as if you were going to 
brush your front teeth.
 
2. Place the tip of the tongue against the palate behind the upper teeth.
 
 Keep your eyes closed and make sure that you don’t squint your face.
 
3. Inhale through your teeth and breathe out through your nose.
 
 Repeat the inhalation and exhalation 10 to 15 times.
 
If your gums are sensitive or a visit to the dentist is long overdue, avoid doing 
this practice when the air is cool.

82
Part I: Off to a Good Start with Yoga 
Kapala-bhati: Frontal sinus cleansing
Kapala-bhati (pronounced kah-pah-la-bhah-tee) literally means “skull luster” 
and is also known as frontal sinus (or brain) cleansing. The curious Sanskrit 
name is explained by the fact that the technique causes a sense of luminosity 
in the head, as well as lightheadedness, especially when you’re overdoing it. 
Sometimes this breathing method is wrongly equated with bhastrika (“bel-
lows”), which is a more advanced technique of rapid breathing, but kapala-
bhati belongs to the preparatory practices of traditional Hatha Yoga. The 
technique requires rapid inhalation and exhalation through the nose with 
short staccato breaths, with emphasis on exhalation.
Kapala-bhati is a very energizing technique that you can use to combat physi-
cal or mental fatigue, so if you value your sleep, don’t practice it at night. It 
can also warm your body (but be careful to avoid practicing this technique in 
cold air!). Before attempting the following exercise, get the hang of relaxing 
your abdomen during inhalation and pulling it in during exhalation. Gradually 
shorten the exhalations.
 
1. Sit, if you can, in a comfortable cross-legged posture, holding your 
spine straight and resting your hands in your lap.
 
2. Take a few deep breaths and, after your last inhalation, do 15 to 20 
fast exhalations each followed by a short inhalation, using the nose to 
inhale and exhale.
 
 Repeat this step twice. With each exhalation, which lasts only for half a 
second, pull in your abdomen.
 
If you’re contracting your facial or shoulder muscles during kapala-bhati, 
you’re not practicing correctly. Remember to stay relaxed and let the abdomi-
nal muscles do most of the work.
I’ve got the whole world in my breath
According to Yoga, everyone is interconnected 
and part of the same single reality. You can 
make this abstract fact more concrete and 
personal when you consider the breath. Each 
breath you take contains about ten sextillion 
atoms, which is the number 1 followed by 22 
zeros. Multiply this by 6 billion people and by 
roughly 21,000 exhalations per day. Every time 
you take a breath, you inhale an average of 
one atom from the exhaled atoms in the atmo-
sphere. Upon exhalation, you contribute to the 
collective store of exhaled breaths. Therefore, 
you’re literally sharing other people’s breaths 
and life energies, and they are sharing yours.

Here we introduce dozens of Hatha Yoga postures for a 
balanced and varied exercise program. For your conve-
nience, we organize the Yoga postures into basic catego-

▶ Discovering the traditional purpose and benefits of postures
▶ Starting out slow and safe with easier postures
C
ulture greatly influences the way humans sit. People in the Eastern 
hemisphere favor squatting on their haunches or sitting cross-legged on 
the floor, but most Westerners are only comfortable sitting on chairs — as 
you’re probably doing right now as you read this book. Actually, your every-
day sitting preferences have a decided effect on your capacity to feel steady 
and comfortable in the Yoga postures, whether standing or sitting.
If you’re new to Yoga and its sitting postures, you’ll soon discover that a life-
time of chair-sitting exacts a stiff price. Your work with the postures in this 
book can help you gradually improve your floor sitting, but until you’re ready 
to make the transition to the floor, use a chair when you sit for formal practice. 
After all, two of the larger Yoga organizations in the world, The Self-Realization 
Fellowship (SRF) and Transcendental Meditation (TM), encourage their 
Western practitioners to use a chair for meditation and breathing exercises.
In this chapter, we describe the following sitting postures that you can use 
for relaxation, meditation, breath control, various cleansing practices, or as a 
starting point for other postures:
 
✓ Chair-sitting posture
 
✓ Easy posture
 
✓ Thunderbolt posture
 
✓ Auspicious posture
 
✓ Perfect posture
 
Many other sitting postures exist in Yoga; you can gradually add to your basic 
repertoire as your joints become more flexible and your back muscles gain 
strength.

Part II: Postures for Health Maintenance and Restoration 
Understanding the Philosophy 
of Yoga Postures
Postures, or asanas (pronounced ah-sah-nahs) in Sanskrit, are probably the 
part of Yoga that you’re most familiar with. They’re those poses that look 
impossible but that are done with ease by many Yoga students. Beyond 
stretching and increasing strength and flexibility, Yoga postures help you get 
in tune with yourself, your body, and your environment. Through asanas, you 
can begin to see yourself as one with your environment.
 
For traditional Yoga masters, asanas are just one part of the yogic system. 
Postures are the basis of the third limb of the classical eightfold path of Yoga 
formulated by Yoga master Patanjali. (Flip to Chapter 20 for more on the 
eightfold path.)
Yogic postures are more than mere bodily poses — they’re also expressions 
of your state of mind. An asana is poise, composure, carriage — all words 
suggesting an element of balance and refinement. The postures demonstrate 
the profound connection between body and mind.
Traditional Yoga experts view the body as a temple dedicated to the spirit. 
They believe that you must keep the body pure and beautiful to honor the 
spiritual reality it houses. Each posture is another way of remembering that 
higher principle — commonly called the spirit, divine, or transcendental 
Self — that the body enshrines. If you prefer to practice Yoga without such 
ideas, you can still use posture as a way of connecting with nature at large 
because your body isn’t totally isolated from its environment. Where exactly 
does your body end, and where exactly does the surrounding space begin? 
How much does your body’s electromagnetic field extend beyond your 
skin? How far away did the oxygen particles that are now part of your body 
originate?
Asana by any other name
The term asana simply means “sitting.” It can 
denote both the surface you sit on and the bodily 
posture. An alternative term is tirtha, or “pilgrim-
age center,” which suggests that practitioners 
shouldn’t approach Yoga postures casually but 
respectfully, with great mental focus.
Some postures are called mudras (pronounced 
moo-drahs) or “seals,” because they’re especially 
effective in keeping the life energy (prana) 
sealed within the body. This leads to greater 
vitality and better mental focusing. Life energy 
is everywhere, both inside and outside the body, 
but you must properly harness it within the body 
in order to promote health and happiness.

87
 Chapter 6: Please Be Seated
 
According to traditional Yoga manuals, the main purpose of asana is to prepare 
the body to sit quietly, easily, and steadily for breathing exercises and medita-
tion. The way you sit is an important foundation technique for these practices; 
when you perform them properly, the sitting postures act as natural “tranquil-
izers” for the body, and when the physical vehicle is still, the mind soon follows.
If your knees are more than a few inches higher than your hips when you 
sit cross-legged on the floor, it’s an indication that your hip joints are tight. 
If you try to sit for a long while in this position for meditation or breathing 
exercises, you may very well end up with an aching back. Don’t feel bad — 
you’re not alone. Accept your current limitations in this area and use a prop, 
like a firm cushion or thickly folded blanket, to raise your buttocks off the 
floor high enough to drop your knees at least level with your hips.
 
If you attend a lecture or other special gathering at a Hatha Yoga center, remem-
ber that few, if any, chairs are usually available, so be prepared to sit on the floor. 
If you aren’t accustomed to sitting cross-legged on the floor with an unsupported 
back, bring along a prop, such as a firm cushion or a blanket, to raise your but-
tocks (see Chapter 19). Arrive early so that you can find a wall or post to sit 
against to support your back. If none of these ideas sits well with you (no pun 
intended), just bring your own folding chair and sit near the rear of the room.
Looking at the Many 
Variations of Sitting
Some contemporary Hatha Yoga manuals feature more than 50 sitting pos-
tures, which demonstrate not only the inventiveness of Yoga practitioners 
but also the body’s amazing versatility. Yet, all you may ever need or want 
are perhaps half a dozen yogic sitting postures. The following sections 
describe some good sitting postures and show you how to execute them.
 
For postures that involve sitting on the floor, raising your buttocks off the 
floor on a firm cushion or thickly folded blanket is helpful because it allows 
you to sit comfortably and stably without slumping.
 
Be sure to alternate the cross of the legs from day to day when practicing any 
of the sitting postures because you don’t want to become lopsided.
Chair-sitting posture
Because cultural habits inspire most Westerners to sit in a chair when they 
meditate, floor sitting is usually something folks have to work up to with 
practice. Over time, your asana practice can help you build comfort with 

88
Part II: Postures for Health Maintenance and Restoration 
sitting on the floor for exercises. As Figure 6-1 shows, your ear, shoulder, and 
hip are in alignment, as viewed from the side. The following steps walk you 
through the chair-sitting posture:
 
1. Use a sturdy armless chair and sit near the front edge of the seat with-
out leaning against the chair back.
 
 Make sure that your feet are flat on the floor. If they don’t quite reach, 
support them with a block, folded blanket, or phone book.
 
2. Rest your hands on your knees with your palms down and then close 
your eyes.
 
3. Rock your spine a few times, alternately slumping forward and arch-
ing back to explore its full range of motion.
 
 Settle into a comfortable upright position midway between the two extremes.
 
4. Lift your chest, without exaggerating the gentle inward curve in your 
lower back, and balance your head over your torso.

The easy posture: Sukhasana
According to Yoga master Patanjali, posture should be “steady” (sthira) and 
“easeful” (sukha). The basic Yoga sitting position is called, appropriately, 

89
 Chapter 6: Please Be Seated
the easy/easeful posture (sukhasana), which Westerners sometimes call the 
tailor’s seat. We strongly recommend that beginners start their floor sitting 
practice with the easy posture, which we illustrate in Figure 6-2.
 
The easy posture is a steady and comfortable sitting position for meditation 
and breathing exercises. The posture also helps you become more aware of 
and actually increase the flexibility in your hips and spine and is therefore a 
good preparation for more advanced postures.
Here’s how it works:
 
1. Sit on the floor with your legs straight out in front of you.
 
 Place your hands on the floor beside your hips with your palms down 
and fingers pointing forward; shake your legs up and down a few times 
to get the kinks out.
 
2. Cross your legs at the ankles with the left leg on top, the right leg below.
 
Figure 6-2: 
Be sure 
that you’re 
steady and 
comfortable 
in the easy 
posture.
 
 
3. Press your palms on the floor and slide each foot toward the opposite 
knee, until your right foot is underneath your left knee and your left 
foot is underneath your right knee.
 
4. Lengthen the spine by stretching your back in an upward motion and 
balance your head over your torso.

Part II: Postures for Health Maintenance and Restoration 
Note: In the classic (traditionally taught) posture, you drop your chin to your 
chest and extend your arms and lock your elbows; we suggest, however, that 
you rest your hands on your knees with your palms down and elbows bent, 
and keep your head upright, which is more relaxing for beginners.
The thunderbolt posture: Vajrasana
 
The thunderbolt posture is one of the safer sitting postures for students with 
back problems. Vajrasana increases the flexibility of your ankles, knees, and 
thighs, improves circulation to the abdomen, and is good for digestion.
Use the following steps to practice this posture:
 
1. Kneel on the floor and sit back on your heels.
 
 Position each heel under the buttock on the same side and rest your 
hands on the tops of your knees with your elbows bent and palms down.
 
2. Lengthen your spine by stretching your back in an upward motion, 
balance your head over your torso, and look straight ahead as shown 
in Figure 6-3.

 Chapter 6: Please Be Seated
Note: In the classic posture, which we don’t recommend for beginners, you 
rest your chin on your upper chest and extend your arms until your elbows 
are locked and your hands are on your knees.
 
If you have trouble sitting back on your heels because of tightness in your 
thigh muscles or pain in your knees, put a cushion or folded blanket between 
your thighs and calves. Increase the thickness of your lift until you can sit 
down comfortably. If you feel discomfort in the fronts of your ankles, put a 
rolled-up towel or blanket underneath them.
 
The Sanskrit word vajra (pronounced vahj-rah) means “thunderbolt” or “ada-
mantine.” So, this posture is also known as the adamantine posture.
The auspicious posture: Svastikasana
Before its perversion in Nazi Germany, the svastika served as a solar symbol 
for good fortune. This is also its meaning in Yoga. The term is made up of the 
prefix su (“good”) and asti (“is”): “It’s good.”
The svastikasana improves the flexibility of the hips, knees, and ankles and 
strengthens the back. The following instructions help you get the hang of this 
posture.
 
Use the preparation series for advanced sitting postures in Chapter 6 to 
improve your performance for this posture.
 
1. Sit on the floor with your legs straight out in front of you; place your 
hands on the floor beside your hips with your palms down and fingers 
pointing forward.
 
 Shake your legs up and down a few times to get the kinks out.
 
2. Bend your left knee and place the left foot sole against the inside of 
your right thigh with your left heel close to your groin.
 
 If this step is difficult, don’t use this pose.
 
3. Bend your right knee toward you and take hold of your right foot with 
both hands.
 
4. Grip the front of your ankle with your right hand and the ball of your 
big toe with your left; slide the little-toe side of your foot between your 
left thigh and calf until only your big toe is visible, wiggling the big-toe 
side of your left foot up between the right thigh and calf if you can.
 
5. Rest your hands on your knees with your arms relaxed and palms down.
 
6. Lengthen your spine by stretching your back in an upward motion, 
balance your head over your torso, and look straight ahead as illus-
trated in Figure 6-4.

Figure 6-4: 
The aus-
picious 
posture.
 
Note: In the classic posture, the chin rests on the chest with the arms 
straight down and palms open in jnana mudra at the knees. The bottom or 
left foot is pulled up and wedged between the right calf and thigh.
Jnana mudra (pronounced gyah-nah moo-drah) or “wisdom seal” is one of a 
number of hand positions used in Yoga. To do this mudra, bring the tip of 
your index finger to the tip of your thumb to form a circle; extend the three 
remaining fingers, keeping them close together (as shown in Figure 6-5). This 
hand gesture makes a good circuit, sealing off the life energy (prana) in your 
body. (Check out Chapter 5 for more on prana.)
The perfect posture: Siddhasana
The Sanskrit word siddha (pronounced sidd-hah) means both “perfect” and 
“adept.” In Yoga, an adept isn’t just a skillful practitioner but an accomplished 
master who has attained inner freedom.
 
Many Yoga masters in bygone eras preferred this posture and used it often 
in place of the lotus posture. We don’t cover either the half lotus or the full 
lotus position in this book because they’re suitable only for more experienced 
students.

The siddhasana improves the flexibility of your hips, knees, and ankles, and 
strengthens the back. The posture is considered the perfect meditation posture 
for those practicing celibacy. Siddhasana is also beneficial for men with vari-
ous prostate problems.
 
The preparation series for advanced sitting postures in Chapter 6 can help 
you with this posture.
Here’s how you do it:
 
1. Sitting on the floor with your legs straight out in front of you, place 
your hands at your sides (close to your hips) with your palms down 
and fingers forward.
 
 Shake your legs out in front of you a few times.
 
2. Bend your left knee and bring your left heel into your groin near the 
perineum (the area between the anus and the genitals).
 
 Stabilize your left ankle with your left hand.
 
3. Bend your right knee and slide your right heel towards the front of 
your left ankle.
 
4. Lift your right foot, position your right ankle just above your left 
ankle, and bring your right heel into the genital area.

94

5. Tuck the little-toe side of your right foot between your left thigh 
and calf.
 
6. Place your hands palms down on the same-side knee with arms 
relaxed.
 
7. Straighten and extend your back and neck, bringing your head up 
nice and tall; look straight ahead as shown in Figure 6-6.
 
 You can use a cushion to raise your hips so that they’re level with your 
knees.
Note: In the classic posture, which we don’t recommend for beginners, your 
chin rests on your chest, your arms are straight down, elbows locked, with 
your palms open in jnana mudra (discussed in the preceding section) at your 
knees. The big-toe side of your left foot is pulled up and wedged between 
your right calf and thigh.

Chapter 7
Standing Tall
In This Chapter
▶ Standing as an art
▶ Singing praises of standing postures
▶ Practicing standing postures
S
tanding upright is a uniquely human trait, and Yoga is a uniquely human 
practice. In this chapter, we discuss standing from the Yoga perspective, with 
an emphasis on the difference between just standing and the more quintessential 
version of standing. The simple act of standing upright brings your spine, muscles, 
tendons, and ligaments into play. Ordinarily, these parts do their assigned tasks 
quite automatically. But in order to stand efficiently and elegantly, you also need 
to bring awareness to the act, and that’s where Yoga enters the picture.
In this chapter, we give you ten of the more common and favored Yoga stand-
ing postures to practice. They can help you discover the art of standing con-
sciously, efficiently, and beautifully.
Identifying That Two-Legged Creature
We are human in large part because hundreds of thousands of years ago our 
ancestors figured out how to literally stand on their own two feet. Appropriately, 
the yogic standing postures make up the foundation of asana practice.
The way that you stand tells a lot about you. These days, a person who stands 
tall usually sucks in the belly and sticks out the chest and chin in military fash-
ion. But you can stand tall and straight and be relaxed at the same time.
 
Body and mind form a unit; they’re the outside and the inside of the same 
person: you. In a way, your body is a map of your mind.
Through regular Yoga practice, you can use the feedback from your body to 
discipline your mind, and the feedback from your mind (particularly your 
emotions) to train your body.

96
Part II: Postures for Health Maintenance and Restoration 
Standing Strong
The standing postures are a kind of microcosm of the practice of asana as a 
whole (except for inversions, or upside-down postures, described in Chapter 10); 
you may hear that you can derive everything you need to know to master your 
physical practice from the standing postures. The standing postures help you 
strengthen your legs and ankles, open your hips and groin, and improve your 
sense of balance. In turn, you develop the ability to “stand your ground” and to 
“stand at ease,” which is an important aspect of the yogic lifestyle.
 
The standing postures are very versatile. You can use them in the following ways:
 
✓ As a general warm-up for your practice.
 
✓ In preparation for a specific group of postures (we like to think of the 
standing forward bends, for example, as a kind of on-ramp to the seated 
forward bends).
 
✓ For compensation (or to counterbalance another posture, such as a 
back bend or side bend). For more information, see Chapter 15.
 
✓ For rest.
 
✓ As the main body of your practice.
 
You can creatively adapt many postures from other groups to a standing posi-
tion, which you can then use as a learning (or teaching) tool, or for therapeu-
tic purposes. Take, for example, the well-known cobra posture, a back bend 
that many beginning students find hard on the lower back (see Chapter 11). 
By performing this same posture in a standing position near a wall, you can 
use the changed relationship to gravity, the freedom of not having your hips 
blocked by the floor, and the pressure of the hands on the wall to free the 
lower back. Then you can apply this newly won understanding about the back 
in your practice of the more demanding traditional form of the cobra posture 
or any other posture that you choose to modify at the wall.
You’re grounded!
Calling yogic standing posture an asana (“seat”) 
may seem contradictory, but the posture actu-
ally helps you become firmly grounded. In Yoga, 
grounding is as important as reaching up. You 
can reach the heights of Yoga only when you’re 
as sturdy as a mountain or a sequoia.

 Chapter 7: Standing Tall
Exercising Your Options
In this section, we introduce you to ten standing postures and describe the 
step-by-step process for each exercise. We also discuss the benefits and the 
classic (traditionally taught) version of the posture. We don’t recommend the 
classic version for beginners because, in most cases, the postures are more 
difficult and sometimes risky. Here are a few tips before you get started with 
the standing postures:
 
✓ Many of these postures start in the mountain posture, so be sure to 
check out the “Mountain posture: Tadasana” section.
 
✓ When you try the postures on your own, follow the instructions for each 
exercise carefully, including the breathing. Always move into and out of 
the posture slowly and pause after the inhalation and exhalation (flip to 
Chapter 5 for more on breathing). Complete each posture by relaxing 
and returning to the starting place.
 
✓ When you bend forward from all the standing postures, start with your 
legs straight (without locking your knees) and then soften your knees 
when you feel the muscles pulling in the back of your legs.
Now, that’s a stretch!
A beautiful young woman named Heather came 
to one of my (Larry’s) beginners’ Yoga class in 
Brentwood, California, for her “first ever” Yoga 
class. It was clear right away that she wasn’t 
very flexible; in fact, she was perhaps the most 
inflexible young person I’d ever seen. When 
I led the class in seated forward bends, for 
example, she literally couldn’t touch her knees. 
In that moment, when she realized how tight 
she really was, she began to cry. I spoke to 
her after class and learned that she had been 
involved in competitive sports since age 5, and 
that now, at 17, she played on a state champion 
volleyball team. As athletic as she was, she had 
done very little stretching over the years . . . and 
it showed.
I recommended that she lean her buttocks 
against a wall with her feet about 3 feet away 
from the wall and just hang down, keeping her 
knees “soft,” as in Forgiving Limbs (covered in 
Chapter 3). In this modified standing posture, 
she had an easy angle to bend forward and 
release her back and hamstrings. She prac-
ticed this standing posture every day and within 
three weeks, she experienced a dramatic 
change. For the first time, she could sit with 
her legs extended and reach her toes. With the 
entire class spontaneously applauding, Heather 
cried again, but this time out of joy.

Part II: Postures for Health Maintenance and Restoration 
 
✓ When you come up out of a standing forward bend, choose one of 
three ways:
 
• The easiest and safest way is to roll your body up like a rag doll, 
stacking your vertebrae one on top of other with your head coming 
up last.
 
• The next level of difficulty is to bring your arms up from the sides 
like wings as you inhale and raise your back.
 
• The third and most challenging way is to start with the inhala-
tion and extend your arms forward and up along side of the ears. 
Then continue raising the upper, mid, and lower back until you’re 
straight up and your arms are overhead if possible.
Mountain posture: Tadasana
The mountain posture is the foundation for all the standing postures. 
Tadasana aligns the body, improves posture and balance, and facilitates 
breathing. Although this exercise is commonly called the mountain posture, 
the name for this position is actually “palm posture,” from the Sanskrit word 
tada (pronounced tah-dah). Some authorities also refer to this exercise as the 
tree posture. Here’s how it works:
 
1. Stand tall but relaxed with your feet at hip width (down from the sits 
bones, not the outer curves) and hang your arms at your sides, palms 
turned toward your legs.
 
 The sits bones, also know as the ischial tuberosity, are the bony parts 
your feel underneath you when you sit up straight on a firm surface.
 
2. Visualize a vertical line connecting the opening in your ear, your 
shoulder joint, and the sides of your hip, knee, and ankle.
 
 Look straight ahead, with your eyes open or closed as shown in Figure 7-1.
 
3. Remain in this posture for 6 to 8 breaths.
Note: In the classic version of this posture, the feet are together, and the chin 
rests on the chest.

Standing forward bend: Uttanasana
The Sanskrit word uttana (pronounced oo-tah-nah) means “extended,” and 
this posture certainly fits that bill. The standing forward bend (see Figure 7-2) 
stretches the entire back of the body and decompresses the neck (makes 
space between the vertebrae). In the upright posture, the cervical spine and 
the neck muscles work hard to balance the head. Because most people gen-
erally don’t pay enough attention to this part of their anatomy, they tend to 
accumulate a lot of tension in their necks, which can lead to headaches. This 
posture frees the cervical spine and allows the neck muscles to relax. It also 
improves overall circulation and has a calming effect on the body and mind. 
The following steps walk you through the process.

100
Part II: Postures for Health Maintenance and Restoration 
 
Be very careful of all forward bends if you’re having a disc problem. If you’re 
unsure, check with your doctor or health professional.
 
1. Start in mountain posture and as you inhale, raise your arms forward 
and then up overhead (see Figure 7-2a).
 
2. As you exhale, bend forward from your hips.
 
 When you feel a pull in the back of your legs, soften your knees (as in 
the Forgiving Limbs discussion in Chapter 3) and hang your arms.
 
3. If your head isn’t close to your knees, bend your knees more.
 
 If you have the flexibility, straighten your knees but keep them soft. 
Relax your head and neck downward as Figure 7-2b illustrates.
 
4. As you inhale, roll up slowly, stacking the bones of your spine one at 
a time from bottom to top and then raise your arms overhead.
 
 Rolling is the safest way to come up. If you don’t have back problems, 
after a few weeks you may want to try the two more advanced tech-
niques we discuss earlier in the section.
 
5. Repeat Steps 1 through 4 three times and then stay in the folded posi-
tion (Step 3) for 6 to 8 breaths.
Note: In the classic posture, the feet are together and the legs are straight. 
The forehead presses against the shins, and the palms are on the floor.

 Chapter 7: Standing Tall
Half standing forward bend: 
Ardha uttanasana
The Sanskrit word ardha (pronounced ahrd-ha) means “half.” The half stand-
ing forward bend strengthens your legs, back, shoulders, and arms and 
improves stamina. Here’s how you do it:
 
1. Start in the mountain posture and as you inhale, raise your arms for-
ward and then up overhead as in the standing forward bend (see the 
preceding section).
 
2. As you exhale, bend forward from your hips.
 
 Soften your knees and hang your arms.
 
3. Bend your knees, and as you inhale, raise your torso and arms up from 
the front so that they’re parallel to the floor as shown in Figure 7-3.
 
 If you have any back problems, keep your arms back by your sides, and 
then over a period of time gradually stretch them out to the sides like a 
T and eventually in front of you so they’re parallel to the floor.
 
4. Bring your head to a neutral position so that your ears are between 
your arms.
 
 Look down and a little forward. To make the posture easier, move your 
arms back toward your hips — the further back, the easier.
 
5. Repeat Steps 1 through 4 three times and then stay in Step 4 for 6 to 8 
breaths.

Part II: Postures for Health Maintenance and Restoration 
Note: In the classical version of this posture, the feet are together and the 
legs and arms are straight.
Asymmetrical forward bend: 
Parshva uttanasana
The asymmetrical forward bend stretches each side of the back and ham-
strings separately. The Sanskrit word parshva (pronounced pahr-shvah) 
means “side” or “flank,” and this posture indeed opens the hips, tones the 
abdomen, decompresses the neck, improves balance, and increases circula-
tion to the upper torso and head.
 
1. Stand in the mountain posture and as you exhale, step forward 
about 3 to 31⁄2 feet (or the length of one leg) with your right foot.
 
 Your left foot turns out naturally, but if you need more stability turn it 
out more (so that the toes point to the left.)
 
2. Place your hands on the top of your hips and square the front of your 
pelvis; release your hands and hang your arms.
 
3. As you inhale, raise your arms forward and then overhead as shown 
in Figure 7-4a.
 
4. As you exhale, bend forward from the hips, soften your right knee 
and both arms, and hang down as Figure 7-4b illustrates.
 
 If your head isn’t close to your right knee, bend your knee more. If you 
have the flexibility, straighten your right knee but keep it soft.

 Chapter 7: Standing Tall
 
5. As you inhale, roll up slowly, stacking the bones of your spine one at 
a time from the bottom up, and then raise your arms overhead.
 
 Relax your head and neck downward. Rolling up is the safest way to come 
up but if you don’t have back problems, you may want to try the more 
advanced techniques we cover earlier in the section after a few weeks.
 
6. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 three times and then stay in Step 4 for 6 to 8 breaths.
 
 Repeat the same sequence on the left side.
Note: In the classic version of this posture, both legs are straight and the 
forehead presses against the forward leg.
 
To make the posture more challenging, square your hips forward and rotate 
your back foot inward.
Triangle posture: Utthita trikonasana
The Sanskrit word utthita (pronounced oot-hee-tah) means “raised” and 
trikona (pronounced tree-ko-nah) means “triangle.” The latter term is often 
mispronounced as try-ko-nah. The triangle posture stretches the sides of your 
spine, the backs of your legs, and your hips. It also stretches the muscles 
between your ribs (the intercostals), which opens the chest and improves 
breathing capacity. Just follow these steps:
 
1. Stand in the mountain posture, exhale, and step out to the right 
about 3 to 31⁄2 feet (or the length of one leg) with your right foot.
 
2. Turn your right foot out 90 degrees and your left foot 45 degrees.
 
 An imaginary line drawn from the right heel (toward the left foot) should 
bisect the arch of the left foot.
 
3. Face forward and, as you inhale, raise your arms out to the sides par-
allel to the line of the shoulders (and the floor) so that they form a T 
with the torso (see Figure 7-5a).
 
4. As you exhale, reach your right hand down to your right shin as close 
to the ankle as is comfortable for you and then reach and lift your left 
arm up.
 
 Bend your right knee slightly as shown in Figure 7-5b if the back of your 
leg feels tight. As much as you can, bring the sides of your torso parallel 
to the floor.
 
5. Soften your left arm and look up at your left hand.
 
 If your neck hurts, look down or halfway down at the floor.

104
Part II: Postures for Health Maintenance and Restoration 
 
6. Repeat Steps 3 through 5 three times and then stay in Step 5 for 6 to 8 
breaths.
 
 Repeat the same sequence on the left side.
Note: In the classic version of this posture, the feet are parallel, the arms and 
legs are straight, and the trunk is parallel to the floor. The right hand is on 
the floor outside the right foot.

Reverse triangle posture: 
Parivritta trikonasana
The Sanskrit word parivritta (pronounced pah-ree-vree-tah) means “revolved,” 
which makes perfect sense with this posture. The action of twists, including 
the reverse triangle, on the discs between the spinal vertebrae (interverte-
bral discs) is often compared to squeezing and then releasing a wet sponge: 
First you squeeze the dirty water out and then you sponge up the clean 
water. The twisting-untwisting action increases circulation of fresh blood to 
these discs and keeps them supple as you grow older. The reverse triangle 
also stretches the backs of your legs, opens your hips, and strengthens your 
neck, shoulders, and arms. Here’s how it works:
 
1. Standing in the mountain posture, exhale and step the right foot out to 
the right about 3 to 31⁄2 feet (or the length of one leg).
 
2. As you inhale, raise your arms out to the sides parallel to the line of 
the shoulders (and the floor) so that they form a T with the torso as 
Figure 7-6a illustrates.

105
 Chapter 7: Standing Tall
 
3. As you exhale, bend forward from the hips and then place the right 
hand on the floor near the inside of the left foot.
 
4. Raise your left arm toward the ceiling and look up at your left hand.
 
 Soften your knees and your arms. Bend your left knee or move your 
right hand away from your left foot (and more directly under your torso) 
as in Figure 7-6b if necessary. If you feel neck strain, turn your head 
toward the floor.
 
5. Repeat Steps 2 through 4 three times and then stay in Step 4 for 6 to 8 
breaths.
 
 Repeat the same sequence on the left side.

Note: In the classic version of this posture, the feet are parallel and the legs

rests lightly outside the opposite side foot.
Warrior I: Vira bhadrasana I
The Sanskrit word vira (pronounced vee-rah) is often translated as “hero” 
and bhadra (pronounced bhud-rah) means “auspicious.” This posture, also 
known as just warrior, strengthens your legs, back, shoulders, and arms; 
opens your hips, groin, and chest; increases strength and stamina; and 
improves balance. As its name suggests, this posture instills a feeling of fear-
lessness and inner strength. The following steps get you going:

106
Part II: Postures for Health Maintenance and Restoration 
 
1. Stand in the mountain posture and as you exhale, step forward 
approximately 3 to 3 1⁄2 feet (or the length of one leg) with your right 
foot (see Figure 7-7a).
 
 Your left foot turns out naturally, but if you need more stability, turn it 
out more (so that your toes point to the left).
 
2. Place your hands on the top of your hips and square the front of your 
pelvis; release your hands and hang your arms.
 
3. As you inhale, raise your arms forward and overhead and bend your 
right knee to a right angle (so that the knee is directly over the ankle 
and the thigh is parallel to the floor) as shown in Figure 7-7b.
 
 If your lower back is uncomfortable, lean the torso slightly over the for-
ward leg until you feel a release of tension in your back.
 
4. As you exhale, return to the starting place in Figure 7-7a; soften 
your arms and face your palms toward each other, looking straight 
ahead.
 
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 three times and then stay in Step 3 for 6 to 8 
breaths.
 
6. Repeat Steps 1 through 5 on the left side.

Warrior II: Vira bhadrasana II
Like the warrior I posture we cover in the preceding section, warrior II also 
strengthens your legs, back, shoulders, and arms. It focuses more on your 
hips and groin and increases strength and stamina; it also improves balance. 
Use the following steps as your guide.
 
1. Stand in the mountain posture; exhale, and step out to the right 
about 3 to 31⁄2 feet (or the length of one leg) with your right foot.
 
2. Turn your right foot out 90 degrees and your left foot 45 degrees.
 
 An imaginary line drawn from your right heel toward your left foot 
should bisect the arch of your left foot.
 
3. Face forward and, as you inhale, raise your arms out to the sides par-
allel to the line of the shoulders (and the floor) so that they form a T 
with the torso (see Figure 7-8a).
 
4. As you exhale, turn your right foot out out 90 degrees and bend your 
right knee over your right ankle so that your shin is perpendicular to 
the floor as shown in see Figure 7-8b.
 
 If possible, bring the right thigh parallel to the floor.
 
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 three times, keeping your arms in a T, and then 
turn your head to the right, looking out over your right arm, and stay 
for 6 to 8 breaths.
 
6. Repeat Steps 1 through 5 on the left side.
 
Be careful not to force your hips open — it may cause problems with your 
knees (and you don’t want that!).

Standing spread-legged forward bend: 
Prasarita pada uttanasana
The Sanskrit word prasarita (pronounced prah-sah-ree-tah) means “out-
stretched” and pada, (pronounced pah-dah) means “foot.” This posture, also 
called the wide-legged standing forward bend, stretches your hamstrings and 
your adductors (on insides of the thighs) and opens your hips. The hanging 
forward bend increases circulation to your upper torso and lengthens your 
spine. Figure 7-9 shows you this posture; here’s how you do it:
 
1. Stand in the mountain posture, exhale, and step your right foot out to 
the right about 3 to 31⁄2 feet (or the length of one leg).
 
2. As you inhale, raise your arms out to the sides parallel to the line of 
your shoulders (and the floor) so they form a T with your torso.
 
3. As you exhale, bend forward from the hips and soften your knees.
 
4. Hold your bent elbows with the opposite-side hands and hang your 
torso and arms.
 
5. Stay in Step 4 for 6 to 8 breaths.

 Chapter 7: Standing Tall
Note: In the classic version of this posture, the legs are straight, the head 
is on the floor (and the chin presses the chest), and the arms reach back 
between the legs, palms on the floor.
Half chair posture: Ardha utkatasana
The Sanskrit word ardha (pronounced ahrd-ha) means “half,” and utkata, 
(pronounced oot-kah-tah) translates as “extraordinary.” The half chair pos-
ture strengthens the back, legs, shoulders, and arms and builds overall stam-
ina. If you find this posture difficult or have problem knees, you may want to 
skip this position for now and return to it after your leg muscles become a 
little stronger. Don’t overdo this exercise (either by holding the position too 
long or by repeating it more than we recommend), or you’ll have sore mus-
cles the next day. But there’s no harm in experiencing some muscle soreness 
either, especially if you haven’t exercised in a long time. Check out Figure 7-10 
and the following steps for guidance.
 
1. Start in the mountain posture and as you inhale, raise your arms for-
ward and up overhead with palms facing each other.
 
2. As you exhale, bend your knees and squat halfway to the floor.

3. Soften your arms but keep them overhead.
 
 Look straight ahead.
 
4. Repeat Steps 1 through 3 three times and then stay in Step 3 for 6 to 8 
breaths.
Note: In the classic version of this posture, the feet are together and the arms 
are straight, with the fingers interlocked and the palms turned upward. The 
chin rests on the chest.
Downward-facing dog: Adhomukha 
shvanasana
The Sanskrit word adhomukha (pronounced ahd-ho-mook-hah) means “down-
ward facing,” and shvan (pronounced shvahn) means “dog.” Yoga masters 
were great observers of the world around them. They particularly noticed 
the behavior of animals, which is why the dog’s leisurely stretching inspired 
them to create a similar posture for humans. The practice of downward-facing 
dog stretches the entire back of your body, and strengthens your wrists, 
arms, and shoulders. This posture is a good alternative for beginning stu-
dents who aren’t yet ready for inversions like the handstand and headstand. 
Because the head is lower than the heart, this asana circulates fresh blood to 
the brain and acts as a quick pick-me-up when you’re fatigued.
 
1. Start on your hands and knees; straighten your arms, but don’t lock 
your elbows (see Figure 7-11a).
 
 Be sure that the heels of your hands are directly under your shoulders, 
with your palms on the floor with the fingers spread and your knees 
directly under your hips. Emphasize pressing down with the thumbs and 
index fingers or the inner web of your hand.
 
2. As you exhale, lift and straighten (but don’t lock) your knees.
 
 As your hips lift, bring your head to a neutral position so that your ears 
are between your arms.
 
3. Press your heels toward the floor and your head toward your feet as 
in Figure 7-11b.
 
 Don’t complete this step if doing so strains your neck.
 
4. Repeat Steps 1 through 3 three times and then stay in Step 3 for 6 to 8 
breaths.
Note: In the classic posture, the feet are together and flat on the floor, the 
legs and arms are straight, and the top of the head is on the floor with the 
chin pressed to the chest.

Steady as a Tree: 
Mastering Balance
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding the psychology of balance
▶ Practicing balancing exercises
B
alance (called samata [sah-mah-tah] or samatva [sah-mah-tvah] in 
Sanskrit) is fundamental to Yoga. A balanced approach to life includes 
being even-tempered and seeing the great unity behind all diversity. Balance 
translates to being nonjudgmental and treating others with equal fairness, 
kindness, and compassion.
One way to begin to gain this balance is to practice balancing postures. 
Remember, according to Yoga, body and mind form a working unit. 
Imbalances in the body are reflected in the mind, and vice versa. This chap-
ter emphasizes the importance of balance in Yoga and offers six postures 
that provide you with a samata sampling.
Getting to the Roots of the Posture
When you look at a tree, you see only what is above ground — the vertical 
trunk with its crown of branches and foliage and maybe a few chirping birds. 
Trees appear to just perch atop the soil, and you wonder how in the world 
such a top-heavy thing can stay upright.
Well, everyone knows that the secret of the tree’s equilibrium is its under-
ground network of roots that anchor the visible part of the plant solidly into 
the earth. In the balancing postures, you too can discover how to grow your 
“roots” into the earth and stand up as steady as a tree.
For us, the balancing postures can be the most fun and the most dramatic 
of all the postures. Although they’re relatively simple, the postures can pro-
duce profound effects. As you may expect, they work to improve your overall 

114
Part II: Postures for Health Maintenance and Restoration 
sense of physical balance, coordination, and grounding. With awareness in 
these three areas, you can move more easily and effectively, whether you’re 
going about your daily business or are engaged in activities calling for great 
coordination, such as sports or dance. The yogic balancing postures also 
have therapeutic applications, such as with back problems or retraining 
whole muscle groups.
 
When you improve your physical balance naturally, you can expect to enjoy 
improved mental balance. The balancing postures are exceptional seeds for 
concentration, and when they’re mastered, they create confidence and a 
sense of accomplishment.
Balancing Postures for Graceful Strength
Contemporary life is highly demanding and stressful; if you’re not properly 
grounded, you face a constant risk of being pushed out of balance. Grounding 
means being centered and firm without being inflexible, knowing who you are 
and what you want, and feeling that you’re empowered to achieve your life 
goals. A good way to begin your grounding work is by improving your physi-
cal sense of balance, which helps you synchronize the movement of your 
arms and legs, giving you poise. When you can stand and move in a more bal-
anced manner, your mind is automatically affected. You feel more balanced.
A sense of balance is connected with the inner ears. Your ears tell you where 
you are in space. The ears are also connected with social space; if you aren’t 
well-balanced, you may feel — or actually be — a bit awkward in your social 
relationships. Balancing and grounding work can remedy this discomfort. 
Only when you can stand still — in balance — can you also move harmoni-
ously in the world.
The following postures appear in order of easier to more advanced exer-
cises. If you try the postures individually rather than as part of a sequence, 
we recommend that you hold each posture for 6 to 8 breaths. Breathe freely 
through the nose and pause briefly after inhalation and exhalation.
Warrior at the wall: Vira 
bhadrasana III variation
The Sanskrit word vira (pronounced vee-rah) means “hero.” Bhadra (pronounced 
bhud-rah) means “auspicious.” This posture improves your overall balance 
and stability. It strengthens the legs, arms, and shoulders and stretches the 
thighs — both front and back — and the hips. As with the other one-legged 
balancing poses, this posture enhances focus and concentration. Check out 
the following steps:

115
 Chapter 8: Steady as a Tree: Mastering Balance
 
1. Stand in the mountain posture (see Chapter 7), facing a blank wall 
about three feet away.
 
2. As you exhale, bend forward from the hips and extend your arms for-
ward until your fingertips are touching the wall.
 
 Adjust yourself so that your legs are perpendicular and your torso and 
arms are parallel with the floor.
 
3. As you inhale, raise your left leg back and up until it’s parallel to the 
floor (see Figure 8-1).
 
4. Stay in Step 3 for 6 to 8 breaths; repeat with the right leg.
 
Figure 8-1: 
A safe 
balancing 
posture for 
beginners.
 
Balancing cat
Balancing cat strengthens the muscles along the spine (the paraspinals), 
as well as the arms, and the shoulders, and it opens the hips. The posture 
enhances focus and concentration and also builds confidence.
 
1. Beginning on your hands and knees, position your hands directly 
under your shoulders with your palms down, your fingers spread on 
the floor, and your knees directly under your hips.
 
 Straighten your arms, but don’t lock your elbows.
 
2. As you exhale, slide your left hand forward and your right leg back, 
keeping your hand and your toes on the floor.

116
Part II: Postures for Health Maintenance and Restoration 
 
3. As you inhale, raise your left arm and right leg to a comfortable 
height as Figure 8-2 illustrates.
 
4. Stay in Step 3 for 6 to 8 breaths and then repeat Steps 1 through 3 
with opposite pairs (right arm and left leg).
 
This posture is a variation of cakravakasana (pronounced chuk-rah-vahk-ah-
sah-nah). The cakravaka is a particular kind of goose, which in India’s tradi-
tional poetry is often used to convey “love bird.” Apparently, when these birds 
have paired up and then are separated, their heartache causes them to call to 
each other.
 
Figure 8-2: 
Extend your 
arm and 
leg fully on 
the ground 
before you

The tree posture: Vrikshasana
The Sanskrit word vriksha (pronounced vrik-shah) means “tree.” The tree 
posture improves overall balance, stability, and poise. It strengthens your 
legs, arms, and shoulders, and opens your hips and groin. Like the other one-
legged balancing poses, it also enhances focus and concentration and pro-
duces a calming effect on your body and mind. Here’s how it works:
 
1. Stand in the mountain posture (covered in Chapter 7).
 
2. As you exhale, bend your right knee and place the sole of your right 
foot, toes pointing down, on the inside of your left leg between your 
knee and your groin.
 
3. As you inhale, bring your arms over your head and join your palms 
together.

117
 Chapter 8: Steady as a Tree: Mastering Balance
 
4. Soften your arms and focus on a spot 6 to 8 feet in front of you on the 
floor as shown in Figure 8-3.
 
5. Stay in Step 4 for 6 to 8 breaths and then repeat with the opposite leg.
Note: In the classic (traditionally taught) version of this posture, the arms are 
straight and the chin rests on the chest.

The karate kid
The karate kid improves overall balance and stability. It strengthens the legs, 
arms, and shoulders and opens the hips. As with the other one-legged balanc-
ing postures, the karate kid enhances focus and concentration. Just follow 
these steps:
 
1. Stand in the mountain posture, which we describe in Chapter 7.
 
2. As you inhale, raise your arms out to the sides parallel to the line of 
your shoulders (and the floor) so that they form a T with your torso.
 
3. To steady yourself, focus on a spot on the floor 10 to 12 feet in front 
of you.

118
Part II: Postures for Health Maintenance and Restoration 
 
4. As you exhale, bend your left knee, raising it toward your chest.
 
 Keep your right leg straight (see Figure 8-4).
 
5. Stay in Step 4 for 6 to 8 breaths; repeat with the right knee.
 
Figure 8-4:

The Sanskrit name for this pose would be “utthita hasta padangusthasana 
variation.” I (Larry) called it the karate kid based on inspiration from the film 
The Karate Kid, Part II.
Standing heel-to-buttock
The standing heel-to-buttock posture improves your overall balance and sta-
bility. This posture strengthens your legs, arms, and shoulders and stretches 
your thighs. As with the other one-legged balancing poses, this posture 
enhances focus and concentration. Here’s how it works
 
1. Stand in the mountain posture (see Chapter 7).
 
2. As you inhale, raise your left arm forward and overhead.

119
 Chapter 8: Steady as a Tree: Mastering Balance
 
3. To steady yourself, focus on a spot on the floor 10 to 12 feet in front of you.
 
4. As you exhale, bend your right knee and bring your right heel toward 
your right buttock, keeping your left leg straight.
 
 Grasp your right ankle with the right hand as Figure 8-5 illustrates.
 
5. Stay in Step 4 for 6 to 8 breaths; repeat Steps 1 through 5 with your 
left foot.

Scorpion
The scorpion posture improves overall balance and stability. This posture, 
which is a variation of cakravakasana, strengthens your shoulders, improves 
the flexibility of your hips, legs, and shoulders, and enhances focus and con-
centration. The following steps walk you through the process:
 
1. While on your hands and knees, position your hands directly under 
your shoulders with your palms down, fingers spread on the floor, 
and your knees directly under your hips.
 
 Straighten your arms, but don’t lock your elbows.

2. Place your right forearm on the floor with your right hand just behind 
your left wrist.
 
 Reach behind you with your left hand, twisting the torso slightly to the 
left, and grab your right ankle.
 
3. As you inhale, lift your right knee off the floor, raise your chest until 
it’s parallel to the floor, and look up.
 
 Find a comfortable height for your chest and raised leg. Steady yourself 
by pressing your right forearm and thumb on the floor (see Figure 8-6).
 
4. Stay in Step 3 for 6 to 8 breaths and then repeat Steps 1 through 4 on 
the opposite side (left forearm and left foot).

▶ Sounding off during exhalation
M
any Eastern systems of spiritual exercise and healing consider the 
lower abdomen to be the vital center of your whole being — body, 
mind, and spirit. Westerners, on the other hand, think much differently about 
their bellies, tending to see them as mere food bags or as waste processing 
stations.
Many people have a love-hate relationship with their bellies. Although people 
may be obsessed with having the “perfect” midriff, they tend to neglect or 
even abuse this area of their bodies. On the inside, they stuff the belly with 
way too much junk food. On the outside, they let it grow slack. But, as the 
Yoga masters warn, when this area is polluted by impurities, it becomes a 
seat of sickness.
Apart from diseases, weak bellies (and belly muscles) contribute significantly 
to lower back problems. Studies indicate that 80 percent of the American 
population has had, is having, or will have back problems, and that back-
related problems are the second-leading cause of missed workdays, trailing 
only respiratory problems or the common cold.
In this chapter, we walk you through some Yoga exercises that focus on 
the abdomen so that you can keep this vital area of your body strong and 
healthy.

122
Part II: Postures for Health Maintenance and Restoration 
Taking Care of the Abdomen: 
Your Business Center
The abdomen is an amazing enterprise, with its complex food-processing 
plant (the stomach), several subsidiary operations (liver, spleen, kidneys, 
and so on), and a 25-foot-long sewer system (the intestines). Poor diets and 
eating habits lead to annoying and sometimes deadly serious digestive and 
elimination problems, including constipation, diarrhea, irritable bowel syn-
drome, and colon cancer. Regular Yoga practice can help you take care of 
your abdominal organs so they can function well and take care of you with-
out the aid of antacids, digestive enzyme supplements, or laxatives.
In the following section, we describe exercises that work with three sets of 
abdominal muscles:
 
✓ The rectus abdominis, which is strung vertically along the front of the 
belly from the bottom of the sternum to the pubis
 
✓ The internal and external obliques, which, as their name suggests, take 
an “oblique” course along the side of the belly from the lower ribs to the 
top rim of the pelvis
 
✓ The transversalis abdominis, which lies behind the internal obliques
You may hear these three abdominals called the “stomach muscles,” which is 
really a misnomer. The actual stomach muscles line the baglike stomach and 
are active only during digestion. Of course, the yogic exercises also positively 
affect the abdominal organs (stomach, spleen, liver, and intestines). If you 
take care of your abdominal muscles and the organs they protect — through 
exercise and proper diet — you have accomplished 90 percent of the work to 
stay healthy.
Navel secrets, declassified
After a doctor severs a child’s umbilical cord, 
thus creating his navel, no one pays much atten-
tion to this birth socket. Yet the navel is a very 
important feature of your anatomy. According 
to Yoga, a special psychoenergetic center is 
located at the navel. This center is known as the 
manipura-cakra (pronounced mah-nee-poo-
rah-chuk-rah), which means literally “center 
of the jeweled city.” The center corresponds to 
(but isn’t identical with) the solar plexus, which 
is a large network of nerves that has been 
called the body’s second brain. The manipura-
cakra controls the abdominal organs and regu-
lates the flow of energy through the entire body. 
The navel center is associated with emotions 
and the will. You can have “too much navel” (be 
pushy) or “not enough navel” (be a pushover).

123
 Chapter 9: Absolutely Abs
Exercising Those Abs
 
Our yogic postures for the abdominal muscles incorporate a team approach 
that values slow, conscious movement, proper breathing mechanics, and the 
use of sound. The emphasis here is on the quality of the movement rather than 
sheer quantity. A few movements done with diligent attention are much safer 
and more effective than dozens and even hundreds of mindless repetitions. 
Conscious breathing, especially the gentle tightening of the front belly on 
each exhalation, can encourage and then sustain the strength and tone of the 
abdominals. The use of sound, which we discuss later in this chapter, further 
enhances this kind of breathing.
Exploring push-downs
 
Push-downs strengthen the abdomen, especially the lower abdomen. In 
addition to a floor exercise, you can do push-downs in a seated position by 
pushing your lower back against the back of your chair. You can perform this 
exercise sitting in a car, on a plane, or at the office.
 
1. Lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet on the floor at 
hip width.
 
 Rest your arms near your sides, palms down.
 
2. As you exhale, push your lower back down to the floor for 3 to 5 sec-
onds (see Figure 9-1).
 
3. As you inhale, release your back.
 
4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 six to eight times.

Trying yogi sit-ups
Yogi sit-ups strengthen the abdomen, especially the upper abdomen, the 
adductors (insides of your legs), the neck, and the shoulders.
 
1. Lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet on the floor at 
hip width.
 
2. Turn your toes in “pigeon-toed” and bring your inner knees together.
 
3. Spread your palms on the back of your head with your fingers inter-
locked and keep your elbows wide.
 
4. As you exhale, press your knees firmly, tilt the front of your pelvis 
toward your navel, and with your hips on the ground, slowly sit up 
halfway.
 
 Keep your elbows out to the sides in line with the tops of your shoul-
ders. Look toward the ceiling. Don’t pull your head up with your arms; 
rather, support your head with your hands and come up by contracting 
the abdominal muscles as shown in Figure 9-2.
 
5. As you inhale, slowly roll back down.
 
6. Repeat Steps 4 and 5 six to eight times.

Strengthening with yogi sit-backs
Yogi sit-backs strengthen both the lower and upper abdomen. This posture is 
a variation of navasana. The Sanskrit word nava, pronounced nah-vah, means 
“boat.”
 
1. Sit on the floor with your knees bent and your feet on the floor at 
hip width.
 
2. Place your hands on the floor, palms down, near your hips.
 
3. Bring your chin down and round your back in a C curve like in 
Figure 9-3a.
 
4. As you inhale, roll slowly onto the back of your pelvis, dragging your 
hands along on the floor as shown in Figure 9-3b.
 
 Keep the rest of your back off the floor to maintain the contraction of 
the abdominals, but don’t strain to hold this position; if you have any 
negative symptoms, don’t use this posture.
 
5. As you exhale, roll up again, sliding your hands forward.
 
6. Repeat Steps 4 and 5 six to eight times.

The sound of Yoga
A very busy, well-known movie producer from 
Malibu was referred to me (Larry) by his phy-
sician. He suffered from a chronic neck and 
stress condition, and also had what his girlfriend 
referred to as a “little jelly belly.” Regular sit-
ups to tighten his abs just aggravated his neck 
problem. I gave him a 12-minute, twice-a-day 
Yoga routine that included the yogi sit-back 
and the use of sound (both discussed in this 
chapter). The exercises worked like a charm. 
His neck problem went away, his belly firmed 
up nicely. He liked using sound so much that 
many members of his movie crew joined him in 
the afternoon for “a little sound.”

126
Part II: Postures for Health Maintenance and Restoration 
 
Sit-backs are easier on the neck than most sit-ups. However, if you have lower 
back problems, be cautious with sit-backs. If you notice any pain in your back, 
just stop. Work with the other exercises in this chapter instead.
Creating variety with 
extended leg slide-ups
A variation of navasana, the extended leg slide-ups strengthen both the 
upper and lower abdomen as well as the neck.
 
If this pose bothers your neck, support your head by putting both hands 
behind it. If the problem persists, stop.
 
1. Lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet flat on the floor 
at hip width.
 
2. Bend your left elbow and place your left hand on the back of your 
head just behind your left ear.
 
3. Raise the left leg as close to vertical (90 degrees) as possible, but keep 
your knee slightly bent.
 
4. Draw the top of your foot toward your shin to flex your ankle and 
place your right palm on your right thigh near your pelvis as 
Figure 9-4a illustrates.
 
5. As you exhale, sit up slowly halfway and slide your right hand toward 
your knee.
 
 Keep your left elbow back in line with your shoulder and look at the ceiling. 
Don’t throw your head forward (see Figure 9-4b for the proper positioning).
 
6. Repeat Steps 1 through 5 six to eight times and then repeat Steps 1 
through 6 on the other side.

Arching with the suck ’em up posture
 
The suck ’em up posture strengthens and tones the abdominal muscles 
and the internal organs. The posture is especially beneficial for relieving 
constipation.
 
1. Start on your hands and knees with your hands just below your shoul-
ders and your knees at hip width.
 
2. Inhale deeply through your nose.
 
3. Exhale through your mouth and hump your back like a camel as you 
bring your chin down.
 
 When you have fully exhaled, don’t immediately inhale; hold your 
breath where it is and then suck your belly up towards your spine (see 
Figure 9-5).
 
 Wait two to three seconds with the belly up and breath restrained, pro-
viding you don’t end up gasping for air.
 
4. As you inhale, return to the starting position and then pause for a 
breath or two.
 
5. Repeat Steps 2 through 4 four to six times, pausing for a breath or two 
between each repetition.
 
Do this exercise only on an empty stomach, and avoid it if you’re having stom-
ach pain or cramps of any kind because it may intensify the symptoms. Avoid 
this exercise during menstruation.

Exhaling “soundly”
The use of sound exercise strengthens and tones the abdomen and its inter-
nal organs in addition to strengthening the muscles of the diaphragm.
 
1. Sit in a chair or on the floor with your spine comfortably upright.
 
 If you find yourself slumping, sit on a folded blanket or check out the 
Yoga props in Chapter 19.
 
2. Place the palm of your right hand on your navel so that you can feel 
your belly contracting as you exhale.
 
3. Take a deep inhalation through your nose and, as you exhale, make 
the sound ah, ma, or sa.
 
 Continue sounding this consonant for as long as you can do so 
comfortably.
 
4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 six to eight times.
 
 Pause for a resting breath or two between each sound.
 
If you’re on a detox program of any kind and the use of sound gives you a 
headache, work with the other exercises in this chapter instead.

Chapter 10
Looking at the World Upside Down
In This Chapter
▶ Making heads or tails of the yogic principle of reversal
▶ Working with leg inversions
▶ Gravitating toward shoulder stands
T
housands of years ago, the Yoga masters made an amazing discovery: By 
tricking the force of gravity with the help of inversion exercises, you can 
reverse the effects of aging, improve your health, and add years to your life.
To picture how inversions work, take a look at a jug of unfiltered apple juice 
sitting on the grocery store shelf. Gravity has pulled the solids in the juice 
to the bottom of the jug, diluting the liquid near the top. If you turn the 
bottle upside down, gravity pulls the bottom sediment toward the top of the 
inverted jug, remixing the juice with the pulp of the apples.
In a similar way, when you turn yourself upside down, the sediments — 
mostly blood and lymph (a clear yellowish fluid similar to blood plasma) — 
that have collected in your lower limbs during a long day of uprightness sink 
toward your head and revitalize your entire body and mind, helping you face 
your fears and reversing the tide of stagnation and mental negativity.
The idea that you must practice the headstand to be a “real yogi” just isn’t 
true. We recommend that you avoid the headstand unless an experienced 
teacher supervises your efforts. The neck is designed to support the 8 
pounds of the head, not the 100 or more pounds of the body. Approach the 
headstand cautiously and only after proper preparation.
Fortunately, you can practice a variety of inversions other than the head-
stand. In this chapter, we describe inverted exercises that impart the benefits 

130
Part II: Postures for Health Maintenance and Restoration 
without the risk. Use yogic breathing (see Chapter 5) to boost their beneficial 
effect, and grab a prop as necessary to facilitate the postures and ensure 
easy breathing (see Chapter 19).
Getting a Leg Up on Leg Inversions
Effective inversions can actually be quite simple. In the section below, we 
describe four postures that don’t require you to literally turn yourself upside 
down in order to enjoy the numerous benefits of an inversion.
 
Avoid all inverted postures if you have an acute headache or if you experience 
sudden pain while performing the exercise.
Legs up on a chair
 
The legs up on a chair posture improves circulation to your legs, hips, and 
lower back and has a calming effect on your nervous system. It also helps alle-
viate symptoms of PMS in women and prostatitis in men.
To enjoy these benefits, do the following:
 
1. Sit on the floor in a simple cross-legged position facing a sturdy chair 
and then lean back onto your forearms.
 
2. Slide your buttocks along the floor toward the chair until they’re just 
under the front edge of the chair seat.
 
3. While exhaling, lift your feet off the floor and place your heels and 
calves on the chair seat.
 
 Make sure that the front edge of the seat is close to the backs of your knees.
 
4. Lie back on the floor with your arms near your sides, palms down or 
up as shown in Figure 10-1.
 
5. Stay in Step 4 for 2 to 10 minutes.
 
This posture is a variation of the classic (traditionally taught) posture of 
urdhva prasarita padasana (pronounced oord-hvah prah-sah-ree-tah pahd-ah-
sah-nah) which means “upward extended foot posture.”

Legs up on the wall
 
Legs up on the wall, which is a variation of urdhva prasarita padasana, 
improves circulation to the legs, hips, and lower back and has a calming effect 
on the nervous system. It also helps alleviate symptoms of PMS in women and 
prostatitis in men.
Try it for yourself by following these steps:
 
1. Sit sideways with your right side as close to the wall as possible, with 
both legs extended forward as Figure 10-2a illustrates.
 
2. As you exhale, swing both legs up on the wall and lie flat on your 
back.
 
 Extend your legs up as far as possible. Extend your arms out comfort-
ably at your sides, palms down, and relax (see Figure 10-2b).
 
3. Stay in Step 2 for 2 to 10 minutes.

The Happy Baby
A variation of urdhva prasarita padasana, Happy Baby improves circulation in 
the legs, arms, hips, and lower back, and has a calming effect on the nervous 
system. It also improves the range of motion of the ankles, toes, wrists, and 
fingers.
Here’s how it works:
 
1. Lying on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor, 
place your arms at your sides with your palms down.
 
2. As you exhale, extend your legs and arms up vertically.
 
 Keep your limbs relaxed (check out our discussion of Forgiving Limbs in 
Chapter 3) as you hold them up.
 
3. With your feet, toes, hands, and fingers draw circles in the air both 
clockwise and counterclockwise as in Figure 10-3.
 
 You can make your hands and feet go in different directions at the same 
time. Breathe freely. Keep your arms and legs up as long as you feel 
comfortable and then return to the starting position.

4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 three to five times, but don’t hold the limbs up 
for more than a total of 5 minutes; you don’t want to tire yourself out 
or strain your back.
 
Avoid this posture if you have lower back problems.
Standing spread-legged forward 
bend at the wall
The standing wide-legged forward bend at the wall, which is a variation of 
prasarita pada uttanasana (described in Chapter 7), improves circulation in 
your head and stretches your spine and hamstrings.
Follow these easy steps:
 
1. Stand with your back 2 to 3 feet from a sturdy wall, separate your 
feet to a comfortably wide stance, and then lean your buttocks back 
against the wall.

134
Part II: Postures for Health Maintenance and Restoration 
 
2. As you exhale, bend forward from the hips and hang your arms and 
head down.
 
 If your hands touch the floor, grasp your elbows with opposite-side 
hands and let your forearms hang. Keep your knees soft and relax your 
neck and head as illustrated in Figure 10-4.
 
Figure 10-4:

wall.
 
 
3. Stay in Step 2 for 2 to 3 minutes; use any of the Yoga breathing tech-
niques we cover in Chapter 5.
 
If you feel light-headed when doing this or any other inversion exercise, 
reduce the duration and increase the time gradually.
Trying a Trio of Shoulder Stands
These shoulder stands go from easiest to toughest. Each of these three 
shoulder stands provides common benefits: improved circulation to your 

135
 Chapter 10: Looking at the World Upside Down
legs, hips, back, neck, heart, and head. The postures all stimulate your endo-
crine glands and improve your lymphatic drainage, enhance elimination, 
and produce a calming and rejuvenating effect on your nervous system. The 
wall provides a useful prop for the easier two variations; when you’re ready, 
you can then advance with confidence to viparita karani, the half shoulder 
stand.
 
Due to the neck’s vulnerability, we recommend that you precede these pos-
tures with a dynamic (or moving) bridge posture (see Chapter 15) to prepare 
the neck and follow it with a short rest and then a dynamic cobra posture (see 
Chapter 11) to compensate.
 
Don’t attempt any of these postures if you’re pregnant; have high blood pres-
sure or a hiatal hernia; are overweight, even moderately so; have glaucoma, dia-
betic retinopathy, or neck problems; or are in the first few days of your period. 
Also, don’t use a mirrored wall, because you can injure yourself if you fall.
Half shoulder stand at the wall
This posture is a variation of viparita karani (see “Half shoulder stand: 
Viparita karani” later in this section) and is perhaps the easiest way to pick 
up the half shoulder stand in a step-by-step fashion. The wall provides sup-
port as you build experience with the shoulder stand exercises.
Here’s how you do it:
 
1. Lie on your back with your knees bent, your feet flat on the floor, 
your toes just touching the base of a sturdy wall, and your arms 
extended along the sides of your torso with your palms down.
 
2. Place your soles up on the wall so that your bent knees form a right 
angle (with your thighs parallel to each other and your shins perpen-
dicular to the wall) as in Figure 10-5a.
 
 You may need to slide your buttocks closer to or farther away from the 
wall to get the angle just right.
 
3. As you inhale, press down with your hands, push your feet to the 
wall, and lift your hips as high as you comfortably can as Figure 10-5b 
shows.
 
4. Bend your elbows and bring your hands to your lower back.
 
 Press your elbows and the backs of your upper arms on the floor for 
support. Relax your neck (see Figure 10-5c).

5. As you exhale, take one foot off the wall and extend that leg until 
you’re looking straight up at the tip of your big toe as illustrated in 
Figure 10-5d.
 
 You can use just one leg at a time and switch or raise both legs together. 
If you alternate legs, divide the time evenly between each leg.
 
6. Stay in Step 4 or 5 for as long as you feel comfortable or up to 5 min-
utes; use the Yoga breathing techniques we recommend in Chapter 5.
 
 When you want to come back down, slowly place one foot and then the 
other on the wall and finally lower your pelvis slowly to the floor.
Reverse half shoulder stand at the wall
The reverse half shoulder stand at the wall (see Figure 10-6b) is also a varia-
tion of viparita karani, which we discuss in “Half shoulder stand: Viparita 
karani” later in this chapter. Some people find this exercise easier than the 
half shoulder stand at the wall. Try them both and see which one is more 
comfortable for you.

137
 Chapter 10: Looking at the World Upside Down
To try this one, follow these steps:
 
1. Lie on your back with your head toward the wall at a full arms dis-
tance from the wall with your knees bent and your feet flat on the 
floor at hip width as in Figure 10-6a; bring your arms back and rest 
your arms along the sides of your body, palms down.
 
Figure 10-6: 
Another 
way to use 
the wall as a 
prop.

 Finding the correct distance from the wall can depend on the length of 
your arms. Try these three different measurements: touching the wall 
with your fingers extended; touching with the knuckles of your fists; and 
touching with the backs of your hands.
 
2. As you exhale, push your palms down, draw your bent knees in and 
up, and raise your hips to a comfortable angle of 45 to 75 degrees.
 
 Be sure that your legs are straight but your knees aren’t locked and that 
your feet are directly above your head.
 
3. Bend your elbows and bring your hands to the back of your pelvis 
and then slide your hands up to your lower back.
 
 Press your elbows and the backs of your upper arms on the floor for support.
 
4. Let your toes slowly and gently touch the wall for support; relax your 
neck (see Figure 10-6b).
 
5. Stay in Step 4 for as long as you feel comfortable, or up to 5 minutes.
 
6. When you want to come down, ease your hips to the floor with the support 
of your hands and then bend your knees and lower your feet to the floor.
Half shoulder stand: Viparita karani
You can work up to this posture by developing comfort with the half shoulder 
and reverse half shoulder stands at the wall (see the corresponding sections 

138
Part II: Postures for Health Maintenance and Restoration 
earlier in this chapter). It lets you enjoy the benefits of inversion without 
compressing your neck like a full shoulder stand does.
 
The Sanskrit word viparita (pronounced vee-pah-ree-tah) means “inverted, 
reversed” and karani (pronounced kah-rah-nee) means “action, process.” 
Some authorities call this practice sarvangasana, meaning “all limbs posture.” 
The word is composed of sarva (pronounced sahr-vah) and anga (pronounced 
ahn-gah) followed by asana.
When you feel you’re ready, follow these steps:
 
1. Lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet flat on the floor 
at hip width, resting your arms along the sides of your body with your 
palms down.
 
2. As you exhale, push your palms down, draw your bent knees in and 
up, and then straighten your legs as you raise your hips to a comfort-
able angle of 45 to 75 degrees (see Figure 10-7a).
 
Figure 10-7: 
The half 
shoulder 
stand.

3. Bend your elbows and bring your hands to the back of your pelvis 
and then slide your hands up to your lower back.
 
 Make sure your legs are straight but your knees aren’t locked and your 
feet are directly above your head. Press your elbows and the backs of 
your upper arms on the floor for support. Relax your neck. Figure 11-7b 
shows you this portion of the posture.
 
4. Stay in Step 3 for as long as you feel comfortable, or up to 5 minutes.
 
5. When you want to come down, first ease your hips to the floor with 
the support of your hands and then bend your knees and lower your 
feet to the floor.

Chapter 11
Easy ’round the Bends
In This Chapter
▶ Respecting your spine
▶ Introducing six back bends
▶ Checking out three side bends
▶ Venturing into four forward bends
T
his chapter presents a variety of yogic bends. Think of them as simple 
extensions of the breath. Inhalation takes you naturally into a back bend, 
exhalation into a forward bend (for more on breath and movement, flip to 
Chapter 5). You can perform bending postures from many different positions — 
standing, kneeling, sitting, lying, or even turned upside-down (see Chapter 10). 
Because we cover the upright bending postures in Chapter 7 and the most 
popular bends for warm-up in Chapter 6, this chapter highlights the classic 
bending postures that you do on the floor.
Gaining a Strong Backbone 
 (And Some Insight)
Without the spinal column, you’d never experience back pain — but then 
again, you couldn’t walk upright either! The backbone enables you to bend 
forward, backward, and sideways, and it also allows you to twist. You per-
form all these motions every day, but you may do them unconsciously and 
without adequate muscular support. Yoga uses the natural movements of 
the spine to train the various muscles supporting it, which contributes to a 
healthy back and prevent back pain.
Although the spinal column’s elegant curvature is well-designed for the 
upright position, people aren’t always very clever about using it correctly. 
The 33 vertebrae, or backbones (24 of which comprise the flexible part of the 
spine), are held in place by a series of powerful muscles and ligaments that 
require regular exercise to maintain top working order.

140
Part II: Postures for Health Maintenance and Restoration 
Numerous muscles, arranged in several layers in the front, back, neck, and 
perineum (the area between the anus and the genitals), maintain the spine in 
position. When they become weak or damaged from inadequate or improper 
use or injury, any one of these can pull the spine out of alignment, leading 
to discomfort, pain, and inadequate nerve communication to the organs and 
other parts of the body, which may lead to further complications.
The spinal column is so important because it protects the spinal cord — a 
bundle of nerves that runs through the bony tower, your backbone. The 
nerves feed the trunk and limbs with information from the brain, and the 
brain returns the favor. If the nerve connection is severed at any point, you 
lose conscious control of the affected part of your body.
 
The spine also has psychological significance. A person of integrity and 
strength of character is said to “have backbone” and a coward is said to 
be “spineless.” Because people believe that outside presentation reflects 
inside influences, they tend to judge a person’s mental state from his bodily 
demeanor. If you’re chronically hunched over, you signal to others that you’re 
also inwardly collapsed. On the other hand, if you stand straight and tall, you 
give others the impression of self-assuredness, energy, and courage.
 
From a yogic point of view, the spine is the physical aspect of a subtle energetic 
pathway that runs from its base to the crown of the head. This pathway is 
known as the central channel or sushumna-nadi (“gracious conduit,” pronounced 
soo-shoom-nah nah-dee). In traditional Hatha Yoga and Tantra Yoga, the awak-
ened “serpent power,” or kundalini-shakti, rises through this channel. When this 
power of pure consciousness reaches the crown of the head, you experience a 
sublime state of ecstasy. We say more about the central channel in Chapter 21.
Bending Over Backwards
Daily life entails a lot of forward bending: putting on a pair of pants; tying 
shoelaces; picking things up from the floor; working at your computer; gar-
dening; playing sports, and so on. A forward bend closes the front of the 
torso, shortens the front of the spine, and rounds the back. This closing and 
The spine as the axis of your world
According to Yoga symbolism, the spine cor-
responds to the axis of the universe, which is 
pictured as a gigantic golden mountain called 
Mount Meru. At the top of this mountain (that 
is, in your head) resides heaven, where all the 
deities are seated.

141
 Chapter 11: Easy ’round the Bends
rounding is exaggerated by the unhealthy habit of bending forward from the 
waist rather than from the hip joints. Bending forward in the wrong way day 
in and day out can lead to spinal problems.
To experience the difference between bending from the hips and bending 
from the waist, sit upright in a chair with your feet flat on the floor and place 
your hands on the outside of your hip bones with the fingers turned inward. 
As you inhale, move your spine upward, lift your chest and look straight 
ahead. As you exhale, keep your chest lifted and bend forward: You’re bend-
ing forward from the hips. Now, sit in the chair and move your hands up a 
few inches until they’re just under your rib cage. As you exhale, bring your 
chin to your chest and your head down toward your thighs, bowing your 
spine. This bend is from the waist. Over the years, this waist-bending habit 
leads to what is often called a stoop, characterized by a sunken chest, for-
ward-leaning head, aches and pains, and shallow breathing.
The antidote for the cumulative effects of forward bending is the regular 
practice of Yoga back bends, which stretch the front of the torso (and spine). 
Take a deep inhalation right now and notice how your torso (and spine) natu-
rally extends during this active, opening phase of the breathing cycle, inviting 
you to bend backwards. Back bends are expansive, extroverted postures that 
can trigger powerful emotions. The major back bends usually come toward 
the middle of a Yoga routine so that you have plenty of time to prepare for 
these movements and to compensate afterwards (see Chapter 15 for more on 
preparation and compensation). In this section, we present some of the clas-
sic floor back bends.
 
To make these cobra and locust postures easier, place a small pillow or a 
folded blanket underneath you between your abdomen and your chest. You 
can move the blanket a little forward or backward to suit your needs (see 
Figure 11-4b later in the chapter for an illustration).
 
When you lie face down on the floor and raise your chest and head and use 
your arms in some fashion, you’re doing some form of the cobra posture. 
When you raise just your legs, or a combination of your legs, chest, and arms, 
you’re performing some form of the locust posture.
 
Move slowly and cautiously in all of the cobra and locust postures. Avoid any 
of the postures that cause pain in your lower back, upper back, or neck.
Cobra I
The cobra posture increases the flexibility and strength of the muscles of the 
arms, chest, shoulders, and back. Cobra I especially emphasizes the upper 
back. The cobra opens the chest, increases lung capacity, and stimulates the 
kidneys and the adrenals.

142
Part II: Postures for Health Maintenance and Restoration 
This first cobra posture is also called The Sphinx. It’s a variation of of bhu-
jangasana, which we describe in the next section. To do this first version of 
cobra, follow these steps:
 
1. Lie on your abdomen with your legs spread at hip width and the tops 
of your feet on the floor.
 
2. Rest your forehead on the floor and relax your shoulders; bend your 
elbows and place your forearms on the floor with your palms turned 
down and positioned near the sides of your head (see Figure 11-1a).
 
Figure 11-1: 
Cobra I

the upper 
back and is 
easier than 
cobra II.
 
a
b
 
3. As you inhale, engage your back muscles, press your forearms against 
the floor, and raise your chest and head.
 
 Look straight ahead, as shown in Figure 11-1b. Keep your forearms and the 
front of your pelvis on the floor, being mindful of relaxing your shoulders.
 
4. As you exhale, lower your torso and head slowly back to the floor.
 
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 three times and then stay in Step 3 (the last 
raised position) for 6 to 8 breaths.
 
If you have lower back problems, separate your legs wider than your hips and 
let your heels turn out and your toes turn in.
Cobra II: Bhujangasana
This posture rewards you with most of the same benefits as cobra I, which 
we describe in the preceding section. In addition, cobra II emphasizes flexibil-
ity in your lower back.
The following steps walk you through cobra II:
 
1. Lie on your abdomen with your legs spread at hip width and the tops 
of your feet on the floor.

143
 Chapter 11: Easy ’round the Bends
 
2. Bend your elbows and place your palms on the floor with your 
thumbs near your armpits.
 
 Rest your forehead on the floor and relax your shoulders, as shown in 
Figure 11-2a.
 
Figure 11-2:

3. As you inhale, press your palms against the floor, engage your back 
muscles, and raise your chest and head.
 
 Look straight ahead (see Figure 11-2b). Keep the top front of your pelvis 
on the floor and your shoulders relaxed. Unless you’re very flexible, 
keep your elbows slightly bent.
 
4. As you exhale, lower your torso and head slowly back to the floor.
 
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 three times and then stay in Step 3 (the last 
raised position) for 6 to 8 breaths.
Note: In the classic (traditionally taught) posture, the inner legs are joined 
and the knees are straight. The head is in alignment with the spine and the 
eyes look forward. The palms are on the floor close to the sides of the torso 
near the navel, the elbows are slightly bent and the shoulders relaxed.
 
If you move your hands farther forward, the cobra is less difficult; if you move 
your hands farther back you increase the difficulty.
 
The Sanskrit word bhujangasana is composed of bhujanga (pronounced bhooj-
ahng-gah), meaning “serpent,” and asana, or “posture.”
Cobra III
Cobra III, which is another version of the classic bhujangasana, is unique 
because it doesn’t ask you to place your hands on the floor. The emphasis is 
on strengthening both the lower and upper back.

144
Part II: Postures for Health Maintenance and Restoration 
Try out cobra III by following these steps:
 
1. Lie on your abdomen with your legs spread at hip width and the tops 
of your feet on the floor; rest your forehead on the floor.
 
2. Extend your arms back along the sides of your torso with your palms 
on the floor as Figure 11-3a illustrates.

wings out to the sides and then all the way forward.
 
 Keep your legs on the floor, as shown in Figure 11-3b.
 
4. As you exhale, sweep your arms back and lower your torso and your 
head slowly to the floor.
 
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 three times and then stay in Step 3 (the last 
raised position) for 6 to 8 breaths.
Locust I: Shalabhasana
The locust posture strengthens the entire torso including the lower back and 
the neck. In addition, it strengthens the buttocks and the legs and improves 
digestion and elimination.
To clench or not to clench: That is the question
An ongoing controversy in the Yoga world 
is “Should the buttocks be firm or soft in the 
cobra?” The traditional instruction is to firm the 
buttocks. However, the work of New Zealand-
born physiotherapist Robin McKenzie has revo-
lutionized back care — and ideas about back 
bends. In his own version of the cobra, called 
The McKenzie Technique, McKenzie suggests 
that the buttocks be soft to facilitate the heal-
ing of numerous lower back ailments. Try the 
cobra both ways, with the buttocks firm or soft, 
and see which feels best to you. Note: This dis-
cussion applies to cobra only; in all the locust 
postures, the buttocks are usually tight.

145
 Chapter 11: Easy ’round the Bends
To try this first locust posture, follow these steps:
 
1. Lie on your abdomen with your legs spread at hip width and the tops 
of your feet on the floor; rest your forehead on the floor.
 
2. Extend your arms along the sides of your torso with your palms on the 
floor.
 
3. As you inhale, raise your chest, head, and one leg up and away from 
the floor as high as is comfortable for you (see Figure 11-4a).
 
Figure 11-4:

chest, head, 
and leg on 
an inhale,

 Consider trying this posture with blankets for more personal comfort. 
Figure 11-4b shows you the basic blanket positioning, though you can 
shift it as necessary.
 
4. As you exhale, lower your chest, head, and leg together slowly to the 
floor and repeat Steps 3 and 4 with the other leg.
 
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 three times and then stay in Step 3 (the last 
raised position) for 6 to 8 breaths.
 
You can increase the level of difficulty by raising both legs at the same time in 
Step 3.
Note: In the classic posture, the inner legs are joined, the knees are straight.
Locust II
This posture, which is another variation of shalabhasana, also teaches the 
two sides of the body how to work independently of one another. Many back 
problems are due to imbalances in the muscle system on each side of the 
spine. Health professionals often call this situation an asymmetrical problem. 
Locust II helps bring your back into symmetry again and also improves your 
coordination.

146
Part II: Postures for Health Maintenance and Restoration 
The following steps get you on the road to enjoying these benefits:
 
1. Lie on your abdomen with your legs spread at hip width and the tops 
of your feet on the floor; rest your forehead on the floor.
 
2. Extend your right arm forward with your palm resting on the floor; 
bring your left arm back along the left side of your torso, with the 
back of your hand on the floor as shown in Figure 11-5a.
 
Figure 11-5: 
This posture 
balances the 
muscles on 
each side of 
your back.
 
a
b
 
3. As you inhale, slowly raise your chest, head, right arm, and left leg up 
and away from the floor as high as is comfortable for you.
 
 Try to keep the upper right arm and ear in alignment, and raise your left 
foot and right hand to the same height above the floor (see Figure 11-5b).
 
4. As you exhale, lower your right arm, chest, head, and left leg slowly 
to the floor at the same time.
 
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 three times and then stay in Step 3 for 6 to 8 
breaths.
 
6. Repeat Steps 1 through 5 with opposite pairs (left arm and right leg).
 
Locust II features some interesting biomechanics. When you raise the chest 
and the right arm, you strengthen the right side of your upper back. When you 
raise the left leg, you strengthen the right side of your lower back. So even 
though this posture uses opposite arms and legs, it strengthens one side of 
the upper and lower back at a time.
 
Avoid locust variations that lift just the legs. Lifting the legs alone increases 
interabdominal and chest pressure, heart rate, and tension in the neck.
Locust III: Superman posture
This posture, a further variation of shalabhasana, gets its name from the image 
of Superman flying through the air at warp speed, with his arms extended 
out in front leading the way. It’s the most strenuous back bend because fully 

147
 Chapter 11: Easy ’round the Bends
extending your arms and legs as shown in Figure 11-6 puts quite a load on your 
entire back. Use this pose only after you’re comfortable with locust I and II.
 
This posture is physically challenging. Don’t attempt it if you’re having back 
or neck problems.
If you’re ready and able, try the following steps:
 
1. Lie on your abdomen with your legs spread at hip width and the tops 
of your feet on the floor; extend your arms back along the sides of 
your torso with your palms on the floor and rest your forehead on the 
floor (see Figure 11-6a).

2. As you inhale, raise your chest, legs, and head and sweep your arms 
like wings out to the sides and then all the way forward as 
Figure 11-6b illustrates.
 
 In the beginning, try sweeping your arms only halfway forward in a T 
position; it allows your back muscles to gradually become accustomed 
to the posture’s physical demands.
 
3. As you exhale, sweep your arms back and lower your torso, legs, and 
head slowly to the floor at the same time.
 
4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 three times and then stay in Step 2 (the last 
raised position) for 6 to 8 breaths.
Bending from Side to Side
The spinal column can move in four basic ways: forward (flexion), backward 
(extension), sideways (lateral flexion), and twist (rotation). The side bend 
is often the least practiced in Yoga. This missed opportunity is unfortunate 
because side bends help to stretch and tone the muscles along the sides of 
the abdomen, rib cage, and spine, keeping your waist trim, your breathing 
full, and your spine supple.

148
Part II: Postures for Health Maintenance and Restoration 
A true side bend fully contracts one side of the body while expanding the other. 
To experience the effects of a side bend right now, simply lean over to your right 
(or left) side as you exhale and reach the same-side arm downward. To realize 
the full effect of the stretch, reach the opposite-side arm up toward the ceiling. In 
this section, we cover some safe, creative ways to use side bends on the floor.
Seated side bend
This seated side bend is a great way to ease into the position if you’re not 
used to bending from side to side. Just follow these steps:
 
1. Sit comfortably in a simple cross-legged position.
 
 Place your right palm on the floor, near your right hip. Check out 
Chapter 6 for some appropriate seated positions.
 
2. As you inhale, raise your left arm out to the side and up above your 
head beside your left ear.
 
3. As you exhale, slide your right hand across the floor out to the right, 
letting your torso, head, and left arm follow as you bend to the right 
as Figure 11-7 shows.
 
 Don’t let your buttocks come off the floor as you bend.

 Chapter 11: Easy ’round the Bends
 
4. As you inhale, return to the upright position (as you were at the start 
of Step 2).
 
5. Repeat Steps 2 through 4 three times and then stay in the bent posi-
tion (Step 3) for 6 to 8 breaths.
 
6. Repeat Steps 1 through 5 on the other side.
All-fours side bend
Many people with back or hip problems have a hard time sitting upright on 
the floor. The all-fours position gives the spine more freedom and is an easier 
side bend from the floor. Follow these steps to enjoy the benefits:
 
1. Start on your hands and knees, with your knees below your hips and 
your hands below your shoulders with your palms on the floor.
 
 Straighten your elbows, but don’t lock them. Look straight ahead.
 
2. As you exhale, bend your head and torso sideways to the right and 
look toward your tailbone (see Figure 11-8).
 
3. As you inhale, return to the starting position in Step 1.
 
4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 three times and then stay in Step 2 for 6 to 8 
breaths.
 
5. Repeat Steps 2 through 4 on the other side.

Folded side bend
The Sanskrit word bala (pronounced bah-lah) means “child.” This practice 
was inspired by a baby’s folded position in the womb. The benefits of this 
side bend, which is a variation of balasana, the child’s posture (covered in 
Chapter 15), are the same as for the seated side bend.
The following steps show you how it works:
 
1. Sit on your heels with your toes pointing back and fold forward by 
laying your abdomen on your thighs and your head on the floor.
 
 Extend your arms forward with yourpalms on the floor as in 
Figure 11-9a
 
Figure 11-9: 
Wait a few 
moments 
before you 
stretch 
farther on 
each side.
 
a
b
 
2. As you exhale, stay in the folded position and slide your upper torso, 
head, arms, and hands to the right as far as possible, as shown in 
Figure 11-9b.
 
 Wait for a few seconds and again, with another exhalation, slide farther 
to the right if you can do so without straining.
 
3. Return to center and repeat the sequence to the left side, staying in 
Step 2 for 6 to 8 breaths on each side.
Bending Forward
Of all the ways the human torso (and spine) can move, bending forward is 
the maneuver folks most commonly use. A tucked or fetal position is inher-
ently comforting to most people, perhaps because they spend their first nine 
months positioned like that in their mothers’ wombs.

151
 Chapter 11: Easy ’round the Bends
Forward bends are usually a good way to begin any movement routine 
(unless you’re dealing with spinal disc injuries or certain other back 
problems). Though back bends are the lively extroverts of the asana family, 
forward bends are the retiring introverts; they’re always performed with an 
exhalation — the passive, contracting phase of the breathing cycle.
Constantly bending forward from the waist tends to put stress on the lower 
back and neck. Yogic forward bends call for movement from the hip joints, a 
switch that can help you maintain a healthy, stress-free spine as you correct 
the poor forward-bending habits we discuss earlier in this chapter.
 
Be very careful of all the seated forward bends if you have disc-related back 
problems.
 
If you have a problem sitting upright on the floor in the seated forward bend 
or in any of the following forward bending postures, raise your hips with 
folded blankets or firm pillows, as shown in Figure 11-10c.
Seated forward bend: Pashcimottanasana
The seated forward bend intensely stretches the entire back side of the body, 
including the back of the spine and legs. It also tones the muscles and organs 
of the abdomen and creates a calming and quieting effect.
To enjoy these benefits, try the following:
 
1. Sit on the floor with your legs at hip width and comfortably stretched 
out in front of you.
 
 Bring your back up nice and tall and place your palms down on the floor 
near your thighs.
 
2. As you inhale, raise your arms forward and up overhead until they’re 
beside your ears as shown in Figure 11-10a.
 
 Keep your arms and legs soft and slightly bent in Forgiving Limbs, which 
we describe in Chapter 3.
 
3. As you exhale, bend forward from the hips; bring your hands, chest, 
and head toward your legs.
 
 Rest your hands on the floor, your thighs, knees, shins, or feet. If your 
head isn’t close to your knees, bend your knees more until you feel your 
back stretching (see Figure 11-10b).
 
4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 three times and then stay folded (Step 3) for 6 
to 8 breaths.

Note: In the classic posture, the inner legs are joined, the knees are straight, 
and the ankles are extended so that the toes point up). The chin rests on the 
chest, the hands hold the sides of the feet, the back is extended forward, and 
the forehead is pressed against the legs.
 
In Sanskrit, pashcimottanasana (pronounced pash-chee-moh-tah-nah-sah-nah) 
translates to the “extension of the West posture.” In yogic jargon, the West refers 
to the back, and the East stands for the front. The symbolism refers to both the 
physical and psychological effects of this posture: It stretches the back of the 
body, especially the back of the spine and legs, and just as the sun sets in the 
West, the “light” of your consciousness draws inward as you fold upon yourself.
Head-to-knee posture: Janushirshasana
The head-to-knee posture keeps your spine supple, stimulates the abdominal 
organs, and stretches your back, especially on the side of the extended leg. It 
also activates the central channel (sushumna-nadi). As we explain in Chapter 5, 
the central channel is the pathway for the awakened energy of pure conscious-
ness (called kundalini-shakti), which leads to ecstasy and spiritual liberation.

153
 Chapter 11: Easy ’round the Bends
Follow these steps to achieve this posture:
 
1. Sit on the floor with your legs stretched out in front of you and then 
bend your left knee and bring your left heel toward your right groin.
 
2. Rest your bent left knee on the floor (but don’t force it down) and 
place the sole of your left foot on the inside of your right thigh.
 
 The toes of the left foot point toward the right knee.
 
3. Bring your back up nice and tall; as you inhale, raise your arms forward 
and up overhead until they’re beside your ears as Figure 11-11a shows.
 
 Keep your arms and the right leg soft and slightly bent in Forgiving 
Limbs, which we describe in Chapter 3.

4. As you exhale, bend forward from the hips, bringing your hands, 
chest and head toward your right leg.
 
 Rest your hands on the floor or your thigh, knee, shin, or foot. If your 
head isn’t close to your right knee, bend your knee more until you feel 
your back stretching on the right side (see Figure 11-11b).
 
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 three times and then stay in Step 4 (the final for-
ward bend) for 6 to 8 breaths.
 
6. Repeat Steps 1 through 4 on the opposite side.
 
Keep your back muscles as relaxed as possible.

Part II: Postures for Health Maintenance and Restoration 
 
The Sanskrit word janu (pronounced jah-noo) means “knee,” and shirsha (pro-
nounced sheer-shah) means “head.”
Volcano: Mahamudra
Ancient Hatha Yoga texts give high praise to the volcano posture. It strength-
ens the back, stretches the legs, and opens the hips and chest. This posture 
is unique in that has qualities of both a forward bend and a back bend. When 
used with special locks (bandhas) that contain and channel energy in the 
torso, this technique has both cleansing and healing effects.
Here’s how to do it:
 
1. Sitting on the floor with your legs stretched out in front of you, bend 
your left knee and bring your left foot toward your right groin.
 
2. Rest your bent left knee on the floor to the left (but don’t force it 
down), and place the sole of your left foot on the inside of your right 
thigh with your heel in your groin.
 
 The toes of left foot point toward the right knee.
 
3. Bring your back up nice and tall; as you inhale, raise your arms for-
ward and up overhead until they’re beside your ears.
 
 Keep your arms and the right leg soft and slightly bent in Forgiving 
Limbs, as we describe in Chapter 3. Refer to Figure 11-11a in the preced-
ing section if necessary.
 
4. As you exhale, bend forward from the hips, lift your chest forward, 
and extend your back without letting it round.
 
 Place your hands on the right knee, shin, or toes and look straight ahead 
(see Figure 11-12).
 
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 three times and then stay in Step 4 for 6 to 8 
breaths.
 
6. Repeat the same sequence on the opposite side.
Note: In the classic posture, the front leg and the arms are straight, and the 
hands are holding the toes of the front leg. The back is extended and the 
chin is pressed on the chest. The abdominal muscles are pulled up into the 
abdominal cavity and the anal sphincter is tightened.
 
The Sanskrit term mahamudra (pronounced mah-hah-mood-rah) means lit-
erally “great seal.” Here it applies to a Yoga posture, but in other contexts, 
mahamudra is a mental exercise that allows your mind to flow out into the 
open sky. Try combining this inner “attitude” with the physical pose.

Spread-legged forward bend: 
Upavishta konasana
The spread-legged forward bend stretches the backs and insides of the legs 
(hamstrings and adductors) and increases the flexibility of the spine and hip 
joints. It improves circulation to the entire pelvic region, tones the abdomen, 
and has a calming effect on the nervous system. Note, though, that muscle 
density may make this posture difficult for most men. If you want to give it a 
try, check out the following steps:
 
1. Sit on the floor, with your legs straight and spread wide apart (but not 
more than 90 degrees).
 
 Because this posture is challenging, give yourself an advantage by pull-
ing the flesh of the buttocks (you may know them as “cheeks”) out 
from under the sits bones (the bones directly under that flesh; they’re 
also known as the ischial tuberosities) and bending your knees slightly. 
Alternatively, sit on some folded blankets.

156
Part II: Postures for Health Maintenance and Restoration 
 
2. As you inhale, raise your arms forward and up overhead until they’re 
beside your ears.
 
 Keep your elbows soft and your legs slightly bent in Forgiving Limbs, 
as we describe in Chapter 3. Bring your back up nice and tall (see 
Figure 11-13a).

3. As you exhale, bend forward from the hips and bring your hands, 
chest, and head toward the floor.
 
 Rest your extended arms and hands palms down on the floor. If you 
have the flexibility, place your forehead on the floor as well as shown in 
Figure 11-13b.
 
4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 three times and then stay in Step 3 (the folded 
position) for 6 to 8 breaths.
Note: In the classic posture, the legs are straight with the toes vertical, the 
chin and chest are on the floor, and the arms are extended forward with the 
palms joined.
 
The spread-legged forward bend is also called the lifetime posture because it 
can take a whole lifetime to master. But don’t worry if you don’t quite reach 
mastery. According to Yoga’s outlook, if you don’t master the pose in this life-
time, you can try again in the next lifetime.
 
The Sanskrit term upavishta (pronounced oopah-vish-tah) means “seated” and 
kona (pronounced koh-nah) means “angle.”

Several Twists on the Yoga Twist
In This Chapter
▶ Enjoying spinal fitness — with a yogic twist
▶ Introducing six simple twists
I
magine you’re cleaning up the kitchen with a wet sponge. After mopping 
up some spills the sponge gets dirty. You hold it under the kitchen faucet, 
turn on the water, and squeeze out the dirty water. As you release the pres-
sure on the sponge, it sucks up some clean water. You’re ready to start again.
This sponge analogy helps to visualize how yogic twists work on the spine. 
The pulpy pads between the individual bones, called the intervertebral discs 
have no direct blood supply of their own after about age 20, so they depend 
on your everyday movements to help them wring out the accumulated 
wastes and, in turn, soak up a fresh supply of blood and other reviving fluids. 
This process is called imbibation. Over time, if your discs aren’t continually 
squeezed and soaked, they tend to harden and dry out, like a sponge left 
unused for a few days. Consequently, your spine stiffens up and shrinks.
Twists are an important component of any Yoga practice. They clean out the 
discs and help keep them firm and supple; massage the internal organs, such 
as your intestines and kidneys; stoke the inner fire of digestion; and stretch 
and strengthen the muscles of your back and abdomen.
This chapter features seated twists, which emphasize the upper spine, and 
reclining twists, which emphasize the lower spine. For standing twists, see 
Chapter 8.
 
Approach all twists with caution if you’re suffering from disc problems any-
where in your spine. Consult your physician, chiropractor, or physical thera-
pist or work with a reputable Yoga therapist after you have a diagnosis.

Trying Simple Upright Twists
When thinking about the human body and mind, people often associate the 
word twist with pain or something undesirable. For example, people say 
things like, “She twisted her ankle,” “He has a twisted mind,” or “She accused 
him of twisting her words.” But twisting isn’t all bad. Ropes get their strength 
from the twisted strands that comprise them. Yogic twisting postures have 
the same positive effect. When done properly, they bring strength to your 
body, especially to the weak spots (notably the lower back). True enough, 
twisting is part of your everyday movements. But unless your muscles are 
well trained, you can easily injure yourself. The exercises in this section can 
help you get your back in tip-top shape as you look forward to enjoyment and 
enlightenment along the way.
Easy chair twist
This seated posture is an excellent way for a beginner to achieve a good twist 
safely before moving on to more complex methods of twisting. And, you can 
use this simple, effective posture to liberate your spine while at the office 
without drawing too much attention to yourself. Your spine will thank you!
 
Twist mainly from your shoulders; the head and neck come along for the ride.
 
1. Sit sideways on a chair with the chair back to your left, your feet flat 
on the floor, and your heels directly below your knees.
 
2. Exhale, turn to the left, and hold the sides of the chair back with your 
hands.
 
3. As you inhale, extend or lift your spine upward.
 
4. As you exhale, twist your torso and head farther to the left as in 
Figure 12-1.
 
5. Repeat Steps 1 through 4, gradually twisting farther with each exhala-
tion, for 3 breaths (don’t force it) and then hold the twist for 6 to 8 
breaths.
 
6. Repeat Steps 1 through 5 on the opposite side.
 
If your feet aren’t comfortably on the floor for the easy chair twist, elevate 
them with a folded blanket or a phone book.

Easy sitting twist
After you can twist comfortably while seated on a chair (see the preceding sec-
tion), you can transfer your newly gained skill to the floor and try the following 
exercise. Its effect is similar to that of the easy chair twist, and it fits nicely into 
a regular Yoga practice, a large part of which may be done on the floor.
 
1. Sit on the floor with your legs in a simple cross-legged position and 
extend your spine upward, nice and tall.
 
2. Place your left hand palm down on top of your right knee.
 
3. Place your right hand palm down on the floor behind your right hip 
to prop yourself up.
 
4. As you inhale, extend your spine upward.
 
5. As you exhale, twist your torso and head to the right (see Figure 12-2).

6. Repeat Steps 4 and 5 for 3 breaths, gradually twisting farther with 
each exhalation (don’t force it), and then hold the twist for 6 to 8 
breaths.
 
7. Repeat Steps 1 through 6 on the opposite side.
 
If you have difficulty sitting upright in this seated twist, use blankets or pillows 
to make your hips even with your knees.
The sage twist
The easy chair twist and the easy sitting twist we cover in the preceding sec-
tions are the simplest yogic twists. By changing the position of your legs, you 
can alter the level of difficulty and also enhance the overall benefit. The sage 
twist does just that to give you extra rewards for your investment.
 
1. Sit on the floor with both legs extended forward; bend your right knee 
and place your right foot on the floor just inside your left thigh, with 
your toes facing forward.
 
2. Place your right hand, palm down, on the floor behind you; wrap the 
palm of your left hand around the side of your right knee.

161

for 3 breaths (don’t force it) and then hold the twist for 6 to 8 breaths.
 
6. Repeat Steps 1 through 5 on the opposite side.
 
If you have difficulty sitting upright in this seated twist, sit on blankets or pil-
lows until your hips are even with your knees.
 
This posture is a variation of the classic posture called maricyasana. The 
Sanskrit word marici (pronounced mah-ree-chee) means “ray of light” and is 
the name of an ancient sage.
Twisting While Reclining
The twists in the preceding section all require you to sit upright, but the 
remaining exercises in this chapter call for you to lie down — with a (literal) 
twist. In the twists described in this section, you harvest all kinds of benefits, 
including a delicious feeling of release in your spine.

162
Part II: Postures for Health Maintenance and Restoration 
Bent leg supine twist
The bent supine twist is a variation of the classic posture known as parivar-
tanasana. The Sanskrit word parivartana (pronounced pah-ree-vahr-tah-nah) 
means “turning.”
This posture has a calming effect on the lower back. Here’s how you do it:
 
1. Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet on the floor at hip 
width and extend your arms out from your sides like a T (in line with 
the top of your shoulders) with your palms down.
 
2. As you exhale, slowly lower your bent legs to the right side while 
turning your head to the left (see Figure 12-4).
 
 Keep your head on the floor.
 
Figure 12-4:

4. As you exhale, slowly lower your bent knees to the left while turning 
your head to the right.
 
5. Repeat Steps 1 through 4, alternating three times slowly on each side, 
and then hold one last twist on each side for 6 to 8 breaths.

 Chapter 12: Several Twists on the Yoga Twist
The Swiss army knife
This posture, a variation of the classic jathara parivritti, tones the abdominal 
organs and intestines and stretches the lower back and hips. Jathara parivritti 
(pronounced jat-hah-rah pah-ree-vree-tee) means “belly twisting.” Just follow 
these steps:
 
1. Lie flat on the floor with your legs straight down and extend your 
arms out from your sides like a T (in line with the top of your shoul-
ders) with your palms up.
 
2. Bend your right knee and draw your thigh into your abdomen.
 
3. As you exhale, slowly lower your bent right leg to the left side and 
extend it out a comfortable distance.
 
4. Extend your left arm on the floor along the left side of your head (palm 
up), and then turn your head to the right as shown in Figure 12-5.
 
 Keep your head on the floor and try to visualize lines of energy going out 
through your arms and legs.
 
5. Follow Steps 1 through 4 and then relax and stay in Step 4 for 6 to 8 
breaths.
 
6. Repeat Steps 1 through 5 on the opposite side.

Extended legs supine twist: 
Jathara parivritti
If you enjoy practicing the Swiss army knife (see the preceding section), 
you’re likely to enjoy this slightly more demanding exercise. This variation 
of jathara parivritti gives you the same benefits as the Swiss army knife but 
creates an even more pronounced stretch of the lower back and hips. And, 
of course, stretching is good for your muscles and your spine. The following 
steps show you how it works:
 
1. Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet on the floor at hip 
width and extend your arms out from your sides like a T in line with 
the top of your shoulders with palms down.
 
2. Bend your knees and draw both your thighs into your abdomen.
 
3. As you exhale, slowly lower your bent legs to the right side.
 
4. Extend both legs out a comfortable distance and then turn your head 
to the left as Figure 12-6 illustrates.
 
 Keep your head on the floor. If this posture is difficult, try bending both 
legs a little more.

Note: In the classic (traditionally taught) version of this posture, the knees 
are straight and the joined legs are resting on the floor. The arms are straight 
and extended to the sides at right angles to the torso. The hand on the same 
side of the extended legs holds the top foot.

Dynamic Posture: The 
Rejuvenation Sequence 
and Sun Salutation
In This Chapter
▶ Trying the 7-step sun salutation
▶ Experiencing the 12-step sun salutation
T
he sun has long captured humanity’s attention for its life-giving power. 
Sun worship is one of humankind’s first and most natural forms of spiri-
tual expression: Just think of the Sumerians, Egyptians, and Mayans. But 
nowhere has this homage to the solar spirit been as well preserved as in 
India’s 10,000-year-old civilization, where to this day millions of people pay 
respects to the sun as a part of their daily rituals.
You don’t have to be a sun worshiper, though, to benefit from Yoga’s sun 
salutation (surya namaskara, pronounced soor-yah nah-mahs-kah-rah). This 
exercise — a special sequence of postures — is considered so profound 
many people use it on its own.
 
The sun salutation helps you remember the Yogic idea that your body is con-
densed sunlight. The saluting gesture, called namaskara mudra in Sanskrit 
(pronounced nah-mahs-kah-rah mood-rah), is a salute to the highest aspect 
within yourself — the spirit.
The actual technique for and number of steps in the sun salutation vary 
somewhat among the different Yoga schools and organizations. Of course, 
each school claims to practice the original sun salutation. In this chapter, we 
focus on the best-known form of sun salutation — a 12-step sequence intro-
duced to America in the early 1950s by the late Swami Vishnu Devananda, 
a disciple of the great Swami Shivananda of Rishikesh, India. First, though, 
we introduce a modified 7-step version you do from a kneeling position; it’s 
ideally suited for those who have yet to develop enough flexibility, muscle 
strength, and fitness for the 12-step version.

Warming up for the Sun: Rejuvenating 
in 9 Steps
Do you need a more user-friendly version of the sun salutation? Do you have a 
hard time kneeling (as required in the 7-step sun salutation later in this chap-
ter) or stepping through (as required in the 12-step sun salutation later in this 
chapter)? Then try the 9-step rejuvenation sequence direct from California, 
using the focus breathing technique from Chapter 5:
 
1. Stand in the mountain posture with your feet at hip width and arms at 
your sides (see Figure 13-1a).
 
2. As you inhale, slowly raise your arms out from the sides and up over-
head (see Figure 13-1b) and then pause.
 
3. As you exhale, bend forward from the waist and bring your head 
toward your knees and your hands forward and down toward the 
floor in the standing forward bend (see Figure 13-1c).
 
 Keep your arms and legs soft (see Chapter 3 for an explanation of 
Forgiving Limbs). Then pause.
 
4. Bend your knees quite a bit and as you inhale, sweep your arms out 
from the sides, but only come halfway up with your arms in a T (half 
forward bend), as shown in Figure 13-1d.
 
 Then pause briefly.
 
5. As you exhale, fold all the way down again and hang your arms in the 
standing forward bend (see Figure 13-1e).
 
6. As you inhale, sweep your arms from the sides like wings and bring 
your torso all the way up again, standing with your arms overhead in 
the standing arm raise (see Figure 13-1f).
 
7. As you exhale, bend your knees and squat halfway to the floor.
 
 Soften your arms but keep them overhead; look straight ahead (see

No one knows how old the sun salutation is, but 
at the beginning of the 20th century, the Raja of 
Oudh, representing a small state in Northern India, 
encouraged all his subjects to learn and practice 
this exercise sequence. He personally practiced 
the sun salutation for health and happiness.

8. As you inhale, bring your torso all the way up again, standing with 
your arms overhead in the standing arm raise (see Figure 13-1h).
 
9. As you exhale, bring your arms back to your sides as in Step 1 (see 
Figure 13-1i).
Repeat the entire sequence 6 to 8 times slowly.
 
To make it harder on the last round, stay for 6 to 8 breaths in the half forward 
bend (Step 4), the standing forward bend (Step 5), and the half squat or half 
chair (Step 8).
To make it much harder, do the entire sequence standing on your toes.
Gliding Through the 7-Step 
Kneeling Salutation
If you aren’t quite ready to tackle the 12-step sun salutation, the following 
7-step variation can give you many benefits and also help you get in shape 
for the standing variety. Use focus, chest-to-belly, or belly-to-chest breathing 
techniques from Chapter 5 and follow these steps.
 
Just follow your breath — inhale when you’re opening, exhale when you’re 
folding. Move slowly, pausing after each inhalation and exhalation.
 
1. Sit on your heels in a bent-knee position, bring your back up nice and 
tall, and place your palms together in the prayer position with the 
thumbs touching the sternum (breastbone) in the middle of your chest 
(see Figure 13-2a).
 
2. As you inhale, open your palms and slightly raise your arms forward 
and then up and overhead; raise your buttocks away from your 
heels, arch your back, and look up at the ceiling as illustrated in 
Figure 13-2b.
 
3. As you exhale, bend forward slowly from the hips, placing your 
palms, forearms, and then your forehead on the floor and pause 
relaxing your hip. as Figure 13-2c shows.
 
4. Slide your hands forward on the floor until your arms are extended 
and then slide your chest forward, bending your elbows slightly, and 
arch up into cobra II as shown in Figure 13-2d.
 
 Flip to Chapter 11 for instructions on cobra II.

5. As you exhale, turn your toes under, raise your hips up, extend your 
legs, and bring your chest down keeping both hands on the floor for 
the downward-facing dog (see Figure 13-2e).
 
6. As you inhale, bend your knees to the floor and look straight ahead 
like in Figure 13-2f.
 
7. As you exhale, sit back on your heels and return your hands to the 
saluting position as in Step 1 (Figure 13-2g).
Repeat the entire sequence 3 to 12 times.

172
Part II: Postures for Health Maintenance and Restoration 
 
If you are not able to sit on your heels in Steps 1 and 7, simply keep your 
palms in prayer position and stand on your knees instead. You can also fold a 
blanket under your knees for comfort.
 
If you find this 7-step salutation too difficult for you, head to the following 
section and try Steps 1 through 3 only of the 12-step version until you’re ready 
to do more.
Advancing to the 12-Step Sun Salutation
To enjoy the greatest benefit from this sequence (as well as all your Yoga 
postures), execute each part with full participation of your mind. When you 
stand, really stand; plant your feet firmly on the ground. When you bend 
or stretch, bend or stretch with complete attention. Your mind makes your 
practice not only elegant but also potent. Use any of the Yoga breathing tech-
niques from Chapter 5 and follow these steps:
 
1. Start in a standing position with your feet at hip width and place your 
palms together in the prayer position with your thumbs touching 
the sternum (breastbone) in the middle of your chest as Figure 13-3a 
illustrates.
 
2. As you inhale, open your palms slightly and raise your arms forward 
and up and overhead; arch your back and look up at the ceiling (see 
Figure 13-3b).
Shedding light on the benefits of sun saluting
Respected for its excellent effects, the sun sal-
utation reputedly provides an array of benefits, 
including the following:
 ✓ Stretching your spine and strengthening 
the muscles that support it
 ✓ Strengthening and stretching your arms 
and legs
 ✓ Improving your posture, coordination, and 
endurance
 ✓ Complementing the delicate balance between 
muscle tension and muscle relaxation
 ✓ Linking body, breath, and mind
 ✓ Granting (in most of its forms) aerobic benefits
 ✓ Improving your lung function and the deliv-
ery of oxygen to your muscles (including the 
heart)
 ✓ Working well (with modifications) for 
people of all ages, from children to seniors
The Yoga masters claim that the sun saluta-
tion has deeper psychological and spiritual 
implications because it stimulates subtle vital 
energies leading to states of higher awareness. 
No wonder so many Yoga videos on the market 
today include the sun salutation!

173
 Chapter 13: Dynamic Posture
 
3. As you exhale, bend forward from the hips, soften your knees (as in Forgiv-
ing Limbs, covered in Chapter 3 ), and place your hands on the floor; 
bring your head as close as possible to your legs as shown in Figure 13-3c.
 
4. As you inhale, bend your left knee and step your right foot back into 
a lunge.
 
 Make sure that your left knee is directly over your ankle and your thigh 
is parallel to the floor, so that your knee forms a right angle. Look 
straight ahead; Figure 13-3d gives you a visual of this step.
 
5. As you exhale, step your left foot back beside the right and hold a 
push-up position; if your arms tire, bend your knees to the floor and 
pause on your hands and knees (see Figure 13-3e).
 
6. Inhale and then as you exhale, lower your knees (from the push-up), 
chest, and chin to the floor, keeping your buttocks up in the air as 
illustrated in Figure 13-3f.
 
7. As you inhale, slide your chest forward along the floor and then arch 
back into cobra II as in Figure 13-3g.
 
8. As you exhale, turn your toes under, raise your hips up, extend your 
legs, and bring your chest down, keeping both hands on the floor as 
shown in Figure 13-3h.
 
9. As you inhale, step your right foot forward between your hands and 
look straight ahead (see Figure 13-3i).
 
10. As you exhale, step your left foot forward, parallel to and even with 
the right; soften your knees and fold into a forward bend as in Step 3 
and Figure 13-3j.
 
11. As you inhale, raise your arms either forward and up overhead from 
the front, or out and up from the sides like wings, and then arch back 
and look up, as in Step 2 as Figure 13-3k indicates.
 
 If you have back problems, lifting up from the forward bend with your 
arms to the front or sides may cause you some discomfort. If so, you 
can try the roll up: Keep your chin on your chest and roll up, stacking 
the vertebrae one at a time, with your arms hanging at your sides, head 
coming up last. When you’re fully upright, bring the arms forward, up, 
and overhead from the front, arch your back just a little, and look up.
 
12. As you exhale, return your hands to the prayer position as in Step 1 
and Figure 13-3l.
Repeat the entire sequence 3 to 12 times. First lead with the right foot, and 
then alternate with the left foot, for an equal number of repetitions (each side 
counts as half a sequence).
 
If you’re ready for greater challenges, consider the advanced sun salutations 
in Power Yoga For Dummies by Doug Swenson (Wiley) from the Ashtanga Yoga 
system, or check the Internet for the Iyengar sun salutation or various “flow” 
sequences.

A Recommended Beginners’ 
Routine for Men and Women
In This Chapter
▶ Keeping current on basic Yoga principles
▶ Presenting a basic Yoga routine for beginners
T
he Yoga routine in this chapter is a tried-and-true sequence from my 
(Larry’s) Larry Payne’s Prime of Life Yoga and is an excellent way for a 
beginner to get started. Taught around the world, this sequence has helped 
thousands of people — including the staff at the J. Paul Getty Museum in 
Los Angeles and, slightly further from home base, 100 members of the World 
Presidents Organization (a diverse and successful international organization 
of CEOs) meeting all the way up at the North Pole. The routine is safe and 
doable and includes segments that reduce stress and increase strength, flex-
ibility, and overall pep and vitality.
Starting Off Slowly and Wisely
Most people find that they can successfully incorporate 15 to 20 minutes of 
practicing a new endeavor into their day on a regular basis. This chapter pro-
vides you with a short asana routine about that length designed to help you 
jump-start your Yoga practice. By practicing this routine three to six times 
per week, you’ll notice improvements in your flexibility, muscle tone and 
strength, and concentration. Very likely, you’ll notice a number of other ben-
efits as well, such as better stamina, digestion, and sleep.
When practicing the postures that we describe in the following section, 
either follow the directions for breath and movement or simply stay in each 
posture for six to eight breaths.
 
Because this may be your first Yoga experience — and you may have turned 
directly to this chapter — following is a quick trip through some basic Yoga 
principles you want to keep in mind:

176
Part II: Postures for Health Maintenance and Restoration 
 
✓ Yoga isn’t competitive. Be patient. If you follow the directions, you will 
improve over time no matter what your starting level.
 
✓ Move slowly into and out of the postures. Never rush your Yoga ses-
sion. Remember that coming out of a posture is an integral part of the 
posture itself.
 
✓ Use yogic breathing throughout the routine and pause briefly after 
each inhalation and exhalation. Chapter 5 gives you more info on yogic 
breathing.
 
✓ Challenge but don’t strain yourself. Yoga should never hurt or cause you 
pain. Check out Chapters 2 and 3 for more on the proper Yoga attitude.
 
✓ Move smoothly into and out of a posture several times before holding 
the posture. Doing so prepares your body for a deeper stretch and helps 
you concentrate on linking the body, breath, and mind as we discuss in 
Chapter 5.
 
✓ Don’t change the order of the sequence and just randomly pick the 
postures you want. All the routines have a special order or sequence to 
give you the maximum benefits. (For details about how to put together 
your own routines, see Chapter 15.)
Trying Out a Fun Beginner Routine
As you perform the postures in this short routine, notice how you start by 
giving your body and mind a chance to transition from your prior activity, 
how you move your body in several different directions, and how you end 
the routine with rest. These are some of the fundamental elements of a well-
balanced Yoga routine, regardless of its length. Use focus breathing (which 
we cover in Chapter 5) throughout the routine.
Corpse posture
 
1. Lie flat on your back with your arms relaxed along the sides of your 
torso and your palms up as shown in Figure 14-1.

Reaching Beyond the Beginning
After you become comfortable with the beginners’ routine in this chapter, 
you can expand it and add variety by following the guidelines we present in 
Chapter 15, where we walk you through designing your own Yoga program. If 
you’re young and fit, you may want to try the routines in Chapter 17. If you’re 
at mid life or older or haven’t exercised for a while, Chapter 18 provides less 
strenuous (but equally beneficial) routines.
Of course, with a taste of Hatha Yoga, you may want to take private lessons or 
go to a group class for feedback, to boost your morale, or simply to practice — 
with new confidence — in the company of others.
 
Practicing on your own is fine, but nothing replaces working with a teacher. 
Before you get into too much of a Yoga groove, we recommend that you ask a 
Yoga teacher to check for any bad postural habits and, if you like, to give you 
some suggestions for taking the next step.

ariety is the spice of life, and we trust you’ll soon

postures you’re already familiar with and more.
We also show you how Yoga suits people of all ages and

Designing Your Own 
Yoga Program
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding posture sequencing
▶ Warming up to your session
▶ Exploring main and compensation postures
▶ Taking a rest during your routine
▶ Using the Classic Formula to create routines that suit your time frame
T
he art and science of sequencing in Yoga is called vinyasa-krama (pro-
nounced veen-yah-sah-krah-mah). In the Sanskrit language, the word vin-
yasa means “placement” and krama means “step” or “process.” This concept 
is often called “flow.” The flow of postures is very important, and paying 
attention to proper sequencing can help you derive maximum benefit from 
your Hatha Yoga session.
Before you experiment with various Yoga postures, you need to know how 
to combine postures correctly. The more you know about sequencing, the 
better. Understanding sequencing is like figuring out how to unlock the door 
of a bank vault. You may have a list of all of the correct numbers, but if you 
don’t know the correct combination, you can never open the door to the 
treasures hidden in the vault. In this chapter, we give you the secret combi-
nation, the essential rules for postural sequencing, so that you can create a 
Yoga program that’s just right for you.
 
If you’re dealing with a specific health challenge, you need to work one-on-
one, under the guidance of your doctor, with a Yoga therapist or other health 
professional. This chapter focuses on “do-it-yourself” Hatha Yoga for general 
conditioning and stress reduction. Our emphasis is on prevention rather than 
therapy.

188
Part III: Creative Yoga 
Applying the Rules of Sequencing
The sequence of postures depends on the overall format of your Yoga ses-
sion, which in turn depends on your specific goals. What do you have in mind 
for your Yoga practice? What do you expect to accomplish? Are you inter-
ested in a simple stress reduction program, or do you want to put together 
a routine for general conditioning? After you establish your goal, you need 
a plan that can bring you safely and intelligently to your goal. A good plan 
includes these considerations:
 
✓ Your starting point
 
✓ Your next activity
 
✓ Your available time
Taking these factors into consideration helps you remain in the moment 
during your practice session.
After you establish your goals, you’re ready to apply the rules of sequenc-
ing to achieve the best possible flow of exercises. Sequencing has many 
approaches, and we encourage you to consult a qualified teacher. (See 
Chapter 2 for more on setting goals and picking a teacher.) However, you 
can’t go wrong when you bear in mind the following four basic categories:
 
✓ Warm-up or preparation
 
✓ Main postures
 
✓ Compensation
 
✓ Rest
Know thy schedule
Early in my teaching career, before I (Larry) had 
learned sequencing, I received a call from a 
high-level, highly stressed executive at a major 
corporation to arrange a private Yoga session 
in his office. I taught him a 30-minute routine 
and then asked him to lie on the floor with his 
feet up on a chair. I covered his eyes, recom-
mended long exhalations, and then gave him a 
long, guided relaxation. He became so relaxed 
and looked so comfortable that I didn’t want to 
disturb him when it was time for me to leave. 
He had already paid me, so I left thinking he’d 
appreciate continuing the relaxation on his 
own. What I didn’t know was that he was giving 
a presentation shortly after the class. His sec-
retary had to wake him in a hurry, and he was 
so spaced out for his presentation that he was 
even accused of being on drugs. The moral of 
the story: Never pay your Yoga instructor ahead 
of time. Just kidding. The true moral is that 
you should always take your next activity into 
account when designing your Yoga session.

189
 Chapter 15: Designing Your Own Yoga Program
 
Follow each step-by-step instruction carefully to avoid injuring yourself and 
also to enjoy maximum benefits. Always move into and out of the posture 
slowly, and pause after the inhalation and exhalation; we give you the details 
on correct breathing in Chapter 5.
The first part of this chapter includes some sample warm-up, compensation, 
and rest postures. The main postures are covered earlier in the book and are 
referred to throughout the chapter. The latter part of the chapter gives you a 
recipe to design your own Yoga routine using these concepts.
Getting Started with Warm-Ups
Any physical exercise requires adequate warm-up, and Yoga is no exception. 
Warm-up exercises increase circulation to the parts of your body that you’re 
about to use and make you more aware of those areas of your physical self. 
What’s different about the Yoga warm-up (called preparation postures) is that 
you do it slowly and deliberately with conscious breathing and awareness. 
It’s integral to the Yoga session.
Here are some of the benefits of yogic warm-up:
 
✓ Brings awareness and presence of mind
 
✓ Allows you to test your body before executing the postures
 
✓ Increases the temperature and blood supply to your muscles, joints, and 
connective tissue
 
✓ Prepares your body for more challenging demands and reduces the pos-
sibility of muscle tear or strain
 
✓ Enhances the supply of oxygen and nutrients, thus providing more stam-
ina for the practice
 
✓ Prevents muscle soreness
You typically perform warm-up postures dynamically, which means you move 
in and out of them. In general, the safest Yoga warm-ups are simple forward 
bends and easy sequences that fold and unfold the body. Figure 15-1 shows 
some of our recommended warm-up exercises. You may select from the vari-
ous reclining, sitting, and standing positions in this chapter. Normally, two or 
three postures are used for an adequate warm-up.
 
If you have disc problems in your lower back, forward bends may not be a 
good way to warm-up. Check with your medical or chiropractic doctor.

 Chapter 15: Designing Your Own Yoga Program
Warm-up or preparation postures are also used throughout a given routine 
to precede and enhance the effect of the main postures. (See Figure 15-2 for 
some samples.) For example, the leg lift just before a seated forward bend to 
stretch the hamstrings; the bridge posture just prior to a shoulder stand.

Avoid warming up with more complex postures such as shoulder stands (see 
Figure 15-3a), advanced back bends (Figure 15-3b), or deep twists (Figure 
15-3c). Also, we suggest avoiding a heavy cardiovascular workout before a 
strenuous Yoga practice because you can experience muscle cramps.

Reclining warm-up postures
Most Yoga practitioners enjoy reclining (supine) exercises because the postures 
are intrinsically relaxing. When you pair them with warm-ups, the combination 
effectively allows you to warm-up specific muscles or muscle groups while keep-
ing the other muscles at rest. You’re having your cake and eating it too.
The following warm-up exercises require you to start with the corpse posture 
(or dead posture), which we describe in Chapter 4. These exercises help 
revive you even when you start your Yoga session dead tired (pun intended).
Lying arm raise
Many of the muscles that go to the neck start between your shoulder blades. 
Raising the arms brings circulation to frequent sights of tension. You can see 
an illustration in Figure 15-1a.
 
1. Lie flat on your back with your arms relaxed at your sides and your 
palms turned down.
 
2. As you inhale, slowly raise your arms over your head and touch the 
floor.
 
3. As you exhale, bring your arms back to your sides as in Step 1.
 
4. Repeat Steps 1 through 3, six to eight times.
The double breath
If you want to double your pleasure, the double breath enhances tension 
release in your body and prepares your muscles for the main postures.
 
1. Repeat Steps 1 and 2 of the lying arm raise in the preceding section.

193
 Chapter 15: Designing Your Own Yoga Program
 
2. After you raise your arms overhead on the inhalation, leave them on 
the floor above your head and fully exhale.
 
 Your arms should remain where they are for another inhalation while 
you deeply stretch your entire body from the tips of your toes to your 
fingertips.
 
3. On the next exhalation, return your arms to your sides and relax your 
legs; repeat 3 to 4 times.
Knee-to-chest posture
Use this exercise for either warm-up or compensation. The knee-to-chest 
posture is also a classic in lower-back programs (see Chapter 22 for more on 
Yoga therapy for low-back troubles). Figure 15-1c shows you what it looks like.
 
1. Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor.
 
2. As you exhale, bring your right knee into your chest, holding your 
shin just below your knee
 
 If you have knee problems, hold the back of your thigh rather than 
your shin
 
3. If you can do so comfortably, straighten your left leg on the floor.
 
 If you have back problems, though, keep your left knee bent.
 
4. Repeat Steps 1 through 3 on the other side, holding each side for 6 to 
8 breaths.
Double leg extension
This exercise, which uses both legs simultaneously, has a dual function. It 
prepares the lower back and gently stretches the hamstrings. 
Check it out in Figure 15-1c.
 
1. Lie on your back and bring your bent knees toward your chest.
 
2. Hold the backs of your thighs at arms’ length.
 
3. As you inhale, straighten both legs perpendicular to the floor; as you 
exhale, bend both legs again.
 
4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 six to eight times.
Hamstring stretch
Without the hamstrings (the muscles and the associated tendons), you’d 
have to let your fingers do all the walking. The hamstrings can be injured 
quite easily, especially if you overwork them, so you want to prepare them 
properly for exercise. Refer to Figure 15-4 for a visual.

194

1. Lying on your back with your legs straight, place your arms along 
your sides with your palms down.
 
2. Bend just your left knee and put that foot on the floor (see Figure 15-4a).
 
3. As you exhale, bring your right leg up as straight as possible (see 
Figure 15-4b). As you inhale, return your right leg to the floor.
 
 Keep your head and your hips on the floor.
 
4. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 three times and then, with your hands inter-
locked on the back of your raised thigh just above your knee, hold 
your leg in place for 6 to 8 breaths (see Figure 15-4c).
 
5. Repeat Steps 1 through 4 on the other side.

Dynamic bridge: Dvipada pitha
You can use this exercise for warm-up and compensation and as a main pos-
ture. The Sanskrit term dvipada means “two-footed” and pitha means “seat,” 
which is a synonym for asana. (The pronunciation is dvee-pah-dah peet-hah.)
 
1. Lie on your back with your knees bent, feet flat on the floor at hip width, 
and your arms at your sides with palms turned down (see Figure 15-5a).

195
 Chapter 15: Designing Your Own Yoga Program
 
2. As you inhale, raise your hips to a comfortable height (see Figure 
15-5b).
 
3. As you exhale, return your hips to the floor.
 
4. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 six to eight times.

Bridge variation with arm raise
This posture is another good candidate for both warm-up and compensation.
 
1. Lie on your back with your knees bent, your feet flat on the floor at 
hip width, and your arms at your sides with palms turned down (refer 
to Figure 15-5a).
 
2. As you inhale, raise your hips to a comfortable height and at the same 
time raise your arms overhead to touch the floor (see Figure 15-6).
 
3. As you exhale, return your hips to the floor and your arms to your sides.
 
4. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 six to eight times.

Dynamic head-to-knee
The dynamic head-to-knee is a nice warm-up before a slightly more physical 
routine.
 
Dynamic head-to-knee is a little more vigorous kind of warm-up. Don’t perform 
this sequence if you’re having neck problems.

196
Part III: Creative Yoga 
 
1. Lie flat on your back with your arms relaxed at your sides and you 
palms turned down as shown in Figure 15-1a earlier in the chapter.
 
2. As you inhale, raise your arms slowly overhead and touch the floor.
 
3. As you exhale, draw your right knee toward your chest, lift your head 
off the floor, and then grasp your right knee with your hands.
 
 Keep your hips on the floor. Bring your head as close to your knee as 
possible, but don’t force it. Figure 15-7 shows you what this position 
looks like.
 
4. As you inhale, release your knee and return your head, arms, and 
straightened right leg to the floor as they are in Step 2.
 
5. Repeat Steps 2 through 4 six to eight times on each side, alternating 
right and left.
 
To make the sequence a little easier, keep your head on the floor in Step 3.

Standing warm-up postures
The standing postures are probably the most versatile of all the groups. They 
can be used for warm-up/preparation, compensation, or as main postures. As 
a warm-up, use standing postures when the next part of your routine is also 
performed from a standing position.

197
 Chapter 15: Designing Your Own Yoga Program
Standing arm raise
You can perform this versatile warm-up (shown in Figure 15-1e) almost any-
where you want to enjoy a complete break from sitting. Try it at the office 
and start a new trend.
 
1. Stand tall but relaxed with your feet at hip width.
 
2. Hang your arms at your sides with your palms turned back.
 
 Look straight ahead.
 
3. As you inhale, raise your arms forward and then up overhead.
 
4. As you exhale, bring your arms down and back to your sides.
 
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 six to eight times.
The head-turner
 
Sequences like the head-turner combine breath and movement in parts of 
the upper body to stretch, strengthen, and heal your entire wingspan. This 
breath and movement sequence for the upper back and neck is great for 
minor stiff necks.
 
1. Stand tall but relaxed with your feet at hip width.
 
2. Hang your arms at your sides, palms turned back.
 
 Look straight ahead.
 
3. As you inhale, raise your right arm forward and up overhead as you 
turn your head to the left as Figure 15-8 illustrates.
 
4. As you exhale, bring your arm down and turn your head forward.
 
5. As you inhale, raise your left arm forward and up overhead while 
turning your head to the right.
 
6. Repeat Steps 3 through 5 six to eight times on each side, alternating 
right and left.

Shoulder rolls
Shoulder rolls are used in many types of exercise routines; but when done in 
Yoga, you move slowly and with awareness, coordinating with the breath.
 
1. Stand tall but relaxed with your feet at hip width.
 
2. Hang your arms at your sides with your palms turned back.
 
 Look straight ahead.
 
3. As you inhale, roll your shoulders up and back as shown in Figure 
15-9. As you exhale, drop your shoulders down.
 
4. Repeat Step 3 six to eight times, reversing the direction of the rolls.

Dynamic standing forward bend
Like many other warm-ups, you can also use this exercise for compensation.
 
1. Stand tall but relaxed with your feet at hip width.
 
2. Hang your arms at your sides with your palms turned back.
 
3. As you inhale, raise your arms forward and up overhead (see Figure 
15-10a).
 
4. As you exhale, bend forward, and when you feel a pull in the back of 
your legs, bend your legs and arms slightly (see Figure 15-10b).
 
 This position is called Forgiving Limbs, and we cover it in Chapter 3.

200

5. As you inhale, roll up slowly, stacking the bones of your spine one at 
a time from bottom to top; then raise your arms overhead and finally, 
release your arms back to your sides.
 
6. Repeat Steps 3 through 5 six to eight times.

Rolling up is the safest way to come up in Step 5. If you don’t have back problems, 
you may want to try two more advanced techniques after a few weeks: As you 
come up, sweep your arms out and up from the sides like wings, then overhead. 
Alternately, as you inhale, extend your slightly bent arms forward and up until 
they’re parallel with your ears. Then raise your upper back, your mid back, and 
then your lower back until you’re all the way up and your arms are overhead.
Seated warm-up postures
Yoga postures provide a very broad spectrum of possibilities. You can do an 
entire routine from a seated position, including forward bends, back bends, 
side bends, and twists. In this section, we show you how to prepare for main 
postures from a seated position. (Note: Most of the postures here utilize the 
easy posture, sukhasana. Check out that discussion in Chapter 6.)

201
 Chapter 15: Designing Your Own Yoga Program
Seated fold
The seated fold is a very simple way to warm-up your back for forward bends 
or to compensate after seated twists.
 
1. Sit on the floor with your legs crossed in the easy posture and place 
your hands on the floor in front of you with palms down (refer to 
Figure 15-1b for a visual).
 
2. As you exhale, slide your hands out along the floor and bend forward 
at the hips.
 
 If possible, bring your head down to the floor; otherwise, just come as 
close as you comfortably can.
 
3. As you inhale, roll your torso and head up and return to the starting 
position in Step 1.
 
4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 four to six times and then switch your legs and 
repeat four to six times.
 
If you have a disc-related back problem, exercise caution with forward bends.
Rock the baby
This series prepares you for advanced sitting postures and forward bends.
 
1. Sit on the floor with your legs stretched out in front of you.
 
 Press your hands on the floor behind you for support
 
2. Shake your legs out.
 
3. Bend your right knee and place your right foot just above your 
left knee with your right ankle to the outside of the left knee (see 
Figure 15-11a).
 
4. Stabilize your right foot with your left hand and your right knee with 
your right hand; swing your right knee up and down 6 to 8 times by 
gently pressing and then releasing the inner right thigh.
 
5. Carefully lift your right foot up and cradle it in the crook of your left 
elbow; cradle your right knee in the crook of your right elbow and, if 
you can, interlock your fingers (see Figure 15-11b).
 
6. Lift your spine and rock your right leg gently side to side 6 to 8 times.
 
7. Repeat Steps 1 through 6 with the left leg.
 
8. Shake your legs out.
 
If you can’t do this sequence without pain, don’t try the more advanced seated 
postures in Chapter 6. Moreover, we don’t recommend the rock the baby 
sequence if you have knee or hip problems.

Selecting Your Main Postures 
and Compensation Poses
After your body is warmed up, you can move into what we refer to as the 
main postures, the central part of the routine. Interspersed between the main 
postures are compensation postures, which allow your body to come back 
into balance after each main posture and prevent discomfort and injury.
Getting stronger with standard asanas
The main postures are the standard asanas you find featured in the classical 
Yoga texts and modern manuals. These asanas are the stars of your routine, 
requiring you to work a little harder. The chapters of Part II describe many of 
the main postures that we recommend for beginners. Figure 15-12 shows you 
some examples. Whichever asanas you select, remember to match them with 
your specific goals.
 
Whenever possible, a warm-up posture precedes and a compensation posture 
follows each category of main postures.
The number of postures you select for your Yoga session depends on your 
available time and your goals. Later in this chapter, we provide you with a 
framework for selecting postures for varying lengths of time, as well as guide-
lines to create routines that focus on general conditioning, stress reduction, 
preparation for meditation, and a quick pick-me-up.

Bringing balance with 
compensation postures
Compensation is part of bringing you back into balance, which is a key con-
cept in Yoga. Use compensation postures to unwind or bring your body back 
into neutral, especially after strenuous postures.
Here are some basic guidelines for using compensation postures:
 
✓ Use one or two simple compensation postures to neutralize tension you 
feel in any area of the body after a Yoga posture or sequence.
 
✓ Always use the conscious breathing we describe in Chapter 5.
 
✓ Perform compensating postures that are simpler or less difficult than 
the main posture right after the main posture. Do them dynamically.
 
✓ Don’t follow a strenuous posture with another strenuous posture in 
the opposite direction. Some Yoga instructors teach the fish posture as 
compensating for the shoulder stand. However, this combination can 
cause problems, especially for beginners, so we recommend the less 
strenuous cobra posture instead.
 
✓ Use compensation postures even when you feel no immediate need for 
them, especially after deep back bends, twists, and inverted postures.
 
✓ Gentle forward bends typically compensate back bends, twists, and 
side bends.
 
✓ Many forward bends are self-compensating. However, we follow with 
gentle back bends after doing a lot of forward bending.
 
✓ Rest after strenuous postures, such as inverted postures or deep back 
bends, before beginning the compensation postures.
Following are some great compensation postures.
The dynamic cat
The dynamic cat is a very nice compensation posture for twists, but you can 
also use it for warm-up.
 
1. Starting on your hands and knees, look straight ahead.
 
2. Place your knees at hip width with your hands below your shoulders 
(see Figure 15-13a).
 
 Straighten but don’t lock your elbows.

205
 Chapter 15: Designing Your Own Yoga Program
 
3. As you exhale, sit back on your heels and look at the floor (see 
Figure 15-13b).
 
4. As you inhale, slowly return to the starting position in Step 1.
 
 Again, look straight ahead.
 
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 six to eight times.

Dynamic knees-to-chest
You can find many variations of knees-to-chest (including the regular version 
later in this chapter), but this variation is especially good after back bends.
 
1. Lie on your back and bend your knees toward your chest.
 
2. Hold your legs just below your knees, one hand on each leg (see 
Figure 15-14a).
 
 If you have any knee problems, be sure to hold the backs of your thighs.
 
3. As you exhale, draw your knees toward your chest (see Figure 15-14b).
 
4. As you inhale, move your knees away from your chest.
 
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 six to eight times.

Thunderbolt posture: Vajrasana
This exercise is useful for compensation or warm-up. Vajra (pronounced 
vahj-rah) means both “diamond/adamantine” and “thunderbolt.”
 
1. Kneel on the floor with your knees and feet at hip width.
 
2. Sit back on your heels and bring your back up nice and tall. Hang 
your arms close to your sides.
 
3. As you inhale, lift your hips back up and sweep your arms up over 
your head (see Figure 15-15a).
 
 Lean back and look up.
 
4. As you exhale, sit on your heels again, fold your chest to your thighs, 
and bring your arms behind your back (see Figure 15-15b).
 
 Get into a nice flow. Inhale when you open, exhale when you fold.
 
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 six to eight times.
 
Don’t perform the thunderbolt if you have knee problems.

 Chapter 15: Designing Your Own Yoga Program
Including Plenty of Rest and Relaxation
Rest periods are an indispensable part of any good Yoga routine. Rest isn’t 
just zoning out at the end of a session. In Yoga, a quiet interval is an active 
tool for enhancing the quality of your practice at the following times:
 
✓ Before the beginning of a class to shift gears and establish a union 
between your body, breath, and mind
 
✓ Between postures to renew and prepare for the next posture
 
✓ As part of compensation after strenuous postures
 
✓ To restore proper breathing
 
✓ For self-observation
 
✓ To prepare for relaxation techniques
Knowing when to rest and when to resume
 
The two best indicators of the need to rest are your breath and energy level. 
Monitor yourself throughout the session. If your breath is loud and uneven, 
rest. If you feel a little tired after a posture, rest.
No formula can prescribe how long you need to rest. Simply rest as needed 
until you’re ready for the next posture. Don’t cheat yourself out of well-
deserved rest periods between the postures and at the end of a session.
Rest postures
Figure 15-16 shows you some recommended rest postures.
 
Stay in any rest posture for 6 to 12 breaths or as long as it takes to feel rested, 
which may depend on how much time you have and where you are in the 
sequence of the routine. Yoga should never feel like you’re in a hurry.
Corpse posture: Shavasana
The word shava (pronounced shah-vah) means “corpse”; this posture is also 
called the dead pose or mritasana, from mrita (pronounced mree-tah) mean-
ing “dead” and asana meaning “posture.” Refer to Figure 15-16a and Chapter 4 
for a full description of the posture.

Follow the steps for shavasana in Chapter 4 but keep your knees bent with 
your feet on the floor at hip width as shown in Figure 15-16b.
 
If your back is uncomfortable, place a pillow or blanket roll under your knees. 
If your neck or throat is tense, place a folded blanket or small pillow under 
your head.
Easy posture: Sukhasana
The word sukha means “easy” or “pleasant” and indeed this posture is as its 
name suggests. You can keep your eyes open or closed in this posture. Check 
out Figure 15-16c and Chapter 6 for more details.

209
 Chapter 15: Designing Your Own Yoga Program
Mountain posture: Tadasana
The Sanskrit word tada (pronounced tah-dah) actually means “palm tree”; 
hence, this exercise is also called the palm tree posture.
 
1. Stand tall but relaxed with your feet at hip width.
 
 Your arms are at your sides with your palms turned toward the sides of 
the legs.
 
2. Visualize a vertical line connecting the hole in your ear, your shoul-
der joint, and the sides of your hip, knee, and ankle.
 
3. Look straight ahead with your eyes open or closed, as Figure 15-16d 
illustrates.
Child’s posture: Balasana
The Sanskrit word bala (pronounced bah-lah) means “child.” This classic ver-
sion of child’s posture is a very nurturing pose.
 
1. Start on your hands and knees.
 
2. Place your knees about hip width, hands just below your shoulders.
 
 Keep your elbows straight but not locked.
 
3. As you exhale, sit back on your heels; rest your torso on your thighs 
and your forehead on the floor.
 
4. Lay your arms on the floor beside your torso with your palms up as 
shown in Figure 15-16e.
 
5. Close your eyes and breathe easily.
Child’s posture with arms in front
This variation of child’s posture gives you more stretch in your upper back. Follow 
the steps for the child’s posture in the preceding section but extend your arms 
forward at Step 4, spreading your palms on the floor as Figure 15-16f illustrates.
Knees-to-chest posture: Apanasana
The Sanskrit word apana (pronounced ah-pah-nah) refers to the downward-
going life force or exhalation.
 
1. Lie on your back and bend your knees in toward your chest.
 
2. Hold your shins just below the knees as in Figure 15-16g.
 
 If you have any knee problems, hold the backs of your thighs instead.

Part III: Creative Yoga 
Cooking Up a Creative Yoga Routine 
with the Classic Formula
When you create your own Yoga program with our classic formula, you
 
✓ Determine how long you want the routine to be
 
✓ Select the main postures from the range of postures covered in Chapters 
6 through 13 (or, of course, from any source you consider reliable)
 
✓ Decide how you want to prepare and/or compensate for each main cat-
egory of postures
 
✓ Allocate time for rest and for relaxation at the end in order to digest the 
nutritious meal of Yoga exercises that you prepared for yourself
 
What we call the Classic Formula consists of the following 12 categories:
 
1. Attunement (integrating body, breath, and mind)
 
2. Warm-up/preparation (also used between main exercises wherever 
necessary)
 
3. Standing postures
 
4. Balance postures (optional)
 
5. Abdominals
 
6. Inversions (optional)
 
7. Back bends
 
8. Forward bends
 
9. Twists
 
10. Rest (to be inserted between main exercises whenever you 
feel the need)
 
11. Compensation (to be inserted after main exercises)
 
12. Final relaxation
You don’t have to use every category as long as you follow the proper 
sequence from 1 to 9 and always conclude with 12. Depending on your avail-
able time, you may choose to omit number 4 or 6 and continue, or even stop 
the asanas after number 5 if time is short and jump to step 12. You can repeat 
the categories of rest, warm-up/preparation, and compensation wherever 
appropriate. Balancing postures and inversions are optional because their 
inclusion depends on your available time, wallspace, and your skill level.
The Classic Formula is optimal for 30- to 60-minute general conditioning pro-
grams, but we also refer to it in the 15- and 5-minute programs. The beauty 

211
 Chapter 15: Designing Your Own Yoga Program
of our formula is that as your Yoga practice grows over the years, you can 
explore safe postures from any book or system and then insert them into 
their appropriate slots within our 12-category module.
A postural feast: The 30- to 60-minute 
general-conditioning routine
Most beginning Yoga students find sustaining more than a 30-minute practice 
on their own difficult; however, if your appetite increases, we want you to 
have the tools to be a 60-minute gourmet. Simply follow the recipes in each of 
the categories to create your own great, custom routine.
 
Plan for an average of about two minutes for each posture you select. Some 
postures take more time, some take less. Doing both sides of an asymmetrical 
or one-side-at-a-time (right and left) posture like the warrior (see Chapter 7) is 
counted as one exercise or posture. If you choose our sun salutation or a simi-
lar dynamic series from Chapters 13 and 15 or another source, double or triple 
the time allotted depending on the series and the number of repetitions.
Note: As we indicate throughout this chapter, you can use many of these 
postures in more than one category when developing a general-conditioning 
routine.
 
The simplest way to expand a 30-minute routine into a 45-minute routine is to 
do two sets of your chosen standing postures and add one extra posture to 
the abdominal, back bend, and forward bend categories.
Attunement
Attunement allows you to establish the conscious link between your body, 
breath, and mind or awareness. If you forget about the attunement stage, you 
miss much of what makes Yoga, Yoga.
First, for routines of any length, select a style of breathing from Chapter 5. 
If you’re a beginner, choose something simple like focus breathing or belly 
breathing. Later you can try either the classic three-part breathing or chest-
to-belly breathing or adopt the ujjayi technique.
 
Be sure not to confuse these styles of breathing with the traditional tech-
niques of breath control (pranayama) that we also describe in Chapter 5.
Next, select one of the resting postures from earlier in this chapter or a seated 
posture from Chapter 6, depending on your frame of mind, physical condi-
tion, or what you have planned for the rest of your routine. The corpse pos-
ture (lying flat on your back) is always a good starting point for beginners. 
It’s a great way to shift gears from a hectic lifestyle and slow things down 
before beginning your postural exercises. Lying flat on your back definitely 

212
Part III: Creative Yoga 
shifts your mood toward relaxation. However, sitting in the easy posture or 
standing in the mountain posture are also great starting points. Figure 15-16 
shows some examples of rest postures that you can use to help achieve 
attunement.
Use 8 to 12 breaths to achieve attunement. The more you pay attention to 
your breath and attunement, the more benefit you can expect to derive from 
your program. Think of the benefits you receive as “mileage plus.”
Warm-up
You may notice that almost all the warm-ups we describe earlier in this chap-
ter are folding and opening motions (flexion and extension). Either motion 
provides the easiest way for your body to prepare for breath and movement. 
Select a warm-up posture or sequence that is a similar position to your attun-
ement posture.
 
Make your Yoga practice as smooth as possible. Flow like a gentle river. For 
example, do both the attunement and warm-up on the floor; then stand for the 
next series of postures. Avoid getting up and down like a yo-yo. Economy of 
movement is one of the principles of good Hatha Yoga practice.
 
In a routine of 30 minutes or more, you usually have time for at least two 
warm-up postures. Because the neck is a frequent site of tension, we suggest 
using a warm-up posture that incorporates moving the arms. In addition to 
stretching the spine, arm movement prepares your neck and shoulders and 
helps you release tension. Also, warm-ups that move the legs and prepare the 
lower back are helpful for the standing postures that usually follow. Check out 
“Getting Started with Warm-ups” earlier in the chapter for some examples of 
common warm-ups in the lying, sitting, and standing positions.
Standing postures
The standing postures tend to be the most physical part of a program. If 
you’re doing a 30-minute routine, you usually have time for three or four 
standing postures. In a 60-minute program, you may have as many as six or 
seven standing asanas. You can choose any of the standing postures from 
Chapter 7 for this portion of your routine.
 
As a general rule back bends, twists, and side bends (the hallmarks of many 
standing postures) come before forward bends. Therefore, you want to include 
standing forward bends after most of the standing postures you choose.
Figure 15-17 shows you examples of standing postures for a 30- or 60-minute 
program. As an alternative, you can choose the dynamic kneeling or standing 
sequence (sun salutation) or the standing rejuvenation sequence for begin-
ners from Chapter 13. The dynamic postures take the place of three to six 
standing postures, depending on which sequence you choose and how many 

213
 Chapter 15: Designing Your Own Yoga Program
rounds you do. When you select a dynamic sequence, try to allow time at the 
end for one twist and one compensating forward bend. We mention this note 
because all our dynamic sequences are forward and backward bends only.
 
If you want your routine to be more physically challenging, simply do two sets 
of the standing postures.
 
Figure 15-17: 
Examples 
of popular 
standing 
postures.
 
Balancing postures (optional)
Balancing postures are optional and depend on your time and stamina. 
They’re often the most athletic postures and require overall coordination. 
Balancing postures are very rewarding because you can see your progress 
immediately. They fit nicely after the standing postures because at this point 
in your routine, you’re fully warmed up. All our recommended balancing pos-
tures are either standing or kneeling, which means they fit smoothly into the 
sequence. Choose one balancing posture from Chapter 8 for a 30-minute to 
60-minute routine; Figure 15-18 shows you some options.

Rest
 
Most people usually welcome a rest at this point of the routine. Resting is usu-
ally done lying, sitting, or kneeling. We emphasize the importance of not feel-
ing rushed during your Yoga session. At least for the short duration of your 
routine, believe that you have all the time in the world. In a 30- or 60-minute 
routine, the first rest usually comes at the halfway point. This resting period 
gives you the opportunity for inward observation of any physical, mental, or 
emotional feedback resulting from your Yoga practice so far.
 
Remember that you need to rest until you feel ready to move on. If you’re 
really pinched for time, this first major rest is also a logical place to end a ses-
sion. Choose from any of our recommended resting postures in Figure 15-16, 
or any of the sitting postures that you’re comfortable with from Chapter 6.

215
 Chapter 15: Designing Your Own Yoga Program
Abdominals
We recommend that you include at least one (but not more than two) abdom-
inal postures in any program lasting 30 minutes or more. Think of your abdo-
men as the front of your back — a very important place. Choose one of the 
abdominal postures we describe in Chapter 9 for a 30-minute routine or 
one or two for a 60-minute routine. You can check out some examples in 
Figure 15-19.
 
Figure 15-19: 
Practice 
your yogi 
ab postures 
with a slow, 
coordinated 
breath.
 
Compensation and preparation
Take a short rest when you finish the abdominal exercises and then do six to 
eight repetitions of the dynamic bridge or bridge variation (both discussed 
earlier in the chapter and shown in Figure 15-5) or the lying arm raise (also 
covered earlier). The action of the dynamic bridge plays a dual function here 
because it compensates the abdomen, returning it to neutral, and also warms 
up or prepares the back and the neck if you choose to include an inversion 
posture or move on to back bends next.
Inversion (optional)
Indian Yoga teachers often teach inverted postures toward the beginning or 
at the end of a class. For Westerners, we prefer to introduce inverted pos-
tures closer to the middle of the routine, when they’ve properly prepared 
their backs and necks and have plenty of time for adequate compensation. 
Inverted postures like those shown in Figure 15-20 are optional, and we rec-
ommend that beginners avoid the half shoulder stand and the half shoulder 
stand at the wall until they’ve practiced Yoga for six to eight weeks.

216
Part III: Creative Yoga 
 
Figure 15-20: 
Inversions 
are power-
ful postures 
that deserve 
respect.
 
Attempt inversions only if you have no neck problems. Inverted postures are 
worthy of a healthy respect. They’re powerful postures that demand a sense 
of balance and strong muscles. We offer you several easy and safe inversion 
postures in Chapter 10. Select just one for your 30- to 60-minute routine, 
assuming you’re ready and want to include an inversion in your practice.
 
Even if you are ready for an inversion, we advise against practicing the shoul-
der stand or the half shoulder stand at the wall if any of the following condi-
tions applies to you: glaucoma, retinopathy, high blood pressure, a history of 
heart attacks or stroke, hiatal hernia, the first few days of menstruation, preg-
nancy, or 40 or more pounds of excess weight.
Compensation for inversions and preparation for back bends
You should rest after the simpler inverted postures, normally in the corpse pos-
ture (see Chapter 4). After the half shoulder stand, rest and then compensate 

217
 Chapter 15: Designing Your Own Yoga Program
further with any one of the cobra postures (see Chapter 11) or the thunder-
bolt posture (covered earlier in the chapter). Cobra I and the thunderbolt 
posture also prepare you for further back bends.
Back bends
It works as a compensation for inversion, but cobra I and II also are gentle 
back bends that serve as good preparation for more physical back bends, 
such as the locust posture. Westerners bend forward far too much, which 
makes back bends a vital part of your Hatha Yoga practice. Whenever possi-
ble in general-conditioning Yoga routines, select one back bend from Chapter 
11; in programs over 30 minutes, use two. Figure 15-21 shows some common 
back bends you can try.
 
Figure 15-21: 
Examples of 
four com-
mon back 
bends.
 
Compensation for back bends
The compensation for prone (lying face down) back bends is usually some 
form of a bent-knee forward bend (shown in Figure 15-22). We often recom-
mend the knees-to-chest posture or the child’s posture discussed earlier in 
the chapter. After more strenuous back bends, such as any of the varieties of 
the locust postures, we suggest a short rest followed by one of the bent-knee 
forward bends and then the dynamic bridge posture as a second compensa-
tory posture. This sequence helps neutralize the upper back and neck.
Preparation for forward bends
Preparation is particularly critical for extended leg forward bends. Stretching 
the hamstrings or the hips just before doing a seated forward bend (refer to 
Chapter 11) not only improves the posture but is also safer for your back. 
Use the hamstring stretch or the double leg stretch for a 30-minute routine. 
(see Figure 15-4). For a longer routine, use both and/or the rock the baby 
sequence (see Figure 15-11).

218
Part III: Creative Yoga 
 
Figure 15-22: 
Compen-
sating for

is an impor-
tant part of 
your Yoga 
program.
 
Forward bends
The seated forward bends normally come toward the end of an exercise 
program because they have a calming effect. Of all the postures described in 
this book, the seated extended-leg forward bends divide the sexes the most. 
Because of their higher muscle density, especially in the hip and groin area, 
men are usually tighter in the hamstrings. Preparation of the hamstrings is 
particularly important for them in these postures. If you have a hard time 
with this category, bend your knees more and, if necessary, place some blan-
kets under your hips to give yourself a better angle for the forward bends 
(which we cover in Chapter 11). For a 30-minute routine, choose just one 
forward bend from Chapter 11; pick two for a 60-minute routine. Figure 15-23 
shows you some possibilities. Alternately, you may substitute with one kneel-
ing or seated side bend from Chapter 11, and one seated or kneeling forward 
bend from earlier in this chapter for compensation.

219
 Chapter 15: Designing Your Own Yoga Program
 
Figure 15-23: 
Some for-
ward bend 
options.
 
Compensation for forward bends
The forward bends are usually self-compensating. However, sometimes you 
may want to use a gentle back bend like the dynamic bridge as a counter pose.
Preparation for twists
The preparation for all twists is a forward bend, so moving from forward 
bends to twists flows naturally. Check out the earlier section “Forward 
bends” for guidance on choosing a bend.
Twists
Twists, like forward bends, have an overall calming effect; the floor twists 
are the dessert in our program, because at the end of the routine they feel so 
good. Choose one floor twist from Chapter 12 for a 30-minute routine and one 
or two for a 60-minute routine. Figure 15-24 shows some common twists.
Compensation for twists
Compensation for twists is always flexion, or a forward bend. After a floor twist, 
we usually recommend choosing one of the lying knees-to-chest or the regular 
knees-to-chest postures in Figure 15-13 and Figure 15-4 earlier in the chapter.
Relaxation
 
No matter how short your program, remember to include some form of 
relaxation. Rest provides a place where you digest all the marvelous energy 
unleashed by your Yoga exercises. It’s like receiving “mileage plus” from your 
Yoga practice.

220
Part III: Creative Yoga 
 
Figure 15-24: 
Twists are 
calming 
postures, 
and they

feel good.
 
This final category in our classic formula can take several forms: a relaxation 
technique (see Chapter 4), pranayama yogic breathing (see Chapter 5), or 
meditation (see Chapter 21).
First, choose a rest posture or one of the seated postures from Chapter 6. 
Next, select one of the breathing or pranayama techniques from Chapter 5, 
a relaxation technique from Chapter 4, and/or a meditation technique from 
Chapter 21. In a 60-minute routine, you may choose both a breathing and a 
relaxation technique. Whichever technique you choose, use it for at least 2 to 
3 minutes and not more than 15 minutes.
Making the most of a little: 
A 15-minute routine
Sometimes you have only 15 minutes, but even 15 minutes of Hatha Yoga can 
put you back on an even keel and refresh you.

221
 Chapter 15: Designing Your Own Yoga Program
When you opt for a 15-minute program, you need to be specific about your 
goals. Some of the more common uses for a short routine are
 
✓ A quick general-conditioning program
 
✓ A stress-reduction and relaxation program
 
✓ A preparation program for Yoga breathing or meditation.
General conditioning
For the purposes of general conditioning, choose the following categories 
and do them in the order listed. You can also use the illustrations earlier in 
this chapter as a reference point.
 
Some of the postures below appear in this chapter; you can also find informa-
tion in the listed chapters.
 
✓ Either a standing or seated rest posture for attunement (flip to “Rest 
postures” earlier in this chapter as well as Chapters 6 and 7) and a Yoga 
breathing technique from Chapter 5.
 
✓ A dynamic series, such as either kneeling or standing sun salutation 
(Chapter 13); the rejuvenation sequence, which counts as three or four pos-
tures (also in Chapter 13) or three to four standing postures (see “Standing 
postures” earlier in this chapter plus Chapter 7) for six to eight minutes.
 
✓ A lying twist (see “Twists” earlier in this chapter as well as Chapter 12).
 
✓ Compensate with knees- or knee-to-chest postures (check out Figure 
15-13 earlier in the chapter).
 
✓ A lying or seated rest posture from the “Rest postures” section earlier in 
the chapter.
 
✓ A breathing exercise from Chapter 5 and/or a relaxation technique from 
Chapter 4.
Preparation for meditation and Yoga breathing
If you’re looking for a routine to help you reduce stress, just plain relax, or 
prepare for meditation and Yoga breathing, choose the following elements in 
the order listed:
 
✓ A lying or seated posture from this chapter’s “Rest postures” section 
or Chapter 6 or 7 for attunement and a Yoga breathing technique from 
Chapter 5. Repeat this or a similar posture at the end of the routine.
 
✓ Two lying warm-up postures from “Getting Started with Warm-ups” earlier in 
the chapter — one that moves the arms and the other that moves the legs.
 
✓ A prone back-bending posture such as cobra I or locust I (see this 
chapter’s “Back bends” and Chapter 11) or a lying back bend such as 
the bridge.

222
Part III: Creative Yoga 
 
✓ A bent knee compensation exercise such as the child’s posture or knees-
to-chest posture covered in “Compensation for back bends” earlier in 
the chapter.
 
✓ A lying hamstring posture such as rock the baby, covered earlier in the 
chapter.
 
✓ A lying twist (see this chapter’s “Twists” section as well as Chapter 12).
 
✓ A lying bent-knee compensation exercise as shown in Figure 15-14 earlier 
in the chapter.
Satisfy an appetite for a quick 
pick-me-up: A 5-minute routine
A 5-minute program is the easiest to create. For a busy person, even three to 
five minutes once or twice a day can provide beneficial effects. Settle into a 
rest posture or a seated posture from this chapter’s “Rest postures” section 
or Chapter 6 and then employ a yogic breathing or pranayama technique (see 
Chapter 5) for three to five minutes. You can come up with many possible 
combinations for a quick, relaxing, and enjoyable routine.

Chapter 16
It’s Never Too Soon: Pre- and 
Postnatal Yoga
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding Yoga’s pregnancy benefits
▶ Exploring some good pregnancy postures (plus a routine)
▶ Easing back into Yoga postpartum
T
he value of regular exercise isn’t lost just because you’re pregnant. In 
fact, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) 
recommends that pregnant women become physically active to help alleviate 
some of the common discomforts associated with pregnancy, prepare for 
childbirth, and get back into shape afterward.
In this chapter, we discuss the benefits of Yoga practice during pregnancy, 
go through the best poses for a pregnant body, and provide a quick and easy 
routine to try.
Partnering Yoga with Pregnancy
Taking a gentle approach to Yoga during pregnancy can be just what the 
doctor ordered. It may be just what the midwife ordered as well because it 
helps you cultivate a sense of confidence in your own body and your ability 
to give birth. Of course, each woman should consult her physician about her 
own needs just to be certain she doesn’t have any high-risk conditions that 
may require special precautions.
We think that the best way to take full advantage of Yoga is to start your 
practice well before you’re pregnant, or at least as soon as you receive the 
good news. Your Yoga practice can build a strong, healthy body and a stable 
mind, not only helping you conceive a child (by making you fit and relaxed) 
but also supporting you during the pregnancy, at birth, and afterwards. Many 
of our students continue their Yoga practice during their entire pregnancies, 
using the conservative principles that we outline in this book.

224
Part III: Creative Yoga 
 
We don’t recommend starting any new fitness regime, Hatha Yoga included, in 
the middle of a pregnancy. Conscious yogic relaxation and meditation, on the 
other hand, are right at any stage of your pregnancy, and may be helpful tools 
for labor as well. Your body, mind, and baby will be grateful to you!
Enjoying Yoga support as you —
and the baby — grow
Pregnancy entails major physiological and psychological changes. Apart from 
modifying your shape and weight, it also alters your body chemistry. Thus, 
you may experience a range of discomforts as well as the welcome feelings of 
anticipation, excitement, and joy.
Yoga can make a major difference in your pregnancy experience. The 
increased self-awareness that Yoga brings is very helpful during this special 
time when your body is continually undergoing change. Yogic practice 
provides the many benefits during that special time in your — and your 
baby’s — life. Yoga
 
✓ Relaxes your whole body
 
✓ Helps with back problems
 
✓ Relieves nausea
 
✓ Reduces swelling and leg cramps
 
✓ Improves mood
 
✓ Provides focusing and breathing techniques for labor
 
✓ Provides a sense of community and social support through prenatal and 
postnatal Yoga classes
Womb with a (yogic) view
One of the unsung benefits of Yoga may be 
conceiving a baby when stress is the root cause 
of infertility. One memorable example of this 
idea is my (Larry’s) students Dave and Adrian 
Lopez. Immersed in busy, demanding careers, 
they gave up Yoga. When they later decided to 
start a family, they tried unsuccessfully for three 
years to conceive despite repeated attempts 
and the best medical methods available 
to them. Their physician finally suggested that 
perhaps their fertility problems were stress 
related and that they practice Yoga together — 
which they did. Sounds hard to believe, but after 
30 days of practice, which included my weekly 
class and general conditioning DVD (flip to the 
appendix), Adrian became pregnant. She con-
tinued her Yoga practice until her eighth month 
and later gave birth to a big, beautiful baby boy.

225
 Chapter 16:  It’s Never Too Soon: Pre- and Postnatal Yoga
 
When seeking out prenatal Yoga classes, talk to the teacher beforehand. 
Ask about her training and experience and assure yourself that she’s 
knowledgeable about modifications that would be safe and helpful during 
pregnancy.
Exercising caution during pregnancy
Because pregnancy is a time when your actions directly and immediately 
affect you and your developing baby, we recommend that you keep the 
following cautions in mind as you exercise:
 
✓ Always do a little less than you’re used to doing, and never hold your 
breath.
 
✓ Stay away from extremes in all the postures, especially deep forward or 
back bends. Don’t strain.
 
✓ Avoid lying on your stomach for any postures.
 
✓ Steer clear of sit-ups and postures that put pressure on the uterus.
 
✓ Skip the postures that solely focus on tightening the abs; rather, work on 
strengthening your core in the context of more gentle postures.
 
✓ When a posture calls for a twist, twist from the shoulders and not the 
belly to avoid compressing the internal organs.
 
✓ Avoid inverted postures other than putting your feet up on the wall or a 
chair.
 
✓ Pass up breathing exercises that are jarring, such as the shining skull 
(kapalabhati) or breath of fire (bhastrika).
 
✓ Don’t jump or move quickly in and out of postures.
 
✓ Be careful not to overstretch, which you can easily do in pregnancy 
because of increased hormone levels that cause your joints to become 
very limber.
 
ACOG recommends that a pregnant woman avoid lying on her back during 
exercise — and that includes Yoga.
Perfect Pregnancy Postures
Practicing Yoga during pregnancy calls for the same consideration as 
putting together a yogic plan to manage back problems — no single posture 
or routine works the same way for everyone. Plus, what feels right during 
one trimester may not be appropriate during the next. In general, postures 
that allow you to gently increase flexibility in your hips should be useful as 

226
Part III: Creative Yoga 
you prepare for giving birth, and a number of postures achieve that safely. 
We recommend you seek out a qualified Yoga teacher to guide you in either a 
prenatal Yoga class or one-on-one instruction.
In the following sections, we describe three of the most recommended 
and useful Yoga postures for you to use any time during pregnancy and 
postpartum. We also describe a safe 15-to-20 minute Yoga routine that helps 
relieve discomforts and prepare your body for childbirth.
Side-lying posture
Use the side-lying posture as an alternative to the corpse posture (shavasana) 
in your practice. You may also want to use the posture on its own to relieve 
feelings of general fatigue or nausea during pregnancy, labor, and the 
postpartum period, or as a good position for nursing. You need four or five 
blankets or three large pillows.
 
1. Lie on your side on a comfortable surface.
 
2. Place one of the pillows or blankets under your head and the other 
just in front of you on the floor between the top of your thighs and the 
bottom of your chest.
 
 Hang your top arm over the pillow in front of you.
 
3. Bend your knees and place two blankets between your feet and your 
knees (see Figure 16-1).
 
Figure 16-1: 
Side-lying 
posture.
 
Stay and breathe naturally for as long as you feel comfortable. Repeat as 
often as you need to.

227
 Chapter 16:  It’s Never Too Soon: Pre- and Postnatal Yoga
The cat and cow
This posture, a variation of the cat (chakravakasana), extends the lower back 
and helps relieve symptoms of general back pain caused by pregnancy.
 
Don’t exaggerate or force your lower back down in Step 4. Don’t practice this 
pose if you experience any negative symptoms.
 
1. Starting on your hands and knees, look straight ahead.
 
2. Place your knees at hip width and your hands below your shoulders.
 
 Straighten your elbows, but don’t lock them.
 
3. As you exhale, arch your back like a cat.
 
 Turn your head down and look at the floor (see Figure 16-2a).
 
4. As you inhale, slowly look up toward the ceiling and drop your lower 
back, so that the shape of your back resembles that of a cow, as shown 
in Figure 16-2b.
 
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 six to eight times.

The cobbler’s posture: Badda konasana
The cobbler’s posture helps you prepare for delivery by opening your groin 
and hips. It also improves alignment and provides a sitting posture for 
advanced breathing (remember — no holding your breath) and meditation 
techniques.
 
1. Sit on the floor with your legs straight out in front of you.
 
 Place your hands palms down at your sides with your fingers forward.
 
2. Shake your legs out in front of you a few times.

3. Bend your knees outward and slide the soles of your feet towards 
each other until they touch.
 
 Hold the sides of your feet and lift gently up from the chest (see 
Figure 16-3).

Sit in the posture for 30 seconds to a minute; as you progress, you can 
gradually increase to 3 to 5 minutes.
 
If your knees aren’t close to the floor you can sit on blankets or place the 
blankets under your knees.
A safe, quick prenatal routine
The short routine in this section includes postures that are safe throughout 
pregnancy and focuses on the areas of the body that you want to strengthen 
as you prepare your body for giving birth. Chapter 7 gives you more informa-
tion on these postures.
Mountain posture: Tadasana
One of the benefits of the mountain posture during pregnancy is that it 
directs your attention to your posture during this period when your weight 
and balance have gradually but steadily changed.
After you find your center of balance, begin the process of making a mental 
shift (which we discuss in Chapter 14), using the breathing style of your 
choice from Chapter 5. Stay in mountain posture (as shown in Figure 16-4) 
for 6 to 8 breaths

Warrior I: Vira bhadrasana I
As its name may suggest, warrior I strengthens the legs and improves 
stamina and balance. It’s especially beneficial during pregnancy because it 
stretches your hips and helps with tension in your neck and swelling in your 
fingers.
Move in and out of the posture 3 to 4 times and then stay for 6 to 8 breaths 
on each side. Figure 16-5 illustrates.

Another variation in the warrior family, this powerful posture opens your 
hips as it builds stamina and strengthens your arms. Move in and out of the

Figure 16-6.

Standing spread-legged forward bend: Prasarita pada uttanasana
This modified forward bend improves circulation in the head and lengthens 
the spine, hamstrings, and adductor muscles on the inside of the thighs. Just 
hang in this posture (shown in Figure 16-7) for 6 to 8 breaths.
 
You can also try this standing posture with your hips at a wall or door.

Triangle posture: Utthita trikonasana
The triangle posture stretches the sides of the spine, the back of the legs, and 
the hips while it opens the chest. Move in and out of the posture 3 to 4 times 
and then stay for 6 to 8 breaths on each side. Figure 16-8 gives you a visual.

Supported chair squatting posture: Modified ardha utkatasana
The supported chair builds overall stamina while it strengthens your back, 
legs, shoulders, and arms. Move in and out of the posture 3 to 4 times and 
then stay for 6 to 8 breaths.
 
Use an actual chair as illustrated in Figure 16-9 unless you feel comfortable 
without it. Use a wide stance to maintain your center of balance.

Cobbler’s posture
This posture (flip to “The cobbler’s posture” and Figure 16-3 earlier in this 
chapter) is a wonderfully relaxing way to end this short routine. Use an 
advanced breathing technique from Chapter 5, such as alternate nostril 
breathing, that doesn’t require breath retention, and/or a meditation tech-
nique from Chapter 21.
Continuing Yogic Exercise after 
Pregnancy (Postpartum)
Many traditional cultures honor a period of rest for the newly delivered 
mother to give her time to recover from childbirth and bond with her newborn. 
This break typically lasts about four to six weeks; in Spanish, it’s known as la 
cuarentena, or “the 40-day quarantine.” Not surprisingly, physicians generally 
recommend that new mothers wait about six weeks before resuming their 
usual exercise routines, and a couple of weeks longer if they had a Caesarean 
section.
 
When you return to your Yoga mat, avoid all inverted postures for at least six 
weeks postpartum because of uterine blood flow (called lochia). Also, be 
careful with sit-ups because the groin area is fragile from its recent stretch. A 
good way to get started is with short walks and the side-lying corpse posture 
(see “Side-lying posture” and Figure 16-1 earlier in the chapter). All women 
have postnatal bleeding for a few weeks after pregnancy. Watch your flow and 
slow down your Yoga practice a little if the bleeding becomes heavier or turns 
bright red. If in doubt, consult your physician.
Use your Yoga tools to ease your labor — and have 
a healthier child
In their pure and hybrid forms, all the various 
methods of childbirth preparation — Lamaze, 
The Bradley Method, Birthing from Within, 
Birthworks, and Hypnobirthing — draw upon 
techniques that are integral to Yoga. In its own 
way, each method teaches the laboring woman 
to focus on her breath, breathe into a focal 
point, and/or utilize relaxation and meditation 
techniques. Your Yoga practice can help you 
more effectively utilize whichever method of 
childbirth preparation you choose. Why is this 
connection important when the pain of child-
birth can be controlled pharmacologically? 
Because babies born through nonmedicated 
births are better able to breastfeed, and breast-
fed babies are healthier, as are their mothers. 
You and your baby may continue to reap the 
benefits of your prenatal Yoga practice through 
your lifetimes.

233
 Chapter 16:  It’s Never Too Soon: Pre- and Postnatal Yoga
If you can, seek out a postpartum class with other new mothers. A skilled and 
experienced Yoga teacher can focus on those areas of your body that are 
likely to need extra attention during this transitional period — neck, shoulders, 
and upper back from the stress of carrying your baby and leaning over to 
attend to him or her; gentle belly toners to help you regain your pre-pregnancy 
profile; and so on. And don’t underestimate the value of connecting with 
other new mothers. Few new mothers are fully prepared for the feelings of 
isolation and lack of control over their daily lives that are so common in the 
early postpartum period, especially among women who are used to being in 
the world and getting things done. The company of other new mothers who 
are feeling similar things is often comforting and grounding.
Expect your life to change radically after the baby is born. Your Yoga 
practice will seem like an oasis, even if your practice sessions are short, as 
you handle the joyful but exhausting responsibilities of caring for your new 
baby. Don’t feel guilty about making and taking time for yourself. You need 
to recharge. Your hormone levels may make you feel emotional and a little 
unstable, and your Yoga practice can help you find balance. Final relaxation 
after your postures helps you feel more rested even though the enjoyment of 
a full night’s sleep may be but a sweet and distant memory.
Your child took nine months to grow inside your body, so give yourself nine 
months to get back into shape. Set your clock to “mommy time” and enjoy 
the ride.

Yoga for Kids and Teens
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding how to make Yoga fun and safe for kids
▶ Trying some kid-friendly poses
▶ Easing the stress of adolescence with Yoga
▶ Checking out challenging Yoga routines perfect for teens and young adults
Young people have a natural affinity for Yoga. You can introduce even 
the youngest children to Yoga through play. As the names of common 
Yoga postures reveal, the postures were inspired by animals — the cat, the 
cow, the dog, the bear, and so on. The focused coordination of movement 
and breath that makes these movements Yoga and not just physical exercise 
easily lends itself to child’s play. When combined with play — for example, 
imitation of animals sounds, a magic box of plush animal toys, balls of 
various sizes — voilà! You have the beginnings of kid-friendly Yoga.
For the “young and restless,” also known as teens, Yoga offers tools to 
cultivate health in body, mind, and spirit. It provides a noncompetitive way 
for young people to develop strength and confidence, and manage stress — 
the plague of the times.
Classroom teachers are catching on to how Yoga can help their students 
gather up their boundless energy and focus on their academic tasks. Parents 
and Yoga teachers alike are finding that Yoga can also play a therapeutic role 
for children with challenges such as autism and ADHD.
In this chapter, we give pointers, sample postures, and kid-friendly ways for 
parents to introduce Yoga to their children. Teachers reading this book can 
find information here to whet their appetites for incorporating Yoga into 
their classrooms (resources are included in the appendix). Teens and adults 
with energy to spare also get a guide to a classical routine that challenges the 
body while focusing the mind.

Kid Stuff: Making Yoga Fun 
for Youngsters
The sense of calm, focus, and balance that draws adults to the practice of 
Yoga is also available to children, even those as young as three, as long as 
you introduce them to it in a playful, child-friendly fashion. When guided 
with a developmentally appropriate approach, preschoolers and the primary 
school set alike can reap Yoga’s numerous benefits, such as improved 
concentration skills, an ability to calm and center themselves, and greater 
self-esteem and self-confidence. In many ways, young children are naturals 
for Yoga because they can participate without the physical and mental 
tightness that adults have acquired. Afi Kobari, creator of the Yogamama 
program in Los Angeles, describes a palpable energy and joy in her young 
students when she guides them through postures with a playful approach. 
The following sections give you some tips on engaging your child in Yoga, as 
well as several poses to try.
Engaging the imagination: Approaching 
poses in a child-friendly way
Child’s play, when slowed down and joined with consciousness, can provide 
a platform for kid-friendly Yoga practice. Yoga postures (originally derived 
from and often named for animals) and concepts lend themselves to play in a 
variety of ways:
 
✓ Try having your child vocalize a posture’s animal’s call to draw 
attention to the breath.
 
✓ Let your child pick from selection of animal cards and then strike the 
pose of the chosen animal.
 
✓ Incorporate balance into any number of children’s games that involve 
running and stopping at a specified moment by directing your child to 
be still and balance on one leg after stopping.
 
✓ Adding a children’s Yoga book or idea with a story also helps to keep 
kids focused and share more philosophy with them in addition to asana.
 
✓ Add rolling a ball with one hand while the child’s other hand is engaged 
in a seated posture to encourage right/left brain development.

237
 Chapter 17: Yoga for Kids and Teens
 
Be flexible when introducing your child to Yoga. Keep the following pointers in 
mind:
 
✓ Short, happy practice sessions that your child wants to come back to 
are better than a longer session that loses her attention.
 
✓ Be willing to adjust the Yoga session to your child’s mood. A tired child 
may enjoy sitting poses. Cooling breathing exercises help a cranky child 
calm down. On a rainy day, active poses bring physical release of pent 
up energy.
Yoga postures kids will love
 
Children should skip the headstand and shoulder stand. Although their bodies 
are flexible, they lack the strength and stability to do those postures safely.
We designed the postures in the following sections to be kid-friendly and 
wrote the accompanying text to be parent-friendly as you guide your child. 
Bring balance to children with special needs
According to the Mayo Clinic, growing evi-
dence suggests that Yoga may help alleviate 
symptoms of ADHD. On its physical level, Yoga 
encourages focus on breath before, during, and 
between postures, physical exertion through 
the asanas, and a focused winding down 
period afterwards, all of which can help calm 
your hyperactive tot. Yoga helps hyperactive 
children get in touch with their bodies in a 
relaxed and noncompetitive way, and its cumu-
lative effects for your little yogi or yogini may 
result in improvements in their capacity for 
schoolwork and creative play. Seek out a Yoga 
teacher who can create a strong bond with 
your child to gain his trust and attention.
Yoga can also help children with autism gain 
new motor, communication, and social skills 
and thus enjoy an overall improvement in their 
quality of life. Structure and repetition are key 
for Yoga sessions for a child with autism. By 
gradually adding subtle modifications to the 
postures, one at a time, Yoga can help your child 
practice becoming comfortable with change. 
Over time, your little yogi or yogini develops a 
greater capacity to handle the stress that so 
often accompanies autism, along with greater 
body awareness and concentration.
The right Yoga teacher for your child with 
autism is someone who is respectful of her 
abilities as well as her challenges. This 
special teacher must be willing to meet your 
child where she is and gain her trust.

Part III: Creative Yoga 
You can find more detail about each of the postures in other chapters 
throughout the book, as we note in each section; when done in sequence, 
this set of postures forms a well-balanced routine. In addition to providing 
you with instructions to give your child as he gets into the posture, the 
sections suggest sounds he can make while in the pose. The sounds serve a 
dual purpose: They inspire your child’s imagination while he’s holding the 
pose (keeping him engaged) and also guide him to breathe rather than hold 
his breath.
Note: In these sections, we sometimes refer to yummy poses. The term yummy 
pose is just a kid-friendly description of a resting pose, where you allow your 
body and mind to release. It was coined by Afi Kobari, a specialist in Yoga for 
children.
 
Children have short attention spans. You know your child best, so do only as 
many postures as he has attention for. In time, he’ll be able to do more.
 
Find a special spot to practice Yoga with your child. Is there somewhere in 
your house or apartment where he gravitates to for play? That may be the per-
fect place to begin to share your love of Yoga.
The mountain posture
Figure 17-1 gives you and your child a visual of this kiddie posture; flip to 
Chapter 7 for more info on the adult version. Give your child the following 
instructions:
 
1. Stand tall like a mountain.
 
2. Breathe through your nose and imagine you’re in a very, very quiet 
place.

 Chapter 17: Yoga for Kids and Teens
Warrior I
See the preceding section for instructions to help get your child into mountain 
posture. Figure 17-2 and Chapter 7 give you more guidance on warrior I.
 
If your child’s knee bends so much that you see it extending farther than the 
ankle, tell him to bend the knee a little bit less. The following instructions can 
lead your little yogi to warrior I success:
 
1. Start in the mountain posture and take a big step forward with 
one leg.
 
2. Bend your front knee and raise your arms overhead by your ears.
 
3. Feel how powerful and strong you are in this posture; next time, as 
you bend your knee and raise your arms, say “Yes! I Can!”
 
4. Keeping your knee bent and your arms raised, stay in this position 
and really feel like a warrior.
 
5. Try the same movements on the other side.
 
Figure 17-2: 
Warrior I 
for kids.
 
How long should your child hold a posture?
Younger children may only want to stay for a 
few seconds before they’re ready to move. 
Older children can stay longer. Adults usually 
hold a position for six breaths after first having 
moved in and out of it a few times. Ask your 
child to hold the position only as long as you 
feel she will be comfortable. If she starts to get 
squirmy, have her come out of the position.

Bear posture
Check out Figure 17-3 and the following instructions to direct your child into 
bear posture.
 
1. Start in the mountain posture and then bend forward and hang down.
 
2. Staying bent, walk around, dragging your arms and hands as you 
growl, and imagine you’re a bear.

Cat and cow
The following directions help you walk your child through cat and cow; kids 
usually have a lot fun with this sequence, especially when you do it with 
them.
 
1. Get down on your hands and knees as if you’re going to crawl, but 
stay in one place.
 
2. Make your back round so you can look down and back at your legs.
 
 Figure 17-4a illustrates this step.
 
3. Imagine you’re a cat and make the sound of a cat: meow.
 
4. Move your back so that your belly goes down towards the floor, your 
chest goes up, and you look ahead.
 
 Show your child Figure 17-4b if he has trouble visualizing this step.
 
5. Imagine you’re a cow and make the sound of a cow: mooo, mooo.

Ah, shavasana, the yummy part
No matter how short your child’s Yoga session, 
be sure to include a period of final relaxation, or 
shavasana. Shavasana allows a child to relax 
her body without forcing it. It can be as simple 
as counting five breaths. This rest is especially 
helpful for those children who are never ready 
for bedtime for fear they may miss something — 
sound like a little one you know? Flip to Chapter 4

Easing the Transition into Adulthood: 
Yoga for Teens
Yoga practice in the teenage years is so much more than an exercise program. 
Yes, it provides an energy outlet and a way to build muscle and flexibility — 
both important in their own right. But Yoga practice also provides you with 
an entry point for a healthful and balanced perspective on life and 
themselves that can serve for a lifetime. The following sections describe 
some benefits Yoga can offer teens.

 Chapter 17: Yoga for Kids and Teens
The antidote to stress in 
your overscheduled life
Maybe you’re vying for a place on the team or a high class ranking, juggling 
a part-time job, or caring for younger siblings while being a full-time student. 
More likely than not, your time and energy are stretched to the max.
And your shifting hormonal levels may leave you feeling like a different 
person from day to day, hour to hour, and even minute to minute.
Integrating Yoga into the classroom
The lessons of Yoga aren’t confined to the Yoga 
mat or the body. The skills and understanding 
acquired through Yoga practice help children 
of all ages, including teens, approach life in 
a more grounded, centered, and emotionally 
intelligent way. When presented as an explora-
tion, traditional Yoga themes such as the prac-
tice of ahimsa, or non-harming (see Chapter 20), 
can be translated into simple, practical distinc-
tions, such as the difference between force and 
finesse. Take the simple exercise of untying a 
knot: By using finesse rather than force, a child 
learns through his own experience which is the 
better way. This awareness applied to Yoga 
poses and balance allows a child to recognize 
which feels best in his own body; applied to per-
sonal relationships, it illustrates the better way 
to get along with the people in his life.
You don’t need to be a Yoga teacher to bring 
this often-neglected aspect of learning into the 
classroom. Classroom teachers can learn to 
lead children through basic poses and routines 
to enhance their ability to learn throughout the 
day — for instance, morning sun salutations 
(see Chapter 14) to energize and focus their 
energy; balancing poses (see Chapter 9) after 
recess to regroup for academics; alternate nos-
tril breathing (see Chapter 5) in a comfortable 
seated pose (see Chapter 7) or a simple forward 
bend (see Chapter 12) to help calm the mind as 
a prelude to creative writing. The list goes on. 
To date, over 1,000 schools have integrated 
Yoga techniques into their curricula through the 
training and materials available through Yoga 
Playgrounds and Yoga Ed, both developed by 
Leah Kalish.

250
Part III: Creative Yoga 
Yoga can be an oasis in a vast desert of stress. Yoga, a union of mind and 
body, can make weathering the demands of daily life easier. With regular 
practice, you may find that you have a greater ability to think for yourself 
and trust yourself — important at a time of life when peer pressure can feel 
overwhelming and poor judgment and bad decisions can impact your health, 
well-being, and your future.
 
Headstands, shoulder stands, and the lotus position may look like the popular 
idea of Yoga, but in fact they can be dangerous. Young people who are still 
growing don’t yet have the necessary musculature and stability to tackle these 
postures safely, so stay away from them for the time being.
Fit for life, and so much more
Perhaps the most important benefit Yoga can offer you as a teen is the 
opportunity to develop a lifelong friendship with your body. When you 
develop a Yoga practice, first under the guidance of a skilled and nurturing 
teacher and then later on your own, you tune in to your body, pay attention 
to what’s is happening, and respond appropriately — not unlike the good 
energy you put into your friendships with your best buddies. A regular Yoga 
practice can help you develop the focus, concentration, and discipline you 
need to study well and pursue your dreams. And when you’re barefooted on 
your mat in the practice studio, you’re free from the pecking order of your 
school campus. Yoga helps you become self confident and courageous, 
without competing. How good is that?
Of course, Yoga is also a great way to become and stay fit. Both the USDA and 
Health Canada rank having an adequate level of physical activity as a high 
health priority. The revised USDA Food Pyramid (www.mypyramid.gov) 
actually includes it as part of a balanced diet.
As a form of physical fitness, Yoga is an attractive package:
 
✓ It’s economical. You already have this book, so you can begin practicing 
right away without anything else.
 
✓ You don’t need a gym or a playing field. You just need enough floor 
space to practice safely. If you practice at home, try to find a private 
space. If your space is at a premium, consider following the lead of a 
highly-respected Yoga teacher who’s been known to practice “bathroom 
Yoga” when no other private space was available. Building codes require 
even the smallest bathrooms to have a certain amount of floor space. 
Check it out. Yours may just be long enough for a mat.

Yoga Routines for the 
Young and Restless
 
The routines in this section have been specifically designed for teens. When 
done carefully, they also work for men and women well into their 30s, but 
we don’t recommend them for the typical middle-aged person over 40. A lot 
of what group Yoga classes across America (especially in health clubs) offer 
today was originally designed for lightweight teenage boys in India whose 
lifestyles involved a lot of squatting. Middle-aged beginners often jump into 
that kind of Yoga in a competitive way and end up with injuries to show for it 
because it’s just not built for them (or they for it).
Most professional athletes are usually at their highest physical prowess from 
their teens to early 30s. Then the body starts to change, and so should the 
training program to prevent injuries. I (Larry) call the first stage “Yoga for the 
Young and Restless.” Many of the popular styles of Yoga, such as Ashtanga 
Yoga, some components of Iyengar Yoga, and modern flow Yoga, were 
inspired by the teachings of the late Sri T. Krishnamacharya of Southern India 
earlier in his life, and were originally intended for younger practitioners. The 
unpublished routines in this section were passed down to me (Larry) by Sri 
T. Krishnamacharya’s son (and my teacher) T.K.V. Desikachar.
 
These routines are meant to be challenging. However, always keep in mind 
Yoga’s fundamental principle: “Do no harm.” Trust your inner teacher. If your 
body says it’s time to rest, rest (even if others are still in their poses). Trusting 
yourself in this way is an important step towards becoming a balanced adult.
Can Yoga help you maintain a healthy weight?
According to Robert M. Sapolsky’s Why Zebras 
Don’t Get Ulcers (Henry Holt and Company), 
modern garden variety stressors can lead to 
overeating, and in particular, choosing the 
wrong kinds of food to overeat. Stress floods 
your body with hormones that affect your 
appetite. If the stress is intense but short-
lived, most people usually experience a loss of 
appetite — the way you feel when you’re 
too nervous to eat. But when you experience 
frequent on-and-off stress throughout the 
course of the day, day in and day out, the 
hormonal levels in the body increase 
appetite — and not for the healthy stuff. What 
helps? Regular exercise that you look forward 
to doing, meditation, and cultivating a self-
accepting, non-perfectionist approach to life 
are a few things that have been shown to help. 
How handy to be able to find all of that in Yoga.

Standing routine
As you get ready to begin your routine, remember that Yoga is a body, 
breath, and mind discipline. With the exception of the jumps, move slowly 
and stay in the moment.
Before you begin, here are some general tips and instructions to keep in 
mind:
 
✓ Choose either focus or chest-to-belly breathing from Chapter 5.
 
✓ Stay and breathe in each posture for 8 to 10 breaths.
 
✓ Do the whole routine twice on both sides.
 
✓ Refer to Chapter 7 for detailed instruction on all the postures in this 
routine (though note that some postures here are variations on 
Chapter 7’s postures).
 
✓ This routine should take about 15 to 20 minutes.
When you’re ready, follow these steps to complete the standing routine:
 
1. Start in the mountain posture (see Figure 17-16a).
 
 Initiate the Yoga breathing style of your choice from the list earlier in 
this section.
 
2. As you exhale, jump or step out into a wide stance with your arms in a 
T parallel to the floor as shown in Figure 17-16b.
 
3. As you inhale, raise your arms from the sides up and overhead as you 
rotate your feet and torso to the right as Figure 17-16c illustrates.
 
4. As you exhale, sink into warrior I position with your right knee bent 
in a 90-degree angle like in Figure 17-16d).
 
5. As you inhale, rotate your shoulders to the left and drop your arms 
into a T with your palms down for the warrior II position.
 
 Open your back (left) hip to the left as far as it can go and tuck your tail 
under comfortably. Figure 17-16e gives you a visual.
 
6. As you exhale, rotate your shoulders to the right and reach forward 
with your left arm and back with your right arm so that they’re parallel 
to the floor (as in Figure 17-16f) for the reverse triangle variation I.
 
7. Inhale and then, as you exhale, drop your left hand down to the floor 
and bring your right arm straight up for the reverse triangle variation 
II, keeping your right leg bent and rotating your head up to the right 
as shown insee Figure 17-16g.
 
 If your neck gets tired, turn your head down.
 
8. As you exhale, roll down with your arms, trunk, and head; turn your 
feet forward and parallel and then hang down the middle, holding 

253

your elbows for the standing spread-legged forward bend shown in 
Figure 17-16h.
 
9. Roll your body up and then jump or step back into the mountain 
posture in Step 1.
 
10. Repeat Steps 1 through 9 on the left side.

Floor Routine
Some people call this routine the Lifetime Sequence because getting into 
wide-legged seated forward bend postures takes a lifetime if you aren’t 
naturally flexible in the hips. The beauty of Yoga is that if you don’t achieve 
your goal in this lifetime, you can get there in the next.
Before you begin, here are some tips to keep in mind:
 
✓ Choose focus or chest-to-belly breathing from Chapter 5.
 
✓ Stay in each posture (including each time you raise your arms) for 6 to 8 
breaths.
 
✓ Do the whole sequence twice.
 
✓ This routine should take 20 to 25 minutes.
 
✓ Feel free to soften your knees in all of the forward bends.
 
✓ Challenge yourself, but don’t strain yourself.
 
This routine isn’t recommended for people with lower back problems 
aggravated by rounding.
When you’re ready, follow these steps to complete the floor routine:
 
1. Start with your arms in the air and a straight back as in Figure 17-17a.
 
2. As you exhale, bend forward and down to the seated forward bend 
pose shown in Figure 17-17b.
 
3. As you inhale, raise your trunk and arms up to a straight back and 
separate your legs wide like in Figure 17-17c.
 
4. As you exhale, bend forward and down to a spread-legged forward

If you have back problems lifting up from the forward bends in this routine, 
try the “Roll Up”: Keep your chin down on your chest and roll up, stacking the 
vertebrae one at a time, with your arms hanging at your sides. When you’re 
fully upright, bring the arms up and overhead from the front and look forward.

It’s Never Too Late: Yoga for 
Midlifers and Older Adults
In This Chapter
▶ Going into Prime of Life Yoga with the proper attitude
▶ Discovering Yoga benefits and routines for midlife
▶ Taking older practitioners’ needs into consideration
I
f you’re on the senior side of the life curve and considering taking up 
Yoga, you’re not alone. A 2008 Yoga Journal study reported that of the 
almost 16 million Americans who practice Yoga, almost 3 million are 55 or 
older.
Yoga can help practitioners of every age improve their health and well-being. 
The Yoga toolbox includes innumerable postures that, depending on how 
you modify them, can offer the appropriate level of challenge to each and 
every yogi and yogini regardless of age or ability. Remember, the process 
and the practice are what are important, not the final form of the postures. 
One advantage that more mature practitioners of Yoga have over its more 
youthful adherents is greater patience to be still for breathing exercises and 
meditation, both of which become more important relative to the postures as 
you age.
This chapter discusses and presents safe Yoga routines for people in their 
middle-aged and senior years. The Prime of Life Yoga discussion addresses 
folks who fall within the vast expanse of the middle years — generally 
between 40-something and 70-something.
The “Cherish the Chair” section addresses the needs of folks who are 
generally older than 70; however, these routines may be used and enjoyed 
by people of any age. Yoga is a union of body, breath, and mind, and that the 
best variations of Yoga postures for any individual are those that meet his or 
her own physical, emotional, and lifestyle needs regardless of age.

Reaping the Benefits of Yoga 
Through Midlife and Beyond
Midlife, as the word suggests, refers to the middle of life. It’s not, as some 
people think, The End but rather a new beginning. The following sections 
show you how Yoga helps you navigate the physical and emotional changes 
associated with midlife and allows you to age gracefully, healthfully, and 
actively.
Working through menopause
Menopause signals a major biochemical change in a woman, marked most 
obviously by the disappearance of her monthly flow. Her body’s sexual 
glands go into relative retirement, and she can no longer bear children. 
The hormonal shifts that lead up to the actual menopause may take up to a 
decade. Perimenopause, the term given to the longer process, can bring with 
it a host of undesirable side effects: hot flashes, palpitations, dizzy spells, 
insomnia, vaginal dryness, urinary problems, and irritability. This time of life 
can make women prone to depression, but with an attitude of acceptance 
for the change and the possibilities yet to come, it can actually be a very 
satisfying time of life. That’s where Yoga comes in.
Regular Yoga practice can help alleviate the physiological side effects of 
menopause, especially if you start a few years before its onset, and help you 
cultivate a forgiving, accepting, and positive attitude important for your 
emotional well-being. Inversions (see Chapter 10), which have a profound 
effect on the glands and inner organs and literally and figuratively allow you 
to view things from a new perspective, are especially helpful. For soothing 
rest and whole-person recovery, we particularly recommend that you 
cultivate the corpse posture we describe in Chapter 15. Just give your body a 
chance to rebalance its chemistry.
Not just a “woman thing”: Andropause
Men experience something similar to menopause called andropause. 
Although changes in their sexual glands may lessen their sex drives, men can 
continue to sire children into old age. But when they see their vitality and 
hairline recede a little, men are often thrown into an existential crisis.
Midlife offers a great opportunity to discover life’s possibilities beyond 
sexual reproduction and raising children. Regular Yoga practice can buffer 
the unpleasant physiological side effects of andropause and stabilize the 
emotions that are triggered when you realize you’re no longer quite so 
dashing — unless, of course, you have practiced Yoga all along.

 Chapter 18: It’s Never Too Late: Yoga for Midlifers and Older Adults
Bones of steel
 
With regular exercise, you can prevent the bone loss (osteoporosis) associated 
with midlife and old age. Regular weight-bearing exercises strengthen your 
bones, but stress causes acidity, which leaches the calcium from your bones. 
Many people don’t realize that osteoporosis actually starts in your mid to late 
20s. Therefore, you can’t begin Yoga too early — and it’s never too late to take 
it up! Buns of steel ain’t bad, but bones of steel are the better deal.
Approaching Prime of Life Yoga 
with the Right Mindset
As you age, mobility is the new flexibility. So although you may have been 
able to do the most acrobatic postures in your youth, the important goal 
now is to maintain the mobility to remain fit and active. In the Prime of Life 
approach to Yoga postures, spinal freedom and movement take precedence 
over form. Adjustments to the posture, such as bending the knees a lot if 
necessary, encourage movement of the spine.
The attitude you bring to your practice is critical. The right attitude on the 
mat allows you to practice postures safely and spills over to your life off the 
mat. Here are a few Yoga principles for a safe and fulfilling practice.
 
✓ Challenge yourself but don’t strain yourself.
 
✓ Yoga is a dialogue, not a monologue; keep body, breath, and mind 
linked.
 
✓ Think of your Yoga practice as a meditation in motion.
 
✓ You get no gain with negative pain (pain that does harm).
 
✓ You’re the chairman of the board; you decide when to come out of the 
posture.
 
✓ Let the posture fit you instead of trying to fit yourself into the posture.
User-Friendly Routines for Midlifers
In this section, we present routines for two different skill levels, both of 
which are equally ideal for men and women. (For true beginners with a 
few aches or pains, we recommend starting with the lower back routine in 
Chapter 22.)

260
Part III: Creative Yoga 
 
You can find recommendations for DVDs on Yoga for this age group in the 
appendix.
Prime of Life Yoga routine: Level I
The routine described and illustrated in this section is a nice general-
conditioning routine for midlifers and even younger folks who want to ease 
back into physical activity. This user-friendly sequence strings together a 
series of safe postures that work each side of the body separately, helping to 
achieve greater balance.
You can find detailed instructions for each of these various poses or their 
variations in Chapters 4, 7, 8, and 15. Choose a breathing technique from 
Chapter 5. Hold each posture and its variation for six to eight breaths, with 
the exception of warrior I (described in Steps 2 and 3) and revolved triangle 
variation (Steps 9 and 10). For each of these, move into and out of the postures 
three times and then hold for six to eight breaths. This routine should take 
about 30 to 35 minutes.
 
1. Start in the mountain posture shown in Figure 18-1a.
 
 Initiate the Yoga breathing style of your choice for six to eight breaths 
(see Chapter 5).
 
2. As you exhale, step forward with the right foot about 3 to 31⁄2 feet (or 
the length of one leg).
 
 Your left foot will turn out naturally. (Turn it out more to increase 
stability). Place your hands on the tops of your hips and square the 
front of your pelvis; release your hands and hang your arms (see 
Figure 18-1b).
 
3. As you inhale, raise your arms from the front up and overhead and 
bend your right leg into a right angle for warrior I as Figure 18-1c 
illustrates.
 
4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 three times and then stay in warrior I for six to 
eight breaths.
 
5. As you exhale, bend both arms downward and draw your elbows 
back as you turn your palms up and lift your chest as shown in 
Figure 18-1d; hold this proud warrior posture for six to eight breaths.
 
6. As you inhale, keep your right leg bent; join your palms together in 
front of you and bring them up and overhead as you look up and back 
as in Figure 18-1e.
 
 Stay in the exalted warrior posture for six to eight breaths.
 
7. As you exhale, come down over your bent right leg and place your 
hands on the floor for the standing asymmetrical forward bend as 
Figure 18-1f indicates; stay in the posture for six to eight breaths.

261
 Chapter 18: It’s Never Too Late: Yoga for Midlifers and Older Adults
 
 Work on straightening your right leg based on your flexibility in the 
moment. A soft or bent leg is okay.
 
 If you want to feel the stretch more, square your hips by pulling the 
right hip back and the left hip forward. A more challenging option is to 
rotate the back foot inward, called paralleling the feet.
 
8. As you inhale roll your body up vertebra by vertebra and then step 
your feet together back into the mountain posture from Step 1.
 
9. Repeat Steps 1 through 8 on the left side.
 
10. From the mountain posture, step out with your right foot about 3 to 
31⁄2 feet (or the length of one leg); as you exhale, bend forward from 
the hips, hang down, and place the palms of both hands on the floor 
directly below your shoulders as shown in Figure 18-1g.
 
11. As you inhale, raise your right arm up towards the ceiling and look 
up at your right hand for the reverse triangle posture as Figure 18-1h 
illustrates.
 
12. Repeat Steps 10 and 11 three times and then remain with your right 
arm up for six to eight breaths.
 
 Soften your knees and arms. Turn your head down if your neck gets 
sore. Repeat on your left side.
 
13. As you exhale, hang your torso, head, and arms down, holding your 
bent elbows with opposite-side hands for the standing spread-legged 
forward bend (see Figure 18-1i); stay for six to eight breaths.
 
14. Transition to your hands and knees and slide your right hand forward 
and your left leg back as you exhale, keeping your hand and your 
toes on the floor; as you inhale, raise your right arm and left leg 
to a comfortable height for the balancing cat posture as shown in 
Figure 18-1j.
 
 Stay up for four to eight breaths then and then repeat with opposite 
pairs, lifting your left hand and your right leg.
 
 If you want a bigger challenge in this posture, raise your bottom foot 
just off the floor.
 
15. As you exhale, come back to all fours and fold down into the child’s 
posture variation (with your arms in front of you) in Figure 18-1k; hold 
for six to eight breaths.
 
16. Lie flat on your back with your arms along the sides of your torso, 
your palms up, and your eyes closed for the corpse posture as in 
Figure 18-1l.
 
17. To finish, use belly breathing from Chapter 5 or a relaxation 
technique from Chapter 4 for three to five minutes.

Prime of Life Yoga Routine: Level II
After you master the level I sequence described in the preceding section, 
enjoy the challenge of this section’s level II sequence. It’s a little longer and 
more physically demanding, and like the other routine, brings balance by 
working each side of the body separately. 

263
 Chapter 18: It’s Never Too Late: Yoga for Midlifers and Older Adults
Plan to spend approximately 45 minutes to complete this sequence, which is 
broken into two parts: standing postures and postures on the floor.
For detailed information on the various postures in this section or their 
variations, head to Chapters 4, 7, 8, 11, 12, and 15. Select a breathing 
technique from Chapter 5. Hold each posture and variation for six to eight 
breaths, with the exception of the warrior II posture (Steps 3 and 4), and the 
seated forward bend posture (Steps 12 and 13), both of which you move into 
and out of three times before holding for six to eight breaths.
 
1. Start in the mountain posture illustrated in Figure 18-2a.
 
 Initiate the Yoga breathing style of your choice from Chapter 5 for six to 
eight breaths.
 
2. As you exhale, step out to your right with your right foot about 3 to 31⁄2 
feet (or the length of one leg); turn your right foot out 90 degrees and 
your left foot inward 45 degrees.
 
3. As you inhale, raise your arms out to your sides in a T parallel to the 
line of your shoulders and the floor for the warrior II ready posture as 
Figure 18-2b indicates.
 
4. As you exhale, bend your right knee to a right angle with the floor 
and turn your head to the right as shown in Figure 18-2c; repeat Steps 
3 and 4 three times and then remain in the warrior II posture for six to 
eight breaths.
 
5. As you inhale, raise your right arm and turn your right palm up; as 
you exhale, reach back with your left hand (palm down) and hold the 
outside of your left leg, looking up at your right hand for the reverse 
warrior posture (see Figure 18-2d), and stay for six to eight breaths.
 
6. As you inhale, move back briefly to the warrior II position and then 
bend your right arm, lay your right forearm across the top of your 
right thigh, and extend your left arm over your head in alignment 
with your left ear as illustrated in Figure 18-2e; stay in this extended 
right angle posture for six to eight breaths.
 
7. Repeat Steps 1 through 6 on the left side.
 
8. From your wide stance, roll your body up, turn both feet forward (to the 
right), and hang your arms at your sides; as you exhale, bend forward 
from the hips and hang your torso, head, and arms down, holding your 
bent elbows with opposite-side hands in the standing spread-legged 
forward bend as Figure 18-2f demonstrates for six to eight breaths.
 
9. Return to mountain posture (refer to Figure 18-2a.)
 
10. As you inhale, raise your arms from the front up and overhead; as 
you exhale, bend forward from the hips, raise your left leg back and 
up until your arms, torso, and left leg are all parallel to the floor and 
you’re balancing on your right leg in the warrior III posture. See 
Figure 18-2g for six to eight breaths.

you in the bridge variation with arm raise posture as shown in Figure 
18-3a for six to eight breaths.
 
13. Lie on your abdomen with your left arm forward (palm down) and 
your right arm back at your right side (palm up) and then bend your 
right knee and hold your right foot with your right hand, lifting your 
chest, left arm, and right foot to a comfortable level as you inhale into 
the half bow posture (see Figure 18-3b); stay up for six to eight breaths 
and then repeat with opposite pairs, holding your left foot with your 
left hand and extending your right arm forward.
 
14. Move to your hands and knees with both at hip width; as you exhale, 
sit back on your heels and fold your head and hips down into a 
comfortable position for the child’s posture variation as Figure 18-3c 
illustrates — stay folded for six to eight breaths.

265
 Chapter 18: It’s Never Too Late: Yoga for Midlifers and Older Adults
 
15. Transition to a seated position with your legs stretched out in front 
of you and bring your back up nice and tall, moving your arms 
forward and up alongside your ears as you inhale, as demonstrated in 
Figure 18-3d.
 
16. As you exhale, bend forward from your hips, bringing your hands, chest, 
and head toward the floor as shown in Figure 18-3e; repeat Steps 15 and 
16 three times and then stay down and folded for six to eight breaths.
 
 Soften your legs and arms as needed.
 
 Take extra caution or avoid seated straight-legged forward bends if you 
have back problems that are exacerbated by rounding the back.
 
17. Lie flat on your back with your legs stretched out and your arms 
extended out into a T with your palms up, and as you exhale, bring 
your right leg up and across your torso to the opposite side, slide your 
left arm overhead, and turn your head to the right until you are in the 
Swiss army knife as in Figure 18-3f; stay in the posture for six to eight 
breaths and then repeat with opposite pairs.
 
 Soften your limbs as needed.

Yoga for Older Adults
According to the National Institute on Aging (www.nia.nih.gov), “‘Too 
old’ and ‘too frail’ are not, in and of themselves, reasons to prohibit physical 
activity. In fact, there aren’t very many health reasons to keep older adults 
from becoming more active.” Rather, many chronic conditions are actually 
a result of not exercising. As a form of exercise, Yoga has many benefits that 
are specific to seniors. Improved balance and flexibility reduce the risk for 
(and fear of) injury and increase mobility. Yoga also improves circulation and 
your ability to sleep, and adding even light weights to the postures increases 
bone density and lowers the risk of fracture. Plus, group practice promotes 
social interaction and sense of connectedness.
Seniors interested in Yoga should first check with their physicians. After you 
get the green light, seek out a class that focuses on your age group both for the 
social benefits and to be guided by a teacher who is knowledgeable about adapt-
ing postures to your needs and abilities. Head to Chapter 2 for more on picking 
a teacher and a class. Be sure to mention any physical conditions or concerns 
(such as high blood pressure, hip replacement, osteoporosis, and so on) and 
verify whether your prospective teacher can modify the routines to ensure your 
safety. In a group setting, a skilled teacher offers a range of options so that each 
student can practice at a level appropriate for his or her abilities and limitations.
How old is too old for Yoga?
Shelly Kinney, a Las Vegas-based Yoga thera-
pist, recounts her experience with Ms. L, a 
96-year-old student who was glued to her 
walker. After several months of Yoga practice, 
Ms. L was able to enter and leave the class 
without it. How did this happen? She executed 
warrior and side angle postures from a chair, 
adding light weights over time, and worked 
with balance postures with a ballet bar on one 
side, a chair at the other, and Shelley there for 
support. Slowly but surely, Ms. L built up 
strength, flexibility, and confidence. She’s proof 
that you’re never too old to take up Yoga and 
enjoy its benefits.

Cherish the Chair: Safe Routines 
for Older Adults
You don’t have to practice Yoga on the floor. If getting down to the floor or 
getting up and down is difficult, chair Yoga offers spinal freedom while 
allowing you to remain in your comfort zone. You can improve your 
flexibility, mobility, and balance even while seated, and the following 
routines show you how.
 
You’re in charge of whether or not you do a particular posture. If it doesn’t 
feel right for you, don’t do it. The National Institute of Aging provides a wealth 
of information to help guide you on what may be safe for you and what you 
should avoid. We also list books addressing the needs of older practitioners in 
the appendix, and your Yoga teacher may suggest other books or articles as 
well. Educate yourself, and enjoy the benefits of breath and movement.
Cherish the chair routine: Level I
The postures in this seated Yoga routine give you the same main benefits 
of a regular Yoga class, including stress reduction, improved circulation, 
better concentration and an overall sense of well-being. This routine should 
take about 15 to 20 minutes. Choose one of the Yoga breathing techniques in 
Chapter 5 and use it for this entire routine. Follow the instructions for breath 
and movement and have fun!
 
Place blankets or a block under your feet if they don’t sit flat on the floor in 
any of the chair postures.

Chapter 19
Prop Art: The Why and 
How of Simple Props
In This Chapter
▶ Weighing the pros and cons of using props
▶ Relying on props you probably already own
▶ Investing in store-bought props for Yoga practice
T
he mainstay for any Yoga practice is, of course, the body-mind itself. 
However, props — physical means of support — may enhance your Yoga 
experience, especially if you’re a beginner.
Traditionally, yogis and yoginis have relied on just a few basic props for 
their postural, breathing, and meditation practice — a bundle of grass or a 
tiger skin to sit on, a T-shaped arm rest (called hamsa danda) for prolonged 
meditation, and a neti pot, which looks like an undersized pitcher, for cleans-
ing the nasal cavities with lukewarm (often salted) water prior to practicing 
breath control. Unfortunately, most Westerners’ lifestyles and diets produce 
neither a naturally balanced mind nor a well-trained body, so a lot of these 
folks (especially beginners) often need to incorporate props into their Yoga 
to help encourage proper alignment.
That said, your own body is often all the prop you need. For example, the 
principle of Forgiving Limbs (which we cover in Chapter 3), in which you bend 
your knees and elbows, allows you to enjoy the function and benefits of a given 
posture even if your body isn’t flexible enough to assume the posture’s classic 
(traditionally taught) form. Many may benefit from the use of simple aids in 
addition to their bent limbs, so we discuss some of these external props in this 
chapter. When you use them intelligently, props can help you practice with 
pleasure in spite of tight hamstrings, stiff hips, and an inflexible back.
Of course, using props has both pros and cons, but this chapter gives you 
enough information to make your own decisions about what you want to 
include in your Yoga practice; throughout the book, we point out where you 
may benefit from using a prop in a posture and show you how to use it.

280
Part III: Creative Yoga 
Examining the Pros and Cons of Props
As with anything in life, doing Yoga with props has its upsides and down-
sides. The following sections list some of the benefits and disadvantages of 
using props, but you have to determine on your own how props can help 
support your Yoga practice.
Exploring the advantages of props
One of the great things about using props in your Yoga practice is that you 
can use them as extensively as you want or not at all. A folded blanket under 
your hips can make all the difference when you want to sit cross-legged for 
more than a couple of minutes, and a wall can be a welcome support for your 
legs or back while you’re doing particular postures. Here are a few more prop 
plusses:
 
✓ They give you the added advantage of leverage in many postures.
 
✓ They help to improve your alignment, balance, and stability.
 
✓ Props like the Body Slant (which we discuss later in the chapter) pro-
vide the benefits of a classic inversion such as a headstand without com-
pressing your neck.
 
✓ They allow you to participate more fully in a group class. With safe 
tools, you can perform some postures that would otherwise be inacces-
sible to you instead of hanging out in easier or resting postures until the 
group comes back to your level.
 
✓ They are, for the most part, relatively inexpensive and usually last for a 
long time.
Looking at props’ drawbacks
Although Yoga props have their benefits, they do have some downsides 
as well. Keep the following in mind as you evaluate whether a prop is right 
for you:
 
✓ Given the advantage of a prop, some people go too far in a posture and 
injure themselves. Rather than try to look like a magazine-cover or Yoga-
calendar model, listen to your own body’s needs.
 
✓ You have to carry some props around with you when you go to a class.
 
✓ You can become too dependent on props, which inhibits your progress.

281
 Chapter 19: Prop Art: The Why and How of Simple Props
 
✓ Some props take time to set up and take down and can break the flow of 
a class.
 
✓ Some props are expensive.
Going Prop Hunting at Home
The human species prides itself on its use of tools, and Yoga’s growing popu-
larity in the Western world has spawned an industry of Yoga-related props — 
gear that can be complicated and costly. But useful props can be as simple as 
items lying around your house. Usually, a couple of blankets, a strap, a chair, 
or a wall for support is all that you need.
Yoga has always favored an experimental approach, and we suggest that you 
proceed in the same way. Find out for yourself what works for you and what 
doesn’t. Instead of giving up on a challenging posture, experiment with one 
or the other recommended prop. For instance, if you can’t sit comfortably 
with your legs folded in the tailor’s seat (sukhasana), try placing a folded 
blanket or firm pillow under your hips. The following sections explain how 
common household finds can prop up your Yoga session.
Working with a wall
Walls are a great prop — they’re everywhere, they’re free, and best of all, 
they’re versatile. You can use a wall in a great variety of postures: to support 
your buttocks and improve the angle of your forward bend, to brace your back 
heel in the standing postures, or to support the backs of your legs in the reclin-
ing raised-legs relaxation position. Walls also can support you in the more 
advanced inverted postures, such as the half shoulder stand (see Chapter 10), 
or as a frame of reference by which you can check your posture and alignment.
Using a blanket for more than bedding
Besides the obvious use of keeping you warm during relaxation, blankets 
can prop your hips in sitting postures, your head and neck in lying postures, 
and your waist in prone back bends like the locust posture. You also can use 
blankets as protective padding under your knees when kneeling. The firm-
ness of the blanket is important. You want something under your knees or 
neck that doesn’t sink or collapse, as does a padded blanket or comforter. 
Always use a firm, flat blanket and be sure to fold it thickly (or use more than 
one) when you need to raise your hips (or head or shoulders).

282
Part III: Creative Yoga 
 
Most blankets nowadays are made out of synthetic materials (or a synthetic/
wool blend) — a relief for people with wool allergies.
Choosing a chair for comfort
A folding metal chair or a sturdy wooden chair without arms can have mul-
tiple uses as a Yoga prop. Many (if not most) beginners have a hard time 
sitting on the floor for prolonged periods during meditation or breathing 
exercises, and sitting on a chair is a great alternative to sitting on the floor. 
Make sure, though, that your feet aren’t dangling; if they don’t easily touch 
the floor, place them on a phone book. Students with back problems often 
use a chair during the relaxation phase at the end of a Yoga class. Lying on 
your back and placing your lower legs up on a chair, combined with guided 
relaxation techniques from the instructor, can really help to release back 
tension or pain. You can find numerous books and magazine articles about 
doing your entire Yoga practice in a chair, with suggestions for ways to take 
Yoga chair breaks around the house or in your office for a quick pick-me-up.
Stretching with a strap
You most frequently use a strap with postures that involve stretching the 
hamstrings, most commonly from a supine reclining (lying on your back) 
or sitting position. Someone’s old karate belt or necktie works great, but so 
does a rolled-up towel or a bathrobe belt. You also can order an “official” 
Yoga strap from one of the mail-order companies we list in the appendix.
Prop proliferation
Yoga props and accessories from around the 
world are now big business in the United States. 
Yoga Master BKS Iyengar of Pune (pronounced 
poon-ah) more than any other teacher has influ-
enced the development of props for Hatha Yoga 
in modern times. Americans, however, have 
made some of their own breakthroughs in the 
area of Yoga-inspired props.
Yoga teacher Larry Jacobs of Newport Beach, 
California, invented the Body Slant (which we 
describe later in “Turning to inversion props”) 
and offers an entire line of safe and practical 
inversion furniture through mainstream mail-
order catalogs nationally. Renowned sports 
medicine physician Leroy R. Perry, Jr., DC, in 
Los Angeles, California, has developed special-
ized inversion products, known as Dr. Perry’s 
spinal decompressor devices, used by Yoga 
teachers and Yoga enthusiasts internationally.

Searching Out Props You 
May Want to Purchase
As you gain comfort and confidence Yoga practice, you’re sure to become 
curious about the array of props you either see being used in class or hear 
about from your association with fellow Yoga practitioners. Whether you 
plan to spend freely as you experiment with the best props for your per-
sonal situation, or you expect to approach buying a bit more conservatively, 
keep in mind that you’re likely to find a sweeping range of merchandise and 
price tags out there in consumer land. By investing wisely — with product 
research, plus understanding your own needs — you can enjoy greater 
rewards from your Yoga experience. Figure 19-1 shows you walls, straps, bol-
sters, blocks, and chairs — all common Yoga props. The following sections 
give you more information on buying them; check out the preceding section 
for ways you can mimic some props with household items.

Supporting alignment with 
the help of blocks
Some styles of Yoga incorporate blocks for improving or facilitating certain pos-
tures. You may find a block helpful in standing twists, when your bottom hand 
can’t make it to the floor, or in standing forward bends, to support your hands. 
Two blocks are ideal, but you can get by with one. If you use a block, it should be 
firm. Some students prefer the more substantial feel and heft of a wooden block, 
or they may like the lightness of foam or other light materials (especially if they 
drop the block on a floor or foot). For beginners, put the block down on the floor 
horizontally or lying flat. Think of the block as a raised floor to support you. Try 
not to clutch the block with your hands — just use it to aid your balance.
Commercially, blocks are available in a variety of materials, including wood, 
recycled and new foam, bamboo, and cork. The price varies with the size and 
material and ranges from $8 up to $30, with foam tending to be less expensive 
than wood, and cork somewhere in between.
 
If you decide to make your own block, a good standard is nine inches high, six 
inches wide, and four inches deep. Be sure that the block is well-sanded and 
varnished to eliminate the possibility of splinters. You can also tightly wrap up 
an old hardback book or two in some masking tape and use that for support.
Bolstering support with pillows
Bolsters are large, firm, usually rectangular or cylindrical pillows. You use 
them to support your knees in reclining postures, to help release your lower 
back and to raise your buttocks in forward bends, and to help soften tight 
hips and hamstrings. You can also place bolsters under your upper back to 
help open your chest when you lie over them. During the stress of pregnancy, 
bolsters are a great support for the side-lying posture (see Chapter 16). A 
good standard size for bolsters is 6 x 12 x 25 inches for the rectangular bol-
sters and 9 x 27 inches for the cylindrical shape.
Bolsters are usually made of thick cotton batting with a removable canvas cover-
ing that you can wash, and they come in a range of sizes, materials, and prices. 
Expect to pay somewhere in the range of $35 to $70, depending upon your taste 
and needs. You can also buy a pranayama bolster (see Chapter 5) that is long and 
thin (about 8 x 30 inches). One bolster is usually plenty for your personal use.
 
You can create your own bolsters by using thickly rolled blankets. In a pinch, 
sofa or bed pillows work, too — if they’re not too soft.

 Chapter 19: Prop Art: The Why and How of Simple Props
Eyeing the many applications of eye bags
Eye bags, also called eye pillows, are small bags filled with light materials 
(usually plastic pellets) that yogis and yoginis use for various relaxation tech-
niques. Although an eye bag may seem self-explanatory, there’s actually more 
to eye bags than meets the, well, eye. They of course block light and other 
visual stimuli, which helps quiet the brain; they also put gentle pressure on 
your eyes, which slows your heart rate. You can just cover your eyes with a 
towel, but the effect isn’t quite the same.
Eye bags are available in many shapes and sizes. Some eye bags are packed 
with herbal essences, which adds the incentive (in-scent-ive?) of aroma 
therapy, but be sure the perfume isn’t so strong it becomes bothersome. Eye 
bags are usually about 4 x 8 inches and cost from $10 to $20, depending on 
which type you choose; some more-expensive models tie down like a mask, 
which is usually unnecessary. (Check out the appendix for more on locat-
ing props.) You usually place one eye-bag across the top of both eyes while 
you’re in a lying position on your back.
 
If you decide to make your own eye bags, use materials such as cotton stuffed 
with rice, or silk stuffed with flaxseed. Even stuffing an old sock does the job. 
Be sure to do a good job on the seams — you don’t want flaxseed in your eyes!
Turning to inversion props
We purposely omitted the headstand and the full shoulder stand from this 
book because we feel that these postures require the guidance of a compe-
tent Yoga teacher. Because Western-world necks have become so weak and 
vulnerable, many physicians and a large number of chiropractors, orthope-
dists, and osteopaths aren’t in favor of inverted Yoga postures such as the 
headstand, the full shoulder stand, and the plow because they can compress 
the neck. Because the benefits of inversion and reversing the pull of gravity 
are so great (as we cover in Chapter 10), many entrepreneurs have attempted 
to create safe and effective inversion devices.
You can now find quite a selection of inversion apparatuses to suit various 
bodies and budgets. One that we like for its effectiveness, safety, and conve-
nience is the Body Slant created by yogi Larry Jacobs and shown in Figure 19-2. 
It’s the high-tech version of what used to be called Grandma’s Slant Board. 
These three pieces of firm foam that fold and unfold easily make inversion 
safe and simple. Just lie back for 10 minutes to receive the rejuvenating 
effects of inversion.

Ask your physician before using any new exercise device to be sure that the 
prop is right for your personal situation.
 
Avoid using the Body Slant or any other inversion prop if you have the follow-
ing conditions: glaucoma or retinopathy (disease of the retina), hiatal hernia, 
high blood pressure, heart disease, or a past stroke.

Yoga as a Lifestyle

In this part . . .
I
n this part, we take a two-pronged approach. We start 
by introducing you to the ways in which Yoga is so 
much more than physical exercise. We show you how you 
can adopt Yoga as a lifestyle that brings you inner peace 
and happiness, as well as the capacity to become a bea-
con of light for your family, friends, coworkers, and oth-
ers. We talk about your enormous spiritual and the power 
of living with moral integrity.
Then, we show you how you can maintain your lifestyle 
by making Yoga part of your life even when your aches 
and pains are getting you down. We provide examples of 
specific yogic exercises known to be safe and helpful, and 
a five-step plan to prevent back problems from becoming 
chronic. We also discuss how to know when using Yoga 
therapeutically on your own is safe, how to seek out a 
Yoga therapist, and when you should consult a doctor.

Chapter 20
Yoga Throughout the Day
In This Chapter
▶ Applying Yoga throughout the day
▶ Looking inward for health and harmony
▶ Developing moral practices
▶ Reaping rewards from self-discipline
T
he postures and breathing exercises of Hatha Yoga — some of which we 
cover in preceding chapters — are merely a couple of tools from Yoga’s 
well-stocked storehouse. When you practice them correctly, they’re extremely 
useful and potent in helping you regain or maintain your physical and mental 
health. Practicing postures and breathing can stabilize and boost your body’s 
vitality and even harmonize your emotions and strengthen your mind.
But postures and breathing exercises are only a beginning; they’re only two 
steps in the eightfold path of Raja Yoga (see Chapter 1 for more about Raja 
Yoga and the eightfold path). The real power of Yoga is unlocked when you 
approach it as a lifestyle or spiritual path. Yoga is a conscious way of life; it 
contains everything you need in order to transform your entire day. Just as 
a grand piano allows you to play music in eight octaves, Yoga gives you the 
means to tap into your full potential as a human being.
In this chapter, we show you how you can connect with your deeper potential 
and live your entire day the Yoga way. This approach includes paying proper 
attention to moral values, which are an important aspect of all branches and 
schools of Yoga but are often overlooked by Western practitioners.
Living Your Day the Yoga Way
When you decide to pursue Yoga as a lifestyle or spiritual discipline, you 
must be willing to practice it 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. You may think 
that this total commitment sounds difficult, and with good reason — living 

290
Part IV: Yoga as a Lifestyle 
this way is truly a challenge! At least, staying on track is difficult while you’re 
busy creating new habit patterns by laying down new pathways in your brain. 
After you change your thoughts and behavior, living the Yoga way is as easy 
as living any other routine, except the yogic lifestyle is far from routine.
Turning your face toward a Yoga morning
For thousands of years, Yoga practitioners have begun the day at sunrise, a 
time considered to be favorable and especially potent for meditation, prayer, 
and tapping into your highest potential. Called brahma-muhurta in Sanskrit 
(brah-mah moo-hoor-tah, which means “hour of brahman,” with brahman 
being the ultimate Reality), this time sets the right tone for the entire day.
Sunrise isn’t only a quiet, peaceful time but also a time charged with sym-
bolic significance for Yoga practitioners. Traditionally, the sun is celebrated 
as the first teacher, or guru, who brought the teachings of Yoga to human-
ity. According to Yoga, the sun is a symbol for the spirit, which shines with 
undiminished brightness forever. The sun salutation exercise described in 
Chapter 13 is one way yogis acknowledge their reverence for the inner sun.
Of course, India (Yoga’s native home) is blessed with a lot of sunshine. Even 
if your climate doesn’t offer much physical sun, you can still enjoy sunrise as 
a special, daily occasion — just ponder the sun’s profound symbolism!
Here are some suggestions for transforming an otherwise mundane daily 
routine into a meaningful ritual that can energize and prepare you for the 
onslaught of the day:
 
✓ Create a peaceful mood in your heart and remember your connection 
with everyone and everything. Do this work as soon as you wake up 
and before opening your eyes and getting out of bed. If you believe in a 
divine being (call it God, Goddess, or higher Self), this moment is good 
for inwardly aligning yourself to it/him/her.
 
✓ Write down any significant dreams. When you live an active life of 
self-transformation, dreams often carry important messages. They may 
mirror and confirm your present inner development or stream of expe-
riences, or they may provide you with a key for understanding what 
you’re going through. If you don’t write down your dreams shortly after 
waking, you’re likely to forget them. If you find that they fade from your 
mind rapidly, you may want to consider jotting them down in a diary 
before making your daily resolution (samkalpa, pronounced sahm-kahl-
pah), which we cover next.

291
 Chapter 20: Yoga Throughout the Day
 
✓ Affirm your highest resolve. For example, repeat (aloud or in your 
mind) your resolution, such as “I intend to act all day long in accordance 
to the highest spiritual and moral principles,” “I intend to be (more) 
compassionate today,” “I intend to harm no one and benefit as many 
people as possible,” “I intend to think only positive, benign thoughts 
today,” and so on. Repeat your intention (samkalpa) with great convic-
tion three or more times.
 
 Remembering an affirmation throughout the day is often difficult for 
beginning students. Try carrying something small around with you, such 
as a pebble, a button, or a ring, that can jog your memory whenever you 
see or touch it.
 
✓ Before getting out of bed, consciously relax and take ten deep breaths.
 
✓ Stretch and thus fire up your muscles while you’re still in bed.
 
✓ Use the bathroom, wash, and brush your teeth.
 
✓ Meditate. If you meditate sitting on your bed, your mind inevitably asso-
ciates “bed” with “sleep.” See Chapter 21 for more information on the art 
of meditation. Some authorities recommend that you do postures and 
breathing exercises before meditation, but we feel this preparation is 
only necessary when your mind tends to be sluggish in the early morn-
ing and you need to jump-start it. If you wake up easily and happily in 
the morning, use that time for meditation or prayer.
 
✓ Do your Hatha Yoga program to vitalize your body and fortify your mind.
If you can’t practice in the morning (because, for example, you have to be at 
work when the rooster crows), make sure that you leave room in your sched-
ule for Hatha Yoga and/or meditation at some other time during the day 
or in the evening. Even a few minutes of postures and breathing exercises 
are better than no exercises at all. But more importantly, always start your 
day right by making your resolution upon waking and centering yourself by 
breathing consciously.
Too much of a good thing
Exposure to sunlight early in the morning is 
beneficial. Later on, the sun’s ultraviolet rays 
become lethal, causing skin cancer from pro-
longed exposure. Yoga practitioners refrain 
from the widespread practice of baking in 
the sun (or under an artificial light source) to 
achieve a tan.

292
Part IV: Yoga as a Lifestyle 
 
If you have a family, make formal agreements with your partner and/or chil-
dren so that you can practice Yoga as undisturbed as possible. Be sure that 
everyone is aware of and honors your private time. If need be, lock your door 
or post a reminder sign. You may not always be able to get private time, espe-
cially when you have young children. In that case, try to do whatever prac-
tices you can while you’re still in bed, and then include your children in your 
Yoga program. As a parent, you’re the best role model for your children, and 
even toddlers can participate in your Yoga practice.
Some people are super-busy — going to bed late at night after they’re exhausted 
and starting out the next morning still feeling tired. A regular Hatha Yoga rou-
tine can give you energy, making regular practice well worth the time it takes. 
Beyond the physical and mental benefits, Yoga provides much-needed quiet 
time, where you can be by yourself without distraction. If your situation permits, 
arrange to have 15 minutes a day that you can consider all yours. Make a cre-
ative deal with your partner and/or children that can benefit everyone.
Or, if you live alone and feel the pressures of time and attention to lots of details, 
just negotiate an agreement with the person who shows up in your mirror. You 
can be a better friend to that face if you set aside some time for inward glances.
Practicing Yoga throughout the day
You have many opportunities to apply the wisdom of Yoga as activities and 
situations during the day. Whether you stay at home with your children or 
hold down a job outside the home, you have at your disposal an array of 
tools from Yoga’s versatile toolbox for all circumstances. Here are only a few 
Yoga with your youngsters
If you have young children and have no lei-
sure time to practice Yoga on your own, don’t 
despair! Make the most of the situation. As the 
saying goes, if you can’t beat them, join them. 
Your kids will love it — at least while the nov-
elty lasts. Depending on their age and general 
disposition, the youngsters may get used to 
this little routine and happily participate in it or, 
if not, they may at least allow you to practice 
your own Yoga routine without too many inter-
ruptions. If you don’t want them to get bored, 
you must make the session fun for the kids. As 
you well know, the universe revolves around 
children and their needs — until they learn 
otherwise. Your own peacefulness can defi-
nitely have a calming effect on them. Check out 
Chapter 17 for more on doing Yoga with kids.

293
 Chapter 20: Yoga Throughout the Day
situations in which you can fruitfully apply yogic wisdom (although any situa-
tion can benefit from good Yoga practice):
 
✓ Encountering heavy traffic during your daily commute to and from work
 
✓ Dealing with customers, a demanding boss, or fellow employees
 
✓ Enjoying breakfast, lunch, and dinner (see the nearby sidebar “The yogic 
art of conscious eating”)
 
✓ Experiencing pregnancy and childbirth (head to Chapter 16)
 
✓ Responding when your child’s behavior leaves much to be desired
 
✓ Living through a health crisis
 
✓ Enjoying vacations and holidays
 
✓ Doing the daily shopping
 
✓ Grieving over the death of a loved one
 
✓ Watching television
 
✓ Having sex
To all these situations you can bring awareness, which is the foundation for 
all other positive attitudes and practices. You can also bring understanding, 
patience, calmness, forgiveness, kindness, compassion, love, good humor, 
and a host of other virtues. By practicing various Yoga techniques, you can 
also calm your mind and raise your energy level or bring energy to others.
 
Don’t think of the world as “out there” and your Yoga practice as “in here.” 
Because Yoga connects inside and outside, such a distinction is artificial. Allow 
your practice to flow over into all situations. You’re never so busy that you can’t 
transform a few seconds of free time into meaningful time through Yoga: Exhale 
deeply, center yourself, silently recite a mantra, or bless someone.
Incorporating Yoga into nighttime routines
When you live Yoga as a spiritual discipline, the practice extends even to 
your sleep. In Chapter 4, we give you a relaxation technique that’s better 
than any sleeping pill for preparing you for sleep. You can make this tech-
nique even more powerful by repeating the same intention (samkalpa) that 
you also use upon waking; flip to “Turning your face toward a Yoga morning” 
earlier in the chapter for more on the samkalpa. Repeat your intention when 
your relaxation is deepest and before emerging from it or falling asleep.

Sleeping peacefully with lucid dreaming
You can benefit from taking note of your dreams, keeping a diary of at least 
the more significant ones. But dedicated yogis and yoginis seek to transform 
their dream life altogether by training themselves in lucid dreaming, a special 
state of consciousness in which you retain a degree of self-awareness while 
dreaming. In other words, you know that you’re dreaming and, with practice, 
even are able to direct your dreams. Usually lucid dreaming occurs spontane-
ously, but by priming your mind before going to sleep you can increase the 
likelihood of becoming self-aware in the midst of a dream. If you’re interested 
in exploring this art, we recommend that you study the resources listed in 
this book’s appendix. In the meantime, here are some pointers for program-
ming yourself to dream lucidly:
 
✓ Become generally more aware of your thoughts, feelings, and sensations.
 
✓ Take an interest in your dreams.
 
✓ Get up a couple of hours earlier than usual and go about your regular 
chores.
The yogic art of conscious eating
What you eat forms your body. In turn, the con-
dition of your body and especially the nervous 
system affects your mind, which affects your 
entire life. Thus the traditional maxim “You are 
what you eat” holds true to a certain degree. 
Yoga masters have typically been vegetarians, 
favoring grains, legumes, and fruit. In your diet, 
stick as close to Mother Nature as possible.
As important as what you eat is how you eat. 
Of all the recommendations made by Yoga mas-
ters, the single most important is to practice mod-
eration. This habit is called mitahara (from mita 
or “moderate” and ahara or “food” in Sanskrit, 
pronounced mee-tah-hah-rah). Basically, you 
avoid both overeating and starving yourself.
Overeating not only puts pounds on you but also 
multiplies toxins in your body and makes you 
feel emotionally weighed down. Similarly, if you 
don’t feed your body adequately, you weaken it 
and also risk causing disease. The best policy 
is to eat only when you’re hungry (not just peck-
ish). The right amount to eat varies from person 
to person and also according to climate and 
season. Find out for yourself by trial and error. 
Remember, though, that certain health condi-
tions require frequent eating.
Another important yogic rule about diet is to eat 
with awareness. Here are some simple sug-
gestions for changing unyogic or mechanical 
habits while you eat:
 ✓ Calm down first if you’re agitated.
 ✓ Keep your attention on the task of eating.
 ✓ Eat slowly and chew your food well.
 ✓ Pay attention to the wonderful taste sensa-
tions in your mouth.
 ✓ Breathe.
 ✓ Be grateful for your food.

295
 Chapter 20: Yoga Throughout the Day
 
✓ Slip back into bed and think about lucid dreaming and what sort of 
dream you want to create for about 30 minutes.
 
✓ Allow yourself at least two hours for dreaming before finally getting up.
 
✓ Induce lucid dreaming by doing the kind of deep relaxation exercise 
(Yoga Nidra) that we describe in Chapter 4.
 
✓ Clearly form the intention to dream lucidly.
You may not succeed the first or second time you try, but then again, pleas-
ant surprises may be just a dream away!
Aiming toward awareness 
through lucid waking
More important than lucid dreaming is lucid waking — the art of being pres-
ent in the moment, of living with mindfulness throughout the day. In a way, 
lucid dreaming is an extension of lucid waking. If you acquire the knack 
of becoming aware in the dream state but continue to sleepwalk in your 
waking life, you can’t expect to gain very much. If you’re aware but lacking 
in understanding or wisdom in the waking state, you also lack understanding 
or wisdom in the dream state. Yoga is first and foremost about lucid waking, 
which means penetrating the illusions and delusions of ordinary life with 
the searchlight of full awareness. After you clear your mind of its inherent 
misconceptions and biases, you can bring the same clear mind to unordinary 
states of consciousness, including dreaming and deep sleep.
Approaching mindfulness in deep sleep
For the serious Yoga practitioner, even deep sleep isn’t a no-man’s land. On 
the contrary, dreamless sleep is a great opportunity for breaking into higher 
levels of consciousness. After you’re able to retain mindful awareness during 
the dream state, you can extend your awareness to those periods where the 
mind is devoid of contents. The great Yoga masters are continuously aware 
throughout the day and the night. They’re never unconscious, because they 
have realized the spirit or Self, which is pure consciousness.
If constant awareness sounds exhausting, consider the deep peacefulness 
that the Yoga masters are able to achieve. Pure consciousness is the simplest 
thing in the world. Hence, it’s called the natural state, or sahaja-avastha (sah-
hah-jah ah-vahst-hah). By comparison, the mind is vastly complicated. Just 
remember how thinking (especially when you’re obsessing over something) 
can be incredibly exhausting.

Part IV: Yoga as a Lifestyle 
Seeking Your Higher Self by 
Discovering the True You
However they may conceive the ultimate goal, all schools of Yoga seek to 
open a door to your true nature, which we call the spirit or higher Self. You 
can find as many approaches to Self-realization (or enlightenment) as you 
can human beings. Everyone’s spiritual journey is unique, yet everyone’s 
inner evolution follows certain universal principles. That fundamental 
process is marked by progressive self-observation, self-understanding, self-
discipline, and self-transcendence, which are all interconnected practices. The 
most significant principle is that in order to discover your essential nature, 
you must overcome the gravity pull of your ordinary habit patterns (laid 
down as neural pathways in your brain).
Observing yourself
In Yoga, you simply begin to observe yourself. Staying in tune with yourself is 
different from the neurotic self-watching that’s merely a form of self-involvement. 
Self-observation means being consciously aware of how you think and behave 
without judging yourself in any way.
Self-observation includes noticing — in a nonjudgmental way — how you react 
to people and situations. For instance, you may discover that in many ways, 
you’re often overly critical or too gullible and accommodating. Or you may 
determine that you tend to be rather inward and afraid of engaging life or that 
you never think before you leap. The natural calmness that you create through 
Yoga’s physical exercises can help you start uncovering your tendencies — 
without collapsing into self-recrimination or exploding into anger with others.
Swami Rama baffles scientists
In 1969, Swami Rama volunteered to have 
his yogic abilities tested at the Menninger 
Foundation in Topeka, Kansas. Among other 
things, he demonstrated his ability to produce 
all types of brain waves at will. He remained 
fully aware even when producing the slow delta 
waves characteristic of deep sleep. In fact, he 
was able to remember what happened during 
his supposed deep sleep much better than did 
the researchers themselves. Two years later, 
Swami Rama founded the Himalayan Institute 
in Honesdale, Pennsylvania, which continues to 
spread his teachings. Check out the appendix 
for the Institute’s address.

297
 Chapter 20: Yoga Throughout the Day
Understanding yourself
Based on self-observation, self-understanding involves grasping the deeper 
reasons for your habit patterns. Ultimately, self-understanding is the realiza-
tion that all your thoughts and behaviors revolve around the ego, an artificial 
psychological pole. Your ego allows you to identify yourself in a very specific 
way. For example:
“I’m Frank, a 35-year-old, Caucasian male and a United States citizen. I’m 
5 foot 11 inches tall, have an athletic build, weigh 165 pounds, and have 
blue eyes and brown hair. I’m married, have two children, and am an 
electronic engineer who likes to go parachuting. I’m a capitalist, reason-
ably ambitious, but not very religious.”
These ego-identifications are useful in your daily life — as long as they don’t 
cause you to feel separated from your spiritual core or to create barriers to 
other people.
You have to be very careful not to take the ego habit too seriously; the ego 
is nothing more than a way of quickly identifying yourself both verbally and 
psychologically. It’s not your true nature, the spirit or Self. Most importantly, 
it’s not an actual entity in its own right but merely something you habitually 
do. The ego is based on the process of self-contraction (atma-samkoca, pro-
nounced aht-mah sahm-koh-chah). The symbol for the ego is a clenched fist. 
Yoga shows you how to release that fist and engage life from the viewpoint 
of the spirit or Self, which is in harmonious relationship with everyone and 
everything.
Practicing self-discipline
When a seed sprouts, it must first push through the soil before it can benefit 
from the sunlight. Similarly, before you can experience the higher levels of 
Yoga, you must overcome the built-in lethargy of your ego-driven personal-
ity, which doesn’t want to change. Self-observation and self-understanding 
become increasingly effective through the practice of self-discipline — the 
steady cultivation of spiritual practices.
By exercising voluntary self-control over your thoughts, behaviors, and 
energies, you can gradually transform your body-mind into a finely tuned 
instrument for higher spiritual realizations and harmonious living. You can’t 
practice self-discipline without frustrating the ego a little, because the ego 
always tends to move along the path of least resistance. Yogic practice cre-
ates the necessary resistance to spark further growth in you.

298
Part IV: Yoga as a Lifestyle 
Transcending yourself
Self-transcendence is at the heart of the spiritual process. This impulse and 
practice of going beyond the ego-contraction in every moment — through 
self-observation, self-understanding, and self-discipline — comes to full blos-
som in the great event of enlightenment, when your entire being is trans-
formed by the spirit, or Self (see Chapter 21).
Making Inroads into the Eightfold 
Path with Moral Discipline
The eightfold path of Yoga, as we outline it in Chapter 1, is a useful model 
for the stages of the yogic process. In the following sections, we explain the 
first limb of the eightfold path in more detail because along with the second 
limb, it gives you the essential moral foundation for practicing Yoga success-
fully. We start with the five practices of moral discipline (yama), which Yoga 
insists that you must practice under all circumstances. They’re the same 
moral virtues that you find in all the world’s great religious traditions:
 
✓ Nonharming or ahimsa (pronounced ah-heem-sah)
 
✓ Truthfulness or satya (pronounced saht-yah)
 
✓ Nonstealing or asteya (pronounced ahs-the-yah)
 
✓ Chastity or brahmacarya (pronounced brah-mah-chahr-yah)
 
✓ Greedlessness or aparigraha (pronounced ah-pah-ree-grah-hah)
These five disciplines are meant to harmonize your interpersonal life and 
are especially important in today’s enormously complex world. Much of the 
social chaos in today’s world is due to the collapse of a common system of 
basic moral values. Yoga reminds you that you can’t attain self-fulfillment in 
isolation from others. You can’t hope to realize your higher nature without 
fostering what’s good and beautiful in your day-to-day life in interaction 
with your family, friends, co-workers, teachers, and students. Thus, univer-
sally recognized moral virtues are the rich soil in which you plant all your 
other efforts on the path of inner growth and ultimate Self-realization (or 
enlightenment).
Yoga understands these virtues to be all-comprehensive, extending not only 
to your actions but also to your language and even your thoughts. In other 
words, you’re called to abstain from doing wrong to others, speaking wrong 
of them, as well as poisoning them with your thoughts.

299
 Chapter 20: Yoga Throughout the Day
Vowing to do no harm
The practice of nonharming comes — or should come — into play hundreds 
of times a day. The more sensitive you become toward the effect you have 
on others, the more you’re called to live with moral mindfulness. How do you 
practice the virtue of nonharming in your life? You may think of yourself as 
a fairly harmless individual because you don’t physically or verbally abuse 
anyone, but have you ever started or listened to gossip? And what about 
feeling negatively toward an annoying client or customer or an inconsiderate 
driver who just took your parking space?
 
Nonharming is not only abstaining from harmful actions, speech, and thoughts but 
also actively doing what’s appropriate in a given moment to avoid unnecessary 
pain to others. For example, even withholding a smile or kind word from someone 
when you sense that the gesture may benefit that person is a form of harming.
In order to live, humans involuntarily harm and even kill other beings — just 
think of the billions of microorganisms in your food and even in your own 
body that give up their lives so that you can stay alive and be healthy. The 
ideal of nonharming is just that: an ideal to which you may aspire. The con-
cept calls for abstaining from deliberately harming other beings. As a useful 
exercise, ask yourself these questions:
 
✓ How many times today have I spoken harshly?
 
✓ When did I last kill a harmless spider instead of leaving it alone or relo-
cating it?
 
✓ Are my thoughts about things and people predominantly pessimistic, 
overly optimistic, or simply realistic?
 
✓ When I have to correct someone’s behavior, do I merely criticize or also 
encourage?
Yoga definitely expects you to control your anger and murderous thoughts — 
not to be confused with merely suppressing your feelings (which never works 
anyway). Yoga also encourages you to cultivate, step by step, better habits 
and mental dispositions. As you become more peaceful and content, you 
don’t react so strongly and irrationally to life’s pressures but rather become 
more and more able to go with the flow — with awareness, a smile, and a 
helping hand. According to Yoga, a person grounded in nonharming is sur-
rounded by such an aura of peace that even wild beasts become tame.
If you become aware of the various ways in which you harm others through 
your thoughts, words, and actions, don’t succumb to feeling overwhelmed 
with guilt. That negative response is just another way of perpetuating violence. 
Simply acknowledge the situation, feel remorse, resolve to behave differently, 
and then also actively change your mental, verbal, and physical behavior.

Part IV: Yoga as a Lifestyle 
Telling the truth all the time
These days, many folks seem to believe that truth is relative. Yoga, however, 
insists that facts and perspectives are many but truth is always one and that 
truthfulness (satya) is a supreme moral virtue. Truth is the cement that holds 
together good relationships and entire societies.
The sorry condition of modern society says something about the society’s 
commitment (or lack thereof) to truth. For instance, consider the following 
questions:
 
✓ Have you ever told a little white lie not because you wanted to protect 
someone but because you deemed it more convenient than to tell the 
truth?
 
✓ Have you ever prettified or omitted certain facts from your resumé to 
look more suitable to a prospective employer?
 
✓ Have you ever failed to declare taxable income (even that negligible 
amount that no one could possibly care about)?
 
✓ Have you ever instructed your spouse to say you aren’t at home when 
an unwanted caller is on the phone for you?
 
✓ Have you ever lied about your age?
 
✓ Do you ever fail to keep your promises? (This question is a must for 
politicians.)
Probably, few people can answer all these questions with a resounding “No,” 
unless, of course, they’re lying to themselves. Admittedly, lies appear to vary 
by degree of severity. You may consider these examples fairly insignificant, 
and from a conventional point of view, they are. But Yoga doesn’t let you 
off the hook so easily. Yogic practice values simplicity and clarity, whereas 
lying usually ends up being more complicated and confusing. Yoga is also 
concerned about the pathways you build in your brain. If you become accus-
tomed to not telling the truth in little matters, sooner or later you may not be 
able to distinguish truth from falsehood in big matters as well.
 
Truthfulness is a marvelous tool for keeping your energy pure and your will 
undiluted. Of course, in your attempts to be truthful, you must bear the prin-
cipal moral virtue of nonharming (covered in the preceding section) in mind. 
Life isn’t black and white; many gray areas exist. If speaking the truth may 
bring more harm than good to another person, you’re wise to remain silent. 
As with nonharming, your intention is the key.

301
 Chapter 20: Yoga Throughout the Day
Stealing means more than material theft
Nonstealing (asteya), the third moral discipline, is trickier than it looks at 
a casual glance. You need not be a pickpocket, shoplifter, bank robber, or 
embezzler to violate this virtue. From the perspective of Yoga, depriving 
someone of his or her due reward or good name is also theft. So is appropri-
ating someone’s ideas without due acknowledgment, stealing someone’s boy-
friend or girlfriend, or denying your child proper parental guidance.
 
To ponder the ideal of nonstealing, you may want to answer these questions:
 
✓ What percentage of your income do you allocate for charitable causes?
 
✓ Have you ever used someone else’s time left on a parking meter, know-
ing that this widespread practice is actually against the law?
 
✓ Are any of your computer programs bootlegged copies (a criminal 
offense)?
 
✓ Did you ever withhold love from a family member or friend because you 
wanted to punish him or her?
Traditionally, those people who are well established in the virtue of nonsteal-
ing are described as always being sustained by life; they never lack anything 
for their further growth. The greatest antidote to the vice of stealing is gener-
osity. A fulfilling life is a life that elegantly balances giving and taking.
Highly competitive Western society is designed to promote self-centeredness 
to the point where people constantly infringe the virtues of nonharming, 
truthfulness, and nonstealing. (Head to the preceding two sections for more 
on those first two values.) The kind of aggressive competitiveness rampant 
in the business world is all about elbowing your way to the top, beating the 
other guy, using any means necessary to outsmart your opponent, and win-
ning the game at all costs.
Observing chastity in thought and deed
Chastity (brahmacarya, pronounced brah-mah-chahr-yah), which is a highly 
valued virtue in all traditional societies, means abstention from inappropri-
ate sexual behavior. According to Yoga, only adults who are in a committed 
marriage or partnership should be sexually active; all others should practice 
sexual abstinence. For many Westerners, this standard is very difficult.

302
Part IV: Yoga as a Lifestyle 
Yogically speaking, you must extend the ideal of chastity to action, speech, 
and even thought. We leave it up to you to determine where, in your own 
case, you can change your behavior to bring it more in line with Yoga’s moral 
orientation. Bear in mind that Yoga isn’t asking you to go against human 
nature, which includes sexuality. Rather, Yoga invites you to consider your 
higher spiritual potential. The Yoga masters recommend chastity not for 
prudish reasons but because it’s an effective way of harnessing your body’s 
vital energy. The practitioner who is firmly grounded in chastity supposedly 
obtains vigor or vitality.
 
If you engage Yoga as a lifestyle or spiritual discipline, periodically taking 
stock of your virtues and vices can help you build toward achievement of your 
higher Self. When considering your sexuality, ask yourself these questions:
 
✓ Do I tend to use sexually suggestive or explicit language?
 
✓ Do I use sex for emotional security or for personal power?
 
✓ Am I flirtatious and, if so, why?
 
✓ Do I know the distinction between sex and love?
 
✓ Am I capable of true intimacy, or do I treat my partner as a sex object?
Acquiring more by living with less
Greed is a vice that underlies much of modern consumerism. From a yogic 
point of view, greed is a failed search for happiness, because whatever pos-
sessions you may acquire can’t fulfill you. On the contrary, the more you’re 
surrounded by “stuff,” the more likely you are to experience a big gaping hole 
in your soul. Intrinsically, money and possessions aren’t “wrong,” but few 
people ever master the art of relating to them properly. Instead of owning 
things, they’re owned (controlled) by them.
Yoga holds high the ideal of voluntary simplicity — the choice to live simply. 
How do you measure up to it? Try to answer these questions honestly:
 
✓ Have you ever been called a miser?
 
✓ Do you have too much “stuff”?
 
✓ Do you expect to be pampered?
 
✓ Do you tend to overeat?
 
✓ Do you accumulate money and possessions because you worry about 
the future?
 
✓ Are you overly attached to your partner or child?

303
 Chapter 20: Yoga Throughout the Day
 
✓ Do you like to be the center of attention?
 
✓ Are you envious of your neighbors?
Yoga encourages you to cultivate the virtue of greedlessness in all matters. 
The Sanskrit word for this value is aparigraha (pronounced ah-pah-ree-grah-
ha), which means “not grasping all round.” The Yoga practitioner who is well-
trained in the art of greedlessness is said to understand the deeper reason 
for his or her life. Behind this traditional wisdom lies a profound experience: 
As you loosen your grip on material possessions, you also let go of the ego, 
which is doing the gripping or grasping. As the ego-contraction relaxes, you 
increasingly become in touch with the abiding happiness of your true self. 
Then you realize that you need nothing at all to be happy. You’re uncon-
cerned about the future and live fully in the present. You aren’t afraid to give 
freely to others and also share with them your inner abundance.
Adding other moral practices
In addition to the five moral virtues listed by Yoga master Patanjali in his 
Yoga-Sutra, other Yoga texts mention the following as belonging to the first 
limb of the eightfold path:
 
✓ Sympathy or daya (pronounced dah-yah)
 
✓ Compassion or karuna (pronounced kah-roo-nah)
 
✓ Integrity or arjava (pronounced ahr-jah-vah)
 
✓ Patience or kshama (pronounced kshah-mah)
 
✓ Steadfastness or dhriti (pronounced dhree-tee)
 
✓ Nonattachment or vairagya (pronounced vie-rah-gyah)
 
✓ Modesty or hri (pronounced hree — the initial letter h is sounded out loud)
 
✓ Humility or amanitva (pronounced ah-mah-neet-vah)
As you can see, Yoga has the highest expectations for a serious practitioner. 
But becoming a saint isn’t the goal. Yoga is about freedom and happiness. 
The moral virtues are natural side effects of a life dedicated to Self-
realization, or spiritual enlightenment (which we discuss in Chapter 21).
Exercising Yogic Self-Discipline
The second category or limb of the eightfold path is known as restraint 
(niyama), also translated as “self-restraint.” We explain the second limb here 

304
Part IV: Yoga as a Lifestyle 
because it’s an integral part of the moral orientation of Yoga, which Western 
practitioners frequently give short shrift. According to Patanjali, restraint 
comprises five practices:
 
✓ Purity or shauca (pronounced shau-chah — the au sounds similar to ow 
in cow)
 
✓ Contentment or samtosha (pronounced sahm-toh-shah)
 
✓ Austerity or tapas (pronounced tah-pahs)
 
✓ Study or svadhyaya (pronounced svahd-hyah-yah)
 
✓ Dedication to a higher principle or ishvara-pranidhana (pronounced 
eesh-vah-rah prah-need-hah-nah)
Purifying mind and body
An old saying from the Puritan tradition suggests, “Cleanliness is next to 
godliness.” Yoga goes further, stating that perfect purity and divinity are one 
and the same. All of Yoga is a process of self-purification. It begins with mental 
purification (through the practice of the moral disciplines described earlier in 
this chapter), proceeds to bodily cleansing (through various purification tech-
niques, including postures and breath control), followed by more profound 
mental purification (through sensory inhibition, concentration, meditation, and 
the ecstatic state), and ends with realizing the perfect purity of the spirit itself.
The Sanskrit word for “purity” is shauca, which has the root meaning of 
“being radiant.” The ultimate reality, or spirit, is pure radiance. As you clean 
the windows of your body-mind, you invite in more of the spirit’s light. 
Accomplished Yoga masters have a radiance about them.
Calming the quest through contentment
Contentment (samtosha) is traditionally defined as being satisfied with what 
life presents to you. When you’re content, you have joy in your heart and 
you don’t need anything else. You can face life with great calm. That doesn’t 
mean, however, that you need to avoid improvements in your situation, such 
as finding a better job or studying for a diploma or degree. It just means your 
quest for improvement doesn’t come from a place of neediness or gnawing 
dissatisfaction.
Focusing with austerity
Austerity (tapas) entails all kinds of practices designed to test your willpower 
and awaken the energy locked away in your body. Traditionally, these tests 

305
 Chapter 20: Yoga Throughout the Day
included strict dieting or prolonged fasting, staying awake for several days, 
or sitting completely still in meditation directly under the hot Indian sun. Few 
of these practices are possible for modern Westerners, but the basic princi-
ple behind tapas (literally meaning “heat”) is as valid now as it was thousands 
of years ago: Whenever you want to make progress on the path of Yoga, you 
must avoid wasting your energy on things that are irrelevant to your inner 
development. By carefully regulating your mental and physical behavior, you 
generate more energy for yogic practice.
But progress calls for overcoming all kinds of inner resistances. Tapas makes 
a demand on you, which creates a certain amount of inner heat. Change is 
never easy, and for many people, self-discipline is a big stumbling block. 
They tend to give up too soon. Yet self-discipline — through the strength of 
your will — is within reach. Just persist and observe how your goals move 
closer. For instance, your effort to overcome laziness and practice Yoga regu-
larly is a form of tapas, which gradually strengthens your willpower.
A good way to practice tapas is by periodically going on a retreat, where 
you have nothing to distract you from your inner work. Retreats provide an 
opportunity to clearly see all your tendencies in technicolor and start turning 
them around by creating better patterns of thought and behavior. Austerity 
isn’t about self-chastisement; it’s an intelligent way of testing and strengthen-
ing your willpower. Remember, Yoga doesn’t seek to increase pain and suffer-
ing but to remove it. Always be kind to yourself and, as your commitment to 
inner growth increases, don’t hesitate to challenge yourself firmly.
Partnering research with self-study
Self-study (svadhyaya) is an important part of traditional Yoga, although con-
temporary Western practitioners who fail to understand its great value often 
neglect it. Self-study means both studying for yourself and studying yourself. 
Traditionally, this commitment involved poring over the sacred scriptures, 
reciting them, and meditating on their meanings. In this way, practitioners 
stayed in touch with the tradition and also gained self-understanding, because 
study of the scriptures always confronts you with yourself. For basic study, we 
recommend the following Yoga texts, which are all available in good English 
translations; flip to Chapter 1 for more on the specific branches of Yoga:
 
✓ Yoga-Sutra of Patanjali, the standard text on Raja Yoga
 
✓ Bhagavad-Gita, the earliest available Sanskrit text on Jnana Yoga, Karma 
Yoga, and Bhakti Yoga
 
✓ Hatha-Yoga-Pradipika, one of the classical manuals of Hatha Yoga
 
✓ Yoga-Vasishtha, a marvelous work on Jnana Yoga; filled with traditional 
stories and beautiful poetic imagery
 
✓ Bhakti-Sutra of Narada, a classical work on Bhakti Yoga

You can find full or partial translations of numerous Yoga texts in my (Georg’s) 
The Yoga Tradition (Hohm Press). You can find more information in the 
appendix.
Why study the Yoga scriptures? They’re the distillations of several thousand 
years of experimentation and experience. If you’re serious about Yoga, why 
not benefit from the wisdom of the accomplished adepts of this tradition?
Today, you can usefully extend your study to include not only important 
Yoga scriptures but also contemporary knowledge that can further your self-
understanding. Yoga practitioners who recognize the great ideas and forces 
that are shaping modern civilization are better equipped to study them-
selves. To understand yourself, you must also understand the world you live 
in. You don’t have to become an intellectual (unless you happen to be one), 
but studying of the various components of human nature is wonderful mental 
training, and it can help you thoroughly comprehend the wisdom of Yoga.
Relating to a higher principle
The third element of self-restraint (niyama) is devotion to a higher principle. 
The Sanskrit term is ishvara-pranidhana, where the word ishvara means 
“lord,” referring to the divine. We translate it as “higher principle” to empha-
size that you don’t need to believe in a personal God to perform this practice. 
Devotion to a higher principle essentially means keeping your sight fixed on 
realizing your highest spiritual potential. If you happen to believe in a per-
sonal deity, you can use the traditional practice of repeating whatever name 
you have for the divine until your mind becomes absorbed in the state of 
contemplation. Or you can employ prayers and invocations to feel near to 
God or Goddess. But always remember that, according to Yoga, the divine 
isn’t a separate being but the essence of everything.

You’ve probably heard the saying, “You give as good as you get.” The 
same goes for Yoga. Doing a few postures now and then certainly gives 
you some benefits; however, to reap Yoga’s full rewards, you need to live 
a yogic lifestyle — a lifestyle that encompasses the physical, mental, and 
spiritual.
Yoga postures are a great place to start. Combined with a decent diet, Yoga 
postures take care of 80 percent of your physical well-being and also have a 
positive effect on your emotional health. (The other 20 percent comes from 
adequate sleep, meaningful work, and a reasonably happy family life.)
Beyond the basic benefits of a healthy body, the physical practice of Yoga 
can help you continue to explore your deeper mental and spiritual potential. 
In fact, a vital, healthy body is the best foundation for meditation (yogic con-
centration) and the higher reaches of Yoga. Try meditating when your nose 
is blocked from a cold, when you’re running a fever, or when your back is kill-
ing you. Pain and discomfort may make you philosophical (“Why me?”), but 
they don’t contribute to a basically relaxed mind. And that’s exactly why you 
need to meditate.
Many chapters in this book deal specifically with Yoga postures, which 
are designed to relax your body and thus prepare your mind for the higher 
stages of Yoga. This chapter explains how to integrate meditation into your 
routine so that you can reach the top rung of the Yoga ladder.

Understanding Concentration
How busy is your mind? Can you concentrate easily? The following little exer-
cise gauges your CQ (Concentration Quotient):
Think of a beautiful white swan. It looks neither left nor right but just slowly 
and majestically glides across the surface of a pond. It barely causes ripples 
in the water. Just keep thinking of that swan. Try to form a clear image and 
then hold it as steadily as possible in your mind while slowly counting down 
from 100.
How far did you manage to count before your mental image of the swan 
faded into thin air or another thought intruded? Was it 97 or 96? Perhaps you 
lost your concentration with the count of 99. You may have been able to con-
tinue your counting for several more numbers, but reaching much beyond 96 
is unusual for most beginners. If you did, your power of concentration is 
good — only a yogi or yogini can count all the way to 0 and think of the swan.
If you think you didn’t do well with this exercise because visualizing isn’t 
your strong suit, try this one for good measure:
Sit quietly. Take a few deep breaths and then let your mind go totally blank. 
No thoughts, no images, no counting — no ripples in your mental pond at all. 
Just sit. Just be.
How did you do? Don’t feel bad if your concentration exercise went some-
thing like this:
“. . . Okay, I’m not thinking. Heck, that’s a thought, isn’t it? Let me try 
again. . . . That’s much better. See? Having no images isn’t that difficult. 
And what was that about counting? I didn’t do too well with the count-
ing test, but I hate tests. Oh darn, I’m thinking again. Okay, back to no 
thoughts. . . .”
Don’t be discouraged if your mind is a veritable speed train and your con-
centration is too poor to slow it down. Your mind’s forward charge merely 
means that you have room for improvement, and you will improve with prac-
tice. Distraction isn’t negative in itself. Instead, you can look at your lack of 
clear concentration as an opportunity to gently refocus your attention. As 
you refocus repeatedly, your mind can become more obedient. Think of your 
mind as a spirited foal that exuberantly gallops around the meadow. With a 
little training, that frisky colt can become an excellent racehorse. The follow-
ing sections delve into how concentration works and what it can do for you.

 Chapter 21: Meditation and the Higher Reaches of Yoga
Unleashing your essence
The ability to concentrate is a boon to everything you do. Without it, you’d 
constantly hammer your finger rather than a nail, you’d miscalculate your 
taxes, and you’d be unable to follow the razor-sharp logic of Sherlock Holmes.
Yogic concentration is far more demanding than the kind of concentra-
tion you use in daily life; but it’s also much more rewarding. Yoga can help 
you unlock the hidden chambers of your own mind. When you’re able to 
focus your attention on your inner world like a laser, you can discover the 
most subtle aspects of your mind. Above all, yogic concentration ultimately 
enables you to discover your spiritual essence.
Concentration leads to meditation (which we discuss later in the chapter) 
and brings you clarity and peace of mind — two qualities that stand you in 
good stead in any situation. They enable you to live your life more fully, more 
meaningfully, and more competently. Whether you’re a busy mother and 
homemaker or a top executive, the mental tranquility you produce through 
regular concentration and meditation exercises can transform your entire day.
Gaining focus
Concentration and meditation are special moments in the same mindfulness 
that you’re asked to bring to every aspect of your life. The Sanskrit word for 
concentration is dharana, which means “holding.” You hold your attention 
by focusing on a specific bodily process (such as breathing), a thought, an 
image, or a sound (as we discuss in “Practicing Meditation” later in the chap-
ter). Through concentration, you seek to become concentric, or properly cen-
tered and harmonious with yourself. When you’re out of center (eccentric), or 
The inner limbs of Yoga
According to Raja Yoga, as described in 
the Yoga-Sutra of Patanjali, the yogic path 
comprises eight limbs (anga). The first five 
limbs — moral discipline, self-restraint, pos-
ture, breath control, and sensory inhibition — 
are called outer limbs. These practices belong 
to the entrance hall of Yoga’s vast mansion. In 
the interior of the estate you find concentration, 
meditation, and ecstasy, known as the inner 
limbs. You can successfully practice these 
inner limbs only after you achieve a certain 
degree of mastery in the other five practices.

310
Part IV: Yoga as a Lifestyle 
out of touch with your spiritual core, all your thoughts and actions are out of 
sync; they don’t flow from your innermost core and thus make you feel alien-
ated, uneasy, and unhappy.
You can determine whether you’re currently concentric or eccentric by check-
ing in with your body. How do you feel? How does a decision you’re about 
to make feel? How does a relationship feel? What does your body tell you 
about your present activity or your job? How do you feel about your life as a 
whole? This kind of mindfulness is called focusing, which means paying care-
ful attention to how your mind is registering in your body. Body and mind go 
together, so keeping mentally in touch with your body regularly is vital and 
even fundamental to good postural practice.
Through focusing, you can also become aware of your own baggage — old 
resentments, disappointments, fears, and expectations. People tend to store 
negative experiences in their bodies, which makes them predisposed to 
sickness. Sooner or later, each person needs to work through these stored 
memories for their own good health and to share their liberated selves with 
the world around them.
One way to begin replaying and diffusing negative experiences that are 
recorded in your body is to ask yourself, “Is anything preventing me from 
feeling good and happy right now? What, if anything, is keeping me from 
experiencing bliss?” Your body contains the answer(s): a sensation of tight-
ness in the chest, a hollow feeling around the heart, a contraction in the pit 
of your stomach, fearful pounding in the head — you get the idea. All these 
reactions are physical expressions of corresponding emotional states.
 
When doing this kind of focusing work, don’t settle for the first answer that 
comes to mind. Instead, ask yourself, “What else is there to prevent me from 
feeling good and happy?” If you encounter too much inner pain, you may want 
to consider doing this work in the company of a trusted friend or under the 
guidance of a competent counselor or therapist.
Practicing Meditation
Meditation is a mental process involving focused attention (also known as 
calm awareness or mindfulness). Many people confuse meditation with stop-
ping all thoughts, but that’s only one (rather advanced) type of meditation. In 
the beginning, meditation is simply noticing the endless stream of thoughts 
flickering on your mental screen; consider your observations an important 
part of your overall effort to be mindful, or attentive.

311
 Chapter 21: Meditation and the Higher Reaches of Yoga
Many forms or styles of meditation exist, but two basic approaches stand 
out: meditation with a specific focus and objectless meditation. The latter is 
pure mindfulness without narrowing attention to any particular sensation, 
idea, or other phenomenon. Most beginners find this kind of meditation very 
difficult, although some are drawn to it. We recommend that you start out 
with meditation on a specific focus. The following categories of objects are 
suitable for this exercise:
 
✓ A bodily sensation, such as breathing, which makes an excellent focus
 
✓ A bodily location, such as one of the seven cakras or energy centers we 
discuss in the next section
 
✓ A process or action, such as eating, walking, or washing dishes
 
✓ An external physical object, such as the flame of a candle
 
✓ A mantra (be it a single sound, a phrase, or a chant)
 
✓ A thought, such as the idea of peace, joy, love, or compassion
 
✓ A visualization of light, emptiness, a saint, or one of the many deities of 
Hindu or Buddhist Yoga
 
Experiment with all these various focal points for meditation until you find 
what appeals to you the most. Then stick with it. For instance, if you choose 
to visualize a particular saint or deity, you benefit by always using the same 
figure in your daily visualization practice.
The following sections give you more information on mastering meditation.
Getting a handle on cakras: 
Your wheels of fortune
If you choose to focus your meditation on a cakra (one of the options in the 
earlier list), you first need to understand the concept of cakras. According 
to Yoga, the physical body has a more subtle energetic counterpart that 
consists of a network of energy channels called nadis (pronounced nah-dees) 
through which the life force (prana) circulates. The most important chan-
nel, called the sushumna-nadi or “gracious channel,” runs along the axis of 
the body from the base of the spine to the crown of the head. In the ordinary 
individual, this central conduit of subtle energy is said to be mostly inactive. 
The purpose of many Hatha Yoga exercises is to clear this channel in particu-
lar of any obstructions, so that the life energy can flow freely in it, leading to 
better health and also higher states of consciousness.

312
Part IV: Yoga as a Lifestyle 
When the central channel is thus activated, it also sets the seven psychoen-
ergetic centers of the body in motion. These centers are the cakras (often 
spelled chakras in English), which are aligned along the central channel. The 
word means simply “wheel” and refers to the fact that these areas are whirl-
pools of energy that keep the physical body alive and functioning properly. In 
ascending order, the seven cakras are
 
✓ Muladhara (“root prop,” pronounced moo-lahd-hah-rah): Located at 
the base of the spine between the rectum and genitals, this center is the 
resting place of the dormant “serpent power,” the great psychospiritual 
energy that Hatha Yoga seeks to awaken. This center is connected with 
elimination as well as fear.
 
✓ Svadhishthana (“own place,” pronounced svahd-hisht-hah-nah): 
Located at the genitals, this center is connected with the urogenital 
functions but also with desire.
 
✓ Manipura (“jewel city,” pronounced mah-nee-poo-rah): Located at the 
navel, this center distributes the life force to all parts of the body and is 
especially involved in the digestive process as well as the willpower.
 
✓ Anahata (“unstruck,” pronounced ah-nah-hah-tah): Located in the 
middle of the chest, this center, which is also called the “heart cakra,” is 
the place where the “unstruck” or inner sound can be heard in medita-
tion. It’s also linked with love.
 
✓ Vishuddha (“pure,” pronounced vee-shood-hah): Located at the 
throat, this center is associated with speech as well as greed.
 
✓ Ajna (“command,” pronounced ah-gyah): Located in the middle of 
the head between the eyebrows, this center is the contact place for the 
guru’s telepathic work with disciples. It’s also associated with the experi-
ence of higher states of consciousness.
 
✓ Sahasrara (“thousand-spoked,” pronounced sah-hahs-rah-rah): 
Located at the crown of the head, this special cakra is associated with 
higher states of consciousness, notably the ecstatic state (which we 
cover in “Working toward Ecstasy” later in the chapter).
Following a few guidelines 
for successful meditation
 
Think of your meditation as a tree that you must water every day — not too 
much and not too little. Trust that one day your nurturing will bring the tree 
to bear beautiful blossoms and delicious fruit.

313
 Chapter 21: Meditation and the Higher Reaches of Yoga
Here are several vital tips to help you set the stage for a meditation routine:
 
✓ Practice regularly. Try to meditate every day. If that isn’t possible, med-
itate at least several times a week.
 
✓ Cultivate the correct motivation. People meditate for all kinds of rea-
sons: health, wholeness, peace of mind, clarity, spiritual growth, and so 
on. Be clear in your own mind why you’re sitting down to meditate. The 
best motivation for meditation (and Yoga practice in general) is to live to 
your full potential and to benefit others by your personal achievements.
 
 In Buddhism, this motivation is known as the bodhisattva ideal. The 
bodhisattva (“enlightenment being”) seeks to realize enlightenment (the 
ultimate spiritual state) for the benefit of all other beings. As an enlight-
ened being, you can be far more efficient in helping others in their own 
struggle for wholeness and happiness.
 
✓ Meditate at a regular time. Take advantage of the fact that your body-
mind is a creature of habit. After a few weeks of meditating at the same 
time during the day or night, you may find yourself looking forward 
to your next meditation session. Traditionally, Yoga practitioners 
prefer the hour of sunrise, but this time isn’t always practical. (Head to 
Chapter 18 for more on morning meditation.)
 
 Inevitably, you have moments when meditation is the last thing you 
want to do. In that case, resolve to sit quietly for at least five minutes. 
Often, this break is enough to get you in the mood for full-fledged medi-
tation. If not, don’t beat yourself over the head; just go on to something 
else and try again later or the next day.
 
✓ Meditate in the same place. Choose the same place for the same reason 
you use the same time: Your body-mind enjoys what is familiar. Use this 
fact to your advantage by setting aside a room or a corner of a room 
that your mind can associate with meditation.
 
✓ Select an appropriate posture for meditation and do it correctly. Sit 
up straight, with your chest open, and your neck free (see the follow-
ing section for instructions about posture). To avoid falling asleep, 
don’t recline while meditating and don’t meditate on your bed, even in 
a sitting position, because your mind is likely to associate the experi-
ence with sleep. If you’re not used to sitting on the floor, try sitting on 
a straight-backed chair or on a sofa with a cushion behind your back. 
If you can comfortably sit on the floor, you have a variety of yogic pos-
tures to choose from, several of which appear in Chapter 7.
 
✓ Select a meditation technique and stick with it. In the beginning, you 
may want to try out various techniques to see which appeals to you 
the most. But after you find a good technique for your particular needs, 
don’t abandon it until it bears fruit (in terms of increased peace of mind 
and happiness), a meditation teacher advises you to change to a differ-
ent technique, or you feel really drawn to a different technique.

314
Part IV: Yoga as a Lifestyle 
When you have your routine sorted out, keep the following suggestions in 
mind as you grow your meditation tree:
 
✓ Begin with short sessions. Meditate only 10 to 20 minutes at a time at first. If 
your meditation naturally lasts longer, simply rejoice in the fact. But never 
force yourself if the timing creates conflict or unhappiness in you. Also, 
beware of overmeditating. Often, what beginners regard as a nice long medi-
tation is just self-indulgent daydreaming. Make sure that your meditation con-
tains an element of alertness. When you start drifting off into a comfortable 
space, you can be sure that you’re no longer meditating. Like the practice 
of the Yoga postures, your meditation must have an edge (that is, you must 
push against the limitations of your mind but without frustrating yourself).
 
✓ Be alert, yet relaxed. Inner alertness, or mindfulness, isn’t the same as 
tension or stress. Cats are good examples of this alertness. Even when a 
cat is completely relaxed, its ears move around like radar dishes catching 
every little sound in the environment. The more relaxed you are, the more 
alert your mind can be, so make sure that your body is relaxed by regu-
larly practicing some of the relaxation exercises we describe in Chapter 4.
 
✓ Don’t burden yourself with expectations. Entering meditation with a desire 
to grow spiritually and to benefit from the experience is certainly accept-
able. However, don’t expect every meditation to be wonderful and pleasant.
 
✓ Prepare properly for meditation. As a beginner, don’t expect to be able 
to jump from the fray of your daily activities straight into meditation. 
Allow your mind a little time to unwind before you sit for meditation. 
Have a relaxing bath or shower or at least wash your face and hands.
 
✓ At the end of your meditation, integrate the experience with the rest 
of your life. Just as going straight from overdrive into a meditative gear 
isn’t prudent, you need to refrain from jumping up from meditation to 
return your other activities. Instead, make a conscious transition in and 
out of meditation. At the end of the session, briefly recall your reasons 
for meditating and your overall motivation. Be grateful for any energies 
and/or insights your meditation generates. Equally importantly, don’t 
feel negative about a difficult meditation experience. Rather, be grateful 
for any experience. Sometimes important insights surface during medita-
tion, and then your challenge is to translate these messages into daily 
life. When you continually perform this kind of integration, your medita-
tion deepens more quickly as well.
 
✓ Be prepared to practice meditation for a lifetime. You don’t grow a tree 
overnight. On the yogic path, no effort is ever wasted. Therefore, don’t give 
up if your meditation isn’t what you think it should be after a month or two. 
Don’t conclude too hastily that meditation isn’t working or that the tech-
nique you’re using isn’t effective. Instead, correct your understanding about 
the nature of meditation and carry on. Your very effort to meditate counts.
 
 Be wary of weekend workshops that promise immediate success, if not 
enlightenment itself. Meditation and enlightenment are lifelong processes.

315
 Chapter 21: Meditation and the Higher Reaches of Yoga
Maintaining proper bodily posture
 
Correct posture is important for meditation. Here’s a seven-point checklist 
that can help you develop good sitting habits:
 
✓ Back: Your back position is the single most important physical feature 
of your meditation. Your back should be straight but relaxed, with 
your chest open and your neck free. Correct posture enables your 
bodily energies to flow more freely, which prevents sleepiness. (Flip to 
“Understanding cakras: Your wheels of fortune” earlier in the chapter 
for details on the bodily energies.) Most Westerners need a firm cushion 
under their sits bones (the bones directly under the flesh of the but-
tocks) to encourage good posture during meditation and to stop their 
legs from going to sleep. If you go that route, however, make sure your 
pelvis doesn’t tilt forward too much. Alternatively, you can sit on a 
chair. Any posture is acceptable as long as you can comfortably main-
tain it for the desired duration.
 
✓ Head: For the correct position of your head, picture an attached string 
pulling the back of your head upward so that your head is tilted slightly 
forward. Too much of a forward tilt invites drowsiness, but not enough 
of a tilt can cause mental wandering.
 
✓ Tongue: Allow the front part of your tongue to touch the palate just 
behind the upper teeth. This position reduces the flow of saliva and 
the number of times you have to swallow, which many beginners find 
disturbing.
Roses come with thorns
If you’re a beginner and your meditations are 
consistently comfortable, you have every 
reason to be suspicious. The purpose of medi-
tation is to clear your mind, and doing so entails 
clearing away the debris (or what one teacher 
has called “the frogs deep down in the well”).
In the beginning, meditation consists largely of 
discovering just how unruly your mind is. If your 
meditation practice is successful, you encoun-
ter your shadow side (all those aspects of your 
character you’d prefer not to think about). 
As you go on, more profound insights into 
your character can and do occur, which then 
requires you to make the necessary changes in 
your attitudes and behaviors.
Few meditations are spectacular, which isn’t at 
all what meditation is about. Even a seemingly 
bad meditation is a good meditation because 
you’re applying mindfulness. Don’t be surprised 
to find that your meditation is calm and uplift-
ing one day and turbulent and distracted the 
next for no apparent reason. Until your mind 
reaches clarity and calmness, you can expect 
this fluctuation. Just keep a sense of humor and 
graciously accept whatever happens in your 
meditation.

316
Part IV: Yoga as a Lifestyle 
 
✓ Teeth: Don’t clench your teeth — keep your jaws relaxed. And be sure 
that your mouth doesn’t hang open either.
 
✓ Legs: If you can sit cross-legged for an extended period of time without 
experiencing discomfort, we especially recommend the perfect posture 
(siddhasana), which we describe in Chapter 6. The folded legs form a 
closed circuit, which aids your concentration. If sitting cross-legged is a 
problem for you, just meditate in a chair.
 
✓ Arms: Keep your hands cupped in your lap with your palms up and your 
right hand on top of your left. Relax your arms and shoulders, leaving a 
few inches between your arms and your trunk, which allows the air to 
circulate and prevents drowsiness.
 
✓ Eyes: Most beginners like to close their eyes, which is fine. As you 
develop your power of concentration, however, you may want to experi-
ment with keeping your eyes slightly open while gazing downward in front 
of you to signal your brain that you aren’t trying to go to sleep. Advanced 
practitioners are able to keep their eyes wide open without becoming dis-
tracted. In any event, make sure that your eye muscles are relaxed.
Overcoming obstacles to meditation
 
Whenever you deal with change, you also deal with resistance to change. 
Thus, the path of meditation is littered with various obstacles that can trip 
you up. Here are the most important potential hindrances: doubt (about the 
yogic path or yourself), negative thoughts (about yourself, others, life, and so 
on), haste, boredom, pretense, and hunting for spiritual experiences. The ego 
lurks in many niches, especially when you travel on the yogic path.
Adding sounds to meditation
Using a sound or phrase to focus the mind is a popular approach in many spiri-
tual traditions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity, Judaism, and Islamic 
Sufism. In Sanskrit, these special sounds are called mantras and are thought to 
help better focus attention. Mantra Yoga made its debut in the Western world in 
the late 1960s with the Transcendental Meditation (TM) movement, founded by 
Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, whose most famous disciples were The Beatles.
Here are some well-known mantras:
 
✓ The syllable om is composed of the letters a, u, and m, and stands for 
the waking state, dream state, and deep sleep respectively. Hindus 
consider this syllable to be sacred and to symbolize the ultimate real-
ity, or higher Self (atman). The sound begins from the belly and moves 
upward; the long-drawn, nasalized humming sound of m represents the 
ultimate reality.

317
 Chapter 21: Meditation and the Higher Reaches of Yoga
 
✓ The mantra so’ham (pronounced so-hum) means “I am He,” that is, “I am 
the universal Self.” You repeat it in sync with breathing: so on inhaling 
and ham on exhaling.
 
✓ Buddhist Yoga widely uses the mantric phrase om mani padme hum 
(pronounced om mah-nee pahd-meh hoom). It means “Om. Jewel in the 
Lotus. Hum,” which conveys that the searched-for higher reality is pres-
ent here and now.
 
✓ The mantric utterance om namah shivaya (pronounced om nah-mah 
shee-vah-yah) is a favorite phrase among Hindu devotees of the Divine in 
the form of Shiva. It means “Om. Salutation to Shiva.”
 
✓ The mantric utterance hare krishna (pronounced hah-reh krish-nah) was 
made famous in the West by the members of the Krishna Consciousness 
movement. It invokes the Divine in the form of Krishna, who is also 
called Hari.
 
According to the Yoga tradition, sounds are considered mantras only after a 
guru passes the sound to a worthy disciple. Thus, the syllable om on its own — 
without proper initiation — isn’t a mantra. Many Western Yoga teachers take 
a more relaxed approach and recommend both traditional and contemporary 
words for mantra practice.
Reciting your mantra
Whether you choose your own mantra or are given one, you must repeat it 
over and over again, either mentally or vocally (whispered or aloud), in order 
to make it effective.
This practice of recitation is called japa (pronounced jah-pah), meaning 
“muttering.” So, what happens after you recite a mantra a thousand, ten 
thousand, or a hundred thousand times? As you repeat the sound, your 
attention becomes more and more focused and your consciousness becomes 
absorbed into the sound. The mantra begins to recite itself, serving as an 
anchor for your mind whenever you don’t need to engage your thoughts in 
specific tasks. This shift simplifies your inner life and gives you a sense of 
peace. Ultimately, your mantra can guide you to enlightenment. Of course, 
to achieve enlightenment you must fulfill the other requirements of Yoga 
as well, notably honoring the moral disciplines, which we cover in detail in 
Chapter 18. We also discuss the road to enlightenment further in “Reaching 
toward Enlightenment” later in this chapter.
 
We recommend that beginners recite their mantra aloud, at a slow, steady 
pace. After you have some experience with this form of meditation, you can 
begin to whisper your mantra so that only you can hear it. Traditionally, the 
most powerful form of mantric recitation is silent or mental recitation. This 
exercise, however, calls for a certain degree of skill in maintaining your con-
centration, so start with a vocal mantra.

318
Part IV: Yoga as a Lifestyle 
Using a rosary
Yoga practitioners often tell rosary beads while reciting their mantras — a 
practice that helps focus the mind. The typical rosary (mala) consists of 108 
beads plus an extra-large bead that represents the cosmic mountain Meru. 
You tell the beads by using the thumb and middle finger. Your fingers should 
not cross the master or Meru bead. After 108 recitations (or beads), you 
simply turn the rosary around and start counting over again.
Breathing mindfully
Mindful observation of the breath is a meditation exercise, taught particu-
larly in Buddhist circles, that any beginner can try. As we note in Chapter 5, 
the breath is the link between body and mind and since ancient times, the 
Yoga masters have made good use of this connection. Mindful breathing, or 
breathing meditation, is a simple and effective way of exploring the calming 
effect of conscious breathing. Here’s how it works:
 
1. Sit up straight and relaxed.
 
2. Remind yourself of your purpose for meditation and resolve to sit in 
meditation for a given period of time.
 
 We recommend at least 5 minutes for this exercise. Gradually extend the 
duration.
 
3. Close your eyes or keep them half open while looking down in front 
of you.
 
4. Breathing normally and gently, focus your attention on the sensation 
created by the breath flowing in and out of your nostrils.
 
 Carefully observe the entire process of inhalation and exhalation as it 
occurs at the opening of your nostrils.
 
5. To prevent your mind from wandering, you can count in inhalation/
exhalation breath cycles from 1 to 10.
Note: Don’t be concerned if you notice that your attention has wandered. 
Especially, don’t be judgmental about any thoughts that may pop into your 
head. Instead, rededicate yourself to the process of observing your breath.
Walking meditation
Mindfulness is possible in any circumstance. You can eat, drive, wash dishes, 
have a conversation, watch television, or make love mindfully. For beginners, 
mindfulness while walking is an excellent form of meditation. Just follow 
these steps to get started:

319
 Chapter 21: Meditation and the Higher Reaches of Yoga
 
1. Remind yourself of your purpose for meditation and resolve to medi-
tate for a given period of time.
 
 For a first try, we recommend at least 5 minutes for this exercise.
 
2. Keep your eyes open but unfocused, looking down and a few steps 
ahead of you.
 
 Don’t lower your head, but keep your neck relaxed.
 
3. Stand completely still and feel your entire body.
 
4. Focus your attention on your right foot, especially the toes and sole.
 
5. Slowly raise your right foot and take the first step.
 
 Feel the sensation of the pressure lifting from your right foot and leg and 
shifting over to your left leg.
 
6. As you slowly place the right foot back on the ground, become aware 
of the contact between your sole and the ground.
 
 Also notice the rest of your body: your swinging arms that keep you bal-
anced, your neck and head, your pelvis.
 
7. Acknowledge any thoughts that arise without being judgmental; return 
your attention to your whole body, not merely on one limb or movement.
 
8. At the end of your walking meditation, stand completely still for a few 
seconds, observing the clarity and calmness within you.
Working toward Ecstasy
When you start meditating, you’re well aware that “you” — the subject — are 
quite different from the object of meditation. You experience the white or 
blue light or the visualized deity as distinct from yourself. But as meditation 
deepens, the boundary between subject and object — consciousness and its 
contents — becomes increasingly blurred. Then, at one point, the two merge 
completely. You’re the light or deity. This point is the celebrated state of 
ecstasy called samadhi in Sanskrit (pronounced sah-mahd-hee).
Associating prayer with meditation
A close relationship exists between medita-
tion and prayer. Prayer practices mindfulness 
in relationship to a being — whether that be a 
guru, a great master (dead or alive), a deity, or 
the ultimate spiritual reality itself — deemed 
“higher” than the participant. Prayer, like medi-
tation, involves a feeling of reverence.

320
Part IV: Yoga as a Lifestyle 
Yoga distinguishes two fundamental types or levels of ecstasy. At the lower 
level, the ecstatic state is associated with a certain form or mental content. 
The higher type of ecstasy is a state of formless consciousness.
Many Yoga practitioners never experience the ecstatic state, but some defi-
nitely encounter it in the course of their lives. What matters isn’t how often 
or how long you enter into samadhi but whether and how much you embody 
spiritual principles in your daily life. Are you compassionate and kind? Do 
you see others not as total strangers but fellow beings going through their 
own struggle of Self-realization? Can you love unconditionally? Are you forgiv-
ing and encouraging toward others?
 
Samadhi isn’t identical with enlightenment, which is the real goal of Yoga. You 
can attain enlightenment without ever experiencing samadhi. The following 
section enlightens you about the state of enlightenment.
Reaching toward Enlightenment
People usually associate the word enlightenment with profound intellectual 
understanding. However, in Yoga, enlightenment refers to the permanent 
realization of your true nature, which is the ultimate or transcendental Self 
(atman). The Sanskrit word for enlightenment is bodha (pronounced bohd-
ha), which means “illumination.” The same realization also is referred to as 
liberation because it liberates you from the misunderstanding that you’re a 
separate self, referred to as I in a unique body and gifted with a mind that is 
disconnected from everything else.
Wherever you go, there you are
Sri Ramana Maharshi was one of the great 
Yoga masters of the 20th century. When, as he 
was on his deathbed, his disciples expressed 
their sorrow at losing him, he calmly said, “They 
say that I am dying, but I am not going away. 
Where could I go? I am here.” He had realized 
the eternal Self, which is everywhere. To this 
day, his spiritual presence can be felt in the 
hermitage that disciples built for him long ago.

▶ Understanding Yoga therapy
▶ Following a five-step plan to keep your back shipshape
▶ Trying Yoga routines for lower backs and upper backs/necks
Yoga therapy applies the principles of Yoga to people with physical, psy-
chological, or spiritual needs not normally met in a group class. A Yoga 
therapist is a Yoga teacher with advanced training who can adapt Yoga to the 
client’s unique needs. The regular and mindful practice of carefully adapted 
Yoga postures can bring relief from pain, increase mobility and strength, and 
confer a sense of well-being.
This chapter introduces you to the field of Yoga therapy, helps you make 
informed decisions about whether Yoga therapy may be right for you, and 
shows you what to look for in a Yoga therapist. If your back is calling for 
more TLC (but not crying out for a doctor — if you’re in acute pain, see your 
medical professional), the suggestions and postures in this chapter can help 
you become more aware of your needs and make peace with your back.
What You Need to Know 
about Yoga Therapy
If you have ever suffered from a back problem, you aren’t alone. More 
than 80 percent of Americans seek professional help for back pain at some 
point in their lives, and back pain is second only to the common cold for 
illness-related absences from work. Back-health experts recommend that 
people learn how to prevent pain and self-treat in situations where they can 
safely do so.

322
Part IV: Yoga as a Lifestyle 
Yoga therapy helps people in the chronic or rehabilitation stage of their pain 
(after the acute stage has passed) and is generally an adjunct to medical and/
or chiropractic care. Acute pain is the body’s distress signal and shouldn’t 
be ignored. What may feel like a musculoskeletal pain may in fact be a seri-
ous medical problem involving an organ, or a pinched nerve requiring spinal 
adjustment. People with acute pain should seek help from a medical, chiro-
practic, or osteopathic physician or physical therapist.
In addition to its most common use with back problems, Yoga therapy is 
helpful with knee and hip problems, arthritis, and carpal tunnel syndrome. 
It can also benefit those who suffer from a host of other conditions: heart 
disease, hypertension, insomnia, painful menstrual periods and hot flashes, 
depression, anxiety, headaches, diabetes, digestive problems, chronic pain, 
Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and more. Though not a cure, Yoga 
therapy can help improve the quality of life for people living with serious 
chronic and progressive conditions.
If you think you may be a candidate for Yoga therapy, the next step is to find 
a qualified Yoga therapist who can meet your needs. The following sections 
help you with that search and also clue you in as to what you can expect 
from Yoga therapy.
Everything old is new again: The evolution 
of Yoga as therapy
The therapeutic use of Yoga dates back over 
thousands of years as a component of ayurveda. 
Ayurveda (ayus meaning “life” and veda mean-
ing “related to knowledge or science”) is an 
Indian system of medicine with ancient roots 
that is becoming well known in the West as well. 
It has a strong focus on disease prevention and 
takes a whole-person approach. Yoga therapy 
came into its own in India in the early part of 
the 20th century. Sri T. Krishnamacacharya, 
teacher to T.K.V. Desikachar, B.K.S. Iyengar, 
and Pattabhi Jois, used his own blend of 
Yoga and ayurveda. The Kaivalyadhama 
Yoga Hospitalin Lonovola (www.kdham.
com) and the Yoga Institute of Santacruz, 
Mumbai (www.theyogainstitute.
org), both started almost a century ago and 
still operate today.
Yoga therapy has continued to develop in 
the United States, sometimes combined with 
ayurveda but increasingly utilized as a com-
plement to Western-style integrative medi-
cine. Early pioneers in the field include Dean 
Ornish, MD; Nischala Devi; Judith Lasater, PT; 
Gary Kraftsow, MA; your humble coauthors 
Georg Feuerstein, PhD and Larry Payne, PhD; 
Michael Lee; Richard Miller, PhD; and Makunda 
Stiles. Founded in 1989 by Richard Miller and 
me (Larry), the International Association of 
Yoga Therapists (www.iayt.org) supports 
research and education in Yoga and serves as 
a professional organization for upward of 2,600 
Yoga therapists and teachers worldwide.

How to find a good yoga therapist
Finding a good Yoga therapist who fits your needs takes a bit of research. 
Following are some tips that should help you in you in your search:
 
✓ Find out where the Yoga therapist has received training. Look for 
someone who has successfully completed a respected training program. 
The Yoga Therapy Rx training program at Loyola Marymount University 
in Los Angeles is the first of what is sure to become many university-
based programs to prepare Yoga teachers to apply the tools of Yoga to 
bring relief and improvement. We also list other highly respected non-
university programs, some with specific specialties in the appendix.
 
✓ Ask a trusted source. Yoga therapists work with a range of health care 
practitioners. Ask your practitioner for a referral.
 
✓ Visit the Web site of a respected training program. Many training pro-
grams publish the names and contact information of therapists they 
have trained. While at the site, you can explore the training course 
descriptions and evaluate their appropriateness for your needs.
What to expect if you see a Yoga therapist
Visiting any new practitioner can make a person uneasy, so in this section, 
we guide you be an informed patient, discussing the Yoga therapy approach 
to healing as well as treatment length and cost.
A whole-person approach
Yoga therapy takes the whole person into account. Although your chief com-
plaint may be your achin’ lower back, in the course of the assessment your 
Yoga therapist may observe, ask about, and consider related factors beyond 
your tense muscles: how and how much you move and sit during the course 
of your typical day; your general level of stress (without becoming your psy-
chotherapist); how you breathe; your typical diet and sleep patterns; and so 
on. In addition to an individualized program of coordinated movement and 
breath, your Yoga therapist may suggest journaling to help you learn more 
about your lifestyle and pain triggers as well as modifications in your daily 
routine to help you meet your goal.
An initial series of sessions, and beyond
About six sessions are generally helpful when working with a Yoga therapist. 
This duration allows time for you to get a handle on your personalized pro-
gram, and for your Yoga therapist to observe and adjust your movements 
and breath so that you have a program that works for you.

324
Part IV: Yoga as a Lifestyle 
The goal is to develop a personal practice that you can continue on your own 
for continued improvement in mobility, strength, and well-being so that you 
can eventually participate in group classes if you want to. Periodic tune-ups 
are a good idea, especially if you aren’t participating in a group class where a 
skilled Yoga teacher can help you modify postures as necessary.
Cost
As you may expect, private sessions with someone who has advanced train-
ing cost more than what you’d pay for a group Yoga class. Individual sessions 
in large metropolitan areas range from about $75 to $200 each depending on 
the experience of the therapist.
Five-Step Plan for a Healthy Back
The best way to prevent back problems or to keep them from becoming 
chronic is to use Yoga as part of a five-step plan, which we outline here.
 
✓ Re-educate yourself on biomechanics: How you sit, stand, walk, lift, 
sleep, and work can cause you pain or help you relieve pain.
 
✓ Practice your Yoga or back exercise program regularly: Be realistic 
about how much you can do each day, and do it.
 
✓ Keep a back journal: Journaling can help you discover more about 
how your lifestyle (such as sleeping, lifting, and sitting habits) affects 
your back.
 
✓ Make healthful food choices: Nutrition experts recommend a balanced 
diet rich in fruits and vegetables, whole grains, legumes, low fat dairy 
products, fish, and limited amounts of lean meat, if meat is eaten.
 
✓ Rest and relax consciously: Be mindful about what you expose yourself 
to in the hours before bedtime. The last thing you see or listen to before 
bed affects your subconscious mind and can affect your sleep pattern.
Yoga Rx for Lower Backs
Your “lower back” is actually the lumbar vertebrae section of the spinal cord. 
Spine movement brings much-needed circulation to the vertebral discs and 
helps keep them supple. The health of your hamstring and psoas (hip flexor) 
muscles as well as the strength of your abdominal and core muscles also 
affects your lower back. Helpful Yoga therapy postures allow you to stretch 
and strengthen key muscle groups, release tension and bring your whole 
body back into harmony. The following sections give you some general guide-
lines on what kinds of Yoga movements work well for different lower back 
issues, and a routine to help you segue into a regular group class.

Lower back conditions that 
need more arching
If a forward bend or rounding is very painful to your lower back, chances are 
you may have strained your lower back muscles or may have a disc problem 
or sciatica. So, be wise, and if it hurts, don’t do it! Here are some tips:
 
✓ Avoid forward bends of any kind. If you try a forward bend, keep your 
back flat and not rounded. Remember the concept of Forgiving Limbs 
(which we cover in Chapter 3) and bend your knees as necessary.
 
✓ Try postures that allow you to arch, such as those in the cobra family 
(see Chapter 11), rather than bend forward. Gentle extensions such 
as transitioning to warrior I from the mountain posture are also helpful. 
(Check out Chapter 7 for warrior I and mountain posture.)
 
✓ Use the “Lower back routine” later in this section. You can also find 
DVD resources in the appendix.
Lower back conditions 
that need more folding
A number of back conditions, including arthritis and spondylolisthesis 
(slipped vertebrae), can cause the vertebrae to jam, making arching very 
painful. As we stress in the preceding section, if it hurts, don’t do it. The fol-
lowing list gives you some pointers on Yoga for these conditions:
 
✓ Avoid postures that extend your back, such as those in the cobra family, 
and athletic postures or sequences that involve jumping.
 
✓ Try postures that lengthen your back, such as gentle forward bends, 
downward-facing dog, and folding cat. (Flip to Chapter 7 for more 
suggestions.)
What about scoliosis?
Scoliosis, a condition where the spine curves 
from side to side, can be structural or func-
tional. If you feel you have scoliosis, consult 
with your medical or chiropractic physician.
 ✓ Structural scoliosis is a hereditary disorder 
more common in girls than boys.
 ✓ Functional scoliosis may occur as a result of 
a problem elsewhere in the body, such as one 
leg being shorter than the other, or even as 
a result of very frequent holding of a position 
that causes a twist in the spine. Postures that 
stretch out one side of the spine at a time, 
such as asymmetrical (one-sided) forward 
bends, side bends, and twists are generally 
helpful and may reduce or eliminate the curve 
in time. (Chapters 11 and 12 give you more info 
on postures that bend and twist.)

326
Part IV: Yoga as a Lifestyle 
Lower back routine
 
The following exercises aren’t meant for acute back problems. If any part of 
this routine causes you back or neck pain, omit that part and check with your 
medical or chiropractic physician before you continue.
 
A session or two of Yoga or back exercise during your week doesn’t help 
much if you misuse or abuse your back the rest of the time.
No single Yoga routine is appropriate for all back problems. When your 
doctor feels that you’re ready for a regular group class, the following routine 
can help you make the transition. Keep in mind that the Yoga breathing we 
recommend for this routine (Chapter 5’s focus breathing or belly breathing) 
is just as important as the Yoga postures. Inhale and exhale slowly through 
your nose, with a slight pause after both the inhalation and the exhalation. 
We give you various options for many of the postures so that you can find 
the moves that are right for you. And remember that executing the postures 
in the proper sequence is very important.
Corpse posture with bent legs: Shavasana variation
Relaxation and breathing are important ingredients for a healthy back. The 
corpse posture is a classic position to start the process.
 
If your back feels uncomfortable, place a pillow or blanket roll under your knees. 
If your head tilts back, place a folded blanket or small pillow under your head.
 
1. Lie flat on your back with your arms relaxed along the sides of your 
torso and your palms up.
 
2. Bend your knees and place your feet on the floor at hip width.
 
3. Close your eyes and relax (see Figure 22-1).
 
4. Stay in the posture for 8 to 10 breaths.

 Chapter 22: Yoga Therapy: The (Yoga) Doctor Will See You Now
Knee-to-chest posture: Ekapada apanasana
Keeping your back healthy is like tuning a piano. The knee-to-chest posture 
helps you adjust and relax your lower back. If you have knee problems, hold 
the back of your thigh instead of just below your knee. Remember, this pose 
isn’t a biceps exercise. Just hold your knee, breathe, and relax.
 
1. Lie on your back with your knees bent palms down and feet flat on 
the floor.
 
2. As you exhale, bring your right knee toward your chest, holding your 
shin just below your knee as in Figure 22-2.
 
3. Stay in the posture for six to eight breaths.
 
4. Repeat Steps 1 through 3 with your left leg.
 
Figure 22-2: 
Knee-
to-chest 
posture.
 
Lying arm raise with bent leg: Shavasana variation
Many back sufferers have more problems on one side of the torso than the 
other. The lying arm raise is a safe, classic way to gently stretch and prepare 
each side of the back and neck for the rest of the routine.
 
1. Lie in the corpse posture (found in Chapter 14) with your arms 
relaxed at your sides and palms down; bend just your left knee, and 
put your left foot on the floor as shown in Figure 22-3a.
 
2. As you inhale, slowly raise your arms overhead and touch the floor 
behind you with your palms up as Figure 22-3b illustrates; pause briefly.
 
3. As you exhale, bring your arms back to your sides as in Step 1.
 
4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 six to eight times and then repeat Steps 1 
through 3 with your right knee bent and your left leg straight.

Push-downs I: Urdhva prasrta padasana I
Note: We recommend that you start with this posture and replace it with 
push-downs II (in the following section) when you’re ready to advance.
The abdomen is considered the front of your back (see Chapter 9). Keep this 
key area strong and toned if you want to prevent back problems. The push-
downs are a great way to get that party started because they strengthen your 
abs without involving your neck and improve your core strength.
 
1. Lying on your back with your knees bent and your feet on the floor at 
hip width, rest your arms near your sides with your palms down.
 
2. As you exhale, push your lower back down to the floor for 3 to 5 sec-
onds as demonstrated in Figure 22-4 and then inhale.
 
 As you inhale, your back releases from the push down.
 
3. Repeat Step 2 six to eight times.
 
Figure 22-4: 
Push-
downs I.
 
Push-downs II: Urdhva prasrta padasana II
 
When you’re ready for push-downs II (the advanced version of push-downs I 
in the preceding section), move your bent leg very slowly. Resist the tempta-
tion to speed up.
 
1. Lying on your back with your knees bent and your feet on the floor at 
hip width, rest your arms near your sides with your palms down.

329
 Chapter 22: Yoga Therapy: The (Yoga) Doctor Will See You Now
 
2. As you inhale, draw your right bent knee in toward your chest, keep-
ing your palms on the floor as in Figure 22-5.
 
3. As you exhale, push your lower back down to the floor, moving your 
bent right leg down until your right foot returns to touch the floor.
 
 Repeat Steps 2 and 3 six to eight times, alternating slowly with right and 
left legs.
 
Figure 22-5: 
Push-
downs II.
 
 
To make push-downs II more challenging, draw both bent knees in toward 
your chest on the inhalation and then push your lower back into the floor as 
you bring both of your feet back to the floor on the exhalation. Be sure to keep 
both hands palms down on the floor the whole time.
Dynamic bridge: Dvipada pitham
The gentle action of the bridge compensates the abs and relaxes the back for 
the hamstring stretch in the following section. (Head to Chapter 15 for more 
on sequencing and compensation.)
 
1. Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor at hip 
width.
 
2. Place your arms at your sides with your palms down.
 
3. As you inhale, raise your hips to a comfortable height as demon-
strated in Figure 22-6.
 
4. As you exhale, return your hips to the floor.
 
 Repeat Steps 3 and 4 six to eight times.
 
Try just tilting your pelvis towards your chin as you exhale if the bridge 
causes any problems, and then try the bridge again later when you’re ready.

Hamstring stretch: Supta padangustasana variation
Tight hamstring muscles are a key factor in many cases of chronic back 
problems. A fine balance exists between stretching your hamstrings and not 
aggravating a chronic back condition. For this reason, we recommend keep-
ing one leg bent with the foot on the floor to support your back.
 
1. Lying on your back with your legs straight, place your arms along 
your sides with your palms down.
 
2. Bend just your left knee and put your left foot on the floor as in 
Figure 22-7a.
 
3. As you exhale, raise your right leg until it’s perpendicular to the floor 
(or as close as you can manage).
 
4. As you inhale, return your leg to the floor, keeping your head and the 
top of your hips on the floor.
 
 Repeat Steps 1 through 4 three to four times, and then hold the back of 
your raised thigh in place just below your knee for 6 to 8 breaths as in 
Figure 22-7b.
 
5. Repeat Steps 1 through 4 on the other side with your right knee bent 
and your left leg straight.
 
 Make sure you feel the stretch in your hamstrings, not in your back.
 
If the back of your neck or your throat tenses when you raise or lower your 
leg, rest your head on a pillow or folded blanket.

Balancing cat: Chakravakasana variation I
This posture has been proven to strengthen core muscles throughout the 
spine, making it a great back exercise.
 
1. Starting on your hands and knees, position your knees about hip 
width and your hands just below your shoulders with your fingers 
turned forward and your arms straightened as Figure 22-8a illustrates.
 
2. As you exhale, slide your right hand forward and your left leg back, 
keeping your hand and your toes on the floor.
 
3. As you inhale, raise your right arm and left leg to a comfortable 
height as in Figure 22-8b.
 
4. Stay in Step 3 for 6 to 8 breaths and then repeat Steps 1 through 3 
with opposite pairs (left arm and right leg).

Child’s posture with arms in front: Balasana variation I
If you listen for feedback from your body after doing a number of back bends, 
you hear a clear desire to fold as compensation (which we cover in Chap-
ter 15). The child’s posture is a smooth and easy way to fold when you’re 
concluding hands and knees postures or front-lying back bends. The arms-in-
front variation here distributes the stretch along the upper and lower back.
 
1. Starting on your hands and knees, place your knees about hip width 
with your hands just below your shoulders and your elbows straight 
but not locked.
 
2. As you exhale, sit back on your heels, rest your torso on your thighs, 
and place your forehead on the floor.
 
3. Lay your arms on the floor outstretched comfortably in front of you 
with your palms down as Figure 22-9 indicates.
 
 Close your eyes and breathe easily. Stay for 6 to 8 breaths.
 
Figure 22-9: 
Child’s 
posture 
variation.
 
 
You can also try the regular child’s posture with your arms back near your 
hips with your palms up and hands on the floor. You may feel a little more 
stretch in your lower back, so choose the one that’s most comfortable in the 
moment.
 
If you have knee or hip problems, lie on your back and do the knees-to-chest 
posture we cover later in this routine rather than the child’s posture.
Half warrior: Ardha virabhadrasana variation
This posture stretches your main hip flexors (the iliopsoas), one of the key 
muscle groups for maintaining a healthy lower back.
 
1. Start standing on your knees at hip width and then take a big step for-
ward with the right foot, keeping your left knee on the ground; square 
your hips forward and place your hands on your right thigh, fingers 
forward just above your knee as shown in Figure 22-10a.

333
 Chapter 22: Yoga Therapy: The (Yoga) Doctor Will See You Now
 
2. As you exhale, sink your hips forward and down as Figure 22-10b 
demonstrates.
 
 Be sure to keep approximately a 90-degree angle with your forward leg.
 
3. As you inhale return to the starting position in Step 1.
 
4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 three to four times and then stay in Step 2 for six 
to eight breaths.
 
5. Repeat Steps 1 through 4 the same sequence on the left side.

Cobra II: Bhujangasana
Note: We recommend that you use either this posture or the cobra I posture 
in the following section, not both. Cobra I is less strenuous than cobra II, so 
go with cobra I if you aren’t sure. Flip to Chapter 11 for further clarification.
As we explain in Chapter 11, most folks simply do too much forward bending. 
Finding a way to compensate with some form of back bend is important.
 
1. Lie on your abdomen, with your legs at hip width and the tops of your 
feet on the floor.
 
 You can also separate your legs further and roll your heels outward and 
toes inward.
 
2. Bend your elbows and place your palms on the floor with your 
thumbs near your armpits.
 
 Rest your forehead on the floor and relax your shoulders (see 
Figure 22-11a).
 
3. As you inhale, press your palms against the floor and lift your chest 
and head forward and up (like a turtle coming out of its shell), keep-
ing your buttocks loose.

334
Part IV: Yoga as a Lifestyle 
 
4. Look straight ahead as shown in Figure 22-11b.
 
 Keep the top front of your pelvis on the floor and your shoulders 
relaxed. Unless you’re very flexible, keep your elbows slightly bent and 
roll them inward toward your trunk.
 
5. As you exhale, lower your torso and head slowly back to the floor.
 
 Repeat Steps 3 through 5 six to eight times.

Move slowly and cautiously in all of the cobra-like postures. Avoid any of the 
postures that cause pain in your lower back, upper back, or neck. If cobra II is 
too strenuous, use cobra I, which appears in the following section, or repeat 
the lying arm raise, which we cover earlier in this chapter.
Cobra I: Sphinx
Note: We recommend that you use either this posture or the cobra posture in 
the preceding section, not both. Cobra I is less strenuous than cobra II, so go 
with cobra I if you aren’t sure.
 
If the cobra postures aggravate your lower back, separate your legs wider 
than your hips and turn your heels out with your toes inward. Also, if you 
move your hands further forward, these postures are less difficult.
 
1. Lie on your abdomen with your legs at hip width and the tops of the 
feet on the floor.
 
2. Rest your forehead on the floor and relax your shoulders.
 
 Bend your elbows and place your forearms on the floor with your palms 
turned down and positioned near the sides of your head.
 
3. As you inhale, engage your back muscles, press your forearms against 
the floor, and raise your chest and head as in Figure 22-12.
 
 Look straight ahead and keep your forearms and the front of your pelvis 
on the floor. Continue to relax your shoulders.

Prone resting posture Advasana variation
Resting at the right times is an important part of a Yoga sequence, and back

Yoga should never feel like you’re in a hurry.
 
1. Lie on your abdomen with your legs at hip width and the tops of your 
feet on the floor.
 
2. Rest your forehead on the floor or turn your head to one side and 
relax your shoulders.
 
 Bend your elbows and place your forearms on the floor with your palms

Locust I: Shalabhasana
The cobra postures in the preceding sections work primarily to stretch your 
back and restore its natural curves, but the locust posture works more on 
strengthening your back. Both are important to your back health.
 
1. Lie on your abdomen with your legs at hip width and the tops of your 
feet on the floor.
 
 Rest your forehead on the floor.
 
2. Extend your arms back along the sides of your torso with your palms 
on the floor.
 
3. As you inhale, raise your chest, head, and right leg as illustrated in 
Figure 22-14.
 
4. As you exhale, lower your torso and head slowly to the floor.
 
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 three times and then stay in Step 3 (the last 
raised position) for 6 to 8 breaths.
 
6. Repeat Steps 1 through 5 with your left leg.

The butterfly: Jathara parvritti variation I
Back pain sufferers often forget that the lower and upper back are very con-
nected. Often, an upper back twist like the butterfly has a safe ripple effect all 
the way down when a lower back twist isn’t possible.
 
If you’re having a disc-related problem, be very careful of twists for both the 
upper and lower back. If you have any negative symptoms, such as pain or 
numbness, leave the twist out and speak to your physician before adding it 
back into your program.
 
1. Lie on your left side with your knees bent, arms extended parallel not 
higher than your shoulders and join your palms together on the floor 
as Figure 22-16a illustrates.
 
 Place pillows or folded blankets under your head and between your 
knees for stability.
 
2. As you inhale, raise your right hand up and over, turning your head 
to follow your hand until it touches the floor on the other side as in 
Figure 22-16b.
 
 Don’t force it! Only move your hand and head as far as it can comfort-
ably go.
 
3. As you exhale, return to the starting position in Step 1.
 
4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 four to six times.
 
5. Repeat Steps 1 through 4 on the right side.

Bent-leg supine twist variation: Jathara parvritti variation II
A good back routine often includes both an upper and a lower back twist. 
The bent-leg supine twist variation is appropriate here because it’s easy to 
execute. We offer you a number of other effective twists in Chapter 12.
 
If you’re having a disc-related problem, be very careful of twists. If you have 
any negative symptoms, such as pain or numbness, leave the twist out and 
speak to your physician before adding it back to your program.
 
1. Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet on the floor at hip 
width; extend your arms out from your sides like a T, with your palms 
down and in line with the top of your shoulders.
 
2. As you exhale, cross your right leg over your left leg, slowly lower 
your bent legs to the left side and then turn your head to the right as 
shown in Figure 22-17.
 
 Keep your head on the floor.
 
3. As you inhale, bring your bent knees back up to the middle; as you 
exhale, slowly lower them back down to the same side.
 
4. Repeat Steps 1 through 3 three times and then stay down on the left 
side for 4 to 6 breaths.
 
5. Repeat Steps 1 through 4 with the left leg on top to the right side.
 
If the cross-over twist variation is too difficult, try this same twist with the legs 
uncrossed and both feet on the ground.

Knees-to-chest posture: Apanasana
One of the rules of sequencing (which we cover in Chapter 15) is to always follow 
a twist with some kind of forward bend. Knees-to-chest is a classic forward bend 
to use when the posture preceding it is a floor twist, as in this back routine.
 
1. Lie on your back and bend your knees in toward your chest.
 
2. Hold your shins just below your knees (see Figure 22-18a).
 
3. As you exhale, draw your knees inward, closer to your chest as dem-
onstrated in Figure 22-18b.
 
4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 three to four times and then relax and breathe, 
holding your shins for 6 to 8 breaths.
 
 If you have any knee problems, hold the backs of your thighs instead.

Corpse posture with bent legs, repeated
When you come to the end of our back routine, the corpse posture variation 
we discuss at the beginning of the routine gives you a stable position to focus 
on your breathing and deeply relax your back. You don’t want to skip this 
part. Stay in this posture for 25 to 30 breaths, making your exhalation slightly 
longer than your inhalation.
 
Covering your eyes can give a deeper relaxation effect. Use an eye bag or a 
scarf to cover your eyes to see whether you like it. (You can read more on eye 
bags and other props in Chapter 19.) Placing your feet comfortably up on a 
chair or a bed also adds a very calming effect and improves the circulation in 
your legs. It can even help improve your sleep.
Yoga Rx for Upper Backs and Necks
If you experience discomfort or limited movement in your upper back or 
neck, chances are your posture and possibly stress are contributing to the 
situation. This section helps you avoid those problems and gives you an 
upper back-friendly Yoga routine.
Do’s and don’ts
The following list gives you some tips on what you can usually do to help 
your upper back and neck issues:
 
✓ Aim to perfect your mountain posture (see Chapter 7) and apply those 
lessons to your posture off the mat in your daily life.
 
✓ Discover how to let go of your tension with the relaxation techniques in 
Chapter 4. Becoming a student of Chapter 5’s yogic breathing can also 
help you let go.
 
✓ Use the routine in the following section. You can also find DVD 
resources in the appendix.
Some actions can exacerbate your problems. Here are some things to avoid:
 
✓ No matter how much you may want to look like the models in many 
Yoga magazines, the headstand or full shoulder stand isn’t for you. You 
can safely explore a world full of other postures.
 
✓ Avoid any neck routines that recommend full circles of the neck. This 
movement can cause serious problems, especially if you have a history 
of neck problems.

Upper back routine
 
This routine isn’t for anyone in acute pain, and we don’t recommend it for people 
experiencing numbness, tingling, or weakness in their neck, shoulders, or arms.
Seated chair posture
This posture is the base for the entire upper back routine, so make sure you 
understand how to sit in a way that feels steady and comfortable.
 
1. Sit comfortably in an armless chair with your back up nice and tall; 
place your palms comfortably on your thighs.
 
2. Look straight ahead and bring your head comfortably back until the 
middle of your ears, your shoulders, and your hip sockets are in align-
ment as shown in Figure 22-19.
 
3. With your eyes open or closed, stay for six to eight breaths.
 
Figure 22-19: 
Seated 
chair 
posture.
 
 
If your feet don’t touch the floor, place a folded blanket, rolled-up mat, or 
other prop underneath them. Flip to Chapter 19 for more on using Yoga props.
Seated alternate arm raise sequence
Many of the muscles that go to your neck start between your shoulders, so 
this sequence is a good way to bring circulation to that area. Be sure to use 
both parts of the sequence, the arm raise and then the arm raise and head 
turn, to get the proper results.
 
1. Start in the seated chair posture.
 
2. As you inhale, raise your slightly bent right arm as Figure 22-20a 
illustrates.

342
Part IV: Yoga as a Lifestyle 
 
3. As you exhale, return your right palm to your right thigh; repeat Steps 2 
and 3, alternating with your right and left arms two to three times each.
 
4. Continue raising and alternating your arms and turning your 
head away from each arm for two to three additional rounds as in 
Figure 22-20b.

Seated shoulder rolls
The neck and shoulders are one of the most frequent sites of tension for 
Westerners. Seated shoulder rolls can bring instant stress relief to stored-up 
tension.
 
1. Start in the seated chair posture.
 
2. Hang your arms at your sides and roll your shoulders up and back as 
you inhale (see Figure 22-21).
 
3. As you exhale, roll your shoulders down.
 
4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 four to six times and then reverse the direction 
of the rolls for four to six repetitions.

Wing-and-prayer sequence
Think of your upper back and neck as your wingspan; this sequence (as well 
as those in the following sections) helps you keep that wingspan in balance.
 
1. Start in the seated chair posture.
 
2. Join your palms together in the prayer position as in Figure 22-22a.
 
3. As you inhale, raise your arms comfortably above your head, keeping 
your hands in the prayer position as Figure 22-22b demonstrates.
 
4. As you exhale, bring your hands and arms back down, still maintain-
ing prayer position.
 
5. As you inhale, separate your hands and move your arms out like 
wings to the sides at about shoulder height, lifting your chest and 
looking straight ahead as illustrated in Figure 22-22c.
 
6. As you exhale, bring your hands and arms to the starting position in 
Step 2.
 
7. Repeat Steps 1 through 6 four to six times.

This sequence safely reaches very subtle muscles in your neck and shoulders.
 
1. Start in the seated chair posture.
 
2. As you inhale, raise the back of your right hand to eye level as shown 
in Figure 22-23a.
 
3. As you exhale, bring your right hand inward and place your palm and 
fingers at the top of your left shoulder, turning your eyes and head 
down and to the left as you follow your right hand as Figure 22-23b 
illustrates.
 
 If you have a problem rotating your neck outward to the right or the left, 
only turn as far as you feel comfortable.
 
4. As you inhale, return the back of your right hand to eye level and 
keep it moving and opening around to the right as far as is comfort-
able (see Figure 22-23c).
 
5. As you exhale, bring the back of the right hand in front of you again 
at eye level.
 
6. Continue exhaling as you bring the right hand back down to the 
seated chair posture.
 
7. Repeat Steps 1 through 6, alternating right and left sides three to four 
times each.

1. Start in the seated chair posture.
 
2. Inhale and then, as you exhale, move both hands up to eye level with 
your palms facing you as though you were looking at a newspaper 
(Figure 22-24a demonstrates).
 
3. As you inhale, move both hands up and follow your hands with your 
eyes and head until your hands are just above your forehead as 
shown in Figure 22-24b.
 
 Try not to turn your head too far back when you’re looking up at your 
hands. Think of rotating up from the level of your ears rather than your 
collar.
 
4. As you exhale, bring your chin down to your chest without moving 
your arms as in Figure 22-24c.
 
5. As you inhale, separate your hands and move your arms out like 
wings to the sides at about shoulder height, lifting your chest and 
looking straight ahead as illustrated in Figure 22-24d.
 
6. As you exhale, extend your bent arms forward like they’re going over a log 
and round your back like a camel as you look down (see Figure 22-24e).
 
7. As you inhale, lift your chest; rotate your elbows and palms inward as 
you raise your hands back to eye level as in Step 2 (see Figure 22-24a).
 
8. Repeat Steps 1 through 7 four to six times.

Seated sage twist
This twist rejuvenates the upper back as well as the entire spine. It also tones 
the abdomen.
 
Resist the temptation to crank this twist too hard. Move slowly and carefully. 
If you experience pain or discomfort, leave the twist out of your routine and 
check with your health professional before further use.
 
1. Start in the seated chair posture turned sideways with the back of the 
chair to your right; hold the sides of the chair back with your hands as 
Figure 22-25 illustrates.
 
2. As you inhale, extend or lift your spine and head upward.
 
3. As you exhale, twist your torso and head farther to the right.
 
4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3, gradually twisting to your comfort level, and 
then stay in the twist for four to six breaths.
 
5. Repeat Steps 1 through 4 on the left side.

Seated neck and shoulder massage
This simple technique is very good for releasing land mines between your 
neck and shoulders.
 
Holding, squeezing, or compressing tight spots is called ischemic massage and 
is often used by body workers to release trigger points or sensitive and irri-
table areas of the body.
 
1. Start in the seated chair posture and bring your right arm up and 
across toward your left shoulder; place your right palm down 
between the top of your left shoulder and your neck as illustrated in 
Figure 22-27.
 
2. Slowly and gently massage the surface area between the neck and 
the left shoulder in a circular motion (starting toward the neck) six to 
eight times, noticing any tight spots.
 
3. Find the tightest spots you identified in Step 2 and grab or squeeze 
each one firmly for six to eight counts.
 
4. Finish the self-massage by repeating Step 2 six to eight times.
 
5. Repeat Steps 1 through 4 with the left hand on your right side.

Ten Tips for a Great Yoga Practice
In This Chapter
▶ Preparing yourself for proper practice
▶ Creating an engaging and supportive environment
T
o succeed at anything, you must know two things: the ground rules and 
yourself. In this chapter, we give you ten hot tips for growing your Yoga 
practice into a sturdy, fruit-laden tree. If you bear these points in mind, you 
can expect to reap the benefits of your efforts surprisingly quickly. Although 
we don’t promise overnight miracles, we’re confident that regular, correct 
Yoga practice can bring you multiple advantages — physically, mentally, and 
spiritually.
Understand Yoga
To engage in Yoga successfully, you must first understand what it is and 
how it works. Sometimes people rush into Yoga practice without knowing 
anything about it, and then they have to work through a bunch of misconcep-
tions before they can benefit from it.
 
This book gives you a basic understanding of the nature and principles of 
this age-old discipline — enough for a solid start. But make time to read other 
books on Yoga to deepen your comprehension (see the appendix for sugges-
tions on resources).
Traditional Yoga involves study, a key aspect of practice for thousands of years. 
We especially recommend that you acquaint yourself with the actual literature 
of Yoga — notably the Yoga-Sutra of Patanjali and the Bhagavad-Gita — through 
the many translations available today. The Yoga tradition is vast and highly 
diverse. Discover which approach speaks to you the most.

354
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Be Clear (and Realistic) about 
Your Goals and Needs
If you want your Yoga practice to be successful, take the time to consider 
your personal situation carefully and then set your goals based on your abili-
ties and needs. Ask yourself, “How much free time do I have or want to make 
available for Yoga? What are my expectations? Do I want to become or stay fit 
and trim? Do I want to be able to relax more and discover the art of medita-
tion? Do I want to adopt Yoga as a lifestyle or explore the spiritual dimension 
of life?” When you’re realistic, you’re less likely to experience disappointment 
or guilt when your schedule seems overwhelming.
 
If you’re dealing with health issues or physical impediments, make sure that 
you consult your physician before you launch your Yoga practice.
Commit Yourself to Growth
Even if you don’t choose to practice Yoga as a lifestyle, keep an open mind 
about Yoga’s involvement in your life. Allow it to transform not only your 
body but also your mind. Don’t put a ceiling on your own development 
or assume that you’re incapable of ever achieving a certain Yoga posture 
or learning how to meditate. Let Yoga gently work with your physical and 
mental limitations and expand your abilities and help you outgrow useless 
attitudes and negative thoughts and discover new horizons.
Stay for the Long Haul
Spoiled by their consumerist societies, most people expect quick fixes. 
Although Yoga can work miracles in a short span of time, it’s not like instant 
coffee. To derive the full benefits from Yoga, you have to apply yourself dili-
gently, which also nicely strengthens your character. The longer you practice 
Yoga, the more enjoyable and beneficial it becomes. Give Yoga at least a year 
to prove itself to you. We promise you won’t be disappointed. In fact, you 
may very well come out of that year with a lifelong commitment to growing 
with Yoga!

355
 Chapter 23: Ten Tips for a Great Yoga Practice
Develop Good Habits from the Beginning
Bad habits die hard, so cultivate good Yoga habits from the outset. If pos-
sible, take two or three lessons from a qualified Yoga teacher, either in a 
group class or privately. At least read our book — and other practical Yoga 
books — carefully before trying out the postures and breathing exercises.
 
Wrong practice can do damage! Protect yourself by proceeding slowly and 
following the instructions step by step. Err on the cautious side. If in doubt, 
always consult a teacher or knowledgeable practitioner.
Vary Your Routine to Avoid Boredom
After you enjoy the initial wash of enthusiasm, your mind may start playing 
tricks on you. (Here are some favorite expressions of doubt: “Maybe Yoga 
doesn’t work.” “It doesn’t work for me.” “I really have other more important 
things to do.” “I don’t feel like practicing today.”) If you’re easily bored, vary 
your program periodically to keep your interest alive. Slogging through Yoga or 
any exercise program serves no purpose. Cultivate what the Zen Buddhists call 
“beginner’s mind”: Approach your Yoga sessions (and, in fact, everything else) 
with the same intensity and freshness that you brought to your very first ses-
sion. If you focus on each exercise properly, your mind doesn’t have time to feel 
bored. Also, the more you involve yourself in the spirit of Yoga, the more cen-
tered you become, lessening your likelihood of needing an exercise potpourri.
 
Yoga For Dummies, 2nd Edition, gives you a well-tested formula for creating 
many efficient routines for a variety of situations. You can make your pro-
grams as diversified and challenging as you like. Check out Chapter 15.
Make Awareness and Breath Your Allies
Yoga practice is so potent because, if you practice it correctly, it combines 
physical movement with awareness and proper breathing. Awareness and 
breath are Yoga’s secret weapons. The sooner you catch on to this concept, 
the more quickly you can enjoy really satisfying results. Bringing awareness 
to your exercise routine also automatically strengthens your overall capacity 

356
Part V: The Part of Tens 
for concentration and mindfulness (which we cover in Chapter 21). You’re 
able to work more efficiently and better appreciate your leisure time. In par-
ticular, conscious breathing during the exercises greatly enhances the effects 
of your practice on your body and mind, equipping you with the vitality you 
need to meet the challenges of a busy life.
Do Your Best and Don’t 
Worry about the Rest
People often anxiously watch their progress. Progress isn’t linear; sometimes 
you seem to take a step back, only to take a big leap forward in due course. 
Be diligent but relaxed about your Yoga practice. Perfectionism serves no 
purpose other than to frustrate you and irritate others. In aspiring to reach 
your goal, be kind to yourself (and others). Don’t worry about what may or 
may not happen down the line. Focus on practicing now and leave the rest to 
the power of Yoga, providence, and your good karma (see Chapter 1).
Allow Your Body to Speak Up
Your body is your best friend and counselor, and listening to it is an art well 
worth cultivating. If something doesn’t feel right, it probably isn’t. Trust your 
bodily instincts and intuitions not only in your Yoga practice but also in daily 
life. All too frequently, your body tells you one thing and your mind another. 
Learn to go with your body.
 
When practicing Hatha Yoga, be especially careful about letting your desire to 
achieve quick results get in the way of common sense and bodily wisdom. For 
instance, if a forward or backward bend feels risky, don’t test your luck. Or if 
your body tells you that you aren’t ready for the headstand (which we don’t 
recommend for beginners anyway), don’t fall victim to your own ambition.
Share Yoga
In the beginning, plan to practice Yoga with others until you find your own 
momentum. Sometimes everyone needs a little encouragement, and a sup-
portive environment is a great bonus. If you don’t go to a regular Yoga class, 
take the initiative to enlist an interested family member or friend in your 
Yoga practice. Make sure, however, that you keep any missionary zeal under 
wraps. Yoga is a wonderful gift to give to anyone, and so offer it in an attrac-
tive way: with love and tempered enthusiasm.

Ten Good Reasons 
to Practice Yoga
In This Chapter
▶ Focusing on physical health
▶ Minding your mental fitness
▶ Seeking emotional balance, awareness, and insight
Your journey of discovery in the world of Yoga is not only exciting but 
also immensely rewarding. In this chapter, we give you ten excellent 
reasons to begin that journey now and persist in it.
The effects of regular Yoga practice are pervasive and astonishing, and you 
can see good results very quickly. If you practice Hatha Yoga (the form of 
Yoga that deals specifically with the body), you may first notice an improve-
ment in your flexibility, muscle tone, and overall fitness. Certainly, expect 
to feel better. Other wonderful benefits manifest as you continue to practice 
regularly and go deeper into Yoga. You have every reason to proceed with 
confidence!
Yoga Helps You Maintain, Recover, 
or Improve Your Health
Yoga is an amazing stress-buster. When you consider that 75 to 90 percent 
of all visits to the doctor are related to stress, Yoga’s holistic approach is a 
prudent first choice for fostering well-being. Through its relaxation, postural, 
breathing, and meditation exercises as well as dietary rules, Yoga can effec-
tively lower your level of tension and anxiety. Thus, yogic practice boosts your 
immune system, which helps keep illness at bay and facilitates the physical 
healing process if you’re already sick. Research demonstrates that Yoga is a 
very effective way of dealing with a variety of health problems from hyperten-
sion, adult-onset diabetes, and respiratory illnesses (such as asthma) to sleep 

358
Part V: The Part of Tens 
disturbance, chronic headache, and lower back pain. Yoga can help improve 
your cardiovascular functions, digestion, and eyesight and even enable you to 
control pain. You can practice Yoga as both remedial and preventive medicine. 
You can’t find a cheaper health and life insurance policy! Moreover, Yoga is 
pain-free. In fact, Yoga helps overcome all forms of suffering (see Chapter 20).
Yoga Makes You Fit and Energetic
Yoga relaxes your body and mind, thereby enabling you to mobilize all the 
energy you need in order to deal efficiently with the many challenges at home 
and at work. Yoga can greatly promote your body’s flexibility, fitness, strength, 
and stamina. In addition, Yoga may even help you shed surplus pounds.
Yoga Balances Your Mind
Yoga not only assists you in maintaining or recovering your physical well-
being (see the earlier section “Yoga Helps You Maintain, Recover, or Improve 
Your Health”) but also has a profound influence on your mind. The mind 
is the source of many of your troubles — sooner or later, the body reflects 
wrong attitudes, negative thoughts, and emotional imbalance that your mind 
holds. Yoga is a powerful tool for clearing your mind and freeing you from 
mood swings. Yogic practice supports greater results than any tranquilizer 
and without the undesirable side effects of drugs. It balances you without 
dulling your mind. Through Yoga, you can stay alert but relaxed.
Yoga Is a Powerful Aid 
for Personal Growth
Yoga can help you discover the body’s hidden potential. Your body is a mar-
velous instrument, but you need to play it properly to produce beautiful, har-
monious melodies. Yoga also can guide you safely into the exploration of the 
hidden aspects of the mind, especially higher states of consciousness (such 
as ecstasy and enlightenment, which we explain in Chapter 21). It progres-
sively peels away misconceptions about yourself and about life in general 
and reveals your true nature, which is uncomplicated and blissful.

359
 Chapter 24: Ten Good Reasons to Practice Yoga
Yoga Is Truly Comprehensive 
and Empowering
Yoga offers you a sensible, growth-oriented lifestyle that covers all aspects of 
life from cradle to grave. Its repertoire includes techniques for optimal physi-
cal and mental health, for dealing creatively with the challenges of modern 
life, for transforming your sexual life, and even for making creative use of 
your dream life through the art of lucid dreaming (discussed in Chapter 20). 
Yoga makes you feel comfortable with your body, improves your self-image 
and self-esteem, and enhances your power of concentration and memory. 
Ultimately, Yoga empowers you to discover your spiritual essence and to live 
free from fear and other limiting emotions and thoughts.
Yoga Helps You Harmonize 
Your Social Relationships
By giving you a new outlook on life, Yoga can help you improve your relation-
ships with family, friends, co-workers, and others. It gives you the means to 
develop patience, tolerance, compassion, and forgiveness. Through the tech-
niques of Yoga, you can gain control of your mind and liberate yourself from 
obsessions and undesirable habits, which can stand in the way of satisfying 
relationships. Yoga also shows you how to live at peace with the world and 
attuned to your essential nature, the spirit or Self. It provides you with all 
you need to harmonize and beautify your life.
Yoga Enhances Your Awareness
Yoga enables you to greatly intensify your awareness, as we discuss in 
Chapter 1. Thus, yogic practice empowers you to approach all life situations, 
even crises, with clarity and serenity. In addition, Yoga makes you more sen-
sitive to your bodily rhythms, heightens your five senses, and even develops 
your intuitive faculty (the so-called sixth sense). Most significantly, Yoga puts 
you in touch with the spiritual reality that is the source of your everyday 
mind and awareness.

360
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Yoga Combines Well with 
Other Disciplines
Although Yoga is complete in itself, you can easily combine it with any kind 
of sports or physical workout, including aerobics and weightlifting. You also 
can practice Yoga in conjunction with any existing mental discipline, includ-
ing mnemonics (memorization) and chess. Not only is Yoga compatible in all 
cases, but it’s also bound to improve your performance.
Yoga Is Easy and Convenient
Yoga doesn’t require you to work up a sweat (unless you’re practicing some 
modern aerobic-type Yoga). You can always look pretty cool! You can prac-
tice Yoga in the comfort of your own home — or, in fact, anywhere. Although 
you don’t need to spend time traveling from place to place, beginners in par-
ticular should consider joining a Yoga class — even your trip there and back 
offers opportunities for a Yoga experience. Yoga creates rather than con-
sumes time — a major benefit in the busy and stressed lives of Westerners!
Yoga Is Liberating
Yoga can put you more in touch with your true nature, giving you a sense of 
fulfillment, inner worth, and confidence. By assisting you in reducing egotism 
and negative thoughts and emotions, Yoga has the power to bring you closer 
to lasting happiness. It builds your willpower and puts you in charge of your 
own life.
