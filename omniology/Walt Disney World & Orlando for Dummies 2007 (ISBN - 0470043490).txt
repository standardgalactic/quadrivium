About the Author
Laura Miller is a freelance writer based in Buffalo, New York,
though she’s spent countless hours scouring Central Florida’s
theme parks over the years — both with and without her five kids.
A family-travel expert who religiously makes an annual pilgrimage
to the Land the Mouse Built, she’s the author of Frommer’s Walt
Disney World and Orlando 2006 and contributes to Frommer’s
Florida and Frommer’s Walt Disney World & Orlando with Kids. She’s
currently researching and writing a guide to Florida for families.
Author’s Acknowledgments
Thanks to Amy Voss at the Orlando/Orange County Convention &
Visitors Bureau; Gary Buchanan at Walt Disney World; Taryn at
Universal Orlando; and Jacquelyn Wilson at SeaWorld. Thanks also
to all those who took the time out of their schedules to help me with
this endeavor. A special thanks goes out to my family, most espe-
cially my five children — Ryan, Austin, Nicolas, Hailey, and Davis —
for all of their assistance in helping to research and write this book.
Thanks as well to my agent, Julie Hill, whose constant encourage-
ment, support, and enthusiasm keeps me going.
And, of course, a special thanks to my editor, Naomi Kraus, whose
continued support and encouragement as well as her extensive
knowledge of all things Disney have made this book more than just
a Mickey Mouse affair.

Introduction
W
elcome to Walt Disney World and Orlando, Florida, a land ruled
by a mouse who thinks nothing of sporting bright red shorts,
gigantic white gloves, and big yellow shoes — a place that’s for some,
including the young and young-at-heart, absolutely magical. Walt Disney
World has continued to evolve, bringing back its faithful followers, and
enticing future fans. Though showing the wear and tear of a weakened
economy, Walt Disney World has remained resilient; it continues to add
attractions throughout its parks and regularly announces plans for
future projects. Millions of people make the pilgrimage each year — a
group that includes Olympic medal winners, a prince or two, and of
course us regular folks. To some, WDW is a national shrine; to others, a
right of passage, albeit a crowded one.
For some folks, charting a successful course through the home of
Mickey Mouse can seem like a lot of work. For you, it won’t be. All you
need to ensure an enjoyable trip to Orlando is patience, planning, and a
little childlike wonder — now how hard is that?
About This Book
Pay full price? Read the fine print? Do it their way?
Excuse me. There’s no need for any of that.
You picked this book because you know the For Dummies label, and you
want to go to Walt Disney World. You also probably know how much you
want to spend, the pace you want to keep, and the amount of planning
you can handle. You may not want to tend to every little detail, yet you
don’t trust just anyone to make your plans for you.
In this book, I boil down what has become a world unto itself — Walt
Disney World — and the surrounding Orlando area. Walt Disney’s Florida
legacy is still growing a full four decades after his death in 1966. At cur-
rent count, WDW includes four theme parks and a dozen lesser attrac-
tions, two entertainment districts, tens of thousands of hotel rooms,
scores of restaurants, and twin cruise ships.
Universal Orlando and SeaWorld add another four theme parks, three
resorts, and an entertainment district to the mix. Nearby are 80 or so
additional smaller attractions, as well as an avalanche of restaurants and
more than 114,000 lodging rooms in Orlando.

How can anyone sort through all these choices, you ask? It takes 
experience.
After decades of stomping through the House of the Mouse, I know
where to find the best deals (deals that are not rip-offs). In this book, I
guide you through Walt Disney World and Orlando in a clear, easy-to-
understand way, so you can find the best hotels, restaurants, and attrac-
tions without having to read this book like a novel — cover to cover.
Although you can read this book in that order if you choose, you can
also flip to only those sections that interest you. I also promise not to
overwhelm you with choices. I simply deliver the best, most essential
ingredients for a great vacation.
Please be advised that travel information is subject to change at any
time — and this disclaimer is especially true of prices (the theme parks
like to raise theirs on a whim). I, therefore, suggest that you call ahead
for confirmation or check the Internet when making your travel plans.
Doing so is especially important when you have your heart set on visit-
ing a particular attraction, because theme parks are constantly making
changes to their lineups, including shortening hours, closing shows on
certain days, and boarding up restaurants in poor economic times.
The author, editors, and publisher cannot be held responsible for the
experiences of readers while traveling. Your safety is important to us,
however, so we encourage you to stay alert and be aware of your sur-
roundings. Keep a close eye on cameras, purses, and wallets, all favorite
targets of thieves and pickpockets.
Conventions Used in This Book
To make this book an easier reference guide for you, I use some handy
abbreviations when I review hotels, restaurants, and attractions.
Walt Disney World & Orlando For Dummies 2007 
2
Dummies Post-it® Flags
As you’re reading this book, you’ll find information that you’ll want to reference as you
plan or enjoy your trip — whether it be a new hotel, a must-see attraction, or a must-
try walking tour. Mark these pages with the handy Post-it® Flags included in this book
to help make your trip planning easier!

You’ll probably notice first that I often substitute WDW or Disney World
for Walt Disney World to spare you from having to read those three
words again and again. Another common abbreviation that you’ll find is
the use of Universal in place of Universal Orlando. Also, because almost
everything in Orlando revolves around its theme parks, I often refer to
the section of Central Florida that encompasses the theme parks as
simply the parks.
And because Orlando does its best to make you max them out, I use the
following abbreviations for commonly accepted credit cards:
AE: American Express
DC: Diners Club
DISC: Discover
MC: MasterCard
V: Visa
I also include general pricing information to help you decide where to
unpack your bags or dine on the local cuisine. I use a system of dollar
signs to show a range of costs for one night in a double-occupancy room
or a meal at a restaurant.
Foolish Assumptions
As I wrote this book, I made some assumptions about you and what your
needs might be as a traveler. Here’s what I assumed about you:
 You may be an experienced traveler who hasn’t had much time to
explore Orlando and wants expert advice on how to maximize your
time and enjoy a hassle-free trip.
 You may be an inexperienced traveler looking for guidance when
determining whether to take a trip to Walt Disney World and
Orlando and how to plan for it.
 You’re not looking for a book that provides all the information avail-
able about Orlando or that lists every hotel, restaurant, or attrac-
tion available to you. Instead, you’re looking for a book that focuses
on the places that will give you the best experience in Orlando.
If you fit any of these criteria, then Walt Disney World & Orlando 
For Dummies 2007 gives you the information you’re looking for!
Introduction 3

How This Book Is Organized
Walt Disney World & Orlando For Dummies 2007 is divided into seven
parts. The chapters in each part lay out the specifics on each section’s
topic. Likewise, each chapter is written so that you don’t have to read
what came before or after, although I sometimes refer you to other areas
of the book for more information.
Here’s a brief look at the parts.
Part I: Introducing Walt Disney World and Orlando
Think of this part as the hors d’oeuvres. In this part, I tempt you with
the best experiences, hotels, eateries, and attractions at Disney and the
rest of Orlando. I give you a little history lesson (but not to worry — no
quiz will follow), suggest a few movies and books to get you in the
Mickey mood, and then tip you to Orlando’s best special events.
Because the city has some pretty distinct seasons, I also delve into the
pros and cons of visiting during different times of the year and even
throw in a weather forecast.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Walt Disney World 
and Orlando
This part covers the nitty-gritty of trip planning. Orlando has been
known to take a chunk of change out of unsuspecting visitors’ wallets, so
I suggest some ways to save money so you don’t feel like you have to
take out a second mortgage to do this trip. I delve into the various ways
to get here and give you the lowdown on vacation package options;
they’re a very popular method of traveling to Orlando — and there are a
whole lot of them out there. And because I’d like everyone to have fun
on their vacation, I also provide tips for those who could use some more
specialized trip information: families, seniors, travelers with disabilities,
and gay and lesbian travelers.
Part III: Settling into Orlando
After I get you to Orlando, I introduce you to the neighborhoods and
explore some of the modus transporto (local buses, trolleys, taxis, shut-
tles, and other vehicles to get from hither to yonder). I also give you the
lowdown on Disney’s special transportation system. From there, it’s on
to a discussion of the city’s plethora of accommodations options and in-
depth reviews of the best places to sleep. And because it takes lots of
fuel to keep you going inside the theme parks, I discuss the city’s best
places to eat and tell you all about that most Orlando of dining experi-
ences: the character meal. (Because what says Disney more than having
dinner with Donald Duck and Goofy? Or Cinderella? Or Simba? Well, you
get the idea.)

Part IV: Exploring Walt Disney World
You’re now checked in and fueled up. Great. Welcome to Walt Disney
World, the number-one tourist destination in the country. You could
easily spend months exploring this mammoth resort, but if you’re like
most visitors to the House of the Mouse, you have only a week or less to
get it all in. No worries. In this part, I explain Disney’s ticket system and
tell you about the best options in each of Disney’s major parks. And if
you don’t think a visit to WDW would be complete without a set of
Mickey ears or some other souvenir, I also fill you in on Disney’s best
shopping opportunities.
Part V: Exploring the Rest of Orlando
Can’t face all Mickey, all the time? No problem. There is, in fact, a lot
more to Orlando than Disney World. If theme parks are your thing,
Universal Orlando, SeaWorld, and Discovery Cove all await you, and I fill
you in on all their highlights. The city is also home to a plethora of
smaller attractions and rides, and I provide in-depth information on the
best of them. If you prefer exercising your credit card to walking the
parks, I let you know the best places for shopaholics to indulge. And if
you need a break from the city itself, I give you two great day-trip
options. One thing is for certain: You won’t get bored.
Part VI: Living It Up After Dark: Orlando Nightlife
Kids may rule this town, but Disney and the rest of Orlando have discov-
ered that many people want to party into the night. In Part VI, I explore
Pleasure Island, CityWalk, and other thriving Orlando hot spots. Then I
give you details on Orlando’s popular dinner shows and the city’s per-
forming arts. (Yes, Orlando does indeed have a respected cultural
scene.)
Part VII: The Part of Tens
Every For Dummies book offers the Part of Tens. Finding this part in a
For Dummies book is as certain as annual price hikes at Disney and
Universal. In Part VII, I give you parting knowledge about cheap attrac-
tions and places to stay fit as a fiddle.
I’ve also included an appendix — your Quick Concierge — containing
plenty of handy information you may need when traveling in Orlando,
such as phone numbers and addresses of emergency personnel or area
hospitals and pharmacies, contact information for baby sitters, and lists
of local newspapers and magazines. Check out this appendix when
searching for answers to the many little questions that may come up as
you travel.
Introduction 5

If you want even more detailed or specialized information, I also include
a list of the best sources of Orlando and Disney information, from official
tourist offices to Web sites to newspapers and magazines.
You can easily find the Quick Concierge because it’s printed on yellow
paper.
Icons Used in This Book
You find six icons throughout this guide:
Keep an eye out for the Bargain Alert icon as you seek out money-saving
tips or great deals.
Best of the Best highlights the best that Orlando has to offer in all 
categories — hotels, restaurants, attractions, activities, shopping, and
nightlife.
Watch for the Heads Up icon to identify annoying or potentially danger-
ous situations such as tourist traps, unsafe neighborhoods, budgetary
rip-offs, and other things to beware.
Find out useful advice on things to do and ways to schedule your time
when you see the Tip icon.
You encounter these icons when I start barnstorming through the big
parks. Because you may very well be toting kids when you visit Orlando,
I decided to get some kids’ input (namely, my five children, ages 4 to 12)
on many of the popular rides and attractions in the city.
Where to Go from Here
I’ve briefed you on what to expect from this book and told you how to
use it to plan a magical vacation to Walt Disney World — no pixie dust
necessary. So start reading; you have a lot to do before you arrive, from
arranging a place where you’ll rest your weary feet each night to explor-
ing the best that Orlando’s theme parks have to offer. Like the Boy
Scouts’ creed, the successful Orlando traveler needs to “be prepared”;
follow the advice in this book, and you will be. So put on your Mouse
ears and smile — you’re going to Disney World!

acationing in Orlando is like escaping to another time and place, a

and the young at heart from all over the world, all of whom come to
experience the theme parks, the world-class resorts, and the area’s spec-
tacular natural beauty. It should come as no surprise to you that
Orlando is the number-one family vacation destination in the United
States, not to mention one of the top vacation destinations in the world.
Yes, it gets crowded, and in the summer it’s hot and sticky, but one thing
you definitely won’t ever be is bored.
Note: With the exception of the items listed in “The Best Orlando
Experiences,” I highlight all the hotels, restaurants, and attractions in
this chapter with a Best of the Best icon throughout the rest of this

The Best Orlando Experiences
If images of Cinderella Castle, its spires reaching high up to the sky, pop
into your head the minute anyone mentions Orlando, you’re not alone.
The Magic Kingdom’s iconic castle and the lovable mouse who started it
all are, by far, the most famous of all Disney icons and the reason most
folks venture to the Sunshine State in the first place. But keep in mind
that although a visit to the Magic Kingdom is definitely one of the
biggest highlights of an Orlando vacation, especially if you have kids,
plenty more attractions and experiences await:
 Spend a day exploring Disney’s Animal Kingdom. Trek through
the Himalayan Mountains in search of the legendary Yeti on
Expedition Everest, or make your way by foot through the rain
forests and jungles of Asia for a glimpse of the exotic wildlife that
inhabit the park. Kali River Rapids will leave you soaked, but that’s
half the fun. Head out on the Kilimanjaro Safaris for an expedition
through the African savanna or travel back to the time when
dinosaurs ruled the earth. Be sure to catch Mickey’s Jammin’
Jungle Parade, one of the most distinctive and lively parades in all
of Disney. Check out Chapter 15 for details on other attractions in
the park.
 Spend a day traveling the world at Epcot. At Epcot, you can find
the high-speed thrills of Mission: SPACE and Test Track, the
breathtaking experience of Soarin’ over the California landscape,
and the simple pleasure of splashing about in the dancing waters.
Then it’s off to tour some of the world’s most fascinating countries
along the World Showcase. Play on the Viking ship in Norway,
dance with the oompah band in Germany, or try to belly dance
with the natives in Morocco. For more on things to do at Epcot, see
Chapter 13.
 Go Behind the Scenes at Disney–MGM Studios. You can find some
of the most intense thrills in all of Walt Disney World here, with
both the Twilight Zone Tower of Terror and Rock ’n’ Roller
Coaster Starring Aerosmith taking center stage. But be sure to take
in some of the spectacular shows, too — this is a studio after all.
Top billing goes to Lights, Motors, Action! Extreme Stunt Show,
the park’s newest addition, and the Indiana Jones Epic Stunt
Spectacular! Be sure to close out the night with the incredible
Fantasmic!, an after-dark show that combines a love for all things
Disney with the most amazing combination of water and fireworks.
See Chapter 14 for the lowdown on all the park has to offer.
 Experience Universal Studios Florida (USF). Once just a diversion,
Universal has worked hard to turn itself into a true destination. The
rides here run the gamut from all ages to “What was I thinking?”
Not-to-be-missed attractions include Revenge of the Mummy,
Terminator 2: 3D Battle Across Time, Men in Black Alien Attack,
Part I: Introducing Walt Disney World and Orlando 
12

and recent additions: Fear Factor Live and Shrek 4-D. Top off the
day by taking in the all new nighttime spectacular Universal 360.
The entire lagoon lights up with pyrotechnic effects, laser lights,
and four 360-degree projection cinespheres. Chapter 18 offers infor-
mation on other cool things to see and do at USF.
 Test your physical limits at Islands of Adventure. You can spin;
you can fly upside down; you can get wet. And that’s all just in the
first few minutes in this park. Don’t miss the Amazing Adventures
of Spider-Man; Dueling Dragons twin roller coasters; Jurassic Park
River Adventure; and the big, green behemoth, the Incredible Hulk
Coaster. If it’s really hot out, a good soak on Popeye & Bluto’s Bilge-
Rat Barges is just the thing to refresh you. For information on other
adventures awaiting you in the park, see Chapter 19.
 Find your own waterworld at SeaWorld and Discovery Cove.
There are a few thrill rides at SeaWorld, namely Journey to
Atlantis, Kraken, and Wild Arctic, but the real reason to come to
both of these parks is the chance to observe and interact with the
wide variety of marine life that inhabits them. Discovery Cove even
allows you the chance to swim with a dolphin. It’s a bit pricey, but
it’s well worth it if you appreciate unique experiences. For more
information on both parks, see Chapter 20.
 Take in an evening park performance. Many of the parks love to
close out their day with a fireworks display or show-stopping per-
formance that’s guaranteed to impress. So check out the Magic
Kingdom’s Wishes Nighttime Spectacular or “SpectroMagic”
Parade, Epcot’s IllumiNations: Reflections of Earth,
Disney–MGM’s Fantasmic!, Universal Studios’ Universal 360, or
SeaWorld’s Odyssea, Fusion, or Mistify. For a truly magical per-
formance, see Cirque du Soleil’s La Nouba; it’s expensive, but also
unforgettable. For information on all of these spectacles, see
Chapters 12, 13, 14, 18, 20, and 25.
 Go to Gatorland. An Orlando original, Gatorland has been astound-
ing visitors with its crocodiles and alligators since long before the
Mouse moved in. Take in one of the amazing shows, such as Gator
Wrestlin’ and Gator Jumparoo, or just take a leisurely stroll
through swamp and marsh on the boardwalks — no one’s in a
hurry here. For more information on Gatorland, see Chapter 21.
The Best Hotels
One of the cool things about a trip to Orlando is the chance to stay 
at one of its great resorts or themed hotels. Check out Chapter 9 for
more in-depth information about all the accommodations listed in this
section:
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Walt Disney World and Orlando 13

 Best for Families: Both Disney’s Animal Kingdom Lodge and
Disney’s Wilderness Lodge offer spectacular surroundings, kid-
friendly eateries, and rooms with bunk beds. Nearby Lake Buena
Vista is where you can find the Nickelodeon Family Suites by
Holiday Inn, which features themed KidSuites (separate sleeping
areas with bunk beds, game stations, and TVs for the kids), water-
park-like pools, and Nick-style entertainment. In Kissimmee, the
Holiday Inn Nikki Bird and the Seralago Hotel & Suites Main Gate
East both feature tons of on-site activities and kid suites, too.
 Best Inexpensive Hotels: If your budget determines where you
stay, you have several good choices that offer basic amenities in
convenient locations for a low price. On Disney property, choose
Disney’s Pop Century Resort, which offers themed motel-style
rooms for the lowest prices in Mickeyville. Disney’s All-Star
Resorts recently revamped several of their rooms making them into
suites — and they’re some of the least expensive in town. The
Masters Inn Maingate offers a good location and moderate ameni-
ties for less than $50 a night, as does the Microtel Inn & Suites.
 Best Moderate Hotels: Disney’s Coronado Springs Resort edges
out the other two WDW moderate resorts with slightly larger rooms
and a cool Mayan temple pool.
 Best for a Romantic Getaway: The Portofino Bay Hotel at
Universal is molto romantic with its quaint Italian-village theme. If
money is no object, sweep your significant other off to a getaway at
the lushly tropical Ritz-Carlton Orlando, Grande Lakes or the
Mediterranean-inspired Villas of Grand Cypress.
 Best Hotel for Business Travelers: The Orlando World Center
Marriott in Lake Buena Vista and the Peabody Orlando both offer
an extensive array of business services and amenities.
 Best Location: All three Universal Orlando resorts are within walk-
ing distance of Universal’s parks and CityWalk, and all offer boat
transportation to the theme parks as well. But if I had to choose the
best of the bunch for location and value, I like the Royal Pacific
Resort best. At WDW, Disney’s Grand Floridian Resort & Spa
offers the best accommodations in the World and is right on the
monorail. For those who must be in the thick of it all, Disney’s
Yacht Club Resort and Disney’s Beach Club Resort (both close to
Epcot) also get my vote.
 Best Pools: The Hard Rock Hotel boasts a sandy beach and an
underwater sound system that brings out the lounging rock star in
you. Stormalong Bay is the name given to the 3-acre mini water
park that calls itself a pool at Disney’s Yacht Club Resort and
Disney’s Beach Club Resort. Away from the theme parks, the Hyatt
Regency Grand Cypress has an amazing lagoon-like pool that
Part I: Introducing Walt Disney World and Orlando 
14

sports rock grottoes and 12 waterfalls, while the JW Marriott
Orlando, Grande Lakes boasts an incredible lazy river surrounded
by lush landscaping. The Nickelodeon Family Suites by Holiday
Inn wins the kids vote with its water-park-style pools sporting
flumes, climbing nets, and slides.
The Best Restaurants
Fast food may rule in Orlando, but the city doesn’t lack good places to
dine. You can find more in-depth information about all of these restau-
rants in Chapter 10:
 Best for Kids: It’s hard to go wrong with any of the Walt Disney
World character breakfasts. Among Disney’s resorts the
Whispering Canyon Café (Wilderness Lodge) ensures a stompin’
good time with its kid-friendly activities and wild Western theme.
Kids also love the noisy jungle-themed Rainforest Café (Downtown
Disney and Animal Kingdom).
 Best Seafood: Todd English’s bluezoo (inside the Dolphin) is a rela-
tive newcomer on the scene, but consistently draws raves for its
food and décor. Fulton’s Crab House (Pleasure Island) is a long-
standing favorite with a great wine list and a creative menu.
 Best Steakhouse: The highly regarded Yachtsman Steakhouse
(Disney’s Yacht Club Resort) offers wood-fire grilled steaks. Outside
the parks try Charley’s Steak House (I-Drive), where the steaks are
grilled over a fiery pit for a truly flavorful meal.
 Best Dining with a View: This one’s a toss-up between Manuel’s on
the 28th, which offers a stunning after-dark view of the city and
food to match, and the California Grill, which boasts spectacular
views of Disney’s fireworks and a winning wine list.
 Best Buffet: Boma–Flavors of Africa, inside Disney’s Animal
Kingdom Lodge, offers the most eclectic buffet menu in Orlando,
mingling traditional buffet items with exotic African fare. The wine
list features an array of African vintages.
 Best Margarita: Head to Jimmy Buffet’s Margaritaville, of course.
The mango margarita’s the best of the bunch.
 Best Spot for a Romantic Meal: Victoria & Albert’s, in Disney’s
Grand Floridian Resort & Spa, is the runaway leader in this 
category.
 Best Value: Kim Wu has been a local favorite for over 20 years and
features fabulous food and friendly service. Café Tu Tu Tango
offers inexpensive tapas dishes, ranging from Cajun egg rolls with
blackened chicken to alligator bites that are perfect for sharing.
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Walt Disney World and Orlando 15

The Best Thrill Rides
If you’re a speed freak who lives for the ups and downs of a good ride,
here are the top stomach churners and G-force generators in Orlando:
 Expedition Everest (Animal Kingdom): Disney’s latest contribution
to the thrills category takes you on a hair-raising expedition
through the Himalayan Mountains ending in a face-to-face
encounter with the legendary Yeti. See Chapter 15.
 Mission: SPACE (Epcot): Disney used NASA technology to create an
astronaut simulator so effective that they’ve had to install “lunch
bags” for all the motion sickness it causes. See Chapter 13.
 Rock ’n’ Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith (Disney–MGM
Studios): You launch from 0 to 60 mph in 2.8 seconds and go right
into the first inversion as 120 speakers in your “stretch limo” main-
line Aerosmith at (yeeeow!) 32,000 watts right into your ears. See
Chapter 14.
 Twilight Zone Tower of Terror (Disney–MGM Studios): The free-
fall experiences (there are several possible scenarios) are more
than thrilling — they’re scary. After your legs stop shaking, you
may want to ride again. See Chapter 14.
 Summit Plummet (Disney’s Blizzard Beach): This one starts slow,
with a lift ride to a 120-foot mountain summit. But it finishes with
the world’s fastest body slide, a test of your courage and swimsuit
as it virtually goes straight down and has you moving sans vehicle
at 60 mph by the end. See Chapter 16.
 Revenge of the Mummy (Universal Studios Florida): Universal’s
newest thrill ride, though now a few years old, combines a coaster
run with magnetism and the best cinematic special-effects technol-
ogy (flame ceilings, scarabs pouring out of the walls) for a ride that
touches on your worst phobias. See Chapter 18.
 The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man (Islands of Adventure): 3-
D doesn’t get any better than this chase-the-bad-guys ride where
you twist, spin, and soar before a simulated 400-foot drop that feels
an awful lot like the real thing. It’s sure to get your Spidey senses
tingling. See Chapter 19.
 Dueling Dragons (Islands of Adventure): Your legs dangle as you
do five inversions at 55 to 60 mph and — get this! — three times
come within 12 inches of the other roller coaster. See Chapter 19.
 The Incredible Hulk Coaster (Islands of Adventure): You blast
from 0 to 40 mph in two seconds, spin upside down more than 100
feet from the ground, and execute seven rollovers and two deep
drops on this glow-in-the-dark roller coaster. You may find this hard
to believe, but it’s the smoothest ride around. See Chapter 19.
Part I: Introducing Walt Disney World and Orlando 
16

 Jurassic Park River Adventure (Islands of Adventure): Riders
travel through a prehistoric land inhabited by fierce, unbelievably
real-looking dinosaurs. Creatures five stories tall growl and bare
their teeth, some within inches of your face. As if that weren’t
enough, after being threatened by a Tyrannosaurus rex, you plunge
85 feet almost straight down into the water below. See Chapter 19.
 Kraken (SeaWorld): This floorless, open-sided coaster uses speed
(up to 65 mph), steep climbs, deep drops, and seven loops to
create a stomach-churning ride that lasts far too long for some
folks. See Chapter 20.
The Best of the Rest
For those who can’t stomach the thought of boarding anything that pulls
the same G-forces as a fighter jet or induces adrenaline rushes of any
sort of magnitude, the theme parks have several exceptional (and
tamer) rides and shows that nobody should overlook:
 The Haunted Mansion (Magic Kingdom): Forget the unfortunate
Eddie Murphy film and be sure to visit this cult favorite, which
shows off Disney’s knack for details as 999 ghosts offer up more
delights than frights. See Chapter 12.
 Pirates of the Caribbean (Magic Kingdom): This one’s another
oldie but goodie, made even more popular by the Oscar-nominated
film of the same name. You’ve got randy, rum-filled pirates, and lots
of yo-ho-ho music. Recent refurbishments spiced it up even further
to include improved special effects and famous faces including
Captain Jack Sparrow, Barbossa, and Davy Jones. See Chapter 12.
 Test Track (Epcot): Fasten your seatbelts. This collaboration with
GM allows riders to take a “car” through a series of standard motor
vehicle test sequences that include a near crash, a speed run, and
some rather interesting weather. It’s not adrenaline pumping
enough to be considered a thriller, but it’s definitely a cool ride. See
Chapter 13.
 Soarin’ (Epcot): Soarin’ is the latest ride to debut at Epcot. After
boarding the multiseat gliders, you’ll find yourself flying high over
some of California’s most spectacular landscapes with realistic mul-
tisensory effects. See Chapter 13.
 Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular! (Disney–MGM Studios):
Special effects, razzle-dazzle stunts, and pyrotechnics make this
stunt show worth the (incredibly long) wait. Wear a brightly col-
ored shirt, wave your arms spastically, and you may be called up
on stage as an extra. See Chapter 14.
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Walt Disney World and Orlando 17

 Lights, Motors, Action! Extreme Stunt Show (Disney–MGM
Studios): The thrill of a high-speed car chase, pyrotechnics, special
effects, and some amazing stunt driving add up to an action-packed
show for the whole family. See Chapter 14.
 Muppet Vision 3-D (Disney–MGM Studios): The action takes place
in a perfect recreation of the Muppets’ theater (complete with the
blessedly crotchety Statler and Waldorf critiquing the action from
the balcony) and is a zany mix of 3-D film, animatronics, live action,
and special effects. See Chapter 14.
 Festival of the Lion King (Animal Kingdom): One of the best shows
in town, this is a don’t-miss Broadway-esque version of the famous
Circle of Life. See Chapter 15.
 Kilimanjaro Safaris (Animal Kingdom): At this must-see attraction,
the special safari trucks bump you about as you head out into
Disney’s version of the African wilderness. You’ll enjoy the thrill of
seeing giraffes and zebras up close. See Chapter 15.
 Men in Black Alien Attack (Universal Studios Florida): Zap icky
aliens with ray guns as you ride through the streets of New York. At
the conclusion, you tackle the Big Roach himself and then get rated
by Will Smith for your shooting prowess. See Chapter 18.
 Shrek 4-D (Universal Studios Florida): This attraction uses 3-D
movie effects married with seats that move and bounce to continue
the story of Shrek and Fiona. It’s fun for all ages and very popular!
See Chapter 18.
 Terminator 2: 3D Battle Across Time (Universal Studios Florida):
This production features the creepy-steely T-1,000,000 and live-
action doubles of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Edward Furlong, who
roar onto the stage on Harleys and then into a giant movie screen, a
very cool trick you absolutely must see. This show is an absolute
winner. See Chapter 18.
 Popeye & Bluto’s Bilge-Rat Barges (Islands of Adventure): A bit
too tame to be considered a thrill ride, this white-water raft experi-
ence can have you soaked in no time at all. If the waves don’t get
you, the kids firing water soakers at you from the sidelines won’t
miss. See Chapter 19.
 Believe (SeaWorld): This all new Shamu extravaganza will have you
“oohing” and “ahhing” even more than before as the sleek, black-
and-white killer whale shows off his skill and strength on a splashy
souped-up set. See Chapter 20.
 Shark Encounter (SeaWorld): At this aquatic exhibit, you find a
walk-through tunnel populated with the scarier denizens of the
deep, such as moray eels, barracudas, rays, scorpion fish, and (of
course) sharks. It’s the coolest aquarium in town. See Chapter 20.

into Orlando
In This Chapter
 Taking in some history
 Catching up on the local cuisine
 Mastering the local lingo
 Selecting some pretrip books and films
T
his chapter offers a bit of perspective into how Orlando evolved
from a sleepy little Southern town to the theme-park capital of the
world. After our quick trip back in time, I give you an overview of
Florida’s cuisine scene and then offer a tutorial on the local lingo. If you
want even more background on Orlando and WDW, I recommend a hand-
ful of books and films for you at the end of this chapter.
History 101: The Main Events
Believe it or not, there was life in Orlando before Mickey. The city’s
transformation into theme-park mecca didn’t happen overnight. And it
may never have happened if Walt Disney hadn’t run out of real estate in
California.
Orlando B.D. (Before Disney)
Before Disney, Universal, SeaWorld, and the wealth of other tourist
attractions that exist today, Central Florida was ruled by the economics
of the three C industries: cotton, cattle, and citrus.
Originally named Jernigan, the town now known as Orlando had its gene-
sis in the remnants of an Army post that was abandoned in 1849. The
name was officially changed to Orlando in 1857, though the origin of the
moniker is somewhat opaque. (Depending on whom you ask, the city
was named for a plantation owner, the friend of a city commissioner, or a
character from Shakespeare’s As You Like It.) The cattle and cotton

industries thrived here until the Civil War, when area homesteaders real-
ized that citrus trees were far easier to grow than cotton and just about
every field was taken over by lush orange groves. At its peak, in the
1950s, more than 80,000 acres of citrus trees were thriving throughout
Central Florida. The ’50s also saw two major developments that would
bring even more people and industry to the area: the building of the
space center at nearby Cape Canaveral and (most important of all) the
invention of air-conditioning.
Around this time, Walt Disney began making waves by opening
Disneyland in Anaheim, California. The doors officially opened July 17,
1955, and it was an instant hit. Soon, the overwhelming demand made it
obvious to Walt that he needed to expand. However, his 27 acres in the
middle of the city didn’t exactly give him the room for his next endeavor.
So he turned his eyes eastward, to Florida.
Orlando A.D. (After Disney)
In a top-secret operation that would have impressed even the CIA, Walt
Disney began a search for the site of his next theme park, and, having
decided on his new location, began secretly buying up land through
dummy corporations. On November 11, 1965 (the city’s version of 
D-day) — after Disney had acquired more than 28,000 acres for a mere
$5.5 million — he came clean and announced that a new Disney theme
park would be built in Orlando, Florida. Unfortunately, Walt never got to
see his dream become a reality; he passed away the morning of
December 15, 1966, a mere year after his plans were unveiled. His
brother, Roy O. Disney, decided that the right thing to do was to carry
on in Walt’s name.
Construction began on the Magic Kingdom (see Chapter 12) and its first
two resorts in 1969. On a fine fall day, October 1, 1971, Roy O. Disney led
the dedication ceremony that officially opened the Walt Disney World
Resort to the public.
SeaWorld (see Chapter 20) splashed onto the scene soon after, when it
opened to the public on December 15, 1973. And it seemed, for a while,
that SeaWorld’s opening would be it on Orlando’s expansion front. But
Disney continued to break attendance records each year and, not con-
tent to rest on its laurels — or its acres of empty land — the Walt Disney
World Resort continued expanding. In 1982, 11 years after Magic
Kingdom opened, Epcot (see Chapter 13) was christened the second
WDW theme park. In 1989, the Disney–MGM Studios (see Chapter 14), 
a behind-the-scenes look at Tinseltown, became the third jewel in the
WDW park crown. At the same time, WDW added Typhoon Lagoon
(a 56-acre water theme park; see Chapter 16), and Pleasure Island
(a nightclub district for adults; see Chapter 25).
Part I: Introducing Walt Disney World and Orlando 
20

A year later, Universal Studios Florida (see Chapter 18) brought the
world of movies to life in Orlando, opening its doors in 1990. Direct com-
petition spurred Disney to create its fourth and, currently, last theme
park in Orlando. A cross between conservation park and theme park,
Animal Kingdom (see Chapter 15) opened its doors on Earth Day, 
April 22, 1998. Universal immediately countered with CityWalk, a vast
nighttime entertainment district (see Chapter 25). Not to be outdone,
Disney stormed back by consolidating its three major after-park-hours
entertainment, dining, and shopping venues — Disney’s West Side,
Pleasure Island, and the Disney Village Marketplace — into an all-
encompassing zone called Downtown Disney. The Disney folks also
started their own cruise line for good measure.
Universal didn’t follow out to sea, but it upped the ante when it opened
its second park in 1999. Islands of Adventure (see Chapter 19) was all
about the thrills of the theme-park experience. Islands, when combined
with CityWalk, Universal Studios Florida, and several on-property
resorts, helped Universal complete its transformation into the resort
destination of Universal Orlando, as it’s now known. No longer just a
day trip, Universal now offers the total vacation experience, just as
Disney does.
The most recent theme-park addition to the Orlando roster came unex-
pectedly from SeaWorld. It decided to keep doing what it does best and
opened Discovery Cove (see Chapter 20) in 2000. More than just a
theme park, this is an all-inclusive, interactive, marine experience, offer-
ing snorkeling and dolphin swims. Even more surprising, SeaWorld
added its first roller coaster, the unquestionably thrilling Kraken. Future
plans from SeaWorld include the addition of an eco-themed water park
scheduled to open in 2008.
Things have quieted down a bit in the expansion department, but the
theme parks are hardly sitting still, constantly revising and building new
attractions. Orlando currently offers more than 95 attractions, 114,000
hotel rooms, and 5,180 restaurants, as well as the second largest conven-
tion center in the nation. The city is showing signs of an improved econ-
omy, and the travel landscape has recently begun to see the numbers
reflected in visitor turnout as it once again is reaching sky-high levels.
Tourism, of course, has become the leading industry for Central Florida
with more than 50 million visitors annually and an economic impact of
$28.2 billion. And it all started because of a mouse named Mickey.
Taste of Orlando: Local Cuisine
Offerings have improved in recent years as the city has opened a fair
share of good restaurants, but the Orlando dining scene can’t compete
with the likes of foodie cities like San Francisco or New York. And if
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Orlando 21

there’s a predominant cuisine, it’s fast food, with the many casual eater-
ies, a few steps higher on the food chain, coming in a very close second.
The biggest decision that most theme-park-goers have to make is
whether to opt for a burger, a taco, or a hot dog along with the ubiqui-
tous french fries. And don’t worry about finding a branch of your
favorite chain, should the urge strike you; the odds are that you can find
not just one but several outlets of it within reach of your hotel.
Though the city caters to a rich and diverse clientele, don’t expect to
find an equitable number of ethnic eateries. The most famous spots in
town for ethnic cuisine are Epcot’s World Showcase restaurants.
Although theme-park food is not exactly first-class, some of it can be sur-
prisingly good. On the healthy front, you’ll find plenty of fresh fruit —
Orlando is still a major citrus town — and even the theme parks now
offer a few healthier and vegetarian options beyond the usual fast food.
The biggest news on the city’s dining front over the last five years has
been the increasing number of gourmet spots for finicky foodies.
Famous culinary magicians, such as Wolfgang Puck, Emeril Lagasse, and
Todd English, have all opened restaurants here. A few first-class steak-
houses will please carnivores. And Universal has stepped up theme-park
dining a few notches with the addition of its Islands of Adventure eater-
ies. Something you can’t find, however, is a bevy of high-class seafood
restaurants; landlocked Orlando isn’t nearly as stuck on seafood as most
other cities, especially the way those along the coastlines are. If you
must have that lobster, however, you can find a list of a few noteworthy
spots, along with all my other best picks for dining, in Chapter 10.
Given the importance that the city places on entertainment value, it
probably shouldn’t surprise you that Orlando’s most famous dining
experience — the character meal — doesn’t really revolve around the
cuisine. The name says it all: You and the kids get to chow down on
buffet food with Mickey or Goofy, SpongeBob Squarepants, or even
Shamu. The fare at these ubiquitous events, staged at most of the theme
parks in some form or another, and even at select hotels, won’t often
tickle your taste buds, but the food’s not really the point. Who cares
what pancakes taste like when Cinderella is smiling beatifically at your
enthralled 3-year-old or Mickey is posing with you for that all-important
Kodak moment? Disney has turned its character meals into something of
an art form, and Universal and SeaWorld have recently followed suit. For
a rundown of the best character meals in town, see Chapter 10.
Words to the Wise: The Local Lingo
Though good old-fashioned English is all you need to know in order to
have a blast in Orlando, the theme parks do have a language all their
own. Knowing the right word or phrase may help ease your way as you
navigate the maze of the city’s rides and attractions. Here’s a rundown of
common terms you’ll likely come across while in Orlando:
Part I: Introducing Walt Disney World and Orlando 
22

 FASTPASS: This is Disney’s legal line-jumping pass, and it’s avail-
able at most of WDW’s primo park rides. You insert your park ticket
into a machine, which spits out a pass with a time window (usually
of about an hour) stamped on it. You come back within the window
indicated, and you can get in a special line with little to no wait. For
more on FASTPASS, see Chapter 11.
 Universal Express Plus Pass: This is Universal’s answer to Disney’s
FASTPASS; however, here you’ll pay extra for the privilege of skip-
ping the lines. For more information, see Chapter 18.
 Ride-share: Most of Orlando’s theme parks operate a ride-share
program (also known as a parent-swap or child-swap) for parents
with small children at their major attractions. With this option, one
parent can ride an attraction with the kids who are able to ride,
while the other parent stays with the kids too young to partake;
then the adults can switch places without the second one having to
stand in line again. Notify one of the ride staff if you want to partici-
pate when you get in line.
 Cast member: In its ever-present attempt to keep up the illusion
that WDW is some kind of giant ongoing production, Disney refers
to its staff as cast members. Whatever you call them, they are
almost always knowledgeable and well trained.
 Advanced Dining Reservations: This is the Disney version of a
restaurant reservation (and the concept is being used increasingly
at other Orlando restaurants as well). Instead of reserving an exact
time at a restaurant, you reserve the right to arrive at a specific
time and get the next available table (which can sometimes —
though not often — take up to 30 minutes). For more on this
system, see Chapter 10.
In addition, many locals commonly shorten or abbreviate the major
theme-park names, as do a number of the highway signs you’ll see on
the road. Universal Orlando is often just referred to as Universal and
Universal Studios Florida is shortened to Universal Studios or abbrevi-
ated USF, while Islands of Adventure is either Islands or IOA. Walt Disney
World is usually known merely as Disney World, Disney, or WDW.
Background Check: Recommended 
Books and Movies
The best Walt Disney World and Orlando guidebook on the planet (yes,
this one) covers almost everything most travelers need and want to
know. But, to be fair, here are a few others that can get you into Mickey
mode before you arrive:
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Orlando 23

 The Walt Disney World Trivia Book Volume 2 (Intrepid Traveler,
2006) is loaded with fun facts and minutiae about Disney World.
Hundreds of multiple-choice questions keep you and your kids
entertained even as they enlighten.
 Hidden Mickeys, 2nd Edition: A Field Guide to Walt Disney
World’s Best Kept Secrets (Intrepid Traveler, 2005) will have you
looking here, there, and everywhere to find these famous hidden
icons. The guide is filled with pages of the best places to find them,
but you’re likely to find even more after you’ve gotten the hang of
how to look.
 Married to the Mouse: Walt Disney World and Orlando (Yale
University Press, 2003) is a serious and not always flattering look at
the relationship between the Disney corporation and the city of
Orlando. It’s a trifle didactic in tone, but its in-depth details make it
fascinating reading nonetheless.
 Since the World Began (1996; Hyperion) was published to coin-
cide with Disney World’s 25th anniversary and is a history of
WDW’s first 25 years. It offers a lot of interesting information and
insight into the creation of all Disney’s parks and resorts.
 Orlando: City of Dreams (Arcadia, 2003) is a meticulously
researched history of Orlando before it became the city of the
Mouse.
 How It Feels to Be Colored Me (1928), Mules and Men (1935),
Their Eyes Were Watching God (1937), The Florida Negro (1938),
and other books and essays by Zora Neale Hurston chronicle life
and racism in Florida, including Eatonville, the town just north of
Orlando where she grew up. If you’re a Hurston fan, don’t miss the
listing for the January festival in her honor in the Calendar of
Events in Chapter 3.
If your tastes run more toward the visual medium, there’s no shortage of
films that can get you in the mood for your Orlando vacation. Here are a
few viewing suggestions before you set out on your trip:
 Disney’s plethora of animated films will introduce kids to the char-
acters and ride themes they’ll be running into inside WDW. A few
recent goodies include Finding Nemo, The Lion King, Toy Story
(and Toy Story 2), Aladdin, Lilo & Stitch, 101 Dalmatians, The Little
Mermaid, and Beauty and the Beast. For an introduction to Disney’s
classic characters (who are alive and well in the theme parks), 
I suggest Cinderella, Alice in Wonderland, Peter Pan, Sleeping Beauty,
Dumbo, Pinocchio, and Fantasia (though this last film may be a tad
too sophisticated for very young kids).
 If you prefer live action to animation, break out the popcorn and
put on any of these pictures, all of which are represented in some
form or another inside the Disney parks: Mary Poppins; Honey, 
Part I: Introducing Walt Disney World and Orlando 
24

I Shrunk the Kids; Swiss Family Robinson; and, more recently, The
Haunted Mansion and the Oscar-nominated Pirates of the Caribbean.
 They do say it’s the place to “Ride the Movies” so it should come as
no surprise that Universal Studios Florida is filled with rides and
attractions that seemingly put you smack in the middle of some of
Universal’s most famous films. Some of the best previews include
The Mummy, Back to the Future, Twister, Jaws, Men in Black, Shrek,
E.T., and Terminator 2: Judgment Day. If you’re heading to Islands of
Adventure, then Jurassic Park, X-Men, and Spider-Man should be on
to your movie list. Pick up a copy of The Cat in the Hat (or any one
of Dr. Seuss’s classic books for that matter) for the younger kids.
Universal caters more to teens and adults than Disney does, and
these films (like the rides they inspired) are definitely aimed more
at that audience; so take your child’s age into consideration before
popping that movie in.
 Before heading off to SeaWorld, you may want to watch a few
marine-related National Geographic specials to get some back-
ground on some of the animals you can see in that park.

Chapter 3
Deciding When to Go
In This Chapter
 Considering the pros and cons of traveling in each season
 Checking out Orlando’s weather patterns
 Consulting a calendar of special occasions
A
lthough Orlando is bustling with activity throughout the year, some
seasons are definitely busier than others. When you go may very
well affect what you see, how much you pay, and how long you stand in
line. In this chapter, I explain the advantages and disadvantages of visit-
ing during the spring, summer, fall, and winter months so you can decide
the best time for your big vacation.
The Secrets of the Seasons
Although Orlando has something for all ages, the city is primarily a des-
tination for families. So any time children are out of school, whether for
spring break or a three-day holiday, the theme parks are a tangle of
pushy, sweaty, little bodies. By far the busiest times to visit are during
spring break (Feb to mid-Apr), the summer (Memorial Day weekend to
Labor Day weekend), and the winter holidays (Thanksgiving week and
mid-Dec to early Jan). Keep in mind that any holidays that fall during
those peak-season weeks bring with them exponential increases in
crowd levels and a vacation experience that may very well border on the
insane.
Obviously, your vacation experience would be the best when crowds are
thinnest and the weather is mild. In most destinations, such times would
normally describe the off season; however, there really is no off season
in Orlando. As the tourists begin their homeward journey, business
clients and the convention trade start pouring in, and they come in
droves. International visitors also keep things busy year-round. This
year-round popularity means that many hotels don’t offer a traditional
high- and low-season rate scale — and it also means that you need to
book your trip as early as possible.

My favorite time of year to head to Orlando is between September and
October. The crowds tend to be thinnest following the Labor Day week-
end and through the first two weeks of October as school is once again
back in session. Florida residents often scoot to the parks during this
time for a day trip or a long weekend. But most out-of-state guests don’t
have that luxury. If you have younger children, consider pulling them
out of school for a few days during the slower months to avoid the hor-
rendous lines. Ask their teachers for schoolwork to take with you. You
can also suggest that your kids write a report on an educational element
of the vacation. (And yes, they’ll actually learn something while they’re
traipsing around places like Innoventions: The Road to Tomorrow and
the World Showcase, both at Epcot, and the various marine life exhibits
at SeaWorld.)
Even if you come during the off season, the parks run close to full tilt,
although operating hours are generally markedly shorter. No matter
what time of year you find yourself heading to Orlando, you’ll want to be
aware of that season’s perks and pitfalls.
Spring: Excitement blooms in Orlando
Spring is sensational in Orlando because
 The weather is mild. Sunny days are followed by cool breezy
nights. By early spring, the flowers are beginning to bloom; they’re
bursting with color later in the season. If your hometown is still
blanketed by feet of snow, you’ll be in heaven.
 Accommodations often offer spring discounts (with the exception
of the weeks surrounding the Easter holiday, when rates can be at
their highest).
 The lines inside the theme parks are relatively short. Visit on a
weekday and your wait for a ride is likely to be less than 30 minutes
(again the exception being the two, sometimes three, weeks on
either side of the Easter holiday, which can bring with it some of
the longest lines of the year).
But keep in mind that
 Without a winter, spring is fleeting. The daytime hours can already
be hot and humid by late April, although the really sticky weather
doesn’t usually arrive until mid- to late May.
 The high pollen count can drive allergy sufferers crazy.
 April is, by far, one of the busiest months to visit, especially around
Easter. College students are headed down for their share of fun in
the sun, while families take advantage of the time off for travel.
Hotels are booked well in advance, the lines are, at times, unbear-
able, and the crowds border on intolerable. Everything — including
the roadways, restaurants, hotels, and parks — is jam-packed with
people.
Chapter 3: Deciding When to Go 27

Summer: Have fun in the Orlando sun
Summer is superb in Orlando because
 Daylight is plentiful, and most parks take full advantage by remain-
ing open until 9 p.m. or often later (10, 11, or even midnight clos-
ings are not out of the question), and long days are usually capped
off by spectacular nighttime fireworks displays.
 Crowds are manageable. Even though summer is one of the most
popular seasons, it pales in comparison to spring break and the
winter holidays. The weekends are busier than at almost any other
time of the year, but the weekdays bring a bit of relief.
 August brings with it back-to-school sales at Orlando’s many malls
and outlets.
 All hotels, major restaurants, and indoor tourist attractions in
Central Florida have air-conditioning.
 Orlando has some of the coolest pools and unique water parks.
Splashing around in any one of them makes for a fun way to beat
the heat.
However, keep in mind that
 Outside, the heat and humidity can be downright oppressive. The
phrase “I’m melllllllting!” takes on new meaning. Those with respi-
ratory problems would do best to avoid Orlando in summer, when
it may feel like you’re trying to breathe in a steam room.
 Crowds and sweat create a sometimes-unpleasant perfume in the
air. And with the UV index at its extreme, you’ll burn in less than 
20 minutes without a good sunscreen.
 There’s not much of a chance of getting discounts. Why should
anyone cut prices when everything is running at capacity?
Fall: Harvest good times in Orlando
Fall is fabulous in Orlando because
 With schools back in session, crowds are at their thinnest.
 Accommodations that do give discounts often offer them in the fall.
 With smaller crowds, wait times for lines can be 30 minutes or less.
In fact, I’ve sometimes gotten off a ride, only to turn around and
walk right back on.
Part I: Introducing Walt Disney World and Orlando 
28

But keep in mind that
 Although the weather is cooler, the temperature doesn’t get as mild
as spring until Thanksgiving or later.
 Shorter crowds mean shorter park hours. Closing times of 6 or 7
p.m. (sometimes even earlier) are not uncommon.
 When mid-December arrives, so do the higher prices.
Winter: You’ll be warm and welcome in Orlando
Winter is wonderful in Orlando because
 Orlando doesn’t have a true winter — although some nights
approach freezing temperatures, the days are still relatively mild
and sunny. January and February have the biggest temperature
swings. One day it can reach 80°F, the next it may only get into 
the 40s.
 With the exception of the holiday period from mid-December to
just after New Year’s — the busiest season of all — lines at the
parks don’t get much shorter than they do during this time of year.
However, remember that
 The many conventions held in Orlando throughout the year keep
room rates from plunging completely, and conventioneers can take
over entire hotels, sometimes making rooms hard to find.
 During the Thanksgiving and mid-December to early January holi-
days, the parks are just as crowded (if not more so) as summer
weekends.
Weather warnings
You don’t need to worry too much, but knowing a little about Florida’s
weather-related temper tantrums is a good idea. Here’s a list of weather
events that you may experience during your stay:
 Hurricanes: The Gulf and Atlantic hurricane seasons run from June
1 to November 30. In an average year, the Atlantic churns out ten of
these storms, and one or two touch Florida. The Gulf adds three to
five. The good news: Orlando’s inland location generally means the
worst a hurricane can do is ruin a couple days of vacation with
heavy rains and the occasional tornado. (That said, in Aug and Sept
of 2004, hurricanes Charley, Frances, and Jeanne swept through
Orlando, causing massive shutdowns and evacuations. Although
this was an extremely rare occurrence, it’s something to keep in
mind.)
Chapter 3: Deciding When to Go 29

 Lightning: This scary but beautiful show, courtesy of Mother
Nature, makes regular appearances during Orlando’s frequent
summer thunderstorms. Don’t let lightning ruin your trip, however.
Unless you go out of your way to attract it, lightning’s wrath likely
won’t bother you. Use common sense and you should be fine.
 Sun: Florida isn’t called the Sunshine State without good reason.
Make sure that you use plenty of sunscreen (an SPF of 30 or higher
is recommended) during your trip. Florida tourism thrives on the
sun, but you won’t enjoy your vacation much if you’re laid up with
a painful sunburn or, even worse, sun poisoning.
Sunburns can really ruin a fun day at the parks. Preventing your skin
from turning a magnificent, and painful, shade of red is simple: Slather
yourself and your kids (even the ones in covered strollers) with a sun-
block that has an SPF of at least 30 (SPF 50 is even better for the kids)
and that, preferably, contains zinc or titanium oxide. Pick a formula
that’s both waterproof and sweatproof. And don’t forget to keep re-
applying it, especially after you hit the swimming pool; every two hours
is best. Likewise, remember to bring a wide-brimmed hat and don’t
forget a Florida native’s favorite fashion statement — sunglasses.
To avoid dehydration, another vacation killer, drink more fluids than you
think you need. By the time you’re thirsty and cranky from walking
around in the heat, you’re already dehydrated. Ignoring these signs
could lead to heat exhaustion or worse. Avoid caffeinated or carbonated
beverages, as well as alcoholic drinks and those high in sugar — these
actually cause you to lose more body fluids. Sports drinks can supple-
ment fluids in your body, but water should be your first choice.
Freeze a couple of water bottles to bring along — they stay cold far
longer and save you a few dollars in the end (especially because you can
refill them at a drinking fountain for free throughout the day).
Take frequent breaks under the shade of a tree or in the comfort of air-
conditioning, especially if you have kids in tow. Wearing lightweight,
light-colored clothing will all help alleviate the affects of the searing 
sunshine.
If you’re looking for exact forecasts, go to www.weather.com the week of
your trip and use zip code 32830 to get a ten-day forecast for the area.

Orlando’s Calendar: Attractions in Review
In this section, I list (by month) just a few of Orlando’s many exciting fes-
tivals and special events. Please double-check with the festivals’ respec-
tive governing organizations before planning your vacation around any
of them. Event dates, as with everything else, are subject to change.
You can access the Orlando/Orange County Convention & Visitors
Bureau Web site at www.orlandoinfo.com for information about other
upcoming events.
January
The second-ranked teams from the Southeastern and Big Ten college
football conferences square off against each other at the annual Capital
One Florida Citrus Bowl. Tickets are $65 before November 1 and $75 up
until the day of the game. Call % 800-297-2695 or 407-423-2476 for infor-
mation or Ticketmaster at % 877-803-7073 or 407-839-3900 (on the
Internet, go to www.fcsports.com). January 1.
Why walk through the WDW parks when you can run the Walt Disney
World Marathon (% 407-939-7810; www.disneysports.com)? The 26.2-
mile course starts and ends at Epcot, winding through each of the other
Disney parks, as well as along the BoardWalk. Spots fill up fast, so sign
up as early as possible. The entrance fee will run you $100. A half-
marathon ($90), beginning at Epcot, making its way through the Magic
Kingdom, and ending back at Epcot, is an option for those not quite
ready for all 26.2 miles. If you’re up for the challenge of running both
races, sign up for Goofy’s Race and a Half Challenge ($190). Those with
children won’t be left behind as the 5K Family Fun Run ($25–$30) winds
around Disney–MGM Studios. Shorter kiddie races (each costs $5) take
place at the Wide World of Sports Complex. January 5, 6, and 7.

The four-day Zora Neale Hurston Festival (% 407-647-3307; www.zora
nealehurstonfestival.com) is celebrated in Eatonville, the first incor-
porated African-American town in America. It highlights the life and
works of author Zora Neale Hurston. Eatonville is 25 miles north of the
parks. Admission is $5 to $20 adults, $3 kids ages 4 to 17. Lectures, semi-
nars, and special events are extra. Last weekend in January.
February
Authentic parade floats from New Orleans, stilt walkers, and traditional
doubloons and beads add to all the fun at Mardi Gras at Universal
Studios Florida (% 800-837-2273 or 407-363-8000; www.universal
orlando.com). Not unlike the original celebration, this party is flowing
with plenty of alcohol, making it more of an adult-oriented event —
though, thankfully, you don’t have to show any skin to get beads thrown
at you. Nationally known bands and artists ranging from KC and the
Sunshine Band to Kid Rock play the stage inside the park. All Mardi Gras
events are included in the regular price of admission to the park. Select
Saturday nights from mid-February to mid-March.
The Atlanta Braves head south for spring training to Disney’s Wide
World of Sports Complex. They play a 16-game spring season that
begins in early March. Tickets are $14 to $22. For general information,
call % 407-939-4263 or check online at www.disneysports.com. To
purchase tickets, call Ticketmaster at % 877-803-7073 or 407-839-3900.
You can also get information online at www.atlantabraves.com or
www.majorleaguebaseball.com. Late February to March.
March
The ten-day Florida Film Festival (% 407-644-6579 or 407-629-1088;
www.floridafilmfestival.com or www.enzian.org), showcasing the
year’s best independent and foreign films, has become one of the most
respected regional film events in the country. Single-film tickets are $9,
with special ticket packages also available. Mid-March.
Spanning two weekends in March, SeaWorld’s BBQ Fest (%
800-423-8368; www.seaworldorlando.com) features a great barbecue
and performances by popular country artists. The concerts are included
with regular park admission, but if you’re hankering a mouth-watering
meal, you’ll have to pay extra. Mid-March.
Also in mid-March, you can enjoy the wonderful Winter Park Sidewalk
Arts Festival (% 407-672-6390; www.wpsaf.org), which is rated as one
of the nation’s most prestigious fine-arts festivals and draws artists from
all over North America. Each year, more than 350,000 people enjoy this
free three-day event filled with art, food, children’s activities, and per-
formances by nationally recognized jazz artists. March 16 through 18.

April
From garden beds color-coordinated to form those famous Mickey ears
to whimsical topiaries specially grown and groomed to take the shape of
Disney’s classic characters, the six-week Epcot International Flower
and Garden Festival (% 407-934-7639; www.disneyworld.com) is
geared toward those with an appreciation of what Disney can do to
Mother Nature’s finest foliage. Nightly classic-rock and pop concerts are
featured at the America Gardens Theater near the American Pavilion.
Included with regular Epcot admission. Late-April to early June.
May
More than 100 acts from around the world participate in the eclectic 
ten-day Orlando International Fringe Festival (% 407-648-0077; www.
orlandofringe.org), which takes place at various locations in down-
town Orlando. Entertainers perform everything from drama to political
satire, experimental theater to Hamlet. Ticket prices vary, but most per-
formances are generally around $10. Usually starts third week of May.
Whether you’re a Jedi-in-training or a Darth Vader wannabe, the Force
will be with you during the four Star Wars Weekends at Disney–MGM
Studios (% 407-934-7639; www.disneyworld.com). In addition to vari-
ous Star Wars–themed shows and parades, each weekend features meet-
and-greets with actual actors from the movies such as Anthony Daniels
(C-3PO), Peter Mayhew (Chewbacca), and Jake Lloyd (young Anakin
Skywalker). Included with regular Disney–MGM admission. Begins in
mid-May.
June
Gay Days (www.gayday.com or www.gaydays.com) draws tens of thou-
sands of gay and lesbian travelers to Central Florida. This event began in
1991 as an unofficial event at Disney World that ended up attracting
50,000 people. It has expanded to a weeklong celebration during which
Universal Orlando and SeaWorld also host events. Keep in mind that
red is the color of choice for event-goers during this week, and Saturday
is when they descend en masse on the Magic Kingdom. First weekend in
June.
July
Orlando heats up as Independence Day is celebrated with bands,
singers, dancers, and unbelievable fireworks displays at Disney’s Star-
Spangled Spectacular (% 407-824-4321; www.disneyworld.com). The
parks stay open late for the occasion. SeaWorld (% 407-351-3600;
www.seaworld.com) exhibits a dazzling laser/fireworks spectacular, as
does Universal Orlando (% 407-363-8000; www.universalorlando.
com). Orlando’s Lake Eola Park (% 407-246-2827; www.cityoforlando.
net) features activities and entertainment throughout the late afternoon,
Chapter 3: Deciding When to Go 33

as well as a free nighttime fireworks display. Local radio station WXXL
hosts an annual Fourth of July concert (% 407-916-7800; www.wxxl.
com) in Altamonte Springs that brings in Top-40 radio acts, such as
Jessica Simpson, to play for thousands of people outdoors. July 4th.
September
One weekend each September, the Magic Kingdom plays host to a con-
temporary Christian and Gospel music festival, Night of Joy, featuring
top artists (% 407-824-4321; www.disneyworld.com/nightofjoy).
This event is very popular, so get tickets early. Admission to the concert
is separately ticketed from regular admission; Magic Kingdom attrac-
tions are included. Ticket prices are $40 (one night), $68 (two nights).
September 8 and 9.
Universal goes head-to-head with Disney, scheduling its Rock the
Universe Christian music concert the very same weekend (% 800-837-
2273; www.rocktheuniverse.com). Tickets are $37 for one night or $60
for both nights; admission includes entrance to Universal Studios after 4
p.m., the concerts, and full use of the park’s rides and attractions until 1
a.m. Combination tickets that include all-day park admission are also
available. September 8 and 9.
Later in the month, SeaWorld offers a weekend of sensational music,
concerts, dance, food sampling, and crafts to celebrate Hispanic 
culture in Florida at its Viva La Musica (% 800-423-8368; www.sea
worldorlando.com). Admission is included with regular park admis-
sion. Last weekend in September.
October
At Epcot’s six-week International Food and Wine Festival (% 407-824-
4321; www.disneyworld.com), you have the chance to sip and savor
the food and beverages of 30 countries for the paltry sum of $1.50 to
$4.50 per sample. Events include wine-tastings, seminars, concerts, and
celebrity-chef cooking demonstrations. Some specially ticketed dinners
or wine-tastings are available at prices ranging from $35 to $200. You
must be 21 or over to enjoy the libations, but all ages can enjoy the culi-
nary treats. September 29 to mid-November.
Orlando is frightfully fun in October as Islands of Adventure transforms
its grounds with haunted attractions for 20 or so nights in honor of
Universal Orlando’s Halloween Horror Nights (% 800-837-2273 or
407-363-8000; www.universalorlando.com). Complete with live bands,
special shows, a psychopath’s maze, and hundreds of ghouls and gob-
lins roaming the streets, the studio closes at dusk and then reopens in a
new, chilling form at 7 p.m. The park charges full adult admission ($63)
for this event (children under 10 aren’t permitted), which lasts until
Part I: Introducing Walt Disney World and Orlando 
34

about midnight. Guests aren’t allowed to wear costumes so that
Universal employees can spot their peers. This event tends to sell out,
especially nearer to Halloween, so get your tickets early. Select nights in
October.
If your young ones are more into treats than tricks for Halloween,
Mickey hosts the annual Mickey’s Not-So-Scary Halloween Party 
(% 407-824-4321; www.disneyworld.com) at the Magic Kingdom,
complete with Mickey’s “Boo-to-You” Halloween Parade and Happy
HalloWishes fireworks display. Each guest is also given a Halloween bag,
and, throughout the park, cast members hand out treats. This is a sepa-
rately ticketed event held after regular park closing, but most attractions
are open. Tickets are $37 for adults and $30 for children 9 or younger
(add $6 per ticket the day of the event). This event tends to sell out,
especially nearer to Halloween, so get your tickets early (they go on sale
in May!). Select nights in October.
Family-friendly festivities at SeaWorld’s Halloween Spooktacular
(% 407-363-2259; www.seaworld.com) include themed parades, cos-
tumed characters, and spooky shows appropriate for kids of all ages.
Kids can even trick-or-treat at specified stations throughout the park.
The bonus here is that everything is included with your regular park
admission. Select weekends in October.
November
Soap-opera fanatics from all over the world descend upon Disney–MGM
Studios during the ABC Super Soap Weekend (% 407-824-4321; www.
disneyworld.com) to get up-close-and-personal with their favorite stars
from ABC’s long-running soaps — All My Children, One Life to Live, and
General Hospital. The event is included with regular park admission.
First weekend of November.
Downtown Disney Marketplace is home to the Festival of the Masters
(% 407-824-4321; www.disneyworld.com), one of the largest art shows
in the South. The exhibition features top artists, photographers, and
craftspeople — all winners of juried shows throughout the United States.
Admission to the festival is free to all. Second weekend in November.
December
During the Disney Christmas festivities, Main Street in the Magic
Kingdom is lavishly decked out with lights and holly, and carolers wel-
come visitors. Thousands of colored lights illuminate an 80-foot tree.
Epcot and Animal Kingdom also offer special embellishments and enter-
tainment throughout the holiday season, as do all Disney resorts.
Disney–MGM Studios offers the world-famous Osbourne Family
Spectacle of Lights. One holiday highlight includes Mickey’s Very Merry
Chapter 3: Deciding When to Go 35

Christmas Party, an after-dark ticketed event, which takes place on
weekends at the Magic Kingdom and offers a traditional Christmas
parade and fireworks display. Admission ($46 adults, $38 kids 3 to 9;
advance purchase for select nights saves $6 per ticket) includes cookies,
cocoa, and a souvenir photo. The best part? Shorter lines for rides.
Another holiday highlight is the Candlelight Procession at Epcot, which
features hundreds of candle-holding carolers, a celebrity narrator telling
the Christmas story, and a 450-voice choir that’s very moving. Regular
park admission is required, but special dinner packages include special
seating for the event ($31–$46 for adults, depending on the Epcot restau-
rant chosen; $13 for kids 3–9, regardless of restaurant). Call % 407-824-
4321 for details on these events or visit www.disneyworld.com. Dates
vary, but most events are staged at various times in December.

eveloping a realistic budget is an important key to enjoying your
vacation. The last thing you want to experience when you get to
Orlando is sticker shock — Central Florida is famous for its ability to
exact a pound of flesh from even the most cost-conscious traveler. From
hotel rooms to meal tabs to admission fees, you can easily break the
bank if you don’t do some homework and set some limits in advance.
The good news is that there are ways to avoid blowing your bankroll,
and I show them to you in this chapter.
Planning Your Budget
When it comes to your Orlando vacation, working out a budget may be
the single most important thing you do. The hard part is sticking to it
after you’ve been swept up in all the excitement. Mickey and his pals are
masters when it comes to separating you from your money. But by using
the tips I give you, you can come up with a pretty accurate estimate of
what a trip to Mickey’s place may cost you.
When making your budget, be sure to include every possible expense,
especially hidden charges that, unless you specifically ask, are almost
never quoted when you inquire about hotel or rental-car rates, attrac-
tion admissions, and restaurant prices. Florida sales taxes, which run
from 6.5 percent on merchandise to almost 25 percent on rental cars, 
are chief on the list of these hidden charges. For more information, see
“Taxes” in the Quick Concierge.
Another hidden expense many travelers fail to budget for is tips. Orlando
is a tip-happy place. A 15-percent tip is the general rule for restaurant
service and cab rides. The hotel housekeeper deserves $1 to $2 a day for
cleaning your mess, making your beds, and keeping you stocked with
towels and toilet paper. Baggage handlers usually receive at least $1 per
bag. And don’t forget about a $1 to $2 tip for valet parking.

Most of your Orlando vacation expenses fall into six categories:
 Lodging: The average rack rate for a three-star hotel in Orlando is
about $88 per night (see Chapter 9). In most cases, those rates
include any children younger than 12, and usually younger than 18,
staying in your room. The lowest rates at WDW are those at the All-
Star Resorts, which, depending on the season, run from $79 to
$137. They’re pricier than comparable rooms in the outside world;
they’re tiny, basic, and heavily themed, but they’re on Disney soil.
 Transportation: Some hotels offer free shuttles to the parks; others
take you for a fee (see Chapter 8 for more information). If you stay
at Disney, you can access its free transportation system (though it’s
plodding). Rental-car rates start at about $35 a day after you’ve
tossed in Florida’s various taxes and surcharges (which can total
up to 20–25 percent above the quoted rate). And don’t forget to add
the $10 daily charge to park your car at the theme parks — though
you won’t have to pay this at the Disney parks if you’re a guest at
one of Mickey’s resorts. If you’re a fan of valet parking, add at least
$7 to $18 per day (and possibly a whole lot more) for fees and tips.
If you’re flying into Orlando, don’t forget to add the cost of getting
to the airport, airport parking (if you’re driving yourself), airline
tickets (you can find tips for getting the best airfare in Chapter 5),
and transportation from the Orlando airport to your room (unless
you’re staying with Mickey and take Disney’s Magical Express —
see Chapter 9 for details). If you’re driving to Orlando, be sure to
include your fuel costs and tolls.
 Dining: Satisfying your stomach in Orlando is the biggest variable in
your budget, and outside of admissions and tickets, it can easily end
up being your biggest expense. If you’re happy with a diet of nothing
but fast food, expect an average of $30 to $40 per person, per day.
Adding one or two restaurant meals jumps the average up to $40 to
$60 per person, per day, including tax and tip; and expect to spend
$60 or more per person if you dine mostly in the theme parks or at
Disney’s and Universal’s resorts, where prices are almost 25 percent
higher than those in the outside world. (See Chapter 10 for more
information on dining.) Keep in mind that food in the parks and
resorts is overpriced and is average at best (though there are excep-
tions). Outside the parks, you can find delis and pizzerias for take-
out as well as assorted budget-minded eateries.
 Attractions: Your expenses for attractions depend on which parks
you plan to visit and how many days you spend at each. When you
throw in sales tax, Disney, Universal, and SeaWorld charge approxi-
mately $65 per adult and around $55 per child age 3 to 9, per day.
(See Chapters 12–16 and Chapters 18–20 for information about the
individual parks.) If you’re planning to visit any of these parks more
than once, buying a multiday and, in some cases, multipark pass is
the by far the best way to go. Chapter 21 also includes some less
expensive and even free attractions that you can visit if you want to
cut your costs and broaden your experiences.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Walt Disney World and Orlando 
40

 Shopping: Orlando is a shopper’s paradise, with several large malls
and outlets (see Chapter 22) and an array of souvenir shops to
choose from. The amusement-park gift shops are notorious for
inflating prices on souvenirs, and although I don’t recommend pick-
ing up more than a couple of souvenirs at the parks, be prepared
for their ability to lure you in. Budget accordingly.
 Nightlife: If you stick to the theme-park options, plan on dropping
anywhere from $5 to $21 for admission to the various nightspots,
but after including a few $5 beers, your total can easily reach $30 to
$40 for a night on the town. (See Chapter 25 for information about
the various park nightlife options.) If you have a car (rental or your
own), you can take advantage of downtown options, which can be
slightly less expensive, at around $20 to $30 for cover charges and
a few beers.
After estimating your expenses, be sure to tack on another 15 to 20 per-
cent to your budget as a safety net — a pair of fuzzy light-up Mickey ears
are bound to be calling the name of someone in your group.

Cutting Costs — But Not the Fun
You can conserve your cash in a variety of ways when you vacation in
Orlando. Using these tips can keep your costs manageable:
 Visit off season. Hotel prices in the off season (Sept–Nov or
Apr–early June) can be substantially lower, depending on the 
property.
 Travel midweek. If you can travel on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or
Thursday, you may find cheaper flights to your destination. When
you ask about airfares, see if you can get a cheaper rate by flying on
a different day. For more tips on getting a good fare, see Chapter 5.
 Try a package tour. For many Orlando destinations, you can book
airfare, hotel, ground transportation, and even some additional
perks just by making one call to a travel agent or packager, for a
price much less than if you put the trip together yourself. (See
Chapter 5 for more on package tours.)
 Ask whether your kids can stay in the room with you. A room
with two double beds usually doesn’t cost any more than one with
a queen-size bed. And many hotels don’t charge you the additional-
person rate if the additional person is pint-size and related to you.
Many Orlando hotels offer “suites” with bunk beds or separate
sleeping areas for kids. They may cost more than a regular room,
but even if you have to pay extra for the extra space or a rollaway
bed, you can save hundreds by not taking two rooms.
 Reserve a room with a refrigerator and coffeemaker. You don’t
have to slave over a hot stove to cut costs; several hotels have
minifridges, coffeemakers, and even a microwave. Buying supplies
for breakfast saves you money — and probably calories.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Walt Disney World and Orlando 
42

 Don’t bunk with Mickey. This one may be hard to swallow for
those who want to immerse themselves in all things Disney. And if
your vacation can’t be complete without a stay on Walt Disney
World property, then by all means go for it. But if you’re on a tight
budget, you can stay in some wonderful, themed (albeit, non-
Mickey) properties for considerably less than you would pay for
the cheapest Disney hotels.
 Take advantage of your in-and-out privileges if you have a multi-
day pass to a theme park. Go back to your hotel for a picnic lunch
and a swim or nap. You can eat economically, avoid the midday
sun, and refuel for an afternoon or, in some cases, an evening at the
park without having to pay admission fees again.
 Avoid splurging — pace yourself. Your money goes fastest when
you overexert yourself exploring the parks, and you end up too
hungry, thirsty, or tired to care about how much you spend. Be
sure to schedule rest breaks throughout the day and begin each
day with a big breakfast (several hotels offer spreads that are
included in their room rates). You can find several buffets outside
the parks for around $4 to $6 (see Chapter 10).
 Brown-bag it. Bringing your own food is extremely cost-effective.
The parks are wise to this scheme and many don’t allow coolers,
but they generally ignore it when you aren’t obvious about it, so
make your operation covert — hide food in a fanny pack or back-
pack. If you don’t want to schlep food, do bring drinks or stop often
at drinking fountains — the bottled water and soda prices in the
parks can have you wondering if the theme parks are selling liquid
gold instead of Coke.
 Try expensive restaurants at lunch instead of dinner. Lunch tabs
are usually a fraction of what dinner costs at a top restaurant, and
the menu often boasts many of the same specialties.
 Don’t rent a gas guzzler. Renting a smaller car is cheaper, and you
save on gas to boot. For more on car rentals, see Chapter 7.
 Don’t spend every day at a theme park. Discover your hotel’s
pool, playground, workout room, and other freebies, or head out of
town to a state park, beach, or one of the lower-priced attractions
away from theme-park central.
 Skip the souvenirs. Your photographs and your memories could be
the best mementos of your trip. If you’re concerned about money,
you can do without the T-shirts and other trinkets.
 Surf the Web. The Web site www.mousesavers.com keeps track of
almost all available discounts for Disney-related vacations (from
room discount codes to special packages and promotions). If you
want to stay at a Disney resort, MouseSavers.com will likely help
you save money doing it.

 Receive instant discounts with an Orlando Preferred Visitor
Magicard. The Orlando Magicard is good for up to $500 in dis-
counts on accommodations, car rentals, attractions, and more.
Better yet, the card is free. You can get a Magicard from the
Orlando/Orange County Convention & Visitors Bureau, 8723
International Dr., Suite 101, Orlando, FL 32819 (% 800-643-9492 or
407-363-5872; www.orlandoinfo.com/magicard/index.cfm). You
may also be eligible for other discounts if you’re a member of
AARP, AAA, the military, or service clubs, so don’t be bashful —
just ask.
Handling Money
You’re the best judge of how much cash you feel comfortable carrying or
what alternative form of currency is your favorite. That’s not going to
change much on your vacation. True, you’ll probably be moving around
more and incurring more expenses than you generally do (unless you
happen to eat out every meal when you’re at home), and you may let
your mind slip into vacation gear and not be as vigilant about your
safety as when you’re in work mode. But, those factors aside, the only
type of payment that won’t be quite as available to you away from home
is your personal checkbook.
Using ATMs and carrying cash
The easiest and best way to get cash away from home is from an 
automated teller machine (ATM). The Cirrus (% 800-424-7787;
www.mastercard.com) and PLUS (% 800-843-7587; www.visa.com)
ATM networks span the globe; look at the back of your bank card to see
which network you’re on, and then call or check online for ATM loca-
tions at your destination. You can find ATMs at all of Orlando’s major
theme parks; check the guide map you get upon entering each park for
locations.
Keep in mind that many banks impose a fee every time your card is used
at a different bank’s ATM. In Florida, you’re assessed an average charge
of $2.75 when you use an ATM that isn’t affiliated with your bank. (That’s
on top of any fees your bank may charge.)
Be extremely careful when using ATMs, especially at night and in areas
that are heavily traveled but not well lighted. Don’t let the land of
Mickey lull you into a false sense of security. Minnie and Goofy won’t
mug you — but thieves working the theme-park zones may.

Charging ahead with credit cards
Credit cards are a safe way to carry money: They also provide a conven-
ient record of all your expenses and generally offer relatively good
exchange rates. You can also withdraw cash advances from your credit
cards at banks or ATMs, provided you know your PIN. If you forgot
yours, or didn’t even know you had one, call the number on the back of
your credit card, and ask the bank to send it to you. It usually takes five
to seven business days, though some banks provide the number over
the phone if you tell them your mother’s maiden name or some other
personal information.
Keep in mind that you start paying interest on credit-card cash advances
the minute you get them and it’s generally much higher than the rate for
charging your purchases.
Toting traveler’s checks
These days, traveler’s checks are less necessary because most cities
have 24-hour ATMs that allow you to withdraw small amounts of cash as
needed. However, keep in mind that you will likely be charged an ATM
withdrawal fee if the bank is not your own. So if you’re withdrawing
money every day, you may be better off with traveler’s checks — pro-
vided that you don’t mind showing identification every time you want to
cash one. All the major theme parks and resorts accept traveler’s checks
from major banks.
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 45
Dollars — Disney-style
Walt Disney World theme parks and some resorts offer their own way of paying. You
can use your electronic room key as a debit card in Disney’s shops and restaurants —
items are charged directly to your room.
Although I don’t recommend doing so, you can buy Disney Dollars (currency with cute
little pictures of Mickey, Goofy, or Minnie on it) at the resorts or the Guest Services
desk in each of the parks. The bills come in $1, $5, and $10 denominations, and they’re
good at shops, restaurants, and resorts throughout Walt Disney World and in Disney
Stores elsewhere on the planet. This currency provides no real benefit other than its
negligible souvenir value. If you want to trade Disney Dollars for real currency upon
leaving, you end up facing — you guessed it! — one more line in the theme parks.
Be advised that refunds for deposits on wheelchairs, strollers, and such in the theme
parks are often paid in Disney Dollars. But if you’re persistent, you can get your refunds
in Uncle Sam’s currency, instead of Mickey’s.

If you choose to carry traveler’s checks, be sure to keep a record of their
serial numbers separate from your checks in case they’re stolen or lost.
You’ll get a refund faster if you know the numbers.
Dealing with a lost or stolen wallet
Be sure to contact all your credit-card companies the minute you dis-
cover your wallet has been lost or stolen and file a report at the nearest
police precinct. Your credit-card company or insurer may require a
police report number or record of the loss. Most credit-card companies
have an emergency toll-free number to call if your card is lost or stolen;
they may be able to wire you a cash advance immediately or deliver an
emergency credit card in a day or two. Call the following emergency
numbers in the United States:
 American Express: % 800-221-7282 (for cardholders and trav-
eler’s check holders)
 MasterCard: % 800-307-7309 or 636-722-7111
 Visa: % 800-847-2911 or 410-581-9994
For other credit cards, call the toll-free number directory at % 800-
555-1212.
If you need emergency cash over the weekend when all banks and
American Express offices are closed, you can have money wired to you
via Western Union (% 800-325-6000; www.westernunion.com).
Identity theft or fraud is a potential complication of losing your wallet,
especially if you’ve lost your driver’s license along with your credit
cards. Notify the major credit-reporting bureaus immediately; placing a
fraud alert on your records may protect you against liability for criminal
activity. The three major U.S. credit-reporting agencies are Equifax
(% 800-766-0008; www.equifax.com), Experian (% 888-397-3742;
www.experian.com), and TransUnion (% 800-680-7289; www.
transunion.com). Finally, if you lose all forms of photo ID, call your 
airline and explain the situation; they may allow you to board the plane
if you have a copy of your passport or birth certificate and a copy of the
police report you’ve filed.

etting to your destination isn’t always half the fun of your trip, but
you can choose ways to get from point A to point B without too
much hassle or expense. In this chapter, I eliminate the travel double
talk, shed the useless options, and make sure that you have a fun and
easy time planning your getaway.
Flying to Orlando
Getting to Orlando by plane is a breeze. Almost every major domestic
airline offers direct service to Mickeyville from most major cities in the
United States and Canada. A number of international carriers also fly
direct from several major European and South American cities.
Finding out which airlines fly there
If you’re flying to Orlando, the best place to land is Orlando International
Airport (% 407-825-2001; www.orlandoairports.net). The airport,
which locals refer to as OIA (confusingly, the official airport code is
MCO), offers direct or nonstop service from approximately 60 U.S. and
25 international cities. About 40 scheduled airlines and several charters
feed more than 33 million people through its gates annually. For a list of
all the major airlines that fly into the city, see “Toll-Free Numbers and
Web Sites” in the Quick Concierge.
The sheer number of flights in and out of its gates makes OIA the top
dog as far as local airports go, and its location reinforces that even
more. The airport connects to highways, Interstate 4, and toll roads that
get you (whether you’re driving or being driven) into the heart of it all
within 30 or 40 minutes (fewer if you’re headed into downtown Orlando).
If a proposed train running from the airport to the theme park zones
ever gets built, OIA will become that much more convenient.

Orlando Sanford International Airport (% 407-585-4500; www.orlando
sanfordairport.com) is much smaller than OIA, but it has grown a bit
in recent years, thanks mainly to a small fleet of international carriers
including Thomsonfly and Thomas Cook Airlines, as well as regional
airlines such as Allegiant Air. Although you may save money flying into
Sanford International, it has some drawbacks: The flight schedules aren’t
always convenient; the airlines using the airport don’t serve all that
many cities; and you definitely need a rental car — the airport is on the
northern side of Orlando, well over 45 minutes from Walt Disney World.
Getting the best deal on your airfare
Competition among the major U.S. airlines is unlike that of any other
industry. Every airline offers virtually the same product (basically, a
coach seat is a coach seat is a . . . ), yet prices can vary by hundreds of
dollars.
Business travelers who need the flexibility to buy their tickets at the last
minute and change their itineraries at a moment’s notice — and who
want to get home before the weekend — pay (or at least their companies
pay) the premium rate, otherwise known as the full fare. But if you can
book your ticket far in advance, can stay over Saturday night, and are
willing to travel midweek (Tues, Wed, or Thurs), you can take advantage
of far-less-expensive ticket prices — usually only a fraction of the full
fare. On most flights, even the shortest hops within the United States,
can cost upwards of $1,000 or more, but a 7- or 14-day advance-purchase
ticket may cost half that amount, possibly even less. Obviously, planning
ahead pays.
The airlines also periodically hold sales, in which they lower the prices
on their most popular routes. These fares have advance-purchase
requirements and date-of-travel restrictions, but you can’t beat the
prices. As you plan your vacation, keep your eyes open for these sales,
which tend to take place in seasons of low travel volume — September
to November and April to early June. You almost never see a sale around
the peak summer vacation months of July and August, or around
Thanksgiving or Christmas, when many people fly, regardless of the fare
they have to pay.
Another option is to fly on one of several no-frills airlines — low fares
but no amenities — that service Orlando. The biggest is Southwest
Airlines (% 800-435-9792; www.southwest.com), which has flights from
many U.S. cities to Orlando. Spirit Airlines (% 800-772-7117; www.spirit
air.com) offers a good selection of flights (several of them cross-
country) to Orlando out of several U.S. cities. JetBlue Airways (% 800-
538-2583; www.jetblue.com) is a low-cost carrier that operates mostly
on the East Coast but offers a number of routes from the West Coast.
Ted Airlines (% 800-225-5833; www.flyted.com), an offshoot of 
United Airlines, frequents Orlando from several U.S. cities, many offering
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Walt Disney World and Orlando 
48

nonstop flights. AirTran Airways (% 800-247-8726; www.airtran.com)
regularly has sales on routes to Orlando from around the country and
offers the option to upgrade to business class on most flights at the gate
for between $35 and $120 per segment depending on the length of your
flight or if you have a connection. Most of these so called no-frills air-
lines actually offer more in the way of extras than many of the larger car-
riers do, given all the cutbacks and reductions in service of late, making
them an all-around good buy.
Booking your flight online
The “big three” online travel agencies — Expedia (www.expedia.com),
Travelocity (www.travelocity.com), and Orbitz (www.orbitz.com) —
sell most of the air tickets bought on the Internet. (Canadian travelers
should try www.expedia.ca and www.travelocity.ca; U.K. residents
can go for expedia.co.uk and opodo.co.uk.) Each has different busi-
ness deals with the airlines and may offer different fares on the same
flights, so shopping around is wise. Expedia and Travelocity will also
send you an e-mail notification when a cheap fare becomes available to
your favorite destination. Of the smaller travel-agency Web sites,
SideStep (www.sidestep.com) receives good reviews from users. It’s a
browser add-on that purports to “search 140 sites at once,” but in reality
it only beats competitors’ fares as often as other sites do.
Great last-minute deals are available through free weekly e-mail services
provided directly by the airlines. Most of these deals are announced on
Tuesday or Wednesday and must be purchased online. Most are only
valid for travel that weekend, but some (such as Southwest’s) can be
booked weeks or months in advance. Sign up for weekly e-mail alerts at
airline Web sites or check mega-sites that compile comprehensive lists
of last-minute specials, such as Smarter Travel (www.smartertravel.
com). For last-minute trips, Site59 (www.site59.com) in the United
States and LastMinute.com (www.lastminute.com) in Europe and the
United States often have better deals than the major-label sites.
If you’re willing to give up some control over your flight details, use an
opaque fare service like Priceline (www.priceline.com) or Hotwire
(www.hotwire.com). Both offer rock-bottom prices in exchange for
travel on a “mystery airline” at a mysterious time of day, often with a
mysterious change of planes en route. The mystery airlines are all 
major, well-known carriers — and the possibility of being sent from
Philadelphia to Orlando via Omaha is remote. But your chances of get-
ting a 6 a.m. or 11 p.m. flight are pretty high. Hotwire tells you flight
prices before you buy; Priceline usually has better deals than Hotwire,
but you have to play its “Name Your Own Price” game. Note: In 2004,
Priceline added non-opaque service to its roster. You now have the
option to pick exact flights, times, and airlines from a list of offers — or
opt to bid on opaque fares as before.
Chapter 5: Getting to Orlando 49

Great last-minute deals are also available directly from the airlines them-
selves through a free e-mail service called E-savers. Each week, the air-
line sends you a list of discounted flights, usually leaving the upcoming
Friday or Saturday and returning the following Monday or Tuesday. 
You can sign up for all the major airlines at one time by logging on to
Smarter Travel (www.smartertravel.com), or you can go to each indi-
vidual airline’s Web site and sign up. Airline sites also offer schedules,
flight booking, and information on late-breaking bargains.
Driving to Orlando
Driving to Orlando is sometimes a less expensive and potentially more
scenic option, unless the distance is so great that making the road trip
eats up too much of your vacation (and, thanks to rising gas prices, your
budget as well).

AAA (% 800-222-1134; www.aaa.com) and some other automobile clubs
offer free maps and optimum driving directions to their members
(among several other worthwhile travel perks). In addition, several com-
prehensive Web sites offer door-to-door driving directions with person-
alized map routing, including Google Maps (http://maps.google.
com), MapQuest (www.mapquest.com), and Yahoo! Maps (http://
maps.yahoo.com).
Arriving by Train
Amtrak (% 800-872-7245; www.amtrak.com) trains pull into two central
stations: 1400 Sligh Blvd. in downtown Orlando (about 23 miles from
Walt Disney World) and 111 E. Dakin Ave. in Kissimmee (about 15 miles
from Walt Disney World).
Amtrak’s Auto Train allows you to bring your car to Florida without
having to drive it all the way. The service begins in Lorton, Virginia —
about a four-hour drive from New York, two hours from Philadelphia —
and ends at Sanford, Florida, about 23 miles northeast of Orlando.
Reserve early for the lowest prices. Fares begin at $690 ($1,400 with a
berth) for two passengers and one auto. Call Amtrak for more details.
As with airfares, you can sometimes get discounts if you book train rides
far in advance. But you may find some restrictions on travel dates for
discounted train fares, mostly around the very busy holiday periods. If
you’re willing to travel off season, however, and spend four or more of
your vacation days in transit, you can score rare deals like an offer listed
a while back for a Los Angeles–Orlando round-trip for $50. Amtrak also
offers money-saving packages, including accommodations (some at
WDW resorts), car rentals, tours, and so on. For vacation package infor-
mation, call % 877-937-7245.
Chapter 5: Getting to Orlando 51

Choosing a Package Tour
For popular destinations, such as Walt Disney World, package tours can
be a smart way to go. In many cases, a package tour that includes air-
fare, hotel, and transportation to and from the airport costs less than
the hotel alone on a tour you book yourself. That’s because packages are
sold in bulk to tour operators, who then resell them to the public. It’s
kind of like buying your vacation at a buy-in-bulk store — except the
tour operator is the one who buys the 1,000-count box of candy bars and
resells them 10 at a time at a cost that undercuts the local supermarket.
Package tours can vary as much as those candy bars, too. Some offer a
better class of hotel than others; others provide the same hotels for
lower prices. Some book flights on scheduled airlines; others sell char-
ters. Some packages limit your choice of accommodations and travel
days.
If you choose to buy a package, think strongly about purchasing travel
insurance, especially when the tour operator asks you to pay up front.
But don’t buy insurance from the tour operator! If it doesn’t fulfill its
obligation to provide you with the vacation you’ve paid for, you have no
reason to think it’ll fulfill its insurance obligations either. Obtain travel
insurance through an independent agency. See Chapter 7 for more infor-
mation about buying travel insurance.
Where can I find travel packages?
To find package tours, check out the travel section of your local Sunday
newspaper or the ads in the back of national travel magazines such as
Travel + Leisure, National Geographic Traveler, and Condé Nast Traveler.
Liberty Travel (% 888-271-1584; www.libertytravel.com) is one of
the biggest packagers in the Northeast and usually boasts a full-page ad
in Sunday papers.
Another good source of package deals is the airlines themselves. Most
major airlines offer air/land packages, including American Airlines
Vacations (% 800-321-2121; www.aavacations.com), Continental
Airlines Vacations (% 800-301-3800; www.covacations.com), Delta
Vacations (% 800-221-6666; www.deltavacations.com), NWA
WorldVacations (% 800-800-1504; www.nwaworldvacations.com), and
United Vacations (% 888-854-3899; www.unitedvacations.com).
Several big online travel agencies — Expedia, Travelocity, Orbitz, Site59,
and LastMinute.com — also do a brisk business in packages. If you’re
unsure about the pedigree of a smaller packager, check with the Better
Business Bureau in the city where the company is based, or go to www.
bbb.org. If a packager won’t tell you where it’s based, don’t fly with that
company.

Theme-park offerings
Disney offers a dizzying array of packages that can include airfare,
accommodations on or off Disney property, theme-park passes, a rental
car, meals, and a Disney cruise. Disney offers seasonal packages, as well
as special themed vacations, including, but not limited to, golf, honey-
moons, spa makeovers, and so on.
Here are some of the plusses of booking a Disney package tour:
 Using Disney as your source for an all-Disney vacation is hard to
beat. The company’s Web site (www.disneyworld.com) offers spe-
cial planning tools that help visitors design and price their own
Disney vacation packages. There’s even a “Magical Gatherings”
option for families and large groups traveling together that offers
special planning tips and features.
 Nobody knows the Diz better than its own staffers.
 Disney reps can offer rooms in all price ranges ($79 and up).
 New ticketing options allow far more flexibility than ever before, so
you don’t end up with all that extra stuff you really don’t want.
However, be aware of the following drawbacks to Disney package deals:
 Resort guests receive the same perks, whether you buy your
Disney package from Disney or someone else (and sometimes other
places, such as AAA, offer additional perks to people who book
with them instead of directly with Disney).
 You have to prod Disney reservation agents for details. If you don’t
ask about deals to begin with, the agents frequently don’t volunteer
suggestions, such as the possibility that you can save money if you
start your Disney vacation a day earlier or later.
 Some WDW package perks aren’t always worth the extra money
you pay in the package price. For example, if they say you get your
picture taken with Mickey as part of the deal, expect that you can
find a better deal elsewhere and pay for your own photo. What
you’re really paying for is the convenience of having Disney plan
the details.
 If you want to see more of Orlando than WDW (and most people
do), you need to compare the offerings of a Disney agent with those
of a regular travel agent. A motivated travel agent can put together
a package of Disney and non-Disney accommodations and attrac-
tions for less than the amount WDW charges.
Chapter 5: Getting to Orlando 53

For detailed information on Disney packages, contact Walt Disney World,
Box 10000, Lake Buena Vista, FL 32830-1000 (% 407-828-8101; www.
disneyworld.com) to order a Walt Disney World Vacations brochure 
or DVD. You’ll find a dizzying menu of options from which to choose.
Although not on the same scale as Disney, the packages at Universal
Orlando have improved greatly since the addition of the Islands of
Adventure theme park (see Chapter 19), the CityWalk entertainment
district (see Chapters 10 and 25), and the Portofino Bay, Hard Rock,
and Royal Pacific hotels (see Chapter 9). Your package choices include
resort stays; VIP access to the parks, rides, and often restaurants; and
discounts to other non-Disney attractions. Universal also offers pack-
ages that include travel and transportation. Contact Universal Vacations
at % 877-801-9720, or surf online to www.universalorlando.com.
SeaWorld also offers packages that include rooms at a handful of
Orlando hotels including the Renaissance Orlando Resort at SeaWorld
(see Chapter 9), car rental, tickets to SeaWorld (see Chapter 20) and, 
in some cases, tickets to other theme parks. You can get information at
% 800-557-4268 or online at www.seaworldvacations.com.
Area hotels often join forces with the parks by offering special ticket
deals or stay-and-play packages, so be sure to ask when making your
hotel reservations. The World Center Marriott often offers SeaWorld
packages, and JW Marriott Orlando, Grande Lakes and Ritz-Carlton
Orlando, Grande Lakes (see Chapter 9) often offer holiday packages
featuring special meals, park tickets, and discounted rates.
Other places to find packages
You can also find packages elsewhere than the airlines and theme parks.
The United States Tour Operators Association’s Web site (www.ustoa.
com) has a search engine that enables you to look for operators that
offer packages to specific destinations.
Other package specialists include
 Touraine Travel (% 800-967-5583; www.tourainetravel.com)
offers a wide variety of tour packages to Disney and Disney proper-
ties, Universal Orlando, and SeaWorld.
 Golfpac Vacations (% 800-327-0878; www.golfpacinc.com) offers
a slate of play-and-stay packages — from basic to comprehensive.
Another option providing similar services is Golf Getaways 
(% 800-800-4028; www.golfgetaways.com).

orried that your kids are too young or that you’re too old to
enjoy Disney and beyond? Afraid you may experience barriers
blocking your access or lifestyle? In this chapter, I dispense a little
advice for travelers with specific needs.
Traveling with the Brood: Advice for Families
If you have enough trouble getting your kids out of the house in the
morning, dragging them thousands of miles away may seem like an
insurmountable challenge. But family travel can be immensely reward-
ing, letting you see the world through smaller pairs of wondrous and
curious eyes. Orlando loves kids and welcomes them like no other city
in the world. In addition to its theme parks, Orlando has plenty of
smaller kid-friendly attractions. All but a few restaurants offer lower-
priced children’s menus (see Chapter 10 for more info on kids and
dining), and most hotels love their younger guests, providing pint-size
pools and, in some cases, special gifts and programs. (See Chapter 9 for
kid-friendly hotels.)
Despite Orlando’s reputation as one of the kid-friendliest places around,
you may find some of its attractions a bit too edgy, sophisticated, or
intense for kids, including many of Epcot’s exhibits (see Chapter 13) and
many of the primo thrill rides at Islands of Adventure (see Chapter 19).
Likewise, you may find other attractions, such as Discovery Cove (see
Chapter 20), somewhat cost-prohibitive, even for adults.

Traveling with tots
Traveling with young children can often bring you more stress than
relaxation on your vacation. Consider that younger children have special
needs. They require frequent bathroom breaks and have very short
attention spans. (Does the question, “Are we there yet?” ring a bell?)
Here are a few general suggestions for making travel plans for you and
your youngsters:
 Consider age — are your kids old enough? Do you really want to
bring an infant or a toddler to an overcrowded, usually overheated
world that he or she may not be old enough to appreciate? The
large number of stroller-pushing, toddler-toting parents in the
parks suggests that many people think the experience isn’t too ter-
rible, but I’m warning you anyway. If your child or grandchild is 4
years old or younger, he or she may be able to appreciate only
some of the parks’ offerings, though a good deal of Disney’s Magic
Kingdom is geared to youngsters (see Chapter 12). However, some
of the costume-wearing characters may intimidate very young kids.
And no matter how organized you are, little ones are going to slow
you down. Ask yourself whether your kids are the right ages to
make the most out of a trip that costs the equivalent of a develop-
ing nation’s GNP.
 Find the right accommodations for the little ones. Kids younger
than 12 (and at times up to 17) can usually stay for free in their
parent’s room at most hotels. Look for places that have pools and
other recreational facilities so you have the option to spend a day
or two away from the parks without incurring too many additional
expenses. If you want to skip a rental car and you aren’t staying at
Disney, International Drive is the next-best place for centralized
rooms, restaurants, and attractions. The I-Drive trolley makes fre-
quent runs up and down the thoroughfare, hotels often offer family
discounts (see Chapter 9), and many provide free or moderate-cost
shuttles to Walt Disney World, SeaWorld, and Universal Orlando.
 Take advantage of sitter services. Most Orlando hotels, including
all of Disney’s, offer some form of baby-sitting services (usually
from an outside service) and several feature counselor-supervised
activity programs for children who’ve been toilet-trained. Baby-
sitting rates usually run $10 to $15 per hour for the first child, 
and often offer a discounted rate for additional children
 Plan ahead for character dining. If you’d like to eat a meal with a
cast of Disney characters while at Walt Disney World, make
Advanced Dining Reservations when you reserve your hotel room
(or even earlier as they book up quickly; see Chapter 10 for more
details about character dining). After you’re in WDW, check the
daily schedule for character meet-and-greets (all the major parks
post the information on their guide maps or on boards near the
park’s entrance) and make sure that the kids know when they’re
going to meet their heroes because doing so is often the highlight
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Walt Disney World and Orlando 
56

of their day. A little planning can help you avoid running after every
character you see, which only tires your little ones and gives you
sore feet. And remember — the “in” thing is getting character auto-
graphs, so take my advice: If price is no object, buy an autograph
book at the parks (it doubles as a good souvenir) — or buy one at
home and bring it along.
 Keep tabs on the little ones in the land of Mickey. Getting lost
inside a theme park is easy no matter what your age. For adults and
older kids, make sure that you arrange a lost-and-found meeting
place as soon as you arrive in the park. Attach a name tag to
younger kids (on the inside of their clothes) and find a park
employee as soon as you’ve been separated from your party. I list
lost-and-found locations in my descriptions of the major theme
parks in Chapters 12 to 16 and Chapters 18 to 20. Consider carrying
along a pair of two-way walkie-talkies or cellphones to help keep in
touch with everyone.
 Pack to toddler-proof your hotel room. Although your home may
be toddler-proof, hotel rooms aren’t. Bring outlet covers and other
necessary safety items to prevent an accident from occurring in
your room.
 Stay safe in the sun. Don’t forget to bring sunscreen for the entire
family. If you forget, buy sunscreen with a rating of SPF 30 or higher
before you go out in the sun. Slather your young children — even if
they’re in a stroller — and make sure that you pack a hat for infants
and toddlers. Likewise, make sure that everyone traveling with you
drinks plenty of water to avoid dehydration.
 Remember ride restrictions. Most parks explain their height
restrictions for certain attractions or identify those that may unset-
tle young children. (I also list these restrictions in my discussions
of the major theme parks in Chapters 12–16 and Chapters 18–20.)
Save yourself and your kids some grief before getting in line and
experiencing disappointment. Remember that a bad trip down a
darkened tunnel or a scary loop-de-loop can upset your youngster
for the rest of the day (sometimes longer).
 Take time out for a show. Catching an inside, air-conditioned show
two or three times a day provides a nice break for everyone, espe-
cially on hot and steamy summer afternoons. You may even get
your littlest tykes to nap in the darkened theater. Be sure to arrive
at least 20 minutes early if you want good seats, but not so early
that the kids go berserk waiting. (Most of the waiting areas are out-
side, even if the show is inside.)
 Pack a snack. When dreaming of your vacation, you probably don’t
envision hours spent waiting in lines. Unfortunately, doing so is
inevitable. Store some lightweight snacks in an easy-to-carry back-
pack, especially when traveling with small kids. You’ll save yourself
headaches and money.
Chapter 6: Catering to Special Travel Needs or Interests 57

 Bring your own stroller. Although you have to haul it to and from
the car and on and off trams, trains, and monorails at Disney,
having your own stroller can be a tremendous help. It’s with you
when you need it — say, back in the hotel room as a high chair, or
for an infant in a restaurant when a highchair is inappropriate. And
it’s an absolute lifesaver at Universal Studios Florida and Islands of
Adventure, where you face long walks from the parking lot to the
ticket booths. Your stroller should be lightweight, easy to fold and
unfold with one hand, have a canopy, be able to recline for naps,
and have plenty of storage space. The parks offer rental strollers
for between $8 and $18, but these are hard and uncomfortable.
They don’t recline and have little or no storage space for kid gear.
And they are absolutely inappropriate for infants and toddlers
(some parks rent infant-appropriate strollers but availability is
extremely limited). Park strollers will do, however, if you have older
kids who just need an occasional break from all the walking. For
infants and small toddlers, you may want to bring a Snugli-type
sling or backpack-type carrier for use in traveling to and from park-
ing lots and while you’re standing in line for attractions.
 Take a break. The Disney, Universal, and SeaWorld parks all feature
some rather unique play areas that offer parents a rest and the kids
a place to continue to have fun. Depending on your stamina, you
may want to schedule two or three visits to these spots a day.
 Bring a change of clothes. During summer months, the Florida
humidity can keep you feeling soggy all day, so bring fresh clothing
to change into, especially if you’re headed out for dinner afterward.
And you’ll really feel soggy if you take a spin on any of the parks’
water-related rides, so packing changes of clothes or even swim-
suits for the whole family is a good idea. Rent a locker ($5–$10) and
store your spare duds until you need them.
 Plan playtime for parents. Walt Disney World and Universal
Orlando offer a ride-share program for parents traveling with small
children. On many “big-kid” rides, one parent can ride the attrac-
tion while the other stays with the kids, and then the adults can
switch places and the second parent can ride without having to
stand in line again. Notify a staff member that you want to take
advantage of this program when you get in line.
Finding kid-friendly tours
Many theme parks design tours for the younger set that include great
sources of age-appropriate entertainment.
SeaWorld has justifiably earned its reputation as a park that makes edu-
cation fun with a variety of tours. One of the most interesting is the
Polar Expedition guided tour. This hour-long journey gives kids a
chance to come face to face with a penguin and get a behind-the-scenes
look at polar bears and beluga whales. Saving a Species, another hour-
long tour, allows you to see some of the park’s rescue and rehabilitation
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Walt Disney World and Orlando 
58

work with several species, including manatees and rare sea turtles. And
shark fans will enjoy the Predators tour. All tours are kid-friendly,
although the latter two may appeal more to older children. SeaWorld
tours are offered on a first-come, first-served basis, so reserve a place at
the guided tour information desk when you enter the park. They cost
$16 per adult, $12 ages 3 to 9, in addition to park admission ($62 adults,
$50 kids). Call % 800-406-2244 or go to www.seaworld.com for more
information.
At Walt Disney World, the Disney’s Family Magic Tour features an inter-
active scavenger hunt and costs $25 per person, plus park admission
($63 adults, $52 kids 3–9). Call % 407-939-8687 or go to www.disney
world.com for info.
Chapter 6: Catering to Special Travel Needs or Interests 59
More fun options for kids
Many of Disney’s resorts offer special options for the young set. Here’s just a sampling
of the best programs for kids:
 Disney’s Grand Floridian Resort offers a Pirate Cruise Adventure, where children
ages 4 to 10 depart from the Grand Floridian marina to visit exotic “ports of call”
to follow clues and collect “buried treasure.” Most kids will have a jolly good time.
It’s offered Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Saturday from 9:30 to 11:30 a.m.
and the $28 price tag includes lunch. Grand Adventures in Cooking invites up to
12 youngsters, 4 to 10 years old, to make dessert, paint an apron, and decorate a
chef hat ($28 per child, Tues and Fri 10–11:45 a.m.). The Wonderland Tea Party
gives kids a one-hour primer in cupcake decorating — with their fingers! They
also feast on heart-shaped PB&Js and sip apple juice “tea” while they listen 
to stories and play with Alice and the Mad Hatter ($28 per child, weekdays at 
1:30 p.m.).
 Disney’s Animal Kingdom Lodge features daily Junior Researcher (animal famil-
iarization) and Junior Chef (cookie decorating) enrichment programs that are free
for children staying at the lodge, as is the nightly African storytelling (among var-
ious other unique activities). Both programs are geared to potty-trained children
ages 4 to 10; if you’re interested, ask about them at check-in.
 At Disney’s Wilderness Lodge, you can take advantage of a special family option
that both kids and adults enjoy: the Flag Family program. If you’re selected, the
entire family can traipse up to the Wilderness Lodge’s roof in the morning (times
seem to vary, so ask) and raise the American flag that flies over the resort. You
get a picture, a certificate, and a fabulous view. If you’re interested, ask at the
front desk upon check-in.
For information on all of these programs, call % 407-827-4321 or surf the Net to
www.disneyworld.com for more information on all of Disney’s family offerings.

Making Age Work for You: Tips for Seniors
Although Orlando is kid and family oriented, many of its hotels, restau-
rants, and attractions also roll out the red carpet for older travelers,
especially those coming with grandkids. The theme parks don’t offer dis-
counted admission to seniors, but several attractions do, as does the
city’s public-transport system. You can find other discounts from several
sources listed in this section.
Members of AARP (formerly known as the American Association of
Retired Persons), 601 E St. NW, Washington, DC 20049 (% 888-687-2277
or 202-434-2277; www.aarp.org), get discounts on hotels, airfares, and
car rentals. AARP offers members a wide range of benefits, including
AARP: The Magazine and a monthly newsletter. Anyone over 50 can join.
Many reliable agencies and organizations target the 50-plus market.
Elderhostel (% 877-426-8056; www.elderhostel.org) arranges study
programs for those aged 55 and over (as well as for a spouse or compan-
ion of any age) in the United States and in more than 80 countries
around the world. Most courses last five to seven days in the United
States (two to four weeks abroad), and many include airfare, accommo-
dations in university dormitories or modest inns, meals, and tuition.
Several study programs, some specific to Walt Disney World, others
highlighting Orlando’s cultural offerings, are available throughout the
Orlando area.
Recommended publications offering travel resources and discounts for
seniors include: the quarterly magazine Travel 50 & Beyond (www.
travel50andbeyond.com); Travel Unlimited: Uncommon Adventures
for the Mature Traveler, by Alison Gardner (Avalon); 101 Tips for
Mature Travelers, available from Grand Circle Travel (% 800-221-2610

Accessing Orlando: Advice for 
Travelers with Disabilities
A disability need not prevent you from savoring the magic of Orlando
and Walt Disney World. Many of the city’s attractions and hotels are
designed to accommodate the needs of individuals with disabilities,
from specially equipped guest rooms to audio aids for the sight
impaired. A little advance research and planning, however, is a smart
idea.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Walt Disney World and Orlando 
60

Finding accommodating lodgings
Every hotel and motel in Florida is required by law to maintain a special
room (or rooms) equipped for wheelchairs, but keep in mind that the
law is being phased in over time, so some hotels may not yet have
rooms for those with disabilities. A few have wheel-in showers. Disney’s
Coronado Springs Resort (% 407-934-1000), which opened in 1997,
maintains 99 rooms that are designed to accommodate guests with dis-
abilities, so make your special needs known when making reservations.
For other information about special Disney rooms, call % 407-939-7807.
If you don’t mind staying 15 minutes from Disney, Yvonne’s Properties
(% 877-714-1144 or 863-424-0795; www.villasinorlando.com) is a
rental agency for, among other things, some handicapped-accessible
homes that have multiple bedrooms, multiple baths (including accessi-
ble showers), full kitchens, and pools outfitted with lifts. Most cost less
than $200 a night and are located in Davenport.
Getting around
Public buses in Orlando have hydraulic lifts and restraining belts for
wheelchairs, and they serve Universal Orlando, SeaWorld, shopping
areas, and downtown Orlando. When staying on Disney property, you
can use shuttle buses that accommodate wheelchairs.
If you need to rent a wheelchair or an electric scooter for your visit,
Walker Medical & Mobility Products (% 888-726-6837 or 407-518-6000;
www.walkermobility.com) will deliver one to your room; it offers a
model that accommodates guests weighing up to 375 pounds; it fits into
Disney’s transports and monorails and into rental cars. You can also rent
conventional and electric chairs daily at the theme parks (see Chapters
12–16 and Chapters 18–20).
Many of the major car-rental companies now offer hand-controlled cars
for drivers with disabilities. See the Quick Concierge in the back of the
book for the major rental companies’ toll-free numbers and Web sites.
Avis Rent A Car has an Avis Access program that offers such services as
a dedicated 24-hour toll-free number (% 888-879-4273) for customers
with special travel needs; special car features such as swivel seats, spin-
ner knobs, and hand controls; and accessible bus service.
Amtrak (% 800-872-7245; www.amtrak.com) can provide you with
redcap service, wheelchair assistance, and special seats if you give 72-
hour notice. Travelers with disabilities also are entitled to a 15 percent
discount off the lowest available adult coach fare. You’re required to
show documentation from a doctor or an ID card proving your disability,
however. Amtrak also provides wheelchair-accessible sleeping accom-
modations on its long-distance trains. Amtrak permits service dogs
aboard, and they travel free. TTY service also is available at % 800-
523-6590 or by writing to P.O. Box 7717, Itasca, IL 60143.
Chapter 6: Catering to Special Travel Needs or Interests 61

Greyhound (% 800-752-4841; www.greyhound.com) allows a physically
challenged passenger to travel with a companion for a single fare. When
you call 48 hours in advance, the bus line also arranges assistance along
the route of your trip. It also permits service dogs aboard.
Maneuvering through theme parks
All the parks offer parking as close as possible to the entrance for
people with disabilities. Tell the parking attendant about your special
needs, and he or she can direct you to the appropriate spot.
Each park’s guide map tells you what to expect when you arrive. Most
theme-park rides and shows, especially the newer ones, are designed to
be accessible to a wide variety of guests. Likewise, theme parks often
give people in wheelchairs (and their parties) preferential treatment so
that they can avoid long lines. If you use crutches or suffer from some
other medical problem that may restrict your mobility in any way, you’re
probably better off renting a wheelchair; the amount of walking you
need to do in the parks may wear you down quickly. You can rent wheel-
chairs at most major Orlando attractions, but you’ll probably be more
comfortable in your chair from home (and it will save some money, too).
Keep in mind, however, that wheelchairs wider than 241⁄2 inches may
make navigating through some attractions difficult. And crowds can
make getting around tough for any guest.
Walt Disney World
The Magic Mickster offers a Guidebook for Guests with Disabilities that
details many services. Disney no longer mails them prior to visits, but
you can pick one up at Guest Relations near the entrances of the four
parks; they’re also available at some resorts. You can also call % 407-
824-4321 or 407-824-2222 for answers to questions about special needs.
For accessibility issues relating to the WDW resorts, call % 407-939-
7807. A special link at the bottom of Disney’s Web site at www.disney
world.com leads to a host of information for those with disabilities.
Examples of Disney services include the following:
 Almost all Disney resort hotels have rooms for people with 
disabilities.
 You can find Braille directories inside the Magic Kingdom in front of
City Hall, and at Guest Relations in the other parks (a $25 refund-
able deposit is required). You can pick up complimentary guided-
tour audiocassette tapes and recorders (a $25 refundable deposit is
required) at Guest Relations to assist visually impaired guests.
 Assisted-listening devices are available to amplify the audio at
selected attractions at WDW parks. At some attractions, guests also
can get handheld wireless receivers that display captions about
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Walt Disney World and Orlando 
62

those attractions. (Both services are free but require a $25 refund-
able deposit). Inquire at Guest Relations inside each park.
 Sign translation is available for most of Disney’s live shows on a
rotating schedule: Mondays and Thursdays at the Magic Kingdom,
Tuesdays and Fridays at Epcot, Sundays and Wednesdays at
Disney–MGM Studios, and Saturdays at Disney’s Animal Kingdom.
Guests who want sign translation should call Disney at % 407-824-
4321 (voice) or 407-827-5141 (TTY) at least two weeks in advance.
 Several attractions inside the major parks offer special closed-cap-
tioned LED screens for the hearing-impaired. Inquire at Guest
Relations inside each park for the list of attractions currently offer-
ing this option.
 Service animals are allowed in all parks and on some rides.
Universal Orlando
If you’re physically challenged, go to Guest Services, located just inside
the main entrances of Universal Studios Florida and Islands of Adventure,
to get a Riders Guide, a TTY, or other special assistance. You can rent
wheelchairs from the concourse area of the parking garage and just
inside each park. Wheelchairs can navigate the entry lines at all attrac-
tions with the exception of Back to the Future The Ride, which has a spe-
cial access entrance. Universal also provides audio descriptions on
cassette for visually impaired guests and has sign-language guides 
and scripts for its shows. (Advance notice is required; call % 800-837-
2273 or 407-363-8000 or check each park’s Web site at www.universal
orlando.com for details.) Sign-language–interpreting services are avail-
able at Universal Studios Florida or Islands of Adventure, at no charge.
Arrangements for an appointment with an interpreter should be made
one to two weeks in advance by contacting the Sign Language Services
Department at % 888-519-4899 (toll-free TTY), 407-224-4414 (local
TTY), or 407-224-5929 (voice).
SeaWorld
SeaWorld provides a guide booklet for guests with disabilities, although
most of its attractions are accessible to people in wheelchairs. You can
pick one up at Guest Services inside the park or download it at www.
seaworldorlando.com. SeaWorld also provides a Braille guide for the
visually impaired and a very brief synopsis of its shows for the hearing
impaired. Sign-language–interpreting services are available at no charge,
but must be reserved by calling % 407-363-2414 at least a week in
advance of your visit. Assisted-listening devices are available at select
attractions for a $20 refundable deposit. For a complete rundown on all
your options, head to Guest Services when you enter the park; you can
also call % 407-351-3600 for more information.

Advice for Gay and Lesbian Travelers
The popularity of Orlando as a destination for gay and lesbian travelers
is apparent in the development of the Gay Day Celebration at Disney
World into Gay Days weekend festivities. Gay- and lesbian-related events
also take place at Universal and SeaWorld. These festivals are scheduled
the first weekend in June and draw tens of thousands of gay and lesbian
travelers to Central Florida. Find information at www.gayday.com or
www.gaydays.com.
You also can get information about events for Gay Days and for events
that occur throughout the year from Gay, Lesbian & Bisexual
Community Center of Central Florida, 946 N. Mills Ave., Orlando, FL
32803 (% 407-228-8272; www.glbcc.org). Welcome packets usually
include the latest issue of Triangle, dedicated to gay and lesbian issues,
a calendar of events pertaining to Florida’s gay and lesbian community,
and information and ads for the area’s clubs. Gay Orlando Network
(www.gayorlando.com) is another good resource.
The entertainment industry and theme parks have helped build a strong
gay and lesbian community in Orlando. Same-sex dancing is acceptable
at most clubs at WDW’s Pleasure Island, especially the large and very
popular Mannequins Dance Palace. Many of Universal’s CityWalk
establishments are similarly gender blind. The tenor of crowds can
change, however, depending on what tour is in town, so respect your
own intuition.
If you’re interested in sampling some of the other local gay and lesbian
hot spots, check out the following places:
 The Club at Firestone, 578 N. Orange Ave. at Concord Street, in a
converted garage that still bears the Firestone sign (% 407-426-
0005; www.clubatfirestone.com): Go-go boys dance on lifts con-
verted into raised platforms, and a diverse group boogies on the
large concrete floor. This is a serious dance club, with dark lighting,
cavernous rooms, and a high-energy atmosphere, which also some-
times features well-known DJs. Saturdays are the best day to visit
for a heavy gay-centric crowd. It’s open daily from 9 p.m. to 2 a.m.
The cover charge varies from $5 to $10. Limited lot parking is avail-
able for $3 to $5.
 Parliament House, 410 N. Orange Blossom Trail just west of down-
town (% 407-425-7571; www.parliamenthouse.com): This resort
is one of Orlando’s wilder, and most popular, gay spots, although
it’s not particularly fancy and not in the best neighborhood in
town. It is, however, a popular place to drink, dance, and watch
shows that include female impersonators and male revues. The
Parliament House has six bars and clubs. Its disco opens daily at 
9 p.m., except on Sunday when things start up at 3 p.m.; showtimes
vary. Cover charges vary but usually don’t rise above $10.

 Southern Nights, 375 S. Bumby Ave. between Anderson Street and
Colonial Drive (% 407-898-0424; www.southern-nights.com):
Voted “Best Gay Bar” by readers of a local alternative weekly paper,
Southern Nights offers theme nights throughout the week, from
Latin Night to College Night to Drag Night. Recent renovations
include the addition of Rendezvous, a separate happy-hour club.
Southern Nights opens at 10 p.m. Monday through Saturday;
Rendezvous opens at 5 p.m. Closing hours vary according to event.
Cover charges vary but usually don’t rise above $10. Self-parking in
the club lot is free, and valet parking costs $5.
The International Gay and Lesbian Travel Association (IGLTA) (% 800-
448-8550 or 954-776-2626; www.iglta.org) is the trade association for
the gay and lesbian travel industry and offers an online directory of 
gay- and lesbian-friendly travel businesses; go to its Web site and click
on “Members.”
Many agencies offer tours and travel itineraries specific to gay and 
lesbian travelers. Above and Beyond Tours (% 800-397-2681; www.
abovebeyondtours.com) is the exclusive gay and lesbian tour operator
for United Airlines. Now, Voyager (% 800-255-6951; www.nowvoyager.
com) is a well-known San Francisco–based gay-owned and -operated
travel service. Olivia Cruises and Resorts (% 800-631-6277 or
510-655-0364; www.olivia.com) charters entire resorts and ships for
exclusive lesbian vacations and offers smaller group experiences for
both gay and lesbian travelers.
The following travel guides are available at most travel bookstores and
gay and lesbian bookstores, or you can order them from Giovanni’s
Room, 1145 Pine St., Philadelphia, PA 19107 (% 215-923-2960; www.

Remaining Details
In This Chapter
 Sorting out your rental-car options
 Buying travel and medical insurance
 Dealing with illness away from home
 Staying in touch using the Web and cellphones
 Getting through airport security
You’re almost ready to leave for Orlando. All you need to do is take
care of a few last-minute details, plan an itinerary, put the dog in the
kennel, stuff your bags with everything that’s clean, water the gerani-
ums, pay the mortgage, and finish 50 other eleventh-hour musts.
The information in this chapter gives you planning tips and saves you
from wasting precious vacation hours after you’re in Magic Mickeyville.
You can discover whether it’s worth your while to rent a car, get advice
about buying travel insurance, check out your options if you get sick on
your trip, find out how to keep in touch with your relatives back home,
and figure out how to navigate your way through today’s airline security
procedures.
Renting a Car — Or Not
First off, you have to decide whether you need a rental car for your
Orlando vacation. If you’re going to spend most of your time at a resort,
especially Walt Disney World, you may not need a car. Disney has its
own free transportation system; buses, ferries, trams, and monorails run
throughout the property, connecting all its resorts, parks, and entertain-
ment venues. (See Chapter 8 for more information about the Disney
transportation system.)

The Disney system does have some notable drawbacks: You’re a pris-
oner of WDW’s often slow and indirect schedule. Depending on your
starting point and your destination, it can take up to an hour to get
where you’re going. During peak hours in the busiest seasons, you may
have trouble getting a seat on the bus, so keep that in mind if you’re
traveling with kids, seniors, or companions with disabilities. Also, if
you’re bringing along children and strollers, consider the frustration
factor of loading strollers and all their paraphernalia on and off buses,
ferries, and trams.
If you plan to spend most of your time at Universal Orlando and stay at
one of its resorts, a rental car may also be unnecessary. All of Universal’s
resorts offer boat transportation to its theme parks and CityWalk (see
Chapters 18 and 19 for more on Universal’s theme parks).
If you won’t be spending all your time solely at either WDW or Universal,
and you want to visit SeaWorld and other attractions or areas of Central
Florida, you need to either rent a car or choose an alternate form of
transportation, such as a hotel shuttle (some are free; others charge an
average of $8–$16 per person). Mears Transportation (% 407-423-5566;
www.mearstransportation.com), a popular local shuttle service, and
taxis (though horridly expensive) are other options. (See Chapter 8 for
more information on transportation options in Orlando, including the I-
Ride Trolley.) Getting several people to the parks on a daily basis can be
expensive if you choose these routes, but you can save on car-rental
fees, gas, and the $9- or $10-per-day parking fees at the major attractions
if you take advantage of Orlando’s transit system. You need to decide
whether the added convenience and mobility of a rental car is worth the
extra expense; if you plan to be in Orlando only for a short while or are
traveling with kids, I definitely recommend you shell out for the car in
order to maximize your vacation mobility.
WDW has an Alamo car-rental desk (% 800-327-2996) right on property,
so if you’re interested in renting only for a day or two instead of for your
entire vacation, this may be a good option (though be aware that rental
prices are generally higher if you rent anywhere other than the airport).
Getting a good rate
Car-rental rates vary even more than airline fares. The price depends on
the size of the car, the length of time you keep it, where and when you
pick it up and drop it off, where you take it, and a host of other factors.
Doing a little research may save you hundreds of dollars. Here are some
tips to get you started:
 Ask whether the rate is the same for pickup Friday morning as it
is for Thursday night. Weekend rates may be lower than weekday
rates. If you’re keeping the car five or more days, a weekly rate may
be cheaper than the daily rate.
Chapter 7: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 67

 Find out whether the company you’re renting from assesses a
drop-off charge if you don’t return the car to the same rental
location. Some do, some don’t. National is one of the companies
that doesn’t charge in this situation.
 Check whether the rate is cheaper if you pick up the car at a loca-
tion in town rather than at the airport.
 Find out whether age is an issue. For drivers under 25, many car-
rental companies add on a fee, and some don’t rent to them at all.
Under-age rental fees are common in Orlando and can add as much
as $15 a day to your total rate.
 If you see an advertised price in your local newspaper, be sure to
ask for that specific rate; otherwise you may be charged the stan-
dard (higher) rate. Don’t forget to mention membership in AAA,
AARP, and trade unions. These memberships usually entitle you to
discounts ranging from 5 to 30 percent.
 Check your frequent-flier accounts. Not only are your favorite 
(or at least most-used) airlines likely to have sent you discount
coupons, but most car rentals add at least 500 miles to your
account.
 Comparison-shop on the Internet. As with other aspects of plan-
ning your trip, the Web can make comparison shopping for a car
rental much easier. You can check rates at most of the major agen-
cies’ Web sites. Plus, all the major travel sites — Travelocity
(www.travelocity.com), Expedia (www.expedia.com), Orbitz
(www.orbitz.com), and Smarter Travel (www.smartertravel.
com), for example — have search engines that can dig up dis-
counted car-rental rates.
Most car-rental companies charge on a 24-hour basis. That means if you
pick up the car at 3 p.m., you need to return it by 3 p.m. on the specified
end date of your rental. Often, if your flight arrival and departure times
in Orlando are far apart (say you arrive at 10 a.m. and don’t fly out 
until 8 p.m.), you need to rent the car for a day longer than your stay.
However, if the inbound and outbound flight times are within an hour or
two of each other, inquire about hourly rates — they may be less than
the cost of another full day. If you want information about specific rental-
car companies serving Orlando, see the Quick Concierge in the back of
this book.
Adding up extra rental costs
In addition to the standard rental prices, other optional charges apply to
most car rentals (and some not-so-optional charges, such as taxes). The
Collision Damage Waiver (CDW), which requires you to pay for damage
to the car in a collision, is covered by many credit-card companies.
Check with your credit-card company before you go so you can avoid
paying this hefty fee (as much as $20 a day or more).
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Walt Disney World and Orlando 
68

The car-rental companies also offer additional liability insurance (if you
harm others in an accident), personal-accident insurance (if you harm
yourself or your passengers), and personal-effects insurance (if your
luggage is stolen from your car). Your insurance policy on your car at
home probably covers most of these unlikely occurrences. However, if
your own insurance doesn’t cover you for rentals or if you don’t have
auto insurance, definitely consider the additional coverage (ask your
car-rental agent for more information). Unless you’re toting around the
Hope diamond, and you don’t want to leave that in your car trunk
anyway, you can probably skip the personal-effects insurance, but driv-
ing around without liability or personal-accident coverage is never a
good idea. Even if you’re a good driver, other people may not be, and lia-
bility claims can be complicated.
Some companies also offer refueling packages, in which you pay for
your initial full tank of gas up front and can return the car with an empty
gas tank. The prices can be competitive with local gas prices, but you
don’t get credit for any gas remaining in the tank. If you reject this
option, you pay only for the gas you use, but you have to return the car
with a full tank or face hefty per-gallon refueling charges for any short-
fall. If you usually run late and a fueling stop may make you miss your
plane, you’re a perfect candidate for the fuel-purchase option.
Playing It Safe with Travel 
and Medical Insurance
Three kinds of travel insurance are available: trip-cancellation insurance,
medical insurance, and lost-luggage insurance. The cost of travel insur-
ance varies widely, depending on the cost and length of your trip, your
age and health, and the type of trip you’re taking, but expect to pay
between 5 and 8 percent of the vacation itself. Here is my advice on all
three:
 Trip-cancellation insurance helps you get your money back if you
have to back out of a trip, if you have to go home early, or if your
travel supplier goes bankrupt. Allowed reasons for cancellation can
range from sickness to natural disasters to the State Department
declaring your destination unsafe for travel. (Insurers usually won’t
cover vague fears, though, as many travelers discovered who tried
to cancel their trips in Oct 2001 because they were wary of flying.)
A good resource is Travel Guard Alerts, a posted list of companies
considered high-risk by Travel Guard International (www.travel
insured.com). Protect yourself further by paying for the insurance
with a credit card — by law, consumers can get their money back
on goods and services not received if they report the loss within 
60 days after the charge is listed on their credit-card statement.
Chapter 7: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 69

Note: Many tour operators, particularly those offering trips to
remote or high-risk areas, include insurance in the cost of the trip
or can arrange insurance policies through a partnering provider, a
convenient and often cost-effective way for the traveler to obtain
insurance. Make sure the tour company is a reputable one, how-
ever, and avoid buying insurance from the tour or cruise company
you’re traveling with so you don’t put all your money in one place.
 For domestic travel, buying medical insurance for your trip 
doesn’t make sense for most travelers. Most existing health poli-
cies cover you if you get sick away from home — but check before
you go, particularly if you’re insured by an HMO.
 Lost-luggage insurance isn’t necessary for most travelers. On
domestic flights, checked baggage is covered up to $2,500 per tick-
eted passenger. On international flights (including U.S. portions of
international trips), baggage coverage is limited to approximately
$9 per pound, up to $635 per checked bag. If you plan to check
items more valuable than the standard liability, see whether your
valuables are covered by your homeowner’s policy, get baggage
insurance as part of your comprehensive travel-insurance package,
or buy Travel Guard’s BagTrak product. Don’t buy the overpriced
insurance at the airport. Be sure to take any valuables or irreplace-
able items with you in your carry-on luggage because many valu-
ables (including books, money, and electronics) aren’t covered by
airline policies.
If your luggage is lost, immediately file a lost-luggage claim at the
airport, detailing the luggage contents. For most airlines, you must
report delayed, damaged, or lost baggage within four hours of
arrival. The airlines are required to deliver luggage, once found,
directly to your house or destination free of charge.
For more information, contact one of the following recommended insur-
ers: Access America (% 866-807-3982; www.accessamerica.com),
Travel Guard International (% 800-826-4919; www.travelguard.com),
Travel Insured International (% 800-243-3174; www.travelinsured.
com), or Travelex Insurance Services (% 888-457-4602; www.travelex-
insurance.com).
Staying Healthy when You Travel
Getting sick can ruin your vacation, so I strongly advise against it. (Of
course, last time I checked, the bugs weren’t listening to me any more
than they probably listen to you.)
If you have a serious or chronic illness, talk to your doctor before leav-
ing on a trip. For conditions such as epilepsy, diabetes, or heart prob-
lems, wear a MedicAlert identification tag (% 888-633-4298; www.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Walt Disney World and Orlando 
70

medicalert.org), which immediately alerts doctors to your condition
and gives them access to your records through MedicAlert’s 24-hour 
hot line.
Preventing the easily preventable
The biggest health obstacle you’ll encounter in Orlando will be the
strong Florida sun. Limit your exposure, especially during the first few
days of your trip and, thereafter, during the hours of 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.,
when the sun is at its strongest. Use a sunscreen with at least a sun pro-
tection factor (SPF) of 30 (especially for children) and apply it liberally
and often. If you have children under a year old, check with your pedia-
trician before applying a sunscreen — some ingredients may not be
appropriate for infants. A hat and sunglasses are de rigueur fashion in
Florida for a reason and keep you from suffering sun glare or a painful
sunburn.
Dehydration is another potential issue when touring Orlando. Be sure to
drink plenty of fluids and see that any children traveling with you do so
as well. Note that soft drinks loaded with caffeine, a diuretic, can cause
or make dehydration worse, so stick to water or decaffeinated drinks.
Finally, the bane of many a theme-park walker who hasn’t hoofed it any-
where lately are blisters. If you have problematic feet, bring comfortable
walking shoes and lots of socks, and buy some protective moleskin. A
change of socks midday may keep you from hobbling by nightfall.
Knowing what to do if you get sick
All the major theme parks have first-aid stations; ask a park employee or
consult your park map for its location. Disney offers in-room medical
service at its resorts 24 hours a day — call % 407-238-2000. If you’re
staying off Disney property, Doctors on Call Service (% 407-399-3627)
is a group that makes house and room calls in most of the Orlando area.
To find a dentist, call Dental Referral Service (% 800-235-4111; www.
dentalreferral.com). They can refer you to the nearest dentist who
meets your needs. Phones are staffed weekdays from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.
If your ailment isn’t a life-threatening emergency, use a walk-in clinic in
Orlando. You may not get immediate attention, but you’ll probably pay
around $75 rather than the $300 minimum for just signing in at an emer-
gency-room counter. Centra-Care (www.centracare.org) has several
walk-in clinics listed in the Yellow Pages, including ones on Vineland
Road near Universal (% 407-351-6682) and at Lake Buena Vista near
Disney (% 407-934-2273) among others. After Hours Pediatrics, two
facilities near the tourist districts, are located at the Crossroads
Shopping Center in lake Buena Vista (% 407-827-7113) and on Dr.
Phillips Boulevard near Universal Orlando (% 407-363-5753). They spe-
cialize in urgent care for kids (through age 21) and are open until 11 p.m.
every night.
Chapter 7: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 71

You can fill your prescriptions at dozens of pharmacies listed in the
Yellow Pages. Walgreens operates a 24-hour pharmacy at 12100 S.
Apopka Vineland Rd. (% 407-238-0400; www.walgreens.com), in addi-
tion to several other 24-hour locations throughout the area; check the
company’s Web site for details.
Staying Connected by Cellphone or E-mail
Want to tell the folks back home that you arrived safe and sound? Or
e-mail them that digital snapshot of your meeting with Mickey? It’s
easier than ever to stay in touch with your friends, family, even the
office (unlucky for you), while you’re on the road.
Using a cellphone across the United States
Just because your cellphone works at home doesn’t mean it’ll work else-
where in the country (thanks to the nation’s fragmented cellphone
system). It’s a good bet that your phone will work in Orlando, however.
But take a look at your wireless company’s coverage map on its Web site
before heading out — T-Mobile, Sprint, and Nextel are particularly weak
in rural areas. If your wireless company doesn’t have good coverage in
the Orlando area, rent a phone that does from InTouch USA (% 800-
872-7626; www.intouchglobal.com) or a rental-car location, but
beware that you’ll pay $1 a minute or more for airtime.
If you’re not from the United States, you’ll be appalled at the poor reach
of our GSM (Global System for Mobiles) wireless network, which is used
by much of the rest of the world. Your phone will probably work in most
major U.S. cities; it definitely won’t work in many rural areas. (To see
where GSM phones work in the United States, check out www.t-mobile.
com/coverage/national_popup.asp.) And you may or may not be
able to send SMS (text messaging) home. Assume nothing — call your
wireless provider and get the full scoop. In a worst-case scenario, you
can always rent a phone; InTouch USA delivers to hotels.
Accessing the Internet away from home
Travelers have any number of ways to check their e-mail and access the
Internet on the road. Of course, using your own laptop — or even a per-
sonal digital assistant (PDA) or electronic organizer with a modem —
gives you the most flexibility.
But even if you don’t have a computer, you can still access your e-mail
and even your office computer from cybercafes. It’s hard nowadays to
find a city that doesn’t have a few cybercafes. Although there’s no defini-
tive directory for cybercafes — these are independent businesses, after
all — two places to start looking are at www.cybercaptive.com and
www.cybercafe.com.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Walt Disney World and Orlando 
72

Inside Walt Disney World, you can find an Internet cafe inside
DisneyQuest, and you can also send e-mail at Innoventions: The Road
to Tomorrow in Epcot, though you have to pay the park admission fees
to use the Web terminals. Pay phones with touch-screen displays offer-
ing Internet access have been installed at locations throughout Walt
Disney World; you can access your e-mail for 25¢ a minute with a four-
minute minimum.
Aside from formal cybercafes, most public libraries offer Internet access
free or for a small charge. Avoid hotel business centers unless you’re
willing to pay exorbitant rates.
Most major airports now have Internet kiosks scattered throughout
their gates. These kiosks, which you’ll also see in shopping malls, hotel
lobbies, and tourist information offices, give you basic Web access for 
a per-minute fee that’s usually higher than cybercafe prices. The kiosks’
clunkiness and high price mean they should be avoided whenever 
possible.
If you are bringing your own computer, the buzzword in computer
access is Wi-Fi (short for wireless fidelity), where you can get high-speed
connection without cable wires, networking hardware, or a phone line.
More and more hotels, cafes, and retailers are signing on as wireless
“hotspots.” You sign up for wireless-access service much as you do cell-
phone service, through a plan offered by one of several commercial
companies that have made wireless service available in airports, hotel
lobbies, and coffee shops. T-Mobile Hotspot (www.t-mobile.com/
hotspot) serves up wireless connections at more than 1,000 Starbucks
coffee shops nationwide. Boingo (www.boingo.com) and Wayport
(www.wayport.com) have set up networks in airports and high-class
hotel lobbies. Best of all, you don’t need to be staying at the Four
Seasons to use the hotel’s network; just set yourself up on a nice couch
in the lobby. The companies’ pricing policies can be Byzantine, with a
variety of monthly, per-connection, and per-minute plans, but, in gen-
eral, you pay around $30 a month for limited access — and as more and
more companies jump on the wireless bandwagon, prices are likely to
get even more competitive.
You can also find a few free wireless networks. To locate these free
hotspots, go to www.personaltelco.net/index.cgi/Wireless
Communities.
WDW offers high-speed Internet connections to guests at all of its
resorts with limited Wi-Fi access at select resorts. All Universal Orlando
resorts offer high-speed Internet access. Most business and higher-end
hotels in Orlando offer at least an in-room dataport, and several offer
Internet connections. You can bring your own cables, but most hotels
rent them for around $10 (others at no charge). Call your hotel in
advance to see what your options are.
Chapter 7: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 73

In addition, major ISPs have local access numbers in Orlando, allowing
you to go online by simply placing a local call. Check your ISP’s Web site
or call its toll-free number and ask how you can use your current
account away from home and how much it will cost.
Keeping Up with Airline Security
With the federalization of airport security, security procedures at U.S.
airports are more consistent than ever. Generally, you’ll be fine if you
arrive at the airport one hour before a domestic flight and two hours
before an international flight; if you show up late, tell an airline
employee and he or she will probably whisk you to the front of the line.
Bring a current, government-issued photo ID such as a driver’s license
or passport. Keep your ID at the ready to show at check-in, the security
checkpoint, and sometimes even the gate. (Children under 18 don’t need
government-issued photo IDs for domestic flights, but they do for inter-
national flights to most countries.)
In 2003, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) phased out
gate check-in at all U.S. airports. And E-tickets have made paper tickets
nearly obsolete. If you have an E-ticket, you can beat the ticket-counter
lines by using airport electronic kiosks or even online check-in from
your home computer. To check in online, log on to your airline’s Web
site, access your reservation, and print out your boarding pass — the
airline may even offer you bonus miles to do so! If you’re using a kiosk at
the airport, bring the credit card you used to book the ticket, your fre-
quent-flier card, or your confirmation number. Print out your boarding
pass from the kiosk and simply proceed to the security checkpoint with
your pass and a photo ID. If you’re checking bags or looking to snag an
exit-row seat, you can do so using most airline kiosks. Even the smaller
airlines are employing the kiosk system, but always call your airline to
make sure these alternatives are available. Curbside check-in is also a
good way to avoid lines, although a few airlines still ban curbside check-
in; call before you go.
Security checkpoint lines can be long, particularly if there has been a
recent terrorist scare. If you have trouble standing for long periods of
time, tell an airline employee; the airline will provide a wheelchair. Speed
up security by not wearing metal objects such as big belt buckles. If
you’ve got metallic body parts, a note from your doctor can prevent a
long chat with the security screeners. Keep in mind that only ticketed
passengers are allowed past security, except for folks escorting passen-
gers with disabilities or unaccompanied children.

74

Travelers in the United States are allowed one carry-on bag, plus a per-
sonal item such as a purse, briefcase, or laptop bag. You can stuff all
sorts of things into a laptop bag; as long as it has a laptop in it, it’s still
considered a personal item. The TSA has issued a list of restricted items;
check its Web site (www.tsa.gov/public/index.jsp) for details.
Airport screeners may decide that your checked luggage needs to be
searched by hand. You can now purchase luggage locks that allow
screeners to open and relock a checked bag if hand-searching is neces-
sary. Look for Travel Sentry certified locks at luggage or travel shops
and Brookstone stores (you can buy them online at www.brookstone.
com). These locks, approved by the TSA, can be opened by luggage
inspectors with a special code or key. For more information on the locks,
visit www.travelsentry.org. If you use something other than TSA-
approved locks, your lock will be cut off your suitcase if a TSA agent
needs to hand-search your luggage.

Settling into Orlando

In this part . . . 
O
rlando isn’t New York or London, but it can seem just as
overwhelming at ﬁrst. Getting around the tourist areas
and downtown Orlando can be a little intimidating. Don’t
worry, though — it isn’t as complicated as it looks. In this
part, I walk you through the city’s neighborhoods, tell you
where to catch local transportation, and erase any confusion
you may have.
After you’ve got your bearings, I review the city’s best hotels
so you can zero in on a room that’s right for you. Then I detail
Orlando’s A-list eateries and give you lists of the city’s best
restaurants by price, location, and cuisine. And for dessert,
you get a thorough rundown of that most quintessential of
Orlando experiences — character meals.

A
ll roads in Orlando don’t lead to Disney, although the reverse may
seem true to first-time visitors. Yes, you’d be hard-pressed to drive
along a street or highway without coming across a sign directing you to
Walt Disney World, but this abundance of directions doesn’t mean that
you won’t find other signs pointing you to the rest of the city’s high-
lights. In this chapter, you take the first step, getting from the airport 
to the parks, and you gain some insight about Orlando’s “other” major
neighborhoods.
Arriving in Orlando
Unlike many tourist-oriented cities, Orlando’s airports do not lie in the
heart of the city’s action. But fear not — both of the city’s airports are
relatively user-friendly, and getting to the any one of the theme parks is
a generally hassle-free experience.
Navigating the airport
Although some of your fellow travelers (in particular, those unfortunate
souls who didn’t read this book) are aimlessly meandering through the
hallways of the Orlando International Airport (% 407-825-2001; www.
orlandoairports.net), you’ll zippity-do-dah to baggage claim and into
your chariot of choice. Though the airport itself is generally easy to nav-
igate, it’s usually quite busy, there are plenty of distractions, and it can
take you a while to get from point A to point B.

Follow the signs carefully to get from the terminal you land in to baggage
claim. (You may need to take the tram to the main terminal and then go
to Level 2 for your bags.) Note: If you’re arriving from a foreign country,
you have to go through Immigration before baggage claim and then
through Customs after picking up your luggage.
If you need cash, ATMs are located in the arrival and departure termi-
nals near the four pods of gates (1–29, 30–59, 60–99, and 100–129). ATMs
also are located where the shuttles deposit you in the main terminal as
well as along the North and South walkways and the West Hall. If you
need to convert your pounds, euros, and so on to U.S. dollars, you can
find currency exchanges (open 9:30 a.m.–7 p.m.) in the 100–129 pod of
gates and along the South walkway in the main terminal (near the food
court).
Most major car-rental companies are located at the airport (on Level 1)
with others located a mile or so down the road. Keep in mind that if the
company you choose is at a nearby location instead of right on-site, you’ll
need to take the shuttle to pick up your car. (See the Quick Concierge for
the toll-free numbers of the major rental companies.) You can catch hotel
shuttles or taxis on the ground level of the main terminal.
If you’re arriving on one of the newer regional or international budget
airlines that serves Orlando Sanford Airport (% 407-585-4000; www.
orlandosanfordairport.com), you’ll appreciate the smaller airport
layout. Baggage claim is downstairs, ATMs are found in the gate areas,
and most of the car-rental companies have locations right at the airport.
Finding your way to your hotel
The Orlando International Airport is a 25- to 40-minute hop, skip, and
long jump from Walt Disney World, depending on traffic, and 15 to 25
minutes from Universal Orlando and downtown. Mears Transportation
Group (% 407-423-5566; www.mearstransportation.com) is the major
shuttle player. It runs vans between the airport (you board at ground
level) and all Disney resorts and official hotels, and most other area
properties, every 15 to 25 minutes. Round-trip to downtown Orlando 
or International Drive is $25 for adults ($18 for kids 4–11); it’s $29 for
adults ($21 for kids) to Walt Disney World/Lake Buena Vista or
Kissimmee/U.S. 192.
Quicksilver Tours and Transportation (% 407-299-1434; www.
quicksilver-tours.com) is more personal. You’re greeted at baggage
claim with a sign bearing your name. The cost is more than Mears, but
it’s coming for you, not other travelers, too — and it’s going only to your
resort. Included is an array of services, including a quick stop for gro-
ceries. Rates run $95 (up to four, round-trip) to I-Drive/Universal
Orlando and $100 to Disney. If you have a larger group (five or more,
round-trip) and require a van, the rates run $110 to Universal and I-Drive
Part III: Settling into Orlando 
80

and $115 to Disney. Selective Limousine (% 888-784-2522 or 407-354-
2456; www.selectivelimo.com) is another company that offers a very
high level of service. For $210, you get round-trip stretch-limo service
from the airport to your hotel for up to eight people; the price includes a
free stop at a supermarket for food supplies, safety seats for any chil-
dren in your party, and a complimentary stuffed Mickey Mouse for the
kids. Cheaper shuttle rates are also available; check its Web site for 
specials.
Taxis are another option when your party has enough people. The stan-
dard rates for Ace Metro (% 407-855-0564) and Yellow Cab (% 407-
699-9999) run as high as $3.25 for the first mile and $1.75 per mile there-
after, although you can sometimes get a flat rate. A one-way trip to the 
I-Drive area could cost upwards of $30, to Disney closer to $60, and to
the U.S. 192 area expect to pay around $50. Vans and taxis load on the
ground level of the airport.
If you’re bunking at the Mouse’s house, Disney’s Magical Express will
transport you and your luggage (which the Mouse will magically retrieve
from baggage claim, allowing you to bypass the backaches and head
straight to the shuttle) from the airport (OIA only) to your WDW resort —
and it’s free (saving a family of four about $100 or more). See Chapter 9 
for details.
A few hotels offer free shuttle service to and from the airport, so be sure
to ask when booking your room. Hotel shuttles load on the ground level.
If you’re driving from the airport with a rental car, you have two options.
You can take the north exit out of the airport to 528 West (a toll road, also
known as the Beeline Expressway). Follow the signs to I-4, then go west
to exits marked for Disney (you’ll find three), and follow the signs to the
appropriate area. Your drive should take about 30 to 40 minutes if traffic
isn’t too heavy. Disney exits are clearly marked on big green signs. This
route is also best if you’re heading to Universal Orlando, SeaWorld, or the
International Drive area. If your destination is solely Disney, you can also
take the south exit from the airport, which leads you down Boggy Creek
Road to S.R. 417 West (another toll road known as the Greeneway). Exit
onto 536 and follow the signs straight into Disney. This route has less
traffic but costs about an extra dollar in tolls.
When you’re traveling from Orlando Sanford Airport, a rental car is
really your best bet — even if you only rent it for the days you arrive and
depart Orlando (if this is the case, choose a company with locations in or
near your hotel for pickups and drop-offs). Taxi or shuttle service from
the airport is expensive; expect a minimum fare of $60 to the Universal
Orlando and International Drive areas and a minimum fare of $100 to the
Disney and Kissimmee areas.
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 81

Upon leaving Sanford airport, exit onto Lake Mary Boulevard. From here,
you can take the 417/Greeneway exit and follow that to Disney. Or you
can go past that exit and take the one for I-4 West, which leads you past
downtown to all the major theme-park attractions. Again, the Greeneway
is the less-traveled, faster route, but it’s a toll road. For either route,
expect about 45 minutes to the Universal Orlando and International
Drive areas and about 60 minutes to Disney (even longer if you’re driv-
ing I-4 between 3 and 6 p.m.).
Figuring Out the Neighborhoods
Though the area encompassing the various theme parks and their
accompanying paraphernalia (hotels, restaurants, and so on) is almost
always referred to as Orlando, the region is actually made up of some
very distinct sections, several of which are not actually in Orlando
proper at all.
Walt Disney World
The empire, its big and little parks, resorts, restaurants, shops, and
assorted trimmings, are scattered across 30,500 acres, or a total area of
about 41 square miles. What you may find most surprising is that WDW
isn’t really located in Orlando at all — it’s just southwest of the city, off 
I-4 between West U.S. 192 and S.R. 535. If you choose to stay with Mickey,
you’ll find that convenience has its price. Accommodations at the
Mouse’s house can run as much as double the price of nearby Kissimmee
hotels and resorts. On the plus side, you get access to the free Disney
Transportation system (though at times that may not be that big of plus)
and a handful of perks and privileges (such as early park entry and extra
evening hours) that are extended only to Disney resort guests.
Also on Disney property is Downtown Disney, an area off to itself
encompassing three very distinctive zones: Downtown Disney West
Side and Pleasure Island, Disney’s two nighttime entertainment dis-
tricts, and Downtown Disney Marketplace, the nearby shopping dis-
trict. Combined, they’re filled with restaurants, shops, entertainment
venues, and clubs; each zone is quite unique in its offerings, atmos-
phere, and price. Downtown Disney is closest to the Lake Buena Vista
zone described in the following section.
Even if you’re not staying or driving in Mickeyville, getting a map of the
Disney Transportation system is a good idea, so you can see where every-
thing is. It’s currently included in Disney’s Planning Guide to Recreation,
Dining, and Shopping, which is free and available at the Guest Relations
desks inside all the Disney hotels and theme parks.
Lake Buena Vista
Lake Buena Vista is Disney’s next-door neighborhood. It’s where you find
“official” (yet not Disney-owned) hotels, and it’s close to Downtown

Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 83

Disney and all its offerings. This charming area has manicured lawns,
tree-lined thoroughfares, and free transportation throughout the realm,
but it may take a while to get from point A to point B because of a combi-
nation of slow shuttle service and heavy traffic. There is a plethora of
shops, services, and restaurants practically at your doorstep, and all
within minutes from the Mouse. Although this area is not nearly as
costly as Walt Disney World itself, it’s generally more expensive than
International Drive and Kissimmee.
Celebration
Imagine an entire town designed by Disney, with perfect white picket
fences, tree-lined walkways, and gingerbread-trimmed houses. In
Celebration, Disney redesigned reality to reflect an idealized version of
Small Town, U.S.A. The 4,900-acre town has thousands of residents living
in beautiful colonial-and Victorian-inspired homes. Celebration’s down-
town area is designed, however, for tourists, though it does have charm-
ing appeal. It’s filled with upscale shops, boutiques, restaurants, and
coffee shops, and it even has its own small, yet elegant, hotel.
Kissimmee
Way back before Mickey moved to town, Kissimmee was the hotspot.
Overlooked, in recent years, with the expansion of the International
Drive and Lake Buena Vista tourist districts, Kissimmee is being revived
and made more tourist-friendly with the addition of wide walkways,
landscaping, and improved roadways. Although still filled with some of
the tackier T-shirt shops and tourist traps in the area, some moderately
priced hotels and even a few luxury resorts have begun to spring up just
to the south. Kissimmee is only a short drive (roughly 10–15 miles)
southeast from the House of Mouse. With plenty of modest motels and
resorts, it’s a great choice for travelers on a budget. The town centers 
on U.S. 192/Irlo Bronson Memorial Highway, which, alas, is perennially
under construction.
International Drive
Known locally as I-Drive, the tourist mecca of International Drive extends
7 to 10 miles north of the Disney kingdom between Highway 535 and the
Florida Turnpike. With bungee jumping, skateboarding, surfing, shopping,
themed restaurants, more than a hundred hotels, and a slew of shops,
this stretch of road is the tourist strip in Central Florida. It’s home to
Orlando’s Official Visitor Center and offers easy access to SeaWorld and
Universal Orlando. The northern half of I-Drive beyond Sand Lake Road is
already packed, and developers continue to eat up space in the southern
half, especially near the Orange County Convention Center; south of the
Beeline Expressway (528) the resorts become far more spread out than in
the north. Traffic along this route is perennially problematic, so be sure
to allot plenty of extra time if you’re traveling on it during the morning
and evening rush hours.
Part III: Settling into Orlando 
84

Dr. Phillips
Once a nondescript residential area dotted with a few odd shops and
doctors offices, the Sand Lake strip of Dr. Phillips, just west of I-4, has
been developed into an upscale shopping and dining mecca. The new
mall complexes at the intersection of West Sand Lake Road and Dr.
Phillips Boulevard now host no fewer than a dozen fine dining restau-
rants. For a quiet and sophisticated dining experience, outside the com-
motion of the theme parks, this is by far your best bet.
Downtown Orlando
Right off I-4 East, Downtown Orlando is actually north of the theme-park
areas and is home to loads of clubs, shops, cultural attractions, and
restaurants. Dozens of antiques shops line Antique Row on Orange
Avenue near Lake Ivanhoe. Hotels in this area are mostly aimed at busi-
ness travelers, because this is also the commercial center of the city and
not at all a convenient place to stay if visiting the theme parks is the
major point of your trip to Orlando. A few B&Bs draw couples seeking
more sophisticated surroundings, and it is a great place for a night out
on the town.
Winter Park
Just north of downtown Orlando, the quiet town of Winter Park is where
many of Central Florida’s old-money families call home (and where the
newly moneyed come to shop and dine). It’s noteworthy for Park
Avenue, a collection of upscale shops and restaurants along a tree-lined,
cobblestone street. Winter Park’s appeal comes from its sophisticated,
yet charming, upscale offerings and has little, if any, kid appeal. It’s defi-
nitely too far north to use as a home base if you plan on spending much
of your time at the Disney parks. If you want some quiet time away from
the theme-park madness, though, it’s a nice place to spend an afternoon
(but leave the kids behind).
Finding Information After You Arrive
After you’ve landed, your best and most immediate source for up-to-date
information is the concierge or the front desk at your hotel (especially if
you’re staying at Disney or Universal, as they’re more knowledgeable
than most).
If you’re in the International Drive area, stop for information at Orlando’s
Official Visitor Center, 8723 International Dr. (% 407-363-5872; www.
orlandoinfo.com), just four blocks south of Sand Lake Road.
Both the Orlando Weekly (distributed every Thurs) and Friday’s calen-
dar section in the Orlando Sentinel include plenty of tourist-friendly
information about dining and entertainment.
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 85

At Orlando International Airport, arriving passengers can find assistance
at the Magic of Disney (third level, right behind the Northwest Airlines
ticket counter) and Disney Earport (across from the Hyatt Regency), two
shops located in the main terminal. They sell Disney multiday park tick-
ets; make dinner, show, and hotel reservations; and provide brochures
and information. The stores open daily at 7 a.m. with Disney Earport clos-
ing at 9 p.m. and the Magic of Disney at 10 p.m.
Also in the main terminal at the airport, you’ll find two locations each 
of the Universal Studios Store and the SeaWorld Store, as well as a
Kennedy Space Center Store. All provide similar services with ticketing
and are open daily from 7 a.m. to either 9 or 10 p.m.
Getting Around Orlando
Your major decision regarding Orlando transportation will be whether 
to use Walt Disney World’s transportation system (which is truly useful
only to those staying at a WDW resort), use a car (yours or a rental), or
stick to other means. The system that works best for you depends on
what you want to see, where you’re staying, and how much time (and
money) you want to spend getting around the city.
By the Disney Transportation system
If you plan to stay at a Disney resort or an official hotel (see Chapter 9
for more information about Disney hotels) and spend the majority of
your time visiting Disney parks, you can probably skip a rental car — at
least for most of your stay. A free transportation network runs through
Disney World. Buses, ferries, water taxis, and monorails operate from
two hours prior to the parks’ opening until two hours after closing.
Likewise, Disney offers service to Downtown Disney, Typhoon Lagoon,
Blizzard Beach, Pleasure Island, Fort Wilderness Resort & Campground,
and all the Disney resorts.
Here are the advantages of using the Disney Transportation system:
 It’s free.
 You save on car-rental and gasoline charges.
 You don’t have to pay $9 a day to park in the theme-park lots.
(Note: Disney resort guests are exempt from parking fees at the
theme parks.)
 If your party wants to split up, you can easily head elsewhere while
others remain behind without being stranded.
 During busy periods when Disney’s parking lots may close (and this
does happen), those riding Disney Transportation will still get to
the parks.
Part III: Settling into Orlando 
86

Disadvantages include the following:
 You’re at the mercy of Disney’s schedule.
 The shortest distance between two points is not always a straight
line. You may very well have to take a ferry to catch a bus to get on
the monorail to reach your hotel. The system makes a complete cir-
cuit, but doesn’t necessarily travel the most direct route for you. It
can take an hour or more to get somewhere that’s right across a
lagoon from you.
 You must endure multiple stops, particularly on buses and at 
peak periods, with crowds that may well force you to wait for the
next bus.
 Parents may find herding young children and their accompanying
paraphernalia off and on buses exhausting.
If you plan to travel on Disney Transportation, first verify with the
driver, the bell staff, or someone at your hotel’s Guest Relations desk
that you’re taking the most direct route. Keep asking questions along the
way. Unlike missing a highway exit, missing a stop on the bus route
means you have to take another ride on the Mickey-go-round.
By car
Most visitors to Orlando — especially those staying a week or more —
choose to rent a car for at least a day or two in order to venture beyond
the parks. (Yes, there is far more to Florida than its thrills and theme
parks.) See Chapter 7 for more information on renting a car in Orlando;
check out the Quick Concierge for toll-free numbers of various car-rental
agencies.
Orlando’s major artery is Interstate 4. Locals call it I-4 or that #@$*%^#!!
road, because it’s often horridly congested, especially during weekday
rush hours (7–9 a.m. and 4–6 p.m.), when it more likely resembles a
parking lot. I-4 runs diagonally across the state from Tampa to Daytona
Beach. Exits from I-4 lead to all WDW properties, Universal Orlando,
SeaWorld, International Drive, U.S. 192, Kissimmee, Lake Buena Vista,
downtown Orlando, and Winter Park. Most of the exits are well marked,
but construction is common and exit numbers occasionally change. If
you get directions by exit number, always ask for the name of the road
as well, to avoid getting lost. (Cellphone users can call % 511 to get a
report of I-4 delays.)
Despite the fact that when you look at any map of the area it will seem
that I-4 runs north to south, on road signs, it’s always listed as east and
west. To avoid getting lost, remember that I-4 west takes you toward
Disney World (and Tampa) from Universal Orlando, I-Drive, and down-
town Orlando; I-4 east heads from Disney and Kissimmee toward
Universal Orlando (and Daytona).
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 87

The Florida Turnpike crosses I-4 near Universal Orlando and links with 
I-75 to the north. U.S. 192, a major east–west artery that’s also called 
the Irlo Bronson Memorial Highway, reaches from Kissimmee to U.S. 27,
crossing I-4 near the WDW entrance road. Farther north, the Beeline
Expressway toll road (or Hwy. 528) goes east from I-4 past Orlando
International Airport to Cape Canaveral and the Kennedy Space Center.
The East-West Expressway (also known as Hwy. 408) is another toll road
that runs from I-4 near downtown east to S.R. 50 by the University of
Central Florida. The final major toll road, S.R. 417 (also known as the
Greeneway), partially encircles the eastern edge of Orlando starting at 
I-4 just south of Disney and winds past the southern edge of Orlando
International Airport before ending up near the northern edge of
Orlando by the Orlando Sanford Airport.
One of the area’s lesser known roads, Turkey Lake Road runs parallel to
I-4 and is often used by locals to avoid the heavy traffic of I-4 from WDW
to Universal Orlando. It starts as the Palm Parkway near Disney and
turns into Turkey Lake Road just past the hotel area, eventually running
right up to Universal. It intersects with both Central Florida Parkway,
which takes you right to SeaWorld, and Sand Lake Road, which takes you
to both Dr. Phillips and the I-Drive areas.
Here are a few (in some cases, redundant) tips for driving in Orlando:
 Remember to allow for rush-hour traffic from 7 to 9 a.m. and 4 to 
6 p.m. daily.
 In Florida, you can turn right on red after coming to a full stop and
making sure that the coast is clear (unless signs say otherwise).
Consider yourself warned: If you’re sitting at a red light with your
blinker on and not turning right, you’ll probably hear horns blaring.
Make sure that your path is clear and then move it.
 Posted speed limits are enforced vigorously. Fines for speeding
begin at more than $150. Pay particular attention to road construc-
tion and school zones, where speed limits are reduced and speed-
ing fines are doubled — they’re not kidding.
 You must have a handicap permit to park in handicap parking
places. Handicap permits from other states are honored, but a dis-
abled license plate alone won’t do.
 Buckle up: Florida law says front- and rear-seat passengers alike
must wear a seat belt. This includes children, who, if younger than
age 5, must be restrained in an approved safety seat (seat belt or
booster seat) and, if younger than age 3, in an approved car seat. If
you don’t want to bring your own from home, most car-rental agen-
cies can provide one for about $10 a day.
 In an emergency, dial % 911, or you can reach the Florida Highway
Patrol on a cellphone by dialing % *FHP.

88

By taxi
Yellow Cab (% 407-699-9999) and Ace Metro (% 407-855-0564) are
among the taxicab companies serving the Orlando area. But for day-to-
day travel to and from the attractions or restaurants, cabs are expensive
unless your group has five or more people. Rates can run as high as
$3.25 for the first mile and $1.75 per mile thereafter, though sometimes
you can get a flat rate.
By shuttle
Mears Transportation Group (% 407-423-5566; www.mears
transportation.com) operates shuttle buses to all major attractions,
including Universal Orlando, SeaWorld, and Disney. Shuttles also run to
Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral and Busch Gardens in Tampa,
and it is also one of the most cost effective of all the shuttle services
available. (For more about great attractions just outside Orlando, see
Chapter 23.) Rates vary by destination.
By trolley
The I-Ride Trolley on International Drive (% 407-248-9590; www.iride
trolley.com) runs every 20 to 30 minutes, from 8 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. ($1
for adults, 25¢ for seniors, kids younger than 12 ride free; exact change
is required). An unlimited one-day pass is available for $3 per person.
The main route runs from the Belz Factory Outlet Malls to SeaWorld with
an additional route that runs along Universal Boulevard from Sea World
Road to Kirkman Road. Because of I-Drive’s heavy traffic, the trolley is
usually the best way to get around whenever you’re staying or spending
the day in this area.
By motorcycle
If you have a valid motorcycle license, you can rent bikes at Orlando
Harley Davidson, 3770 37th St. (% 877-740-3770 or 407-423-0346; www.
orlandoharley.com), and American V Twin, 5135 International Dr. 
(% 800-268-8946 or 407-903-0058; www.amvtwin.com). Their inventories
can be in short supply, so call in advance. You must be at least 21 (and
sometimes 25) years of age, have a motorcycle license, and have a major
credit card. 
Reserve months in advance when you’re visiting during Bike Week — 
in late February and early March — or Biketober Fest in mid-October.
(Both events are held in Daytona Beach, but many bikers still stay in
Orlando.)
By bus
Lynx (% 407-841-5969; www.golynx.com) public bus stops are marked
with a paw print. Some bus routes serve Disney, Universal Orlando,
International Drive, and the downtown area ($1.50 for adults, 75¢ for
kids grades K–12), but they’re slow-going and not very visitor-friendly.
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 89

On foot
I don’t recommend traveling on foot anywhere in Orlando, but it is occa-
sionally necessary to walk across a parking lot or street. Be extremely
careful. With rare exception, this city isn’t conducive to strolling. Within
the safe confines of the theme parks, you’ll have no problems hoofing it
(in fact, you’ll be on your feet quite a bit), but walking anywhere outside
the theme parks is a thrills-and-chills experience most people would
prefer to avoid. Orlando is among the most dangerous cities in the coun-
try for pedestrians, according to a Washington, D.C.–based research
group. Wide roads designed to move traffic quickly and a shortage of
sidewalks, streetlights, and crosswalks are to blame.

W
here you plant yourself during your Orlando vacation determines
many things about your trip, including your itineraries, the amount
of money you spend, and your need, if any, for a car rental. Deciding
where to stay in the city isn’t easy because its 114,000 rooms come in
many different flavors: hotels, motels, bed-and-breakfasts (B&Bs), and so
on. Lucky for you, in this chapter I show you how to narrow your choices.
Getting to Know Your Options
Something you can take to the bank: Unlike the less competitive areas 
of Florida, almost all hotels in Orlando — at least the ones listed in this
guide — have been either built or renovated in the past 10 or 12 years
(though it’s likely renovations have been closer to within the last 1–4
years), so you can expect reasonably modern trimmings. The city some-
times seems like Chain Central, and you’ll find branches of pretty much
every major hotel and motel chain in the major tourist zones, especially
on International Drive and in Kissimmee. Note that even the high-end
properties tend to have a more relaxed feel than counterparts in other
cities thanks to the theme parks; you’re more likely to see Goofy hats
than Gucci ones here. (See the Quick Concierge for a list of the major
hotel chains’ toll-free numbers.)
Every hotel that I list in this chapter has air-conditioning and at least
one pool (or I tell you otherwise). Most have cable TV, and some offer 
in-room movies, Internet connections, and Nintendo for a fee. Likewise,
many have hair dryers, coffeemakers, and in-room safes. Almost all

hotels in the city (with a few exceptions that I alert you to) offer free
parking, but few hotels these days throw in breakfast with your room
rate (most that do tend to fall on the lower end of the price scale). Most
places in Orlando try to make kids feel as if they’re Mickey’s favorite rel-
atives and offer lots of little extras and amenities for families. Although
that’s great for parents, Orlando (believe it or not) is the top honeymoon
destination in the United States, so there are plenty of places that cater
to adults, too.
Avoiding children for almost any length of time during your visit is next
to impossible, but if you’re childfree and don’t relish the thought of
screaming kids in the room next door, there are ways to improve your
odds. The bad news is that the quiet definitely costs you. As a general
rule — Disney and Universal Orlando properties not included — the
more expensive a hotel is, the less likely you are to run into children
(but keep in mind that even the business hotels here still cater to the
family market in some form or another). Some of Orlando’s B&Bs don’t
allow children younger than 16 to stay as guests, and these often feature
luxurious rooms that rival those of the big resorts. If you don’t want to
spend the extra money, remember that few people spend much time in
their rooms anyway.
Price and location, when all is said and done, are the factors that really
decide where you rest your head for the night. Although you pay more
for the best locations, you may find these hotels well worth the conven-
iences they offer. The closer your hotel is to the things you want to do
and see, the less time and money you waste getting to your destination.
And that’s why the two major players in town are deserving of a closer
look.
Walt Disney World
Disney has the corner on the Orlando hotel market, boasting high occu-
pancy rates even during slow times. There are 22 Disney-owned-and-
operated resorts and nine official hotels — those that are privately
owned but have earned Disney’s seal of approval — located on WDW
property.
Disney’s accommodations run the gamut from motel-style rooms to
grand villas with full kitchens. The decision to bunk (or not to bunk)
with the Mouse is probably the most important one you make regarding
your accommodations. To decide whether an on-property stay is right
for you, consider these facts: The benefits of lodging in Mickey’s back-
yard include the following:
 You get unlimited free transportation via the Disney Transportation
system’s buses, monorails, ferries, and water taxis to and from the
four theme parks, resorts, and smaller attractions. This also means
you’re guaranteed admission to all the parks, even during peak
times when parking lots fill to capacity and many folks not staying
with Mickey are left in the cold.
Part III: Settling into Orlando 
92

 You can take advantage of free parking inside theme-park lots if you
choose to chauffeur yourself. Other visitors pay $10 a day.
 Kids younger than 17 stay free in their parent’s room, and reduced-
price children’s menus are available in most restaurants.
 You have access to some of the best hotel pools in all of Orlando.
 Resort guests can charge most purchases (including meals) made
anywhere inside WDW to their rooms. You can also usually have
your purchases delivered to your resort at no extra charge, so you
don’t have to lug them around the park with you all day.
 You can purchase WDW park and attraction tickets right at your
hotel’s Guest Relations or concierge desk, avoiding the often long
lines at the parks themselves. (See Chapter 11 for more on WDW
admission options.) You can also make reservations for dining and
preferred tee times at Disney’s golf courses through Guest Relations
or the concierge.
 No resorts are more convenient to the Disney parks and attractions.
 The Extra Magic Hours allows resort guests before- and after-hours
admission to one of the four theme parks or two water parks. Disney
distributes a schedule that lists which parks are open extra hours on
what days and at what times (for information, see Chapter 11).
 Disney’s Magical Express Service transports you and your luggage
from the airport to your resort if you fly via participating airlines
(currently Alaska Airlines, American, Continental, Delta, JetBlue,
Northwest, Ted, and United) to Orlando International Airport (and
have arranged to use the service prior to departure). Thanks to
special luggage tags (sent to you via mail) and some of Mickey’s
magic, your luggage will appear in your resort room without your
ever having to retrieve it from baggage claim in Orlando (though it
may take up to three hours, so bring along a carryon with any
items you may need immediately). You will be transported (round-
trip) to your resort at no additional charge in a special Disney shut-
tle. Other great perks include the ability to check in and print your
boarding pass (domestic flights only) prior to departing from your
resort, therefore avoiding at least one line at the airport. (Note:
Northwest does not currently participate, and certain restrictions
apply with other airlines.) Be sure to keep your Magical Express
documents handy — you need your vouchers to ride the shuttle
(each way). Also note that your shuttle back to the airport is deter-
mined by your flight departure time and will be at least three hours
prior to your flight. If you revise your plans or have questions, call
Magical Express Guest Services (% 866-599-0951). This free serv-
ice is currently scheduled to be available through 2011.
Chapter 9: Checking In at Orlando’s Best Hotels 93

The drawbacks of staying with the Mouse include the following:
 Disney Transportation can be excruciatingly time-consuming and
at times difficult to maneuver with young children and all their
paraphernalia.
 Resort rates are about 20 to 30 percent higher than prices at com-
parable hotels and motels located beyond the parks’ boundaries.
 You may wind up a prisoner of Disney, unable to avoid the stiff pric-
ing for meals, trinkets, and so on.
 Without your own vehicle, it’s difficult and expensive to leave
Disney property to experience the rest of what Orlando has to offer
(which is quite a bit).
Universal Orlando
Universal Orlando is actually a relatively new player on the Orlando
hotel scene and only boasts three properties (though plans to tack on at
least two more in the future have been drawn up). The Universal resorts
are all operated by the luxury Loews Hotel group and the standard of
accommodations is actually a bit better than the majority of those at
Disney. If your itinerary favors Universal Orlando, staying at one of its
three properties affords you some rather meaningful perks at the
Universal parks.
The benefits of staying at one of Universal’s three resorts include the 
following:
 Unlimited free transportation via water taxi or bus from the resorts
to CityWalk and both Universal parks.
 Unlike Disney, Universal Orlando’s smaller number of resorts
means everything really is within walking distance of the parks.
 Resort guests enjoy special privileges at the Universal Orlando
theme parks, including Universal Express (unlimited express-line
access to rides), preferred seating at shows, as well as many of the
restaurants from the day of check-in to the day of check-out. This is
a huge benefit, especially during the more crowded months when
lines can be excruciatingly long. Just show your room key and
you’ll get to the fun that much faster. Additionally, guests are
allowed early entry to the parks on scheduled days.
 Universal’s resorts all accept pets, so Fido or Fluffy can live the lux-
urious lifestyle right along with you instead of having to be rele-
gated to a kennel. They even offer a special pet program that
includes food, supplies, and walking services.
The drawbacks of staying at the Universal resorts are as follows:
Part III: Settling into Orlando 
94

 Although there is shuttle service to SeaWorld and Wet ’n Wild from
the resorts, you’ll have to arrange your own transportation if you
want to set foot on Disney property.
 Resort rates are at least 30 percent higher than at comparable
hotels and motels located even a block from the parks (though,
honestly, few are really comparable). You won’t find anything for
under $100 a night.
 As when staying at a Disney resort, you’re subjected to higher
prices for dining and other vacation necessities.
 Universal resorts don’t offer free parking (it costs $10 a day), which
is a perk of staying at Disney theme-park hotels.
Finding the Best Room at the Best Rate
The rack rate is the published (and usually the maximum) rate a hotel
charges for a room. It’s the rate you get if you walk in off the street and
ask for a room for the night. You sometimes see these rates printed on
the fire/emergency exit diagrams posted on the back of your door.
Hotels are happy to charge you the rack rate, but you can almost always
do better. Perhaps the best way to avoid paying the rack rate is surpris-
ingly simple: Just ask for a cheaper or discounted rate and it’s likely
you’ll get one.
Reserving a room through the hotel’s toll-free number may also result in
a lower rate than calling the hotel directly. On the other hand, the cen-
tral reservations number may not know about discount rates at specific
locations. Your best bet is to call both the local number and the toll-free
number and see which one gives you a better deal. Whatever you do,
don’t ever come to town without a reservation. Orlando is a year-round
destination, it has a heavy convention and business trade, and school
lets out during varying times of the year in other nations. If you come
without a reservation, you may find yourself extremely disappointed —
or even completely out of luck.
If you’re a student, senior, military or government employee (or retiree),
or a member of AAA or AARP, ask about discounts. The Orlando/Orange
County Convention & Visitors Bureau’s free Magicard (% 800-643-9492;
www.orlandoinfo.com) is good for a family of six and offers hundreds of
dollars in discounts on area accommodations, car rentals, attractions, and
restaurants. The Entertainment Book (www.entertainmentbook.com) is
another good source for discounts on hotels, car rentals, restaurants, and
attractions. It costs $30 for the Orlando version, but you’ll recoup your
investment after using just a few coupons.
As a rule, Disney resorts, villas, and official hotels don’t offer regular 
discounts other than for slight seasonal variations. WDW’s 2006 value
seasons or lowest rates were available from January 1 to February 15,
August 27 to October 4 (except Labor Day weekend), and November 26
Chapter 9: Checking In at Orlando’s Best Hotels 95

to December 19. Regular season rates were available from April 23 to
August 26 and October 5 to November 25. Peak rates applied from
February 16 to April 22, and holiday rates took effect from December 20
to December 31. Although the actual dates will shift a little (and those
listed are for the value, moderate, and deluxe resorts and vary slightly
for the campgrounds and vacation-club–level resorts), the same periods
should apply in 2007.
One of the best ways to catch a break from Mickey’s prices is through a
travel package (see Chapter 5). Disney offers vacation plans that can
include meals, tickets, recreation, airfare, rentals, dinner shows, and
other features. Call the Central Reservations Office (% 407-934-7639)
or go to www.disneyworld.com to book rooms and packages or to get
the lowdown on WDW, including vacation brochures and DVDs.
Before calling Disney to make reservations, take a moment to visit
MouseSavers.com (www.mousesavers.com). This unofficial Disney dis-
count site is extremely diligent about keeping up-to-date listings on all
discounts offered by Disney, whether it be room discount codes or
details on special package deals. Spending a few minutes looking over
the listings can save you hundreds of dollars when booking direct with
Disney.
When booking your room, don’t forget to allow for the area’s combined
sales and resort taxes. In Orange County (Orlando, Lake Buena Vista,
Winter Park, and Maitland), the tax is 11 percent. In Osceola County
(Kissimmee/St. Cloud), the taxes add 12 percent to your bill.
When making your reservation, ask some pointed questions to make
sure that you have the best room in the house. For example, always 
ask for a corner room. They’re usually larger and quieter, include more
windows and light than standard rooms, and don’t always cost more.
Likewise, ask which floor and side has the best view, if there is one, as
well as whether the hotel is renovating (if so, request a room away from
the renovation work). You can also ask about the location of the restau-
rants, bars, and clubs in the hotel — these may be a source of irritating
noise. If you aren’t happy with your room when you arrive, talk to the
front-desk staff. If they have another room, they’ll likely accommodate
you — within reason, of course.
Surfing the Web for Hotel Deals
Shopping online for hotels is generally done one of two ways: by booking
through the hotel’s own Web site or through an independent booking
agency (or a fare-service agency like Priceline). These Internet hotel agen-
cies have multiplied in mind-boggling numbers of late, competing for the
business of millions of consumers surfing for accommodations around the
world. This competitiveness can be a boon to consumers who have the
patience and time to shop and compare the online sites for good deals —
but shop they must, for prices can vary considerably from site to site. And
Part III: Settling into Orlando 
96

keep in mind that hotels at the top of a site’s listing may be there for no
other reason than that they paid money to get the placement.
You almost never find a WDW resort on any discounter’s Web site (how-
ever, Disney’s All-Star Resorts were recently spotted on Priceline). If you
want to book a Disney hotel online, you have to go through a packager
or Disney’s own Web site, (www.disneyworld.com). Each individual
resort is listed on the site and information is available on rooms, rates,
floor plans, restaurants, recreation, and so on. Generally, the only hotels
on Disney property that you can book through a discounter are the “offi-
cial” hotels.
Of the “big three” sites, Expedia offers a long list of special deals and 
virtual tours or photos of available rooms so you can see what you’re
paying for (a feature that helps counter the claims that the best rooms
are often held back from bargain-booking Web sites). Travelocity posts
unvarnished customer reviews and ranks its properties according to the
AAA rating system. Also reliable are Hotels.com and Quikbook.com. An
excellent free program, TravelAxe (www.travelaxe.net), can help you
search multiple hotel sites at once, even ones you may never have heard
of — and conveniently lists the total price of the room, including the
taxes and service charges. It covers a large number of Orlando’s best
hotels, and I heartily recommend giving it a try.
Another booking site, Travelweb (www.travelweb.com), is partly
owned by the hotels it represents (including the Hilton, Hyatt, and
Starwood chains), so it’s plugged directly into the hotels’ reservations
systems — unlike independent online agencies, which have to fax or
e-mail reservation requests to the hotel, a good portion of which get 
misplaced in the shuffle. More than once, travelers have arrived at the
hotel, only to be told that they have no reservation (to help avoid this
verify your reservations with the hotel directly). To be fair, many of the
major sites are undergoing improvements in service and ease of use, and
Expedia will soon be able to plug directly into the reservations systems
of many hotel chains — none of which can be bad news for consumers.
In the meantime, it’s a good idea to get a confirmation number and make
a printout of any online booking transaction.
In the opaque Web site category, Priceline and Hotwire are even better
for hotels than for airfares; with both, you’re allowed to pick the neigh-
borhood and quality level of your hotel before offering up your money.
Priceline’s hotel product even covers Europe and Asia, though it’s much
better at getting five-star lodging for three-star prices than at finding any-
thing at the bottom of the scale. On the downside, many hotels stick
Priceline guests in their least desirable rooms. Be sure to go to the
BiddingForTravel.com before bidding on a hotel room on Priceline; it
features a fairly up-to-date list of hotels that Priceline uses in major cities.
For both Priceline and Hotwire, you pay upfront, and the fee is nonre-
fundable. Note: Some hotels do not provide loyalty-program credits or
points or other frequent-stay amenities when you book a room through
opaque online services.
Chapter 9: Checking In at Orlando’s Best Hotels 97

Arriving Without a Reservation
My first bit of advice: Don’t come to Orlando without a reservation. If
you do, you’re more likely to end up feeling like Grumpy than Happy.
This advice is especially true when it’s high-travel season and rooms are
both pricey and scarce. If you do decide, however, to head for Orlando
on the spur of the moment, you’ll want to pursue a few options before
setting up camp in your car.
Orlando’s Official Visitors Center is related to the Orlando/Orange
County Convention & Visitors Bureau. These folks find last-minute
rooms for nonplanners. Room rates, depending on the season, can be 
a bargain. However, you can get a room only for the night you visit the
center, and you have to come in person to find out what is available. The
Visitors Center is located in Orlando at 8723 International Drive, a mile
west of Sand Lake Road (% 407-363-5872 for information only).
Your only other option is to try the reservation service listed in the
“Surfing the Web for Hotel Deals” section, above.
Orlando’s Best Hotels
All the rates in this section are per-night double occupancy, but many
accommodations, including all Disney resorts, allow kids younger than
17 to stay free with their parents or grandparents (as long as the number
of guests doesn’t exceed the maximum occupancy). However, always ask
about rates for kids when booking your room. Also, unless otherwise
noted, all the hotels in this section offer free self-parking.
To make it easy for you to recognize expensive versus moderately
priced hotels, each of the following entries includes one or more $ sym-
bols (see Table 9-1 for the meaning behind the symbols). In general,
expect higher hotel prices on the more upscale digs as well as those in
or near the attractions. Almost every hotel in Orlando caters to families
with children, but I list hotels, resorts, and inns that are especially good
fits for adults on the “Good for Grown-ups” list on this book’s tear-out
Cheat Sheet.
Several of the properties in this chapter add resort fees that can range
from $5 to upwards of $15 to their daily room rates. That’s part of an
unfortunate but growing hotel trend of charging for services that used to
be included in the rates, such as use of the pool, admission to the health
club, or in-room coffeemaker, safe, or phone (each hotel varies greatly).
If it’s a concern, ask whether your hotel charges such a fee (and just
what it’s for) when booking so you don’t get blindsided at checkout. At
some hotels, the fee is optional and you don’t need to pay it if you don’t
use the amenities or recreational facilities it covers.

Less than $100
Accommodations at this level generally include
basic trimmings and limited space. They also lean
toward the no-frills side. Those at the higher end
may offer amenities such as hair dryers, coffeemak-
ers, cable TV, a midsize pool, a kids’ play area, and
continental breakfast. If they’re multistory, they also
usually have an elevator.
$$
$101–$200
Lodgings in this price range probably offer a choice
of king-size or double beds, possibly suites if they fall
in the higher end, a full range of amenities (hair
dryer; coffeemaker; two TVs in the two-room
models; multiline phones and, possibly, a modem
line; VCR; free daily newspaper; and designer sham-
poos), and room service. Rooms are slightly larger,
and a Jacuzzi and fitness center may accompany
the pool. The continental breakfast probably
includes fresh fruit, granola, and muffins rather than
day-old doughnuts and little boxes of cereal. The
hotel may also have at least one palatable on-site
restaurant. Some may have a Guest Services desk
for purchasing attraction tickets and making dinner
arrangements.
$$$
$201–$300
Hotels at this level are sure to have a Guest Services
desk, possibly a concierge. They also usually include
a large, resort-style pool, possibly a second smaller
or toddler pool, and multiple Jacuzzi tubs (some of
the higher-end rooms have their own), a fitness
center, and occasionally a small spa. Rooms gener-
ally have multiple phones, minibars, and a bath and
separate shower. Many rooms are larger, some with
small sitting areas, a pull-out sofa, and large work
desks. Some hotels in this category offer supervised
children’s programs and activities.
$$$$
$301 and up
Nothing in this price range is impossible. In addition
to the amenities in the previous categories, many of
these hotels offer concierge levels, extra-large
rooms, spacious suites, 24-hour room service, gor-
geous pool bars, and live entertainment in their
lounges. Some also include full-service spas, gour-
met restaurants, shopping arcades, and tight secu-
rity. Recreational facilities are usually extensive and
lavish. Many offer supervised children’s programs
and activities.

Best Western Lakeside

Kissimmee
The hand-painted exteriors, lobby, and common areas of this recently ren-
ovated hotel (formerly the La Quinta Inn Lakeside) give it a unique charm
not found in its hotel brethren. Just up the road from the Disney entrance,

A home away from home
If you want all the comforts of home or you are traveling in a group of five or more,
you might consider bypassing hotels or motels in favor of a rental condo or home.
Rates vary widely depending on quality and location, and some may require a two- or
three-night minimum stay. Many of these properties are 5 to 15 miles from the theme
parks and offer no transportation, so having a car is a necessity.
On the upside, most have two to six bedrooms and a convertible couch, two or more
bathrooms, a full kitchen, multiple TVs and phones, and an iron. Some have a washer
and dryer. Homes often have their own private, screen-enclosed pool, while condos
have a common recreation area.
On the downside, rentals can be lacking in services. Most don’t have daily maid serv-
ice, and restaurants can be as far away as the parks (another reason you’ll need a
car). Be sure to check and see if they offer dinnerware, utensils, or salt and pepper
shakers — it generally depends on the level of the home chosen.
Rates range from about $75 to $450 per night ($300–$3,200 per week).
All Star Vacation Homes (% 888-249-1779 or 407-997-0733; www.allstar

into a wide range of luxury and size. Many have private, screened-in pools. A variety

include numerous recreational options (pools, playgrounds, and so on), a

Buena Vista Palace Resort
$$–$$$
Lake Buena Vista/Official WDW Hotel
The hotel’s spacious accommodations are literally across the road from
Downtown Disney. This former Wyndham resort is an ideal spot for hon-
eymooners or those looking for a romantic weekend getaway. Many of the
appealing business-standard rooms have lakeview balconies or patios; ask
for one above the fifth floor with a “recreation view.” Because business-
people make up 75 percent of its guests, the hotel offers some of its best
rates in July and August, contrary to the other Orlando mainstream tourist
resorts. Amenities include three pools, a fully equipped spa, a sauna, a
video arcade, and a restaurant. Rates include free transportation to
Disney; you pay a fee for transportation to the other theme parks.

Celebration Hotel

Kissimmee
Located in the Disney-esque town of Celebration, this upscale and charm-
ingly sophisticated hotel has a three-story, wood-frame design straight out
of 1920s Florida. A bit off the beaten path, it offers a romantic atmosphere
for couples. (Although children are welcome, I wouldn’t suggest bringing
them here.) All rooms offer dataports, safes, hair dryers, and TVs with
Nintendo. Suites and studios have refrigerators and wet bars. Other ameni-
ties include a pool, Jacuzzi, and fitness center. Shops, an 18-hole golf
course, a movie theater, and several restaurants are within walking dis-
tance. A free shuttle to WDW parks and transportation to other parks (for

Comfort Suites Maingate East

Kissimmee
Set back from the main drag, this fairly new and welcoming hotel is one of
the nicest in the area. The lobby and accommodations — consisting of
studio and one-bedroom suites — are bright and inviting. The main pool
and the children’s pool, with an umbrella fountain to keep everyone cool,
are open around the clock. You can keep connected to the real world with
free high-speed Internet access. For entertainment, Old Town (a small-
scale shopping, dining, and entertainment complex) is next door, and a
great miniature golf course is located just in front of the property.

Just across the street from the Best Western Lakeside (see above) and up
the road from WDW, this clean, comfortable place to stay has kept itself
modern and in good shape. The suites have a small dividing wall slightly
separating the living area from the sleeping quarters, but the illusion of
privacy is there. Accommodations are a bit bigger than most and can
squeeze in up to six. A bit of tropical landscaping gives it an inviting atmos-
phere and shelters guests from busy U.S. 192. At least ten restaurants and
a small shopping plaza are within walking distance, and there’s a minia-
ture golf course right across the street.

This charming B&B hideaway is located within walking distance of several
of downtown’s cultural attractions, upscale eateries, and shops. It is made
up of several historic buildings: The Norment-Parry Inn is an 1883
Victorian-style home with six rooms decorated with English and American
antiques; four have sitting rooms, and all have private bathrooms. A hon-
eymoon suite has a walnut bed, a fireplace, and a small, glass-enclosed
porch. The I. W. Phillips House, built in 1919, is a Southern jewel with three
upstairs suites, one with a whirlpool, and all with verandas overlooking
the gardens and fountain. The Dr. Phillips House (1893) and the Wellborn

International Drive Area/Universal Orlando
Sleek, modern, and upscale, this 15-story hotel is close to Universal
Orlando and SeaWorld (about midway between them), although getting to
Disney is no problem because the hotel offers free shuttles to all the major
parks. It’s also close to the I-Ride Trolley, making it easy to get to the many
attractions and eateries lining I-Drive. Subdued, but well-appointed, rooms
offer floor-to-ceiling windows. Some of the pricier rooms are in the Atrium
Tower, where glass elevators climb to the top. Other perks include a fit-
ness center and a heated pool. This place is geared to business travelers
and adults without kids in tow.

Disney’s All-Star Movie Resort
$–$$
Walt Disney World
Kids aren’t the only ones amazed by the, uh, aesthetics of this resort.
When did you last see architecture as inspiring as Goliath-size Dalmatians
leaping from balconies? If you’re not saying, “Oh, brother!” by now you
may enjoy all the larger-than-life versions of a host of other characters
from famous Disney movies (Toy Story, 101 Dalmatians, and Fantasia
among others) that decorate the buildings here, and the low (by Mickey
standards) rates will thrill some travelers. The All-Star Resorts that follow
this listing are pretty much the same, save the theme — expect tiny (260
sq. ft.) rooms and postage-stamp-size bathrooms with few frills but plenty
of families. Either way, you’re “on property,” and you’re enjoying the
lowest prices your Mouse money can buy. This All-Star Resort has a family-
friendly food court that serves pizza, pasta, sandwiches, salads, burgers,
chicken, and family-dinner platters. Room service is very limited. Each of
the All-Star Resorts features a main pool, a smaller second pool, a toddler
pool, and a very small playground, as well as an arcade.

If you insist on staying on Disney property and you’re on a tight budget,
the rates at the All-Star Resort are difficult to beat. But you’d better be

prepared for full-time family togetherness, because the mouse-size rooms
mean you’ll be up close and personal. (They’re about the size of what you
get on a cruise ship if you choose a midprice cabin). Fortunately, recent
remodeling reduced the number of smaller rooms to create 192 family
suites that can sleep up to six and include two bathrooms, a kitchenette,
and a separate master bedroom with a flat-screen TV. But if the idea of
residing in buildings decorated with immense musical notes and other
music-related motifs doesn’t appeal, head elsewhere.

Disney’s All-Star Sports Resort

Walt Disney World
Adjacent to the All-Star Music Resort, this 82-acre property is an instant
replay of its sister All-Stars. It draws sports fans looking for a vacation and
visual overload. The buildings feature football (huge helmets protect stair-
wells from rain), baseball, basketball, tennis, and surfing motifs. Amenities
include a brightly decorated food court, very limited room service, baby-
sitting (from an outside service), a Guest Services desk (a standard at
Disney resorts), pools, and a video arcade. Like its two siblings (listed
above), the All-Star Sports Resort is fairly isolated in WDW’s southwest
corner. Renting a car is a far better choice than relying on the Disney
Transportation system if you want to get anywhere quickly.

Disney’s Animal Kingdom Lodge
$$$–$$$$
Walt Disney World
Disney’s newest arrival offers the exotic atmosphere of an African game
preserve. The rooms follow a kraal (semicircular) design, giving guests a
hit-or-miss view of 130 species of birds and 75 giraffes, gazelles, and other
grazing animals on the 30-acre savanna. The huge picture windows in the
lobby offer similar views, while the interior public areas are adorned with
authentic African artwork and artifacts. The rooms are quite comfortable,
although bathrooms are a bit cramped (a problem with many of Disney’s
properties). Two of the best and most unique restaurants (Jiko and Boma)
are located here. Not surprisingly, this resort is the closest you can stay to
Animal Kingdom, but almost everything else on WDW property is quite a
distance away. And although families appreciate the animals and wide
array of activities for kids (not to mention the bunk beds available in some
rooms and the supervised kids’ club), the more relaxed and sedate nature
of the resort also makes it a good spot for couples. A concierge level is
available.

Disney’s Beach Club Resort
$$$$
Walt Disney World
It’s only a brisk walk to Epcot from the Beach Club, which resembles the
grand seaside resorts that once dotted the eastern seaboard around the
turn of the 20th century. The Beach Club’s atmosphere is a bit more casual
than its sister resort (the Yacht Club, listed later), which shares its many
restaurants and recreational facilities. Though still upscale, brightly col-
ored beach umbrellas, seashells, and a casual Cape Cod feel permeate the
resort. Kids love the 3-acre, free-form, sand-bottom swimming pool of
Stormalong Bay, winding its way along the beachfront. Rooms can sleep
up to five, and views range from the pool to the parking lot. The villas sleep
up to eight. Studios have kitchenettes, while the one- and two-bedroom
villas have full kitchens, washer/dryers, and whirlpool baths. All units
come with balconies. The BoardWalk, Swan, and Dolphin resorts are just
a short walk across the bridge, adding their own entertainment and dining
options to the mix. The proximity to the parks (MGM and Epcot especially)
and other resorts makes this one of the best upscale destinations at
Disney, especially for families.

$$$$
Walt Disney World
More than any other Disney property, the BoardWalk Inn appeals to those
looking for a sliver of yesterday. The 1940s “seaside” resort overlooks a
village green and lake. Some of the Cape Cod–style rooms have balconies
(rooms sleep up to five), and the corner units offer a bit more space.
Center rooms on the upper floors facing the lake have the best view of the
nightly fireworks at Epcot. Recreational facilities are extensive and include
two pools set in a lavish Coney Island atmosphere, tennis, fishing, boat-
ing, bike rental, and even a moonlight cruise. The villas sleep up to 12, and
the one-, two-, and three-bedroom villas have full kitchens, washer/dryers,
and whirlpool baths. The resort has a quarter-mile boardwalk reminiscent
of those once made popular along the mid-Atlantic seaboard, featuring
shops, restaurants, and street performers, which means you’ll find plenty
to do after the sun goes down. Note: Rooms overlooking the BoardWalk
have the best views, but they tend to be noisy due to the action below.

Walt Disney World
This moderately priced hotel’s amenities may not be quite as extensive as
those at some of Disney’s higher-end properties (or those in the same class
outside the World), but the hotel still offers great value for families.
Grouped into five Caribbeanisland–themed villages, many of the rooms
offer views out over the beaches and the water. Standard rooms feature
two double beds, small bathrooms, and privacy curtains for a vanity area
with a double sink. The main swimming pool resembles a Spanish-style
fort, and most of the villages have their own basic pool as well. Other
pluses are a nature trail, a small aviary, and a picnic area. The hotel also
has a restaurant, as well as a lively market-style food court. The closest
park is the Disney–MGM Studios, though it can take up to 45 minutes to
get there using Disney Transportation — you’re probably better off rent-
ing a car if you stay here. Note: When booking, ask for a recently refur-
bished room.

Disney’s Contemporary Resort
$$$–$$$$
Walt Disney World
If location is a priority, the Contemporary has one of the best in the World
because the monorail literally runs through the hotel, allowing you a fast
track to Epcot or the Magic Kingdom. The 15-story, A-frame resort —
Disney’s first in Florida — overlooks the manmade Seven Seas Lagoon and
Bay Lake. The original rooms in this tower were built separately and then
slid into the framework, an unusual process befitting the futuristic archi-
tecture. The separate two-story Garden Wing buildings were added sev-
eral years later. Standard rooms are among Disney’s biggest, a plus for
families. The more expensive Tower rooms have the best views, and the
higher floors tend to be quieter. Recent room renovations include an all-
new, upscale décor with an Asian-retro flair that looks amazing. Parents
will appreciate the rounded corners, kid-proof locks on the sliding doors
(remember how high up you are here), and breakables placed out of the
reach of little ones. And did I mention the flat-screen TVs? The pool area
is virtually a mini water park, and many of Disney’s watersports options
are headquartered here. The hotel offers three restaurants, including one
of WDW’s most popular dining spots, the California Grill, and a very pop-
ular character meal at Chef Mickey’s (see Chapter 10).
This is the least Disney-esque of the expensive WDW resorts, and although
the room décor has improved exponentially, the public areas could be
described as business bland, so if you want an all-Mickey atmosphere, stay
elsewhere.

Disney’s Coronado Springs Resort
$$–$$$
Walt Disney World
The spirit of the American Southwest can be felt throughout this moder-
ately priced resort, which has a slightly more upscale feel than others of
its class. Rooms are housed in four- and five-story hacienda-style build-
ings with terra-cotta tile roofs and palm-shaded courtyards. Some over-
look the 15-acre Golden Lake; the better your view, the higher the price.
Rooms feature two double beds (the décor differs in each section, but the
layout is the same), with a small bathroom and dual vanities set inside a
separate niche. Ninety-nine rooms are specially designed to accommodate
travelers with disabilities, and nearly three-quarters of the rooms are non-
smoking. If you like to swim, you’ll delight in the Mayan-temple–inspired
main pool. Dining options include a restaurant and a food court. The near-
est park is Animal Kingdom, but the Coronado is at the southwest corner
of WDW and a good distance from most other areas in the park.

Disney’s Fort Wilderness Resort & Campground
$–$$$
Walt Disney World
This woodsy, 780-acre resort delights campers, but it’s quite a hike from
most of the Disney parks, except the Magic Kingdom (and even it might
feel far away if you use Disney Transportation to get there). Even so, you’ll
have more than enough to keep you busy right here. Guests enjoy exten-
sive recreational facilities, ranging from a riding stable to a video arcade
with fishing, biking, tennis, and swimming among the offerings. Secluded
campsites offer 110/220-volt outlets, barbecue grills, picnic tables, and
kids’ play areas. Wilderness cabins (actually, they’re cleverly disguised
trailers) can sleep up to six people; they also have living rooms, fully
equipped eat-in kitchens, coffeemakers, hair dryers, and barbecue grills.
Nearby Pioneer Hall plays host to the rambunctious Hoop-Dee-Doo
Musical Revue (see Chapter 24) nightly. The nightly campfire and marsh-
mallow roast, followed by a Disney movie, shown right in the great out-
doors, is a big hit with families.
Some sites are open to pets (the ones with full hookups), at an additional
cost of $5 per site — not per pet — which is less expensive than using the
WDW Pet Care Kennels, where you pay $9 per pet.

Disney’s Grand Floridian Resort & Spa
$$$$
Walt Disney World
You won’t find a more luxurious address — in a Victorian sense anyway —
than this 40-acre Great Gatsby–era resort on the shores of the Seven Seas
Lagoon. It’s a great choice for couples seeking a bit of romance, especially
honeymooners who aren’t on a tight budget. Families will appreciate the
extensive recreational facilities that include a child-friendly pool with
waterfalls and play area, organized children’s activities, and character
dining. The Grand Floridian is Walt Disney World’s upper-crust flagship,
and it’s as pricey as it is plush. The opulent, five-story, domed lobby hosts
afternoon teas accompanied by piano music. In the evenings, an orchestra
plays big-band tunes. Virtually all of the inviting Victorian-style rooms
overlook a garden, pool, courtyard, or the Seven Seas Lagoon; many have
balconies and the dormer rooms have vaulted ceilings. The hotel is one of
three on the Disney monorail line. The resort also has a first-rate health
club and spa, as well as five restaurants, including the incomparable
Victoria & Albert (see Chapter 10).

The peace and quiet of a remote locale away from the dizzying Disney
theme-park pace is just part of your reward when you stay here. This
Disney Vacation Club timeshare property mirrors turn-of-the-20th-century
Key West, though the theme is tastefully understated. Pastel colors and
gingerbread trim adorn the charming buildings while palm trees are scat-
tered about, providing a bit of shade along the beaches. Tourists can rent
rooms here when their owners are not using them, and they’re a great
choice for large families or long stays. The accommodations include stu-
dios, along with one-, two-, and three-bedroom villas that have full
kitchens, washer/dryers, Jacuzzis, and balconies. Recreational facilities
are extensive and include beaches, pools, an array of watersports, a play-
ground, a video arcade, and more. There’s a restaurant as well as a large

The 25-acre Polynesian Resort sort of resembles the South Pacific and was
built when Disney first opened its doors. Though it has aged, it still offers
one of the best locations — just across from the Magic Kingdom and right

on the monorail line. The guest rooms, most with balconies or patios, are
reasonably large and sport an all new décor, with muted earth-tone color
schemes that create an island feel, and added amenities that include flat-
screen TVs and refrigerators. The Tahiti and Rapa Nui buildings have
rooms that are slightly larger, but they’re also the farthest from the main
building, dining, and volcano pool area. Numerous recreational activities
are available, including fishing and boat rentals. The Spirit of Aloha Show
(see Chapter 24) is the big nighttime activity here, and ’Ohana is a favorite
restaurant for families because it features kid-friendly activities during the
dinner hour and a lively character meal at breakfast.
Though the South Pacific theme may bring on visions of romance, many a
honeymooner who stays here is dismayed to discover the resort is over-

Disney’s Pop Century Resort
$–$$
Walt Disney World
Flower power, the Rubik’s Cube, and Play-Doh still rule supreme at the Pop
Century Resort. Nestled behind the Caribbean Resort, near Disney’s Wide
World of Sports, this newest Disney value property is still a work in
progress; only one section of the resort was open at press time. The remain-
der will open in phases over the next few years. This value (Disney’s word
for budget) resort is perhaps the most fun for adults, who will enjoy the
many reminders of their past, including a bowling-alley–shaped pool and a
three-story-tall Big Wheel. The all-too-small rooms are in buildings deco-
rated with pop-culture references from the last four decades and mirror
those at the All-Star Resorts in most every way. Forget frills — there aren’t
any; though, because it’s new, there’s been no wear and tear yet. Amenities
include a brightly decorated food court, three pools, and a video arcade.

Disney’s Port Orleans Resort
$$–$$$
Walt Disney World
Port Orleans has the best location, the best landscaping, and the coziest
atmosphere of the resorts in this class. This Southern-style property is
really a combination of two distinct resorts: the French Quarter and
Riverside. Overall, this resort offers some romantic spots and is relatively
quiet, making it popular with couples; but the pools, playgrounds, and
array of activities make it a favorite for families as well. The Doubloon
Lagoon pool in the French Quarter is a family favorite, with a water slide
Chapter 9: Checking In at Orlando’s Best Hotels 111

that curves out of a sea serpent’s mouth before entering the recently refur-
bished pool. The rooms and bathrooms (equivalent to all rooms at Disney’s
moderate resorts) are somewhat of a tight fit for four (the Alligator Bayou
rooms have a trundle bed, allowing for an extra person), but the vanity
areas now have privacy curtains. Boatwright’s Dining Hall (see Chapter
10) serves New Orleans–style cuisine; there’s also a lively food court. Port
Orleans is just east of Epcot and Disney–MGM Studios. Note: All 1,080
rooms in the French Quarter side had a top-to-bottom refurbishment in
2004, while the 2,048 rooms in Riverside were renovated in 2005.

Disney’s Saratoga Springs Resort & Spa
$$$–$$$$
Walt Disney World
This new Disney Vacation Club timeshare property opened its first sec-
tion in spring 2004, and rooms are rented out to tourists when owners
aren’t using them. It’s a good choice for large families or long stays. It’s
modeled after the luxurious upstate–New York country retreats of the late
1800s. The small, resort town of Saratoga Springs is evoked through lavish
gardens, Victorian architecture, a pool designed to look like natural
springs, and a country setting. The renowned spa offers a chance for relax-
ation and rejuvenation — both necessary after a day or two at the parks.
The accommodations include studios, and one-, two-, and three-bedroom
villas that have full kitchens or kitchenettes, coffeemakers, hair dryers,
and all the comforts of home. The property has a restaurant, a playground,
a video arcade, and four pools. The water taxi can transport you to
Downtown Disney for more evening entertainment options.

Marketplace). % 407-934-7639 or 407-827-7700. Fax: 407-827-7710. www.disney

Disney’s Wilderness Lodge
$$$–$$$$
Walt Disney World
Here’s an option for those who like the great outdoors but prefer the com-
forts of an indoor luxury resort. The geyser out back, the mammoth stone
hearth in the lobby, and bunk beds for the kids are just a few reasons this
resort is a favorite of families, though couples will find the surroundings
to their liking as well. The theme of the Great American Northwest is felt
throughout the lodge; its rustic architecture is patterned after a lodge at
Yellowstone National Park. The immense and winding swimming area cuts
through the rocky landscaping. The nearest park is the Magic Kingdom,
but because the resort is in a remote area, it can take some time to get
Part III: Settling into Orlando 
112

there. The main drawback is the difficulty in accessing other areas via the
Disney Transportation system.
The 181 units at the adjacent Villas at Disney’s Wilderness Lodge were
added in November 2000. This is another Disney Vacation Club timeshare
property that rents vacant rooms. It offers a more upscale mountain
retreat experience, and more room than accommodations at the
Wilderness Lodge, though the properties share a grand lobby, amenities,
and array of activities. Two notable restaurants, Artist Pointe (better for
adults) and the Whispering Canyon Café (great for families) are on-site.

Disney’s Yacht Club Resort
$$$$
Walt Disney World
The posh resort resembles a turn-of-the-20th-century New England yacht
club and is located on the 25-acre lake it shares with the Beach Club (listed
earlier in this chapter), which is a notch below the Yacht Club in sophis-
tication and atmosphere. This property is geared more toward adults and
families with older children, although young kids are still catered to
(you’re in Disney World, after all). The relatively large rooms sleep up to
five, and most rooms have patios or balconies, although some views are
of the asphalt parking lots. The resort has two restaurants, an extensive
swimming area that it shares with the Beach Club, a marina, and two tennis
courts. Epcot is a mere 10- to 15-minute walk from the front door, and the
BoardWalk, Swan, and Dolphin are just across the bridge.

Doubletree Guest Suites
$$–$$$
Lake Buena Vista/Official WDW Hotel
This seven-story, all-suite hotel is the best of the “official” hotels for large
families. Young patrons get their own check-in desk and theater. All accom-
modations are two-room suites that offer 643 square feet, and there’s
plenty of space for up to six to catch some zzzzs. You’ll also find an array
of recreational facilities, including a pool, two lighted tennis courts, and a
playground. Bus service to WDW parks is free and is available, for a fee, to
other parks. Downtown Disney is only minutes away.

Embassy Suites Lake Buena Vista
$$–$$$
Lake Buena Vista
Set near the end of Palm Parkway, just off Apopka-Vineland, this fun and
welcoming all-suite resort is close to all the action of Downtown Disney
and the surrounding area, yet still remains a quiet retreat. Each suite
sleeps five and includes separate living area (with a pullout sofa) and
sleeping quarters. The roomy accommodations make it a great choice for
families. Some of the other perks here include a complimentary cooked-to-
order breakfast and a daily manager’s reception.

Hard Rock Hotel
$$$–$$$$
International Drive Area/Universal Orlando
You can’t get rooms closer to CityWalk, Islands of Adventure, or Universal
Studios Florida than those at this California-mission–style hotel. This
Loews resort is on par with WDW’s Animal Kingdom Lodge, although its
rooms are 15 percent larger. Rooms come with two queens or one king and
feature all the standard amenities. The giant outdoor pool with sand beach
and underwater sound system is capable of bringing out the lounging
rocker in you. Unfortunately, although the rooms are relatively sound-
proof, a few notes seep through the walls, so ask for a room away from the
lobby area if quiet is important to you. Camp Li’l Rock will keep the kids
entertained while also offering Mom and Dad the chance for some time off.
Free transportation is available to the Universal and SeaWorld parks. As for
Disney, you’re on your own. The biggest perk: Guests get Universal Express
access to almost all rides and restaurants at Universal’s theme parks.

Close to the Disney parks, this Holiday Inn caters to kids in a big way. They
get their own check-in desk, can watch a movie at the theater in the lobby
area, or can have fun at Camp Holiday, the supervised activity center (one
of the best around). The hotel’s spacious KidSuites accommodate up to
six and have themes such as a space capsule, igloo, jail, and more.
Standard rooms are somewhat smaller and sleep four. All accommodations

Hyatt Regency Grand Cypress
$$$–$$$$
Lake Buena Vista
A resort destination in and of itself, this hotel is a great place to get away
from the Disney-crowd frenzy while still remaining close to the action. You
need deep pockets to stay here, but the reward is a palatial resort with
lush foliage. The hotel’s 18-story atrium has inner and outer glass eleva-
tors, which provide a unique thrill. The beautifully decorated rooms offer
the usual amenities. Recreational facilities are extensive and include golf
(45 holes), 12 tennis courts (5 lighted), two racquetball courts, a spa, an
adjoining equestrian center, and more. The property’s half-acre, 800,000-
gallon pool is one of the best in town, with caves, grottoes, and waterfalls.
There’s free transportation to WDW, but you’ll have to pay to go elsewhere.
If you’re in need of a break, the kids can play at the supervised child-care
facility, one of the better ones around.

JW Marriott Orlando, Grande Lakes
$$$–$$$$
International Drive Area/Universal Orlando
Opened in 2004, this Moorish-themed resort is situated on 500 acres of
lush, tropical landscaping at the new Grande Lakes development, just east
of SeaWorld. The guest rooms are on par with those in Disney’s moderate
class. Ask for a west-facing room for the best views. The smoke-free resort
is home to six restaurants and lounges and shares its recreational facili-
ties with the neighboring Ritz-Carlton (listed later), including a Greg
Norman–designed, par-72 golf course and a 40,000-square-foot spa. The
best feature is the fabulous landscaped 24,000-square-foot Lazy River pool,
which winds through rock formations and small waterfalls. I could do with-
out the $9-per-day self-parking fee, however.

Clean rooms, a heated outdoor pool, free continental breakfast, and free
shuttles to the Disney parks, all for under $50 a night, have made this prop-
erty a budget favorite. Some two-room suites are available at terrific prices
as well. There are two other Masters Inn properties in the Orlando theme-
park areas, but this one, nearest the Magic Kingdom, has received the ulti-
mate approval for a property trying to get in good with Mickey — an
official stamp of approval as a Disney “Good Neighbor” hotel.

Nickelodeon Family Suites Resort
$$–$$$
Lake Buena Vista
This all-suite property opened in July 1999 as the Holiday Inn Family Suites
Resort and does a fantastic job catering to families. A $20-million trans-
formation into an official Nickelodeon property in 2004 has made it even
more kid-friendly. The suites now feature Nick-decorated bedrooms for the
kids, complete with bunk or twin beds and a TV and video-game system.
The resort’s two pool areas are veritable water parks, with multilevel water
slides, flumes, climbing nets, and water jets. Poolside activities and recre-
ational options — including a small mini-golf course, playgrounds, and
sand play areas — are a hit with kids and parents alike. Nick After Dark,
an evening supervised activity program for kids ages 5 to 12, allows par-
ents to take a night off. Other kid-friendly amenities include wake-up calls
from Nick stars; daily Nick-character breakfasts; and live entertainment
featuring the only Orlando appearance of the popular Nickelodeon char-
acters outside of Universal Orlando. Most suites come with kitchenettes,

available. The upper floors facing Disney have great views of nightly fire-
works. The location, only minutes to Disney via a much-less-congested
road, can’t be beat.

Peabody Orlando
$$$$
International Drive Area/Universal Orlando
Welcome to the home of the famous — drum roll, maestro, s’il vous plaît —
Marching Mallards. These real ducks march through the lobby into their
luxury pool each morning at 11 a.m. (no kidding!), accompanied by — what
else? — John Philip Sousa’s marching music and a red-coated duck master,
and then back out at 5 p.m.
Chapter 9: Checking In at Orlando’s Best Hotels 119

The Peabody Hotel is located across from the Convention Center, in the
thick of all the action that I-Drive has to offer, including attractions, restau-
rants, and shopping. Guest rooms, even standard ones, are lavishly fur-
nished and come with numerous amenities. The Peabody offers not only
the best service in town but also some of the best hotel dining — look for
its signature restaurant, Dux, in Chapter 10. You’ll have to pay for trans-
portation to all the theme parks, so a rental car is a good idea if you want
to stay here.
The Peabody is scheduled to begin a major expansion, adding 750 rooms,
a full-service spa, additional meeting space, family-friendly elements
(which are lacking), and a parking garage. Completion is scheduled for late
2008 or early 2009.

Portofino Bay Hotel
$$$–$$$$
International Drive Area/Universal Orlando
Another Loews property, this one really delivers for those with deep pock-
ets. Inspired by a comment from director Steven Spielberg, who at the time
was working on a ride at Islands of Adventure, it offers six
restaurants/lounges, a spa, a beach pool with a fort and water slide, and a
fitness center in a package that’s convincingly designed to look like the
Mediterranean seaside village of Portofino, Italy. The accommodations
offer four-poster beds with cloud-soft pillows, and bathrooms outfitted
with marble tubs and tiled foyers. Rooms are state-of-the-art “smart
rooms” that provide security, adjust room temperature, and report mal-
functions as they occur. The hotel offers free transportation to Universal’s
and SeaWorld’s parks, but (they’re not stupid!) forget the free ride to the
Disney ones. Best feature: Guests get Universal Express access to almost
all rides at Universal’s theme parks. Note: Getting around this sizeable
resort involves having to maneuver numerous stairs.

Renaissance Orlando Resort at SeaWorld
$$–$$$$
International Drive Area/Universal Orlando
Large rooms, good service, and a luxurious interior (a ten-story atrium
houses lush gardens, cascading waterfalls, a koi pond, and an elegant free-
flight aviary) are this hotel’s calling cards. Its most valuable feature, how-
ever, is a location that’s perfect if you’re going to Universal, SeaWorld (it’s
right across the street), and, to a lesser degree, the second-tier I-Drive

attractions. The beautifully decorated rooms are oversized, allowing for
plenty of space to spread out and relax. The Renaissance has four lighted
tennis courts; a health club, spa, and sauna (currently undergoing an
extensive expansion); and a completely renovated pool area. It also boasts
two restaurants and arguably the best Sunday brunch in Orlando.
Transportation to the parks is available for a fee, though most guests can
easily walk to SeaWorld.

Reunion Resort & Club
$$$$
Kissimmee
One of the newest luxury resorts to open its gates, the posh but unpre-
tentious Reunion is a resort community still in its early phases of devel-
opment (with a completion date set years into the future). Currently
operational are a few groups of villas and vacation homes, as well as an
extensive on-site water park (in addition to other resort pools located
throughout the property), a tennis complex, stables, retailers, restaurant,
and a spa. The top-of-the-line accommodations are great for families or
friends traveling together, and feature full kitchens, spacious bathrooms,
and almost every amenity you could ask for. Three championship golf
courses, designed by such famous names as Watson and Nicklaus, are cur-
rently operational. A kids’ program offering a variety of supervised activ-
ities allows parents time to tee off at the golf course or relax at the spa.
The staff is among the best I’ve ever encountered.

Ritz-Carlton Orlando, Grande Lakes
$$$–$$$$
International Drive Area/Universal Orlando
Part of the lush 500-acre Grande Lakes Resort complex, this luxury resort —
styled like an Italian palazzo — opened in 2004. All the spacious guest
rooms feature dual private balconies, flat-screen TVs, and oversized
marble bathrooms with separate bathtub and shower. For the ultimate
experience, upgrade to the Club Level to receive butler service, Bulgari
bath amenities, an in-room DVD/VCR/CD player, and free snacks. Seven
restaurants and lounges are on-site, and the Ritz shares some recreational
amenities with the neighboring JW Marriott (see the review earlier),
including a Greg Norman–designed golf course and a 40,000-square-foot
spa. The resort’s Ritz Kids program includes a children’s pool and play-
ground, separate check-in area, and on-site nanny service (for a fee). Kid
suites offer equally lavish accommodations especially designed for

Royal Pacific Resort
$$$–$$$$
International Drive Area/Universal Orlando
The newest Universal resort sports an attractive Polynesian theme that’s
the best of the bunch. Highlights of the property include an exquisite
orchid garden, five restaurants and lounges (one run by famed chef Emeril
Lagasse), and a lagoon-style pool — the largest in Orlando. The guest
rooms’ plain furnishings fall short of comparable Disney resorts, and the
rooms are smaller than those at Universal’s other hotels but are comfort-
able for four. The Royal Pacific isn’t cheap, but it offers good value for the
money, especially when you factor in the hotel’s free transport to
Universal’s theme parks, where guests get Universal Express access to
almost all rides. One thing I could do without: The outrageous $10 self-
parking charge, especially because the parking lot is a hike from the hotel.

Seralago Hotel & Suites Maingate East
$–$$
Kissimmee
Location (it’s just down the road from Disney) and price are just some of
the perks here. This newly revamped hotel (formerly the Holiday Inn &
Suites Maingate East) sports all new colors and a bright new look, but it
still features the themed Kid’s Suites with separate sleeping areas for your
children, as well as standard rooms and regular two-room suites. The
rooms provide a reasonable amount of space for a family of five, with the
two-room unit sleeping up to eight. The place features numerous recre-
ational activities, from swimming to tennis, and the hotel’s movie theater
shows free family films nightly. There’s also a family-friendly food court,
and kids 12 and younger eat free (two kids per paying adult) in the hotel’s
cafe.

Lake Buena Vista
A Summerfield Suites in a previous life, this recent addition to the
Staybridge Suites chain is located just off Apopka–Vineland, close to the
action of Downtown Disney and the theme parks, as well as many restau-
rants. An excellent choice for families, this hotel’s room sizes, price, and
friendly staff are three more good reasons to stay here. Featured are one-
and two-bedroom suites (which can sleep up to eight), all with full kitchens
(some two-bedroom suites have two bathrooms). The suites have large,
comfortable, separate living areas when compared to other all-suite hotels.
A continental breakfast is included and a complimentary grocery-shop-

Downtown Orlando
Located in Thornton Park, this inn near scenic Lake Eola is an option if
you want to stay near the downtown museums but not in a motel or hotel.
Its four buildings date to the early 1900s. All units (studios to suites)
include private bathrooms and entrances; some have garden tubs, bal-
conies, kitchenettes, and four-poster beds. The two-bedroom, two-bath-
room Key Lime Cottage ($209) sleeps four and has a full kitchen. Rates
include a continental breakfast. The B&B doesn’t offer transportation to
the parks, which means a rental car is a necessity for most guests. Note:

The Villas of Grand Cypress Golf Resort
$$$–$$$$
Lake Buena Vista
Meet the sister of the Hyatt Regency Grand Cypress (listed earlier in this
chapter). The one- to four-bedroom villas, a short drive from the larger
hotel, offer privacy not found in most resorts. You can play 45 holes of golf
on Jack Nicklaus–designed courses or take lessons at the golf academy.
The horse crowd loves the top-of-the-line equestrian center; riding lessons
and packages are available. (See Chapter 27 for more information on
riding.) The Mediterranean-style villas, which range from junior suites to
four-bedroom affairs, have Roman tubs and patios or balconies. Larger

villas have full kitchens. There’s free shuttle service to the resort’s recre-
ational facilities and to the WDW parks. Unlike its sister Hyatt property,
this resort caters primarily to adults, but Villa guests with kids can use the
Hyatt’s child care, as well as the recreational facilities.

Walt Disney World Dolphin
$$$–$$$$
Walt Disney World/Official WDW Hotel
What a wonderful place for folks a) not on a budget, b) wanting to be close
to Epcot and Disney–MGM Studios, and c) desperate to stay in a place that
answers the question: What kind of gingerbread house would Dali create
if he were an architect? You can’t miss the massive, 56-foot twin dolphin
statues on the roof of this resort. When you’re inside the lobby, you’ll
encounter prints from the likes of Matisse and Picasso.
Rooms offer views of the grounds and parts of WDW and were upgraded
in 2004. The resort shares its extensive recreational facilities, including a
grotto pool with waterfalls, water slide, and whirlpools, as well as a Body
by Jake health club and luxurious Mandara Spa, with its sister hotel the
Walt Disney World Swan (listed below). The hotel offers free transporta-
tion to the WDW parks, but you have to pay for a ride to the others.
Though it’s essentially treated as a Disney hotel, and guests get many of
the same privileges as a Disney resort guest, this one is actually owned
and operated by Starwood hotels as a Westin Resort. As a result, you may
find discounts for this one that wouldn’t otherwise be available at Disney-
owned hotels.

statues and seashell fountains. The Swan and Dolphin hotels are con-
nected by a canopied walkway and share recreational facilities, including
four pools and four lighted tennis courts. The luxurious rooms are a shade
smaller than those in the Dolphin but have Nintendo games (for a fee) and
Westin’s signature “Heavenly Bed” (firm mattress, down comforter, blan-
ket, and five pillows). The resort underwent a major renovation in 2003 by

Westin Grand Bohemian
$$–$$$$
Downtown Orlando
The Grand Bohemian has an early-20th–century Euro-Bohemian look. It
caters almost exclusively to either business or romance crowds, which
means you’ll find few children on the premises. Its rooms feature an Art
Deco motif, with plenty of chrome, reds, purples, and mirrors. The
“Heavenly Beds” (firm mattresses, down comforters, blankets, and five pil-
lows) are among the best in Orlando. The upper floors on the east side
overlook the pool; the north side faces downtown. The hotel, which is
smoke-free, has more than 100 pieces of 19th- and 20th-century American
fine art. This isn’t the most convenient hotel if your vacation is solely cen-
tered on the parks, but it is far enough away if you need a break from all
the manic energy of screaming kids and adults in costume. The wonderful
downtown nightlife is right outside the front door.

Dining and Snacking 
in Orlando
In This Chapter
 Sampling Orlando’s eateries
 Finding dining options for the budget-conscious
 Exploring the best dining in Orlando
 Sharing a meal with the Mouse and other characters
W
ith more than 5,000 restaurants in the Orlando area, there’s cer-
tainly no lack of dining choices. New restaurants are opening all
the time, with just as many stale ones closing. Most are surprisingly
decent (Orlando is, after all, a city where food tends to be viewed merely
as fuel); though some of the more recent entries on the dining scene are
definitely making their mark.
In this chapter, I offer general pointers about dining in the land of Diz,
explain the ins and outs of making reservations, provide detailed reviews
of the city’s best restaurants, and give you the lowdown on Orlando’s
most famous meal experience: character dining.
Getting the Dish on the Local Scene
Few people come to Orlando with fine dining on the mind, though it’s a
lot easier to find nowadays than it used to be. The city has its fair share
of fancier spots that can compete with the best in the country (Disney’s
Victoria & Albert, Emeril Lagasse’s two Universal Orlando restaurants,
and Manuel’s on the 28th), but most visitors tend to dine at the chains,
which are seemingly everywhere you turn, or inside the theme parks,
where the food doesn’t often astound, but the atmosphere is right. In
this city, the emphasis tends to be more on the experience and the
theme than it is on the food (which, most restaurant execs appear to
reason, is used to generate enough kick to get through the attractions
without your tank getting empty).

With only a very few exceptions, if you want truly first-class cuisine with-
out having to take out a second mortgage, you have to get out of the
theme-park zones. Restaurants catering to locals (especially in the Dr.
Philips area and Winter Park, but also in downtown Orlando) usually
offer excellent food and a sophisticated atmosphere at prices far less
daunting than inside the major tourist zones, with a small handful of
others located in downtown Orlando as well. I review a number of excel-
lent local restaurants in this chapter.
Most Orlando restaurants go out of their way to cater to kids, offering
children’s menus, diversions such as crayons at the table, high chairs,
and so on. The high kid-quotient generally means a higher volume level
and a more jovial atmosphere. Adults seeking a quiet, sophisticated, or
romantic night out do have options, however, and I note restaurants that
offer some respite from the kids on the “Good for Grown-ups” list found
on this book’s tear-out Cheat Sheet.
Orlando’s own tend to dine early (as do most visitors with kids). For a
more leisurely and relaxed meal, try to eat dinner after 8:30 p.m., but
don’t wait too late — except for a few fast-food joints, many restaurants
close between 10 and 11 p.m.
For more information on the types of Orlando cuisine, see Chapter 2.
Dressing down
Didn’t pack the tux this time around, or just not a fan of dressing for
dinner? The good news is that the city’s casual attitude generally
extends to most of its restaurants, so you can leave the penguin suits
and long gowns at home. At the theme parks, nobody will look at you
twice if you walk into an otherwise formal atmosphere in shorts and a 
T-shirt. That said, a few high-end restaurants do require formal or semi-
formal attire; if a coat and tie are called for at a restaurant, I note it in the
restaurant reviews in this chapter.
Lighting up
If you’re a smoker, don’t plan on lighting up over dinner. Effective July 1,
2003, a state constitutional amendment banned smoking in Florida’s
public workplaces, including all restaurants and bars that serve food.
Stand-alone bars that serve virtually no food are exempt, and so are des-
ignated smoking rooms in hotels and motels, but they’re becoming fewer
and farther between.
Making reservations
Reserving a table is a wise idea for most of Orlando’s finest restaurants,
but in most cases, you can wait to make same-day reservations. You’ll
find, of course, some exceptions to this rule, and I note them in the
appropriate restaurant reviews.
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in Orlando 129

Advanced Dining Reservations (previously known as Priority Seating)
is the only option available at most Disney properties. This practice is
Mickey’s way of saying that you get the next available table after you
arrive (at your prearranged arrival time). Understand, however, that
you’ll probably still have to wait 10 to 15 minutes after you get to the
restaurant before actually being seated. I recommend that you always
call as far ahead as possible to make an Advanced Dining Reservation
(in most cases, you’re able to make arrangements 180 days out). If you
try walking in off the street to find a table, you may not get one before
your stomach starts growling at you (if you get one at all). Call % 407-
939-3463 to stake a claim to a table at Mickey’s place. If you’re staying 
at a WDW resort, you can make Advanced Dining Reservations at the
hotel’s Guest Relations desk, with the concierge, or dial % 55 from your
room phone and arrange it yourself.
Don’t even think of showing up for a Disney character meal (see “Dining
with Disney Characters” at the end of this chapter) without an Advanced
Dining Reservation made far in advance if you want to ensure you get a
table. In years past, some of the meals took Advanced Dining Reservations
up to two years ahead of time — and many booked up within minutes.
Now the window of time has been reduced to only 180 days, and it is
essential that you begin calling the moment the phone lines open (7 a.m.)
as you will be one of thousands vying for a seat at the character meals.
You can also make Advanced Dining Reservations after you’re inside 
the Disney parks — best done immediately upon your arrival. At Epcot,
make reservations at the Worldkey interactive terminals at Guest
Relations in Innoventions East, at Worldkey Information Service satel-
lites located on the main concourse to the World Showcase, and at
Germany in the World Showcase, or at the restaurants themselves. In 
the Magic Kingdom, you can sign up at Guest Relations inside City Hall
or at the restaurants. For Disney–MGM Studios, reserve a table via Guest
Relations just inside the entrance or at the restaurants. At Animal
Kingdom, reserve at Guest Relations near the entrance.
Worried WDW can’t entertain your vegetarian taste buds? Looking for
kosher food? Disney can usually handle those diets and other special
ones (for people who need fat-free or sugar-free meals, or for folks who
have allergies or are lactose intolerant, for example), as long as guests
give Disney advance notice — usually no more than 24 hours. It’s a good
idea to discuss these requirements when you make your Advanced
Dining Reservation arrangements. Select counter-service eateries now
offer specialty food items on their menu (check your park map for
details on which ones and what they offer). If you’re not staying at WDW,
call % 407-939-3463.
Tipping and taxes in Orlando
Sales tax on restaurant meals and drinks ranges from 6.5 to 7 percent
throughout the Orlando area. (These taxes don’t apply to groceries.) In
Part III: Settling into Orlando 
130

addition, the standard tip in full-service restaurants is 15 percent, and a
12 percent tip is usually warranted at a buffet where a server brings
your drinks, fetches condiments, and cleans the table. If you have a pre-
dinner drink, leave a small tip to reward the server.
Make sure that you carefully look over your check before coughing up a
tip because some restaurants have started automatically tacking a gratu-
ity onto your bill, especially for larger groups. There’s no sense doubling
a tip for routine service.
Trimming the Fat from Your Dining Budget
If you’re staying in the parks until closing, you may find it more conven-
ient to eat there, but you’ll probably pay an average of 25 percent more
than in the outside world. (Dinner for two at a sit-down restaurant in
WDW, including tax and tip, can cost $50 or more — sometimes, a lot
more especially if you add in appetizers, desserts, and drinks.) If you
don’t mind ditching Mickey every now and again, you can substantially
decrease your eating expenses.
Here are a few suggestions to get the most out of your dining dollars:
 I won’t list all of them, but if you spend any time on International
Drive or U.S. 192/Irlo Bronson Memorial Highway between
Kissimmee and Disney, you’ll see all sorts of billboards peddling 
all-you-can-eat breakfast buffets at chain restaurants for $4 to $7. 
A buffet is a great way to fuel up early for the day and skip, or at
least lighten up on, lunch. The drawback: You lose valuable time
when the parks are less crowded.
 Make sure you pick up all the free magazines and ad books that 
you see everywhere in Orlando hotels, tourist information centers,
most convenience stores, newspaper racks, highway rest areas,
and so on. These publications include coupons good for a second
meal free, discount prices on entrees, or a free dessert, beverage,
or appetizer with a meal. Also, watch for ads from restaurants that
offer kids-eat-free specials or discounts for early birds.
 Inexpensive (by now you know that’s a relative term) kids’ menus
(usually $8 and under with a drink) are common at most of Orlando’s
moderately priced and family-style restaurants. Many also offer
place mats with mazes or pictures to color.
 If you enjoy a cocktail before dinner, don’t ignore places with happy-
hour specials, including two-for-one drinks — some at bargain 
rates — usually from 4 to 7 p.m. Again, you can find listings in the
free area guides in hotel lobbies and other places throughout Orlando.
 If your vacation won’t be complete without trying at least one of
the sit-down theme-park restaurants, consider scheduling your
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in Orlando 131

meal at lunch instead of dinner, when prices are almost always sig-
nificantly cheaper.
 If you’re on a tight budget and your room has a kitchen, or at least
a spot to sit and grab a bite, consider dining in a night or two and
saving a few bucks. Area grocers, many with delis that turn out
ready-to-eat treats, include Albertson’s, 7524 Dr. Phillips Blvd., 
(% 407-352-1552; www.albertsons.com) and Gooding’s at the
Crossroads shopping center in Lake Buena Vista, 12521 Hwy. 535/
Apopka–Vineland Ave. (% 407-827-1200; www.goodings.com),
with another location at 8255 International Dr. (% 407-352-4215).
Gooding’s also offers a delivery service — visit the Web site or call
for details. You can find even more options in the Orlando Yellow
Pages under “Grocers.”
 Purchase discounted gift certificates to many Universal Orlando/
International Drive–area restaurants from Clear Channel of
Orlando’s Dining Deals Web site (http://halfprice.cc
orlando.com). The selection varies per radio station per week, 
but the average deal is a $50 certificate for $25. You can also bid 
to win dining certificates to a variety of Orlando-area restaurants
via IBidUSA (www.ibidusa.com) and Restaurant.com (www.
restaurant.com). Bids of $3 to $5 have been known to win $25 
gift certificates at some of the city’s best restaurants.
Part III: Settling into Orlando 
132
Cutting food costs inside WDW
Eating at Disney parks can set you back more than a few bucks. For example, a 20-
ounce bottle of cola or spring water is $2.50 or more. To save money, buy a bottle (or
six-pack) of water from a local grocery costing far less (freeze it the night before to
keep it really cold), and take it with you to the park, refilling it at water fountains
throughout the day. Also, in the Animal Kingdom, you can belly up to the bar at the
Rainforest Café, order a soda for $2.50, and get a free glass of water. If you’re eating
lunch, the average price per person is barely under $10 if you eat at the counter-
service–style fast-food areas, but it’s much less expensive than at the full-service
eateries. One of the cheapest entrees at the parks is a smoked turkey drumstick for
$4.75 (and they’re huge!). You also can get a pineapple float for around $2.75.
Most of the resorts at Disney offer a refillable mug, which is good for refills there for the
duration of your WDW visit (the mugs must be used at the resort in which they were
purchased). The cost for the glass in most of the resorts is $12. At most resorts, the refills
are free (with a list of select beverages), although a few of them charge $1. The price may
seem steep, but if you consider that most sodas cost around $2 or more individually and
you take into account how much you’d drink during your stay, it’s actually a good deal.
Some of Disney’s water parks have refillable glasses, but refills are limited to the day
you’re in the park. For more information, call Disney at % 407-934-7639.

Orlando’s Best Restaurants
In this section, I review, in alphabetical order, what I think are some of
Orlando’s best restaurants. I also throw in some handy indexes at the
end of the chapter to help you narrow your choices by category.
Because you may spend a lot of time in the Walt Disney World area, I’ve
given special attention to choices there. Don’t worry, though. I haven’t
forgotten to toss in plenty of worthwhile restaurants outside of Disney’s
domain — including a handful of Universal Orlando’s latest entries 
(you can find in-park dining options for the Universal theme parks in
Chapters 18 and 19) and some of the favorites elsewhere around town.
Sit-down restaurants in the WDW theme parks (not their resorts) require
admission, with one exception: the Rainforest Café at Animal Kingdom.
Unless you’re a Disney resort guest, all of the Disney theme-park restau-
rants will also set you back $10 in parking fees ($10 also for Universal
Orlando’s CityWalk restaurants, unless you arrive after 6 p.m., when park-
ing becomes free; parking fees for Universal Orlando resort restaurants
vary). And keep in mind, too, alcohol isn’t served in Magic Kingdom
restaurants, but liquor is served at Animal Kingdom, Epcot, and
Disney–MGM Studios restaurants, and elsewhere in the Disney domain, as
well as at the other major theme parks.
Dining in Orlando constitutes your biggest vacation expenditure. To
make it easy for you to recognize expensive versus moderately priced
restaurants, each of the following entries includes one or more $ sym-
bols, based upon the average price of an adult dinner entree and one
nonalcoholic drink. For the meaning behind the dollar symbols, see
Table 10-1.

But the champagne Sunday brunch served in the huge atrium of the

An extensive menu includes items such as a Belgian endive salad in a light,
Dijon mustard dressing with gorgonzola cheese and toasted walnuts;
spaghetti with Maine lobster and cherry tomatoes in a tomato bisque; and
veal chops with sautéed mushrooms, potatoes, and spinach. The main
dining room overlooks the waters along the piazza of the hotel, itself a
beautiful and romantic setting. A table on the patio, if timed right, may
allow you to enjoy the music of the strolling musicians performing just
below along the piazza. Disappointingly, some of the servers and staff are
a bit aloof.

Sink into an upholstered booth or belly up to a stool at the counter of this
restaurant with décor straight out of the ’50s. Gleaming chrome, black-and-
white tile, and red leather create a vision of yesterday’s roadside diners in
this informal and friendly gathering place. Dig into hearty portions of com-
fort foods, such as chicken pot pie, roast pork with apples, or a ham-and-
cheese sandwich on a baguette. Health foods and vegetarian specials are
also available.
Although this is a diner-style restaurant and there is a kids’ menu, it’s not
a good spot to take young children because it’s located at the Peabody, a
very upscale hotel.

Boatwright’s Dining Hall
$–$$
Walt Disney World Resorts
NEW ORLEANS
A family atmosphere (lively and noisy), good food (by Disney standards),
and reasonable prices (ditto) make Boatwright’s a hit with Port Orleans
Resort guests. Most entrees have a Cajun/Creole spin. The jambalaya is
sans seafood, but it’s filled with veggies, rice, chicken, and sausage — and
it’s got a kick. Vegetarians will appreciate the vegetable medley or four-
cheese ravioli; other entrees include bayou seafood stew, bourbon glazed
chicken, glazed pork ribs, and a hearty pot roast. Boatwright’s is modeled
after a 19th-century boat factory, complete with the wooden hull of a
Louisiana fishing boat suspended from its lofty, beamed ceiling. Kids are
drawn to the wooden toolboxes on every table; each contains a saltshaker
that doubles as a level, a wood-clamp sugar dispenser, a pepper-grinder-
cum-ruler, shop rags (to be used as napkins), and a little metal pail of
crayons.

Bob Marley — A Tribute to Freedom
$–$$
Universal Orlando
CARIBBEAN
This combination club and restaurant is housed in a replica of the late
singer’s home in Kingston, Jamaica, complete with red-tile roof and green
shutters. Live reggae plays nightly, but the decibel level doesn’t get as high
as at Jimmy Buffett’s Margaritaville (reviewed later in this chapter). The
small menu has modestly priced fare, including a jerk tilapia sandwich
served on coca bread with yucca fries or a seafood salad of conch, shrimp,
and tilapia, with citrus vinaigrette and served in a red tortilla bowl. Of
course, most folks don’t leave without sipping a Red Stripe — Jamaica’s
beer of champions.

Follow your nose to the wood-burning grill and open kitchen at this
African-influenced eatery inside Disney’s Animal Kingdom Lodge. The
large wood tables remain in the shape of the tree trunks and colorful ban-
ners hang from the thatched roof. The selection and variety here are vast
and often unique. Adventurous diners can expect such treats as Moroccan
seafood salad (mussels, scallops, shrimp, and couscous) and curried-
coconut, seafood stew, alongside more familiar favorites at the restaurant’s
breakfast and dinner buffets. Kids have their own station serving up
chicken, pasta, and mac ’n’ cheese. Chefs are on hand behind the open

Bubbalou’s Bodacious BBQ
$–$$
International Drive Area
AMERICAN
You can smell the hickory smoke emerging from the chimney of this restau-
rant for blocks. This is, hands down, some of the best barbecue you’ll find
anywhere. And, if nothing else, you have to love the name. The atmosphere
is extremely informal, but you have to watch the sauces. Even the mild
may be too hot for tender palates; the killer sauce comes with a three-
alarm warning — you may not be able to taste anything else for days. If
you can eat the night or day away, go for the Big-Big Pig platter (beef, sliced
pork, and turkey with fixins). And it wouldn’t be a barbecue without plenty
of brew on hand.

INTERNATIONAL
This colorful eatery with the flair of an artist’s loft features treats from
Latin America, Asia, the Caribbean, the Middle East, and the United States.
It’s an ideal spot for sampling different dishes; every order comes in a
miniature size. The roasted pears on pecan crisps — topped with Spanish
bleu cheese and a balsamic reduction — are a must. Chocolate fiends will
not want to pass up the dessert of handmade truffles — truly to die for.
Guests frequently see an artist bringing a canvas to life. You can also buy
wine by the glass or bottle. Note: Although, individual tapas are relatively
inexpensive, ordering several tapas and drinks can easily turn this meal
into a $$$ restaurant.

Christini’s
$$–$$$
Dr. Phillips Area
ITALIAN
The numerous awards and trophies on the walls attest to restaurateur
Chris Christini’s high standard of service. The fact that he’s been around
since 1984 shows he’s a survivor. Count on his restaurant for a possible
peek at show-biz celebrities from down the road at Disney–MGM and
Universal. A tender broiled veal chop seasoned with sage and served with
applesauce is one of the headliners. Another good choice is the pan-seared
Chilean sea bass over shrimp-and-lobster risotto. The food is quite good,
and the wine list is definitely a winner. The atmosphere is somewhat
formal, making it a good spot for a romantic night out.

salmon with fennel ravioli and Swiss chard. The old-world–style dining

Seafood rules at this very popular restaurant, which offers fabulous views
of the Living Seas aquarium and a dash of classical music to help set a

tatsoi, and a honey-soy glaze and seared sterling salmon with mixed
greens, roasted potatoes, and pancetta garlic vinaigrette, with a decent
selection of landlubber fare as well. The Reef serves wine by the glass.

Think posh with a capital P — that’s what comes to mind when you slip
inside these walls. The restaurant’s name honors the mallards that splash
all day in the marble fountains in the Peabody’s grandly formal lobby.
(Staffers assure us that birds of the quacking variety will never appear on
the menu.) Candlelit tables surround a large chandelier, and textured gold
walls are hung with watercolors of the various duck species. Its eclectic
menu changes with the seasons. Possibilities include a tender veal chop
roasted medium rare with an artichoke-basil fricassee and garlic au jus; or
steamed red snapper in tomato fricassee and fennel. Choose a wine from
one of the best wine lists in the city. The service is impeccable; for most
people, however, the prices make Dux a choice only for special nights or
expense-account meals.

Earl of Sandwich
$
Downtown Disney
AMERICAN
In the spring of 2004, the Earl of Sandwich (the famous edible was invented
by said earl in 1762 when he was too busy playing cards to eat a real meal)
made its debut in Downtown Disney. It’s an alliance between Robert Earl,
founder and CEO of Planet Hollywood, and John Montagu, the real 11th
Earl of Sandwich. The eatery offers a great selection of hot and cold deli
sandwiches, wraps, and salads for those looking for a light meal at a very
decent price. It’s one of the best dining deals at Disney.

Emeril’s Orlando
$$–$$$
Universal Orlando
NEW ORLEANS
The Florida home of culinary genius Emeril Lagasse, star of Emeril Live on
cable TV’s Food Network (and, therefore, rarely on the premises), offers a
feast for both the eyes and mouth. This two-story restaurant resembles
an old warehouse, albeit one with pricey art on its walls. The second floor
has a 12,000-bottle wine gallery. If you want a show, I highly recommend
trying to get one of the eight counter seats where you can watch the chefs
working their Creole-cuisine magic, but to get one, you’ll need to make
reservations excruciatingly early. (Reserve at least six weeks in advance.)
Best bets include the Texas redfish (an extremely moist white fish with
roasted pecan-vegetable relish and meunière sauce) and a grilled-and-
roasted half chicken served with rice pilaf. Though jackets are recom-
mended for gents at dinner, you’ll find a lot of diners, fresh out of the
Universal theme parks, far less dressy.
Emeril’s lunch menu is cheaper but has many of the same items as the one
at dinner. It’s also easier to get a reservation, and the dress code is more
casual.

woks or on wood-burning grills. The Polynesian- and Asian-influenced
menu offers temptations such as macadamia-crusted Atlantic salmon with

If you yearn to go back to a time when life was simpler, this is the place for
you. The décor is right out of the television sitcoms, and servers deliver
comfort foods, including meatloaf, fried chicken, and pot roast. The food
isn’t quite the way Mom used to make it, but the place offers enough fun
that you may love it anyway. Black-and-white TVs air shows such as Topper
and My Little Margie as servers zap you back to the days when you had to
finish your vegetables if you wanted dessert. Mom (aka, your server) may
very well scold you if put your elbows on the table or don’t clean your
plate. Desserts like s’mores and sundaes top off the menu, and there’s even
a neat selection of specialty drinks.

rum concoction he invented and, according to legend, once downed 16 at
one sitting! The interior of Hemingway’s has a Key West air, and the walls
are adorned with several sepia photographs of the famous author and his

Inside, this re-creation of the restaurant where Hollywood’s stars gathered

win an Academy Award, but the restaurant does have a respectable pan-
seared black grouper with green beans al dente and mustard-crusted rack

Downtown Disney
AMERICAN
Inside this Louisiana clapboard building, you find hearty portions of down-
home Southern food served in an atmosphere literally pulsing with rhythm

and blues. Exceedingly crowded on days of big concerts, the music in the
nightclub next door is as much a draw as the food. Funky folk art with a
voodooish feel covers the rustic walls from floor to ceiling. The back patio
has seating and a nice view of the bay. Foodwise, the spicy Creole jamba-
laya (shrimp, chicken, ham, and andouille sausage) and pan-seared
voodoo shrimp are good bets. Sunday’s Gospel Brunch is a ton of foot-
stomping fun, with plenty of Southern favorites like chicken jambalaya,
cornbread, and BBQ chicken alongside breakfast staples including
omelets, sausage, and bacon. Brunch is the only time you can make reser-
vations, and it sells out fast, so make them early.

Jiko — The Cooking Place
$$–$$$
Walt Disney World Resorts
AFRICAN
The signature restaurant (translation: most expensive) at Disney’s Animal
Kingdom Lodge, Jiko has a show kitchen, sporting two wood-burning
ovens, and turns out a unique menu of international cuisine with African
overtones. Dishes, depending on the season, include Maylay shrimp curry,
pan-roasted monkfish, and lemon-cumin marinated ahi tuna. The wine list
features an extensive number of South African vintages. If you have an
adventurous palette, it’s well worth the trip.

Jimmy Buffett’s Margaritaville
$$
Universal Orlando
CARIBBEAN
The laid-back atmosphere may take you to paradise, but after the
Parrotheads have had enough to drink, the noise can make it hard to hear
your tablemates. You have your choice of three watering holes: the
Landshark Bar, the 12-Volt Bar, and the Volcano Bar, which comes com-
plete with a two-story, margarita-spewing mini mountain. Despite the
renowned Cheeseburgers in Paradise (yes, they’re on the menu at $9.95),
the food has Caribbean leanings. And although it isn’t contending for a
critic’s-choice award, it’s fairly tasty. Best bets include jerk chicken, jam-
balaya, and a Cuban meat loaf survival sandwich that’s a cheeseburger of
another kind. The Porch of Indecision offers the best spot for those with
kids along.
Watch your tab. At up to $8 a pop for margaritas (the mango ones are
best), the bill can climb to $50 or more for a routine lunch.

Tucked away in a shopping-center corner near Universal, you’ll find this
award-winning favorite, which offers traditional Chinese food done right.
Dishes are flavorful and excellently presented. Best of all, most entrees are
priced in the single digits. It’s been around for over 20 years, and for good
reason. Most nights, owner Tom Yuen works the floor greeting guests like

Le Cellier Steakhouse
$$–$$$
Epcot
STEAKS
You’ll feel welcome in this cozy steakhouse, which tends to be less
crowded — and less manic — than some of Epcot’s other restaurants. The
dining room resembles a wine cellar, where you’ll sit in tapestry-uphol-
stered chairs under vaulted stone arches, with lanterns lighting the room.
Although it doesn’t compete with some of the better outside-world steak-
and-chop houses, it has a surprisingly good selection of Midwest, corn-fed
beef in the usual cuts: filet, porterhouse, prime rib, rib-eye, and so on.

Les Chefs de France
$$–$$$
Epcot
FRENCH
Three famous French chefs — Paul Bocuse, Roger Vergé, and Gaston
LeNotre — concocted the menu at this restaurant, which serves
respectable fare that’s far better than the usual theme-park offerings. The
Art Nouveau interior is agleam with mirrors and candelabras, and etched-
glass and brass dividers create intimate dining areas. Dinner entrees
include Mediterranean seafood casserole (grouper, scallops, and shrimp
dusted with saffron and then allowed to swim in a mild garlic sauce) and
grilled tenderloin of beef with a Bordeaux wine sauce. The sauces tend to
be on the lighter side than at most traditional French restaurants. The
restaurant also offers a substantial wine list.

Liberty Tree Tavern
$$
Magic Kingdom
AMERICAN
This sit-down restaurant’s 18th-century colonial-pub atmosphere (period
music plays and the décor features antiques, oak-plank flooring, and a
huge fireplace filled with copper pots) and good service help make it one
of the better places to dine in the Magic Kingdom, but few will be com-
pelled to visit a second or third time. The cuisine is traditional American,
and vittles are basic: roast turkey, carved beef, and smoked pork with all
the trimmings. Lunch offers a la carte service, while dinner gives you a
character buffet (see “Dining with Disney Characters” later in this chap-
ter for more on the character meal). Note: Even though this place calls
itself a tavern, it does not serve alcohol.

Downtown Orlando
VIETNAMESE
Situated in the heart of a tiny Vietnamese neighborhood, this ethnic eatery
has been open since 1987 and thrives on regulars from the community.
The menu offers everything from appetizers to noodle dishes to stir-fries
that mix and match pork, beef, seafood, and vegetables. The combo plates
are a particularly good deal. Service and attention depend on the traffic.
Order food by number; if you need a description of a dish, you may need
to ask the manager, whose English is better than that of some of the
servers. Don’t miss the summer rolls with peanut sauce.

Epcot
ITALIAN
Sample southern Italian cuisine in a re-creation of Alfredo De Lelio’s
famous eatery in Rome, which includes some lovely wall murals and an
exhibition kitchen. It may be the World Showcase’s most popular restau-
rant (Advanced Dining Reservations are a must), but Alfredo’s servers can
be snooty and its pasta is very overpriced. Your best bets include the sig-
nature fettuccine Alfredo and the calamari in a white wine, garlic, and
tomato sauce served on fettuccine. The dining room noise level can be

The open-air cafe offers familiar favorites much like what you find in
Chinese restaurants located in mall food courts. Expect slightly above fast-

outdoor (though covered) seating is refreshing. You can buy Chinese beer

Downtown Orlando
INTERNATIONAL
Manuel’s is, literally, the pinnacle of elegance, situated in a posh,
panoramic enclave on the 28th floor of a downtown bank. Come here for
a stunning after-dark view of the sparkling, sprawling metropolis that
Orlando has become. To make sure you don’t miss out on the view, the
dining room has floor-to-ceiling windows. The best news: The food
matches the scenery. The dozen or more appetizers and entrees hit high
notes with duck, lamb, yellowfin tuna, lobster, and filet mignon. One pop-
ular dish is miso-marinated Chilean sea bass. The service is very profes-
sional, and the restaurant has a great wine list.

For a spot of romance and truly authentic flavor, head for Marrakesh. Of
all the World Showcase restaurants, this venue best typifies the interna-

scene for lavish North African dining, complete with belly dancers.
Marrakesh uses a long list of spices, including saffron, to enhance flavor-
ful specialties. Most entrees come with the national dish, couscous
(steamed semolina with veggies and sometimes other embellishments).
Good bets include a marinated shish kebob of lamb roasted in its own
juices, and a seafood medley.

Dine in a romantic setting, graced by lotus ponds filled with colorful koi
while you’re entertained by — get this — zither music. One of O-Town’s
favorite Chinese restaurants, and rated as one of the country’s best, the
Ming Court lets you rub elbows with more locals than tourists thanks to
innovative twists on traditional cuisine. The flavors are delicate and fresh.
Try the grilled filet mignon with Szechuan seasoning or the lightly battered
and deep-fried chicken breast with lemon-tangerine sauce. Portions are
sufficient, there’s a moderate wine list, and the service is excellent.

Nine Dragons shines in the décor department with carved rosewood pan-
eling and an amazing dragon-motif ceiling. But the food doesn’t match its
surroundings, and portions tend to be smaller than what most expect in a
Chinese restaurant. Main courses feature Mandarin, Shanghai, Cantonese,
and Szechuan cuisines. The dishes include spicy beef stir-fried with
squash in sha cha sauce, lightly breaded lemon chicken, and a casserole
of lobster, shrimp, and scallops sautéed with ginger and scallions. You can
order Chinese or California wines with your meal.

’Ohana

Walt Disney World Resorts

This restaurant is a hit in the fun department, but the decibel level can
climb pretty high. Servers will address you as “cousin” — ’Ohana means
family in Hawaiian. As your luau is prepared over an 18-foot fire pit, the
staff keeps your eyes and ears busy. A storyteller is followed by coconut
races in the center aisle, and then you can find out how to shake your
booty during a hula lesson. Soon after you’re seated, the feeding frenzy
begins in rapid succession. (Ask your waiter to slow down if the pace is
too fast.) Included in the set menu is a variety of skewers (think shish
kebob), including turkey, shrimp, steak, and pork with veggies, stir-fried

Downtown Disney and Animal Kingdom
AMERICAN
Set amid a jungle with tropical sounds of birds and waterfalls, this place is
a hit with kids! The food’s pretty respectable (with an extensive menu),
but it’s really the décor that makes this restaurant. As its name suggests,
entering the Rainforest Café is like walking into a jungle — lifelike silk
plants, chattering animatronic monkeys and elephants, the occasional rain
and thunder rumblings are all over. Fun dishes include Caribbean Coconut
Shrimp (with a sweet mango sauce), and Maya’s Mixed Grill (ribs, chicken
breast, and shrimp), but there are just too many to list. The bar stools
resemble zebras, giraffes, and other wild-and-crazy critters.
Don’t even think of showing up here without an Advanced Dining
Reservation, or you could end up waiting hours to get in.
Also be aware you have to walk right by the souvenir shop to dine, so keep
little heads turned to the left if you can.

Visitors from the U.K. flock to this spot for a taste of home. The Rose &

music, and some spirited servers. Dine on such traditional dishes as fish-

an English pie sampler (pork and cottage, and chicken and leek). On the
lighter side, bar food includes sausage rolls, Cornish pasties (meat pies),
and a Stilton cheese and fruit plate. You can order ale, lagers, and stouts
by the pint or (designated-driver alert!) half-yard. The pub has an ale
warmer to make sure Guinness is served at 55°F, just as its British guests
prefer. If you only want to grab a pint or a snack at the bar, you don’t need

San Angel Inn
$$
Epcot
MEXICAN
It’s always night at the San Angel, where you’ll eat at one of several roman-
tic candlelit tables located in a hacienda courtyard surrounded by dense
jungle foliage. The shadow of a crumbling Yucatán pyramid looms in the
distance, and you hear the sound of faraway birds and faint rumblings of
the volcano while you dine. The ambience of this restaurant, located inside
the Mexico Pavilion, is exotic, and the fare is traditional — that’s why you
won’t find nachos or Mexican pizza on the menu. Entrees include mole
poblano (chicken simmered with more than 20 spices and a hint of choco-
late) and filete motuleño (grilled tenderloin of beef served over black
beans, melted cheese, pepper strips, and plantains). Your drinking options
include Dos Equis beer and margaritas.

Sci-Fi Dine-In Theater
$$
Disney–MGM Studios
AMERICAN
Horror flicks too hokey to be scary play on the screen while you dine in a
replica of a 1950s Los Angeles drive-in movie emporium, complete with
tables ensconced in flashy, chrome-trimmed convertible cars. Fun-loving
carhops deliver free popcorn and your meal. Menu items have funny
names but are basics such as sandwiches, burgers, ribs, seafood, pasta,
and steaks. The unique atmosphere definitely keeps the crowds and the
kids coming.

Spoodles
$$
Walt Disney World Resorts
MEDITERRANEAN
Tapas, pizza, and pasta are the main items on the menu at this
Mediterranean-style restaurant, which features an open exhibition kitchen
and a lively atmosphere. The treats include Mediterranean dips with
toasted pita, marinated olives, and almonds with entrees including oak-
fired salmon with roasted vegetable stew or lemon chicken with toasted
couscous, baby spinach, and vine-ripened tomatoes. A respectable wine
list and table-side sangria presentations add something special to the
evening.
During the height of the summer, Spoodles gets crowded, and the wait can
be long, even with Advanced Dining Reservations, so this restaurant isn’t
a good choice for famished families coming straight from the parks, and it’s
really not a great choice for families with young kids along either.

Teppanyaki Dining Room
$$–$$$
Epcot
JAPANESE
If you’ve ever been to a Japanese steakhouse, then you know the drill:
Diners sit around the large grill-tables while the chefs expertly and quickly
dice, slice, stir-fry, and serve your food to your plate with amazing dex-
terity. Kids especially enjoy watching the chef wield a cleaver and other
utensils. Several parties are seated at teppanyaki tables, which make for
sociable dining, especially for single travelers looking for conversation.
Expect the entrees to have chicken, steak, scallops, lobsters, or a combi-
nation. Kirin beer, plum wine, and sake are served.
The adjoining Tempura Kiku counter-restaurant offers sushi, sashimi, and
tempura-battered shrimp and chicken.

Todd English’s bluezoo
$$–$$$$
Walt Disney World Resorts
SEAFOOD
Celebrity chef Todd English put down roots, in 2004, at the Walt Disney
World Dolphin with this restaurant, which serves innovative seafood in an
unusually vibrant upscale setting. The food is served with an artistic flair
almost as impressive as the décor. On the entree front, try the miso-glazed
Chilean sea bass or the catch of the day roasted on a rotisserie grill. A few
non-marine items round out the menu, but the emphasis here is on all
dishes aquatic. Shellfish lovers will enjoy the raw bar (just be sure to bring
your wallets!).

Victoria & Albert’s
$$$$
Walt Disney World Resorts
INTERNATIONAL
The setting is Victorian and a nostalgic reminder that dining out was once
a treat to be savored in an evening-filling, relaxed, and stylish manner. The
chef works wizardry with food from a diverse marketplace. This restau-
rant is the most memorable (and memorably expensive) in WDW. But if
money’s no object, and you’re serious about food and romance going hand
in hand, head here. The intimate dining room has exquisitely appointed
tables. The food is impeccable and presented with a flourish by an atten-
tive and professional staff. (Each table has servers named Victoria and
Albert.) The seven-course menu changes nightly. You may begin with
roasted duck with candy-striped and golden beets, followed by Monterey
abalone with lemon and baby spinach. Then, shrimp bisque may precede
an entree such as Australian Kobe-beef tenderloin. English Stilton served
with a poached pear sets up desserts such as vanilla-bean crème brûlée
and Kona chocolate soufflé. Dinners are 21⁄2 to 3-hour affairs, though the
later sitting can run longer. If you want to try the chef’s table experience
(you actually dine in the kitchen and watch them prepare your meal), be
sure to reserve it excruciatingly early (they begin taking Advanced Dining
Reservations 180 days in advance). Note: I don’t recommend this restau-
rant for children.

Wolfgang Puck Café
$$–$$$
Downtown Disney
AMERICAN
This restaurant’s sushi bar, an artistic copper-and-terrazzo masterpiece,
delivers some of the best sushi in Orlando. You can eat gourmet pizza, with
a thin crust and exotic toppings, on an outdoor patio or inside. Upstairs,
the main dining room presents a seasonally changing menu that may fea-
ture Szechuan beef and crimini satay with a spicy vegetable stir-fry or
pumpkin ravioli with sage, hazelnut butter, and parmesan. The lower level
can be noisy, making conversation difficult, and the downstairs wait for a
table is excruciatingly long. Puck’s also has a grab-and-go express restau-
rant that sells sandwiches, pizzas, desserts, and more.

Yachtsman Steakhouse
$$–$$$$
Walt Disney World Resorts
STEAKS
Regarded as one of Orlando’s top steak-and-chop houses, Yachtsman
Steakhouse is a good place to come if you love red meat. You can see the
cuts age in a glass-enclosed room, and the exhibition kitchen provides a
tantalizing glimpse of steaks, chops, and seafood being grilled over oak
and hickory. The décor includes knotty-pine beams, plank floors, and
leather-and-oak chairs. Steak options range from a 6-ounce filet to a 12-
ounce bourbon-marinated strip to a belly-busting 24-ounce T-bone. The
menu also includes salmon, chicken, and rack of lamb. The Steakhouse is
prone to crowds, but most folks say that it’s worth the wait.

Dining with Disney Characters
The opportunity to chow down with Mickey, Donald, Cinderella, and
many of the other major characters is the major dining experience in
Orlando. The 8-and-under crowd usually gets starry-eyed when charac-
ters show up to say howdy, sign autographs, pose for photos, and
encourage them to eat their broccoli. Character mealtime appearances
at Disney parks, attractions, and resorts are incredibly popular. As a
result, one-on-one interaction is somewhat brief, so be ready for that
Kodak moment or hope a WDW photographer captures it for you (at a
premium price).
Part III: Settling into Orlando 
158

You may not find a seat when you show up to a character appearance
unannounced, so call % 407-939-3463 to make Advanced Dinning
Reservations as far in advance as possible (these reservations don’t lock
down a table, but they give you the next available table after you arrive at
your appointed time). To take the guesswork out of figuring out how far
in advance (60 days? 90? 180?) you need to make an Advanced Dining
reservation, head online to the PS Planning Guide (www.pscalculator.
net). This unofficial site does a very good job of keeping up-to-date on all
the rules and reservation windows for every restaurant at Disney. But its
best feature is a calculator that allows you to punch in your desired reser-
vation date, and then tells you when the Advanced Dining Reservation
window for your chosen restaurant will be open. Best of all, this service 
is free.
The cost of catching characters
The prices for character meals are much the same, no matter where
you’re dining (with one exception — Cinderella’s Royal Table). Breakfast
(most serve it) runs $19 to $32 for adults and $11 to $22 for children 3 to
9; those that serve dinner charge $28 to $40 for adults and $13 to $25 for
kids. The prices vary a bit, though, from location to location. In general,
presentation at all the character meal listings here is high on the fun
front but middle-of-the-road when it comes to the food.
Character meals accept American Express, Diners Club, Discover,
MasterCard, Visa, and the Disney card. For more information on these
meals, check Disney’s Web site at www.disneyworld.com.
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in Orlando 159
Character dining at Universal Orlando 
and SeaWorld
Though it’s the recognized leader in the category, Disney doesn’t have a lock on char-
acter dining in Orlando. At Islands of Adventure, you can have breakfast with Spider-
Man, the Cat in the Hat, and other Marvel and Dr. Seuss characters Thursday through
Sunday from park opening to 10:30 a.m. at the Confisco Grille. The cost is $16 for adults
and $10 for children ages 3 to 9, plus tax and tip. Call % 407-224-4012 for the manda-
tory reservations.
Shamu and a group of his marine friends (Penny Penguin and Seamore the Sea Lion,
among others) welcome you at the Shamu & Crew Character Breakfast served from
8:45 to 10:15 a.m. at the park’s Seafire Inn. The cost is $15 for adults and $10 for chil-
dren ages 3 to 9 (children younger than 3 enter free, but must have a reservation). For
the mandatory reservations, call % 800-327-2420 or go to the park’s Web site at
www.seaworld.com.

The most characters money can buy
Although I mention specific characters here, be advised that WDW fre-
quently changes its lineups, so don’t promise the kids a specific charac-
ter or you may get burned. Also, keep in mind that you’ll have to add the
price of admission (and, if you aren’t a Disney resort guest, the $9 park-
ing fee) to meals that are served inside the theme parks. When bringing
children to these meals, remember that some of the very young ones
may actually end up scared of — and not delighted with — the larger-
than-life characters.
Akershus Royal Banquet Hall
Set inside a Disneyfied 14th-century castle, this eatery now features char-
acter dining at each meal. A smorgasbord of both hot and cold dishes
makes it a relative bargain for big eaters. Cured salmon with spicy mus-
tard; poached cod; braised lamb and cabbage; and venison stew along with
an array of Norwegian breads and cheeses, are among the choices at lunch
and dinner. The food is reasonably good, and the staff is friendly. Sweets
and sandwiches are available across the courtyard at the Kringla Bakeri
Og Kafe.

The whimsical Chef Mickey’s welcomes your favorite cartoon characters
twice a day: at buffet breakfasts (eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, fruit, and
other items) and dinners. (Entrees change daily and are joined by a salad
bar, soups, vegetables, and ice cream with toppings.) Mickey and various
pals are there to meet and mingle.

Cinderella’s Royal Table
This castle — the focal point of the park — is the setting for a character
breakfast buffet daily (a variety of breakfast favorites including scrambled
Part III: Settling into Orlando

eggs, bacon, Danish), and recently began serving a character lunch and
dinner (with a choice of appetizer, entree, salad, and dessert from a fixed
menu) as well. Princess hosts vary, but Cinderella always puts in an
appearance and the Fairy Godmother joins the celebration for dinner.
Advanced Dining Reservations are a must here, and thanks to the crowds,
the most difficult character breakfast to get. If this is a must-do meal, I sug-
gest you begin trying as soon as the reservation window opens up 90 days
in advance (call exactly at 7 a.m. and if — lucky you — you get through on
your first try, don’t get picky about your seating arrangements and dining
times). Note: At the time you make your Advanced Dining Reservations,
your credit card will be charged in full.

The Crystal Palace
The real treats here are the characters, Pooh and his pals, who are on
location throughout the day. The restaurant serves breakfast (eggs, French
toast, pancakes, bacon), lunch, and dinner (a variety of beef, chicken, veg-
gies, kids’ favorites, a sundae bar, and more).

Part IV
Exploring Walt
Disney World

In this part . . . 
I
have some great news for you: You’re going to visit the
“Happiest Place on Earth” And now for the bad news: If
you neglect to plan ahead, you may just be the unhappiest
person there.
In an average year, more than 43 million people ﬁnd their way
to Disney’s four major theme parks, and all are determined to
ride the same rides and eat in the same restaurants as you
(sometimes, it would seem, all at the same time!). You’ll have
much more fun if you arrive knowing which parks and attrac-
tions are best suited to your tastes as well as knowing which
places aren’t worth the effort. In this part, I guide you through
matching up the parks’ features to your tastes so that you can
decide where you want to spend the majority of your time.

Chapter 11
Getting Acquainted with
Walt Disney World
In This Chapter
 Familiarizing yourself with the Disney parks
 Getting to and around the Disney empire
 Pricing the cost of your visit
 Maximizing your fun and minimizing your wait
 Getting around the crowds
T
he first time I made a pilgrimage to the Magic Kingdom, I wandered
in slack-jawed awe among the many marvels of Mickeyville.
Today, I marvel at a different wonder: growth. Walt Disney’s legacy has
exploded in the last three decades. It has truly become a world unto
itself, with four theme parks, nearly a dozen smaller parks and attrac-
tions, clubs, hotels, restaurants, shopping districts, its own transit
system, and two cruise ships. It’s enough to fog your brain, but that’s
why I’m here — to defog and demystify the planning process.
In this and the next several chapters, I introduce you to the parks, tanta-
lize you with ride descriptions, and offer you some suggested itineraries.
With the many thanks to my own children and those of my sisters and
friends, I also use a special ratings system to give you a kid’s view (“Kid
Rating”) of the rides and shows in the parks. My reviews are based on
those of my children: Ryan (13), Austin (11), Nicolas (9), Hailey (7), and
Davis (5).
Introducing Walt’s World
Disney’s four main theme parks line the western half of this 30,500-acre
world. The Magic Kingdom is the original attraction; with just over 16 mil-
lion visitors in 2005, it was busier than any other U.S. theme park. Epcot
was third busiest with 9.9 million visitors, followed by Disney–MGM
Studios at 8.7 million, and Disney’s Animal Kingdom with 8.2 million. (In
case you’re curious, Disneyland, in California, holds the number-2 slot.)
Here’s a quick look at what you can find in all four Disney parks:

 Magic Kingdom: Built as Disney’s flagship park, the Magic Kingdom
is divided into seven themed lands. They’re laid out like the spokes
of a wheel, with the park’s icon — Cinderella Castle — at the hub.
Anyone with kids, or who is just young at heart, needs to give the
Magic Kingdom at least one full day. It offers more for young chil-
dren than any other Orlando theme park, but it has broad appeal
for first-timers and Disney fans, too. If you fall into these categories,
I recommend two days or more, provided you have the time and
the budget. (See Chapter 12 for more details about the Magic
Kingdom.)
 Epcot: Built as an exposition of human achievement and new tech-
nology (albeit a somewhat commercialized version), Epcot is sym-
bolized by Spaceship Earth, an attraction often described as “that
big silver golf ball.” Future World, the first of Epcot’s two sections,
has innovative exhibits and rides. This part of the park is also
home to three of Disney’s newest rides, Soarin’, Mission: SPACE,
and Test Track. The far end of the park, World Showcase, consists
of a lagoon surrounded by pavilions showcasing the cultures of 
11 countries. Allowing two days for the shows, rides, shops, and
ethnic restaurants in Epcot is a good idea. (See Chapter 13 for more
details about Epcot.)
This park is the least attractive for younger children, but the best
one for inquiring minds and those who appreciate the world’s
unique cultures (as well as ethnic dining; see Chapter 10).
 Disney–MGM Studios: This showbiz-themed park is reminiscent of
the Tinseltown of the ’30s and ’40s. It blends working studios with
shows such as the all new Lights, Motors, Action! Extreme Stunt
Show and Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular!, as well as thrill
rides such as the Twilight Zone Tower of Terror and Rock ’n’
Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith. Young kids will find plenty of
cool things to occupy their time here, though they won’t be able to
do the two major thrill rides. And best of all for the foot-weary: You
can tackle this part of WDW in only one day, and a more relaxed
one at that. (See Chapter 14 for more details about Disney–MGM
Studios.)
 Disney’s Animal Kingdom: The newest Disney kid on the block is
symbolized by the 14-story Tree of Life, which is to this park what
Cinderella Castle is to the Magic Kingdom. At this park, guests
explore Asia, Africa, and even the age of the dinosaur. The wildlife
exhibit and theme park feature shows such as It’s Tough to Be 
a Bug! and Festival of the Lion King, as well as rides such as
Expedition Everest — Legend of the Forbidden Mountain,
Kilimanjaro Safaris, and DINOSAUR. You won’t have trouble tour-
ing this park in one day, but keep in mind that this one’s best seen
early in the day. (See Chapter 15 for more details about Disney’s
Animal Kingdom.)

Walt Disney World Parks and Attractions
Chapter 11: Getting Acquainted with Walt Disney World 173
Have time for more?
In addition to the big four, a few other parks and attractions round out
the Disney empire:
 DisneyQuest is a whole lot more than just a fancy video arcade. It’s
a virtual-reality world unto itself, with top-flight games and simula-
tors that put the game consoles you have at home to shame.
 Disney’s Wide World of Sports Complex is a 240-acre complex
filled with an array of state-of-the-art sports facilities for football,
soccer, baseball, softball, as well as other sports and activities. At
the interactive Multi-Sports Experience, guests can participate in a
variety of challenges that put their skills to the test. The complex
also has a 7,500-seat baseball stadium that’s the spring training
home of the Atlanta Braves.

 Walt Disney World Speedway has a stock-car–racing track that
serves as host to the Richard Petty Driving Experience, where you
can either drive a car or ride shotgun at 145 mph. (If you’re from
Talladega or Darlington, you probably can do that in your sleep.)
 A pair of themed miniature golf courses with whimsical décor
schemes (think “Santa goes to the beach” and “Disney classic film
comes alive”) entertain even as they challenge putters with all-too-
realistic water hazards and tricky sand traps. To visit Santa in all
his sunny glory, head for Disney’s Winter Summerland Miniature
Golf Course; for Mickey’s sorcerer’s hat and dancing hippos, take
your irons to Fantasia Gardens Miniature Golf Course.
 Two splashy parks let you float along lazy streams, scream down
gravity-defying water slides, and more. They’re especially appealing
in summer, when the heat and humidity are above 90°F and 90 per-
cent, respectively. Kids and adults alike will enjoy cooling off at
Blizzard Beach and Typhoon Lagoon.
I give you more info about these attractions in Chapter 16.
Planet Disney also has several shopping (see Chapter 17) and nightlife
(see Chapter 25) venues. For example:
 Disney’s BoardWalk is a good place to stroll along the waterfront,
dine, dance, or catch a game in the sports bar.
 Downtown Disney comprises Pleasure Island, an adult nightclub
district; Downtown Disney Marketplace, which features dining and
shopping; Downtown Disney West Side, with shopping, dining,
Cirque du Soleil, and the House of Blues; and DisneyQuest, a high-
tech, interactive video arcade.
Part IV: Exploring Walt Disney World 
174
Palling around with Mickey
Pal Mickey is a talking, 101⁄2-inch-tall, stuffed, digital Mickey Mouse who serves as a
semi-amusing novelty guide to the Disney parks, telling guests about parades, show-
times, and so on when activated. Designed for kids, he nevertheless gets toted around
by adults, too. (Pal Mickey comes with an attachable belt clip and most grown-ups,
much to the amusement of their kids, often get confused and go for their pagers when
he vibrates to let them know he has a message for them). His computer chip picks up
wireless signals throughout the park and dispenses pertinent fun and facts; after you
leave the park, a few corny jokes and silly songs are all that’s left of his repertoire. Pal
Mickey operates on three AA batteries — they’re included! — and dispenses more
than 700 bits of wisdom. He’s available for purchase ($65) inside all Disney resort gift
shops, and at select stores inside the theme parks. For that much money, I’d prefer
the real Mickey to show me around instead of his little electronic brother, but at least
you can take him home.

You can get additional information about all WDW properties by calling
% 407-934-7639 or visiting www.disneyworld.com.
Want to go behind the scenes?
If you’d like an insider’s look at how the Wizards of Diz make magic,
behind-the-scenes tours are the way to go. So many options are avail-
able that the Disney folks sometimes have trouble remembering 
them all.
Reservations are recommended, and, in many cases, essential, for these
tours. Call % 407-939-8687 to make your reservations.
Note: Unless otherwise noted, you have to pay park admission, cur-
rently $67 for adults and $56 for kids 3 to 9, in addition to the tour price.
But ticket prices, times, and tours change often, so check before your
trip by calling Disney’s tour line at % 407-939-8687; for custom guided
tours call % 407-560-4033.
Here’s a sampling of the best offerings:
 Backstage Magic: At the top of the price chain — $199 per 
person — Backstage Magic is a seven-hour, self- and bus-propelled
tour through areas of Epcot, the Magic Kingdom, and Disney–MGM
Studios that aren’t seen by mainstream guests. If you must know
how things work, this tour is for you. You may see mechanics
repairing and building animatronic beings, and you venture into
Magic Kingdom tunnels that aren’t only work areas but also paths
for the cast to get from one place to another without fighting
tourist crowds. It is offered at 9:45 a.m. weekdays and is limited to
20 adults (age 16 or older), so book as early as possible (Disney
recommends at least two months in advance). Lunch is included.
Park admission is not required.
 Disney’s Family Magic Tour: This two-hour scavenger hunt brings
you face to face with Disney characters at the Magic Kingdom 
($25 for ages 3 and older). It kicks off at 11:30 a.m. daily outside
City Hall, but you need to book in advance.
 Disney’s Keys to the Kingdom Tour: Receive a 41⁄2-hour orientation
to the Magic Kingdom and a glimpse into the high-tech systems
behind Mickey’s magic. It’s $58 for ages 16 and older. The tour
starts at 8:30, 9:30, and 10 a.m. daily.
 Hidden Treasures of World Showcase: This 31⁄2-hour tour lets you
explore the architectural and entertainment offerings at Epcot’s 11
World Showcase nations. The tour costs $59 for ages 16 and older
and begins at 9:45 a.m. on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
For those up to the task, not to mention the price tag, make tour
arrangements by calling % 407-560-4033. Photo IDs are required at
check-in for all tours.
Chapter 11: Getting Acquainted with Walt Disney World 175

Finding Your Way to the Fun
If you’re driving, Interstate 4’s Disney exits are clearly marked (though
the exit numbers periodically change thanks to construction). You can’t
miss them unless you close your eyes.
Interstate 4 is woefully crowded, especially during rush hour (7–9 a.m.
and 4–6 p.m. daily). In addition to the thousands of people heading for a
day at the parks, thousands of locals are heading to work. So remember
to factor possible delays into your time schedule.
Parking in the Disney theme-park lots costs $10 per day (unless you’re 
a WDW resort guest, and then it’s free) and is a snap. Just do what the
people in the yellow-striped shirts ask you to do. In the Size-XXXL Magic
Kingdom lot, you’ll probably want to ride the tram to the front gate. (The
trams are a hoot — the seats are made out of petrified plastic, so if you
lack posterior padding, you’ll probably remember the ride for a while.
And don’t forget a jacket if you plan on making a day of it; the ride back
to your car at night can make you feel like you’re one of those frozen
Mickey pops.)
Getting from the parking lot to the action can take up to an hour at the
Magic Kingdom, so be patient as you begin the day. The first stop after
the tram ride is the Transportation & Ticket Center, where you transfer
to the monorail or the ferry to get to the park.
At Epcot, Disney–MGM, and Animal Kingdom, trams are available, but
walking can be faster — unless you have small children or sore feet — if
you’re parked in the front half of the lot.
Don’t forget to make a note of your parking area, including your row and
space number, or you may end up on an unfortunate scavenger hunt
when you head home. After a day spent standing in lines, listening to
screaming kids, and being tapped out by cash registers, you’ll have a
hard time remembering your name, not to mention where you parked.
And the odds are that at least a few of the cars in the lot will be clones of
your own, making it that much harder to spot your own.
If you don’t have a car, or prefer to skip the drive, many area accommo-
dations offer shuttles that are sometimes free but can also carry a fee.
(Check the listings in Chapter 9 for hotels that offer shuttle service.)
Traveling Within the World
If you’re staying at a WDW resort, you can take the Disney
Transportation system to get to the parks. The system also serves
Downtown Disney, Typhoon Lagoon, Blizzard Beach, Pleasure Island,
and Disney’s Wide World of Sports. It’s a thorough network that includes
buses, monorails, ferries, and water taxis serving the major parks from
Part IV: Exploring Walt Disney World 
176

two hours prior to opening until two hours after closing. On the down-
side, it doesn’t always offer direct routes, and moving between locations
can make for a long and complicated journey. For more on the pros and
cons of using the transport system, see Chapter 8. Disney properties
also offer transportation to other area attractions, but you have to pay
for it.
Ask at the Guest Relations desk in your hotel or at the theme parks for a
copy of the Walt Disney World Shopping, Dining & Recreation guide,
which includes a map of the entire Disney Transportation system. The
map shows you everything in the empire and gives you an idea of where
your hotel is in relation to places that you want to visit. You can also
look at the map of WDW’s areas in this chapter to help orient yourself.
Preparing for Park Admission Costs
The number of admission options — from one-day to multiday tickets —
offered at Walt Disney World is staggering, and they’re all expensive. The
option that works best for you depends on the number of days you plan
to spend in the parks, what parks and attractions you want to see, and
whether you’re staying at a WDW resort.
Disney’s new Magic Your Way ticketing system is designed to save you
money the longer you stay and play and allows you to add on several
optional features. Most people get the best value from four- and five-day
Magic Your Way passes with the Park Hopper Option added on, which, as
the name implies, lets you move from park to park on the same day. You
can add Park Hopper privileges to a single-day admission pass, but the
price tag for a single-day ticket with Park Hopper privileges is staggering.
If you plan on visiting Walt Disney World more than one time during the
year, inquire about the No Expiration Option or money-saving annual
passes ($434–$559 adults, $382–$493 children 3–9). For Magic Your Way
ticket prices, see Table 11-1; for other WDW ticket prices, see Table 11-2;
and for Magic Your Way ticket options, see Table 11-3.
Here’s a brief description of the ticket options you see in Table 11-3:
 Park Hopper Option: This option allows you to visit any combina-
tion of the four main theme parks on any given day.
 Water Park Fun & More Option: This option allows you a specific
number of visits (anywhere from three to six, depending on what
you choose) to your choice of Typhoon Lagoon, Blizzard Beach,
DisneyQuest, Pleasure Island, and Disney’s Wide World of Sports
Complex.
 No-Expiration Option: This option allows you to use any unused
portion of your ticket at any time in the future with absolutely no
expiration date.

*Additional cost, on top of the ticket prices in Table 11-1 and Table 11-2.
WDW considers everyone 10 and older an adult, and the prices that 
I give you don’t include 6.5 percent sales tax. Also, fluctuating atten-
dance figures and new multimillion-dollar rides continue to escalate 
the single-day admission fee. (It’s now $67 for adults, $56 for kids 3–9,
but I expect that price to continue rising, so check before your trip for
up-to-the-minute costs.) You can save an average of 10 percent off the
regular prices of all passes by ordering online in advance at www.
disneyworld.com.
Part IV: Exploring Walt Disney World 
178

As with many of the attractions in the area and across the state, Florida
residents can take advantage of additional savings. Inquire about these
savings when ordering your tickets.
The average family will spend $120 to $150 per person per day on park
admissions, midday food, snacks, and souvenirs alone.
Getting the Most out of Your Trip to the World
The Magic Kingdom, Epcot, and Disney–MGM Studios usually open at 9
a.m. (sometimes earlier) throughout the year. They’re open at least until
6 or 7 p.m. and often as late as 11 p.m. or midnight during peak periods
(holidays and the summer months). Animal Kingdom usually opens at 8
or 9 a.m. and closes at 5 or 6 p.m. It’s a safe bet that the longer a park
stays open, the more people will be visiting that day, so planning your
schedule before you get to the park is essential. Unfortunately, hours of
operation vary greatly, so it’s always wise to call % 407-934-7639 ahead
of time, or to check the official calendar on Disney’s Web site at www.
disneyworld.com. When you arrive at the park, pick up a Times Guide
and New Information brochure to use for the rest of your stay.
Beating the lines
Everyone’s looking for a shortcut, and no wonder — lines at Disney and
the other big parks can be incredibly long and irritating if you come at
the wrong time. Twenty minutes is considered cruising when it comes to
line time, and 45 minutes to one hour is common at the primo rides. In
peak periods — summer, holidays, weekends, and other times when kids
are out of school — it can take an hour, sometimes longer, to reach the
front of the line and in three or four minutes, the ride is over.
Here are the best tips I can give you to beat the long lines:
 Come during off-season periods.
 Arrive as early as possible — the crowds pour in beginning at
around 11 a.m. and only get worse from there.
 Plan to spend the morning in one section and the afternoon in
another. That way, you won’t waste time and energy running back
and forth.
 Spend two days in the park if time and your budget allow.
 Ask about or read the health and height restrictions before you get
in line to avoid wasting time on a ride that isn’t for you.
Don’t want to stand in line as long as other guests, yet not flush enough
to hire a stand-in? Disney parks have installed a ride-reservation system
called FASTPASS. Here’s the drill: Hang on to your theme-park ticket
stub when you enter and head to the hottest ride you want. If it’s a FAST-
PASS attraction (they’re noted in the guide map you get when you
Chapter 11: Getting Acquainted with Walt Disney World 179

enter), feed your stub into the waist-level ticket taker. Retrieve your
ticket stub and the FASTPASS stub that comes with it. Look at the two
times stamped on the latter. You can return during that one-hour
window and enter the ride with almost no wait. In the meantime, you can
do something else until the appointed time. Keep in mind that you need
to get a FASTPASS stamp for everyone in your group who wants to ride
the ride.
Note: Early in the day, your one-hour window may begin 40 minutes after
you feed the FASTPASS machine, but later in the day it may be hours,
especially at Epcot’s Test Track (see Chapter 13). Initially, Disney allowed
you to do this reservation system on only one ride at a time, but now,
your FASTPASS ticket has a time when you can get a second FASTPASS,
usually two hours later, even if you haven’t yet used the first pass. And
be prepared, FASTPASS tickets do run out. They’re limited in quantity and
often run out by noon, so be sure to get yours as soon as you can.
Taking advantage of Extra Magic Hours
Each day, a particular park offers either admittance one hour early or 
up to three hours after closing for guests staying at Disney resorts and
“official” hotels. To take advantage of the Extra Magic Hours, your ticket
must be good for the participating park or you must have the Park
Hopper Option (allowing you to enter any of the four major parks). 
The Extra Magic Hours vary, so check the online calendar at http://
disneyworld.disney.go.com/wdw/calendar/extraMagicHour or
pick up a copy of the Times Guide when entering the park. 
Getting a Times Guide and New Information brochure as soon as you
enter the park is essential. The guide is filled with useful information
including park hours, showtimes, restaurant hours, and more. Spend a
few minutes looking it over, noting where you need to be and when.
Many of the attractions in Walt Disney World are nonstop, but others
occur only at certain times or once a day. You can find park maps and
the Times Guide brochures at counters on one side or the other of the
turnstiles; sometimes at both. They’re also available at Guest Relations
and most Disney shops.
Avoiding the Crowds
Crowds are a fact of life at Walt Disney World, but that doesn’t necessar-
ily mean you’ll have to stand in long lines at all the rides and attractions.
Forward thinkers can definitely decrease their risk of encountering a
major swarm of tourists. In addition to FASTPASS (see the “Beating the
lines” section, above), here are some facts to keep in mind as you plan
your crowd-avoiding strategy:
Part IV: Exploring Walt Disney World 
180

 Mondays, Thursdays, and Saturdays are the busiest days in the
Magic Kingdom; Tuesdays and Fridays are the busy days at Epcot;
Sundays and Wednesdays are crowded at Disney–MGM Studios;
and Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays are beastly at Animal
Kingdom.
 Although it isn’t guaranteed, the parks tend to be less crowded
from mid-April (or after the Easter holidays) to late May and from
September through November, except for Thanksgiving. You also
have a better chance of avoiding crowds if you go in the middle of
the week. Also, though most people steer clear on rainy days, the
parks can be less crowded, and you won’t miss much other than
parades. (There’s plenty of good stuff indoors.)
 Finally, if you dine at Disney, make Advanced Dining Reservations
early in the day, or before you arrive at the park, to lock in the time
you want to eat. (See Chapter 10 for more on Advanced Dining
Reservations.)

The Magic Kingdom
In This Chapter
 Locating resources and services in the Magic Kingdom
 Checking out the fun: rides, shows, and attractions
I
f you have kids or a soft spot for vintage or classic Disney, make your
way to this WDW signature park first. The Magic Kingdom is the most
popular of Mickey’s enterprises, attracting more than 40,000 people a
day, with good reason. Be prepared for long lines, and lots of ’em.
Proof of the staying power of the Magic Kingdom lies in the fact that the
park has changed very little during its 30-plus years of existence. Most
of its newer attractions, such as Mickey’s PhilharMagic, are hardly the
adrenaline generators you encounter at other theme parks, but Magic
Kingdom remains the fairest of them all.
Managing Magic Kingdom Logistics
Yes, you can find rides, shows, and characters galore, but you also need
to know some practical items about the Magic Kingdom. This section
gives you the lowdown on prices, hours, and services.
Buying tickets and making reservations
Ticket prices (at press time) for a one-day admission are $67 for adults,
$56 for kids 3 to 9, but these change frequently, so call ahead. (See
Chapter 11 for more information on park admission prices.)
Tickets aren’t the only thing you’ll spend big bucks on. The Magic
Kingdom and the other parks nail you to the tune of $2 or more for a
soda or milk, $1.25 to $2 for bottled water, $2.50 for an ice-cream bar,
and $1.70 (and up) for a cup of coffee or cocoa. Note: If you’re on a tight
budget, whenever you can, bring bottled water from the outside world,
where you can often get an entire six-pack of bottles (freeze them the
night before so they’re really cold) for less than the cost of two bottles
at the parks. A big bag of snacks costs far less and goes a lot further as
well.

When you first show up, make your Advanced Dining Reservations
immediately (if you haven’t done so before arriving) if you want to have
a sit-down meal at a special venue (see Chapter 10 for details). The 
park map you get upon entering lists special shows and daily events.
However, pick up a Times Guide and New Information brochure for a
more thorough schedule of shows, parades, fireworks, special concerts,
and visits from Disney characters.
Arriving early and staying late
Although the Magic Kingdom is usually open daily from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.,
there are exceptions. In fact, the gates sometimes open 15 to 30 minutes
earlier than the official opening time. I recommend trying to get to the
park early, but not just because of the possibility of early opening hours.
An early arrival helps beat morning traffic and allows you a more relaxed
pace to get from the parking lot to the fun, which can take as long as an
hour. At the end of the day, the park often closes later than 6 p.m., some-
times as late as 10 or 11 p.m., especially during the summer and on holi-
days. The Magic Kingdom may even be open as late as midnight for
certain special events. Call % 407-934-7639 for more details.
Locating special services and facilities
In case you forget to bring essential items or need special assistance at
the park, here’s a list of services and facilities that can help:
 ATMs are located at the main entrance, in Frontierland, and in
Tomorrowland. They honor cards from banks using the Cirrus,
STAR, and PLUS systems.
 Baby-changing facilities, including rocking chairs and toddler-size
toilets, are next to the Crystal Palace at the end of Main Street. Of
course, it isn’t the most cost-effective place to buy them, but you
can purchase disposable diapers, formula, baby food, and pacifiers
in the Baby Care Center. Changing tables are also located at the
center, as well as in all women’s restrooms and some of the men’s.
 Disposable cameras and film are available throughout the park,
and Disney has finally caught on to the popularity of digital cam-
eras, offering limited supplies of rechargeable batteries and storage
cards. They also offer CD-burning and picture-printing services at
KODAK Picture Kiosks and select stores at all four theme parks. 
 The First Aid Station, staffed by registered nurses, is located along-
side the Crystal Palace and the Baby Care Center.
 You can access lockers in an arcade underneath the Main Street
Railroad Station. They cost $7, including a $2 refundable deposit.
 Lost children are often taken to City Hall or the Baby Care Center,
where lost children logbooks are kept. Children under 7 should wear
name tags inside their clothing.

 You can send packages from any store to Guest Relations in the
Plaza area, so you can then pick them up at the service desk at
day’s end instead of hauling souvenirs around with you. Allow
three hours for delivery. When you’re staying at the Disney resorts,
you can have your packages sent straight to your resort at no
charge, though it may take a day or two for them to get there.
 Pets, except service animals, are prohibited in the parks, but you
can board yours at the Transportation & Ticket Center’s Pet Care
Kennels (% 407-824-6568). Day rates are $10; overnighters cost
extra.
 Rent strollers at the Stroller Shop near the entrance. The cost is
$10 for a single and $18 for a double.
 Rent wheelchairs at the gift shop to the left of the ticket booths at
the Transportation & Ticket Center or at the Stroller Shop inside
the main entrance to your right. Cost is $10. For EVCs, you pay $35
and a $5 refundable deposit.
 You can find some of your favorite characters at Mickey’s
Toontown Fair. In Fantasyland, look for them in Ariel’s Grotto. In
Mickey’s Toontown Fair head to the Judges Tent and the Toontown
Hall of Fame. Characters also appear in Adventureland (by Pirates
of the Caribbean) and Main Street (near City Hall), as well as in
Liberty Square at the Diamond Horseshoe and occasionally in
Tomorrowland behind Buzz Lightyear’s Space Ranger Spin. (See the
guide map that you get when entering the park.)
You can get more information about WDW properties by calling % 407-
934-7639 or visiting Disney’s Web site (www.disneyworld.com).
Making the Rounds: The Magic 
Kingdom’s Top Attractions
More than three-dozen attractions, an array of shops, and numerous
eateries are located within the Magic Kingdom’s 107 acres. The following
tour, complete with descriptions, begins at the front gates and takes you
counterclockwise through the park’s seven uniquely themed lands. To
find all the listed attractions, see the “Magic Kingdom” map on page 184.
Main Street U.S.A.
Although it’s considered one of the kingdom’s lands, Main Street is more
of an entry zone where you can easily lose yourself in the pleasant nostal-
gia of yesteryear. I recommend passing through it quickly when you
arrive (so you can make a beeline for the more popular attractions before
the lines get too long). You have to make a return voyage on Main Street
when you cry “uncle” at the end of the day. At that time, stamina permit-
ting, you can browse through the shops at a more leisurely pace before
exiting the park. Here are a few of the highlights of Main Street U.S.A.:
Part IV: Exploring Walt Disney World 
186

 Walt Disney World Railroad: This authentic steam-powered train
makes a 15- to 20-minute loop around the park, with stops in
Frontierland and at the far end of Mickey’s Toontown Fair. During
busy periods and parade times, this is a great way to get around
the park without fighting your way through the crowds. It also
gives the kids (and you) a well-deserved, albeit brief, break.
 Harmony Barber Shop: Located on Main Street in Magic Kingdom,
this is a real scissor shop where you can get your hair cut. The bar-
bershop quartet may even take a break from entertaining guests
along the street to serenade you. Hours are from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
daily. Adult haircuts are $17; kid cuts are $14; colored gel will run
you $5. If it’s your child’s very first haircut, Disney barbers will cut
his or her hair for free and throw in a certificate and a set of Mouse
ears. The shop is near the firehouse, but it’s a bit hidden, so keep
your eyes peeled.
Tomorrowland
This land attempts to focus on the future, but in 1994, the WDW folks
realized that Tomorrowland (originally designed in the 1970s) was begin-
ning to look a lot like “Yesteryear.” As a result, Disney revamped the
entire area to show the future as seen from the past (sometime around
the ’20s or ’30s) with a galactic, science-fiction–inspired community
filled with aliens, robots, and video games.
Here’s a sampling of what you can find in Tomorrowland:
 Astro Orbiter: Future astronauts, especially those who are 7-years-
old and younger, love whirling high (and I mean high — you have to
take an elevator to get there) into the galaxy in the colorful rockets
that circle around while gently rising and falling. Unfortunately, the
orbiter lines can stretch for lightyears, so if you’re on a tight
timetable, save it for later.
 Buzz Lightyear’s Space Ranger Spin: On this ride, you go to infin-
ity and beyond in an interactive space adventure in which you help
Buzz defend the Earth’s supply of batteries from the evil Emperor
Zurg. You fly an XP-37 space cruiser armed with twin lasers and a
joystick that’s capable of spinning the craft. (Space Rangers who
get motion sickness should sit this attraction out. There’s enough
space debris flying around without your help.) While you cruise
through space, you collect points by blasting anything that looks or
smells remotely like Zurg (just look for all the neon Zs and shoot).
Your hits trigger light, sound, and animated effects. This ride is a
tamer version of Men in Black Alien Attack at Universal Studios
Florida (see Chapter 18). My 5-year old, 9-year old, and 11-year old
all adore this ride (and have for years).
 Space Mountain: Imagine a roller coaster. Then imagine it in the
dark. This ride, plus Big Thunder Mountain Railroad and Splash
Mountain (both in the “Frontierland” section, later in this chapter),
Chapter 12: The Magic Kingdom 187

are the three major Magic Kingdom attractions that tweens, teens,
and thrill seekers alike head to first, so get here early or use FAST-
PASS. Space Mountain is a classic roller coaster with plenty of dra-
matic dips and drops, and the darkness makes it seem like it’s
going much faster than its top speed of 28 mph. Grab a front seat
for the best ride.
“It was such a rush! In the dark you couldn’t tell what was going to
happen next.” And: “The twists and turns happened really fast —
it’s definitely the coolest ride at Disney.” It’s recommended for
those ages 10 and older, but because it was one of the first genera-
tion of modern, dark-side coasters and is therefore somewhat out-
dated, it’s a bit tamer than some of the more modern thrill rides at
Disney–MGM Studios.
Note, however, that you must be 44 inches or taller to ride, and
there’s a bailout area for those who decide at the last minute that
they’re not quite up to space travel. The seats and lap-bar restraints
on Space Mountain may not fit some larger, plus-size riders.
 Stitch’s Great Escape!: Gone is the ultra-scary ExtraTERRORestrial
Alien Encounter, and in its place is this slightly more family-friendly
attraction based on the Disney hit film Lilo & Stitch. The storyline is
a prequel to the movie, showing the mischief caused by rascally
Experiment 626 (also known as “Stitch”) when he was originally
captured. Those who experienced Alien Encounter will notice that
not that much has changed other than the characters, who are now
far less frightening to look at. The state-of-the-art audio-animatron-
ics are neat, but there are just too many gaps in between. There 
are long periods of darkness with no sound and really nothing
going on — other than the screams of the scared little kids making
their way to the door — and the multisensory effects, including an
odorous burp belted out by Stitch, are a bit over the top.
You must be 38 inches or taller to experience the great escape, a
height restriction that keeps most of Stitch’s fans from even entering.
 Tomorrowland Indy Speedway: Kids, especially those ages 4 to 8,
like slipping into these Indy-car knockoffs and taking them for a spin,
but older children, teens, and adults (especially those with a need
for speed) generally hate them. The long lines and less-than-stellar
steering, combined with an ultra-slow top speed of a mere 7 mph,
add up to one giant snooze of an experience. Additionally, a thick
iron rail separates your tires, so you’re pretty much kept on track.
This isn’t a ride that will make you go vroom, even though you have
to be a minimum of 52 inches tall to drive alone.
 Tomorrowland Transit Authority: The small, five-car trains on this
elevated people-mover are engineless. They work by electromag-
nets, create no pollution, and use little power. The environmentally
friendly cars wind around Tomorrowland and into Space Mountain
on a lazy ride that encourages you to nod off when it’s late in the
day, and you begin to realize that they’ve already covered 4 or 5
Part IV: Exploring Walt Disney World 
188

miles. There’s usually no wait, but this ride is another one to skip if
you’re in a hurry. If you need to rest weary feet or have tired tod-
dlers in tow, however, this one’s a real winner. (It’s also a good
place to wait it out with your little ones when the older kids are
riding Space Mountain.)
 Walt Disney’s Carousel of Progress: Open only seasonally, this
Disney oldie was refurbished to its original state in 1994. The 22-
minute show takes you on a quasi-historical trip through time;
hosted by an audio-animatronic family who explain how their lives
have changed with the introduction of electricity and other techno-
logical advances of the past 50 years. Older guests may find it nos-
talgic, younger ones may wonder how anyone lived before the
invention of video games. Although not particularly exciting, and
definitely one to be skipped if you’re pressed for time, it is nonethe-
less a good way to spend some downtime waiting for the thrill seek-
ers in the family to get through Space Mountain.
Mickey’s Toontown Fair
Head off cries of “Where’s Mickey?” by taking young kids (ages 2 to 8) to
this 2-acre site as soon as you arrive. It’s by far the best place to meet
the characters, including Mickey, Minnie, Donald Duck, Goofy, and Pluto.
The Magic Kingdom’s smallest land is filled with a whimsical collection
of rides, play areas, and candy-striped tents.
 The Barnstormer at Goofy’s Wiseacre Farm: This is a mini roller
coaster designed to look and feel like a crop duster that flies
slightly off-course and right through the Goofmeister’s barn. It has
a 35-inch height minimum, and its tight turns and small dips give
even some adults a rush.
 Donald’s Boat: Also known as the S.S. Miss Daisy, this is an interac-
tive play area with fountains and water snakes that win squeals of
joy (and relief on hot days). Unless you want to wear wet clothes
for the rest of the day, bring along a dry change of clothes or a
swimsuit.
 Mickey’s Country House and Minnie’s Country House: These pro-
vide a lot of visual fun and some interactive areas for youngsters,
though they’re usually crowded and the lines flow like molasses.
Mickey’s place features garden and garage playgrounds. Minnie’s
lets kids play in her kitchen, where popcorn goes wild in a
microwave, a cake billows up in the oven, and the utensils strike up
a symphony of their own.
 Toontown Hall of Fame: This place hosts meet-and-greets with var-
ious Disney characters as well as one of the largest souvenir shops
in the park. You have to wait in line to meet the characters (each
with his or her own separate line, so you’ll have to decide which
one is most worth the wait), but the payoff is that each family is
allowed a few minutes with the character of their choice where
hugs are exchanged and photos are snapped.
Chapter 12: The Magic Kingdom 189

Fantasyland
Disney classics come to life in Fantasyland, where the rides are based on
the movies you grew up with way back when, as well as a few of the
more recent additions to the Disney treasure chest of films. The entire
area is dedicated to the younger set, who would happily spend the
entire day here; unfortunately, the seemingly endless lines eat up a good
portion of your time unless you use FASTPASS. Here’s a list of attractions
in Fantasyland:
 Cinderella Castle: Modeled on several French châteaux, the fairy-
tale Gothic-style castle sits at the end of Main Street in the center of
the park. It’s hard to miss the 189-foot landmark — its 18 towers
reach to the clouds, framed by the picturesque shops of Main
Street U.S.A. The castle is a favorite photo op, and if you land at the
right time, you can meet Cinderella and a handful of other favorite
characters at the Forecourt Stage immediately following the all new
Cinderellabration production (a continuation of the Cinderella
story set during her coronation pageant; the Times Guide and New
Information brochure lists the daily schedule of shows). Otherwise,
the castle is mainly a visual attraction. The interior corridor is lined
with beautiful murals and exquisite mosaics depicting the classic
story of Cinderella. The upper level of the castle is also home to
Cinderella’s Royal Table restaurant (see Chapter 10).
 Cinderella’s Golden Carrousel: This old beauty was built in 1917
by the Philadelphia Toboggan Company and served tours in Detroit
and New Jersey before it was discovered in the late 1960s by
Disney Imagineers and brought to the Magic Kingdom. A patriotic
red, white, and blue in its first incarnation, it was restored and re-
themed in time for the park’s opening; now it tells the tale of
Cinderella in 18 hand-painted scenes set above magnificent antique
horses. It’s a delight for kids and carousel lovers of all ages. The
organ plays — what else? — Disney classics such as “When You
Wish Upon a Star” and “Heigh-Ho.”
 Dumbo the Flying Elephant: This attraction doesn’t do much for
adrenaline-addicted older kids — or line-hating parents — but it’s a
favorite of kids ages 2 through 6. Dumbo’s ears keep them airborne
for a gentle, circular flight with some little dips. Except for the
Disney theme, it’s not all that different from the kiddie rides at most
local carnivals. Most kids older than 6 will be humiliated if you even
suggest they ride it. If your little ones are dying to ride Dumbo, get
here early — wait times are brutal, and it doesn’t have FASTPASS!
This ride is designed for the young ones, so plus-sized parents may
have troubles getting their elephant to fly, and the taller among you
may feel somewhat cramped.
 “it’s a small world”: Young kids and most parents love this attrac-
tion; teens and most other adults, however, may find it a real drag.
Nevertheless, pay your dues — it’s an initiation rite every Disney
visitor needs to undergo, and the sun-sheltered line isn’t usually
Part IV: Exploring Walt Disney World 
190

too long. You glide around the world in small, slow moving boats,
meeting children (audio-animatronic, of course) from around the
world, including Russian dancers, Chinese acrobats, and French
cancan girls, and every one of them sings the catchy little tune that
eats its way into your brain and refuses to stop playing for months.
An 11-year-old’s take: “It was annoying with all the dolls, and the 
song just kept playing over and over.” A 7-year-old: “It was so pretty
with all the fancy costumes and lights in the sky, and nothing was 
scary.” Either way, it’s a cool place to rest for a while if you need a 
break from the summer heat.
If you’ve ridden this attraction in the past, you may notice the
recent refurbishments. This attraction, one of the original few that
opened with the park in 1971 (and originally built by Walt Disney
for the 1964 World’s Fair) underwent a major renovation in 2004
that included painting and repairing the animatronics figures, as
well as replacing the sound system and lights.
 Mad Tea Party: You make this tea party mild or wild, depending on
how much you choose to spin the steering wheel of your gigantic
teacup, though the cup does a little spinning of its own as well.
This ride is suitable for ages 3 and older. Teens and older kids seem
to enjoy this ride’s potential for turning unwary passengers green.
The woozy mouse who pops out of a big teapot in the center of the
platform would no doubt sympathize with those left spinning.
 The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh: Pooh inadvertently
created a small storm of protest when Disney used this ride to
replace the popular Mr. Toad’s Wild Ride in 1999. The Many
Adventures of Winnie the Pooh features the cute-and-cuddly little
fellow along with Eeyore, Piglet, and Tigger. You board a golden
honey pot and ride through a storybook version of the Hundred-
Acre Wood, keeping an eye out for Heffalumps, Woozles, blustery
days, and the “floody place.” This ride has become a favorite of
kids 2 to 8 and their parents, so a FASTPASS is often needed. Just
across the way, kids can run about, climb, slide, and explore while
parents rest their weary feet at Pooh’s Playful Spot, the new tot-
friendly play area themed after the Hundred-Acre Wood.
 Mickey’s PhilharMagic: Mickey, Donald, Ariel, Aladdin, and a 
handful of other favorites appear in this animated and impressively
3-D–enhanced adventure (it’s projected on a 150-foot screen — the
largest wraparound screen on the planet), in which a mischievous
Donald has not so surprisingly gotten into a spot of trouble. This
show is similar to Muppet Vision 3-D (see Chapter 14) at Disney–
MGM Studios, but is far more engaging in its combination of music,
animated film, and special effects that tickle several of your senses.
Kids love the effects, and if you’re a sucker for the classic Disney
films, you will absolutely adore it.
 Peter Pan’s Flight: Another popular ride among visitors younger
than 8, it begins with a nighttime flight over London (even adults
Chapter 12: The Magic Kingdom 191

ooh and aah here) in search of Captain Hook, Tiger Lily, and the
Lost Boys. It’s one of the old glide rides dating back to the limited
technology that was available when the Magic Kingdom was born,
but the simplicity is part of what makes it so popular. Terribly long
lines are almost a signature of this ride, so plan on using a FAST-
PASS to avoid the worst of it. My younger kids wouldn’t miss it no
matter how long they have to wait.
 Snow White’s Scary Adventures: Your journey takes you to the
dwarfs’ cottage and the wishing well, ending with the prince’s kiss
to break the evil spell. This version of the Grimms’ fairy tale is
much less grim than it was years ago, when the focus was inexpli-
cably on the wicked witch, though she still makes several appear-
ances. Snow White now appears in several friendlier scenes,
though kids younger than 4 will likely still get scared.
I can’t recommend it if your time schedule is tight. For those young
enough to want to ride, it’s not worth the tears and screams, and
those who won’t get frightened are too old to get much pleasure
out of it.
Liberty Square
Located between Fantasyland and Frontierland, Liberty Square is a re-
creation of Revolutionary War–era America that infuses you with colo-
nial spirit. Younger guests may not appreciate the historical touches
(such as the 13 lanterns symbolizing the original 13 colonies that hang
from the gigantic live oak), but they’ll delight in the chance to pose for a
picture while locked in the stocks or march along with the fife-and-drum
corps that sometimes makes an appearance along the cobblestone
streets. Although it is one of the smallest lands in the Magic Kingdom,
Liberty Square has an impressive number of attractions, including the
following:
 Liberty Square Riverboat: The steam-powered paddlewheeler
Liberty Belle departs Liberty Square for scenic cruises along 
the rivers of America. The passing landscape recalls the Wild 
West, with an occasional Indian village, and a large wooden fort
peeking through the trees. It makes a restful interlude for foot-
weary park-stompers.
 The Hall of Presidents: American-history buffs ages 10 and older
most appreciate this show, which can be a real squirmer for
younger children. The Hall is an inspiring production based on
painstaking research, right down to the clothes — each president’s
costume reflects his period’s fashion, fabrics, and tailoring tech-
niques. The show begins with a film on the importance of the
Constitution, projected on an immense 180-degree screen, and then
the curtain rises on America’s leaders, from George Washington
through George W. Bush. Pay special attention to the roll call of
presidents. The animatronic figures are incredibly lifelike and amaz-
ingly impressive: They fidget, whisper, and talk to the audience.
Part IV: Exploring Walt Disney World 
192

 The Haunted Mansion: Although this attraction has changed little
through the years, the mansion continues to be a favorite and even
has a cult following. (My editor makes a pilgrimage here every time
she hits the park, as do I.) It has detailed special effects (this was
one of the last rides Walt Disney actually had a hand in designing)
and an atmosphere that’s far more fun than creepy. You may
chuckle at the corny tombstones lining the entrance before you
hop aboard your Doom Buggy and are whisked past a ghostly ban-
quet and ball, a graveyard band, weird flying objects, and more.
And don’t forget the 999 spirits of the house, one of whom may try
to hitch a ride home with you. I always get a kick out of the fact
that Disney has to continually add dust and cobwebs to keep up
this attraction’s old and decrepit appearance.
“The ghosts are really cool, but it’s not all that scary. The best part
is at the end when you see the ghost right next to you.” I whole-
heartedly agree with Ryan (age 13). The ride doesn’t get much
scarier than spooky music, eerie howling, and things that go bump
in the night. It’s best for those ages 6 and older however. FASTPASS
is recommended, because this attraction usually has a long line,
though you might be able to sneak right in at parade time.
Frontierland
Frontierland is located behind Adventureland and the rough-and-tumble
Old West architecture runs to log cabins and rustic saloons, while the
landscape is Southwestern scrubby with mesquite, cactus, yucca, and
prickly pear. Attractions in Frontierland include the following:
 Big Thunder Mountain Railroad: The lines don’t lie: This rocking
railroad is a favorite in the Magic Kingdom. Thunder Mountain
bounces you around an old mining site, where you dodge floods, a
bridge collapse, rock slides, and other mayhem. The ride is some-
thing of a low-grade roller coaster with speed and a lot of corkscrew
action. It has enough of a reputation that even first-time visitors
make a beeline for it. So if you can’t get to it as soon as the park
opens, FASTPASS is your best bet. Or give it a try late in the day, or
when a parade pulls most visitors away from the rides. Most Disney
coaster veterans maintain the ride is at its best after dark.
“So cool . . . you really whip around the mountain, I loved this 
ride.” “It’s really fast and it kind of jerks you around when you’re
turning — that’s so fun.” Austin (11) and Nicolas (9) are both right
on the money — the action is fast and a bit jerky, especially com-
pared to some of the newer monster rides. The ride can be too
intense for kids younger than 6 (and for those with neck problems).
Riders must be at least 40 inches tall.
 Country Bear Jamboree: The stars of this 15-minute animatronic
show are the gigantic bumbling country bears, crooning country-
and-western tunes and completely corny jokes. The Jamboree is a
park standard — a show that’s been around since Disney invented
Chapter 12: The Magic Kingdom 193

dirt — but it’s still a huge hit with Disney buffs and little kids. The
audience gets caught up in the hand-clapping, knee-slapping, foot-
stomping fun as Trixie laments lost love while she sings “Tears Will
Be the Chaser for Your Wine.” Teddi Beara descends from the ceil-
ing in a swing to perform “Heart, I Did All That I Could,” and Big Al
moans “Blood in the Saddle.” It’s a great way to cool off with tired
toddlers, so sit back and relax for a spell.
“You can’t be serious,” were the words uttered by my 13-year-old as
he rushed past in search of Splash Mountain. Unless you have an
affinity for all things Disney or have younger children (6 and under),
this might be best saved for those really hot days when you need a
break inside. Most teens, young adults, and repeat visitors won’t
want to do it, even then.
 Frontierland Shootin’ Arcade: Combining state-of-the-art electron-
ics with a traditional shooting-gallery format, this arcade offers 97
targets (slow-moving ore cars, buzzards, and gravediggers) in an
1850s boomtown scenario. If you hit a tombstone, it may spin
around and mysteriously change its epitaph. Coyotes howl, bridges
creak, and skeletal arms reach out from the grave. To keep things
authentic, newfangled electronic firing mechanisms with infrared
bullets are concealed in genuine buffalo rifles. When you hit a
target, you set off sound and motion gags. Fifty cents fetches 25
shots. Younger kids may find this more frustrating than fun.
 Splash Mountain: If I had to pick one ride as the Kingdom’s most
popular, Splash Mountain would be it (that should properly prepare
you for the lines — sometimes longer than two hours — you will
most definitely end up experiencing). It’s on par with SeaWorld’s
Journey to Atlantis (see Chapter 20), though half a click below
Jurassic Park River Adventure at Islands of Adventure (see Chapter
19). Still, it has a flair that only Disney can deliver. Splash Mountain
is a nifty voyage through the world of Disney’s classic film Song of
the South, past 26 colorful and delightful scenes that include back-
woods swamps, bayous, some spooky caves, and waterfalls. You
ride in a hollow log flume as Brer Fox and Brer Bear chase the ever-
wily Brer Rabbit and end your journey with a 52-foot, 45-degree, 
40-mph finish, with an impressively high splash factor (around 200
megatons worth of wet) that thoroughly soaks you and anyone
remotely close by. If you’re lucky enough to have some real heavy-
weights in the front seat, look for a little extra explosion on the five-
story downhill. Although FASTPASS is available, this is one that
runs out early.
In summer, this ride can provide sweet relief from the heat and
humidity, but in cool weather, parents may want to protect their
kids (and themselves) from a chill. Splash Mountain is recom-
mended for ages 8 and older. If they’re unsure if they want to ride,
let them watch from the bridge for a few minutes — they’ll make up
their minds after they see one or two logs make the drop. Riders
must be at least 40 inches tall.
Part IV: Exploring Walt Disney World 
194

On warmer days, the ride shoots out a spray of water onto the
viewing bridge in front of the big drop. If you want to catch your
friends unaware for a good soaking, count the log drops: Every
third one emits a good spray.
 Tom Sawyer Island: Board Huck Finn’s raft for a two-minute float
across a river to this densely forested island, where kids can
explore Injun Joe’s Cave (complete with such scary sound effects
as whistling wind), navigate a swinging bridge, and explore an old
wooden fort. Narrow, winding dirt paths lined with oaks, pines, and
sycamores create an authentic backwoods atmosphere. It’s easy to
get briefly lost and stumble upon some unexpected adventure. It’s
a great place for kids to lose a little excess energy and for moms
and dads to relax and maybe indulge in a snack at Aunt Polly’s,
which overlooks the river.
“It’s fun just being able to run around, not wait in all the lines.”
“The caves and the bridges were really cool but so was the whole
island.” Nicolas (11) and Austin (9) weren’t the only ones who gave
it great reviews — everyone in the family concurred (though Davis,
age 5, preferred to avoid exploring the darkened caves).
Adventureland
Adventureland is a left turn just at the end of Main Street. Kids can
engage in swashbuckling behavior while walking through dense tropical
foliage (complete with vines) or marauding through bamboo and thatch-
roofed huts. The architecture here is a combination of the Caribbean,
Southeast Asia, and Polynesia. Walt Disney wanted this section of the
park to exude romance, mystery, and (duh!) adventure. There’s plenty of
the latter here, especially for kids, though you may have more trouble
finding the first two. Here is a list of some of the most popular attrac-
tions in Adventureland:
 The Enchanted Tiki Room: Upgraded over the years, the show’s
newest cast member is Iago of Aladdin fame. This attraction is set
in a Polynesian-style building with thatched roof, bamboo beams,
and tapa-bark murals. Other players include 250 tropical birds,
chanting totem poles, and singing flowers that whistle, tweet, and
warble. The show runs continuously throughout the day. Young
children are most likely to appreciate this one, but so will nostalgic
adults. (Children younger than 2 may be frightened by the loud
noises.) Otherwise, consider this only as a respite from the heat.
 Jungle Cruise: Give Disney ten minutes, and it gives you four
famous rivers on three different continents. This narrated voyage
on the Congo, Amazon, Mekong, and Nile rivers offers glimpses of
animatronic animals, tropical and subtropical foliage (most of it
real), a Temple of Doom–type camp, and lots of surprises. The ride
passes animatronic pythons, elephants, rhinos, gorillas, and hippos
that pop threateningly out of the water and blow snot — well, it
could’ve been snot if they weren’t robots — on you. This exhibit is
Chapter 12: The Magic Kingdom 195

about 30 years old, which means it’s pretty hokey at times, but it’s
still a nice way to relax if the lines don’t stretch too long (though
the waiting area for this ride does offer some amusing moments —
check out the prop menus on the walls).
 The Magic Carpets of Aladdin: The first major ride added in
Adventureland since 1971 delights wee ones and even some older
kids. Its 16 four-passenger carpets circle the giant genie’s bottle,
while camels spit water at unsuspecting riders in much the same
way riders are spritzed at One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish at
Islands of Adventure (see Chapter 19). As the fiberglass carpets
spin, you can move them up, down, forward, and back.
If the lines are too long at Dumbo (see the “Fantasyland” section,
earlier in this chapter), this is a good alternative, as the rides are
similar and the lines here aren’t nearly as sluggish.
 Pirates of the Caribbean: This oldie-but-goodie is another cult
favorite (a Disney archivist confessed to me that it’s still his favorite,
which should be no great surprise given that this is another ride that
Walt Disney had a hand in creating). After walking through a long,
and somewhat eerie, grotto, you board a boat headed into a dark
cave where you are warned that “Dead men tell no tales.” Therein,
elaborate scenery and hundreds of incredibly detailed (some of
Disney’s best) animatronic figures re-create an almost refreshingly
non-P.C. Caribbean town overrun by buccaneers. To a background of
cheerful yo-ho-ho music, the sound of rushing waterfalls, squawking
seagulls, and screams of terror, passengers pass through the line of
fire into a raging raid and panorama of almost fierce-looking pirates
swigging rum, looting, and plundering. Recent refurbishments,
impeccably timed with the release of Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead
Man’s Chest in 2006, have Jack Sparrow, Barbossa, and Davy Jones
joining the marauding mayhem while a tweak and a twist in the sto-
ryline and enhanced special effects freshen up this old favorite. This
ride, in addition to being one of the best in the park, is another great
place to cool off on a hot day.
“The drop takes you by surprise — that’s pretty cool, and the
pirates are great, it’s almost like being in the middle of the movie.”
Kids ages 5 and younger may find a pirate’s life a bit too scary, espe-
cially with the small drop in the dark. Most kids 6 or older, though,
will enjoy it. The recent films based on the ride have made it even
more popular with the young and teen set, who have fun spotting
the scenes, and now famous faces, appropriated by the movie.
Offer a tip of your head to the parrot who sits above the ride’s
entrance plaza and you may get a hearty greeting in response.
 Swiss Family Treehouse: The story of the shipwrecked Swiss
Family Robinson (via the 1960 Disney film of the same name)
comes alive in this attraction made for swinging, exploring, and
crawling fun. The “tree,” designed by Disney Imagineers, has
330,000 polyethylene leaves sprouting from a 90-foot span of
Part IV: Exploring Walt Disney World 
196

branches; although it isn’t real, it’s draped with actual Spanish
moss. It’s simple and devoid of all that high-tech stuff that’s popu-
lar in today’s parks, but that’s what makes it so fun.
Be prepared to stand in a slow-moving line on busy days — the
only thing that moves on this one are your feet, so the experience
is only as fast paced as the people ahead of you make it. The attrac-
tion is also difficult for travelers with limited mobility to navigate.
My younger kids (those under 9) thought it was neat, while the
older ones moved onward (and quickly) to bigger adventures.
Parades and fireworks
Disney excels at producing fanfare, and its parades and fireworks displays
are among the best of their kind in the world. Note, however, that some
productions are staged only on a limited basis or during certain times of
the year. Grab a Times Guide and New Information brochure when you
arrive. It includes an entertainment schedule that lists special goings-on
for the day, including concerts, encounters with characters, holiday
events, and other major happenings. If you want to know whether a spe-
cific parade or fireworks show will be staged when you’re in town, consult
the calendar at www.disneyworld.com or call % 407-934-7639.
During fireworks and parades, Disney ropes off designated viewing spots
for travelers with disabilities and their parties. Consult your park map or
a park employee at least an hour before the parade, or you may have
trouble making it through the crowds to get to the designated spots.
Additionally, if there are two showings of a parade, the later one is usu-
ally less crowded.
If nobody in your party is a huge parade fan, these are the best times to
ride some of the more popular attractions — while everyone else is lined
up along the parade route. You can also use the Walt Disney World
Railroad (mentioned earlier in the chapter) to navigate around the vari-
ous areas of the park when the parade route has blocked off most major
routes through the park.
Here are Disney’s best parades and fireworks displays:
 Wishes Nighttime Spectacular: This explosive display debuted in
fall 2003 and is touched off nightly at closing, except during the
summer and on holidays when extended park hours allow for the
fireworks to be shown between two scheduled showings of the
“SpectroMagic” Parade (see next in this list). Before the display,
Tinker Bell flies magically from Cinderella Castle. Then as a caco-
phany of intricately choreographed fireworks fills the skies, and
Jiminy Cricket narrates, images are projected onto the castle in
time to the medley of Disney songs being broadcast parkwide.
Suggested viewing areas include almost anywhere on the front side
of Cinderella Castle, including the very front of Liberty Square and
Adventureland. The back of Liberty Square, Frontierland, and
Mickey’s Toontown Fair offer views as well, though some of the
Chapter 12: The Magic Kingdom 197

spectacular effects get a bit lost from behind. Disney hotels close to
the park (the Grand Floridian, Polynesian, Contemporary, and
Wilderness Lodge — all reviewed in Chapter 9) also offer views, as
the fireworks display is rather large. This show can make even the
most blasé fireworks watcher say, “Wow!”
 “SpectroMagic” Parade: This after-dark parade combines fiber
optics, holographic images, clouds of liquid nitrogen, old-fashioned
twinkling lights, and a soundtrack featuring classic Disney tunes.
Mickey, dressed in an amber and purple grand magician’s cape,
makes an appearance in a confetti of light. You’ll also see the
SpectroMen atop the title float, and Chernabog, Fantasia’s mon-
strous demon, who unfolds his 38-foot wingspan. It takes the elec-
trical equivalent of seven lightning bolts (enough to power a fleet of
2,000 trucks) to bring the show to life.
SpectroMagic plays only on limited nights, when park closing
extends past dusk (generally during busy periods and on week-
ends). When park hours are extended to 10 p.m. or later, there are
often two chances to view the parade. Check your show schedule
to determine availability.
 Share a Dream Come True Parade: This parade honors the 100th
anniversary of Uncle Walt’s birth (which has come and gone though
the parade lives on). Loads of characters (over 110 cast members
take part) march up Main Street and into Frontierland in gigantic
snowglobes on a daily basis. It’s one of the most popular parades in
the park because it takes place during the height of the day.

rab a big pot. Start with a theme-park foundation, stir in a heaping
helping of technology, and add splashes of global architecture,
street performers, and interactive exhibits. What do you have? Epcot, a
science field trip combined with a whirlwind tour of the world — with-
out the jet lag, although some say it’s just as draining when you try to
experience it in one day.
Walt Disney wanted his “Experimental Prototype Community of
Tomorrow” to be a high-tech city. But, when it opened 15 years after his
death, it was a theme park, and the name was shortened to an acronym,
Epcot, because, well, it looked good in the snazzy Disney brochures.
Although the Magic Kingdom is every child’s dream, Epcot isn’t. It’s
techno and worldly. Epcot is best suited for older children (over 8) and
adults with vivid imaginations or cravings to know how things work —
or will work in the future. It’s the least friendly of the Disney parks for
those younger than 8, even with Disney’s relatively recent additions that
were intended to keep the younger members of the family entertained. If
you have wee ones, or if all your kids are under the age of 6, I recom-
mend skipping it this time around. If, on the other hand, you have older
kids or an inquiring mind yourself, I suggest at least a two-day visit
because it’s so vast and varied. In the World Showcase, you experience
exotic, far-flung lands without a passport; you can visit China’s Temple
of Heaven, or Italy’s St. Mark’s Square. In Future World, you can jump
into the third millennium as you explore cutting-edge technology and
the latest and greatest thrill rides.

Discovering Epcot’s Essentials
Before helping you dive into Epcot’s attractions, I need to get a few prac-
tical matters out of the way.
Buying tickets and making reservations
Tickets to Epcot cost $67 for a one-day adult admission, $56 for kids
ages 3 to 9, but prices frequently change. See Chapter 11 for other admis-
sion options.
Tickets aren’t the only thing that will deplete your stash of cash. The
prices of consumables are pretty much standard among Disney parks.
Epcot will put you out $2 or more for a soda or milk, $1.25 to $2 for bot-
tled water, $2.50 for an ice-cream bar, and $1.70 (and up) for a cup of
coffee or cocoa.
You can make Advanced Dining Reservations (see Chapter 10) at Guest
Relations in the Plaza area, though it’s best to make them ahead of time
by calling % 407-939-3463.
Future World usually is open from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. and sometimes as late
as 10 p.m. World Showcase opens at 11 a.m. and generally remains open
until 9 p.m., sometimes later.
Locating special services and facilities
In case you forgot to bring essential items, or if you need special assis-
tance while at the park, here’s a list of services and facilities that may
come in handy:
 ATM machines accept cards from banks using Cirrus, STAR, and
PLUS. You can find them at the front of the park, in the American
Pavilion (near the very back), and on the bridge between World
Showcase and Future World.
 The baby-changing area for Epcot is located in the Baby Care
Center near the Odyssey Center in Future World. It sells disposable
diapers, formula, baby food, and pacifiers. Changing tables are in
all women’s and some men’s restrooms.
 You can buy disposable cameras and film throughout the park,
including a limited selection of digital supplies. CD burning and pic-
ture printing services are available at KODAK Picture Kiosks and
select stores at all four theme parks.
 Registered nurses staff the First Aid Station. It’s located near the
Odyssey Center in Future World.
 Lockers are located west of Spaceship Earth, outside the Entrance
Plaza, and in the Bus Information Center by the bus parking lot.
The cost is $7 a day, including a $2 deposit.
Part IV: Exploring Walt Disney World 
202

 Lost children are usually taken to Earth Center or the Baby Care
Center. Children under 7 should wear name tags on the inside of
their clothing.
 You can send packages from any store in the park to Guest
Relations in the Entrance Plaza area, where you can pick them up
all at once at the end of the day. (This service is free.) Allow three
hours for delivery. A package pickup also is located at the
International Gateway entrance in the World Showcase. Disney
resort guests can have their purchases sent directly to their hotels.
 You can arrange pet care for $10 a day at the Pet Care Kennels out-
side the Entrance Plaza at Epcot (% 407-824-6568). Proof of vacci-
nation is required. Four other kennels are available in the WDW
complex.
 Rent strollers east of the Entrance Plaza and at World Showcase’s
International Gateway. The cost is $10 for a single and $18 for a
double.
 Rent wheelchairs inside the Entrance Plaza to your left, to the 
right of ticket booths at the gift shop, and at World Showcase’s
International Gateway; they cost $10. Electric chairs cost $35 a day
plus a $5 deposit.
Call % 407-934-7639 or visit www.disneyworld.com to obtain addi-
tional information about WDW properties.
Touring Epcot’s Top Attractions
Epcot’s 300 acres are vibrantly landscaped, so enjoy the scenery on your
way through its two very distinctive areas, Future World and World
Showcase.
Epcot is big enough that walking around it can be exhausting (the World
Showcase semicircle alone is 1.3 miles). That’s why some people say
Epcot stands for “Every Person Comes Out Tired.” If you don’t spend
much time lingering in the World Showcase, you can see all Epcot in one
day, but you’ll need a vacation after you’re finished. A boat launch runs
from Future World to Germany or Morocco so unless you want the com-
plete world tour, this may be a great way to get a sampling of World
Showcase. The good news is that most of the attractions take a fair
amount of time, giving you a break between all that walking.
To locate the attractions I discuss in the following sections, check out
the “Epcot” map on p. 201.
Experiencing Future World
Most visitors enter Epcot through the main entrance at Future World
(there is, unlike at any other park, a back entrance where guests of the
BoardWalk, Swan, Dolphin, Yacht Club, and Beach Club resorts have
Chapter 13: Epcot 203

access by boat). Spaceship Earth, that thing that looks like the giant
silver golf ball meant for a club to fit Paul Bunyan, centers Future World.
Major corporations such as Hewlett-Packard, General Motors, Nestlé,
and Kodak sponsor Future World’s nine themed areas. The exhibits
focus on discovery, scientific achievements, and technology in areas
spanning from energy to undersea exploration.
Innoventions: The Road to Tomorrow
The crescent-shaped buildings to your right and left, just beyond
Spaceship Earth, showcase cutting-edge technology and future products
in the Innoventions exhibit. The headliner in the building to the left
(Innoventions East) as you enter the park is House of Innoventions,
which offers a preview of tomorrow’s smart house (including a refrigera-
tor that can itemize and order groceries, and a Jacuzzi with surround
sound). A recent addition is Plastic Works, where kids can build their
own robot and — bonus — they get to keep it for free. The Test the
Limits Lab exhibit has six kiosks that let kids and fun-loving adults try
out a variety of products. In one, you can pull a rope attached to a
hammer that crashes into a TV screen to see whether it’s shatter resist-
ant. Other exhibits focus on communications, the Segway transport
device, the Internet, and your business savvy.
Across the way at Innoventions West, crowds flock to Video Games of
Tomorrow, which has nearly three dozen game stations, and the
Ultimate Home Theater, which offers a look at the history of home
entertainment and a futuristic home setup that will have couch potatoes
salivating. ThinkPlace presented by IBM looks at various interactive
software programs (including voice-recognition technology) and also
features Internet postcards that allow you to take a picture and send it
via e-mail to family and friends back home. Where’s the Fire? is
America’s largest fire-safety display, where kids can get an up-close look
at a life-size fire truck and follow a lighted path through a burning house
to safety. Other diversions include a virtual-reality playground and a dis-
play highlighting advances in the life sciences at the Great American
Farm. Rockin’ Robots, the latest addition to Innoventions, has cyber-
sonic cyborgs making music from items (some instrumental, others
most definitely not) of your choosing.
Imagination! Pavilion
Even the fountains in front of this pavilion are magical — shooting water
snakes through the air. (The fountains are popular with kids, who like to
try to catch water snakes and, in the process, get a good soaking.)
The pavilion’s main attraction is the 3-D “Honey, I Shrunk the
Audience” ride, based on the Disney film Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, in
which you’re caught up in all the mayhem of another shrinking experi-
ment gone awry. Inside, mice terrorize you and, after you’re shrunk, a
large cat adds to the trauma; then a giant 5-year-old gives you a good
shaking. Vibrating seats and sensory effects enhance all the 3-D action.
In the end, everyone is returned to proper size — but not the dog, who
Part IV: Exploring Walt Disney World 
204

offers up one final surprise. Kids under 4 may be frightened by some of
the special effects; most older kids will be utterly amused.
On Journey Into Imagination with Figment, things begin with an open
house at the Imagination Institute, with Dr. Nigel Channing (played by
Monty Python’s Eric Idle) taking you on a tour of the labs that demon-
strate how the senses capture and control one’s imagination. Figment
arrives at each of the areas to prove it’s far, far better to set your imagi-
nation free. He invites you to his upside-down house, where a new per-
spective enhances your imagination. This ride is best for the younger
set; older kids may find it too tame.
After you disembark from the ride, head for the Kodak “What If” Labs,
where your kids can burn lots of energy while exercising their imagina-
tions at a number of interactive stations that allow them to conduct
music, experiment with video, or transform themselves into animals.
The lab can be accessed from the outside as well, so older kids can
experiment while waiting for their younger siblings to ride along with
Figment.
The Land Pavilion
The Land is Future World’s largest pavilion (a whopping 6 acres) and
showcases the wonders of food and the environment. Living with the
Land, a 14-minute boat ride through a simulated rain forest, an African
desert, and the Great Plains, may be a tad too dry for visitors not inter-
ested in agriculture. New farming methods and experiments ranging
from hydroponics to plants growing in simulated Martian soil are show-
cased in real gardens.
A 45-minute Behind the Seeds walking tour for gardeners and others
who want a more detailed agricultural lesson is offered daily and costs
$12 for adults and $10 for kids 3 to 9. Sign up at the Green Thumb
Emporium to the right of the Sunshine Seasons food court area.
Live footage and animation mix in Circle of Life, a 15-minute, 70mm
motion picture based on The Lion King. The story line has Timon and
Pumbaa building a monument to the good life called Hakuna Matata
Lakeside Village, but their project, as Simba points out, is damaging the
savanna for other animals. It’s a fun, but pointed, environmental message.
The Land’s newest attraction is Soarin’, a ride borrowed from Disney’s
California Adventure park. The experience combines cinematic artistry
and state-of-the-art motion technology as you’re seated in mock-gliders
and lifted 40 feet inside a giant projection-screen dome. Completely sur-
rounded with the beauty and wonder of the state of California, the ele-
vated seats take you on a scenic tour over the Golden Gate Bridge, the
redwood forests, Napa Valley, and Yosemite, gliding and swooping over
the changing landscapes. You can even feel the sweeping winds and
smell fragrant orange blossoms and pine trees around you. The entire
experience is absolutely one of the best in all of Disney. It makes me
Chapter 13: Epcot 205

wonder if a version showcasing Florida’s highlights may be next . . .
Epcot is in Florida after all. You must be 40 inches tall to ride. This is defi-
nitely a good candidate for FASTPASS as the lines are lengthy with wait
times of at least an hour, even during the slower seasons.
The Living Seas Pavilion
The Living Seas Pavilion has a 5.7-million-gallon aquarium filled with
more than 4,000 sharks, barracudas, rays, dolphins, and other reef fish.
It starts with a film, The Seas, demonstrating the formation of the Earth
and the seas as a means to support life. You also can see other exhibits
such as a diving barrel used by Alexander the Great in 332 B.C. and Sir
Edmund Halley’s first diving bell (1697). At the time this guide went to
press, the hydrolators (the somewhat hokey elevator ride that transports
guests to Sea Base Alpha) had been removed and renovations were
underway to revamp the entrance as well as various other areas within
the exhibit. The two-level sea base displays numerous exhibits dealing
with various aspects of marine science and technology, and — most
important of all — through acrylic windows, you get close-up views of
real denizens of the deep, as they swim amidst a tremendous man-made
coral reef. Both kids and adults enjoy visiting the rescued manatees 
(sea cows), which reside on the second level.
In the past, I’ve complained that the Living Seas could be a snoozer for
younger kids unless they’re fascinated by the sea. Disney must have
been listening, because they’ve added a few attractions that are sure to
keep kids younger than 10 entertained. Turtle Talk with Crush, an inter-
active theater presentation, captivates kids’ attention, as well as their
hearts. In a small theater, adults are seated on benches in the back while
children are asked to sit on the floor right in front of the screen (which,
for the moment, looks like a giant underwater viewing area). After a brief
Part IV: Exploring Walt Disney World

Water-cooler conversations
Many an ordinary item at Disney World has hidden entertainment value. Take a sip of
water at the drinking fountain in Epcot’s Innoventions Plaza (the one right next to the
Mouse Gear shop close to Innoventions East) and it may beg you not to drink it dry. No,
you haven’t gotten too much sun — the fountain actually talks (much to the delight of
kids and the surprise of unsuspecting adults). A few more talking fountains are scat-
tered around Epcot.
The fountains aren’t the only items at WDW that talk. I’ve kibitzed with a walking and
talking garbage can (named PUSH) in Tomorrowland at the Magic Kingdom (he’s been
known to make appearances at Epcot as well). An assortment of sassy (if not mobile)
garbage cans are also in place at the Magic Kingdom inside Cosmic Ray’s Starlight
Café. And a personable palm tree (who goes by Wes Palm) may strike up a conversa-
tion with you at Animal Kingdom. Ask a Disney employee to direct you if you want to
meet any of these chatty contraptions.

introduction, Crush, a 152-year-old sea turtle from the film Finding Nemo,
appears swimming around, chit-chatting to himself and, before you know
it, with the kids — and I mean really conversing. Through some amazing
technology and animation, the talking turtle can “see” the audience, pick
out whose question he’d like to answer by describing his or her cloth-
ing, and actually respond to his or her questions. Kids love it.
Disney has also added a small play area where little ones can expend
some of their extra energy. Bruce’s Sub House features some larger-
than-life (albeit animated) sharks to climb on, in, and around.
Parts of the refurbishments include the addition of yet another family-
friendly attraction: The Seas with Nemo & Friends. Scheduled to open
late in 2006, this attraction picks up where the blockbuster hit Finding
Nemo left off. “Clammobiles” slowly transport guests through the color-
ful coral reef in search of Nemo — who has once again wandered off
from his class field trip with Mr. Ray. Kids will spot several familiar fishes
along the way including Dory, Bruce, Marlin, Squirt, and Crush, who hap-
pily join in on the search. The ending is, of course, a happy one, and
Nemo is safely reunited with his friends.
Epcot DiveQuest is a program that enables certified divers ages 10 and
up (those between 10 and 14 are required to have an adult participate
along with them) to take part in a three-hour program that includes a 
40-minute dive in the Living Seas aquarium. The program costs $140. Call
% 407-939-8687 for details. Keep in mind, however, that you get more
dolphins for your money at Discovery Cove (see Chapter 20).
Spaceship Earth Pavilion
Epcot’s iconic, silvery geosphere houses an attraction of the same name, a
slow-track journey back to the roots of communications. The 15-minute
ride begins with Cro-Magnon cave painting and then advances to Egyptian
hieroglyphs, the Phoenician and Greek alphabets, the Gutenberg printing
press, and the Renaissance. Technologies develop at a rapid pace,
through the telegraph, telephone, radio, movies, and TV. It’s but a short
step to the age of electronic communications. You’re catapulted (though
slowly) into outer space to see Spaceship Earth from a new perspective,
returning for a finale that places the audience amid interactive global net-
works. Unfortunately, the presentation is not particularly engaging, and I
recommend skipping it unless it’s a really hot day, you need time off your
feet, or you have time to spare.
Test Track Pavilion
Test Track is a $60-million marvel of a ride that combines GM engineer-
ing and Disney Imagineering. You can wait in line an hour or more during
peak periods, so use FASTPASS. (See Chapter 11 for more information
about beating the long lines.) During the last part of your wait, you
snake through displays about corrosion, crash tests, and more. The five-
minute ride follows what looks to be an actual highway. It includes brak-
ing tests, a hill climb, and tight S-curves in a six-passenger “convertible.”
Chapter 13: Epcot 207

The left-front seat offers the most thrills as the vehicle moves through
the curves. There’s also a 12-second burst of heart-pumping speed to
the tune of 65 mph on the straightaway (with no traffic!). It’s one of the
best thrill rides in Epcot, and for those who can’t stomach roller coast-
ers, it offers a few thrills that you most likely can handle.
“The beginning is a lot of stopping and starting but once you hit 60 it’s a
blast.” Thirteen-year-old Ryan liked it, but it may be too intense for
those younger than 10, and it has a 40-inch height minimum. The single-
rider line (which allows singles to fill in vacant spots in select cars) can
speed up your wait time if all the FASTPASSES are gone — which really
happens! — but you have to be willing to split up your party to use it.
Also keep in mind that rain will shut it down, so head here early in the
day if there’s even the slightest chance of a sprinkle.
Mission: SPACE Pavilion
The headliner for the Mission: SPACE Pavilion is a motion simulator like
those used by astronauts training for space. (Think G-force and weight-
lessness.) You assume the role of commander, pilot, navigator, or engi-
neer, depending on where you sit, and must complete related jobs vital
to a flight to the Red Planet (don’t worry if you miss your cue, you won’t
crash). The ride uses a combination of visuals, sound, and centrifugal
force to create the illusion of a launch and trip to Mars. As the launch
begins, your rocket rumbles under you, white clouds of steam billow
around you, and you shoot into the galaxy. Of course, some unexpected
twists and turns require you to react pronto in order to complete your
mission successfully. Even veteran roller-coaster riders who tried the
simulator said the sensation mimics a liftoff, as riders are pressed into
their seats and the roar and vibration tricks the brain during the launch
portion of the four-minute adventure.
In the pre-ride show, you go to the futuristic International Space Training
Center and then proceed to the Ready Room where you learn your role
as commander, pilot, navigator, or engineer from CapCom (played by
actor Gary Sinese, who co-starred in Apollo 13).
Because this is probably one of the most physically intense rides in all of
Mickeyville, Disney was prompted to create a less-intense version after
numerous guests reportedly experienced various adverse affects. By
removing the centrifuge from two of the four simulators, riders can now
choose their experience; the original G-force generator, or a milder, mel-
lower Mission. If you are prone to motion sickness from spinning, have a
sinus infection, or experience severe claustrophobia, the mellower ver-
sion would definitely be the better choice. There’s a reason they put
motion sickness bags in each capsule and post all the warnings. After
the door of your pod closes, that’s it — there’s no escape. You’re going
to Mars whether you like it or not. If you choose the original and the
experience gets to be too much midtrip, a Disney Imagineer told me that
focusing straight ahead can help minimize the effects, and he warned
against closing your eyes as that actually enhances the ride’s intensity.
Part IV: Exploring Walt Disney World 
208

So you know, if you’re taller (or shorter, in the case of younger kids)
than average, you may have difficulties seeing the screen from the opti-
mum perspective or handling the controls from the optimum angle.
“It was awesome — the whole ride was intense, but awesome.” Thirteen-
year-old Ryan, who has an intense hatred for roller coasters, survived
and was even smiling after the (original) ride, but be aware that it may
be far too intense for those younger than 10 and it has a 44-inch height
minimum.
Universe of Energy
Sponsored by Exxon, Universe of Energy has a roof full of solar panels
and a goal of bettering your understanding of America’s energy prob-
lems and potential solutions. Ellen’s Energy Adventure, the pavilion’s
32-minute ride, features comedienne Ellen DeGeneres tutored by Bill Nye
the Science Guy to be a Jeopardy! champ. An animated movie depicts the
Earth’s molten beginnings, its cooling process, and the formation of
fossil fuels. You then move back 275 million years into an eerie, storm-
wracked landscape of the Mesozoic Era. Giant audio-animatronic drag-
onflies, pterodactyls, dinosaurs, earthquakes, and streams of molten
lava threaten before you enter a misty tunnel deep in the bowels of a vol-
cano. When you emerge into a giant space that looks like a NASA control
room, a 70mm film projected on a massive 210-foot wraparound screen
depicts the challenges of the world’s increasing energy demands and the
emerging technologies that will help meet them. The show ends on an
upbeat note — a vision of an energy-abundant future and Ellen as a new
Jeopardy! champion. The ride itself is a bit slow moving (literally), but
the bits featuring Ellen are funny, and it’s a good place to escape the
heat. Younger kids may find brief parts of the film a bit intense and the
fleeting appearance of the dinosaurs a tad too lifelike.
Wonders of Life Pavilion
The focus of the Wonders of Life Pavilion (you can’t miss the giant DNA
strand that marks its entrance) is on health and biology.
The Making of Me, starring Martin Short, is a 15-minute film combining
live action with animation and spectacular in utero photography to
create a sweet introduction to the facts of life. Short travels back in time
to witness his parents as children, their meeting at a college dance, their
wedding, and their decision to have a baby. Alongside him, Making of Me
visitors view his development inside the womb and witness his birth.
The presentation may prompt some pointed questions from young 
children — if you’re not ready to answer them, think about heading
them off and heading elsewhere; I recommend it for ages 10 and older.
Didn’t get your fill of being shrunk at the Imagination! Pavilion? Haven’t
been shaken up enough on a simulator? Try Body Wars, where you’re
reduced to the size of a cell for a rescue mission inside a human’s
immune system (it reminds many sci-fi fans of the Isaac Asimov classic
Chapter 13: Epcot 209

novel Fantastic Voyage). This motion-simulator takes you on a wild ride
through gale-force winds in the lungs and pounding heart chambers. It’s
nowhere near as cool as the similar Star Tours attraction at Disney–
MGM Studios (see Chapter 14), but it’s still fun.
Engineers designed this ride from the last row of the car, so that’s the
best place to sit to get the most bang for your buck. Riders must be at
least 40 inches tall to climb aboard.
In the hilarious Cranium Command, Buzzy, an animatronic brain-pilot-
in-training in the Cranium Commando Squad, is charged with the daunt-
ing task of controlling the brain of Bobby, a 12-year-old boy, during
adolescent traumas that include meeting a girl and a run-in with the
principal. The audience is seemingly seated inside Bobby’s head as
Buzzy guides him through his day — and gets chewed out every now
and then by his animated C.O., General Knowledge. Well-known actors
and comedians, including Charles Grodin, Jon Lovitz, and Dana Carvey,
play the boy’s body parts. This must-see attraction has a very loyal fan
following and is good for all ages.
Don’t skip the very funny pre-show film at this attraction — it sets up
the action that happens inside.
At the Fitness Fairgrounds, you can have your tennis, golf, or baseball
swing analyzed by experts. You can also get a computer-generated eval-
uation of your health habits or ride the exercycles, touring through
Disney via video.
The entire Wonders of Life Pavilion began opening on only a limited
schedule (mostly during peak crowds to alleviate long lines on other
rides) in January 2004, prompting speculation that a new exhibit may be
installed here within the next few years. Alas, to this day it remains life-
less much of the year.
Traveling through the World Showcase
The World Showcase is enjoyed mainly by adults or older kids with an
appreciation of world history and cultural shows. Its 11 miniature
nations, each re-created with meticulous detail, open at 11 a.m. daily and
surround the park’s 40-acre lagoon. All the showcase’s countries have
authentically indigenous architecture, landscaping, background music,
restaurants, and shops. The nations’ cultural facets are explored in art
exhibits, song-and-dance performances, and innovative rides, films, and
attractions. And all the employees at each of the pavilions are natives of
the country represented.
Most of these nations offer some kind of live entertainment throughout
the day. You may see acrobats, bagpipers, mariachi bands, storytellers,
belly dancers, and stilt walkers among other unique and interesting acts.
Characters regularly appear in the Showcase Plaza. When you enter 
the park, check your Times Guide and New Information brochure for
Part IV: Exploring Walt Disney World 
210

showtimes. You can also find schedules posted near the entrance to
each country.
Those with kids should grab a copy of the Epcot Kids’ Guide at Guest
Relations upon entering the park; it uses a K in a red square to note
Kidcot Fun Stops inside the World Showcase. These play and learning
stations are for the younger set and allow them to stop at various World
Showcase countries, do crafts, get autographs, have Kidcot passports
stamped (these are available for purchase in most Epcot stores and
make a great souvenir), and chat with cast members native to those
countries. Your kids will get the chance to learn about different coun-
tries and make a souvenir to bring home. For more information, stop in
at Guest Relations when you get into the park. The Kidcot Fun Stop sta-
tions open at 1 p.m. daily.
Finally, excellent shopping and dining opportunities are available at all
the pavilions. For details on dining inside the World Showcase, see
Chapter 10; you can find shopping information in Chapter 17.
Canada Pavilion
The pavilion’s highlight attraction is O Canada! — a dazzling, 18-minute,
360-degree CircleVision film that shows Canada’s scenic wonders, from
sophisticated Montréal to the thundering flight of thousands of snow
geese departing the St. Lawrence River.
The theater has no seats and you stand for the entire production
(though there are lean rails).
The architecture and landscape in the Canada Pavilion include a
mansard-roofed replica of Ottawa’s 19th-century Château Laurier (here
called the Hôtel du Canada) and an Indian village complete with 30-foot
replicas of Ojibwa totem poles. The Canadian wilderness is reflected by
a rocky mountain (really made of concrete and chicken wire); a waterfall
cascading into a white-water stream; and a mini forest of evergreens,
stately cedars, maples, and birch trees. Don’t miss the stunning floral
display inspired by Victoria’s world-renowned Butchart Gardens. Off
Kilter entertains visitors with New Age Celtic music.
China Pavilion
You enter Epcot’s version of China through a triple-arched ceremonial
gate inspired by the Temple of Heaven in Beijing, a summer retreat for
Chinese emperors. Passing through the gate, you’ll see a half-size replica
of this ornately embellished red-and-gold circular temple, built in 1420
during the Ming Dynasty. Gardens simulate those at Suzhou, with minia-
ture waterfalls, lotus ponds, and bamboo groves.
Inside the temple, you can watch Reflections of China, a 20-minute, 360-
degree CircleVision film that explores the culture and landscapes in and
around seven Chinese cities. It visits Beijing, Shanghai, and the Great
Wall (begun 24 centuries ago!), among other places.
Chapter 13: Epcot 211

Like Canada, the theater here has no seats and you stand for the entire
production (though there are lean rails).
Land of Many Faces is an exhibit that introduces China’s ethnic peoples,
and entertainment is provided daily by the amazing Dragon Legend
Acrobats. Other entertainment includes the authentic instrumental
sounds of SI XIAN.
France Pavilion
This pavilion focuses on France’s Belle Epoque (Beautiful Age) — the
period from 1870 to 1910 — when art, literature, and architecture ruled.
You enter via a replica of the beautiful cast-iron Pont des Arts footbridge
over the Seine and find yourself in a park with bleached sycamores,
Bradford pear trees, flowering crape myrtle, and sculptured parterre
flower gardens inspired by Seurat’s painting A Sunday Afternoon on the
Island of La Grande Jatte. The grounds also include a 1/10-scale model of
the Eiffel Tower, which was built from Gustave Eiffel’s original blueprints.
The premiere attraction here is Impressions de France. Shown in the
palatial Palais du Cinema, a sit-down theater a la Fontainebleau, this 18-
minute film is a journey through diverse French landscapes projected on
a vast, 200-degree wraparound screen. Outside, grab a French pastry
and watch the antics of Serveur Amusant, a comedic waiter, or the
visual comedy of Le Mime Roland.
Germany Pavilion
Enclosed by castle walls, Germany offers ’wursts, oompah bands, and a
rollicking atmosphere. The clock tower in the central platz (plaza) is
embellished with a glockenspiel that heralds each hour with quaint
melodies. The Biergarten Restaurant was inspired by medieval
Rothenberg, while 16th-century building facades replicate a merchant’s
hall in the Black Forest and the town hall in Frankfurt’s Römerberg Square.
If you’re a model-train fanatic or visiting with young kids, don’t miss the
exquisitely detailed version of a small Bavarian town, complete with
working train station, located between Germany and Italy.
Italy Pavilion
Italy lures visitors over an arched stone footbridge to a replica of
Venice’s intricately ornamented pink-and-white Doge’s Palace. Other
architectural highlights include the 83-foot Campanile (bell tower) of St.
Mark’s Square, Venetian bridges, and a piazza enclosing a version of
Bernini’s Neptune Fountain. A garden wall suggests a backdrop of
provincial countryside, and citrus, cypress, pine, and olive trees frame a
formal garden. Gondolas are moored on the lagoon.
In the street entertainment department, Sergio, a mime juggler, fasci-
nates visitors young and old daily. You can also see the hilarious World
Part IV: Exploring Walt Disney World 
212

Showcase Players, who, at press time, were seen spoofing Shakespeare’s
Italian-set Taming of the Shrew.
Japan Pavilion
A flaming red torii (gate of honor) on the banks of the lagoon and the
graceful blue-roofed Goju No To pagoda, inspired by an 8th-century
shrine built at Nara, welcome you to the Japan pavilion, which focuses
on Japan’s ancient culture. If you have some leisure time, enjoy the
exquisitely cultivated Japanese garden — it’s a haven of tranquility in a
place that’s anything but, and 90 percent of the plants you see are actu-
ally native to Japan. The Shishinden, inspired by the ceremonial and
coronation hall found in the Imperial Palace grounds at Kyoto, is home
to the Mitsukoshi Department Store (discussed in Chapter 17). The
Bijutsu-kan Gallery offers rotating exhibits ranging from 18th-century
Bunraki puppets to Japanese baseball.
Make sure that you include a performance of traditional Taiko drumming
by Matsuriza, which entertains guests daily. Japanese storytellers offer
up native tales every now and then.
Mexico Pavilion
The music of mariachi bands greets you at Mexico’s festive showcase,
fronted by a Mayan pyramid modeled on the Aztec temple of
Quetzalcoatl (God of Life) and surrounded by dense Yucatán jungle land-
scaping. Just inside the pavilion’s entrance, a museum exhibits rare
Oaxacan wood sculptures. Also inside the pyramid you’ll find an open-
air marketplace filled with artisans peddling their wares under the star-
filled skies above (it’s always nighttime here) behind which is El Rio del
Tiempo (River of Time), an eight-minute cruise through Mexico’s past
and present (the audio-animatronic dolls you encounter en-route may
remind you of those in the Magic Kingdom’s “it’s a small world”). Along
the river route, passengers get a close-up look at the Mayan pyramid
and the erupting Popocatepetl volcano.
Mariachi Cobre, a 12-piece mariachi ensemble, performs Tuesday
through Saturday.
Morocco Pavilion
A replica of the world famous Koutoubia Minaret, the prayer tower of a
12th-century mosque in Marrakech, overlooks the very atmospheric
pavilion of Morocco, featuring the architectural styles of several cities
inside the North African kingdom. The exotic ambience is enhanced by
geometrically patterned tile work, hand-painted wood ceilings, and
brass lighting fixtures. The Medina (old city), entered via a replica of an
arched gateway in Fez, leads to a traditional Moroccan home and the
narrow, winding streets of the souk, a bustling marketplace where
authentic handicrafts are on display. The Medina’s courtyard centers on
a replica of the ornately tiled Najjarine Fountain in Fez.
Chapter 13: Epcot 213

The Gallery of Arts and History contains ever-changing exhibits of
Moroccan art. A guided tour of the pavilion, Treasures of Morocco,
runs three times daily. (Check your Times Guide and New Information
brochure for show schedules.) Speaking of shows, the band Mo’Rockin’
kicks things up with Arabian rock music.
Norway Pavilion
The Norway Pavilion’s stave church, located off a charming cobblestone
plaza, and styled after the 13th-century Gol Church of Hallingdal, fea-
tures changing exhibits focusing on Norwegian art and culture. A replica
of Oslo’s 14th-century Akershus Castle is the setting for the pavilion’s
restaurant, Akershus Royal Banquet Hall (see Chapter 10). Other build-
ings simulate the red-roofed cottages of Bergen and the timber-sided
farm buildings of the Nordic woodlands.
Norway includes a two-part attraction. Maelstrom, a boat ride in a
dragon-headed Viking vessel, travels Norway’s fjords and mythical
forests to the music of Peer Gynt. Along the way, you see polar bears
prowling the shore and you are turned into frogs by trolls that cast a
spell on your boat. The watercraft crashes through a narrow gorge (two
small separate drops) and spins into the North Sea, where a storm is in
progress. (Don’t worry — this is a relatively calm ride, though some of
the thunder elements may frighten the very young.) The storm abates, a
princess’s kiss turns you into a human again, and you disembark to a
10th-century Viking village to view the 70mm film Norway, highlighting
history and culture (you can proceed through the theater to the exit if
you don’t want to watch the film).
To the left of the Stave Church stands a large wooden Viking ship where
kids can climb and run about, expending their extra energy. On the
entertainment front, SPELMANNS GLEDJE plays lively Norwegian folk
music.
United Kingdom Pavilion
The United Kingdom Pavilion evokes Merry Olde England through its
Britannia Square — a London-style park complete with copper-roofed
gazebo bandstand, a stereotypical red phone booth (it really works!), an
old-fashioned pub, a thatched cottage, and a statue of the Bard. Four
centuries of architecture — from the Tudor era all the way through the
English Regency period — line cobblestone streets. In the horticulture
department, there’s a formal garden with low box hedges in geometric
patterns, and the flagstone paths and a stone fountain replicate the land-
scaping of 16th- and 17th-century palaces.

Don’t miss the British Invasion, a group that impersonates the Beatles;
vivacious pub pianist Pam Brody; and Jason Wethington, a pub magi-
cian who offers up Disney magic of the sleight-of-hand variety.
U.S.A. Pavilion
This flagship pavilion’s main building is a 108,000-square-foot Georgian
mansion and occupies the central spot in the World Showcase. Notable
U.S. landmarks that inspired Disney’s Imagineers in the design of the
building include Independence Hall, Monticello, and Colonial
Williamsburg. The action takes place in an elegant colonial-style 1,024-
seat theater loaded with Corinthian columns, chandeliers, and 12 marble
statues symbolizing the 12 “Spirits of America.” The flags you pass
under as you enter the theater — 44 in all — include every one that has
flown over the United States throughout its history.
The actual production, a 29-minute CliffsNotes version of U.S. history,
utilizes a 72-foot rear-projection screen, rousing music, and a large cast
of lifelike audio-animatronic figures, including narrators Mark Twain and
Ben Franklin. You follow the voyage of the Mayflower, watch Jefferson
writing the Declaration of Independence, and witness Matthew Brady
photographing a family that the Civil War is about to divide. You can also
witness Pearl Harbor and the Eagle going to the moon. Teddy Roosevelt
discusses the need for national parks; Susan B. Anthony speaks out on
women’s rights; Frederick Douglass discusses slavery; and Chief Joseph
talks about the plight of Native Americans. It’s one of Disney’s best his-
torical productions.
Entertainment includes the Spirit of America Fife & Drum Corps and
the Voices of Liberty a cappella group, which sings patriotic songs in
the lobby of the main theater between shows. Large-scale outdoor pro-
ductions are often staged in the America Gardens Theatre, a 1,800-seat
outdoor venue across from the main pavilion building.
Ending your day at Epcot
Epcot’s end-of-day celebration, IllumiNations: Reflections of Earth, is a
moving blend of fireworks, lasers, and fountains in a display that’s signa-
ture Disney. The show is worth the crowds that flock to the parking lot
when it’s over.
You can find tons of good viewing points around the lagoon (one excel-
lent spot is the terrace at the Rose & Crown Dining Room in the United
Kingdom — see Chapter 10 for more on the place). That said, it’s best to
stake your claim at least a half-hour or so before showtime, which is
listed in your Times Guide and New Information brochure.

D
isney touts Disney–MGM Studios as “the Hollywood that never was
and always will be.” Its movie- and TV-themed shows and props 
set the stage, so to speak, but this little park is also home to two of the
biggest thrill rides in Orlando — Twilight Zone Tower of Terror and
Rock ’n’ Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith. Its neighborhoods include
Hollywood and Sunset boulevards, where Art Deco movie sets evoke the
Golden Age of Hollywood. Streets of America is lined with miniature ren-
ditions of the cityscapes of New York City and San Francisco, including
re-creations of actual city streets and buildings. You can find some of the
best street performing in the Disney parks here. More importantly, it’s a
working movie and TV studio where shows are occasionally produced.
The Lights, Motors, Action! Extreme Stunt Show lets you experience
the thrills of a high-speed chase and other dramatic movie stunts, as
well as gives you insight into how such effects are created, designed,
and filmed for the movies.
Unlike the Magic Kingdom and Epcot, you can pretty much see Disney–
MGM’s 154 acres of attractions relatively easily in a single day — that is,
if you arrive reasonably early and keep up a brisk pace. If you don’t get a
Disney–MGM Studios Guidemap and Times Guide and New Information
brochure as you enter the park, be sure to grab one at Guest Relations.
Check showtimes in the Times Guide and New Information brochure as
soon as you arrive and come up with an entertainment schedule that
works for you. Likewise, take a second to plan ahead for mealtimes and
make your Advanced Dining Reservations immediately if you haven’t
already; many of the park’s rather unique restaurants fill up quickly.

Acquainting Yourself with 
Disney–MGM Studios
Before I head off for a closer look at the park’s rides and attractions, I
must first deal with some mundane matters that you may very well
appreciate after you’re there:
Buying tickets and making reservations
Admission prices to Disney–MGM are $67 for a one-day adult ticket, $56
for children ages 3 to 9. See Chapter 11 for other ticket options.
Tickets aren’t the only thing you spend your hard-earned money on. The
prices of consumables are pretty much standard among Disney parks.
Disney–MGM Studios nails you to the tune of $2 or more for a soda or
milk, $1.25 to $2.50 for bottled water, $2.50 for an ice-cream bar, and
$1.70 (and up) for a cup of coffee.
If you haven’t made Advanced Dining Reservations before you arrive
by calling % 407-939-3463 (the preferred course of action), do so the
minute you enter the park if you care to eat a sit-down meal at one of the
park’s unique dining venues. See Chapter 10 for details on Disney–MGM’s
best restaurants.
Park hours are generally from 9 a.m. to 6 or 7 p.m., with extended hours —
sometimes as late as 10 p.m. — during holidays and summer.
Locating special services and facilities
In case you forgot to bring essential items, or if you need special assis-
tance while at the park, here’s a list of services and facilities that may
come in handy:
 ATMs accept cards from banks using Cirrus, STAR, and PLUS and
are located to the right of the main entrance and next to Toy Story
Pizza Planet, across from Muppet Vision 3-D.
 The Baby Care Center is to the left of the main entrance and
includes places for nursing and changing. You can buy disposable
diapers, formula, baby food, and pacifiers. Changing tables also are
in all women’s restrooms and some men’s rooms.
 You can find disposable cameras and film throughout the park,
although digital camera supplies are extremely limited.
 The First Aid Station, staffed by registered nurses, is in the Entrance
Plaza adjoining Guest Relations.
 Lockers are located near Oscar’s Classic Car Souvenirs, to the right
of the entrance. They cost $7 a day, including a $2 refundable
deposit.

Pitting Disney–MGM Studios Against
Universal Studios Florida
If you love the movies, Broadway-style productions, or the Golden Age 
of Hollywood, you’ll enjoy wandering the streets, shops, and sets of
Disney–MGM Studios. Universal Studios Florida (see Chapter 18) caters
to visitors with children more than in years past, thanks to Fievel’s
Playland and the other attractions in Woody Woodpecker’s KidZone.
But is this town big enough for two studios? Both offer unique experi-
ences and a flair all their own, so if you can swing it, it’s well worth your
time to experience both. I genuinely feel for the visitor who has time to
visit only one of these stellar parks.
Both have a variety of good shows and, alas, unavoidably long lines.
Universal has an edge in the number and diversity of rides, but MGM’s
Twilight Zone Tower of Terror is, arguably, the best thrill ride in either
park (even with the addition of Universal’s Revenge of the Mummy the
Ride), and Rock ’n’ Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith is nothing to
sneeze at either. Universal is larger, which means you wear out more
shoe leather, but it isn’t as congested.
My overall evaluation is that MGM Studios has some great shows (many
of which geared to tinier tots) and rides, mainly Lights, Motors, Action!
Extreme Stunt Show, the Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular!, the
Twilight Zone Tower of Terror, Star Tours — The Ultimate Star Wars
Thrill Ride, Muppet Vision 3-D, and the Disney–MGM Studios Backlot
Tour, but I give Universal a microscopic edge.
Part IV: Exploring Walt Disney World 
220

The following sections divide attractions in Disney–MGM Studios into
two categories. Rides and shows rated G will assuredly entertain the
youngest visitors and, in many cases, the older ones as well. PG-rated
rides are those geared toward adults and teens (and may bore or
frighten children). For a look at the park, turn to the “Disney–MGM
Studios” map on page 219.
Entertaining the Whole Family: 
G-Rated Attractions and Rides
Rides and attractions listed in this category are suitable for everyone,
although a few may not appeal to teens or adults.
Beauty and the Beast — Live on Stage
A 1,500-seat, covered amphitheater provides the stage for this 30-minute,
live production of Beauty and the Beast, adapted from the movie version.
Musical highlights include the rousing “Be Our Guest” opening number
and the poignant title song featured in a romantic waltz-scene finale. Sets
and costumes are lavish, and the production numbers are spectacular.
Arrive early to get a good seat. The park usually hosts four or five shows
a day.
“Honey, I Shrunk the Kids” Movie Set Adventure
In this 11,000-square-foot playground, everything is larger than life. A
thicket of grass is 30 feet tall, mushroom caps are three stories high, and
a friendly ant makes a suitable seat. Play areas include a massive cream
cookie, a 52-foot garden hose with leaks, cereal loops 9 feet wide and
cushioned for jumping, and a waterfall cascading from a leaf to a dell of
fern sprouts. (The sprouts form a musical stairway, activated when you
step from sprout to sprout.) There’s also a root maze with a flower-petal
slide, a filmstrip slide in a giant film canister, and a huge spider web with
11 levels. This attraction is a great place for children ages 2 to 8 to work
off their excess energy, while you regain some of your sanity.
Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular!
Spectacular barely begins to describe this 35-minute rock ’em, sock ’em
extravaganza guaran-double-teed to keep you entertained and on the
edge of your seat. The show is held in a big, open-air stadium and
recruits a handful of adult volunteers to help out. It begins with Indy rap-
pelling down from the rafters, and the amazing special effects soon have
him dodging spikes, falling into a pit of molten something-or-other, sur-
viving two ax-wielding gargoyles, grabbing a priceless amulet, and then
outrunning fire, steam, and a tremendous boulder that nearly flattens
him. The actors, special-effects folks, and director use the breaks to
explain what you just saw or are about to see, including stunt secrets. In
later scenes, Indy battles the evil Nazis in a Cairo marketplace and at an
Chapter 14: Disney–MGM Studios 221

airport-munitions dump. Shots are fired and flames are bursting all
around the set. 
The closer to the front of the theater you are, the more likely you are to
feel the extreme heat from the explosions, so if you have young kids
along you may want to sit a few rows back.
“It looked just like the movie — how cool is that!” It’s definitely an adren-
aline booster, though loud noises and moments of violence (which are
really quite mild when compared to today’s movie standards) may make
this show a little too intense for kids under 5. There usually are five or
six shows a day.
Journey Into Narnia: Creating The Lion, 
The Witch and The Wardrobe
Disney’s newest attraction takes you on a journey through the wardrobe
to the wintry world of Narnia for a behind-the-scenes look at how this
blockbuster film was made. You’ll walk through a frozen landscape amidst
towering snow-capped pines, a replica of the famous lamp post to light
the way lying just ahead of you (just as it did in the movie). Even the
White Witch makes an appearance, albeit momentarily, before you exit
through the gallery housing elaborate costumes, suits of armor, story-
boards, props, creatures, and other movie memorabilia used in making
the film. Although this small attraction doesn’t make the top of my must-
see list, it’s worth the wait to walk through the wardrobe.
Lights, Motors, Action! Extreme Stunt Show
Inspired by the popular Stunt Show Spectacular at Disneyland Paris, 
this high-octane stunt show takes places on the set of a spy thriller in
progress, with a quaint Mediterranean village as the backdrop. The show
features specially designed stunt cars, motorcycles, and jet skis, plus
some rather amazing special effects and even more spectacular driving —
with an audience member pulled in for a bit of the fun. Much like the
Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular! (see above), insiders reveal industry
secrets, detailing how stunts are created, designed, and filmed for the
movies. Filmed images are shown on an oversized screen, illustrating how
the use of different camera angles can add drama to filmed scenes.
Seating is in a large outdoor stadium with a degree of cover from the
sun, but a late-afternoon show may be the best way to avoid the direct
rays and heat. The only bad seats in the house are the few rows in the
center just above an entry to the set used by some of the vehicles. Make
note that this one gets loud . . . Loud . . . LOUD! Children under 3 may
not tolerate the revving engines and explosions well.
The Magic of Disney Animation
This tour opens with a live artist interacting with Mushu from Disney’s
Mulan and a cute video on the making of that film. Alas, Disney’s real-life
Part IV: Exploring Walt Disney World 
222

Florida animators were all laid off in 2004, so the inspection of their
former working quarters strikes a somewhat sour chord. The tour ends
on an up note, however, as visitors attempt their own Disney character
drawings under the supervision of a working animator. Just before exit-
ing, be sure to have the kids head to an animation station. The short
computerized program photographs your children’s faces and asks a few
questions to determine which Disney character they’re most like.
Muppet Vision 3-D
This must-see production stars Kermit and Miss Piggy in a delightful
marriage of Jim Henson’s puppets and Disney audio-animatronics, spe-
cial-effects wizardry, 70mm film, and cutting-edge 3-D technology. The
action takes place in a pretty-darn-accurate reproduction of the theater
you probably grew up watching on TV. In the show, you encounter flying
Muppets, cream pies, cannonballs, high winds, fiber-optic fireworks,
bubble showers, and even an actual spray of water. Kermit is host, Miss
Piggy sings “Dream a Little Dream of Me,” Statler and Waldorf heckle 
the action from the balcony, and Nicki Napoleon and his Emperor
Penguins (a full Muppet orchestra) provide music from the pit. Kids of
all ages will enjoy this whimsical attraction and adults will be just as
delighted. The 25-minute show (including a 12-minute video pre-show)
runs continuously.
Playhouse Disney — Live on Stage!
Younger audiences (2–8 years old) love this 20-minute show, where they
meet characters from Bear in the Big Blue House, The Book of Pooh, JoJo’s
Circus, and other favorite Disney stories. The show encourages preschool-
ers to dance, sing, and play along with the cast. It happens several times
daily. Check your Times Guide and New Information brochure for show
schedules.
Sounds Dangerous — Starring Drew Carey
Drew Carey (on film) provides laughs while dual-audio technology pro-
vides some incredible hair-raising effects during a 12-minute mixture of
movie and live action at ABC Sound Studios. You feel like you’re right in
the middle of the action of a TV pilot featuring undercover police work
and plenty of amusing mishaps. Even when the picture disappears, you
continue the chase via headphones that demonstrate “3-D” sound effects
such as a roomful of angry bees, a herd of galloping elephants, and a
deafening auto race.
Most of the show takes place in total darkness, and the sound and sen-
sory effects may be frightening to younger ears, so think twice before
bringing children under 6.
Chapter 14: Disney–MGM Studios 223

Voyage of the Little Mermaid
Hazy lighting helps paint a picture of an underwater world in a 17-minute
show that combines live performances, movie clips, puppetry, and spe-
cial effects. Sebastian sings “Under the Sea,” Ariel performs “Part of Your
World,” and the evil Ursula, 12 feet tall and 10 feet wide, belts out “Poor
Unfortunate Soul.” The Voyage has some scary scenes, but most little
kids don’t mind because, just like the movie, they know the show has a
happy ending. You get spritzed with water during the show, making this
an especially good experience during hot days.
Exploring PG-Rated Attractions and Rides
Rides and attractions in this category appeal to older children and
adults. In some cases, they have age, height, or health restrictions —
most of them well deserved.
The American Film Institute Showcase
More of a shop than anything, the showcase includes an exhibit area
where you can waltz through Hollywood history, learning about the folks
behind the movies — editors, cinematographers, producers, and direc-
tors whose names roll by in the blur of credits. It also spotlights some of
the institute’s lifetime-achievement winners, including Bette Davis, Jack
Nicholson, and Elizabeth Taylor. A special exhibit here, Villains: Movie
Characters You Love to Hate, features the costumes and props of sev-
eral notable bad guys, including Darth Vader.
Disney–MGM Studios Backlot Tour
This fun, 35-minute special-effects show starts on foot and finishes in a
tram. You get a behind-the-scenes look at the vehicles, props, costumes,
sets, and special effects used in some of your favorite movies and TV
shows. On most days, you see costume makers at work in the wardrobe
department (the largest of its kind, with around 2 million garments). But
the real fun begins when the tram heads for Catastrophe Canyon, where
an earthquake in the heart of oil country causes canyon walls to rumble.
A raging oil fire, massive explosions, torrents of rain, and flash floods
threaten you and other riders before you’re taken behind the scenes to
see how filmmakers use special effects to make such disasters.
Groans at the thought of enduring a tour of the backlot gave way to
screams after Ryan (13), Austin (11), and Nicolas (9) experienced
Catastrophe Canyon, where the “earthquake” shook the tram and a 
very large, very wet wave threw 70,000 gallons of water our way.
All in all, this ride is very similar in type to Earthquake — The Big One
at Universal Studios Florida (see Chapter 18). Sit on the left side of the
tram if you want to get wet.
Part IV: Exploring Walt Disney World 
224

The Great Movie Ride
Set inside a replica of Los Angeles’s famous Grauman’s Chinese Theatre,
this 22-minute journey down MGM’s memory lane starts in the 1930s 
and moves forward from there, using lifelike audio-animatronic versions
of famous actors to re-create some memorable movie moments. The
line/waiting area features film clips from various classic films, and sev-
eral cinematic artifacts to gawk at, including a set of Dorothy’s ruby 
slippers from The Wizard of Oz. Then, you’re off to watch Bogey say
goodbye to Bergman, Tarzan (the Johnny Weismuller version) swing
through the jungle, James Cagney act tough, and Gene Kelly dance —
and sing — in the rain. A live outlaw enhances the action when he kid-
naps you and your mates, but — revenge is so sweet, isn’t it? — he goes
the wrong way, hopping onto a set that has an uncanny resemblance to
one in Raiders of the Lost Ark. After a narrow escape from the space
thing from Alien, your bank-robbing buddy gets incinerated when he
tries to steal the sphinx’s jewel. You survive to follow the yellow brick
road to Oz, where a remarkable likeness of the witch warns, “I’ll get you
my pretty, ahahahaha!”
Even though this ride was recently refurbished, the older kids expressed
zero interest in it, so we split up. They headed for the heart-pounding
thrills down on Hollywood Boulevard while my two youngest (ages 5 
and 7) and I enjoyed the slow-moving trip (with a brief moment or two 
of excitement thrown in for good measure) through Tinseltown. Movie
buffs and nostalgic adults will love it.
Rock ’n’ Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith
It takes a lot to really wow anyone anymore, but this ride is sure to do
the trick. This inverted roller coaster is one of the best thrill rides that
WDW has to offer, definitely not a ride for younger kids or anyone with
neck or back problems, faint hearts, a tendency toward motion sickness,
or fear of the dark.
Rock ’n’ Roller Coaster is a fast-and-furious indoor ride that puts you 
in a 24-passenger stretch limo, outfitted with 120 speakers that blare
Aerosmith at 32,000 watts! A flashing light warns you to “prepare to merge
as you’ve never merged before,” and faster than you can scream “Stop the
music!” (around 2.8 seconds, actually), you shoot from 0 to 60 mph and
into the first gut-tightening inversion at 5Gs. The ride’s beginning is a real
test of your courage as you blast into a wild journey through a make-
believe California freeway system. One inversion cuts through an O in the
Hollywood sign, but you won’t feel that you’re going to be thrown out
because the ride’s too fast and too smooth for that. It’s so fast, the Disney
hype says, that it’s similar to sitting atop an F-14 Tomcat. The ride lasts 
3 minutes and 12 seconds, the running time of Aerosmith’s hit, “Sweet
Emotion,” which is one of the tunes played in the limos. Similar to Space
Mountain, the entire ride takes place indoors and in the dark, but this one
packs far more of a punch.
Chapter 14: Disney–MGM Studios 225

Riders must be at least 48 inches tall. Plus-size guests with larger chests
may not be able to pull the shoulder harness fully closed and, therefore,
may not be able to ride this. People with sensitive ears should probably
bring earplugs for this ride.
“Lets do it again!” 9-year-old Nicolas screamed while playing air guitar.
Austin (age 11) screamed back in agreement. I wasn’t sure if they were
screaming from the excitement or as a result of the loud music being
pumped from the speaker behind their heads on the ride.
Star Tours — The Ultimate Star Wars Thrill Ride
Star Tours, like the slightly lesser Body Wars at Epcot (see Chapter 13),
is a virtual ride where you go nowhere, but you feel like you do. Your
journey to a place far, far away begins with a pre-ride warning about high
turbulence, sharp drops, and sudden turns, and a winding walk (a line)
through the woodlands, where you see an Ewok village in the trees over-
head and a humungous Imperial Walker standing guard near the entry.
The pre-ride has R2-D2 and C-3PO running a galactic travel agency of
sorts. After boarding your StarSpeeder, the ride itself starts kind of slow,
but it finishes fast as you soar through space as the good-guy fighter,
with R2-D2 and C-3PO helping you make passes through the canals of a
Death Star. The special effects include hitting hyperspace speed (you
feel like you’re going up against a very small G-force) and falling. All
things considered, though, this ride isn’t quite up to modern rides here
and at Orlando’s other theme parks, including Back to the Future The
Ride at USF (see Chapter 18), but it’s still highly enjoyable. Sit in the last
row to feel the motion best. If you feel a twinge of motion sickness, there
are plenty of stationary objects you can look at to get your bearings.
“That was so awesome!” Austin (11), a huge Star Wars fan, was definitely
impressed. It’s not nearly as threatening or active as the Rock ’n’ Roller
Coaster Starring Aerosmith, but Star Tours still carries a 40-inch height
minimum.
The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror
A truly stomach-lifting (and -dropping) ride, Disney continues to fine-
tune the Tower of Terror to make it even better. That includes an
upgrade that added random drop sequences, meaning you get a different
fright every time you ride. Its legend says that during a violent storm on
Halloween night 1939, lightning struck the Hollywood Tower Hotel, caus-
ing an entire wing and an elevator full of people to disappear. And you’re
about to meet them as you star in a special episode of The Twilight Zone
(cue that television show’s famously creepy music). En route to this for-
merly grand hotel, guests walk past overgrown landscaping and faded
signs that once pointed the way to stables and tennis courts; the vines
above the entrance trellis are dead, and the hotel is a crumbling ruin.
Eerie corridors lead to a dimly lit library, where you can hear a storm
raging outside. The detailing on this ride is some of the best around.
Part IV: Exploring Walt Disney World 
226

After various ghostly apparitions, blasts of chilling air, and creepy expe-
riences, your ride ends in a dramatic climax: a terrifying 13-story fall into
The Twilight Zone! From there it’s anyone’s guess as to what happens
next — not even the bellhops operating the elevator know what the ride
is going to do. At 199 feet, it’s the tallest WDW attraction, and it’s a cut
(or two or three) above its rival Doctor Doom’s Fear Fall at Universal’s
Islands of Adventure (see Chapter 19).
“Absolutely the coolest ride ever!” 11-year-old Austin couldn’t get
enough riding over and over again, but my 9- and 13-year-olds wouldn’t
get near the ride. I have no way of knowing whether it was from the
screams coming from the building or the semi-green faces on a family
that came out as we were about to get in line. They aren’t alone, though:
One of the Disney Imagineers who helped design the attraction is too
afraid to ride his own creation. Note, however, that there were plenty of
other kids ready for more at the ride’s end. This ride carries a 40-inch
height minimum.
Who Wants to Be a Millionaire — Play It!
Forget about winning $1 million — it ain’t happening here — but contest-
ants can win points toward prizes ranging from collectible pins to a
leather jacket to a three-night cruise on a Disney cruise ship (see
Chapter 16 for more on Disney cruises). Based on the game show, the
theme-park version features the same dramatic music and lighting that
made the TV version so famous. Lifelines (such as asking the audience
or calling a stranger on two phones set up in the park) are available for
contestants who need a little help answering up to 15 multiple-choice
questions in the climb to the top. It’s great fun to play along, but you
soon realize it isn’t as easy as it looks when you’re under the gun. Games
run continuously in the 600-seat studio.
Unlike the TV show, the entire audience competes to get in the hot seat
by answering questions on keypads; the fastest to answer qualifying
questions become the contestants.
Taking Time Out for Fantastic 
Parades and Fireworks
In addition to its assortment of rides, Disney–MGM also offers its own
daily parade and an exceptional evening fireworks display.
Fantasmic!
It’s hard not to be in awe of the choreography, laser lights, and fireworks
that are the core of this 25-minute extravaganza held once — sometimes
twice — a night, weather permitting. Shooting comets, great balls of fire,
and animated fountains are among the many special effects that entrance
the audience. The cast includes 50 performers, a gigantic dragon, a huge
Chapter 14: Disney–MGM Studios 227

king cobra, and 1 million gallons of water. The entire show represents
Mickey’s dream, filled with fanciful songs and fantastic visuals. The
dream turns into a nightmare thanks to the mischievous magic of some 
of Disney’s more infamous villains. Surprisingly, much of the show is
rather dark, with foreboding music and frightening creatures, with
Mickey taking on some evil villains. The Magical Mouse triumphs, of
course, and the show ends on a festive note. Younger children may be
frightened.
If you want to avoid a real traffic jam after the show, arrive up to 60 min-
utes early and sit on the right (the theater empties right to left) side of
the amphitheater. When there are two shows per night, especially during
peak periods, finding a seat at the later show is usually easier.
At press time, Disney was offering preferred seating at the end-of-the-day
spectacular, Fantasmic!, along with a fixed-price dinner at one of Disney–
MGM’s sit-down restaurants. All you need to do is make Advanced Dining
Reservations (% 407-939-3463) and request the Fantasmic! package for
the Hollywood Brown Derby ($37 adults, $10 kids 3–11), Mama Melrose’s
Ristorante Italiano ($29 adults, $10 kids 3–11), or Hollywood & Vine ($23
adults, $11 kids 3–11). Note: You must tell the reservation agent you want
the Fantasmic! package. At the restaurant, you’ll get your line pass and
instructions on getting to the special entrance to the preferred-seating
area of the show.
Be aware that the prices above are for a fixed-price meal and don’t
include sales tax, tip, or alcoholic beverages; ordering off the menu
costs you more. The prices also don’t include a reserved seat at
Fantasmic! — only a pass that gets you into the preferred-seating area
(you must arrive at least 30 minutes in advance — a much shorter wait
than usual).
Disney’s Stars and Motor Cars Parade
This motorcade includes a fun, highly recognizable procession of Disney
characters and their chariots. The parade is popular enough that if you
decide to skip it, you can find far shorter lines at the park’s most popu-
lar rides and shows. (Check the parade schedule in your park map.)

D
isney’s fourth major park combines exotic animals, elaborate land-
scapes, and a handful of rides and shows to create yet another
reason why many WDW resort-goers don’t venture outside this World.
The $800-million park opened in 1998; its most recent land, Asia, was 
finished in 1999. It’s also home to the Animal Kingdom’s first and long-
awaited thrill ride. Expedition Everest — Legend of the Forbidden
Mountain debuted in 2006 and is a high-speed, coaster-like train ride
that travels through glaciers, waterfalls, and canyons, climaxing with an
encounter with the Yeti. Even with this and other smaller additions, and
although the park offers some unique experiences, an expedition here
requires only half (if you keep up a brisk pace) to three-quarters of a
day, leaving some visitors to believe there isn’t enough there to justify
the $67 admission charge per adult or $56 per child 3 to 9.
But don’t go canceling that safari vacation just yet. Animal Kingdom is a
theme park after all — even if the exotic wildlife can move out of your
view. It’s filled with some amazing experiences and some of the most
remarkable landscaping and architectural re-creations in all of Disney
(after Epcot’s World Showcase pavilions, that is). In this chapter, I give
you helpful information about Animal Kingdom and its marvels, as well
as basic info for visiting the park.
Finding Helpful Services in Animal Kingdom
Before trekking through the jungle of attractions at Animal Kingdom, you
need to know some basic information, key to your survival when on
safari about the park.
Buying tickets and making reservations
A one-day ticket costs $67 for adults, $56 for children 3 to 9. See

Animal Kingdom
Chapter 15: Disney’s Animal Kingdom 231

Tickets aren’t the only things to cut down on your cash. You’ll pay the
Disney park standard of $2 and up for a soda, $1.25 to $2.50 for bottled
water, $2.60 for an ice-cream bar, and $1.70 (and up) for a cup of coffee.
If you buy a soda, note that the park doesn’t provide lids or straws with
its fountain drinks. They’re not trying to make it difficult for you to walk
around with your soda — these items are banned because, in the hands
of litterbugs, they can become deadly to the wildlife. Another no-no:
chewing gum.
You can make Advanced Dining Reservations (see Chapter 10 for
details on call-ahead dining) at Guest Relations just inside the entrance,
though it’s best to make them in advance by calling % 407-939-3463.
Hours at Animal Kingdom are from 8 a.m. to 5 or 6 p.m., but they’re
sometimes extended to 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. (though it’s rare).
Locating special services and facilities
In case you forgot to bring essential items, or if you need special assis-
tance while at the park, here’s a list of services and facilities that may
come in handy:
 You can find ATMs in Animal Kingdom near Garden Gates Gifts to
the right of the park entrance and across from Chester and Hester’s
Dinosaur Treasures in DinoLand U.S.A. Cards from banks using the
Cirrus, STAR, and PLUS systems are accepted.
 The Baby Care Center is located near Creature Comforts on the
west side of the Tree of Life. As in the other Disney parks, you can
also find changing tables in women’s restrooms and some men’s
rooms. You can buy disposable diapers at Guest Relations.
 You can buy disposable cameras and film, as well as a limited
selection of digital supplies, throughout the park. CD-burning and
picture-printing services are available at KODAK Picture Kiosks and
select stores at all four Disney theme parks.
 The First Aid Station, which is staffed by registered nurses, is
located near Creature Comforts near the Tree of Life.
 Lockers are located in Garden Gate Gifts to your right as you enter
the park. You can also find them to the left, near Rainforest Café.
You can rent lockers for $7 a day, including a $2 deposit.
 A lost-children center is located near Creature Comforts by the
Tree of Life. This area also is the site of same-day lost and found.
Kids age 7 and younger should wear name tags pinned to the inside 
of their clothing.
 Shop clerks can send your packages (at no charge) to the front of
the park at Garden Gate Gifts. Allow three hours for delivery. If
you’re staying at a Disney resort, you can have your packages
shipped there, though they may take a day or two to get to the
resort.
Part IV: Exploring Walt Disney World 
232

 Pet-care facilities are just outside the park entrance to the right.
You can board your pet for $10 a day (% 407-824-6568). The Ticket
and Transportation Center at the Magic Kingdom has overnight
boarding available. Proof of vaccination is required.
 Rent strollers at Garden Gate Gifts, to the right as you enter the
park ($10 for a single, $18 for a double). Satellite locations are also
throughout the park. Ask a Disney employee to steer you in the
right direction.
 Rent wheelchairs at Garden Gate Gifts, on your right as you enter
the park. Rentals cost $10 for a standard wheelchair, and $35 (plus
a $5 deposit) for electric chairs. Ask Disney employees for other
locations in the park.
You can call % 407-934-7639 or visit Disney’s Web site (www.disney
world.com) to find out more about WDW properties.
Deciding Between Animal Kingdom 
and Busch Gardens
When Disney’s fourth theme park opened, it raised two questions: Is it a
first-rate park worthy of the same sticker shock as Orlando’s other major
parks, and when does the area have too many parks?
Well, when it comes to visitor volume and diversity of things to do,
Animal Kingdom ranks as one of the top two animal parks in Florida.
Busch Gardens ($58 per adult, $48 per child) in Tampa is the other.
Although I discuss Busch Gardens in Chapter 23, I talk about it briefly
here so that I can draw a few comparisons.
Animal Kingdom is as much a park for animals, a conservation venue, as
it is an attraction. The short of it is that its creatures aren’t as easy to
see; they’re given much more cover than at Busch Gardens, so when
they want to avoid your probing eyes and the heat, they can. Even in
high-profile areas, such as Pangani Forest Exploration Trail, Disney
goes to great lengths to protect resident lowland gorillas, including a
magnificent silverback, from prying eyes. The beautiful foliage used to
create that cover also means that Animal Kingdom is a lot prettier than
its Tampa rival.
Although I’m all for protecting wildlife, Animal Kingdom can do a much
better job of providing shade for the only species that doesn’t get much
consideration in the park — the Homo sapiens who paid to get in. The
amount of cover given to tourists waiting in line is decidedly unimpres-
sive (a problem in all of Disney’s parks, in my opinion). Arriving early at
both parks, especially in summer, saves you the unpleasant experience
of languishing under a blistering sun.
Chapter 15: Disney’s Animal Kingdom 233

The best time to catch the animals out and about at Animal Kingdom 
is in the early morning just after the park opens — usually 7 or 8 a.m.
(depending on the season) — or at closing as the day begins to cool.
Most animals are on the prowl at those times, not at midday (especially
during the summer). Busch’s animals are far easier to see, regardless of
the time of day, as they have far fewer places to take cover.
Animal Kingdom wins the battle of shows with humdingers such as
Festival of the Lion King. Although the Animal Kingdom has four thrill
rides (and I’m being kind in including two of them in the thrill category),
Busch Gardens pulls ahead with six roller coasters including SheiKra, an
incredible dive coaster, and Gwazi, a set of dueling wooden coasters.
By comparison, Busch comes out ahead when it comes to rides and
attractions, but it isn’t nearly as impressive in the categories of land-
scaping or themed architecture. New additions aside, many criticize
Animal Kingdom — fairly, in my opinion — for not offering enough to jus-
tify a ticket price comparable to Busch Gardens and the other Orlando
theme parks, although I appreciate the park more now that I’ve learned
to think of the surroundings, and not necessarily the attractions them-
selves, as the highlight of Animal Kingdom. But geographically speaking,
you may not have or want a choice between the two. Animal Kingdom is
located right in the center of the Orlando action, where you can find a
ton of other things to do. Alas, Busch Gardens is at least a 75-minute
drive or shuttle trip from O-Town, and the Tampa Bay area simply 
doesn’t have the draw of Orlando, though it does offer cultural centers,
museums, aquariums, and sandy beaches. If you’re considering a trip to
the Tampa Bay area, I recommend buying a copy of Florida For Dummies,
3rd Edition, by Lesley Abravanel, or Frommer’s Florida 2007, by Lesley
Abravanel and Laura Lea Miller (both published by Wiley); both books
have a wealth of information about attractions, accommodations, and
restaurants on the state’s Suncoast.
Checking Out Animal Kingdom’s 
Top Attractions
The overall conservation theme in this state-of-the-art park is simple but
not subtle. Everywhere you turn, you find an environmental message,
including the park’s signs and the narratives of the tour guides on rides
such as Kilimanjaro Safaris. It’s this underlying theme that connects the
park’s rather diverse sections, where you’ll encounter everything from a
dinosaur-themed thrill ride to a kid-friendly zone where Disney charac-
ters hang out.
Animal Kingdom, like WDW’s Magic Kingdom, is set up on a hub-and-
spoke format with the Tree of Life (in Discovery Island) as its hub and
five other sections scattered around it. The following sections provide
Part IV: Exploring Walt Disney World 
234

you with a closer look at the seven lands of Animal Kingdom. You can
find all the Kingdom’s attractions on the “Animal Kingdom” map on 
page 231.
Oasis
The Oasis Exhibits is your introduction to Animal Kingdom, but a lot of
folks, itching to get to the action, launch their way through it, overlooking
the fact that this is one of the better places to see not-so-rare animals
early in the day. The lush vegetation, streams, grottoes, and waterfalls on
either side of the walkway are good places to spot wallabies, miniature
deer, anteaters, sloths, iguanas, tree kangaroos, otters, and macaws. But
a misty fog and the landscaping also give them room to escape your eyes
whenever they choose.
Discovery Island
After you pass through Oasis, Discovery Island lies directly ahead, with
the park’s signature icon, the Tree of Life, in the center of it all. Although
you’ll find only three attractions in this land, they are among the park’s
most unique features.
Discovery Island Trails
Discovery Island Trails is another of the park’s animal-viewing areas, 
a leisurely path through the root system of the Tree of Life (Animal
Kingdom’s 145-foot man-made tree described in detail below) and a
chance to see real, but not-so-rare, critters such as axis deer, red kanga-
roos, otters, flamingos, lemurs, Galapagos tortoises, ducks, storks, and
cockatoos.
The best viewing times are early or late in the day, though I’d save this
one for later and head to the park’s few thrill rides first.
It’s Tough to Be a Bug!
Take the walkway through the Tree of Life’s 50-foot base, grab a pair of 
3-D glasses, and settle into a sometimes creepy-crawly seat. Based on
the Disney-Pixar film, A Bug’s Life, the special effects in this multimedia
adventure are pretty impressive. Although it may not be a good choice 
for kids younger than 4 (it’s dark and loud) or bug haters. The attraction
offers a fun and sometimes-poignant look at life from a smaller perspec-
tive. After you put on your bug-eye glasses, all your senses are awakened
by the stars, including ants, beetles, spiders, and — oh, no! — a stink bug.
I won’t say who, but more than one of my kids came out in tears, but for
reasons you may not expect. The simple sensory effects, mostly because
they occur unexpectedly and in the dark, terrorized even some of the
older ones. The issue my youngest had was with the bugs — he hates
them.
Chapter 15: Disney’s Animal Kingdom 235

On the other hand, Katie (a cousin), thought the show was “really funny.”
Viewers experience some spritzes of water, blasts of air, and a foul smell
when the stink bug gets its revenge. The show’s finale, when the on-screen
insects run amok, definitely leaves you buzzing.
The Tree of Life
Like Cinderella Castle at Magic Kingdom (see Chapter 12 for more
details) and Spaceship Earth in Epcot (described in Chapter 13), the 14-
story Tree of Life is a park icon. The man-made tree and its carved ani-
mals are the work of Disney artists, teams of which worked for more than
a year on its free-form animal sculptures. It isn’t as tall or imposing as
those other icons, but it is certainly impressive. It has 8,000 limbs, 103,000
leaves, and 325 mammals, reptiles, amphibians, insects, birds, dinosaurs,
and Mickeys carved into its trunk, limbs, and roots. Different animals
appear or vanish depending on the angle from which you view the tree.
Although passing up a detailed inspection of the tree as you enter the
park is hard to do (it is awesomely difficult to ignore), I recommend gawk-
ing only while standing in line for It’s Tough to Be a Bug! You’ll have time
for a more detailed look at the tree — if you so desire — on the way out.
Camp Minnie–Mickey
Youngsters love this place, though I don’t share their enthusiasm. It’s 
a favorite hangout for Disney characters from the forest and jungle,
including Simba from The Lion King and Baloo from The Jungle Book.
Mickey, Minnie, Goofy, Pluto, Donald, Daisy, and other stars also make
appearances from time to time around this woody retreat, which was
designed to resemble an Adirondack summer camp. The lines for the
meet-and-greets are often excruciatingly long, and unless the kids insist
on visiting, I recommend avoiding waiting to meet with Disney charac-
ters here.
In addition to the characters, this land is also home to Disney World’s
best stage show, Festival of the Lion King, an exhilarating and interac-
tive extravaganza.
Camp Minnie–Mickey Greeting Trails
If you’re traveling with children, this attraction is probably a must-do, but
be prepared for a long wait. A variety of Disney characters from Timon
and Winnie the Pooh to Pluto and Donald Duck shake your hand, give
hugs, allow photos to be taken, and sign autographs. Mickey and Minnie,
in recognition of their star status, get their own shaded pavilions.
Festival of the Lion King
This Broadway-style production at the Lion King Theater is the best in
Animal Kingdom and one of the top three productions in all of Walt
Disney World. The extravaganza celebrates nature’s diversity with a tal-
ented, colorfully attired cast of singers, dancers, and life-size critters
Part IV: Exploring Walt Disney World 
236

who lead you to an inspiring singalong. Based loosely on the animated
movie, this stage show combines the pageantry of a parade with a tribal
celebration. The action takes place on the center stage and even around
the audience. Even though the pavilion has 1,000 seats, arrive at least 
20 minutes early to ensure you get a spot. The show lasts just under a
half-hour.
Pocahontas and Her Forest Friends
The wait to see Pocahontas and Her Forest Friends can be nightmarish,
and the 15-minute show isn’t remotely close to the caliber of Festival of
the Lion King. In this presentation, Pocahontas and Grandmother Willow,
with the help of some of the forest creatures (a raccoon, turkey, porcu-
pine, rat, and more), bring to light the importance of treating nature with
respect and protecting our forests. Young fans of the movie and of little
creatures will be most appreciative of the performance. If you must go,
go early. The theater has a mere 350 seats, but standing-room crowds
are admitted.
Africa
Enter through the town of Harambe, which means “coming together” in
Swahili. This area of Africa is a re-creation of an African coastal village
poised on the edge of the 21st century. The impressive whitewashed
structures, built of coral stone and thatched with reed brought from
Africa, surround a beautifully landscaped central marketplace that’s rich
with local wares and colors. After passing through the town, the various
trails lead you to Africa’s other rides and attractions.
Kilimanjaro Safaris
This attraction is one of the few rides and the best animal-viewing venue
in the kingdom. But remember: The animals are scarce during the middle
of the day, especially in the heat of summer.
You can wait 45 minutes or more in line at this attraction. Yes, using
FASTPASS (see Chapter 11) is an option, but it virtually eliminates the
chance of riding during the best viewing times. My advice: Skip FAST-
PASS, get to the park a bit before its scheduled opening time, and make
your way straight here. If you simply aren’t a morning person, your next
best shot is to get a FASTPASS that lets you ride as close to the park’s
closing as you can get (so know ahead of time, you’ll have to check back
every so often to get a pass that doesn’t have you returning midday!).
After you reach the end of the very long and winding line, you’ll board a
rather large truck specially made for such an expedition, and set off on a
bouncy ride through the African landscape. Animals in the safari include
black rhinos, hippos, antelopes, Nile crocodiles, zebras, wildebeests, and
lions that, if your timing is right, may offer a half-hearted roar toward
some gazelles that are safely out of reach. The animals roam freely, occa-
sionally crossing the path of the truck allowing a really up-close view, but
Chapter 15: Disney’s Animal Kingdom 237

again, it’s far more likely to occur in the morning or evening hours.
Predictably, the theme is conservation. There’s even a little drama —
this, after all, is a theme-park ride — as you and your mates will help
pursue some park poachers.
“The bumpy ride was fun and way better than having to walk around to
see the animals. Looking over railings isn’t nearly as fun.” I agree with
Nicolas — several giraffe came practically within arm’s length on this
ride. This one’s fun for the whole family, although very small infants
shouldn’t ride because of the bumps.
Pangani Forest Exploration Trail
You can get a good look at hippos, mole rats, and African birds on the
Pangani Forest Exploration Trail, but lowland gorillas are the main fea-
ture. The trail has two gorilla-related areas: One is home to a family com-
prised of a 500-pound silverback, his ladies, and kids; the other has five
bachelors. Most people tend to rush through the trails, missing out on
the chance to see the giant apes, and the animals are not always cooper-
ative, especially in hot weather, when they tend to spend most of the
day in shady areas out of view. But visitors who have good timing or
who make return visits are truly rewarded with up-close views (through
Plexiglas) of these magnificent creatures. 
Rafiki’s Planet Watch
This land, located just above Africa, includes Conservation Station,
which offers a behind-the-scenes look at how Disney cares for animals
inside the park, as you walk past a series of nurseries and veterinary sta-
tions. The problem is that these facilities need staff members present to
make them interesting, and that isn’t always the case. Affection Section
gives you a chance to cuddle some friendly animals (including goats and
potbellied pigs), while Habitat Habit! has a trail that’s home to some
smaller animals, such as cotton-topped tamarins. Note: Take heed of the
signs in the Affection Section that instruct you to put all paper, including
maps, away. Goats love paper and will cause a stampede in an attempt
to snatch your paper products from you.
Asia
Disney’s Imagineers outdid themselves in creating the mythical kingdom
of Anandapur (place of delight) in the Asia section of Animal Kingdom,
with an exotic atmosphere enhanced by the crumbling ruins of an ancient
village, its temples, and even a maharajah’s palace, all decorated with
intricate carvings and artwork.
Expedition Everest — Legend of the Forbidden Mountain
After years of anticipation, Animal Kingdom’s newest thrill ride made its
debut in mid-2006. The journey begins in the mythical Himalayan village
of Serka Zong, one of the best queue’s in all of Disney, where after wind-
ing around you’ll board an old mountain railway bound for Mount Everest
Part IV: Exploring Walt Disney World 
238

which, at 200 feet, is one of Florida’s highest peaks. Passing through
bamboo forests, thundering waterfalls, and glacier fields, the train
ascends higher and higher to the snow-capped peaks of the mountain. As
you might expect, what starts out as a relaxing tour turns into an exciting
expedition as the train hits tracks that are mangled and twisted. The train
races frantically through the icy canyons and caverns as you suddenly
find yourself face to face with the Yeti, guardian and protector of the
mountain (also known as the abominable snowman).
Touted as a family thrill ride, don’t be fooled — it packs quite a punch.
The feeling that you may plummet down the side of the mountain as you
hit the tangled and severed tracks before suddenly thrusting backward
into the darkness. . . . Yikes! This ride is more intense than Big Thunder
Mountain Railroad in the Magic Kingdom (see Chapter 12) but a step or
two down from the twists, turns, loops, and inversions of the Rock ’n’
Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith at Disney–MGM Studios (see
Chapter 14).
A FASTPASS is the only way to avoid this ride’s incredibly lengthy lines.
Although touted as a family ride, children not tall enough to make the 44-
inch height requirement will have to wait this one out. Guests with head,
neck, or back-related ailments should avoid the trek as well.
Flights of Wonder
This live-animal action show is a low-key break from the madness and
offers a few laughs, including Groucho the African yellow-nape, who
entertains the audience with his op-parrot-ic a cappella solos, and the
just-above-your-head soaring of a Harris hawk and a Eurasian eagle owl.
Other feathered stars include an American bald eagle and a crowned
crane.
Kali River Rapids
White-water fanatics may scoff, but for a theme-park raft ride, Kali River
Rapids is pretty good — slightly better than Congo River Rapids at
Busch Gardens (see Chapter 23), but not as good as Popeye & Bluto’s
Bilge-Rat Barges at Islands of Adventure (see Chapter 19); though the
theme is more alluring here. This ride’s churning water mimics realistic
rapids, and its optical illusions make you wonder whether you’re about
to go over the falls. The ride begins with a peaceful tour of lush foliage,
but soon you’re dipping and dripping as your tiny raft tosses and turns
through the jungles. You will get wet (or, more precisely, soaked). The
lines are long, but keep your head up, and enjoy some of the marvelous
art overhead and on the beautiful murals. This ride has a 38-inch height
minimum.
Maharajah Jungle Trek
Disney keeps its promise to provide up-close views of animals with this
exhibit, the setting of which is almost an attraction in its own right. Lush
Chapter 15: Disney’s Animal Kingdom 239

tropical foliage and bamboo grow amidst the ruins, architecture, and
carvings of Nepal, India, Thailand, and Indonesia. It’s some of Disney’s
best thematic work.
If you don’t show up in the midday heat, you’ll probably see Bengal
tigers roaming an abandoned maharajah’s palace through a thick glass
barrier. Nothing but air separates you from dozens of giant fruit bats
hanging in what appears to be a courtyard. Some of the bats have
wingspans of 6 feet. (If you have a phobia, you can bypass this, but know
that the bats are harmless.) Guides are on hand to answer questions,
and you also get a brochure that lists the animals you may spot. You
also have chances to see Komodo dragons, tapirs, playful gibbons, and
acrobatic siamangs, whose calls have been likened to someone in the
throes of pain or passion.
DinoLand U.S.A.
Located to the right, or east side, of Discovery Island as you enter,
DinoLand U.S.A. is Disney’s attempt to capitalize on the dinosaur craze
inspired by Jurassic Park and (ugh) Barney. You enter beneath Olden
Gate Bridge, a 40-foot-tall brachiosaurus reassembled from excavated
fossils. Speaking of which, until late summer 1999, DinoLand had three
paleontologists working on the very real skeleton of Sue, a monstrously
big Tyrannosaurus rex unearthed in the Black Hills of South Dakota in
1990. The paleontologists patched and assembled the bones here,
mainly because Disney helped pay for the project. Alas, Sue has moved
to her permanent home at the Field Museum in Chicago, but a cast
replica of her 67-million-year-old bones, called Dino-Sue, is on display.
The Boneyard
The Boneyard is a great place for parents to catch a second wind. Kids
absolutely love the prehistoric playground, and there are plenty of activ-
ities to wear them down a bit. They can slide and climb over a paleonto-
logical dig site and squeeze through the fossils and skeletons of a
triceratops and a brontosaurus. They can even search the sands for
skeletal remains.
You have to be vigilant about keeping track of your kids here. The
Boneyard is a large area, and although Disney staff monitors them at
both ends, kids play in a multilevel arena where tube slides can take
them from one level to the next in a heartbeat.
DINOSAUR
This ride hurls you through darkness in a CTX Rover time machine, past
an array of snarling audio-animatronic dinosaurs. Some kids may find
the dinosaurs (and darkness) frightening; adults might find them a bit
hokey. However, after Expedition Everest — Legend of the Forbidden
Mountain, DINOSAUR is as close as Animal Kingdom comes to a thrill
Part IV: Exploring Walt Disney World 
240

ride — a twisting-turning, and very jerky, adventure in which you and 20
other passengers try to save the last Iguanadon on Earth from an aster-
oid. Evolution, nature’s fragility, and potential catastrophe are the punch
lines in this lip-biting, armrest-clenching ride against time. It features
some very large lizards (such as a 33-foot carnotaurus, named for its
favorite food — meat).
Plus-size riders may find the seats uncomfortably narrow, especially
with the jerky motions of the ride. Riders must be at least 40 inches tall.
DINOSAUR also has a list of warnings aimed at folks with neck and back
ailments. If you’ve ever wondered what it feels like aboard a bucking
bronco, this rough ride is probably pretty comparable.
“You felt like you were really being thrown around,” 13-year-old Ryan
announced after he got off. Austin (age 11) called it “Awesome!” but
added that it wasn’t as scary as he thought it would be.
Primeval Whirl
Animal Kingdom jumped into the coaster craze with this ride. Primeval
Whirl is a bit tame, and it doesn’t have inversions, but it does have
plenty of spinning action in carnival-style, rider-controlled cars that
whirl by asteroids and hokey dinosaurs that pop up along the track. The
ride has tight loops, short dips, and a final spin that sends you into the
gaping jaws of a fossilized dinosaur.
Though Primeval Whirl was originally supposed to enlarge the park’s
appeal to the kid set, this ride has a 48-inch height minimum.
TriceraTop Spin
The principle behind this kiddie favorite is pretty much the same as the
Magic Carpets of Aladdin and Dumbo The Flying Elephant at WDW’s
Magic Kingdom (see Chapter 12). Cartoonish dinosaurs take riders up,
down, and all around. To the delight of the kids, a dinosaur occasionally
pops its head in and out of the central hub. Most young children, espe-
cially those ages 2 to 6, love it. Parents loathe the long lines.
Finding Nemo — The Musical
Replacing Tarzan Rocks, this musical is scheduled to make a splashy
debut at the end of 2006. In the newly refurbished Theater in the Wild,
Nemo and his dad will take center stage in a spectacular undersea musi-
cal production that combines live dancers and acrobats, animated back-
drops, and puppets. The storyline, which closely follows the animated
movie of the same name, has the ever-curious Nemo becoming sepa-
rated from his overly-protective father, who goes to great lengths to be
reunited with his son.

I
n Chapters 12 through 15, I acquaint you with the major parks of Walt
Disney World. But the House of Mouse is home to much, much more.
In this chapter, I introduce you to the smaller, second-tier attractions, as
well as a few holiday happenings and the Disney Cruise Line.
Playing It Up at DisneyQuest
The minute you step inside you realize this is no ordinary arcade —
throughout the five levels are some of the most cutting-edge games
you’ll find anywhere. Disney has taken the state-of-the-art technology 
of virtual reality, added a spirit of adventure, and shaken it all up with
some of that magical pixie dust for good measure. The result is the
World’s most interactive game complex. From kids just old enough to
work the controls to teens, reactions to DisneyQuest are pretty much
the same: “Awesome!” And although many adults enter the arcade think-
ing that they’re only going to find kids’ stuff, many bite the hook as hard
as their offspring when they get a gander at the electronic wizardry —
everything from old-fashioned pinball with a newfangled twist to virtual-
reality adventure rides.

Here are just some of the entrees that you can find at DisneyQuest:
 Aladdin’s Magic Carpet Ride: Straddling the magic carpet, you’ll
fly through the 3-D Cave of Wonders and the alleys and streets of
Agrabah in search of the magic lamp. This is definitely fun, but your
head may get hot from the virtual-reality helmets.
 Pirates of the Caribbean — Battle for Buccaneer Gold: You and up
to three mates are outfitted in 3-D helmets so you can battle pirate
ships virtual-reality–style. One of you volunteers to be the captain,
steering the ship, while the others assume positions behind can-
nons to blast the black hearts into oblivion — maybe. Each time you
do, you’re rewarded with some doubloons, but beware of sea mon-
sters that can gobble up you and your treasure. In the game’s final
moments, you come face to face with the ghost of Davy Jones. It’s
great fun for all ages, although there’s a 35-inch height requirement.
 Mighty Ducks Pinball Slam: This is an interactive, life-size game in
which the players ride platforms and use body English to try to
score points. It’s your opportunity to explore life as a pinball —
from the ball’s perspective. Just try to stop the quivering in your
arms after this.
 CyberSpace Mountain: If you have an inventive mind (and a steel
stomach), stop in at Cyberspace Mountain, where Bill Nye the
Science-Turned-Roller-Coaster Guy helps you create the ultimate
loop-and-dipster, which you then can ride in a very real-feeling sim-
ulator. It’s a major hit with the coaster-crazy crowd. (I know some
adrenaline junkies who spent hours here constructing, then riding,
one heart-stopper after another.) Bring your own motion-sickness
medicine (though you can choose slow, medium, or quick death).
This thriller has a 51-inch height requirement.
 Animation Academy: If you need some quiet time, sign up at
Animation Academy for a mini course in Disney cartooning. The
academy also has snack and food areas; a typical theme-park–style
meal and drink runs from $12 to $15 per person.
Crowds really start building after lunch when the heat of the day begins
to truly kick in, and they’re simply maddening after dark.
Although some rides and games are appropriate for a variety of ages,
Disney Quest is by far the most appealing to those over 8 or even 10
(some attractions also have height requirements so be sure to check
ahead of time to avoid disappointments). If you have toddlers in tow, be
aware that strollers are not allowed in the building.
See map p. 341. In Downtown Disney West Side (off Buena Vista Drive). % 407-828-
4600. www.disneyquest.com. Admission: $36 adults, $30 kids 3–9 for unlimited
play. Open: Sun–Thurs 11:30 a.m.–11 p.m., Fri–Sat 11:30 a.m. to midnight.

Fielding the Fun at Disney’s Wide 
World of Sports Complex
Disney’s Wide World of Sports is a 200-acre, megacomplex that has a
7,500-seat baseball stadium, 10 other baseball and softball fields, 6 bas-
ketball courts, 12 lighted tennis courts, a track-and-field complex, a golf
driving range, and 6 sand volleyball courts.
If you’re a true sports fan, call for a package of information about the
facilities and a calendar of events (see the listing data below). You can
also consult the facility’s Web site for up-to-date information.
Here’s a sampling of the options at Disney’s Wide World of Sports:
 The Atlanta Braves play 16 spring-training games in the stadium
during a one-month season that begins in early March. Tickets for
the stadium’s two seating areas cost $13 to $22. For tickets call
Ticketmaster (% 407-839-3900). Note: The facility also hosts the
NFL’s Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ spring-training camp.
 The Multi-Sports Experience, which is included in Wide World’s
general admission price, is open on select days. It challenges
guests with activities covering many sports: football, baseball, 
basketball, hockey, soccer, and volleyball.
 The NBA, NCAA, PGA, and Harlem Globetrotters also stage events,
sometimes annually and sometimes more frequently, at the complex.
See map p. 173. On Victory Way, just north of U.S. 192 (west of I-4). % 407-828-3267
or 407-939-4263; 407-939-1500 for sports information. www.disneysports.com.
Admission: $11 adults, $8 kids 3–9 (tax included). Open: Daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m., but hours
may vary by venue.
Gearing Up at the Richard Petty 
Driving Experience
Compared to the Richard Petty Driving Experience at the Walt Disney
World Speedway, Epcot’s thriller Test Track is for sissies. This is your
chance to race like a pro in a 600-horsepower NASCAR race car. How real
is it?
You must sign a two-page waiver with words such as Dangerous,
Calculated Risk, and Update Your Will! before getting into a car. At one
end of the spectrum, you can ride shotgun for a couple of laps at 145
mph ($99). At the other end, you can spend from three hours to two
days learning how to drive the car yourself and racing other daredevils
in 8 to 30 laps of excitement (for a cool $349 to $1,249, not including tax).
You must be 18 or older to ride in the car.
Chapter 16: Enjoying the Rest of Walt Disney World 245

See map p. 173. At Walt Disney World Speedway on World Drive at Vista Boulevard
just off U.S. 192, south of the Magic Kingdom. % 800-237-3889. www.1800be
petty.com. Admission varies by seasons and hours, so call ahead. Open: Daily 
9 a.m.–4 p.m., though hours may vary.
Preparing for the PGA at Disney Golf
The Magic Mickey offers 99 holes of golf: five 18-hole, par-72 courses
and a 9-hole, par-36 walking course. All WDW courses are open to the
public and offer pro shops, equipment rentals, and instruction. For tee
times and information, call % 407-939-4653 up to 60 days in advance.
(Disney resort guests can reserve up to 90 days in advance.) Golf pack-
ages are also available (with select packages available only seven days
in advance), and you can call % 407-934-7639 to make reservations.
Greens fees for Disney hotel guests can range from $69 to $165 per 18-
hole round (it’s $10 more if you’re not a resort guest), though rates are
subject to change at any time and do vary by season and by course. 
Here’s a rundown of the courses:
 Disney’s Eagle Pines (18 holes): Expansive traps and sloping fair-
ways follow the natural lay of the land. Rough pine straw and sand
replace grass on this course, and 16 holes feature water hazards.
 Disney’s Lake Buena Vista (18 holes): This course has a classic
country-club style, with many pines spread across a residential
area. Well-bunkered, it’s also a challenge that demands accuracy.
This course is one of a few that have played host to PGA, LPGA,
and USGA events.
 Disney’s Magnolia (18 holes): The longest course on Disney prop-
erty is designed in classic PGA style. Wide fairways are deceiving;
you have to hunker down and whack the ball, but take care: Eleven
holes have water hazards, and 97 bunkers are on the course. The
6th hole has a special hazard — a Mickey Mouse–shaped sand trap.
 Disney’s Osprey Ridge (18 holes): This Fazio-designed course com-
bines rolling fairways cut through forests of scrub oak, pine, pal-
metto, cypress, and bay trees. The Osprey course is ranked as one
of the best courses in Florida by Golf Digest.
 Disney’s Oak Trail (9 holes): If you can’t go a day without getting in
a few holes, but you don’t have time for the 18-hole courses, this
course is the place to spank the ball. This 9-hole walking course is
designed for families or for a quick golf fix.
 Disney’s Palm (18 holes): By PGA standards, the Palm is Disney’s
toughest course. Set among natural Florida woodlands, the ele-
vated greens, water, and sand traps offer more hazards than
Interstate 4. Good luck with the 18th hole; it’s rated among the
toughest holes on the PGA Tour.

Disney occasionally offers discounted twilight tee times after 3 p.m. and
5 p.m., and often, it’s during the summer season. To find out whether a
discount is available during your visit, call % 407-939-4653 up to seven
days in advance or consult the golf section (hover your mouse over
“More Magic,” then under “Recreation Destinations,” and click “Golf
Courses”) on Walt Disney World’s Web site at www.disneyworld.com.
If you want more golfing options or want to get out of Disney for a bit,
two excellent sources of information and tee-time reservations are
Golfpac (% 888-848-8941 or 407-260-2288; www.golfpacinc.com) 
and Tee Times USA (% 888-465-3356; www.teetimesusa.com).
Puttering Around at Disney Miniature Golf
Those too timid to tee off at Disney’s majors — or whose big games
aren’t yet up to par — can try their putters on the World’s miniature golf
courses. Thanks to four whimsically themed courses, everyone, from
novices to master minigolfers, should find at least one course to their
liking.
Disney’s Winter Summerland Miniature Golf Course
Santa Claus and his elves supply the theme at Winter Summerland, a
well-designed miniature-golf spread that has two 18-hole courses. The
Winter course takes you from an ice castle to a snowman to the North
Pole. The Summer course is pure Florida, from sand castles to surf-
boards to a visit with Santa on the Winternet.
See map p. 173 East off Buena Vista Drive, across from Blizzard Beach. % 407-560-
3000. www.disneyworld.com. Admission: $11 adults, $8.50 kids 3–9. Open: Daily
10 a.m.–11 p.m.
Fantasia Gardens Miniature Golf Course
Fantasia Gardens, located across from Disney–MGM Studios, offers two
18-hole miniature courses drawing inspiration from the Walt Disney clas-
sic cartoon of the same name. On the Fantasia Gardens course, hippos,
ostriches, and gators appear, and the Sorcerer’s Apprentice presides over
the final hole. This is a good course for beginners and kids. Seasoned
minigolfers will probably prefer the tougher Fantasia Fairways, a scaled-
down golf course complete with sand traps, water hazards, tricky putting
greens, and holes ranging from 40 to 75 feet — as for the kids, only those
who can actually golf may find the Fairways any fun.
See map p. 173 On Buena Vista Drive, just east of World Drive. % 407-560-4582.
www.disneyworld.com. Admission: $11 adults, $8.50 kids 3–9. Open: Daily 
10 a.m.–11 p.m.

Making a Splash at Disney’s Water Parks
Disney’s two water parks are great places to chill out for all or part of 
a day. Here are a few things to keep in mind before you head off for a
swim:
 Go in the afternoons — about 2 p.m., even in summer — if you
can stand the heat that long and want to avoid crowds. The early
birds are usually gone by then, and lines are far shorter.
 Another way to enjoy the smallest crowds is to go early in the
week when most weeklong guests are filling the lines at the
theme parks.
 Keep in mind that kids can get lost just as easily at a water park
as they can at a theme park, and the consequences can be worse.
All Disney parks have lifeguards, usually wearing bright red suits,
but to be safe, ask how to identify an on-duty lifeguard, and keep an
eye on your little ones. Life jackets are available, at no charge, for
an added measure of safety but are limited in availability and are in
no way a substitute for adult supervision.
 If modesty is your policy, women should remember to bring a
one-piece bathing suit for the more daring slides. All bathers
should remember the wedgie factor on the more extreme rides,
such as Summit Plummet. You may enter the park wearing baggies,
but, thanks to high-speed water pressure, find yourself in a thong.
Blizzard Beach
The youngest of Disney’s water parks is also tops in the country in atten-
dance. Blizzard Beach is a 66-acre “ski resort” set in the midst of a tropi-
cal lagoon beneath 90-foot, uh-oh, Mount Gushmore. The base of Mount
Gushmore has a sand beach and several other attractions, including a
wave pool and a smaller, kids’ version of the mountain.
Here are brief descriptions of other Blizzard Beach attractions:
 Cross Country Creek is a 2,900-foot tube ride around the park and
through a cave where you get splashed with melting ice.
 Melt-Away Bay is a 1-acre, relatively calm wave pool.
 Runoff Rapids allows you and your tube to careen down your
choice of three twisting-and-turning runs, one of which plunges you
into darkness.
 Ski Patrol Training Camp is designed for preteens. It features a
rope swing, an airborne water drop from a T-bar, slides, such as the
wet and slippery Mogul Mania, and a challenging ice-floe walk along
slippery floating icebergs.
 Slush Gusher is a speed slide that shoots you along a snow-banked
gully. It packs a 48-inch minimum height requirement.
Part IV: Exploring Walt Disney World 
248

 Snow Stormers has three flumes that descend from the top of
Mount Gushmore along a switchback course through ski-type
slalom gates.
 Summit Plummet is wild! Read every speed, motion, vertical-dip,
wedgie, and hold-onto-your-breastplate warning in this guide. Then
test your bravado in a bull ring, a space shuttle, or dozens of other
death-defying hobbies as a warm-up. This one starts out pretty
slow, with a lift ride (even in Florida’s 100°F dog days) to the 120-
foot summit. After you’re at the top, kiss any kids or religious medal
you may carry with you because, if you board, you will be on the
world’s fastest body slide. It’s a test of your courage and your swim-
suit as you’ll be headed virtually straight down and moving, sans
vehicle, at 60 mph by the time you reach the catch pool (the stop
zone). Even the hardiest of riders may find this slide hard to handle;
a veteran thrill-seeker has described the experience as “15 seconds
of paralyzing fear.” Minimum height requirement is 48 inches.
 Teamboat Springs is the World’s longest white-water raft ride. 
Your six-passenger raft twists down a 1,200-foot series of rushing
waterfalls.
 Tike’s Peak is a mini version of Blizzard Beach for mini visitors. It
offers short slides, a squirting ice pool, a fountain play area, and a
snow castle.
 Toboggan Racers is an eight-lane slide that sends you racing, head
first, over exhilarating dips into a “snowy” slope.
See map p. 173 On World Drive, north of the All-Star Resorts and across from Winter
Summerland. % 407-560-3400. www.disneyworld.com. Admission: $36 adults,
$30 kids 3–9. Open: Daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m., with extended hours during peak times, such
as summer.
Typhoon Lagoon
Typhoon Lagoon is the ultimate in water theme parks. Its fantasy setting
is a palm-fringed tropical island village of ramshackle, tin-roofed island
shacks, the entire area strewn with cargo, surfboards, and other marine
wreckage left by the great typhoon. The storm-stranded fishing boat 
(the Miss Tilly) dangles precariously atop the 95-foot Mount Mayday, the
steep setting for several rides. Every 30 minutes, Tilly’s stack blows
shooting a 50-foot geyser even higher into the air.
Here are some other park highlights:
 Castaway Creek is a 2,100-foot lazy river that circles most of the
park. Hop onto a raft or an inner tube and meander through a misty
rain forest and then past caves and secluded grottoes. Water Works,
its theme area, is where jets of water spew from shipwrecked boats
and a Rube Goldberg assemblage of broken bamboo pipes and buck-
ets soak you. Tubes are included in the admission.
Chapter 16: Enjoying the Rest of Walt Disney World 249

 Crush ’n’ Gusher is the newest addition to the park. Coaster cra-
zies will appreciate its gravity-defying drops between which power-
ful jets of water propel riders back uphill, through twists and turns,
only to drop them again. The Banana Blaster, Coconut Crusher, and
Pineapple Plunger offer a unique, out-of-control experience, each
sending riders careening on a different route through the remains
of a ramshackle fruit-exporting plant. Roughly the same length
(410–420 ft. long) the three spillways feature varying degrees of
slopes and turns to keep you coming back for more.
 Humunga Kowabunga consists of three 214-foot Mount Mayday
slides that propel you down the mountain on a serpentine route
through waterfalls and bat caves and past nautical wreckage at up
to 30 mph before depositing you into a bubbling catch pool; each
slide offers slightly different views and thrills. Seating also is avail-
able for non-Kowabunga folks whose kids have commissioned them
to “watch me.” Women should wear a one-piece on the slides (unless
you don’t mind putting on a different sort of show for gawkers). This
attraction has a 48-inch height minimum.
 Ketchakiddee Creek is a kiddie area designed exclusively for the
kiddie set (2–5 years). An innovative water playground, it has bub-
bling fountains in which kids can frolic; mini waterslides; a pint-
size, white-water tubing run; spouting whales and squirting seals;
rubbery crocodiles on which to climb; grottoes to explore; and
waterfalls under which to loll.
 Typhoon Lagoon is the park’s main swimming area. This large (2.75
million gallons) and lovely lagoon (one of the world’s largest inland
wave pools) is the size of two football fields and is surrounded by a
white sandy beach. The chlorinated water has a turquoise hue
much like the waters of the Caribbean. Large waves hit the shore
every 90 seconds. A foghorn sounds to warn you when a wave is
coming. Young children can wade in the lagoon’s more peaceful
tidal pools — Blustery Bay and Whitecap Cove.
You can catch a wave at popular early-bird surfing sessions that
take place at the lagoon on select mornings before the park offi-
cially opens. For those not brave enough to learn in the ocean, this
controlled environment may be a good alternative. For more infor-
mation on the surfing program, see Chapter 27.
 White-Water Rides, found in Mount Mayday, is the setting for three
white-water rafting adventures — Keelhaul Falls, Mayday Falls,
and Gang Plank Falls — all of which offer steep drops coursing
through caves and passing lush scenery. Keelhaul Falls has the
most spiraling route, Mayday Falls has the steepest drops and
fastest water, and the slightly tamer Gang Plank Falls uses large
tubes so that the whole family can pile on.

See map on p. 173. Located off Buena Vista Drive between the Downtown Disney
Marketplace and Disney–MGM Studios. % 407-560-4141. www.disneyworld.
com. Admission: $36 adults, $30 kids 3–9. Open: Daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m., with extended
hours during some holiday periods and summer.
Enjoying the Holiday Season at Disney
Disney uses extra pixie dust during the holidays as the parks and resorts
are decked out more spectacularly than you can even imagine. They
bring out the holiday spirit in a way only Disney can. Lights, trees, carol-
ing, and special activities begin around Thanksgiving and last until the
first of the new year. For more information on all the events in this sec-
tion, call % 407-934-7639 or check out www.disneyworld.com.
Four of the best yuletide attractions include the following:
 Mickey’s Very Merry Christmas Party, an after-dark ticketed event
(7 p.m. to midnight), takes place on select nights at the Magic
Kingdom and offers a traditional Christmas parade and a breath-
taking fireworks display. The charge ($46 adults, $38 kids 3–9; if you
buy in advance, you’ll save $6 per ticket) includes cookies, cocoa,
and a souvenir photo. The best part? Shorter lines for the rides
that are open.
 Holidays Around the World at Epcot features a Candlelight
Processional with hundreds of candle-holding carolers, a celebrity
narrator telling a Christmas story, a 450-voice choir, and a 50-piece
orchestra. Also held on select nights, this moving event features
several celebrities during its five-week run. Normal theme park
admission ($63 adults, $52 kids 3–9) is charged.
 The Osborne Family Spectacle of Lights came to Disney–MGM
Studios in 1995, when an Arkansas family ran into trouble with
hometown authorities over their multimillion-light display. It seems
they’d committed the ultimate Little Rock sin, taking to heart the
old hymn that says, “You can’t be a beacon if your light don’t
shine.” Their Christmas-light collection of 2-million-plus blinkers,
twinklers, and strands was so bright that their neighbors com-
plained. (Imagine it next to your bedroom window!) After the flow
of faithful spectators in cars caused mile-long backups, the neigh-
bors, finally seeing the light, went to court. Disney came to the
rescue and, in 1995, moved the whole thing to Orlando, adding a
million or so bulbs to the display. You can see it all for the normal
park admission ($63 adults, $52 kids 3–9).
 For those 21 and over, Downtown Disney’s Pleasure Island New
Year’s Eve is a celebration featuring big-name performers (in the
past acts have included Cheap Trick, Tone Loc, Kurtis Blow, and Kim
Waters among others). Tickets include entrance to all the Pleasure
Island clubs and a spectacular midnight fireworks display — not to
mention all the loud music your ears can handle.
Chapter 16: Enjoying the Rest of Walt Disney World 251

The other Orlando parks and many of the WDW resorts hold their own
holiday festivities featuring special activities, spectacular decorations,
holiday-themed parades, and more. Be sure to ask in advance or check
with your concierge or at Guest Services when you arrive.
Sailing the Seas with Disney
It took them a while to catch on, which is unusual for the Disney folks,
but they finally discovered another place to expand their empire — the
high seas. Disney Cruise Line launched the Disney Magic and the Disney
Wonder in 1998 and 1999, respectively.
The two ships have small differences. The Magic is Art Deco, with a giant
Mickey in its three-level lobby and a Beauty and the Beast mural in its top
restaurant, Lumiere’s. The Wonder is Art Nouveau; Ariel commands its
lobby, and its featured eatery, Triton’s, sports a mural from The Little
Mermaid. Both ships have recently been refurbished.
The restaurants, nightlife, shows, and other onboard activities on both
vessels are very family-oriented (indeed, the Disney ships are the best in
all cruisedom for kids). One of the ships’ unique features is a dine-around
option that lets you move among main restaurants (each ship has four)
from night to night while keeping the same servers. Disney also offers
Castaway Cay, its own private Bahamian island, featuring watersports
and other activities.
The Disney Magic sails seven-day eastern Caribbean (St. Thomas, St.
Maarten, and Castaway Cay) and seven-day western Caribbean (Key
West, Grand Cayman, Cozumel, and Castaway Cay) itineraries on an
alternating basis year-round. The Disney Wonder offers shorter three-
and four-day Bahamas cruises that are often (though not necessarily)
sold as part of seven-day vacation packages, combining the sailings with
a Walt Disney World land experience. Subtle differences aside, these
two ships are nearly identical twins. Both are 83,000 tons with 12 decks,
875 extra-large cabins, and room for up to 1,755 guests (when each
ship’s children’s berths are filled to capacity, that total can reach as high
as 3,325). The ships have some adults-only areas, but no casinos.
During the summer of 2007 the Disney Magic will sail the high seas start-
ing from a different port of call: Barcelona, Spain. This is the first time
Disney has included a European itinerary in its lineup. Sailing from
Barcelona, the ship will stop in such cities as Florence, Rome, Pisa, 
and Cannes. Four 11-night cruises are scheduled, departing on select
Saturdays in May, June, and July, while four 10-night cruises are sched-
uled to depart on select Wednesdays in June, July, and August. Two spe-
cial 14-night transatlantic cruises are scheduled as well (the ship has to
get to Barcelona and back again somehow). Prices range from $2,399 to
$3,499 based on double occupancy. For more information, sail over to
www.disneycruise.com or call % 888-325-2500.
Part IV: Exploring Walt Disney World 
252

Recently updated, the line’s free kids’ programs are some of the best at
sea. Just as at Disney World, costumed Disney characters are available at
scheduled times during the voyage, so that passengers can line up for
hugs and photos. The children’s program is divided into five age groups:
the Flounder’s Reef Nursery for ages 3 months to 3 years, Disney’s
Oceaneer Club for ages 3 to 7, Disney’s Oceaneer Lab for ages 8 to 12,
Ocean Quest for ages 10 to 14, and The Stack or Aloft for ages 13 to 17.
Each program offers numerous age-appropriate activities and diversions.
Especially important to parents with young kids, Disney has expanded
its Flounder’s Reef Nursery on both ships to hold as many as 30 children
with a child/counselor ratio of four to one. Extended hours are featured
on seven-night cruises so parents can dine alone, try a spa treatment, or
sneak off for a shore excursion. Best of all, unlike other cruise lines, the
nursery welcomes infants from as young as 12 weeks old to 3-year-old
toddlers. The space has cribs, and counselors do change diapers
(though you must supply them). The price is $6 per child for the first
child, $5 per each additional child, per hour with a two-hour minimum.
You can get discounted fares if you book well in advance and go during
non-peak periods. The line also offers special fares for kids 3 to 12 travel-
ing as a third, fourth, or fifth passenger sharing a cabin with two adults.
All cruises depart from Port Canaveral, which is about an hour east of
Orlando by car. If you buy a Land & Sea package, transportation to and
from Orlando is included. For more information, call Disney Cruise Line
or check out its very informative Web site, which also allows you to plan
and reserve shore excursions before you go.
Hwy 528 at A1A, Cape Canaveral. % 800-951-3532. www.disneycruise.com.
Seven-day Land & Sea packages (3 or 4 days afloat, with the rest of the week at a
WDW resort): $939–$5,399 adults, $399–$2,199 kids 3–12, and $169 kids younger than
3, depending on your choice of resort and stateroom. Some packages include round-
trip air, and unlimited admission to Disney parks, Pleasure Island, and other attrac-
tions. Three-night cruises: $429–$2,999 adults, $229–$1,099 kids 3–12, and $149 kids
younger than 3. Four-night cruises: $499–$3,999 adults, $329–$1,199 kids 3–12, and
$149 kids younger than 3.

Shopping in Walt 
Disney World
In This Chapter
 Getting money-saving tips
 Shopping inside the parks
 Cruising the shopping districts outside of Disney
 Taking advantage of airport options
P
art of the fun of going on vacation is stocking up on souvenirs. A
trip to Walt Disney World shouldn’t be any different — unless you
want to arrive home with money in your wallet. In this chapter, you dis-
cover the ins and outs of shopping for Walt Disney World mementos.
Money-Saving Tips for Top-Notch Take-Homes
The kids are tugging at your shirt, begging you for 14-carat Mouse ears
and the biggest stuffed Mickey on the planet, your mother just has to have
a pair of Goofy slippers, and you’ve always wanted a crystal Cinderella
clock for the den. Then you see the price tags. Gasp! Are they kidding? No,
unfortunately, they are not.
You’re an emotional and physical captive of a commercial enterprise
sprinkled with feel-good pixie dust when you’re at Disney. Now I’m just
guessing and don’t know this for sure, but I think Disney uses a simple for-
mula for setting prices: Start with reasonable retail and then multiply . . .
by three. Don’t panic just yet, not everything is so completely out of reach,
and if you keep reading I’ll point you in the right direction.
But no matter how much I warn you, you probably won’t escape without
a sizable contribution to the stockholders’ fund, especially if it’s your
first trip to Walt Disney World or you have kids in tow. So before you
start spending, here are a few things to think about:

 If there’s a Disney Store near your hometown, some of what’s sold in
the Disney parks likely is sold there as well. You can also get a fairly
large selection of it on the Internet at www.disneystore.com. So
there’s no need to rush into a purchase. (Notable exceptions how-
ever are goods sold in the World Showcase pavilions at Epcot and
Walt Disney World logo merchandise sold throughout the parks.)
 At the other end of the spectrum, many WDW shops sell products
themed to their particular area of the park (such as the shops
found at the exit of many rides or the kiosks found throughout the
different lands), and finding the identical item elsewhere in the
parks (let alone outside the parks) may be difficult at best. 
 Don’t be fooled by the discount stores offering you a “bargain.” You
usually won’t find bargains or discounts on true or authentic WDW
merchandise anywhere. If someone offers you one (especially out-
side the parks), beware. The bargain or discount may be a cheap
imitation or knockoff — or worse, “hot.”
 Don’t forget to account for the 6.5 percent sales tax on purchases.
Loading Up Your Cart at Walt Disney World
In general, you’ll find three categories of merchandise in the WDW parks.
Souvenirs that scream “Disney!” are the most common. (The number of
choices — from Ariel to Winnie the Pooh and beyond — can, and will,
fog your brain.) Collectibles, including some not related to Disney, are
another. You find these items in some of the Main Street shops in the
Magic Kingdom, as well as around the World Showcase in Epcot and at
the Downtown Disney Marketplace. The last category, merchandise
native to the 11 countries showcased throughout Epcot’s World
Showcase, and completely unrelated to Disney whatsoever, is aptly con-
sidered a World Showcase specialty.
Why lug all your bulky purchases around? You can send your purchases
from any store to designated areas near the entrance, where you can
pick them up as you leave the park that day. In the Magic Kingdom, you
can pick up packages at Guest Relations next to City Hall in the Plaza
area. In Epcot, you can send your packages to the Gift Stop in the
Entrance Plaza or the World Traveler at the International Gateway in
World Showcase. Disney–MGM Studios shop clerks will send your good-
ies to the package pickup next to Oscar’s Super Service in front of the
park. And you can pick up your Animal Kingdom purchases at Garden
Gate Gifts near the Entrance Plaza. (Allow at least three hours for deliv-
ery.) If you’re a Disney resort guest, you can have your packages deliv-
ered to your resort for free — ask the shops about this service. Packages
may not arrive until the next afternoon if purchased prior to 7 p.m.; if
purchased after 7 p.m. they’ll arrive the second afternoon after your pur-
chase was made.
Chapter 17: Shopping in Walt Disney World 255

Magic Kingdom
The Emporium along Main Street U.S.A. has a large selection of
Disneyana including pricey collectibles such as Minnie Mouse cookie
jars and vintage Mickey Mouse wristwatches, as well as apparel, toys,
and trinkets. The Fantasy Faire inside Cinderella Castle sells family
crests, tapestries, suits of armor, and other medieval wares, as well as
miniature carousels.
Pirates Bazaar in Adventureland peddles hats, Captain Hook T-shirts,
ships in bottles, toy muskets, and loads of other yo-ho-ho buccaneer
booty, in addition to jewelry and a small selection of resort wear. It’s 
outside the Pirates of the Caribbean ride.
The Frontier Trading Post in Frontierland hawks cowboy hats, Western
shirts, coonskin caps, turquoise jewelry, belts, and toy rifles.
The Yankee Trader in Liberty Square is a charming country store that
sells Lion King and Pooh cookie jars, Disney cookie cutters, and fancy
food items. 
Wares at Tinker Bell’s Treasures include Peter Pan merchandise, cos-
tumes (Tinker Bell, Snow White, Cinderella, Pocahontas, and others),
and collector dolls. And just at the exit of Mickey’s PhilharMagic, you’ll
find a collection of trinkets, toys, and T’s that feature Donald Duck.
Pooh’s Thotful Shop in Fantasyland is dedicated to Hundred-Acre Gang
merchandise, including plenty of Pooh and Tigger items.
Inside the Toontown Hall of Fame you’ll find a large array of toys, T’s,
candy, and other Disney-themed trinkets.
Mickey’s Star Traders and Merchants of Venus in Tomorrowland are
other places to get a look at Disney collectibles along with just about
anything else Disney, and the spaceship shaped kiosk just outside Buzz
Lightyear’s Space Ranger Spin has enough Toy Story toys to fill any kid’s
toy chest.
Epcot
Future World has only a few shops to call its own, and most are ride
related. The most notable in the bunch is Mouse Gear, filled top to
bottom with everything Disney (most of which is adorned with characters
or the Disney logo) from T-shirts to trinkets and everything in between.
The Art of Disney has a small though impressive selection of original art-
work, lithographs, cels, and various posters available for purchase.
World Showcase pavilions carry unique and unusual items that repre-
sent their respective pavilion’s country. Following are some of the shop-
ping highlights.
Part IV: Exploring Walt Disney World 
256

Heritage Manor Gifts in the American Adventure in the U.S.A. Pavilion
sells autographed presidential photographs, needlepoint samplers,
quilts, pottery, candles, Davy Crockett hats, books on U.S. history, his-
torically costumed dolls, classic political campaign buttons, and vintage
newspapers with banner headlines such as “Nixon Resigns!” You can
also buy Disney art and character merchandise, as well as popular
Disney pins.
The Canada Pavilion’s Northwest Mercantile carries sandstone and
soapstone carvings, fringed leather vests, duck decoys, moccasins, an
array of stuffed animals, Native American dolls and spirit stones, rabbit-
skin caps, knitted sweaters, and, of course, maple syrup.
The China Pavilion’s Yong Feng Shangdian Department Store is a
bustling marketplace filled with an array of merchandise including silk
robes, brocade pajamas, lacquer and inlaid mother-of-pearl furniture,
jade figures, cloisonné vases, tea sets, silk rugs and embroideries, 
dolls, fans, wind chimes, and clothing. Artisans demonstrate calligraphy
here, too.
Emporia is the covered shopping area filled with several little boutiques
found in the France Pavilion. Merchandise includes art, cookbooks,
cookware, wines (there’s a tasting counter), Madeline and Babar books
and dolls, perfumes, and original letters written by famous Frenchmen,
such as Napoleon. This is one of only two locations in the entire world
to feature signature Guerlain fragrances.
The Germany Pavilion’s shops feature Hümmel figurines (one of only
eight worldwide locations to carry a complete collection), crystal, glass-
ware, cookware, cuckoo clocks, cowbells, Alpine hats, German wines
(there’s a tasting counter) and foods, books, and toys (German Disneyana,
teddy bears, dolls, and puppets). An artisan sometimes demonstrates
molding and painting Hümmel figures; another paints detailed scenes 
on eggs.
La Cucina Italiana and Il Bel Cristallo in the Italy Pavilion stock cameo
and delicate filigree jewelry, fine leather goods, Armani figurines, cook-
ware, Italian wines and foods, Murano and other Venetian glass, alabaster
figurines, inlaid wooden music boxes, and festive Carnivale masks.
In the Japan Pavilion, the Mitsukoshi Department Store (Japan’s answer
to Sears) stocks lacquerware, kimonos, kites, fans, dolls in traditional cos-
tumes, origami books, samurai swords, Japanese Disneyana, bonsai trees,
Japanese foods, Netsuke carvings, pottery, and electronics. Artisans in the
courtyard demonstrate the ancient arts of anesaiku (shaping brown rice
candy into dragons, unicorns, and dolphins), sumi-e (calligraphy), and
origami (paper folding). Kids interested in the Hello Kitty gang or anime
cartoons will find plenty to ask you to buy.
Chapter 17: Shopping in Walt Disney World 257

Given Tokyo’s notorious astronomical prices, this store may be one of
the few places in WDW where you can actually score a relative bargain.
In the Mexico Pavilion, shops in and around the Plaza de Los Amigos
(a Mexican mercado market with a tiered fountain and street lamps) dis-
play an array of leather goods, baskets, sombreros, piñatas, pottery,
embroidered dresses and blouses, maracas, jewelry, serapes, paper
flowers, colorful papier-mâché birds, and blown-glass objects (an artisan
gives glass-blowing demonstrations).
The Morocco Pavilion’s streets lead to the souk, a bustling marketplace
where handcrafted pottery, brassware, hand-knotted Berber carpets,
colorful Rabat carpets, ornate silver and camel-bone boxes, straw bas-
kets, and prayer rugs are sold. You can also catch weaving demonstra-
tions during the day.
The Norway Pavilion’s shops sell hand-knitted wool hats and sweaters
(including a collection by Dale of Norway), toys (there’s a LEGO table
where kids can play), trolls, woodcarvings, Scandinavian foods, pewter-
ware, jewelry, and Christmas items. There’s also a nice selection of fra-
grances, body creams, and candles.
High Street and Tudor Lane shops in the United Kingdom Pavilion dis-
play a broad sampling of British merchandise, including toy soldiers,
Paddington bears, Thomas the Tank Engine wooden train sets, personal-
ized coats of arms, Scottish clothing (cashmere and Shetland sweaters,
tams, knits, and tartans), Wimbledon sportswear, fine English china,
Waterford crystal, and pub items such as tankards and dartboards. A tea
shop occupies a replica of Anne Hathaway’s thatch-roofed, 16th-century
cottage in Stratford-upon-Avon. Other stores represent the Georgian,
Victorian, Queen Anne, and Tudor periods.
Disney–MGM Studios
The Animation Gallery carries collectible animation cels, books about
animation, arts-and-crafts kits for future animators, and collector fig-
urines. Sid Cahuenga’s One-of-a-Kind sells autographed photos of the
stars, original movie posters, and star-touched jewelry and other memo-
rabilia. Over at the Darkroom/Cover Story, you can have your photo-
graph put on the cover of your favorite magazine. Celebrity 5 & 10,
modeled after a 1940s Woolworth’s, is filled with unique Disney-esque
housewares, MGM Studios T-shirts, and movie posters.
Many of the park’s major attractions also have shops or kiosks filled
with items such as Indiana Jones adventure clothing, Little Mermaid
stuffed characters, Star Wars light sabers, LEGO sets, and so on.
Animal Kingdom
The Oasis’s Outpost Shop deals in T-shirts, sweatshirts, hats, toys, and
other souvenir items.
Part IV: Exploring Walt Disney World 
258

Beastly Bazaar in Safari Village has a wide selection of items related to
the Tree of Life and the show It’s Tough to Be a Bug!, along with choco-
lates, candies, and home décor items. Creature Comforts sells clothing,
stuffed animals, and toys, and is mostly geared for kids. Island Mercantile
offers theme merchandise that represents the park’s lands with a plenti-
tude of character merchandise. It also has a hair-braiding service and a
pin-trading location.
Mombasa Marketplace/Ziwani Traders in Africa sells Kilimanjaro
Safaris apparel and gifts, as well as realistic animal items, including
beautiful wood carvings, and other authentic African gifts.
Chester & Hester’s Dinosaur Treasures in DinoLand U.S.A. has wild
and wacky dinosaur souvenirs, tons of toys and trinkets (many under
$5), and T-shirts.
Disney Shopping Outside the Theme Parks
Don’t think that the enticement to spend money magically disappears
when you step outside the theme parks. Walt Disney World also encom-
passes some shopping districts that house a multitude of shops — some
of which carry merchandise you can’t get anywhere else — that offer
you the chance to blow your budget.
Chapter 17: Shopping in Walt Disney World 259
Great things to buy at Epcot
Epcot’s World Showcase shines in the shopping department. Although the selections
here change from time to time and may not necessarily represent bargains, they are
the kind of unique and unusual items you may not find anywhere else.
 If you’re into silver jewelry, don’t miss the Mexico Pavilion. You can find trinkets
ranging from simple flowered hair clips to stone-and-silver bracelets.
 The shops in the Norway Pavilion have great sweaters and Scandinavian trolls
that are so ugly you’re likely to fall in love with them.
 In the China Pavilion, browse through jade teardrop earrings, Disney art, and
more. Its merchandise is among the most expensive and most fetching in Epcot.
 The Italy Pavilion’s 100-percent silk scarves and ties come in several patterns.
 Style-conscious teenagers may love a Taquia knit cap, something of a colorful
fezlike chapeau, that’s available in the Morocco Pavilion. You can also find beau-
tifully painted pottery.
 Wimbledon shirts, shorts, and skirts are among the hard-to-find items in the
United Kingdom Pavilion, which also has an assortment of tea accessories,
sweaters, and Beatles memorabilia.

Disney’s West Side
Disney’s West Side has many rather unique specialty stores where you
can find plenty of unusual gifts and souvenirs.
Hoypoloi is a New Age store offering artsy glass, sculptures, and other
decorative doodads made from metal, stone, and wood. Magnetron
Magnetz is, well, wow! Can there be a market for this many refrigerator
magnets? Magic Masters, a re-creation of Harry Houdini’s private library,
is the place for magic tricks and illusions, and the magic experts here
often entertain guests with a few tricks of their own. Smoking may be on
the way to sayonara-ville, but Sosa Family Cigars beckons with sweet
smells and a tradition reaching back to yesterday’s Cuba. Over at
Starabilias, the main events are jukeboxes, Coke machines, and other
nostalgic treasures and collectibles. Pop Gallery, named for the colorful
and original artwork that seemingly “pops” out at passersby, features
limited-edition paintings, sculptures, and gifts.
Disney’s West Side (% 407-828-3800; www.disneyworld.com) is on
Buena Vista Drive. From I-4, exit on Highway 536 or Highway 535 and
follow the signs. Some shop times vary, but the complex is open daily
from 9:30 a.m. to 11 p.m.
Downtown Disney Marketplace
Basin offers a cornucopia of fresh-made bath products, including glyc-
erin soaps and wonderful bath bombs. The Art of Disney is a one-of-a-
kind gallery filled with animation cels, original artwork, limited editions,
lithographs, and fine art. Arribas Brothers comes calling with products
that crystal and metal artists make before your eyes. Summer Sands
features hip designer duds and swimwear, but for those who prefer a
sportier look, try Team Mickey Athletic Club, with its sports-minded
character clothing and NASCAR and ESPN merchandise. Once Upon A
Toy shelves popular games, including Disney-themed versions of Mr.
Potato Head, Clue, Monopoly, and much more.
The LEGO Imagination Center is one of the best shops around. This spot
is fabulous for moms and dads to relax while their young whippersnap-
pers unwind in a free LEGO building play area beside the store. World of
Disney comes with the (don’t-hold-it-to-them) promise that if it exists, and
it’s Disney, it’s on their shelves. Within the walls of World of Disney you’ll
also find two very new and very unique rooms: the Adventure Room,
where pint-size pirates can set sail for the high seas and try their hand at
Disney’s latest video games; and the Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique, a salon of
sorts, where little princesses can get the royal treatment thanks to a bit of
makeover magic.
Downtown Disney Marketplace (% 407-828-3800; www.disneyworld.
com) is on Buena Vista Drive at Hotel Plaza Boulevard. From I-4, exit on
Highway 536 or Highway 535 and follow the signs. It’s open daily from
9:30 a.m. to 11 p.m.

Part V
Exploring the Rest 
of Orlando

In this part . . . 
M
ickey may be the toughest mouse around, but he
doesn’t own Orlando anymore. Yes, this is still the
town that Disney built, but the fact is, half of the eight big-
league attractions in Orlando don’t belong to Disney.
This part of the book explores the rest of Orlando, including
the exciting attractions at Universal Orlando as well as what
you ﬁnd at SeaWorld, Discovery Cove, the smaller attractions,
and some of the best shopping venues outside the parks. It
also includes information on great day trips to two of the
most popular attractions outside of the immediate Orlando
area: Busch Gardens and the Kennedy Space Center.

 Shopping for souvenirs
W
ith two studios in Orlando, you soon get the picture, literally and
figuratively, about which studio produces what films in the movie
business. Both Universal and Disney–MGM Studios (see Chapter 14) 
have plenty to offer, and they both spend plenty of money plugging 
their movies and characters. At Universal, that investment means you’ll
encounter the Mummy, Twister, Terminator, Jaws, E.T., Shrek, Barney, and
many more. You’ll also find plenty of grown-up, cutting edge, hurl-’em-and-
twirl-’em rides, such as Back to the Future The Ride, Men in Black Alien
Attack, and Earthquake — The Big One. Universal has recently made
great strides to appeal to younger kids as well, especially with Woody
Woodpecker’s KidZone and its pint-size rides, shows, and play areas.
As a plus, Universal is a working television and movie studio, so occa-
sionally some live filming is done at the various sound stages in the
park. You can also see reel history displayed in the form of actual sets
exhibited along Hollywood Boulevard and Rodeo Drive. A talented
troupe of actors portraying Universal stars, such as the Blues Brothers,
or a wide range of not-so-recognizable characters, often wander the park
chatting with guests along the way. And park shows, such as Terminator
2: 3D Battle Across Time and Fear Factor Live deliver heart-pumping
excitement.
In this chapter, I give you helpful hints and basic information about visit-
ing Universal Studios Florida and experiencing its attractions.
Finding Out Important Park Information
Before I get on to the good stuff of USF, I first need to get the logistical

Buying tickets and making reservations
You can choose from several ticket options and tours:
 A one-day ticket costs $67 (plus 6.5 percent sales tax) for adults,
$56 for children 3 to 9.
 A two-day, two-park ticket is $110 for adults and children. These
passes enable you to move between Universal Studios Florida and
Islands of Adventure (see Chapter 19) throughout the day so you
can go back and forth whenever you like. Note: For a limited time, 
if you make your purchase online (www.universalorlando.com),
Universal is offering three promotional options: Get three more
days for free, for a total of five consecutive days of admission; get
three more days for free and in addition for each adult ticket you
purchase you’ll get a free child’s ticket; or opt for your two-day
ticket not to expire (meaning you can use the second day any time
in the future). Two-day tickets also give you free access at night to
select CityWalk clubs (see Chapter 25).
 Annual Passes (the Preferred Annual Pass and the Power Pass)
allow entry to the park for an entire year (some blackout dates
apply to the Power Pass; there are no blackout dates with the
Preferred Annual Pass). The costs are $180 and $120, respectively.
For more details check out www.universalorlando.com.
 The FlexTicket multiday, multipark option is the most economical
way to see the various “other-than-Disney” parks. You pay one
price to visit any and all of the participating parks during a 14-day
period. A four-park pass to Universal Studios Florida, Islands of
Adventure, Wet ’n Wild, and SeaWorld is $190 for adults and $156
for children 3 to 9. A five-park pass, which adds Busch Gardens 
in Tampa, is $235 for adults and $200 for kids. You can order the
FlexTicket by calling % 407-363-8000 or online by going to www.
universalorlando.com.
 Universal Studios Florida offers five-hour, guided VIP Tours for
$100 to $120 per person for just USF, $125 to $150 per person for a
two-park, seven-hour tour that also includes Islands of Adventure.
Guided tours include line-cutting privileges and preferred seating at
several attractions, and they start at 10 a.m. and noon daily. For
more information on the VIP tour, call % 407-363-8295. Note: The
price of the VIP Tour includes neither the 6.5 percent sales tax nor
admission to the park!
Theme-park prices are not the only things that will lighten your wallet.
Expect to spend up to $3 for a soda, $2 (and up) for a cup of coffee,
about $5 (and up) for a beer, $2.60 for popcorn, and $2.50 for bottled
water. However, you can save 10 percent on your purchases at any gift
shop or on a meal by showing your American Automobile Association
(AAA) card. This discount isn’t available at food or merchandise carts.
Part V: Exploring the Rest of Orlando 
266

Likewise, tobacco, candy, film, collectibles, and sundry items aren’t
included in discounts.
For information about new travel packages and theme-park information,
call % 877-801-9720, 800-711-0080, 800-224-4233, or 407-363-8000; write
to Guest Services at Universal Studios Florida, 1000 Universal Studios
Plaza, Orlando, FL 32819-7601; or visit its Web site at www.universal
orlando.com. After you’re at the park, just head over to Guest Services.
Universal Orlando is located about half a mile north of I-4’s Kirkman
Road/Highway 435 exit. You may find construction in the area, so keep
an eye out for the road signs directing you to Universal Orlando.
The park is open 365 days a year. Park hours generally are from 9 a.m. to
6 or 7 p.m., though they vary seasonally and the park may close as late
as 10 p.m. during the summer and on holidays. Call or check online for
exact times before you go.
Locating special services and facilities
In case you forgot to bring essential items, or if you need special assis-
tance while at the park, here’s a list of services and facilities that may
come in handy:
 ATMs accepting cards from banks using the Cirrus, STAR, and PLUS
systems are on the outside near Guest Services and just inside
Universal’s entrance as well as in San Francisco/Amity near
Lombard’s Seafood Grille.
 You can find baby-changing tables in all men’s and women’s rest-
rooms; nursing facilities are at Family Services, just inside the
main entrance and to the right. (Family Services doesn’t sell dia-
pers or infant supplies of any kind, so be sure that you bring
enough of your own.)
 Disposable cameras and film (and limited digital supplies) are
available at the On Location shop in the Front Lot, just inside the
main entrance. One-hour photo developing is available, but I don’t
recommend paying park prices. You can find many cheaper one-
hour or overnight places around town, including many near tourist-
area hotels.
 Universal has its own version of Disney’s FASTPASS, called Universal
Express Plus Pass. Unfortunately, at Universal, the Plus means
having to pay for your park tickets plus the Express Pass. The passes
are available for purchase online or at the park, but be aware that
they (like the freebies at Disney) run out, often by midday, some-
times earlier, during peak seasons. The pass allows access to the
Express line at each and every attraction that accepts the Universal
Express Pass without having to continually obtain separate passes
or wait for any time limits to expire before heading to the Universal
Express line at the next attraction. The downside is that it can only

be used once at each of the attractions. The price varies and can run
between $15 and $50 per ticket depending on whether it’s good for
one or both Universal parks and what date the pass is valid for. Visit
www.universalorlando.com for all the details.
 Universal offers a separate line-beating option as a perk for those
visitors staying at its resorts. All guests of the Portofino Bay Hotel,
Hard Rock Hotel, and Royal Pacific Resort (see Chapter 9) have to
do is to show their room keys to get unlimited Express-line access
to the rides and front-of-the-line access to most of the restaurants.
 You can find First Aid Stations between New York and San Francisco,
next to Louie’s Italian Restaurant, and just inside the main entrance
next to Guest Services.
 Rent lockers for $8 and $10 a day. Be sure to read the instructions
carefully when using the newer electronic lockers — otherwise
you’ll spend valuable time tracking down a park attendant to help
retrieve your gear instead of riding the rides.
 Report lost children to any staff member and then go to Guest
Services near the main entrance or Security (behind Louie’s Italian
Restaurant, between New York and San Francisco). Make sure chil-
dren younger than 7 wear name tags inside their clothing for easy
identification in case they get lost.
 When parking in multilevel garages, write down your location,
including the character, level, row, and space number so you can
find your car later. Parking costs $10 for cars and trucks. Valet park-
ing is available for $16. After 6 p.m., parking is free. Universal’s
garages are connected to its parks by walkways and a series of
moving sidewalks, but reaching the gates can take a while.
 The park provides car assistance, including battery jumps. If you
need assistance with your car, raise the hood and tell any parking
attendant your location. Use the call boxes located throughout the
parking garage to call for security.
 Pet care for your small animals is available at the Studio Kennel in
the parking garages for $10 a day (no overnight stays), but you’ll
have to feed and walk your animals yourself. Ask the parking atten-
dant where you pay for parking to direct you to the kennel.
 Rent strollers on Amity Avenue in San Francisco and at Guest
Services, just inside the entrance to the right. The cost is $10 for 
a single and $16 for a double.
 You can rent regular wheelchairs for $12 per day on Amity Avenue
in San Francisco and at Guest Services just inside the main gate.
Electric wheelchairs are $40 per day. Both require a $50 deposit
and a signed contract.
 Package delivery is available for purchases made at park stores
(though not at the kiosks and carts). You can have your purchases
Part V: Exploring the Rest of Orlando 
268

sent to It’s A Wrap near the entrance to be picked up on your way
out. If you’re a guest at one of the three Universal hotels you can
have your purchase delivered to your room (though delivery will
be the following day, so don’t try this if it’s your last day).
If you find you have arrived home without that essential USF T-shirt
or all-important blaster gun, you can call % 407-224-5800 and the
Universal Mail Order Department will help. Just let them know
what the item is, where it’s located, and they can arrange to have it
shipped to you house (for a fee, of course).
Exploring the Top Attractions
Universal matches Disney stride for stride, and in some cases is a half-
step ahead, when it comes to cutting-edge rides. Real and virtual thrills,
terrific special effects, mammoth screens, and 3-D action are all part of
its successful mix.
The rides and shows at Universal are located in six distinctive sets:
Hollywood, New York, Production Central, San Francisco/Amity,
Woody Woodpecker’s KidZone, and World Expo. The Front Lot serves
as the park’s main entrance. Universal is much better than Disney at
keeping you occupied while you’re standing in line. Elaborate surround-
ings and entertaining preshows, some of which are just as amusing or
interesting as the main event, make the wait more bearable. Most of the
lines are under cover from the sun, with the occasional water spritzer or
drinking fountain nearby. Although these extras may not initially seem
like a big deal, it makes your time in line far more tolerable.
The “Universal Studios Florida” map, found on page 264, will help you
visualize the layout of the park.
Hollywood
Hollywood is to the right of the Front Lot, and its main streets include
Rodeo Drive, Hollywood Boulevard, and Sunset Boulevard, all lined 
with ornate buildings in soft hues, much like you would have found in
Hollywood’s heyday so many years ago. Here’s a list of the best that
Hollywood has to offer:
 Lucy — A Tribute: This show is a remembrance of America’s queen
of comedy, Lucille Ball. If you love Lucy, it’s a must, filled with memo-
rabilia and a really neat interactive trivia game, but if you’re pressed
for time or have a handful of smaller kids along, it’s skippable.
 Terminator 2: 3D Battle Across Time: This attraction is billed as
“the quintessential sight and sound experience for the 21st cen-
tury!” and the park has little need to be modest about its claim. 
The movie’s director, Jim Cameron, supervised this $60-million 
Chapter 18: Universal Studios Florida 269

production, which combines 3-D film, live action, and sensory
effects into a seamless winner. After a slower start (the preshow
sets up a pre-Terminator story line), it builds to one of the best
action shows in town. Live actors and six giant cyborgs interact
with the Governator himself, who appears on-screen (actually three
huge screens). The crisp 3-D effects are among the best in Orlando.
(When liquid mercury falls from the screen, cold water really hits
your legs.)
“All the action was so cool, and the motorcycle and special effects
were amazing. I thought for sure the hand that came out into the
audience was going to grab me,” says 13-year-old Ryan. The show,
however, is rated PG-13, Universal’s way of saying violence and
loud noises may make it unsuitable for preteens. Younger children
may find the crashing and flying 3-D effects (in conjunction with a
few of the sensory effects) too intense.
 Universal Horror Make-Up Show: This show, which is loaded with
corny humor, gives you a behind-the-scenes look at the wizardry
behind Hollywood’s monster makeup. It also takes an up-close look
at some cinematic makeup masterpieces, including the transforma-
tion scenes from such movies as The Fly and The Exorcist. It, too, is
rated PG-13, mostly due to the scary on-screen characters.
Keep your eyes and ears open as you make your way along Hollywood
Boulevard — you may be in for a treat. Lucy and Ricky liven things up
while singing and dancing through the studio streets and entertaining
the crowds as their seven-piece band plays traditional Cuban rhythms.
New York
New York is near the back of the park and includes rides and shows set
among mock-ups of 42nd and 57th streets, Park Avenue, and Delancey
Street. The premiere attractions in this section are
 The Blues Brothers: This foot-stomping revue takes to the street
(Delancey Street, actually) five times a day. Clap along as Jake and
Elwood, the “bad boys of the blues,” belt out a medley of their
greatest hits.
 TWISTER . . . Ride It Out: This windy incarnation of Earthquake —
The Big One (discussed below) packs quite a wallop. Based on 
the hit film, the curtain rises on the movie town of Wakita, where
Universal engineers have created a five-story funnel cloud by inject-
ing 2 million cubic feet of air per minute. (That’s enough to fill four
full-size blimps.) The sensory elements are pretty incredible. Power
lines spark and fall, an oak tree splits, and the storm rumbles at rock-
concert level as cars, trucks, and a cow fly about while the audience
watches from only 20 feet away. In the finale, the floor begins to
buckle at your feet. The only downside is that you tend to get way
too much water whipped at your face (it is tornado, after all).
Part V: Exploring the Rest of Orlando 
270

“You don’t really ride anything as much as walk through it, but it
was pretty intense,” 9-year-old Nicolas offered. It’s similar to the
Backdraft attraction at Universal Studios Hollywood, though that
California attraction is (sacrilege!) actually a bit better than this
one. TWISTER doesn’t have a minimum height, but it carries
Universal’s PG-13 rating, meaning it may be a little too intense for
younger children.
Production Central
Production Central is directly behind and to the left of the Front Lot. Its
main thoroughfares are Nickelodeon Way, Plaza of the Stars, and 7th and
8th avenues. Here are some of the area’s highlights:
 Jimmy Neutron’s Nicktoon Blast: Launched in 2003, this ride is
based on the movie Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius. Here, you climb
aboard a Mark IV rocket, and motion-simulator technology and
sophisticated computer graphics send you on a spinning, careening
adventure that includes a battle against Yokians — evil, egg-shaped
aliens. The attraction also features characters from several popular
cartoons, including Rugrats and Fairly Odd Parents. If you feel any
twinge of motion sickness, simply look at any stationary object
within the large theater.
Chapter 18: Universal Studios Florida 271
Revenge of the Mummy
Kongfrontation, long a fixture at Universal Studios Florida, closed in September 2002
(did they forget a King Kong movie was in production?) to make room for the spring
2004 opening of Revenge of the Mummy the Ride in the New York section of the park.
Billed as a “psychological thrill ride,” the $40-million indoor roller coaster relies on
speed, pyrotechnics, and robotics to induce screams as riders hurtle through the elab-
orate Egyptian sets, passageways, and tombs in cars that move forward and even in
reverse. Even the preshow for the waiting victims — riders, I mean riders — lends to
the ominous atmosphere and includes several surprise interactive areas and a story
line that plays out as you get closer to boarding the ride.
The five-minute journey aims to prey on your inner phobias via encounters with over-
head flames, pitch-black darkness, insects, and a skeletal warrior that hops aboard
your coaster. Does it work? Yes — and how. Even the most-manly man in my coaster
car was screaming, though you’d have had a fat chance of getting him to admit it after-
ward. The best confession I got was when a friend admitted that he hasn’t freaked out
on a ride like that since the first time he rode the Twilight Zone Tower of Terror (see
Chapter 14) over ten years ago. So if you have any severe phobias or medical condi-
tions, pay attention to the warnings posted, and don’t even think about getting aboard.
Coaster-lovers of all ages will likely make this one tops on their list. You must be at
least 48 inches tall to ride.

“It was cool, just like being part of the TV show. The Chicken Dance
was pretty funny, too,” said Nicolas (age 9). His younger sister,
Hailey (age 7), and younger brother, Davis (age 5), were equally
impressed with this very kid-friendly ride. That said, kids do need
to be at least 40 inches tall to ride. There is a small area near the
front for those who would prefer to skip the moving spaceships.
 Shrek 4-D: In spring 2003, Universal opened this 4-D fractured fairy-
tale based on the hit movie Shrek. A 15-minute show, it can be seen,
heard, felt, and smelled thanks to 3-D film, motion simulators,
OgreVision glasses, and other special effects, including water
spritzers. The attraction picks up where the movie leaves off —
enabling you to join Shrek and Princess Fiona on their honeymoon
(which, predictably, gets interrupted by the evil Lord Farquaad).
Fractured or not, you know this one will have a happy ending, and
it’s similar in style to Disney’s It’s Tough to Be a Bug (see Chapter
15) and “Honey, I Shrunk the Kids” (see Chapter 14). But, as with
all of the Universal rides, it’s a bit edgier all around. The preshow 
is one of the funniest in the park and is as good as the show itself.
The line can stretch for miles — and the show doesn’t accept
Express passes — but at least you’ll wait under cover from the sun.
“Awesome! Except the spiders freaked me out,” 11-year-old Austin
giggled. Kids not into sensory effects may get freaked out as well.
This ride can also be rather bumpy, but the front row has station-
ary seats for those who need them.
San Francisco
San Francisco faces the waterfront, and its attractions line the
Embarcadero and Amity Avenue.
 Beetlejuice’s Graveyard Revue: Dracula, Wolfman, the Phantom of
the Opera, Frankenstein and his bride, and Beetlejuice show up to
scare you silly. Their funky rock musical has pyrotechnic special
effects and MTV-style choreography. It’s loud and lively enough to
aggravate some older adults and scare small children, and it carries
Universal’s PG-13 rating. Young teens seem to like it the most.
 Earthquake — The Big One: Sparks fly shortly after you board a
Bay Area Rapid Transit (better known as BART) train ostensibly run-
ning from San Francisco (the real one) to Oakland. The whopper —
8.3 on the Richter scale! — hits as you pull into the Embarcadero
Station, and you’re left trapped as vast slabs of concrete collapse
around you, a propane truck bursts into flames, a runaway train
comes hurtling at you, and the station floods (65,000 gallons of
water cascade down the steps). Prior to the ride, you find out how
Earthquake, the Oscar-winning movie, was made and take a look at a
$2.4-million set model. You then shuffle off to a soundstage where
seven adult volunteers help re-create the big one for you.
 Fear Factor Live: Based on the hit NBC reality TV show, this brand-
new show takes center stage. Contestants (who are actual Universal
Part V: Exploring the Rest of Orlando 
272

Studios guests age 18 and older and who meet certain height, weight,
and health restrictions) face some of their greatest fears in front of
thousands of people. They’ll go head to head with other competi-
tors, each trying to outdo the other in order to be proclaimed the
winner. The wild stunts, similar to what you’ve seen on the television
show, test both their physical and emotional limits — not to mention
their stomachs. Leave it to Universal to be the first to transform a
blockbuster reality-TV show into the hottest new attraction around.
Note that although this show is officially part of San Francisco, it’s
actually located directly to the left of Men in Black near the World
Expo area of the park.
Austin (age 11), a fan of the TV show, looked over and whispered
“I’m sooooooo glad I didn’t volunteer. . . . Bet they didn’t expect
they would have to drink that stuff [referring to a lumpy, gray, slimy
“beverage”] when they did!”
 JAWS: As your boat heads into a 7-acre, 5-million-gallon lagoon, an
ominous dorsal fin appears on the horizon (and the blockbuster
film’s famous score starts to run through your brain). What follows
is a series of attacks by a 3-ton, 32-foot-long, mechanical great
white shark that tries to sink its urethane teeth into your hide — 
or at least into your boat’s hide. A 30-foot wall of flame caused by
burning fuel surrounds your ride, and you’ll truly feel the heat at
this $45-million attraction.
The effects of this ride are definitely more startling after dark;
during the day, it’s too easy to see the shark coming. And though
the attraction doesn’t have any height limitations, you may want 
to think twice before bringing along the 5-and-younger crowd.
Woody Woodpecker’s KidZone
Woody Woodpecker’s KidZone contains rides and attractions sure to
please the littlest members of your party. When you’re traveling with
young children, plan on spending plenty of time here. Highlights include
 A Day in the Park with Barney: This musical is Universal’s sadistic
answer to Disney’s “it’s a small world”; one of those attractions
that eats the brains and ignites the nerves of anyone but 2- to 6-
year-olds and their loving parents. Set in a parklike theater-in-the-
round, this 25-minute musical stars the Purple One, Baby Bop, and
BJ. It uses song, dance, and interactive play to deliver an environ-
mental message. This show can be the highlight of your youngster’s
day. The playground next door has chimes to ring, tree houses to
explore, and more.
 E.T. Adventure: You soar with E.T., who is on a mission to save his
ailing planet, through the forest and into space aboard a star-bound
bicycle. You also meet some new characters that Steven Spielberg
created for the ride, including Botanicus, Tickli Moot Moot, Horn
Flowers, and Tympani Tremblies. It’s a family-friendly charmer. A
Chapter 18: Universal Studios Florida 273

cool, wooded forest serves to create one of the most pleasant waits
for any ride in central Florida, although you have to endure two
lines before you actually make it onto the ride.
 Woody Woodpecker’s Nuthouse Coaster: This ride is the top
attraction in the KidZone, an 8-acre concession Universal Studios
made after being criticized for having too little for young visitors.
Sure, it’s a kiddie coaster, but the Nuthouse Coaster will thrill some
moms and dads, too. Although it’s only 30 feet at its peak, this ride
offers quick, banked turns while you sit in a miniature steam train.
It’s very much like the Barnstormer at Goofy’s Wiseacre Farm in
Magic Kingdom (see Chapter 12).
The ride lasts only 55 seconds, and you can wait as long as 40 min-
utes, but your children probably won’t let you skip it if they see it.
It has a 36-inch height minimum, and kids have to be 48 inches or
taller to ride without an adult.
There’s even more to do in Woody Woodpecker’s KidZone. Fievel’s
Playland is a wet, Western-themed playground with a house to climb
and a small water slide. Curious George Goes to Town has water- and
ball-shooting cannons, plus a huge water tower that empties (after an
alarm), drenching anyone who doesn’t run for cover.
World Expo
The smallest zone in Universal Studios Florida packs a bunch of punch.
World Expo is on Exposition Boulevard, between San Francisco/Amity
and KidZone. The top attractions here are
 Back to the Future The Ride: This ride has more warnings than a
centipede has legs. Topping the list, of course: If you have a prob-
lem with motion sickness, don’t get on. If you don’t have a problem
with motion sickness, but do have a problem with other people get-
ting motion sick on you, you may want to invest in one of the rain
ponchos sold at most Universal souvenir stands. (No sense ruining
your new Mickey — um, Barney — shirt, right?) Other warnings are
posted for would-be riders who are pregnant or become dizzy, and
for those who are claustrophobic or have neck, heart, or back prob-
lems. These warnings are all justified.
Back to the Future offers you a chance at time travel in a simulator
made to look like the movie’s famous DeLorean. You’re herded into
your car after a video briefing from Dr. Emmett Brown (actor
Christopher Lloyd). Biff the Bully has stolen another DeLorean, and
you have to catch him. The fate of the universe is in your hands.
Along the way, you’ll dive into blazing volcanic tunnels, collide with
Ice Age glaciers, thunder through caves and canyons, and briefly get
swallowed by a dinosaur in an eye-crossing multisensory adventure.
You twist, you turn, you dip, you dive — all the while feeling like
you’re really flying. 
Part V: Exploring the Rest of Orlando 
274

“Wow,” 13-year-old Ryan said, adding that he noticed that the taller
people were hitting their heads in the back row. If this describes
you, request one of the front seats that don’t have overhead cover.
By the way, riders must be 40 inches or taller to get aboard.
 Men in Black Alien Attack: You and your mates have to blast the
bug-eyes, or the end of the world may be at hand. You buzz the
streets of New York in six-passenger cruisers, using your “zapper”
to splatter up to 120 bug-eyed targets. You have to contend with
return fire and distractions (noise, clouds of liquid nitrogen, and
such), any of which can send you spinning out of control. Your
laser-tag–style gun fires infrared bullets. Earn a bonus by hitting
Frank the Pug (to the right, just past the alien shipwreck). The four-
minute ride relies on 360-degree spins and some scary looking
insects rather than speed for its thrill factor. Near the end, you’re
swallowed by a giant roach (it’s 30 ft. tall with 8-ft. fangs and 20-ft.
claws) that explodes — dousing you with bug guts (actually warm
water) — as you blast your way to safety and into the pest-control
hall of fame. After you survive unscathed (well, maybe a trifle wet),
Will Smith rates you anywhere from a galaxy defender to bug bait.
(There are 38 possible scores.)
Men in Black often has a much shorter line for single riders. If
you’re not alone but are willing to be split up, get in this line and
you will usually be able to hop right on a vehicle that has fewer
than six passengers.
“I loved blasting those gigantic bugs, and the spinning made it 
even more fun.” Twelve-year-old Ryan clearly didn’t end up as bug
bait. This $70-million ride-through video game has a 42-inch height
minimum.
 Universal 360 — A Cinesphere Spectacular: Universal has lagged
behind Disney in the evening entertainment department . . . that is,
until this show debuted in the summer of 2006. Spread across the
park’s central lagoon, lasers project colorful scenes from some of
Universal’s biggest blockbuster movies onto two tremendous four-
story-high spheres (hence, the term cinesphere in the show’s title).
Flashing lights, pyrotechnic effects, and an original musical score
blasting from 300 outdoor speakers all add to the experience. Word
has it that various versions of the sound-and-light spectacular may
be “projected” during Halloween Horror Nights, as well as through-
out the winter holidays.
Grabbing a Bite to Eat
Universal Studios Florida has more than a dozen places to eat, with
offerings that range from lobster to corn dogs. Quality-wise, things
inside the park are on the same level as those found in the Disney parks
(see Chapters 11–15), meaning that they’re generally overpriced for the
quality you receive. Here are my favorites by category:
Chapter 18: Universal Studios Florida 275

 Best Sit-Down Meal: Lombard’s Seafood Grille, across from
Earthquake — The Big One, has a hearty fried-clam basket, 
lobster, steak, pasta, and burgers ($11–$30).
 Best Counter Service: Universal Studios’ Classic Monsters Cafe
is one of the newer eateries in the park and serves salads, pizza,
pasta, and rotisserie chicken ($7–$15). It’s off 7th Avenue near
Shrek 4-D.
 Best Place for Hungry Families: Similar to a mall food court, the
International Food and Film Festival offers a variety of food in one
location. With options ranging from stir-fry to fajitas, this is a place
where a family can split up and still eat under one roof. The food is
far from gourmet, but it is a cut above regular fast food ($7–$13).
It’s located behind Animal Planet Live!, near the lagoon and the
entrance to Back to the Future The Ride.
 Best Places for Snacks: Grab a malt ($4) and enjoy the classic atmos-
phere of Mel’s Drive-In, located across from the Universal Horror
Make-Up Show. The San Francisco Pastry Co., located across from
Earthquake — The Big One, has a glass case full of sweet treats,
including a large and decadent chocolate brownie. Brody’s Ice
Cream Shoppe, near JAWS on Amity Avenue in San Francisco, and
Schwab’s Pharmacy, about halfway along Hollywood Boulevard,
both offer plenty of ice cream treats to cool you off on a hot day.
See Chapter 10 for the best places to grab a bite at Universal’s CityWalk.
Shopping at Universal Studios Florida
If Disney can do it, Universal can, too. Most major attractions at Universal
have a theme store attached. Just as at Disney, the prices are high, when
you consider you’re just buying a T-shirt or trinket.
More than 25 other shops in the park sell souvenirs ranging from 
I Love Lucy collectibles to Men in Black souvenirs. Be warned, however,
that, unlike WDW, these shops are even more specific to individual
attractions — if you see something you like, buy it. You probably won’t
see it in another store even throughout the park itself. Here’s a sampling
of the more unusual gifts available at some of the Universal stores:
 Back to the Future — The Store: Real fans of the movie series find
plenty of intriguing stuff here. One of the more interesting is a
miniature version of the Back to the Future DeLorean.
 E.T.’s Toy Closet and Photo Spot: This is the place for plush,
stuffed animals, including a replica of the alien namesake.
 MIB Gear: Clothes, T-shirts, and everything else the well-dressed
alien should own — oh, and the cool shades that are the staple of
the Men in Black uniform.
Part V: Exploring the Rest of Orlando 
276

 Quint’s Surf Shack: This is the place to go if you plan on hanging
ten in the future. It’s got all the latest surfing apparel.
 Sahara Traders: A wide range of Egyptian-themed items and
Revenge of the Mummy souvenirs near, you guessed it, Revenge 
of the Mummy the Ride.
 Silver Screen Collectibles: Fans of I Love Lucy will adore the small
variety of collector dolls. There’s also a Betty Boop line. And how
can you pass up a Bates Motel shower curtain?
 Universal Studios Store: This store, near the entrance, sells just
about everything when it comes to Universal apparel. It’s also the
spot to pick up your packages if you’ve had them delivered from
another store.

U
niversal’s second theme park opened in 1999 with a vibrantly col-
ored, cleverly themed collection of edgy, fast, and fun rides. Heart-
pounding roller coasters thunder above (and, in one case, dives below)
its pedestrian walkways, water rides careen through the center of the
park, and uniquely themed restaurants are camouflaged to match their
surroundings, adding to your overall immersion in the various “islands”
in this adventure.
From the wobbly angles and day-glo colors of Seuss Landing to the 
lush foliage and distant rumblings of gigantic beasts in Jurassic Park,
Universal does an incredible job of differentiating between the various
islands. As if you’ve been transported through a portal, each island com-
pletely envelops you in its theme, and within only steps, you have no
idea that any of the other islands exist. Navigation is far easier than at its
sister park (Universal Studios Florida) where the studio’s sets often blend
together, making it difficult to tell when you’ve left New York and entered
San Francisco. At Islands of Adventure, almost the entire park, save the
Port of Entry, surrounds the central sea. Between each island, a simple
walkway creates a bridge from one island to the next.
This billion-dollar park is divided into six islands; beginning with the Port
of Entry, you find a marketplace filled with shops, bazaars, and eateries
all occupying a street designed to recall ancient far-off lands and exotic
ports of call. The remaining islands include: Seuss Landing, where you
feel as if you’ve jumped into the pages of the good doctor’s whimsical
classic tales; The Lost Continent, which combines mythical and mystical
enchantments; Jurassic Park, where you enter through a massive stone
gateway, are surrounded by towering dense foliage, and can hear the rum-
blings of gigantic prehistoric beasts off in the distance; Toon Lagoon,
which takes you on an amusing, lighthearted stroll through the classic

Sunday comic strips of the past; and Marvel Super Hero Island, where
super heroes and their arch nemeses jump off the pages of comic books
to entertain and impress with their super powers. Each of the islands is
listed in further detail throughout this chapter.
Islands of Adventure boasts an incredible collection of thrill rides and
coasters, with a more modest selection of play areas and somewhat
tamer rides for younger adventurers. It’s unquestionably the best park 
in town for tweens, teens, and adrenaline junkies. The trade-off is that
the park features only a few shows and stage productions.
Knowing Essential Park Information
Before you embark on your journey through the park’s rides and attrac-
tions, here are some mundane matters that you may need to know.
Buying tickets and making reservations
You can choose from several ticket options and tours:
 A one-day ticket costs $67 (plus 6.5 percent sales tax) for adults,
$56 for children 3 to 9.
 A two-day, two-park, bonus pass is $110 for adults and kids alike,
with kids younger than 3 admitted free. These passes enable you to
move between Islands of Adventure and Universal Studios Florida
(see Chapter 18) throughout the day, so you can go back and forth
whenever you like. Note: For a limited time, if you buy your bonus
pass online (www.universalorlando.com), you get two more days
for free, for a total of four consecutive days of admission. Bonus
passes also give you free access at night to select CityWalk clubs
(see Chapter 25).
 Annual Passes (the Preferred Annual Pass and the Power Pass)
allow entry to the park for an entire year (some blackout dates
apply to the Power Pass; there are no blackout dates with the
Preferred Annual Pass). The costs are $180 and $120, respectively.
For more details, check out www.universalorlando.com.
 The FlexTicket multiday, multipark option is the most economical
way to see the various “other-than-Disney” parks. You pay one
price to visit any and all of the participating parks during a 14-day
period. A four-park pass to Islands of Adventure, Universal Studios
Florida, Wet ’n Wild, and SeaWorld is $190 for adults and $156 for
children 3 to 9. A five-park pass, which adds Busch Gardens in
Tampa, is $235 for adults and $200 for kids. You can order the

Universal Orlando’s Islands of Adventure is about half a mile north of 
I-4’s Kirkman Road/Highway 435 exit. You may find construction in the
area, so keep an eye out for the road signs directing you to Universal
Orlando.
Islands of Adventure is open 365 days a year, generally from at least 9 a.m.
to 6 or 7 p.m. Closing hours vary seasonally with peak-season and holiday
hours extended later into the evening; special activities inside the park
often extend the hours as well. For example, during Halloween Horror
Nights, which is celebrated at both parks, the park closes around 5 p.m.,
reopens at around 7 p.m. (with a new admission fee), and remains open
until at least midnight.
Locating special services and facilities
In case you forgot to bring essential items, or if you need special assis-
tance while at the park, here’s a list of services and facilities that may
come in handy:
 ATMs: You can find machines accepting cards from banks using 
the Cirrus, STAR, and PLUS systems outside and to the right of the
park’s entrance and in the Lost Continent near Mythos Restaurant,
as well as near the bridge to Jurassic Park. In Marvel Super Hero
Island, you’ll find one near the Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man.
 Baby-changing and nursing facilities: Diaper-changing stations are
located in all the restrooms. You can find nursing facilities at the

Family Services located in the Guest Services building at the Port
of Entry, but they don’t sell any infant or toddler supplies like dia-
pers, formula, or pacifiers, so make sure you come prepared with
enough provisions.
 Cameras and film: Buy film and disposable cameras at De Foto’s
Expedition Photography, inside the main entrance to the right.
Digital supplies are rather limited.
 Universal Express Plus: To take advantage of Universal’s version 
of Disney’s FASTPASS you have to pay for your park tickets plus the
Express Pass. The passes are available for purchase online or at 
the park, but they (like the freebies at Disney) run out, often by
midday, sometimes earlier, during peak seasons. The pass allows
access to the Express line at each and every attraction that accepts
the Express Pass without having to continually obtain separate
passes or wait for any time limits to expire before heading to the
Express line at the next attraction. The downside is that it can only
be used once at each of the attractions. The price varies and can
run between $15 and $50 per ticket depending on whether it’s good
for one or both of the Universal parks and what date the pass is
valid for. Visit www.universalorlando.com for all the details.
Universal offers a separate line-beating option to visitors staying at
any of the three Universal hotels. Guests of the Portofino Bay Hotel,
Hard Rock Hotel, and Royal Pacific Resort just have to show their
room keys for Express-line access to the rides and front-of-the-line
access to most of the restaurants.
 First aid: You can find First Aid Stations just inside and to the right
of the main entrance in the Port of Entry as well as in the Lost
Continent, across from Oasis Coolers.
 Lockers: Rent lockers for $8 and $10 a day. Lockers are a smart
place to keep valuables that you may lose on the wilder rides, and
Islands of Adventure even provides lockers near the entrances to
the Incredible Hulk Coaster, Dueling Dragons, and Jurassic Park
River Adventure; the first 45 minutes are free and every hour there-
after is $2 (with a $14 maximum). Be sure to read the instructions
carefully when using the newer electronic lockers — otherwise,
you’ll spend valuable time tracking down a park attendant to help
retrieve your gear instead of riding the rides.
 Lost children: If you lose a child, grab the nearest staff member,
and he or she will direct you to the “found children” area, usually
the Guest Services or Security area. Make sure children younger
than 7 wear name tags inside their clothing for easy identification.
 Parking: If you park in the multilevel garages, be sure to write down
the level, character, row, and space number so you can find your car
later. Parking costs $10 for cars and trucks. Valet parking is available
for $16. If you arrive after 6 p.m., parking is free. Universal’s garages
Part V: Exploring the Rest of Orlando 
282

are connected to its parks by walkways and a series of moving side-
walks; reaching the gates can take a while.
 Car assistance: If you need assistance with your car, raise the hood
and tell any parking attendant your location, or use the call boxes
located throughout the garage to call for security. The park pro-
vides battery jumps for free.
 Pet care: You can leave your small animals at the Studio Kennel in
the parking garages for $10 a day (no overnight stays), but you’ll
have to feed and walk them throughout the day. Ask the parking
attendant to direct you to the kennel.
 Strollers: Look to the left as you enter the park through the turn-
stiles. Stroller rental costs $10 for a single, $16 for a double, tax
included.
 Wheelchairs: You can rent wheelchairs for $12 per day in the park-
ing-garage concourse. Electric wheelchairs are $40 per day. Both
require a $50 deposit and a signed rental agreement. Prices include
taxes.
Practical Advice for Island Adventurers
If you want to get the most out of your adventure, you would do well 
to keep the following tips in mind when you’re exploring the Islands of
Adventure:
 Keep in mind that, of the 14 major rides at Islands of Adventure,
13 of them have minimum-height restrictions between 40 and 54
inches. You can find a child-swap service at all major attractions,
enabling you or your partner to ride while the other watches over
your tykes, but sitting in a waiting room isn’t much fun for them.
Take your child’s height into consideration before visiting the park,
or consider splitting up for part of the day. Islands actually has a
few fun play areas that will keep younger kids entertained while
older kids and parents ride some of the wilder rides.
In recent years Universal added two notable attractions to its lineup
as an answer to criticism that Islands of Adventure had too little for
young guests. The Flying Unicorn is a small roller coaster that trav-
els through a mythical forest. (It’s comparable to the Barnstormer at
Goofy’s Wiseacre Farm in Disney’s Magic Kingdom [see Chapter 12]
and Woody Woodpecker’s Nuthouse Coaster at Universal Studios
Florida [see Chapter 18], though it still has plenty of zip.) Storm
Force Accelatron is a spinning attraction in which guests help the 
X-Men’s Storm harness the weather to fight her archenemy, Magneto.
It’s a bit wilder and definitely edgier in its theme than the Mad Tea
Party at Magic Kingdom (Chapter 12), but the idea’s the same.
 See the preceding note about short visitors and add the warning
that height isn’t the only limiting factor. If you’re pregnant, prone
Chapter 19: Islands of Adventure 283

to dizziness or motion sickness, or have heart, back, or other health
problems, this may not be the best choice of parks for you. Consider
heading to a tamer park, like Magic Kingdom (see Chapter 12),
Disney’s Animal Kingdom (see Chapter 15), Epcot (see Chapter 13),
Disney–MGM Studios (see Chapter 14), SeaWorld (see Chapter 20),
or even Universal Studios Florida (see Chapter 18).
 If you hauled your stroller on your vacation, bring it to the park.
The walk from your car is a long one, through the parking garage
and the entertainment district’s CityWalk, before you get to the
attractions. Carrying a young child and all of his or her accompany-
ing paraphernalia, even on moving sidewalks, can make the long
trek seem even longer.
 Beat the heat. Several rides have lengthy pathways outside that
offer no cover from the sizzling Florida sun. Bring some bottled
water with you for the long waits (a bottle that costs $2.50 here 
is less than $1 in the outside world) or take a sip from fountains
placed in the waiting areas. Alcohol is more readily available at this
park than at Disney, so remember that liquor, roller coasters, and
sweltering heat can make for a very messy mix.
Exploring the Top Attractions 
at Islands of Adventure
Islands of Adventure features more than 20 rides and attractions, as well
as numerous uniquely-themed restaurants and shops, all surrounding its
central sea. (It’s similar in layout to the World Showcase at Epcot [see
Chapter 13].)
See the “Islands of Adventure” map on page 281 to locate all the attrac-
tions in the sections that follow.
Port of Entry
Beyond the gigantic, crumbling-stone archway, you’ll find the Port’s
numerous souvenir shops, bazaars, and eateries lining the exotic
streetscape. Save this area for last (unless you’re in need of nourishment
to start you on your way), spending only a few minutes now to take in
your surroundings, because the architecture and attention to detail is
striking.
I suggest you begin your adventure just beyond the second stone arch-
way by heading to either Seuss Landing (to the right) or Marvel Super
Hero Island (to the left). Your direction will likely be determined by the
age of your children, or whether you’re willing to start out by riding one
of the most intense and thrilling rides in the entire park.
Part V: Exploring the Rest of Orlando 
284

Seuss Landing
Within these 10 fanciful acres, you step onto the pages of Dr. Seuss’s
classic tales, complete with Seussian signature color swirls and whimsi-
cal architecture and a cast of classic characters. The main attractions in
Seuss Landing are aimed at the younger set, although anyone who loved
the good doctor as a child will enjoy some nostalgic fun.
 Caro-Seuss-el: This not-so-ordinary carousel replaces the tradi-
tional wooden horses with seven whimsical Seussian characters 
(a total of 54 mounts), including Cowfish, the elephant birds from
Horton Hatches the Egg, and Mulligatawnies. They move up and
down and in and out. Pull the reins to make their eyes blink or
heads bob.
This ride has a rocking-chariot platform and a wheelchair-loading
system that makes it a fun attraction for guests with disabilities.
 The Cat in the Hat Ride: All aboard the couch! In this case, the
couches are six-passenger futons that steer you through 18 silly
scenes, retelling the tale of a day gone terribly south. Seuss fans will
recognize the giant candy-striped hat looming over the entrance, as
well as the chaotic journey itself. The ride’s highlight is a revolving
24-foot tunnel that alters your perceptions and leaves you feeling a
bit woozy. My only complaint is that the audio is somewhat muffled,
making it difficult to hear the story as it’s broadcast throughout the
ride.
“Are you kidding? It’s not fast at all, and The Cat in the Hat — it’s a
little-kids’ story,” was 13-year-old Ryan’s verdict. The Cat in the 
Hat Ride is one of the signature “young” experiences of Islands 
of Adventure, and because of this, you — as well as your older 
children — may find it a bit tame. Small children may be slightly
unsettled by the pop-up characters, although most kids ages 4 to 7
will find it a winner.
 The High in the Sky Seuss Trolley Train Ride!: After seven years
of not klonking or bonking, jerking or berking, the mini-monorail
hanging high over Seuss Landing is once again taking guests of all
ages on a whimsical journey through several classic Seussian sto-
ries and way up high in the sky over Seuss Landing.
 If I Ran the Zoo: At this small interactive play area, kids can dodge
flying water snakes and tickle the toes of a Seussian creature. The
area is filled with 19 play stations that include slides, wheels to
spin, caves to explore, and other things geared to burning off some
of the excited energy of tinier tots. Just plan on them getting wet —
that’s half the fun!
 One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish: You move “up, up, up”
and “down, down, down” on this attraction, where you ride in a
funky flying fish whose controls enable you to ascend or descend
Chapter 19: Islands of Adventure 285

15 feet as you spin around on an arm attached to a hub (much like
Magic Kingdom’s Magic Carpets of Aladdin [see Chapter 12]).
Watch out for squirt posts, which spray unsuspecting riders who
don’t follow along with the ride’s little rhyme (and sometimes even
the ones who do follow it).
Marvel Super Hero Island
Thrill-ride junkies love the twisting, turning, stomach-churning rides on
this island. The streets are filled with giant-size murals of Marvel Super
Heroes, making you feel as if you’ve stepped onto the pages of a gigantic
comic book. The larger-than-life scenery was created using a special
effect that mimics Marvel’s style. The hard rockin’ music here is loud —
definitely a reflection of the island’s overall personality.
 The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man: This primo ride com-
bines moving vehicles, 3-D action, and an array of special effects
themed around the original web master. The script: While you’re 
on a ho-hum tour of the Daily Bugle newspaper — yikes! — the 
boys in black hats (Doc Oc, Hobgoblin, and the rest of the Sinister
Syndicate) filch the Statue of Liberty. You have to help Spidey get it
back. Unlike the many roller coasters and stationary motion simula-
tors in Orlando, this ride offers a unique experience. Passengers
squeal as real and computer-generated objects fly toward their 12-
person cars, which plunge and spin through a comic-book universe.
A simulated 400-foot drop feels an awful lot like the real thing.
Expectant mothers or those with heart, neck, or back problems
shouldn’t ride the Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man. For those
who can, know that lines here can get ridiculously long. If you hold
a Universal Express Plus pass, you’ll save yourself from a long wait;
otherwise, if you don’t mind splitting up your party, use the faster
single-rider line when it’s available.
“This was the coolest ride ever!” exclaimed Austin (age 11). Ryan
(age 13) echoed that sentiment, adding, “You gotta do this one a
couple times at least!” Dark scenes, the motion of the car, the in-
your-face 3-D effects, and the simulated motion make this ride
unsuitable for extremely young kids and even some preteens
(though Hailey, age 7, had a blast, riding it a second time later that
day). Most of the rest of you will probably want to give it another
spin — a number of Universal employees rate it the best in the
park. Keep in mind that you can close your eyes if a scene is too
intense, as the motion of the car, without the combined effects,
isn’t overwhelming by itself. There’s a 40-inch height minimum.
 Doctor Doom’s Fearfall: Look! Up in the sky! It’s a bird, it’s a 
plane . . . uh, it’s you falling 200 feet if you’re courageous enough to
climb aboard. This towering metal skeleton provides screams that
you can hear far into the day and night. The plot: You’re touring a
lab when — are you sensing a theme here? — something goes hor-
ribly wrong as supervillain Doctor Doom tries to drain you of fear
Part V: Exploring the Rest of Orlando 
286

in order to power his latest evil scheme. You’re fired to the top of
the ride (pulling 4 Gs in the process), with feet dangling, and then
you’re dropped in intervals, leaving your stomach at several levels.
If you’re an expectant mother or you experience heart, neck, or
back problems, you shouldn’t ride Doctor Doom’s Fearfall. Make
sure all items are secured well — or better yet, give them to some-
one not riding for safekeeping. Plenty of riders have ended up
watching their sunglasses fly off into the wild blue yonder upon lift
off. Minimum height is 52 inches. Though it’s actually less nightmar-
ish than Twilight Zone Tower of Terror (see Chapter 14), I recom-
mend kids be a minimum of 10 years of age before even attempting
this one.
After Austin (age 11) regrouped and got his legs back he said, 
“Well . . . it’s pretty good . . . but not at all as cool and creepy as the
Tower of Terror at Disney.” He also noted that he didn’t like sitting
in an outside seat.
 The Incredible Hulk Coaster: Bruce Banner is working in his lab
when — yes, again — something goes wrong. This coaster rockets
from a dark tunnel into the sunlight, while accelerating from 0 to 
40 mph in 2 seconds. Universal’s scriptwriters insist that it has the
same thrust as an F-16. Although it’s only two-thirds the speed of
Disney–MGM’s Rock ’n’ Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith, this
ride is in broad daylight, and you can see the asphalt! After you’re
launched, you spin upside down 128 feet from the ground, feel
weightless, and careen through the center of the park over the
heads of other visitors. If you’re a coaster lover, you’ll be pleased
to know that this ride, which lasts 2 minutes and 15 seconds,
includes seven rollovers and two deep drops. As a nice touch, the
32-passenger metal coaster glows green at night. The ride is sur-
prisingly smooth, making it much more comfortable than coasters
that are far less intense.
Expectant mothers or those with heart, neck, or back problems
shouldn’t ride. I’ve seen people ignore the warnings, only to turn
the same shade as the coaster. This is also another one where you
should heed warnings to store all loose items in a locker before you
get on . . . or finding your car at the end of the day may become a
moot point when your car keys go flying.
Mixed reviews for this “monster” of a coaster from my young
reviewers. “No way. Uh-uh, you go upside down — you won’t even
get me on it,” were 13-year-old Ryan’s final words on the subject.
But Nicolas (age 9) and Austin (age 11) both coaster crazies, agreed
that it was “the most amazing roller coaster ever — you think
you’re going to hit the pavement, but then you don’t — it’s fast and
really smooth.” This is another ride that I think is best for riders 10
to 12 years and older. Riders must be at least 54 inches tall to climb
aboard. Another coaster crazy — this one an adult — who rides
Chapter 19: Islands of Adventure 287

them all (and I mean all) thought it was one of the best he’d ever
ridden thanks to the extremely smooth ride.
 Storm Force Accelatron: This ride is a 22nd-century version of
Magic Kingdom’s Mad Tea Party and its spinning teacups. While
aboard, you and the X-Men’s superheroine, Storm, try to defeat the
evil Magneto. To do that, you need to spin faster and faster to give
the mistress of weather a little boost in the energy department. In
addition to some upset stomachs, your motion creates a thunder-
storm of sound and light, which gives Storm all the power she
needs to blast Magneto. Some young kids (5 and under) may find
the characters, lights, and sounds a bit too intense.
This ride is closed during some off-peak periods.
Toon Lagoon
More than 150 life-size sculpted cartoon images — characters range
from Betty Boop and Flash Gordon to Bullwinkle and Cathy — let you
know you’ve entered an island dedicated to your favorites from the
Sunday funnies.
 Dudley Do-Right’s Ripsaw Falls: The heroic Dudley stars on this
adrenaline-pumping, splashy flume ride that drops 75 feet at 50
mph. Your mission is to save the fair Nell from Snidely Whiplash.
The boats take you around a 400,000-gallon lagoon and plunge you
15 feet below the water’s surface, but this is mainly hype — the
water is contained on either side of you. That said, you will get
very wet anyway. Though it beats out Splash Mountain (see
Chapter 12) in the adrenaline department, the latter offers better
effects and a nicer atmosphere.
Expectant mothers or people with heart, neck, or back problems
shouldn’t ride this attraction. It has a 44-inch height minimum. Tall
folks should note that the boats on this ride offer legroom on par
with that in an airline’s coach section.
 Me Ship, The Olive: This three-story boat offers dozens of interac-
tive activities. Kids can toot whistles, clang bells, or play the organ.
Sweet Pea’s Playpen is a favorite of younger guests. Kids 6 and
older love Cargo Crane, where they can use water cannons to
drench riders on Popeye & Bluto’s Bilge-Rat Barges (see the fol-
lowing bullet).
 Popeye & Bluto’s Bilge-Rat Barges: Here’s another water special —
a churning, turning, twisting, listing raft ride with the same kind of
vehicle as Kali River Rapids at Disney’s Animal Kingdom (see
Chapter 15), but this one’s a bit faster and bouncier (though not
nearly as scenic). You’ll get wet from mechanical devices and from
the water cannons fired by guests at Me Ship, The Olive (see the
preceding bullet). The 12-passenger rafts bump and dip their way
along a course lined with villains, including Bluto and Sea Hag.
Part V: Exploring the Rest of Orlando 
288

“That water is freezing, but it really feels good when it’s hot, and I
loved bouncing up and down on the waves.” Nic’s right; the water
is c-c-cold, which is a blessing on hot summer days but less so in
January, and trust me — you can get completely soaked. Riders
must be at least 42 inches tall to ride.
 King’s Row & Comic Strip Lane: Here you’ll find Beetle Bailey,
Dudley, and plenty of other classic comic characters out and about.
Jurassic Park
All the basics from Steven Spielberg’s wildly successful films (you’ll hear
the score from the movies pretty much everywhere you go), and some 
of the high-tech wizardry, are incorporated into this lushly landscaped
locale, which includes a replica of the visitor’s center from the movie
and one of the best themed attractions in the park.
 Camp Jurassic: This amazingly entertaining prehistoric play area,
designed along the same lines as the Boneyard in Disney’s Animal
Kingdom (see Chapter 15), has everything from lava pits with
dinosaur bones to amber mines to a tropical rain forest where the
bushes occasionally rustle and you can hear dinosaurs off in the
distance. Watch out for the spitters that often lurk in the dark
caves. The multilevel area offers plenty of places for kids to climb,
crawl, explore, and wear down their batteries (eventually).
Although there’s only one way in and out of this attraction, keep a
close eye on young children because it’s easy to get lost inside the
caverns.
 Jurassic Park Discovery Center: Inside this air-conditioned spot,
you can relax for a moment while you and your kids discover some-
thing new. The center has life-size dinosaur replicas, including a
massive skeleton, a handful of interactive games, including a
sequencer that lets you combine your DNA with a dinosaur’s, and
the Beasaur exhibit, where you can see and hear as the dinosaurs
did. You can also play the game show You Bet Jurassic (bet you
wouldn’t see an attraction name like this at Disney), watch a tiny
Velociraptor “hatch” in the lab, and turn your voice into a dinosaur
screech.
Austin (11), Nicolas (9), and Hailey (7) all give this one high marks,
but because there are a limited number of interactive stations, this
attraction can consume a lot of time on busy days.
 Jurassic Park River Adventure: Your adventure cruise begins slowly
but soon throws you into a world of jungle plants and stormy skies,
where you literally come face-to-face with five-story “breathing”
inhabitants of Jurassic Park. At one point, a Tyrannosaurus rex
decides you look like a tasty morsel; at another, spitters launch
venom your way. To escape, you take a breathtaking 85-foot plunge
in a flume that’s steep and quick enough to lift your fanny from the
seat. (When Spielberg rode it, he made them stop the ride and let
Chapter 19: Islands of Adventure 289

him out before the plunge.) Oh, yeah — you’ll get soaked. If you can
only stomach the thought of getting on one flume ride at Islands,
make it this one — both the atmosphere and comfort level far
exceed that of Dudley Do-Right’s Ripsaw Falls.
“That was amazing — the dinosaurs looked real and the waterfall at
the end was fun!” Austin (age 11) could have gone back for more,
though people with height issues may not be as happy.
Ryan (age 13) on the other hand said “the drop at the end was 
definitely too long and way, way too steep.” Riders must be at least
42 inches tall.
 Pteranodon Flyers: The line for this one is simply ridiculous! For
an 80-second ride, neat as it may be, you’ll often wait up to an hour,
sometimes more. This high-flying ride swings from side to side and,
unlike traditional gondolas in sky rides, on Pteranodon Flyers, your
feet dangle free from a two-seat skeletal flyer with little more than a
restraining belt between you and the ground. Now that I’ve scared
you, this is a kiddie ride — single passengers must be between 36
and 56 inches; adults can ride only when accompanying someone
that size. For what it’s worth, I wouldn’t put my young squirmers
on it even if the wait wasn’t so long.
The Lost Continent
Universal has created a foreboding mood in this section of the park, 
the entrance of which is marked by menacing stone griffins and fire-lit
torches. This uniquely themed area combines various mythical and mys-
tical elements, including ancient Greek gods, crumbling ruins, medieval
magicians, and a magical forest.
 Dueling Dragons: This ride has a scream factor of 11 on a 10-point
scale. True coaster crazies love this intertwined set of leg-dangling
racers that climb to 125 feet, invert five times, and, on three occa-
sions, come within only 12 inches of each other as the two dragons
battle it out; you prove your bravery by tagging along. The Fire
Dragon can reach speeds of up to 60 mph, while the Ice Dragon
makes it to only 55 mph. It, of course, comes with the usual health
warnings. You shouldn’t ride this ride if you’re an expectant mother
or if you have heart, neck, or back problems. (Why aren’t you 
surprised?)
For the best ride, try to get one of the two outside seats in each
row. Also, pay attention because the lines for both coasters split
near the loading dock so that daredevils can claim the very first
row, which many hard-core thrill junkies claim offers the city’s ulti-
mate adrenaline rush. And, yes, that line is even longer!
“That was so scary — but so, so cool.” Austin (age 11) barely took
time to give his review as he headed back for another battle. After
riding it several times, he added, “The best seat is the front seat on
Ice.” The other coaster crazy (an adult) found this one a bit too
Part V: Exploring the Rest of Orlando 
290

sharp and abrupt, though still worthy of a thumbs-up rating. Riders
must be at least 54 inches tall.
 The Eighth Voyage of Sindbad: The mythical sailor Sindbad is 
the star of a stunt demonstration with 6 water explosions and 50
pyrotechnic effects, including a 10-foot circle of flames. It doesn’t,
however, come close to the quality of the Indiana Jones Epic Stunt
Spectacular! at Disney–MGM Studios (see Chapter 14), and some
of the characters are far scarier for young kids.
 The Flying Unicorn: This small roller coaster is similar to Woody
Woodpecker’s Nuthouse Coaster at Universal Studios Florida (see
Chapter 18) and the Barnstormer at Goofy’s Wiseacre Farm in
Magic Kingdom (see Chapter 12). That means a fast, corkscrew run
sure to earn squeals, but probably not at the risk of someone losing
his or her lunch. The ride travels through a mythical forest next to
Dueling Dragons. Younger kids love it, but riders must be at least
36 inches tall. I’d have them watch for a few minutes before they
commit to getting on.
 The Mystic Fountain: This interactive smart fountain delights
younger guests. It can see, hear, and spit water, leading to plenty of
kibitzing with those who stand before the stone fountain, suitably
named Rocky. (A staff member viewing the action through cameras
is at the helm, which makes for a personable experience.) It’s a real
treat for 3- to 8-year-olds.
 Poseidon’s Fury: Clearly, Poseidon’s Fury is the park’s best show,
but that may be a backhanded compliment because it’s one of the
park’s only shows. It exposes you to fire and water in the same
manner that Earthquake — The Big One does at Universal Studios
Florida. You pass through a 42-foot vortex — where 17,500 gallons
of water swirl around you, barrel-style — and then get a front-row
seat at a battle royale, where Zeus and Poseidon hurl 25-foot fire-
balls at each other. However, some of the special effects are not up
to the usual Universal standards. If the line is short, I recommend
that you check it out, but if the lines are long, as is often the case,
it’s not worth waiting for.
Children younger than 7 may find the flaming fireballs, explosive
sounds, and rushing water a little too intense. Also, if you wear eye-
glasses, take them off before you walk through the water vortex or
they’ll fog up completely and you won’t see much of anything.
Dining at Islands of Adventure
After riding rides and visiting attractions, you’re probably hungry. You
can get a quick bite to eat at a number of stands in the park, as well as a
handful of full-service restaurants — any and all of which are well above
the standards at most other theme-park eateries. The park’s creators
have taken some extra care to tie in restaurant offerings with the theme
Chapter 19: Islands of Adventure 291

of the island they’re in. For example, the Green Eggs and Ham Cafe in
Seuss Landing may be one of the few places on Earth where you’re will-
ing to eat tinted huevos. (They’re sold in the form of an egg-and-ham
sandwich for about $6.)
 Best Sit-Down Restaurant: At Mythos Restaurant in the Lost
Continent, diners are transported to a mythical underwater world.
This upscale restaurant offers selections ranging from wood-fired
oven pizzas, burgers, and simple bowls of greens, to elaborate
entrees of fish, seafood, and steaks. You can dine here without a
park ticket, but there’s a time limit and you need to leave a credit-
card number at the gate. If you’re running late, the restaurant can
call the gate to let them know so you won’t be charged. This restau-
rant is best suited for adults, although older kids may be okay.
Entrees range from $11 to $20. Open daily from 11:30 a.m. to park
closing.
 Best Atmosphere for Adults: In the Lost Continent, the Enchanted
Oak Tavern and the Alchemy Bar look like a mammoth tree from
the outside; the interior is brightened by a blue skylight with a
celestial theme. The tables and chairs are thick planks, and the
servers are clad like wenches. Try the chicken/rib combo with
waffle fries for $11. You can also choose from 45 brands of beer.
 Best Atmosphere for Kids: The fun never stops under the big top
at Circus McGurkus Cafe Stoo-pendous in Seuss Landing, where
animated trapeze artists swing from the ceiling. Kids’ meals, includ-
ing a souvenir cup, are $6 to $7. The adult menu features fried
chicken, lasagna, spaghetti, and pizza. Try the fried chicken platter
for $8 or the lasagna for $7.
 Best Diversity: Comic Strip Cafe, in Toon Lagoon, is a four-in-one,
counter-service–style eatery offering burgers, Chinese food, Mexican
food, and pizza and pasta ($7–$9).
You can also find several restaurants (see Chapter 10) and clubs (see
Chapter 25) just a short walk from Islands of Adventure at the CityWalk
entertainment complex. If you get your hand stamped, you can leave the
park and return after eating.
Shopping at Islands of Adventure
The park’s 20-something shops have plenty of theme merchandise. You
may want to check out Cats, Hats & Things and All the Books You Can
Read for special Seussian material. Jurassic Outfitters offers an array of
stuffed and plastic dinos, plus safari-style clothing. If you’re a superhero
fan, check out the Marvel Alterniverse Store.
Remember that you may find theme- or character-specific merchandise
in only one store. Here’s a sample of some of the more unusual wares
available:
Part V: Exploring the Rest of Orlando 
292

 Betty Boop Store: You name it; this store in Toon Lagoon has her
famous mug on it.
 Spider-Man Shop: This shop specializes in its namesake’s para-
phernalia, including red Spidey caps covered with black webs and
denim jackets with logos.
 Toon Extra: Where else can you buy a miniature stuffed Mr. Peanut
beanbag chair, an Olive Oyl and Popeye frame, or a stuffed Beetle
Bailey?
 Historic Families — Heraldry: Here’s your chance to get your own
coat of arms made in a shop that looks just like King Arthur’s
armory. It’s a must for the knight wannabe.

A
lthough I’ve always included SeaWorld on my must-see list of parks,
not everyone gives it the chance it deserves. This modern, marine-
adventure park focuses more on discovery than on thrill rides, but it
offers its share of excitement with Journey to Atlantis, a steep flume-like
ride, and the thundering Kraken, a floorless roller coaster. SeaWorld’s
more than 200 acres of educational fun features stars such as Shamu and
his expanding family of performing killer whales, polar bears Klondike 
and Snow, and a supporting cast of seals, sea lions, manatees, penguins,
dolphins, walruses, and more. You can also feed some nonperforming crit-
ters and feel the crushed-velvet texture of a gentle ray in various pools
throughout the park — something Disney and Universal just don’t offer.
SeaWorld’s sister park, Discovery Cove, opened in summer 2000. It lets
guests swim with a dolphin in an adventure that, at $249 to $279 per
person (plus 6.5 percent sales tax), goes off the price chart; you can 
also just swim with the fishes for a lower, though still stiff, ticket price of
$149 to $179. The payoff is that you only have to share the park with 999
other people, not the tens of thousands you find at the other parks. A
day here offers a tranquil and relaxing experience where you can sit in
the sand or swim with the sea life — a refreshing way to spend the day
in Orlando.
In this chapter, I tell you all you need to know to make the most out of
SeaWorld and Discovery Cove.

Gathering Important SeaWorld Information
Before I start wading through the park’s attractions and shows, here are
some helpful, though possibly mundane, matters that you may find help-
ful to know.
Buying tickets and making reservations
You have a couple different options when buying your tickets at SeaWorld.
A one-day ticket costs $62 for adults, $50 for kids 3 to 9 (plus 6.5 percent
sales tax). Buy your tickets online to avoid long lines and save 10 percent
off the regular admission price. SeaWorld sometimes offers online spe-
cials, such as a second day free.
If you’re planning to see a number of non-Disney parks during your stay,
consider the FlexTicket. This pass enables you to pay one price to visit
any of the participating parks during a 14-day period. A four-park pass to
Universal Studios Florida, Islands of Adventure, Wet ’n Wild, and SeaWorld
is $190 for adults and $156 for children 3 to 9. A five-park pass, which adds
Busch Gardens in Tampa, is $235 for adults and $200 for kids. You can
order the FlexTicket through SeaWorld by calling % 407-351-3600 or
heading to www.seaworld.com.
SeaWorld’s Adventure Express Tour ($89 for adults and $79 for kids 3–9
plus park admission fees) is a six-hour guided excursion that includes
front-of-the-line access to Kraken, Journey to Atlantis, and Wild Arctic;
reserved seating at two animal shows; lunch; and a chance to touch or
feed penguins, dolphins, stingrays, and sea lions. It’s the only way to
dodge park lines. SeaWorld doesn’t have an equivalent to FASTPASS or
Universal Express, although its lines aren’t nearly as long as the ones at
Disney and Universal parks. Advanced reservations are recommended
for this tour and can be made by calling % 800-406-2244.
Additionally, you have three one-hour tour options: Polar Expedition
Tour (touch a penguin), Predators Tour (touch a shark!), and Saving a
Species (see manatees and sea turtles). Each tour costs $16 for adults
and $12 for kids 3 to 9 (plus park admission fees) and you have to sign
up for them at the Information Center just inside the park’s entrance.
Call % 800-406-2244 or 407-351-3600 for information.
To gather park information before you leave home, write to SeaWorld
Guest Services at 7007 SeaWorld Dr., Orlando, FL 32801; call % 407-351-
3600; or visit www.seaworld.com. After you’re inside the park, head for
the Information Center, which is on your left as you enter the park.
If you’re arriving on I-4, just look for the signs pointing the way to the
SeaWorld exit. You also can reach it on International Drive. (It’s located
on the southern third of I-Drive.)
Part V: Exploring the Rest of Orlando 
296

The park usually is open from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., 365 days a year, and later
during summer and holidays.
Locating special services and facilities
In case you forgot to bring essential items, or if you need special assis-
tance while at the park, here’s a list of services and facilities that may
come in handy:
 ATMs: You can find an ATM machine that accepts cards from banks
using the Cirrus, STAR, and PLUS systems at the front of the park,
near Atlantis Bayside Stadium, and across from the Sea Lion &
Otter Stadium near the Friends of the Wild gift shop.
 Baby-changing and nursing stations: Changing tables are in or near
most women’s restrooms and at the men’s restroom at the front
entrance near Shamu’s Emporium. You can buy diapers in machines
located near all changing areas and at Shamu’s Emporium. Likewise,
a special area for nursing mothers is located near the women’s rest-
room at Friends of the Wild gift shop, near the center of the park,
near the restrooms in Shamu’s Happy Harbor, and near the first aid
station behind Stingray Lagoon.
 Cameras and film: You can purchase film and disposable cameras
at stores throughout SeaWorld, although digital supplies are limited.
 First-aid center: Registered nurses staff centers behind Stingray
Lagoon and near Shamu’s Happy Harbor.
 Lockers: You can rent them for $8 a day plus a $2 refundable
deposit at Shamu’s Emporium, just inside the park entrance.
 Lost children: Lost kids are taken to the Information Center, where
a park-wide paging system helps reunite them with their families.
Children younger than 7 should wear name tags inside their clothing.
 Parking: Parking costs $10 for cars, pickups, and vans. The parking
lots aren’t huge, so most people can walk to the park, but trams also
run most times. Remember to note the location of your car, too.
SeaWorld characters, such as Wally Walrus, mark sections, but for-
getting where you parked is still easy after a long day in the park.
 Pet care: Board your pet for the day at the kennel between the
parking lot and main gate. The cost is $6 a day (no overnight stays).
Proof of vaccination is required.
 Strollers: Rent dolphin-shaped strollers at the Information Center
near the entrance. They cost $10 for a single, $17 for a double.
 Wheelchairs: Regular wheelchairs are available at the Information
Center for $8; electric chairs are $32; no deposits are required.
Chapter 20: SeaWorld and Discovery Cove 297

SeaWorld and Busch Gardens in Tampa (see Chapter 23), both owned
by Anheuser-Busch, have a shuttle service that provides $10 round-trip
tickets to get you from Orlando to Tampa and back. The 11⁄2 to 2-hour
one-way shuttle runs daily and has five pickup locations in Orlando,
including one at Universal and one on I-Drive (% 800-221-1339). The
schedule allows for about a seven-hour stay at Busch Gardens. The serv-
ice is free if you have a five-park FlexTicket.
Exploring the Top Attractions at SeaWorld
SeaWorld explores the mysteries of the deep in a theme-park format that
combines wildlife-conservation awareness and education with simple
laid-back fun. Up-close encounters with a montage of marine life are the
major draws here, but you can also find plenty of amusing shows and a
handful of thrill rides added to the mix.
To get a good look at the park’s layout, see the “SeaWorld” map on 
page 295.
Believe
Believe, an all-new killer-whale show (replacing the Shamu Adventure
though still taking place at the Shamu Stadium), made its debut in the
summer of 2006. Spectacular ballet-like choreography, a new three-
story-high set design (featuring a gigantic whale tail, fountains, and
video screens), and an exciting musical score combine to create an
impressive and splashy new show. And don’t worry: Shamu remains in
the starring role.
Adjoining the exhibit is an underwater viewing area that lets you get a
close-up view of the killer whales — you may even get to see a mother
with her big baby.
Blue Horizons
Blue Horizons, one of SeaWorld’s most spectacular shows to date, made
its debut in the summer of 2005 and replaced Key West Dolphin Fest.
This unique show combines the grace and power of SeaWorld’s most
famous inhabitants, the dolphins and false killer whales, with the
pageantry of a Broadway production. The show transports you into the
dreams of an imaginative young girl, whose wish is to fly like the birds
and swim like the dolphins. Bringing the story to life, aerialists twirl high
in the air, while dolphins, whales, and bungee jumpers perform acrobat-
ics in the water. Adding to the drama are brightly-colored birds, which
fly over the audience. The entire show is set to an original score per-
formed by the Seattle Symphony Orchestra. This is by far the most
unique show that SeaWorld has created and one that certainly shouldn’t
be missed.
Part V: Exploring the Rest of Orlando 
298

Clyde and Seamore Take Pirate Island
A lovable and amusing sea-lion-and-otter duet, with a supporting cast 
of walruses and harbor seals, stars in this fish-breathed comedy that
comes with a swashbuckling series of stunts. The show, staged inside
the aptly named Sea Lion & Otter Stadium, is corny, but don’t hold that
against the animal actors who are predictably adorable. The perform-
ance serves as a welcome change from all the high-tech rides and shows
at the other theme parks. Be sure to arrive early enough to catch the
mime as he pokes fun at the guests who arrive a bit late, much to the
amusement of the entire audience.
Clydesdale Hamlet
Twice a day except Fridays, eight of the tremendous Clydesdale horses
are hitched to the big red wagon for a parade through the park, begin-
ning and ending at their stables, where visitors also can watch the
parade tack going on and off. Daily petting sessions are scheduled, and
they’re a great time to get a snapshot of you with one of the horses. In
late winter and spring, you may get to see a mare and foal that aren’t
part of the Clydesdale team.
Journey to Atlantis
Taking a cue from Disney’s Imagineers, SeaWorld created a part-flume,
part-coaster ride that carries the customary surgeon general’s warning
about heart problems, neck or back ailments, pregnancy, dizziness, and
claustrophobia. The story line involves a fisherman, Hermes (the Greek
god), and wicked Sirens in a fierce battle between good and evil, but
what really matters is the drop — a wild, 60-foot plunge, with a bunch of
luge-like twists and turns and a shorter drop thrown in for good meas-
ure. There’s no hidden lesson here, just a splashy thrill when you least
expect it. Oh, and it goes without saying that you will get totally soaked.
Key West at SeaWorld
Although not quite the way Hemingway saw Key West, this 5-acre, tree-
and flower-lined, Caribbean-style village has food, street vendors, and
entertainers. It has three animal habitats: Stingray Lagoon, where you
get a hands-on encounter with harmless southern diamond and cownose
rays, an absolute favorite for younger kids; Dolphin Cove, a habitat for
bottlenose dolphins where you can sometimes feed or pet them as they
pass by; and Turtle Point, home to endangered and threatened species.
Shortly after this area opened, the dolphins often teased visitors by
swimming just out of arm’s reach. But they soon discovered the advan-
tages to human interaction — namely smelt.
Speaking of smelt, it’s real easy to be melted by the dolphins’ begging,
and you can quickly burn $20 buying trays of their favorite snack to feed
to your newfound aquatic friends. I once spent half a park admission
feeding them before coming to my senses, so set a limit to your spending
(and feeding) ahead of time.
Chapter 20: SeaWorld and Discovery Cove 299

Kraken
Launched in summer 2000, this coaster is SeaWorld’s deepest foray into
the world of thrill-ride battles. Kraken is named for a massive, mytholog-
ical, underwater beast that Poseidon kept caged. This 21st-century mon-
ster has floorless and open-sided 32-passenger trains that plant you on a
pedestal high above the track. When the coaster breaks loose, you climb
151 feet, fall 144 feet, hit speeds of 65 mph, go underground three times
(spraying bystanders with water — or worse, if you’re weak of stomach),
experience a moment of weightlessness, and make seven loops over a
4,177-foot course. This ride may be the longest 3 minutes, 39 seconds of
your life; according to a coaster fanatic friend who lives for adrenaline,
this is the best coaster in Central Florida (take that, Disney and
Universal!).
Kraken carries a 54-inch height minimum. This is not a coaster for begin-
ners or youngsters — even if they meet the height requirement.
Manatee Rescue
This exhibit is as close as most people get to endangered West Indian
manatees. There are as few as 3,200 of them currently remaining in the
wild. Underwater viewing stations, innovative cinema techniques, and
interactive displays combine for a tribute to these gentle marine mam-
mals. It’s a nicer and roomier (for the manatees) exhibit than the tight
quarters their cousins have at the Living Seas in Epcot (see Chapter 13).
Kids especially like the more-natural outdoor viewing area near the
entrance to the exhibit.
Marine Mammal Keeper Experience
Expect to invest a sizable chunk of your day and budget in this nine-
hour program (it runs 6:30 a.m.–3:30 p.m., so you’ll also need to be an
early riser). You get to work side by side with a trainer, preparing meals
and feeding the animals, learning basic training techniques, and sharing
lunch. It costs $399 (tax included), which also includes seven days of
consecutive admission to SeaWorld, lunch, a career book, and a T-shirt.
The program is limited to three people per day, so make the required
reservations very early. You must be 13 or older, at least 52 inches tall,
able to climb, and able to lift and carry 15 pounds of vittles. Call % 800-
327-2424 for more information.
Odyssea
Inside the Nautilus Theater, a cast of acrobats, mimes, dancers, musi-
cians, and comics put on a undersea show called Odyssea that, at times,
is artistic and funny (and always entertaining). The sets and costumes
focus on a whimsical underwater world. It’s similar in style to the Cirque
du Soleil production at Downtown Disney (see Chapter 25), but on a
much smaller scale. It’s also a great spot to give your feet a break and to
cool off, making it a good stop in the afternoon.
Part V: Exploring the Rest of Orlando 
300

Penguin Encounter
The Penguin Encounter transports you via a 120-foot-long moving side-
walk through Antarctic Tuxedoville. The stars of the show — four different
species of penguins — are on the other side of a Plexiglas shield. You get a
quick look at them as they preen, socialize, and swim at bullet speed in a
30°F habitat. You can also see puffins and murres (shorebirds) in a similar,
but separate, area.
Though you get a nice view of the penguins (and they’re always a hit
with the kids), the viewing-area surroundings leave a bit to be desired.
Pets Ahoy!
A veritable menagerie of cats, dogs, pot-bellied pigs, skunks, and a horse
are joined by birds and rats (nearly 100 animals in all) to perform comic
relief in a 25-minute show held several times a day inside the SeaWorld
Theater. Almost all the performers were rescued from animal shelters.
Stick around after the show and your kids can have an up-close encounter
with a couple of the featured animal stars.
Shamu’s Happy Harbor
This 3-acre play area has a four-story net tower with a 35-foot crow’s-
nest lookout, water cannons, remote-controlled vehicles, a life-size ship,
and a water maze. It’s one of the most extensive play areas at any park
and a great place for kids to unwind. Recent additions that will assuredly
entertain little ones also include the Shamu Express, a kid-friendly
Chapter 20: SeaWorld and Discovery Cove 301
Eating with the fish
In May 2002, SeaWorld opened a new restaurant program called Dine with Shamu
(% 800-327-2420 or 407-351-3600 for information and reservations). This reservations-
only seafood buffet is served poolside with Shamu as a special guest. While eating,
guests can mingle and question SeaWorld trainers. The menu also includes chicken,
beef, and salads and a children’s buffet offering mac ’n’ cheese, chicken, hot dogs, and
other kiddie favorites. The cost is $37 for adults and $19 for kids 3 to 9, in addition to park
admission. Reserving a spot two to three weeks in advance is usually more than enough
unless you’re coming in one of the crunch periods (summer and holidays).
At Sharks Underwater Grill (% 407-363-2559 for reservations), diners can dig into
Floridian and Caribbean treats while watching denizens swim by in the Shark
Encounter exhibit — almost the entire back wall of the restaurant serves as a gigan-
tic viewing area. Menu prices are $16 to $30 for adults and $6 to $12 for kids 3 to 9
(pasta, hot dogs, chicken breast, steak, and popcorn shrimp), and theme-park admis-
sion is required.

coaster with Shamu seats; Jazzy Jellies, a ride that lifts and spins kids
in jellyfish-like seats; and Swishy Fishies, a Mad Tea Party–style ride,
where kids spin ’round and ’round in buckets that surround a gigantic
sand castle. Because of the size of Shamu’s Happy Harbor, smaller kids
can easily get lost and escape to other areas of the park if you’re not
paying close attention.
Bring extra clothes for the tots (or for yourself) because much of the
Harbor isn’t designed to keep you dry.
Shark Encounter
This attraction was expanded to include 220 species of aquatic preda-
tors. Pools out front have small sharks and rays. (Feeding isn’t allowed.)
Eerie background music sets the mood for viewing big eels, beautiful
lionfish, hauntingly still barracudas, and the fat, bug-eyed pufferfish in
large indoor aquariums.
This attraction isn’t for the claustrophobic: You walk through a Plexiglas
tube beneath hundreds of millions of gallons of water. Small children
may find the swimming sharks a little too much to handle.
Sharks Deep Dive gives guests a chance to have limited, hands-off con-
tact with the 58 sharks, including a nearly 9-foot sand tiger, in the Shark
Encounter area. Two at a time, guests don wetsuits and an underwater
helmet (allowing you to breathe and communicate without the need for
scuba gear) for a close-up encounter inside an actual shark cage that
rides a 125-foot track. Part of the cage is above water, but participants
can dive up to 8 feet underwater for a closer look at the inhabitants. The
cost is $150 and you must be a minimum of 10 years old to participate.
The price includes a souvenir booklet, T-shirt, and snorkel gear, but
does not include the required park admission fee. For reservations call
% 800-406-2424.
Wild Arctic
Wild Arctic combines a high-definition adventure film with flight-simula-
tor technology to envelop guests in the beauty, exhilaration, and danger
of a polar expedition. After a hazardous, simulated helicopter flight over
the frozen north, visitors emerge at a remote research base, home to
star residents and polar bear twins Klondike and Snow, seals, walruses,
and white beluga whales. A separate walk-through line is available for
those who want to skip the bumpy simulator ride.
More SeaWorld fun
Other SeaWorld attractions include Pacific Point Preserve, a 21⁄2-acre
natural setting that duplicates the rocky northern Pacific Coast home of
California sea lions and harbor seals (yes, there are smelt opportunities
here!), and Tropical Rain Forest, a bamboo and banyan-tree habitat
that’s home to cockatoos and other birds.
Part V: Exploring the Rest of Orlando 
302

The Anheuser-Busch Hospitality Center next to the Clydesdale Hamlet
has the Label Stable gift shop and a deli and offers free samples of
Anheuser-Busch beers. At the Budweiser Beer School, guests age 21
and over can learn how Anheuser-Busch brews the world’s top-selling
beer.
SeaWorld’s new 5-acre Waterfront area, which debuted in late spring
2003, added a 5-acre, seaport-themed village to the park’s landscape. 
On High Street, look for a blend of shops and the Seafire Inn restaurant,
where lunch includes a lively and comical musical performance of duel-
ing pianists in Piano Shenanigans. At Harbor Square, the funny Groove
Chefs orchestra has chefs making music with pots and pans. The park
has also added street performers, including a crusty old sea captain,
who tells fish tales and makes music with bottles and brandy glasses.
Other eateries include Voyager’s Wood Fired Pizza and the Spice Mill.
In addition to its regular productions, SeaWorld stages a few seasonal
shows as well, including Mistify a nighttime spectacular that takes place
out on the lagoon and combines stunning fireworks, spouting fountains,
and special lighting effects. During summer months, guests are treated
to the special-effects extravaganza nightly. Those dining at the Spice Mill
restaurant (located along the Waterfront) can turn an ordinary dinner (if
timed right) into dinner and a show.
Dining and Shopping at SeaWorld
For details on SeaWorld’s Makahiki Luau, a full-scale dinner show featur-
ing South Seas food (mahimahi, chicken, and pork) and entertainment,
see Chapter 24. For the lowdown on Sharks Underwater Grill, see the
“Eating with the fish” sidebar, above.
SeaWorld also has several counter-style eateries offering the usual burg-
ers, fajitas, salads, and so on. Most fast-food meals cost about $7 or $8
per person, and this doesn’t include the cost of a drink, which will set
you back another $2.50 or so.
The Waterfront is home to a number of full-service dining options with
decent cuisine, including
 Seafire Inn: Choose from a number of burgers (about $8–$9) stir-
fry, sandwiches, and assorted salads, or try a jumbo baked potato
served with your choice of several toppings for around $7.
 Voyager’s Wood Fired Pizza: The pizza-and-parmesan-fries combo
platter here offers good value at $8, with seafood, pasta, chicken,
sandwiches, and assorted salads and a kids’ menu with a huge
selection to choose from as well.
Chapter 20: SeaWorld and Discovery Cove 303

 The Spice Mill: This eatery specializes in the spices of famous sea-
port cities. Try the jambalaya or the jerk-grilled chicken sandwiches
or an array of other more distinctive offerings. Disappointingly, the
food isn’t nearly as spicy as the restaurant’s name implies. An entree
will set you back about $12.
SeaWorld doesn’t have nearly as many shops as the other major theme
parks, but the stores stock plenty of cuddly sea creatures. For example,
you can buy a stuffed manatee at Manatee Cove. The Friends of the Wild
gift shop near Penguin Encounter is also nice, as is the shop attached to
Wild Arctic. Because of the Anheuser-Busch connection, the gift shop
outside the entrance to the park offers a staggering array of Budweiser-
and Busch-related items. A handful of unique boutiques at the Waterfront
feature items from garden art to unique toys and T-shirts.
Checking Out Discovery Cove
SeaWorld’s second theme park opened in summer 2000. Its $100-million
construction cost may be one-tenth the sticker price of Islands of
Adventure, but Discovery Cove’s admission price is four times higher.
The options: $249 to $279 per person plus 6.5 percent sales tax if you
want to swim with a dolphin (minimum age 6), or $149 to $179 if you c
an simply settle for the fishes. The prices vary seasonally, so double-
check when you make your reservations (which are a requirement to
enter this park).
A perk of the higher price tag is that it includes a seven-day consecutive
pass to either SeaWorld or Busch Gardens (see Chapters 20 and 23).
You can upgrade this feature to a 14-day consecutive pass for both parks
for an additional $30. If you plan on visiting all three parks, that’s actu-
ally a pretty good deal.
Almost everyone who does the Dolphin Swim finds it exciting — just 
the kind of thing that makes for a most memorable vacation. If, however,
your kids are younger than age 6, or you decide to skip the Dolphin
Swim, it’s hard to imagine that you’ll get your $129 worth. The atmos-
phere here isn’t tailored to toddlers and is, instead, meant to be a relax-
ing oasis, quiet and serene. I can’t really recommend this park for
anyone with very young children in tow.
The park has more than two dozen dolphins, and each works from two
to four hours a day. They’re pretty incredible animals, and, although
their size may be a bit intimidating to some, they’re very people-friendly.
Many of them are mature critters that have spent their lives in captivity,
around people. Most of them love getting their bellies, backs, and flukes
rubbed. They also have an impressive bag of tricks. Given the proper
hand signals, they can mimic the sound of a human passing gas, chatter
in dolphin talk, and do seemingly effortless 11⁄2 gainers in 12 feet of water.
They also take guests for piggyback rides.
Part V: Exploring the Rest of Orlando 
304

The Dolphin Swim lasts 90 minutes, about 35 to 40 minutes of which is
actually spent in the lagoon. Trainers use the rest of the time to teach
visitors about these remarkable mammals.
The rest of your day won’t be nearly as exciting, but it is wonderfully
relaxing. Discovery Cove doesn’t deliver thrill rides, water slides, or
acrobatic animal shows; that’s what SeaWorld, Disney, and Universal are
for. This is where you come to get away from all that!
Discovery Cove is an all-inclusive park, so in addition to the dolphin
experience, your fee tosses in
 Elbow room — there’s a limit of 1,000 guests per day. (To give you
an idea of how little that is, the normal daily attendance at Disney’s
Magic Kingdom is 41,000.) This ensures that your experience will
be more relaxing and private, which is essentially what you’re
paying for.
 A continental breakfast including danishes, fruit, muffins, juice, and
coffee, as well as snacks throughout the day at either of the park’s
beach bars. Lunch (entrees include items such as fajitas, salmon,
stir-fry, and pesto chicken) is included as well.
 Supplies and gear including a towel, sunscreen, snorkeling gear,
flotation vest, and souvenir photo, as well as free self-parking.
 Activities that include:
• Swimming near (but on the other side of Plexiglas from) bar-
racudas and black-tip sharks.
• Snorkeling around a huge pool containing a coral reef with
colorful tropical fish and another area with gentle rays.
• Touching and feeding 300 exotic birds in an aviary hidden
under a waterfall.
• Cooling off under foaming waterfalls.
• Soaking up the sun on the beaches.
• Enjoying the soothing waters of the park’s pools and rivers
(freshwater and saltwater).
 Seven days of unlimited admission to SeaWorld or Busch Gardens
in Tampa.
Reservations are required far in advance, but you have at least a chance
of getting in as a walk-up guest, because the park reserves a small number
of tickets daily for folks whose earlier dolphin sessions were canceled due
to bad weather. Your best chance for last-minute tickets comes during any
extended period of good weather.

Discovering Orlando’s 
Other Attractions
In This Chapter
 Exploring Orlando’s best smaller attractions
 Getting wet outside Walt’s World
I
n Chapters 11 through 20, I covered the major theme parks in and
around Orlando. But you’re probably wondering if there’s anything
that’s more relaxed, a little — and I do mean little — cheaper, and still
offers a memorable experience.
The answer is yes.
In this chapter, I explore the city’s best alternatives to the mega-parks.
To further help you out, I divide them into two categories: those in
which you stay dry and those in which you get wet — the latter are very
popular options in the midst of Orlando’s summer heat and humidity
(for more about the weather, see Chapter 3).
Most of the attractions listed in this chapter offer coupons online (differ-
ent from their online-only promotional pricing) that you can print out 
at home and redeem when you purchase your admission tickets (at the
attraction). When you tally up the savings for an average family of four,
even using a $1 or $2 coupon (per ticket) for a handful of attractions, it
can add up to fistful of cash.
Checking Out the City’s Best Attractions
For a list of bargain-basement–priced attractions, even easier on your
wallet than the ones I mention here, see Chapter 26.
Gatorland
North of Kissimmee
It’s hard to miss the gigantic green jaws — a perfect vacation photo-op, 
by the way — marking this park’s entrance. Founded in 1949, with just a

handful of alligators living in huts and pens, Gatorland, still privately
owned and operated, now houses thousands of alligators (including a rare
blue one) and crocodiles on its 110-acre grounds that do dual duty as a
wildlife preserve and theme park. Gatorland has survived the arrival of
Disney, Universal, and SeaWorld in part because of its old-Florida charm
and resistance to becoming overly commercialized (though it hasn’t
escaped entirely). Breeding pens, nurseries, and rearing ponds are scat-
tered throughout the densely landscaped property, which also displays
monkeys, snakes, birds, Florida turtles, and a Galapagos tortoise. Its 2,000-
foot boardwalk winds through a cypress swamp and breeding marsh with
an observation tower for those who prefer an overhead view. The park’s
shows include Gator Wrestlin’, where, at the same time wrestlers are
wrangling the reptilians, they’re educating the audience about their oppo-
nents and how they live; Gator Jumparoo, which features the giant rep-
tiles lunging 4 to 5 feet up out of the water to snatch a dead chicken right
from a trainer’s hand; and Upclose Encounters, which showcases a vari-
ety of the park’s wildlife, including some venomous snakes. There’s an
open-air restaurant where you can try smoked gator ribs and nuggets,
though more-familiar favorites, such as burgers and hot dogs, are avail-
able as well, and a shop where you can buy gator-leather goods and sou-
venirs. (Gatorland also operates a breeding farm for meat and hides.)
Younger guests will appreciate the park’s water play area, petting zoo, and
train ride. The atmosphere here is laid back. It’s always been a huge hit
with my family, and it serves up the best half-day experience in the area.
Gatorland’s new Trainer for a Day program lets up to five guests get up
close and personal with the gators for a day (or part of it, anyway). The
$100, two-hour experience puts you side by side with trainers and includes
a chance to wrangle some alligators (minimum age 12). Advanced reser-
vations are required, and admission to the park is included (also a 20 per-
cent discount off a regular admission ticket is extended to up to six
members of your party). A one-hour Night Shine tour is also available ($19
adults, $17 children) taking you on a tour along the wooden walkways with
only a flashlight and a guide. Advanced reservations are required.
See map p. 309. 14501 S. Orange Blossom Trail/U.S. 441 (between Osceola Parkway
and Hunter’s Creek Boulevard). % 800-393-5297 or 407-855-5496. www.gatorland.
com. Admission: $20 adults, $13 kids 3–12; advance online purchase price $17 adults,
$11 kids 3–12. Parking: Free. Open: Daily 9 a.m.–6 p.m., sometimes later.
Harry P. Leu Gardens
Near Winter Park
This serene, 50-acre botanical garden on the shores of Lake Rowena offers
a delightful break from the theme-park razzle-dazzle. Meandering paths
lead through camphors, oaks, and palms. The camellia collection is one of
the world’s largest, blooming October through March. The formal rose gar-
dens are the largest in Florida and contain 75 varieties. Italian fountains,
statues, and a gazebo enhance the gardens. Other highlights include
orchids, azaleas, desert plants, beds of colorful annuals and perennials, a
butterfly garden, and a 50-foot floral clock.

Businessman Harry P. Leu, who donated his estate to the city in the 1960s,
created the gardens. There are guided tours of his house, built in 1888, on
the hour and half-hour (advance reservations suggested). The interior has
Victorian, Chippendale, and Empire furnishings and fine-art pieces.
See map p. 309. 1920 N. Forest Ave. (between Nebraska Street and Corrine Drive).
% 407-246-2620. www.leugardens.org. Admission: $5 adults, $1 children grades
K–12. Admission is free Mon 9 a.m. to noon. Parking: Free. Open: Daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m.
except Christmas. Leu House is closed July.
The Orange County Regional History Center
Downtown
Located within a beautifully restored and historic courthouse built back in
1927, the history center is filled with a multimedia experience that takes
visitors on a tour of the Florida and Orlando of long ago to the thriving
urban community it is today. The interactive and multisensory experience
makes for a unique walk through history. Among the five stories of exhibits
are a Florida back porch where the sights and sounds of central Florida’s
natural environment surround you; a Paleo and Seminole Indian settle-
ment; pioneer cabins; and Florida Crackers. There is also an old courtroom
where Ted Bundy is said to have scratched his name into the defendants’
table. For those who believe, it is said that ghosts have been known to
roam the hallways, causing supernatural disturbances that have induced
more than a few letters of resignation over the years. Guided tours are
available on Saturdays at 11 a.m. Allow two hours.

Free at the Orlando Public Library. Open: Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–5 p.m., Sun noon to 5 p.m.
Orlando Museum of Art
Downtown
This local heavyweight handles some of the most prestigious traveling
exhibits in the nation. The museum, founded in 1924, hosts special exhibits
throughout the year, but even if you miss one, it’s worth a stop to see its
rotating permanent collection of 19th- and 20th-century American art, pre-
Columbian art dating from 1200 B.C. to A.D. 1500, and African art. Allow two
to three hours.
See map p. 309. 2416 N. Mills Ave. (in Loch Haven Park). % 407-896-4231. www.

Tues–Fri 10 a.m.–4 p.m., Sat–Sun noon to 4 p.m.
Orlando Science Center
Downtown
This modern, four-story center — the largest of its kind in the Southeast —
has ten halls in which visitors can explore everything from the swamps 
of Florida to the arid plains of Mars. One of the big attractions is the

shows, and laser-light presentations. In KidsTown, small fries wander in a
mini version of the world around them. Science City, located nearby, has a
power plant and suspension bridge, and 123 Math Avenue uses puzzles and
other things to make math fun. This is just a small sample of what you can
expect to find. This option is a great change of pace, especially if you’re
traveling with children. Allow three to four hours (more if you have an
inquiring mind).
Strollers are available at no extra charge.

Ripley’s Believe It or Not! Orlando Odditorium
International Drive
Do you crave weird science? If you’re a fan of the truly bizarre, come here
to see lots of oddities. Among the hundreds of exhibits in its 16 galleries:
a shrunken head, a two-headed calf, a 1,069-pound man, a five-legged cow,
a three-quarter-scale model of a 1907 Rolls-Royce made of 1 million match-
sticks, a mosaic of the Mona Lisa created from toast, torture devices from
the Spanish Inquisition, and a Tibetan flute made of human bones — you’re
getting the idea right? You’ll also find exhibits on Houdini, films of people
Chapter 21: Discovering Orlando’s Other Attractions 311
Go Orlando!
The Go Orlando Card is a great way to see the “best of the rest” that Orlando has to
offer, with admission to attractions like Gatorland, Ripley’s, Fun Spot Action Park, the
Orlando Science Center, WonderWorks, Kennedy Space Center, Cypress Gardens
(and numerous others), along with discounts at area restaurants and shops. Here’s
how it works: You purchase the all-inclusive Go Card instead of individual tickets to
each venue. You then have two weeks in which to use the card at any of the partici-
pating venues. They are available in two-, three-, five-, or seven-day increments; the
card is activated with the first use and is good for up to 14 days after activated (for
example, a two-day ticket can be used any two days during the two-week time frame).
Depending on the number of attractions you plan to visit, the Go Card may very well
save you some bucks. For details go to www.goorlandocard.com. When you pur-
chase a Go Orlando Card, you’ll receive maps and a free guidebook with information
on the included attractions. The cost of a one-day card is $59 for adults, $49 for kids
ages 3 to 12; a two-day card is $99 for adults, $79 for kids; a three-day card costs $169
for adults, $129 for kids; a five-day card is $219 for adults, $169 for kids; and a seven-
day card runs $279 for adults, $199 for kids.

swallowing coat hangers, and other human oddities. Visitors are greeted
by a hologram of Robert Ripley himself. There are 27 Odditoriums through-
out the world, and no two are alike. The tour makes for a fun rainy-after-
noon or late-night activity. Allow two hours.
See map p. 309. 8201 International Dr. (11⁄2 blocks south of Sand Lake Road). % 407-
345-4501. www.ripleysorlando.com. Admission: $17 adults, $12 children 4–12.
Parking: Free. Open: Daily 9 a.m.–1 a.m.
WonderWorks
International Drive
On an uncharted island somewhere in the Bermuda Triangle, a tornado
was inadvertently created by scientists experimenting with some seriously
weird science. In the midst of the storm, the gigantic building where they
were working was swept up and carried off, dropping right in the middle
of Orlando — amazingly, the building is fully intact, but it’s now upside
down. This attraction is educational and fun — just don’t come expecting
things to be as glitzy as they are in some of the major parks. Throughout
the three levels, you’ll feel the tremble of an earthquake, experience the
rush of hurricane-force winds, create massive bubbles, lie on a bed of nails,
walk across the bridge of fire — a hair-raising, electrical experience — and
even ride the rails via a simulator on a create-your-own-coaster ride. You’ll
learn dozens of fun and interesting facts. (Where are a cricket’s ears? On
its knees.) And experience plenty of mind-boggling visual effects. More
than 100 exhibits are included, but if you’re not a good shot, steer clear of
the Lazer Tag game: It costs $5 above regular admission and can make for
a frustrating few minutes — and while you’re at it, skip the arcade extras
as well.
The attraction also features a nightly combination of magic and comedy in
the dinner show called the Outta Control Magic Comedy Dinner Show.
The 90-minute show features magic and improvisational comedy, as well
as unlimited pizza, popcorn, soft drinks, and beer. It’s a fun time for the
kids and not too bad for adults either. Call to reserve a spot for the show.
Combination tickets are available for discounted admission to
WonderWorks, Lazer Tag, and the dinner show and are a good buy.
Discount coupons are also available on the attraction’s Web site, so check
it out before you arrive.
See map p. 309. 9067 International Dr. % 407-351-8800. www.wonderworks

bination ticket offering admission to WonderWorks, Lazer Tag, and Outta Control $39
adults, $29 kids 4–12 and seniors 55 and older; Outta Control alone is $22 adults, $15
kids 4–11 and seniors. Parking: $2 an hour next door at the Pointe Orlando parking
garage. Open: Daily 9 a.m. to midnight. Dinner show nightly at 6 and 8 p.m.

Getting Wet at Orlando’s Water Parks
For more aquatic fun, see Chapter 16 for information on Disney World’s
pair of water parks: Typhoon Lagoon and Blizzard Beach.
Wet ’n Wild
International Drive
This 25-acre Universal-owned water park is in the same league as Typhoon
Lagoon and Blizzard Beach with regard to its rides (not, in my opinion,
with regard to atmosphere). In terms of popularity, it ranks third in the
country, right behind the two Disney parks. It has several first-rate water
rides, including the Flyer, a six-story, four-passenger toboggan ride pack-
ing 450 feet of banked curves; the Surge, which offers 580 feet of greased
curves and is billed as the fastest tube ride in the Southeast; the Black
Hole, where two-person rafts shoot through 500 feet of twisting, some-
times dark passages; the Bomb Bay, where the floor drops right out from
under you like a bomb being dropped from high in the sky, plunging down
a 76-foot vertical (almost) slide; and the new Disco H2O, which takes riders
back in time on a four-person raft through an enclosed and rather wild
flume ride. Riders eventually end up floating about in the Aqua Club,
giving a whole new meaning to the phrase Disco Duck. Laser lights and
disco balls flash as you move and groove to the sounds of the ’70s. All mul-
tiperson rides require that kids 36 to 48 inches tall have an adult with them.
You can also ride Blue Niagara with its 300 feet of loops and dips (48-inch
height minimum); Knee Ski, a cable-operated knee-boarding course only
open in warm weather (56-inch height minimum); and Mach 5, which con-
sists of a trio of twisting, turning flumes. The park also has a large kids’
area with miniature versions of some of the grown-up rides. If you enjoy
the water, plan on spending a full day here. You can rent tubes ($4), towels
($2), and lockers ($5); or a combination of all three ($9); each rental
requires a $2 refundable deposit. Life vests are free.
If you’re considering visiting several of the non-Disney theme parks, the
most economical way to see Wet ’n Wild, Universal Studios Florida,
Islands of Adventure, and SeaWorld is with a FlexTicket. It enables you
to pay one price to visit any of them during a 14-day period. The four-park
pass costs $190 for adults and $156 for children 3 to 9. A five-park pass,
which adds Busch Gardens, in Tampa (see Chapter 23), is $235 for adults
and $200 for kids. You can order the FlexTicket through Wet ’n Wild.
See map p. 309. 6200 International Dr. (at Universal Boulevard). % 800-992-9453 or
407-351-9453. www.wetnwild.com. Admission: $35 adults, $29 kids 3–9. Parking:
$6. Open: Hours vary seasonally, but the park is open at least 10 a.m.–5 p.m., some-
times as late as 11 p.m., weather permitting.

Shopping in Orlando
In This Chapter
 Getting acquainted with Orlando’s shopping districts
 Checking out the malls, the outlets, and more
 Exploring the antiques district
I
n this chapter, I provide you with a rundown of some of the better
spots outside the Disney district where you can shop to your heart’s
content, if you have anything left in your bank account after the theme
parks have wangled their share. Because Walt Disney World is so expert
at separating you from your money, you’ll find the lowdown on shopping
(and spending) at Disney in Chapter 17 . . . yes, it actually requires its
very own chapter.
Surveying the Scene
Orlando is a shopper’s paradise, offering everything from antiques to
souvenirs to upscale, one-of-a-kind boutiques. Bargains, however, are
few and far between. If you pride yourself on unearthing a good buy,
you’ll be doing a lot of digging before you find any noteworthy deals.
Orlando hosts an array of indoor multilevel malls, many of them with a
fine collection of upscale department stores and unique specialty stores.
There are also a few factory outlets, but the bargains there are often not
much better than the sale prices offered at many department stores. The
city proper has an antiques district where its lots of fun to window-shop,
but unless you’re a serious collector, the prices tend to be prohibitive.
Most of Central Florida’s tourist areas (Orlando, Kissimmee, and the sur-
rounding territory included) are riddled with T-shirt shacks, jeans joints,
and souvenir stands promising bargains that don’t (or rarely) exist.
The same is true of the theme parks. If you line up at the registers at
Disney, Universal, and the other parks, you pay more than what the mer-
chandise is worth. But if you must have those mouse ears, check out the
Disney shopping options in Chapter 17 with the other major theme
parks’ merchandise mentioned in Chapters 18, 19, and 20.

Orlando Area Shopping
Chapter 22: Shopping in Orlando 315

You can actually get cheaper authentic theme-park merchandise outside
of the parks than you can within them. Both Disney and Universal operate
outlet stores in some of the city’s most popular malls (though selections
are often very limited, so don’t expect to find any unique merchandise).
See “Checking Out the Big Names,” below for more details on these rare
opportunities.
Here are three shopping heads-ups before you get started:
 Sales tax: In Orange County, which includes the International Drive
area and most of the parks, sales tax is 6.5 percent. Kissimmee and
the rest of Osceola County charge 7 percent sales tax.
 Store hours: Most of the stores I mention in this chapter are open
seven days a week, from 9 or 10 a.m. until 9 p.m. (6 p.m. on Sun).
Small stores, including those in the antiques district, usually close
around 5 or 6 p.m. and often aren’t open on Sunday. Be sure to call
before you head out; the hours are subject to change.
 Money: Most stores accept major credit cards, traveler’s checks,
and, of course, cash (U.S. currency only). An ATM may not be
handy in some areas, and none of the stores listed in this chapter
accepts foreign currency or personal checks. So be prepared before
heading out.
All the places listed in this chapter can be found on the “Orlando Area
Shopping” map on page 315.
Finally, know that because Orlando is geared toward travelers, many
retailers offer to ship packages home for a few dollars more. So, if you’re
pondering an extra-large or fragile purchase that you don’t want to drag
home on the plane, train, or car, ask. If a retailer doesn’t offer this service,
check with your hotel. Many either have a business center where you can
mail it yourself, or they can arrange a pickup by United Parcel Service
(UPS), the slow-but-good-old U.S. Postal Service, or another carrier to
keep you from dragging a 6-foot stuffed Pluto into the Friendly Skies.
Exploring Great Shopping Neighborhoods
Orlando doesn’t have a central shopping district or districts. Instead,
most shops are sprinkled throughout and around the tourist hotspots
and in retail areas where locals shop, such as malls and so on. The fol-
lowing is a list of some of the more frequented shopping zones:
 Celebration: Think Pleasantville a la Disney. Created by Disney, the
town of 25,000 is more of a charming diversion than a good place to
power-shop. The downtown area has a dozen or so stores and bou-
tiques, a handful of art galleries, a grocer, and a parfumerie among
others. The storefronts are filled with enticing displays, while
inside they peddle interesting and, often, unique — though highly
Part V: Exploring the Rest of Orlando 
316

priced — merchandise; but, the real attraction is the mid-20th-
century, Main Street atmosphere. Those nostalgic for yesteryear, 
or in search of a quieter, more sophisticated afternoon out on the
town, love it, and . . . look, over there! Is that Ozzie and Harriet?
From WDW, take U.S. 192 east 5 miles, past Interstate 4. The
entrance to Celebration is on the right. Call % 407-566-2200 for
more information.
 Kissimmee: Southeast of the Disney parks, Kissimmee straddles
U.S. 192/Irlo Bronson Memorial Highway — a sometimes tacky, too-
often-under-construction stretch of highway lined with budget
motels, smaller attractions, and a branch of every fast-food restau-
rant in the known universe. Although Kissimmee has recently
begun to evolve and now includes more family-oriented attractions
and better hotels and eateries, the town’s shopping merit remains
negligible unless you’re looking for a cheap T-shirt, or seashells 
not sold by the seashore, or the like. That said, lovers of all things
cowboy might appreciate the area’s Western shops, a sign that the
city is still mindful of its cowboy roots.
 International Drive area: This tourist magnet is east of, and extends
7 to 10 miles north of, the Disney parks between Highway 535 and
the Florida Turnpike. The southern end offers a little elbow room,
the midsection is somewhat upscale, but the northern part is a
tourist strip crowded with small-time attractions (including bungee
jumping for those who have a death wish), fast fooderies, and sou-
venir shacks. Its most redeeming shopping draws: Pointe Orlando
and the Orlando Premium Outlets (see listing under “The Malls,”
below).
Locally, International Drive is better known as I-Drive.
 Downtown Orlando: Orlando’s downtown is actually northeast of
the theme parks along I-4. The biggest draws here are the shops
along Antique Row (see “Antiquing Downtown,” below).
 Winter Park: Just north of Downtown Orlando, Winter Park began
as a haven for the wealthy Yankees escaping the cold Northeast.
Today, Winter Park’s centerpiece is Park Avenue, a collection of
upscale shops, art galleries, and restaurants along a cobblestone,
tree-lined street. Ann Taylor, Talbot’s, Williams-Sonoma, and
Crabtree & Evelyn are among the dozens of specialty shops. No
matter which end of Park Avenue you start at, there are more shops
than most can survive, but you’re bound to find something here
you won’t find anywhere else. For more information on Winter
Park, call % 407-644-8281.
Checking Out the Big Names 
Orlando’s reputation wasn’t built on shopping. In fact, it isn’t even the
number-one shopping area in Florida, falling well short of Miami–Fort
Chapter 22: Shopping in Orlando 317

Lauderdale. But Orlando has attracted some big names, including a very
small Saks, as well as Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, Bloomingdale’s, and
Macy’s. Some of the better specialty stores include Tiffany & Co. and
Charles David, while some of the more unique retailers include Ron Jon’s
Surf Shop and Hilo Hattie. It also has a growing stable of discount centers.
Factory outlets
In the last decade, the tourist areas have bloomed with outlets where
shoppers can find plenty of name brands, but not always big bargains.
Although many of the stores claim savings of 50 to 75 percent, a dis-
count on a heavily marked-up or overpriced item doesn’t always mean
you’re actually getting a deal. And more often than not, only a few items
are as heavily marked down as the outlets maintain. What you will find
(at least in most cases anyway) is a decent selection of designer and
name-brand merchandise at slightly lower prices than you would nor-
mally pay at the malls.
If you’re a smart outlet shopper, you know the suggested retail prices for
items before you hit the stores. Therefore, you’ll know just what is —
and what isn’t — a bargain.
Here’s a list of outlet stores and centers in and around Orlando:
 Prime Outlets Orlando (formerly Belz Factory Outlet World): 
(% 407-352-9600; www.primeoutlets.com) is the granddaddy of
all Orlando outlets. Located at 5401 W. Oak Ridge Rd. (at the north
end of International Drive), it has 170 stores in two huge, enclosed
malls and four annexes. The outlet offers more than a dozen shoe
stores (including Bass, Nike, and Timberland), many housewares
stores (such as Fitz & Floyd, Mikasa, and Oneida), and more than
60 clothing shops (Adidas, Danskin, Geoffrey Beene, Guess Jeans,
Izod, Kasper, Liz Claiborne, London Fog, and Tommy Hilfiger, for
example). You’ll also find records, electronics, sporting goods,
health and beauty aids, jewelry, toys, gifts, accessories, lingerie,
hosiery, and so on.
The two main buildings, Mall 1 and Mall 2, each have discount out-
lets for Disney World merchandise (Character Premier and Character
Warehouse), as well as a store for Universal Orlando. You have to dig
for some of the bargains, but if you don’t mind your item saying 2006
instead of 2007, you can save 50 percent or more on select items.
Expect some major changes over the coming months — a $150-mil-
lion makeover is underway to revamp the entire shopping center’s
layout and appearance. The new center will combine the two exist-
ing malls into a single, open-air shopping center, creating additional
retail space and a far more inviting atmosphere. Three of the cur-
rent strip centers are due to be leveled.
 Lake Buena Vista Factory Stores: The three dozen or so outlets
here include Big Dog, Casuals (Ralph Lauren and Tommy Hilfiger),
Part V: Exploring the Rest of Orlando 
318

Gap, Old Navy, Nike, Eddie Bauer, Carters, Liz Claiborne, Fossil,
OshKosh, and Reebok. There’s also a food court and a salon. Savings
are modest, but the plaza itself is quiet and inviting. You can find
these stores at 15591 S. Apopka–Vineland Rd. (% 407-238-9301;
www.lbvfs.com).
 Orlando Premium Outlets: This is my favorite outlet mall in
Orlando, and it’s also the only truly upscale outlet in the city. The
center’s 110 tenants include Armani, BCBG, Coach, Diesel, Dooney &
Bourke, DKNY, Hugo Boss, Kenneth Cole, Lacoste, Nautica, Nike,
Ralph Lauren, Timberland, and Tommy Hilfiger, among a slew of
others. In contrast to most of the outlet centers in the city, its char-
acter is more of an open-air outdoor mall with a Mediterranean flair.
Some of the best buys here are at Banana Republic and a second
location of Disney’s discount Character Premier store. It’s at 8200
Vineland Ave., just off the southern third of I-Drive, next to Dolly’s
Dixie Stampede (% 407-238-7787; www.premiumoutlets.com).
The Malls
The Orlando area is also home to several traditional shopping malls. As
in malls throughout the country, good buys are often elusive. Arguably, a
mall’s best bargain is the people-watching, which is free. Here’s a list of
Orlando’s malls:
 Altamonte Mall: Built in the early 1970s, this is the area’s second
largest mall, behind the Florida Mall (see below). Altamonte Mall’s
major-league tenants include Macy’s, JCPenney, and Sears, as well
as 175 specialty shops. Major renovations have added a food court;
a new indoor, soft-play area for younger kids; rides for toddlers;
and a new 18-screen AMC movie theater with stadium seating. You
can find it at 451 E. Altamonte Dr. (about 15 miles north of down-
town Orlando). For information call % 407-830-4422 or surf over 
to www.altamontemall.com.
 Festival Bay: One of the newest additions to the shopping scene,
Festival Bay’s tenants include a Ron Jon Surf Shop, Hilo Hattie, Bass
Pro Shops, and several other specialty stores. Restaurants include a
handful of fast-food eateries as well as Murray Bros. Caddy Shack,
Fuddruckers, and Dixie Crossroads, with a Cold Stone Creamery 
to top off your meal. Some of the area’s more unique recreational
venues can be found here as well, including Vans (indoor) Skatepark;
the Putting Edge, a glow-in-the-dark mini golf park; and a 20-screen
Cinemark Theater. The Ron Jon Surf Park, where beginners and
experts alike can ride the waves and hang ten all day long, is sched-
uled to make a splash in late 2006. This one can be found at 5250
International Dr. (the far north end of I-Drive across from Prime
Outlets Orlando). For information call % 407-351-7718 or go to
www.shopfestivalbaymall.com.
Chapter 22: Shopping in Orlando 319

 Florida Mall: Anchors include Nordstrom, Lord & Taylor. Macy’s,
Dillard’s, JCPenney, Sears, and Saks to go along with an Adam’s
Mark hotel and more than 250 specialty stores (Abercrombie &
Fitch, Harry & David, Sharper Image, Benetton, Club Libby Lu, and
Crabtree & Evelyn, to name a few), restaurants (the Salsa Taqueria
and Tequila Bar, California Pizza Kitchen, and Buca Di Beppo are
just three of the choices), and entertainment venues. You can find
the Florida Mall at 8001 S. Orange Blossom Trail (at Sand Lake
Road, 4 miles east of International Drive). For details, call % 407-
851-6255 or check out www.shopsimon.com
 Mall at Millenia: This 1.3-million-square-foot upscale center made
quite a splash when it debuted in October 2002 with anchors that
include Bloomingdale’s, Macy’s, and Neiman Marcus. In addition to
the heavyweight anchors, Millenia offers 200 specialty stores that
include Burberry, Chanel, Crate & Barrel, Godiva, Gucci, Lladro,
Swarovski, and Tiffany & Co. Restaurants include the Cheesecake
Factory, P.F. Chang’s China Bistro, Johnny Rockets, and Panera Bread
among others. The Blue Martini, an upscale bar featuring a tapas
menu and 29 designer martinis, is a good place to celebrity-watch 
or just pretend to be famous. The mall is 5 miles from downtown
Orlando at 4200 Conroy Rd. (at I-4 near Universal Orlando). For
details, call % 407-363-3555 or visit www.mallatmillenia.com.
 Orlando Fashion Square Mall: This city-side mall has marbled
walkways, indoor palm trees, and tenants that include Macy’s,
JCPenney, Sears, 165 specialty shops, and an extensive food court.
The mall is 5 miles from downtown Orlando at 3201 E. Colonial Dr.
(% 407-896-1132).
 Pointe Orlando: Although it’s set up like a mall, this complex’s 
two levels of stores, restaurants, and a 21-screen IMAX theater
aren’t under a roof, making it a mall with an open top. Headliners
among the 60 shops include Bath & Body Works, Foot Locker, and
Victoria’s Secret. Major renovations are underway to recreate the
complex to make it more inviting. Additional shops and new restau-
rants have already begun to pop up while a new streetscape atmos-
phere is being created. Parking is $5 in the attached garage, but
most restaurants, nightclubs, and the movie theater will validate
with a purchase. Pointe Orlando is located at 9101 International Dr
(% 407-248-2838; www.pointeorlandofl.com).
Antiquing Downtown
If you can think of nothing better than a relaxing afternoon of sifting
through yesterday’s treasures, check out Antique Row and Ivanhoe
Row on North Orange Avenue in downtown Orlando.
Flo’s Attic (% 407-895-1800; www.flosattic.com) and A.J. Lillun 
(% 407-895-6111) sell traditional antiques. Fredlund Wildlife Gallery
Part V: Exploring the Rest of Orlando 
320

(% 407-898-4544; www.fredlundwildlife.com) sells pricey, original
works of art, including sculpture. And the Fly Fisherman (% 407-898-
1989; www.flyfishermaninc.com) sells — no surprise here — fly-
fishing gear. You can often watch people taking lessons in the park
across the street.
All the stores I mention in this section are spread over 3 miles along
Orange Avenue. The heaviest concentration is between Princeton Street
and New Hampshire Avenue, although a few are scattered between New
Hampshire and Virginia avenues. The more upscale shops extend a few
blocks beyond Virginia Avenue. To reach the area from the theme parks,
take I-4 east to Princeton Street (Exit 43). Turn right on Orange Avenue.
Parking is limited, so stop wherever you find a space.
As for hours of operation, most of the stores are open from 9 or 10 a.m.
to 5 p.m., Monday through Saturday. (Storeowners usually run the
stores, so hours can vary; call before you head out. A small number of
shops are open Sunday, but it isn’t worth the trip from the resorts.)
If you decide to do your antiquing on a Sunday, you can also shop for
fresh produce, plants, baked goods, and crafts every Sunday beginning
at 9 a.m. at downtown’s Sunday Eola Market. It’s located at the intersec-
tion of North Magnolia and East Central. Get more information at www.
downtownorlando.com.
Chapter 22: Shopping in Orlando 321
Homegrown souvenirs
Given Orlando’s history as a major citrus producer, oranges, grapefruit, and other citrus
products rank high on the list of local products. Orange Blossom Indian River Citrus,
5151 S. Orange Blossom Trail, Orlando (% 800-624-8835 or 407-855-2837; www.
orange-blossom.com), is one of the top sellers during the late-fall-to-late-spring
season. It also makes a great place to shop for anyone left in charge of your pets,
house, or other such duties while you’re off vacationing in the Sunshine State.
And if you have a love affair with leather, alligator-skin leather goods are a specialty
of the gift shop at Gatorland, 14501 S. Orange Blossom Trail (% 407-855-5496;
www.gatorland.com). For more details on this classic Florida theme park, see
Chapter 21.

Chapter 23
Going Beyond Orlando: 
Two Day Trips
In This Chapter
 Going on safari at Busch Gardens
 Lifting off at the Kennedy Space Center
E
ven with all that Orlando has to offer (and if you’ve read Chapters
12–20, you know there’s plenty), you may want to drive to the coast
for a day to enjoy a change of pace, some sugary sand beaches, and
warm waters. In addition to Florida’s spectacular beaches, two places
are worth going out of your way to visit: Busch Gardens in Tampa Bay
and the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral. The first is a combi-
nation of SeaWorld, with its lush landscaping, relaxing atmosphere, and
eco-educational themes (see Chapter 20), Disney’s Animal Kingdom,
with its array of African wildlife (see Chapter 15), and Universal’s Islands
of Adventure’s heart-pounding thrill rides (see Chapter 19). Kennedy
Space Center is a unique experience that you just can’t get in Orlando
(unless Disney starts developing a space-shuttle program, which would
be a stretch, even for them).
Trekking to Busch Gardens
When this Tampa theme park grew out of a brewery in the ’60s, the main
(and only) attractions were a bird show and free beer. (Some of you may
be wondering, who could ask for anything more?) Both are alive and
well, but Busch Gardens has grown into one of Florida’s top theme
parks, filled with coasters that can out-thrill even Universal Orlando, as
well as wildlife, eco-educational themes, and landscaping that all give
the park a unique and fascinating allure.
Getting there
If you’re driving from Orlando, head west on I-4 to I-75. Go north on I-75
to Exit 265 (Fowler Avenue/University of South Florida). Bear left on the
exit ramp, and it will lead you directly onto Fowler Avenue. Proceed west
on Fowler Avenue to McKinley Avenue. (McKinley Avenue is the first

light past the main entrance to the university.) Turn left on McKinley.
Proceed south on McKinley to the parking lot and the main entrance to
the park. Parking costs $7 per day. The drive should take a little more
than an hour, depending on traffic.
SeaWorld (see Chapter 20) and Busch Gardens in Tampa, both owned by
Anheuser-Busch, have a shuttle service (% 800-221-1339) that offers
$10 round-trip tickets to get you from Orlando to Tampa and back. The
11⁄2- to 2-hour one-way shuttle runs daily and has five pickup locations in
Orlando, including at Universal Orlando and on I-Drive (call for sched-
ules, reservations, and pickup locations). The schedule allows about
seven hours at Busch Gardens. The service is free if you have a five-park
FlexTicket. For more on the FlexTicket, see “Admission options,” below.
Most Orlando shuttle services will also take you to Busch Gardens. See
Chapter 8 for details on the city’s shuttle companies.
Visitor information
You can get information in advance of your visit by calling % 888-800-
5447 or 813-987-5283 or heading online to the park’s excellent Web site
(www.buschgardens.com). After you’re inside the park, you can obtain
information from several visitor centers, or you can try the Expedition
Africa Gift Shop. Be sure to grab a guide map of the park when you enter.
Busch Gardens is open daily, generally from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. (though
hours can range from 9 a.m.–9 p.m. during peak season). The park’s
hours change seasonally, and seemingly on a whim, so be sure to con-
firm the hours for the day you’re going by either calling or checking the
Web site before you depart.
You can get information, save a few dollars, and avoid waiting in long
lines by buying your tickets to Busch Gardens at the privately owned
Tampa Bay Visitor Information Center, opposite the park at 3601 E.
Busch Blvd., at North Ednam Place (% 813-985-3601; www.hometown.
aol.com\tpabayinfoctr). Owner Jim Boggs worked for the park for 13
years and gives expert advice on how to get the most out of your visit.
Admission options
Busch Gardens has a number of admission schemes, though your options
are usually limited to two as a day visitor:
 One-day regular park admission costs $56 for adults, $46 for kids 3
to 9; children younger than 3 are admitted free. Prices do not include
the 7 percent sales tax.
 The FlexTicket is a multiday, multipark option that may work for
you if you plan on visiting Universal Orlando or SeaWorld while in
Orlando. The most economical way to see the various “other-than-
Disney” parks, you pay one price to visit any of the participating
parks during a 14-day period. A five-park pass to Universal Studios
Chapter 23: Going Beyond Orlando: Two Day Trips 323

Florida, Islands of Adventure, Wet ’n Wild, SeaWorld, and Busch
Gardens is $235 for adults and $200 for kids. You can order the
FlexTicket by calling % 888-800-5447 or by going to www.busch
gardens.com. For more on the other FlexTicket parks, see
Chapters 18 through 21.
Busch Gardens occasionally runs other discount admissions specials and
offers a host of other multiday and annual-pass selections (fun cards and
the like). If you plan on spending more time in Tampa and want some
more details on these options, call % 888-800-5447 or 813-987-5283 or
check the Web at www.buschgardens.com.
Seeing the park
Busch Gardens is older than Walt Disney World and, over the years, has
managed to age quite well. This park has eight distinctive areas, each of
which has its own theme, animals, live entertainment, thrill rides, kiddie
attractions, dining, and shopping. A Skyride cable car soars over the
park, offering a bird’s-eye view of it all. Two things set Busch Gardens
apart from its nearest rival (Disney’s Animal Kingdom): its vast array of
thrill rides (some of best in the country) and the accessibility of its
wildlife.
Chasing thrills
Busch Gardens has six — count ’em, six! — roller coasters (and that
doesn’t include the flume and rapids rides) to keep your adrenaline
pumping and stomach jumping. New to the collection is SheiKra, and
she’s a doozie. The first of its kind in the Americas (and only the third in
the world of its kind, though, of course, this one’s higher and faster),
this dive coaster hurtles you 90 degrees straight down at speeds reach-
ing 70 mph and 4 Gs. If you manage to survive that, its on to a rolling
loop, and a second 90-degree drop, plummeting you 138 feet through an
underground tunnel. Other unexpected thrills await you throughout the
three-minute adventure. As you may expect, there is a height restriction
of 54 inches to ride this one.
Gwazi is a wooden wonder named for a fabled African lion with a tiger’s
head. This $10-million ride slowly climbs to 90 feet, before turning, twist-
ing, diving, and va-rrroommming to speeds of 50 mph — enough to give
you air time (also known as weightlessness). Fact is, these twin coasters,
the Lion and the Tiger, provide 2 minutes and 20 seconds of thrills and
chills, steep-banked curves, and bobsled maneuvers. At six points on
the ride, you’re certain you’re going to slam the other coaster as you hit
3.5 Gs.
There’s a 48-inch minimum height, and the 15-inch seat is smaller than an
airline seat, so it’s a tight squeeze for thin folks and the next best thing
to misery for larger models.
Part V: Exploring the Rest of Orlando 
324

Busch’s other four roller coasters are made of steel. Kumba is a 143-foot-
high number that covers 4,000 feet of track at 60 mph. It jerks you with
sudden turns and has a 54-inch height minimum. Montu musses your
hair at speeds exceeding 60 mph while the G-force keeps you plastered
to your seat (another 54-inch minimum). Python is a tad tamer, running
through a double-spiraling corkscrew and a 70-foot plunge (48-inch mini-
mum). Scorpion offers a high-speed 60-foot drop and 360-degree loop
(42-inch minimum).
The park’s water rides are welcome relief from the summer heat.
Tanganyika Tidal Wave (48-inch height minimum) is a steep flume, 
while Congo River Rapids (42-inch height minimum) is similar to Kali
River Rapids in Animal Kingdom (see Chapter 15).
Meeting animals and seeing shows
Busch Gardens has several thousand animals living in very naturalistic
environments that continue the park’s African theme. Most authentic is
the 80-acre Serengeti Plain, strongly reminiscent of the real Serengeti of
Tanzania and Kenya, upon which zebras, giraffes, and other animals
graze. Unlike the animals on the real Serengeti, however, the grazing ani-
mals have nothing to fear from lions, hyenas, crocodiles, and other pred-
ators, which are confined to enclosures — as are hippos and elephants.
Busch’s critters have fewer places to hide and, therefore, are much
easier to see than those at Animal Kingdom (see Chapter 15).
Twenty-six acres of the Serengeti Plain are devoted to free-roaming white
rhinos. Rhino Rally, a Land Rover tour through the plains, takes up to 
16 passengers on a very bumpy, seven-minute journey where the white
rhinos, Asian elephants, cape buffaloes, alligators, antelopes, and other
animals roam. There are, of course, a few catches along the way to make
the ride a bit more exciting. If you can handle the bumps, it’s a pretty
good ride, and one of the few that’s appropriate for almost all ages.
Nairobi’s Myombe Reserve is home to gorillas; this area also has a baby-
animal nursery, petting zoo, turtle and reptile displays, and an elephant
exhibit. Congo features rare white Bengal tigers.
In addition to the animals, your kids will love Land of Dragons, which
has slides, a tree house, and rides. Kids also like the sandy dig site at
King Tut’s Tomb and the friendly lorikeets of Lory Landing. Pirates 4-D,
a 15-minute flick that replaced R.L. Stine’s Haunted Lighthouse, is another
family-friendly favorite. The high-seas comedic adventure combines sen-
sory effects and 3-D film to entertain your pint-size pirates.
And did I mention the free beer if you’re 21 or older? This is an Anheuser-
Busch park you know. You can sample their products at the Hospitality
House.
Chapter 23: Going Beyond Orlando: Two Day Trips 325

Special tours and options
Although you get close to Busch Garden’s predators, hippos, and ele-
phants in their glass-walled enclosures with a regular admission, the
only way to mingle with the grazers is on a tour. Here are the best the
park offers (note that children must be at least 5 years old to participate
in any of them):
 For an extra $34 over the admission price, you can go on the 30-
minute, guided Serengeti Safari tour, which feature an extra-close
look and a chance to feed giraffes, gazelles, and more (from the
back of a flatbed truck). If you’re eager for a hands-on wildlife expe-
rience, the safari is worth the extra money. You can make reserva-
tions for the first tour of the day at the Expedition Africa Gift Shop
or by calling % 813-984-4043, but the midday and afternoon tours
are first-come, first-served. Kids must be older than 5 years old to
participate.
 The five-hour Guided Adventure Tour gives you the safari, front-of-
the-line access to shows and rides, plus lunch, for $85 to $95 above
park admission. The Elite Adventure Tour includes the above plus
free parking (normally $9), free bottled water on the tour, merchan-
dise discounts, VIP seating at shows, and lunch ($199 per person
plus park admission). If you want to participate, reserve in advance
by calling % 813-984-4043 or going to www.buschgardens.com.
Blasting Off to John F. Kennedy Space Center
Each time a space shuttle blasts into the heavens, someone you know
wishes he or she could be an astronaut. Heck — maybe it’s you. You can
live out your childhood fantasies at the Kennedy Space Center located
on the so-called “Space Coast” at Cape Canaveral.
Getting there
Though there are shuttles from Orlando to Cape Canaveral, this area
really demands a car in order to be seen properly. The Center is an easy
hour’s drive from Orlando via the Beeline Expressway (Highway 528, a
toll road). Take the S.R. 407 exit going to Kennedy Space Center (KSC)
and Titusville, and continue on S.R. 407 until it dead ends into S.R. 405.
Turn right (east) onto S.R. 405 and follow the signs for Kennedy Space
Center. You’ll travel approximately 9 miles on S.R. 405. The KSC Visitor
Complex will be on your right. Parking is free.
Visitor information
For information before you leave home, call % 321-449-4444 or check
out the Center’s Web site at www.kennedyspacecenter.com. For general
information about the Space Coast, contact the Florida Space Coast

Office of Tourism/Brevard County Tourist Development Council by
calling % 800-872-1969 or 321-868-1126, or by surfing the Web to www.
space-coast.com.
The Visitor Complex is open from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. and the Astronaut
Hall of Fame is open from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. daily (except Christmas and
select launch days). Always call to confirm these hours before you set
out for Cape Canaveral.
Admission options
You have two main ticket options:
 Standard Admission includes admission to the Kennedy Space
Center, several IMAX films, and access to exhibits and shows. It
costs $31 for adults and $21 for kids 3 to 11.
 A Maximum Access Admission pass includes admission to the
Kennedy Space Center, several IMAX films, access to exhibits and
shows, entrance to the Astronaut Hall of Fame, and a chance to ride
in an interactive space simulator. It costs $38 for adults and $28 for
kids 3 to 11. You can purchase this pass (and others) online at www.
kennedyspacecenter.com.
You can also purchase Hall of Fame admission only for $17 adult, $13
children. A 12-month pass runs $50 adult, $35 children. The ATX, or
Astronaut Training Experience (see “Special tours and options,” below),
costs $225.
Touring the Center
Whether you’re a space buff or not, you’ll appreciate the sheer grandeur
of the facilities and technological achievements displayed at NASA’s pri-
mary space-launch facility. Highlights of the Center include trips down
memory lane and glances into the future of space exploration. You also
explore the history of manned flights, beginning with the wild ride of the
late Alan Shepard (1961) and Neil Armstrong’s 1969 moonwalk. The
Center also has dual 51⁄2-story, 3-D IMAX theaters that reverberate with
special effects. You’ll need at least a full day to see and do everything
here.
Begin your visit at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex, which
has real NASA rockets and the actual Mercury Mission Control Room
from the 1960s. You’ll find several hands-on activities for kids, including
a chance to meet a real astronaut, as well as several dining venues and a
shop selling a variety of space memorabilia and souvenirs. Because this
privately operated complex has been undergoing an ambitious $130-
million renovation and expansion, check to see whether it has changed
its tours and exhibits before visiting.
Chapter 23: Going Beyond Orlando: Two Day Trips 327

Bus tours of the complex (included with your admission) run continu-
ously every 15 minutes beginning at 10 a.m. Plan to take the tour early in
your visit and be sure to hit the restrooms before boarding the bus —
there’s only one out on the tour. You can get off at the LC-39 Observation
Gantry, which has a 360-degree view of shuttle launch pads; the
International Space Station Center, where scientists and engineers pre-
pare additions to the space station now in orbit; and the Apollo/Saturn V
Center, which includes artifacts, photos, interactive exhibits, and the
363-foot-tall Saturn V rocket.
Don’t miss the Astronaut Memorial, a moving black-granite monument
that has the names of the U.S. astronauts who have died on missions or
while in training. The 60-ton structure rotates on a track that follows the
movement of the sun (on clear days, of course), causing the names to
stand out above a brilliant reflection of the sky.
The Astronaut Hall of Fame, a separate attraction at the Kennedy Space
Center Visitor Complex, includes displays, exhibits, and tributes to the
heroes of the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo space programs. There’s also
a collection of spacecraft, including a Mercury 7 capsule, a Gemini train-
ing capsule, and an Apollo 14 command module. And in Simulator
Station, guests can experience the pressure of four times the force of
gravity, ride a rover across Mars, and land a space shuttle.
On launch days, the Center is closed at least part of the day. Although
launch days aren’t good times to see the Center, they’re great occasions
to observe history in the making. Schedules for launch tickets entitling
you to admission to the Center for the shortened operating hours, plus
at least a two-hour excursion to NASA Parkway to see the liftoff, are
available by calling % 321-449-4444. You must pick up tickets, available
five days prior to the launch, on-site.
Special tours and options
The Kennedy Space Center offers a number of special programs and
tours to visitors. Here are a few that will delight any wannabe-astronauts
or avid space buffs:
 The ultrapopular Lunch with an Astronaut program gives visitors
the chance to enjoy an out-of-this-world experience: lunch with an
actual astronaut. The opportunity is available at the Center every
day during lunch hours. Past participants have included John
Glenn, Jim Lovell, and Wally Schirra. Seating is limited, so be sure
to reserve well in advance by calling % 321-449-4400 or heading
online to www.kennedyspacecenter.com. The program costs $23
for adults and $16 for kids 3 to 11 in addition to the cost of admis-
sion to the Center.
 The Cape Canaveral: Then and Now tour includes a visit to the
first launch sites, the Air Force Museum, and the Missile Museum.
The tour costs $22 for adults and $16 for kids 3 to 11.
Part V: Exploring the Rest of Orlando 
328

 On the 90-minute NASA Up Close tour, a space program expert
guides you through the intricacies of the space-shuttle program
and gives you an up-close look at the space-shuttle launch pads.
The tour almost always sells out, so reserve in advance of your trip
by calling % 321-449-4400 or going online to www.kennedyspace
center.com. The tour costs $22 for adults and $16 for kids 3 to 11,
in addition to the cost of admission.
 For future space explorers, the Astronaut Training Experience
(ATX) is a day-long interactive program including an orientation,
mission briefing, and simulator training exercises. The program
ends with a team shuttle mission from launch to landing in a full-
scale Space Shuttle mock-up. A T-shirt, class photo with a real
astronaut, lunch, and a graduation ceremony are all part of the
deal. Advance reservations are required as space is very limited.
Due to the intensity of the experience you must be at least 14 years
old to participate; participants under 18 must be accompanied by a
paying adult. The program costs $225 and includes ATX gear and
lunch.

Nightlife

O
rlando’s action used to literally rise and set with the
sun, but that’s hardly the case now. I tip my hat to you 
if you still have the pizazz for a nighttime adventure after a
day in the parks. Whether you prefer rocking the night away,
slow-dancing until dawn, or dining while you watch pirates
battle for treasure, you can liven up your evenings in Orlando,
and this part of the book shows you how.

Chapter 24
Taking in the Dinner Shows
In This Chapter
 Seeing Orlando’s best dinner shows
 Getting tickets for everything else
I
f a day at the theme parks isn’t enough to satisfy your appetite for
entertainment, Orlando’s dinner theaters serve up a rather diverse
menu of amusements to keep you entertained as you dine. In this chap-
ter, I tell you about dinner shows where you can solve a “murder,” learn
to hula, or cheer on a knight at a medieval joust.
Getting the Inside Scoop on Orlando 
Dinner Theater
Orlando’s busy dinner-show scene is far different from those you find in
high-flying cultural centers such as Paris, New York, and London. Walt
Disney World and Orlando feature family-oriented fun and fanfare rather
than critically acclaimed dramatic performances. Most shows focus on
entertaining the city’s top VIPs: the kids. Expect action, adventure, and
corny humor, all generally performed in a very loud stadium setting
where the kids can scream to their hearts’ content.
Did you ever notice that you never see dinner-shows listed in the restau-
rant section? Ever wonder why? It’s not the dinner you’re going for.
Eating adds its own ingredient of adventure to Orlando’s dinner-theater
experience. The fare is generally right off the rubber-chicken circuit. The
meals usually consist of a choice of two or three generic entrees (often
overcooked) and school-lunch-caliber side dishes. This may very well
explain why some theaters serve free wine and beer after you’re been
seated — to dull your palate before dinner is served.
The prices of the shows that I list in this section include your meal and
the aforementioned wine and beer (soda is available, too) but not tax or
tips, unless otherwise noted.

You can often find discount coupons to the dinner shows inside the
tourist magazines distributed in the tourist information centers, hotel
lobbies, gas stations, and sometimes on the listed Web sites. A good
place to look for discounted tickets for the dinner theaters is the
Orlando CVB Web site (www.orlandoinfo.com).
For all dinner shows, advance reservations are strongly recommended.
And when it comes to Walt Disney World dinner shows, always, always,
always, make an Advanced Dining Reservation (% 407-939-3463). 
(See Chapter 10 for more about Advanced Dining Reservations.) Disney’s
shows fill up fast, often months in advance for weekend performances
and during peak vacation seasons and holidays. I’ve actually spent sev-
eral days trying to make reservations (for the Hoop-Dee-Doo Musical
Review), calling the very minute the phone lines opened (usually
around 7 a.m.) about one year in advance and it took four days to finally
get a reservation — and I didn’t get the day or the time I would have
liked.
Arabian Nights
Kissimmee
If you’re a horse fan, this show is a winner. It stars many of the most popu-
lar breeds, from chiseled Arabians to hard-driving quarter horses to beef-
cake Belgians. They giddy-up through performances that include trick
riding, chariot races, a little slapstick comedy, and bareback daredevils. The
premise of the show is the elaborate wedding of the prince and princess —
what wedding would be complete without an uninvited guest? — and so
begins the adventure. Locals rate it number one among Orlando dinner
shows. On most nights, the performance opens with a ground trainer work-
ing one-on-one with a black stallion. The dinner, served during the two-
hour show, includes salad; a choice of prime rib, grilled chicken, chicken
tenders, chopped steak, or vegetable lasagna; vegetables; garlic mashed
potatoes; rolls; and wedding cake for dessert. Unlimited beer, wine, or soda
pop comes with the meal.
The Web site usually offers a discount on tickets purchased online.

Dolly Parton’s Dixie Stampede
Lake Buena Vista
What do you get when you combine 32 horses, a slew of talented riders
and singers, and Dolly’s family-friendly vision of the Civil War? A down-
home battle of the North and South featuring corny jokes and plenty of
audience interaction. You’ll try to resist, but it’ll win you over. Come early
for entertainment by Gary, the original Electric Cowboy. The all-inclusive

price includes soda, coffee, tea, beer, and wine (a two-drink limit on the
alcoholic beverages), as well as a four-course, Southern-style meal (rotis-
serie chicken and barbecued pork or lasagna, corn on the cob, herb
potato, and a turnover for dessert) — the creamed vegetable soup is sur-
prisingly tasty. Be sure to take a gander at the horse stables after the show.
See map p. 309. 8251 Vineland Ave. (off I-4, next to the Orlando Premium Outlets). 
% 866-443-4943. www.dixiestampede.com. Reservations required. Shows: 
6:30 p.m.; an 8:30 p.m. show is sometimes added. A holiday version of the show runs
during the Christmas holiday season. Admission: $49 adults, $22 kids 4–11. AE, DISC,
MC, V. Stadium-style seating. Parking: Free.
Hoop-Dee-Doo Musical Revue
Walt Disney World
This show at Disney’s Fort Wilderness Resort & Campground (see
Chapter 9 for more on this hotel) is Disney’s most popular, so make
Advanced Dining Reservations as early as possible. The reward: You feast
on a down-home, all-you-can-eat barbecue (fried chicken, smoked ribs,
salad, corn on the cob, baked beans, bread, salad, strawberry shortcake,
and your choice of coffee, tea, beer, wine, sangria, or soda) all served up
family-style in tin buckets. While you stuff yourself silly in Pioneer Hall,
performers in 1890s garb lead you in a foot-stomping, hand-clapping high-
energy show that includes plenty of jokes that you haven’t heard since ele-
mentary school, but somehow seem just as funny now. The audience is
quickly caught up in all the hoopla, and even the most skeptical find them-
selves having plenty of fun. Although the songs and skits are a bit corny,
the talent is absolutely stellar.
If you catch one of the early shows, consider sticking around for the
Electrical Water Pageant at 9:45 p.m., viewed from the Fort Wilderness
Beach.
Audience participation is heavily encouraged, and the cast is more than
happy to help you single out your friends.
Upon arriving at Fort Wilderness, you’ll need to park in the guest lot and
take the resort’s internal bus system to Pioneer Hall where the show is
held. Add at least an extra half-hour to your traveling time because of
this.
Reservations can be made up to 180 days in advance. Your travel dates
will determine how far in advance to call — during holidays, spring break,
and summers you should make reservations as early as possible. You have
to pay the entire bill when making the reservation, but as long as you call
at least 48 hours prior to the day of your reservation, you’ll be refunded
your entire payment if you find that you have to cancel.

Makahiki Luau
SeaWorld
SeaWorld’s entry on the Orlando dinner circuit starts with the arrival of
the tribal chief via boat, with a ceremonial progression leading the audi-
ence into a theater located in the Seafire Inn at the park’s Waterfront dis-
trict (see Chapter 20 for more on the theme park). Throughout the night,
you experience the ancient customs, rhythmic music and dance, authen-
tic costumes, and family-style dining on Polynesian-influenced cuisine that
includes tropical fruit, mahimahi, sweet-and-sour pork, Hawaiian chicken,
island stir-fried vegetables, fried rice, dessert, and beverages, including
one free cocktail. My only complaint is that the ventilation in the theater
wasn’t adequate for all the smoke used during the show. At one point, sit-
ting at one of the front tables, I couldn’t see anything, not even my food.
See map p. 295. 7007 SeaWorld Dr. (inside the Waterfront at SeaWorld). % 800-327-

Shows: 5:30 and 8:15 p.m. Admission: $46 adults, $30 kids 3–9. AE, DISC, MC, V. Table
seating. Parking: Free.
Medieval Times
Kissimmee
Orlando has one of eight Medieval Times shows in the United States and
Canada. Inside, guests gorge themselves on garlic bread, barbecued spare
ribs, herb-roasted chicken, vegetable soup, appetizers, herb-roasted pota-
toes, a pastry dessert, and beverages, including beer. But because this
show is set in the 11th century, you eat with your fingers from metal plates
while knights mounted on Andalusian horses run around the arena, joust-
ing and clanging to please the fair maidens. Arrive 30 minutes early to
allow time to tour the Medieval Village, a re-created Middle Ages settle-
ment. There are plenty of opportunities to part with your cash, including
photos and toys, so set your limits ahead of time, or the evening can wind
up costing a bundle.
See map p. 309. 4510 W. Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy. (U.S. Highway 192, 11 miles east

MurderWatch Mystery Theatre
Lake Buena Vista
Mystery lovers rejoice! The game’s afoot every Saturday night at this all-
you-can-eat buffet, which offers beef, chicken, fish, and a separate chil-
dren’s buffet while diners try to solve a mystery. The proceedings take
place in Baskerville’s restaurant, which has 19th-century Edwardian décor
and houses a Sherlock Holmes museum. This somewhat sophisticated
offering is one of the city’s best.

Pirate’s Dinner Adventure
International Drive Area
The special-effects show at this theater includes a full-size ship in a
300,000-gallon lagoon, circus-style aerial acts, a lot of music, plenty of
swordfights by swashbuckling pirates, and a little drama. Dinner includes
an appetizer buffet with the preshow, followed by roast chicken and beef,
rice, vegetables, dessert, and coffee. After the show, you’re invited to the
Buccaneer Bash dance party where you can mingle with cast members.
This show gets somewhat mixed reviews; the more favorable come from
kids with an affinity for pirates and swordfights (of which there are plenty).
The arena is smaller than some of the others in the area, which makes it a
slightly friendlier experience overall.
See map p. 309. 6400 Carrier Dr. (From Disney, take I-4 to Sand Lake Road, go east to
International Drive, and then north to Carrier.) % 800-866-2469 or 407-248-0590.

Sleuths Mystery Dinner Shows
International Drive Area
Catering more to an adult crowd (though they do offer two special after-
noon versions for kids), the mysteries solved here are absolutely hilari-
ous whodunits. In a smaller, more-intimate theater, guests are seated
around small tables while enjoying the show. After some of the characters
serve hot and cold hors d’oeuvres to guests, the show begins. Dinner is
served between acts and includes a choice of Cornish game hen, herb
stuffing, baked potato, vegetables, and cranberry sauce; prime rib (for an
additional $3) with baked potato and vegetables; or four-cheese lasagna
(with or without meat), vegetables, and garlic bread. You also get dessert
and unlimited beer, wine, and soft drinks. Guests are encouraged to dis-
cuss the clues to solve the murder. The more the audience participates
(which often seems directly related to the amount of alcohol they con-
sume), the more amusing the show can be. Eleven unique mysteries keep
guests coming back for more.
Discounts are often available online, as well as in many of the tourist
publications.
See map p. 309. 8267 International Dr. (Take I-4 East to Exit 75A, and turn right at the
light onto Universal Boulevard. Sleuth’s is 1 mile down on the right in the Goodings

Disney’s Spirit of Aloha Show
Walt Disney World
Although not quite as much in demand as the Hoop-Dee-Doo Musical
Revue, Disney’s Polynesian Resort (see Chapter 9 for more on the hotel)
presents a delightful two-hour show, which comes across like a big neigh-
borhood party with island flair. The luau features Tahitian, Samoan,
Hawaiian, and Polynesian singers, drummers, and dancers who entertain
you while you feast on a menu that includes tropical appetizers, Lanai-
roasted chicken, pork ribs, sliced pineapple, Polynesian wild rice,
Polynesian-style bread, South Seas vegetables, dessert, wine, beer, and
other beverages. Kids can eat mac ’n’ cheese, hot dogs, chicken nuggets,
or PB&J if they prefer. The show takes place five nights a week in an open-
air theater (dress for nighttime weather) with candlelit tables, red-flame
lanterns, and tapa cloth paintings on the walls.
Reservations should be made at least 60 to 90 days in advance (but can
be made up to 180 days in advance), especially during peak periods
such as summer and holidays. Payment must be made in full at the time
of the reservation, but you can cancel up to 48 hours prior to your
scheduled show for a full refund.

Getting Information and Tickets
For evening entertainment other than the dinner shows, dozens of rock,
rap, jazz, pop, country, blues, and folk stars are in town during any given
week in Orlando. You can find schedules in the Orlando Sentinel’s
Calendar section, published every Friday and available online at www.
orlandosentinel.com. The Orlando Weekly’s Calendar section
(www.orlandoweekly.com) is another good source of information for
live-music events, including club schedules.
Ticketmaster is the key reservations player for most major events in
Orlando, including concerts, shows, and pro-sports events. If you know
of an event that’s happening while you’re in town, check first with your
hometown Ticketmaster outlet to see whether it sells tickets for the
event. (If you live as close as Miami or Atlanta, it probably does.)
Otherwise, call the Ticketmaster outlet in Orlando at % 877-803-7073
or 407-839-3900, or go to its Web site at www.ticketmaster.com.
You can also get additional event information and can often order 
tickets from the Orlando/Orange County Convention & Visitors 
Bureau (% 407-363-5872; www.orlandoinfo.com).

Hitting the Clubs and Bars
In This Chapter
 Rockin’ the night away at Walt Disney World
 Cruising the clubs at Universal’s CityWalk
 Exploring hotspots inside Orlando’s hotels
 Finding a few more places to party
A
lthough Orlando has a reputation as a daylight destination, its
nighttime offerings continue to grow as fun-seekers aren’t ready to
call it quits after a day at the parks.
Clubs such as Mannequins Dance Palace and House of Blues at Pleasure
Island and Disney’s West Side rock well into the wee hours. Universal
Orlando’s CityWalk entertainment district features nightspots such as
the groove and CityJazz.
Many of the clubs that I list in this chapter are open to anyone 18 or
older, but remember: The minimum drinking age in Florida is 21, and the
clubs will check your ID.
Enjoying the Pleasures of Pleasure Island
This 6-acre entertainment district is the home of several clubs, bars, and
restaurants. You can enter the complex for free if you just want to take in
the ambience but don’t plan to enter any of the clubs. Admission to a
single club (you can choose from all but the Comedy Warehouse and
Adventurers Club) is $11, including tax. A single-day pass that allows
you to hop from club to club is $21 plus tax. (If you purchase the Water
Park Fun & More Option, you can choose admission to Pleasure
Island’s clubs as part of the package — see Chapter 11 for information
on Disney’s admission passes.) Self-parking is free. For information on
Pleasure Island, call % 407-939-2648 or check out Disney’s Web site at
www.disneyworld.com.
The island is designed to look like an abandoned waterfront industrial
district with clubs in its lofts and warehouses. But the streets are deco-
rated with brightly colored lights and balloons, giving it a carnivalesque
feel. After the clubs open, loud music blasts, a few scantily clad dancers

gyrate on outdoor stages, and alcohol is served on the streets. Every
evening at Pleasure Island ends with a New Year’s Eve celebration at
midnight — noisemakers, confetti, lights, countdown, the works. I
wouldn’t suggest bringing along the kids too late into the evening, as
much of the partying is right in the streets — with crowds wandering
(sometimes not so steadily) about.
Mannequins Dance Palace is Pleasure Island’s main event. It’s a high-
energy club with a big, rotating dance floor. Just watching the inebriated
trying to get on and off the spinning surface can be an evening’s worth of
entertainment. Because it’s a local favorite, the club is hard to get into,
so arrive early, especially on weekends. Three levels of bars and mixing
space are adorned with elaborately dressed mannequins. The DJ plays
contemporary tunes loudly enough to wake the dead.
You must be 21 to enter, and the staff is very serious about that.
Adventurers Club is a multistory building that, according to WDW legend,
was designed to be the library and archaeological trophy room for
Pleasure Island founder and explorer, Merriweather Adam Pleasure, who
was lost at sea in 1941. The club is decorated with early aviation photos,
hunting trophies, and a mounted yakoose — a half yak, half moose that
speaks, regardless of whether you’re drinking. Also on hand are Pleasure’s
zany band of globetrotting friends and servants, played by skilled actors
who interact with guests while staying in character. Improvisational
comedy and cabaret shows are performed in the library. You can easily
hang out here all night, sipping potent tropical drinks in the library or the
bar, where elephant-foot barstools rise and sink mysteriously.
If you’re a fan of the BET Cable Network, you’ll probably love BET
Soundstage Club (% 407-934-7666), which offers traditional R&B and
the rhyme of hip-hop, with the occasional Latin-music night thrown in
here and there. You can dance on an expansive floor or kick back on an
outdoor terrace. Cover charge for the Soundstage is included in the
Pleasure Island single-day ticket, except for major concerts.
A very talented troupe — the Who, What and Warehouse Players — 
is the main event at the Comedy Warehouse. The group performs 45-
minute improvisational shows based on audience suggestions. It does
five shows a night. Remember that you’re in Disney, so the comedy here
is pretty much squeaky clean.
Patent leather and polyester rule at 8 Trax, a 1970s-style disco where 50
TV screens air diverse shows and videos over the dance floor. A DJ plays
everything from “YMCA” to “The Hustle.” Some nights he may even dig
into the music of the ’80s for a few dance gems.
If your taste in live music runs more to the Top-40 and rock veins, both
the Rock ’n’ Roll Beach Club and the outdoor West End Stage will sat-
isfy your needs.

Chapter 25: Hitting the Clubs and Bars 341
Pleasure Island’s Motion, tries hard to be hip and trendy but still fea-
tures a mix of Top-40 tunes and alternative rock. It’s a hyperactive club
that appeals to the T-shirt-and-sneakers theme-park crowd. Moody blue
lighting makes you believe you’re dancing the night away in deep space,
but the effect is more like . . . well, a cool dance floor.
Exploring Downtown Disney’s West Side
Immediately adjacent to Pleasure Island, Disney’s West Side is a district
where you’ll find clubs, restaurants, and DisneyQuest (see Chapter 16).
Singer Gloria Estefan and her husband, Emilio, created Bongos Cuban
Café (% 407-828-0999; www.bongoscubancafe.com), an eatery/
nightspot where a Desi Arnaz look-alike may show up to croon a few
tunes. The upbeat salsa music makes this place noisy, so flee to the
patio or upstairs if you want privacy. All in all, this isn’t one of Florida’s
better Cuban restaurants, so you’re better off coming for the atmos-
phere rather than the food (which will run you about $10–$26). The Café
is open daily from 11 a.m. to 2 a.m. and doesn’t take reservations. You
can find plenty of free self-parking.

Cirque du Soleil isn’t your ordinary circus. It doesn’t have any lions,
tigers, or bears. But you won’t feel cheated. This “Circus of the Sun” is
nonstop energy. At times, it seems as if all 64 performers are on stage
simultaneously, especially during the frenetic trampoline routine.
Trapeze artists, high-wire walkers, an airborne gymnast, a posing strong-
man, mimes, and two clowns cement a show called La Nouba into a five-
star performance. But if you’re on a tight budget, this is gut-check time:
Can you blow one or two day’s entertainment budget on 90 minutes of
fun? If you can, it’ll be worth the splurge. Tickets run $61 to $95 for
adults and $49 to $76 for kids 3 to 9 (plus tax). Don’t assume the cheaper
seats are the worst — there’s barely a bad seat to be had in this well-
designed theater. Shows are usually at 6 and 9 p.m. five nights a week,
but times and nights vary, and sometimes a matinee is scheduled, so call
ahead (% 407-939-7600) or check the show’s Web site (www.cirquedu
soleil.com) for information and tickets.
Plus-sized guests may find the seating a bit narrow, so request a folding
chair upon arrival.
The rafters in the House of Blues literally shake with rhythm and blues.
The House is decorated with folk art, buttons, and bottle caps, and the
patio has a view of the bay. If you like spicy food, offerings such as jam-
balaya and gumbo ($6–$18) are respectable. Sunday’s Gospel Brunch
($30 adults, $15 for kids 3–12) has foot-stomping music served with
decent food (omelets, beef, jalapeño smashed potatoes, cheese grits,
and sausage among meats and other items). Brunch is the only time you
can make reservations. Guests dining before attending a show that night
are often eligible for early admission, which is handy during the general-
admission shows. Ask your server for details, call % 407-934-2583, or
go to www.hob.com. House of Blues is open daily from 11 a.m. to 2 a.m.
and offers free self-parking.
Strolling Along Disney’s BoardWalk
Part of the same-named resort (see Chapter 9), the BoardWalk is home
to several clubs and restaurants and is a great place for strolling and
people-watching. Street performers sing, dance, juggle, and make a little
magic most evenings. It has something of a midway atmosphere reminis-
cent of Atlantic City’s heyday. Three standout options here include
 Atlantic Dance Hall features Top 40 and ’80s dance hits Tuesdays
through Thursdays and live bands on Friday and Saturday nights.
It’s open to everyone 21 and older from 9 p.m. to 2 a.m., and admis-
sion is free.
 The rustic, saloon-style Jellyrolls offers dueling pianos. Strictly 
for the over-21 set, it’s open daily from 7 p.m. to 2 a.m. There’s a $5
cover.
Part VI: Living It Up After Dark: Orlando Nightlife 
342

 If you need a game fix, ESPN Club has 90 TV screens (there are
even a few inside the bathrooms!), a full-service bar, food, and a
small arcade, all without a cover charge. It’s the sports mecca in
town.
You can get information on all of the spots listed here by calling % 407-
939-3463 or going to www.disneyworld.com.
Dancing the Night away at CityWalk
Universal’s answer to Pleasure Island is a two-level collection of clubs
and restaurants located between its two theme parks. CityWalk (% 407-
363-8000; www.universalorlando.com or www.citywalk.com) is open
from 11 a.m. to 2 a.m. daily. Although no admission is charged, several
clubs have cover charges after 5 or 6 p.m. and sometimes as late as 8 or
9 p.m. CityWalk also offers party passes. A pass to all clubs is $10 plus
tax; for $13 plus tax, you get a movie at Universal Cineplex (% 407-354-
5998). Universal also offers free club access to those who buy multiday
theme-park tickets (see Chapters 18 and 19). Daytime parking in the
Universal Orlando garages costs $10, but parking is free after 6 p.m.
Save your parking stub if attending a movie at the Universal Cineplex
before 6 p.m. The theater will allow you to apply the $10 parking fee
toward a concession-stand purchase any time that same day.
Bob Marley — A Tribute to Freedom (% 407-224-3663; www.bob
marley.com) has architecture said to replicate Marley’s home in
Kingston, Jamaica. Local and national reggae bands perform frequently.
Light Jamaican fare is served under umbrellas. The club is open daily
from 4 p.m. to 2 a.m. There’s a cover of $7 after 8 p.m.; cover prices
increase for concerts on special nights. You must be 21 or older after 
9 p.m.
CityJazz (% 407-224-2189) has a cover charge that includes the
Downbeat Jazz Hall of Fame (with memorabilia from Louis Armstrong,
Ella Fitzgerald, and other greats) and the Thelonious Monk Institute of
Jazz, a performance venue that’s also the site of jazz workshops. You can
browse through 500 pieces of memorabilia marching through Dixieland,
swing, bebop, and modern jazz. Nationally acclaimed acts perform fre-
quently. Thursday through Saturday, the club occasionally hosts national
and local comics via special Bonkers Comedy Club shows. On the food
side, look for tapas, sushi, and lamb chops. It’s open Sunday through
Thursday from 8 p.m. to 1 a.m. and Friday and Saturday from 7 p.m. to 2
a.m. Cover charge is $7 (more for special events). You must be 18 to enter.
CityWalk’s answer to Pleasure Island’s Mannequins Dance Palace is the
groove (% 407-363-8000); it’s not as crowded here, except on the occa-
sional all-ages teen night, when you’ll want to stay as far away from the
place as possible. The sound system is loud, and the dance floor is in a
room gleaming with chrome. Music-wise, the groove features hip-hop,

jazz fusion, techno, and alternative. A DJ plays tunes on nights when
recording artists aren’t booked. Each of the club’s three color-themed
lounges has a bar and a specialty drink to fit its ambience. You must be
at least 21 to enter (except for the special teen events), and it will cost
you a cover charge of $7. The club is open from 9 p.m. to 2 a.m., some-
times later.
CityWalk’s Hard Rock Cafe is the largest in the world, and the adjoining
Hard Rock Live (% 407-351-5483; www.hardrock.com) is the first con-
cert hall bearing the name. The cafe also has a free exhibit area, where
you can browse through displays of rock memorabilia, including the
platform heels and leather jumpsuits of KISS. Concert charges vary by
act, and MTV often films concert specials here. The cafe is open daily
from 11 a.m. to midnight.
Flip-flops and flowered shirts equal Jimmy Buffett’s Margaritaville 
(% 407-224-2155). Tunes are piped through the building during the day-
time, with a Jimmy sound-alike strumming on the back porch around
dusk. Inside, there’s nightly live entertainment, though nothing extraor-
dinary. Bar-wise, you have three options. The Volcano erupts (I’m not
kidding) killer margaritas; the Land Shark has fins swimming around the
ceiling; and the 12 Volt, is, well, a little electrifying. The menu screams
“Key West!” It includes Cheeseburgers in Paradise, mahimahi, and Key
lime pie. See Chapter 10 for more on the food front. Margaritaville is
open from 11 a.m. to 2 a.m., and there’s a $7 cover after 10 p.m.
Head over to the Red Coconut Club (% 407-224-3663), CityWalk’s new
two-story cocktail lounge (opening just as this book was going to print)
and you can sip martinis under the stars. An outdoor balcony offers the
perfect spot to sit and sip exotic concoctions while indoors offers a
more intimate (though somewhat louder) setting. Martinis, an extensive
wine list, and gourmet appetizers will keep you going all night long. Live
music and DJs crank the tunes out daily. The Red Coconut is open from 
5 p.m. to 2 a.m. daily, and there’s a $7 cover charge after 9 p.m.
The two-level Latin Quarter (% 407-224-3663) restaurant/club offers
you a chance to absorb the salsa-and-samba culture and cuisine of 21
Latin nations. It’s filled with the music of the merengue and the mambo,
with a little Latin rock thrown in for good measure. The sound system is
loud enough to blow you into the next county. The club is open Monday
through Friday from 4 p.m. until 10 p.m., Saturday and Sunday from noon
until 2 a.m.
Guessing the focus of a place that has a one-page food menu and a book-
let filled with drinks doesn’t take a genius. Just like the French Quarter’s
version, drinking is the highlight at Pat O’Brien’s (% 407-363-8000). You
can enjoy dueling pianos and a flame-throwing fountain while you suck
down the signature drink — the Hurricane. No one younger than 21 is
permitted after 9 p.m. Pat O’ Brien’s offers a limited menu of sand-
wiches, snacks, and treats like jambalaya and shrimp Creole, which sets
you back $6 to $10. Hours are 4 p.m. to 2 a.m.

Locating the Best Hotel Lounges
Some of Orlando’s best nightlife is located in its hotels. Even the locals
head to the resort areas for fun after dark. If you’re staying at one of the
places listed here, you can do an evening on the town without ever get-
ting behind the wheel. None of the following charges a cover.

Theatre on Saturday nights (see Chapter 24). And Auggie’s Jammin’
Piano Bar offers dueling pianos at 9 p.m. nightly at the Gaylord Palms
Resort & Convention Center (% 407-586-0000).
Exploring Orlando’s Other Hotspots
Downtown Orlando is home to a number of clubs and bars offering a
vibrant nightlife. Here’s my list of favorites:
 Club at Firestone, 578 N. Orange Ave., (% 407-426-0005; www.
clubatfirestone.com), is home to a revolving list of parties that
take place each day of the week. It continuously books some of the
best DJs in the dance-music scene to spin, especially on Saturdays
for the popular “gay night” party. The cover ranges from free to
$15, depending on the event. It’s open daily from 8 p.m. to 2 a.m.

 Locals perform at the 200-seat SAK Comedy Lab, 380 W. Amelia St.
(% 407-648-0001; www.sak.com), which offers several performances
weekly. Favorite acts include Duel of Fools, where two teams face off
in improvised scenes based on suggestions from the audience, and
Lab Rats, where students play in improv formats. Admission costs $5
to $13. Shows usually are Tuesday and Wednesday at 9 p.m. and
Thursday through Saturday at 8 and 10 p.m.
 The best spot in town for live music, The Social, 54 N. Orange Ave.
(% 407-246-1419; www.thesocial.org), offers an eclectic mix that
changes dramatically from night to night. You’re just as likely to
hear an urban groove as the next big punk band on the airwaves. A
$5 to $10 cover is charged for those 18 and older; national act
covers vary. It’s open daily from 8 p.m. to 2 a.m.
 Tabu Nightclub, 46 N. Orange Ave. (% 407-648-8363; www.tabu
nightclub.com), is one of the city’s hottest see-and-be-seen spots.
The Art Deco club boasts three dance floors and something of an
attitude. DJs spin hip-hop records and live bands provide addi-
tional music; the club also hosts theme nights. A private lounge for
VIPs means you may see a famous face or two. Leave the denim at
home, though — the club’s upscale dress code is strictly enforced.
Cover is $5 to $12 on most nights. It’s open Tuesday through
Sunday from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m.
 A handful of downtown hot spots are clustered in the Wall Street
district. Chillers, Big Belly Brewery, and Lattitudes (% 407-939-
4270), offer three very different experiences all in a single building.
The trio of clubs are all geared to the young adult crowd with an
atmosphere that’s very casual. Wall St. Plaza (www.wallstplaza.
net) is home to a wide variety of clubs including the Globe (% 407-
849-9904), a European patio cafe; Slingapours (% 407-849-9904), a
dance club with an indoor and outdoor patio for relaxing; Waitiki
(% 407-849-0471), a retro Tiki lounge and restaurant; and the
Monkey Bar (% 407-849-0471), a hip martini lounge and cocktail
bar. Hours and cover charges vary, so call ahead.

I
t may shock you to learn that there are things to see and do in this
city beyond Mickey, Shamu, and Shrek. I discuss some of the city’s
smaller but still-popular attractions in Chapter 21, but here are some
hidden gems, where you can dodge the enormous crowds, save a few
dollars, and still have a great time while others are still waiting in line or
emptying their wallets at the big parks.
Central Florida Zoo
The animal collection at the Central Florida Zoo includes a number of
endangered species including beautiful clouded leopards and cheetahs.
In addition to a lovable hippopotamus named Geraldine, you can also
meet black howler monkeys, siamangs, American crocodiles, a Gila mon-
ster, hyacinth macaws, bald eagles, and dozens of other species. The
latest additions to the park include a puma enclosure, a rare king vulture
exhibit, and an Australian exhibit featuring kangaroos and emus.
The park is located 20 to 30 minutes from Orlando at 3755 N. U.S. 17/92
in Sanford. (Take I-4 Exit 104, and follow the signs to the zoo.) Call % 407-
323-4450 for more information or visit www.centralfloridazoo.org
on the Web. Admission is $8.95 for adults, $6.95 for seniors 60 and older,
and $4.95 for kids 3 to 12 (children younger than 3 are free). Strollers are
available for rent at a cost of $3 or $6, depending on the type. The park
is open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and closes only on Thanksgiving and
Christmas.

Charles Hosmer Morse Museum 
of American Art
Louis Comfort Tiffany is in the spotlight at the Charles Hosmer Morse
Museum of American Art, and if you’re a fan of the artist, a stop here is a
must. This museum, founded in 1942, has 40 vibrantly colored windows
and 21 paintings by the master artist. In addition, there are non-Tiffany
windows ranging from creations by Frank Lloyd Wright to the works of
15th-century German masters. Also look for leaded lamps by Tiffany 
and Emile Gallè; paintings by John Singer Sargent and Maxfield Parrish;
jewelry designed by Tiffany, Lalique, and Fabergé; and Art Nouveau 
furnishings.
The museum is at 445 Park Ave. N., in Winter Park. (Take the I-4 Fairbanks
Avenue exit east to Park Avenue, and then go left and through four traffic
lights.) Call % 407-645-5311 or 407-645-5324 (a telephone recording) for

Cornell Fine Arts Museum

paintings, sculpture, and decorative art), making it one of Florida’s most
distinguished and comprehensive art collections. The museum also con-
ducts lectures and gallery-talk walks.

for more information.
Eatonville and the Zora Neale Hurston
National Museum of Fine Arts
America’s oldest black municipality is located just north of Orlando.
Eatonville is the birthplace of Zora Neale Hurston — a too-little 
heralded, African-American author. The best time to visit is in January
during the city’s annual festival honoring her and her work. A small
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
354

gallery on the site displays periodically changing exhibits of art and
other work, and you can grab a map for a walking tour of the community,
established in 1887.
The museum is at 227 E. Kennedy Blvd., Eatonville. (Take I-4 to Exit 46
and make a quick left onto Lee Road, then left on Wymore, and then

Audubon Center for Birds of Prey
This bird sanctuary — one of the largest rehabilitation centers in the
Southeast — has treated more than 8,000 raptors and released more
than 3,500 of them back into the wild since opening in 1979. It flies under
the radar of most tourists, making it a great place to get to know the
winged wonders (eagles, owls, hawks, and other raptors) that earn their
keep by entertaining those who do visit. It’s a wonderful place for nature
lovers and kids who love getting up close with the feathered residents.
The center is at 1101 Audubon Way, Maitland. (Take I-4 to Lee Road/
Exit 46 and exit right; turn left at the first light [Wymore Road], and turn
right at the next light [Kennedy Boulevard]. Continue a half-mile to East
Avenue, turn left, and go to the stop sign at Audubon Way. Turn left, and

offlorida.org/conservation/cbop.htm for more information. The
center accepts donations: $5 adults, $4 children 3 to 12. Visitor hours
are Tuesday through Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Kissimmee Sports Arena & Rodeo
The Kissimmee Sports Arena & Rodeo is a good way to fill a Friday-
night dance card, and it’s only 20 minutes from the major theme parks.
The arena stages weekly contests where real-life cowboys compete in
several events, including saddle bronc and bull-riding, calf-roping, and
barrel-racing.
The arena is located at 958 S. Hoagland Blvd., Kissimmee. (Take I-4 Exit
25A/U.S. 192 east to Hoagland, and then go south 1 mile to the arena.)

age 12 and younger. The fun begins Friday evenings at 8 p.m. It’s closed
in December.

One of the best shows in town is short, but sweet — and free. The posh
Peabody Orlando hotel’s five mallards march into the lobby each morn-
ing, accompanied by John Philip Sousa’s “King Cotton March” and their
own red-coated duck master. They get to spend the day splashing in a
marble fountain. Then, in the afternoon, they march back to the elevator
and up to their fourth-floor “penthouse.”

and Sand Lake Road). Call % 800-732-2639 or 407-352-4000 for more

ant some exercise other than pounding theme-park pavement?
Walt Disney World and the surrounding areas offer plenty of
recreational jaunts to keep even the most active people busy. The major-
ity of these activities are most convenient for guests of Disney’s resorts

sive facilities as well. The facilities I describe in this chapter are open to
the public, regardless of where you’re staying. For further information,

Fishing
Disney offers a variety of fishing excursions (catch and release only) on

9-hole, par-36 walking course. All are open to the public and offer pro
shops, equipment rentals, and instruction. The rates are $69 to $165 per

you play. Twilight specials (for play after the hours of either 3 or 5 p.m.)

Jogging
Many Disney resorts have scenic jogging trails. For example, the Yacht
Club and Beach Club resorts share a 2-mile trail; the Caribbean Beach
Resort’s 1.4-mile promenade circles a lake; Port Orleans Resort has a
1.7-mile riverfront trail; and Fort Wilderness’s tree-shaded 2.3-mile 
jogging path has exercise stations about every quarter-mile. Pick up a
jogging-trail map at any Disney property’s Guest Relations desk.
Surfing
The creative minds at Disney have added a way for you to find out how
to catch a wave and “hang ten” at the Typhoon Lagoon water park. (See
Chapter 16 for the park listing.) Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays,
instructors from Carroll’s Cocoa Beach Surfing School (% 407-939-
7529) show up for an early-bird session in the namesake lagoon, which
has a wave machine capable of 8-footers. The 21⁄2-hour session is held
before the park opens to the general public. It’s limited to 14 people.
Minimum age is 8. The $135 cost doesn’t include park admission, which
you must pay if you want to hang around after the lesson.

If you’re staying at WDW and don’t have a rental car, note that you can’t
use the Disney Transportation system to get to the park for the 7:30 a.m.
start time of the lessons; the buses don’t operate that early.
Ron Jon Surf Park, the coolest place to catch a wave inland, opened in
late 2006 at Festival Bay (located at the northernmost end of International
Drive). Three separate pools, the Big Pool, the Boogie Pool, and the
Beginners Pool, ensure everyone can hang ten here. Lessons and equip-
ment rentals are available. Surf over to www.ronjons.com for the most
up-to-date information.
Swimming
Orlando is home to an amazing number and variety of swimming pools.
Whiling away the heat of the afternoon at a pool is a great way to
recharge your batteries and cool off after a morning of pounding the
pavement at the parks. Keep in mind, however, that you won’t be the
only one to think that an afternoon retreat is a good idea — at times, 
the pools can seem as crowded as the parks.
Tennis
Twenty-six lighted tennis courts are scattered throughout the Disney
properties (including ten at Disney’s Wide World of Sports Complex).
Most are free and available to resort guests on a first-come, first-served
basis. The Racquet Club at the Contemporary Resort has six clay courts
(here reservations are required and court time runs $8 an hour), all
lighted for evening play, and offers lessons ($75 per hour private, $15 for
a group clinic). Call % 407-939-7529 to make reservations or for more
information.
Water-skiing and Wakeboarding
You can arrange water-skiing trips (including boats, drivers, equipment,
and instruction) Tuesday through Saturday at Walt Disney World by
calling % 407-824-2621 or 407-939-7529. Make reservations up to 14
days in advance. The cost for skiing is $140 per hour for up to five
people. Wakeboarding is $140 per hour for up to four people. You also
can wakeboard and ski at the Sammy Duvall’s Watersports Centre at

com); it costs $140 per hour. Parasailing is available as well; for a single
rider, the cost is $90 to $113, tandem runs $140 to $163.
Chapter 27: Top Ten Fitness Activities in Orlando 361

You can snorkel at Typhoon Lagoon (see Chapter 16). Scuba-diving is
available at Epcot’s Dive Quest at the Living Seas Pavilion (see Chap-
ter 13). Outside Disney, you can get some time behind a boat or at the
end of an overhead cable at the Orlando Watersports Complex, which
has lights for nighttime thrill-seekers. The complex is located close to
Orlando International Airport at 8615 Florida Rock Rd. Prices for wake-
boarding or water-skiing, including lessons, runs $45 a half-hour, $180 for
all you can ride. If you want to ride on the cable, it will cost $21 for an
hour and $39 for all day. Basic equipment is included in the rental price,
but if you prefer the more advanced stuff, you can rent it separately at
the pro shop. For information, call % 407-251-3100 or go to www.

www.all-about-kids.com). Child-care
rates usually run somewhere between $10
and $15 per hour for the first child and $1 to
$3 per additional child, per hour, with an
additional transportation fee of $8 to $10.
Several of Walt Disney World’s more expen-
sive resorts also have child-care centers
that cater to kids ages 4 to 12. If you’d like
to take advantage of the kids’ programs and
enjoy a few hours off, advance reservations
are a must; call % 407-939-3463. All three
Universal Orlando resorts offer similar 
services.
Business Hours
Theme-park operating hours vary depend-
ing on the time of year and the day of the
week. Although most open at 8 or 9 a.m.
and close at 6 or 7 p.m., you should call or
check a park’s Web site for its most current
schedule before arriving. Other businesses
are generally open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.,
Monday through Friday. Bars are usually
open until 2 a.m., with some after-hours
clubs staying open into the wee hours of
the morning (though the alcohol stops flow-
ing at 2 a.m.).
Camera Repair
All Disney theme parks have a photo shop
where you can get minor camera repairs or
pick up an extra battery (check for loca-
tions in the park guide maps you get upon
entering). For more serious repair work, try
Southern Photo Technical Service, 606
Virginia Dr. (% 407-896-0322; www.spts-
orlando.com).

Convention Center
Orlando’s Orange County Convention
Center (% 407-345-9800; www.occc.
net) is located at 9800 International Dr.
Credit Cards
Call the following emergency numbers if
you lose your card or your wallet is stolen:
American Express (% 800-221-7282),
MasterCard (% 800-307-7309 or 636-722-
7111), Visa (% 800-847-2911 or 410-581-
9994). For other credit cards, call the toll-
free number directory at % 800-555-1212.
Doctors and Dentists
For minor problems that occur during a
theme-park visit (blisters, allergic reac-
tions), visit the park’s first aid center; these
are noted on the park maps you pick up
when you enter. Disney offers in-room
medical service 24 hours a day by calling
% 407-238-2000. Doctors on Call Service
(% 407-399-3627) makes house and room
calls in most of the Orlando area. Centra-
Care has several walk-in clinics listed in
the Yellow Pages, including ones on
Vineland Road near Universal Orlando 
(% 407-351-6682), at Lake Buena Vista
near Disney (% 407-934-2273), and in
Kissimmee near Disney (% 407-397-7032).
After Hours Pediatrics (% 407-827-7113),
located in Lake Buena Vista, offers urgent
care for children and young adults (up to
age 21). There’s also a 24-hour, toll-free
number for the Poison Control Center 
(% 800-282-3171). To find a dentist, call
Dental Referral Service (% 800-235-4111;
www.dentalreferral.com). Folks
there can tell you the nearest dentist who
meets your needs. Phones are staffed
weekdays from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Check 
the Yellow Pages for 24-hour emergency
services.
Emergencies
Florida uses % 911 as the emergency
number for police, fire departments, 
ambulances, and other critical needs. If
you have a cellular phone and need urgent
help, dial % *FHP for the Florida Highway
Patrol.
For less-urgent requests, call % 800-647-
9284, a hot line sponsored by the Florida
Tourism Industry Marketing Corporation,
the state tourism promotion board. With
operators speaking more than 100 lan-
guages, this service can provide general
directions and help with lost travel papers
and credit cards, medical emergencies,
accidents, money transfers, airline confir-
mation, and much more.
Hospitals
Sand Lake Hospital, 9400 Turkey Lake Rd.
(% 407-351-8550), is about 2 miles south of
Sand Lake Road. From the WDW area, take
I-4 to the Sand Lake Road exit, turn left off
the exit ramp onto Sand Lake Road, and
make a left on Turkey Lake Road. The hos-
pital is 2 miles on your right. The Florida
Hospital, 400 Celebration Place (% 407-
764-4000), is located near the tourist area
of Kissimmee just off of U.S. 192 not far
from Disney. Take U.S 192 East and turn
right onto Celebration Place; the hospital is
about a half-mile up on your left.
Information
To get local telephone information, call 
% 411.
For local tourism information, see the
“Where to Get More Information” section
at the end of the Quick Concierge.
Internet Access and Cybercafes
Orlando doesn’t have too many cyber-
cafes (you’re supposed to be having fun in
the theme parks!), and the ones it does
have are generally far from the tourist
zones. At Walt Disney World, there is an
Internet cafe inside DisneyQuest (see
Chapter 16), and you can also send e-mail
Walt Disney World & Orlando For Dummies 2007 
364

at Innoventions in Epcot (see Chapter 13),
though you have to pay the park admission
fees to use the Web terminals. Payphones
with touch-screen displays offering
Internet access have been installed at
locations throughout WDW; you can
access your e-mail for 25¢ a minute with a
four-minute minimum.
If you’re traveling with your laptop, most
Orlando hotels offer in-room dataports,
and many offer high-speed access (ask
about access fees when booking your
room) with an increasing number offering
Wi-Fi in public areas (again, be sure to ask
about access fees). Check with your hotel
for the most up-to-date information as to
what type of service it currently offers and
what it charges to use the service. Disney
offers high-speed and limited Wi-Fi access
to guests at several of its resorts, and all
Universal Orlando resorts offer high-speed
Internet access.
Liquor Laws
Florida’s liquor laws are pretty straightfor-
ward. You must be 21 to buy or consume
alcohol. Alcohol is sold in supermarkets
and liquor stores daily from 9 a.m. to 2 a.m.
It’s served at bars and restaurants from 
11 a.m. to 2 a.m. Some places that serve
liquor allow you to enter if you’re younger
than 21, but most won’t let you sit at the
bar.
Note: No liquor is served in Magic
Kingdom at Walt Disney World. Alcoholic
drinks are available, however, at the other
Disney parks and are quite evident at
Universal Orlando’s parks (even more so at
its seasonal celebrations).
Maps
AAA (see “AAA,” above in this appendix)
and other auto clubs generally provide
good maps (to members), as do many
Orlando rental-car agencies. The
Orlando/Orange County Convention &
Visitors Bureau, FLAUSA (Florida’s official
tourist bureau), and the Kissimmee/St.
Cloud Visitors Bureau all offer an array of
area maps (which can be sent via U.S. mail
upon request or picked up locally).
Pharmacies
There are 24-hour Walgreens at 7650 W.
Sand Lake Rd. (% 407-345-9497) and 5935
W. Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy./U.S. 192
(% 407-396-2002). Many other locations
near tourist areas can be found by check-
ing the local phone directory or logging on
to www.walgreens.com.
Post Office
The post office most convenient to Disney
and Universal is at 10450 Turkey Lake Rd.
(% 800-275-8777). It’s open Monday
through Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.,
Saturday from 9 a.m. to noon. Additionally,
there is a post office located at 12133
Apopka–Vineland (% 800-275-8777), close
to Downtown Disney.
Restrooms
You won’t find any public restrooms on the
streets in Orlando, but you can usually find
one in a bar, restaurant, hotel, museum,
department store, convenience store,
attraction, fast-food eatery, or service 
station — and it’ll probably be clean. (You
may have to purchase something to gain
entrance, because many of these places
reserve their restrooms for patrons only.)
All the major theme parks have an abun-
dance of clean restrooms, many of which
also have baby-changing facilities (all are
clearly marked on the guide maps you get
upon entering the park).
Safety
Don’t let the aura of Mickey Mouse allow
you to lower your guard. Orlando has a
crime rate that’s comparable to other
major U.S. cities. Stay alert and remain
Appendix: Quick Concierge 365

aware of your immediate surroundings.
Keeping your valuables in a safe-deposit
box (inquire at your hotel’s front desk) is a
good idea, although many hotels are
equipped with in-room safes. Keep a close
eye on your valuables when you’re in a
public place, such as a restaurant, theater,
or airport terminal. Renting a locker is
always preferable to leaving your valu-
ables in the trunk of your car, even in the
theme-park lots. Be cautious and avoid
carrying large amounts of cash, especially
if you’re carrying a backpack or fanny
pack, which thieves can easily access
while you’re standing in line for a ride or
show. If you’re renting a car, carefully read
the safety instructions that the rental com-
pany provides. Never stop in a dark or
unpopulated area. Remember that children
should never ride in the front seat of a car
equipped with air bags and those age 3
and younger must be in a child safety seat;
those ages 4 and 5 must either be in a
safety seat or booster seat, or wearing a
seatbelt.
Smoking
Restaurant space and hotel rooms for
smokers are evaporating in Orlando.
Disney doesn’t sell tobacco, and there are
precious few “you can smoke here” areas.
And don’t expect to light up over dinner.
Florida bans smoking in public workplaces,
including restaurants and bars that serve
food. Stand-alone bars that serve virtually
no food and designated smoking rooms in
hotels are exempt.
Taxes
Expect to add 11 or 12 percent to room
rates and 6.5 to 7 percent (the rate
depends on the county you happen to be
in) on most everything else — except 
groceries and health supplies or medical
services.
Taxis
Yellow Cab (% 407-699-9999) and Ace
Metro (% 407-855-0564) are among the
cab companies serving the area. Rates run
as high as $3.25 for the first mile, $1.75 per
mile thereafter.
Time Zone
Orlando is on eastern standard time from
late fall until mid-spring, and on eastern
daylight time (one hour later) the rest of
the year. That means that when both of
Mickey’s gloved hands are on 12 noon in
Orlando, it’s 7 a.m. in Honolulu, 8 a.m. in
Anchorage, 9 a.m. in Vancouver and Los
Angeles, 11 a.m. in Winnipeg and New
Orleans, and 5 p.m. in London.
Transit Info
Lynx (% 407-841-5969;
www.golynx.com) bus stops are marked
with a paw print. The buses serve Disney,
Universal, and International Drive ($1.50 for
adults, 75¢ for seniors and kids enrolled in
K–12 with valid school ID), but they’re not
particularly tourist-friendly. The Inter-
national Drive area has the I-Ride Trolley
(% 407-248-9590; www.iridetrolley.
com). The Main Line and Green Line stops
include most of I-Drive from SeaWorld on
the south end and Prime Factory Outlet
World on the north. Trolleys run about
every 20 minutes with 85 stops along the
Main Line and about every 30 minutes with
22 stops along the Green Line. It runs from
8 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. ($1 for adults, 25¢ for
seniors, and kids younger than 12 are free
with a paying adult; one-day and multiday
passes are also available; exact change 
is required) and is a good way to avoid 
I-Drive’s dreadfully heavy traffic.

Where to Get More Information
If you want additional information on attractions, accommodations, or
just about anything else that’s in Orlando, the city has some excellent
sources for tourist information, discounts, maps, and more.
Orlando tourist information offices
The Orlando/Orange County Convention & Visitors Bureau can answer
your questions regarding area attractions, dining, and accommodations,
as well as send you maps and brochures. You should receive the packet in
about three weeks, and it includes the Magicard, which is good for hun-
dreds of dollars in discounts on accommodations, car rentals, attractions,
and more. Orlando’s Official Visitors Center is located at 8723 Inter-
national Dr., Suite 101, Orlando, FL 32819. For information, call % 407-
363-5872 (voice — you can talk to a real person!), 800-643-9492, or 800-
551-0181 (automated). Or log on to the Internet to www.orlandoinfo.com.
Get your info straight from the Mouse’s mouth. Contact Walt Disney
World, Box 10000, Lake Buena Vista, FL 32830-1000 (% 407-934-7639;
www.disneyworld.com), to order vacation brochures and get informa-
tion on all the theme parks, attractions, dining, accommodations, and
more.

For information on Universal Studios Florida, Islands of Adventure,
and CityWalk, contact Universal Orlando, 1000 Universal Studios
Plaza, Orlando, FL 32819 (% 407-363-8000; www.universalorlando.
com). They will also send you vacation brochures, including informa-
tion on restaurants and accommodations.
SeaWorld offers vacation brochures with information on the park, its
restaurants, its hotel partners, and on Discovery Cove, where you
can swim with dolphins. Write to 7007 SeaWorld Dr., Orlando, FL
32801, or call % 407-351-3600. Online, surf over to www.seaworld.
com. For information on Discovery Cove, call % 877-434-7268 or
head to www.discoverycove.com.
Get in touch with the Kissimmee–St. Cloud Convention and Visitors
Bureau, 1925 E. Irlo Bronson Hwy./U.S. 192, Kissimmee, FL 34744 
(% 800-327-9159 or 407-847-5000; www.floridakiss.com), for maps,
brochures, coupon books, and a guide to local accommodations and
attractions.
Newspapers and magazines
Check out the Sunday travel section in your hometown paper for the
latest bargains, ideas, and tips. After you land in O-Town, pick up a
copy of the Orlando Sentinel (www.orlandosentinel.com) to find
out about current events and deals. Go2Orlando (www.go2orlando.
com) is the Sentinel’s online section dedicated to visitors. The paper’s
Calendar and CityBeat sections are gold mines for current informa-
tion on the area’s accommodations, restaurants, nightclubs, and
attractions, as is the Orlando Weekly (www.orlandoweekly.com).
Other sources of information
 Travel Insights Group (www.travel-insights.com) is a 
great source of information for families traveling with children. 
If you’re headed to Walt Disney World, Universal Orlando,
SeaWorld, or even the coastal areas of central Florida, the insider
travel and theme-park touring tips, hotel and restaurant reviews,
and other helpful hints found are invaluable for families hoping
to survive their central Florida vacation and still have fun.
 Visit www.icflorida.com for information about dining, clubs,
performances, theme parks, sports, and special events.
 Deb’s Unofficial Walt Disney World Information Guide (The
All Ears Net; http://wdwig.com, www.allearsnet.com) is an
excellent information source and arguably the best unofficial
Disney guide on the Internet. Though Disney doesn’t own it, it’s
run and written by true-blue fans of Mickey, so although it’s not
entirely objective (and you should take that into consideration
when looking at the tips it offers) the information is extremely
Walt Disney World & Orlando For Dummies 2007 
370

detailed and up to date. There are also sections aimed at travel-
ers with special needs that include good tips for touring the
Disney parks if you’re physically challenged, elderly, or with 
kids in tow.
 Frommer’s Walt Disney World & Orlando with Kids, by Laura
Lea Miller, has lots of tips and advice for those traveling with
children ages 2 to 16, while Frommer’s Irreverent Guide to
Walt Disney World, by Chris Mohney, is a fun-filled guide aimed
at singles and couples (both books are published by Wiley).
