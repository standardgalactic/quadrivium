Dedication
In loving memory of Jesse Edward Sprague, my best friend in the whole 
world — a man who never met a stranger.
“Friends have all things in common” —Plato
Author’s Acknowledgments
One thing I have to tell you about writing a For Dummies book — it’s an 
incredible amount of fun. You get to air out your ideas in a friendly, conver-
sational way, and you get a chance to throw in some humor, too. To write a 
second edition is almost more fun than one writer should be allowed to have. 
I worked again with a terrifi c team. Acquisitions Editor Stephanie McComb 
and Project Editor Beth Taylor of Wiley Publishing have been encouraging, 
cooperative, and patient. Technical Editor Namir Shammas helped make this 
book as technically bulletproof as possible. Any errors that remain are under 
the sole proprietorship of the author. My deepest thanks to Stephanie and 
Beth. My thanks to Waterside Productions for representing me in this effort. 
Again I thank mentors in college and graduate school who helped shape my 
statistical knowledge: Mitch Grossberg (Brooklyn College); Mort Goldman, 
Al Hillix, Larry Simkins, and Jerry Sheridan (University of Missouri-Kansas 
City); and Cliff Gillman and John Theios (University of Wisconsin-Madison). 
A long time ago at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, Mort Goldman 
exempted me from a graduate statistics fi nal on one condition — that I learn 
the last course topic, Analysis of Covariance, on my own. I hope he’s happy 
with Appendix B.
I thank my mother and my brother David for their love and support and for 
always being there for me, and Kathryn for so much more than I can say. 
Finally, a special note of thanks to my friend Brad, who suggested this whole 
thing in the fi rst place!

Statistical Analysis with Excel For Dummies, 2nd Edition

Introduction
W
hat? Yet another statistics book? Well . . . this is a statistics book, all 
right, but in my humble (and thoroughly biased) opinion, it’s not just 
another statistics book. 
What? Yet another Excel book? Same thoroughly biased opinion — it’s not 
just another Excel book. What? Yet another edition of a book that’s not just 
another statistics book and not just another Excel book? Well . . . yes. You got 
me there.
So here’s the deal — for the previous edition and for this one. Many statistics 
books teach you the concepts but don’t give you a way to apply them. That 
often leads to a lack of understanding. With Excel, you have a ready-made 
package for applying statistics concepts. 
Looking at it from the opposite direction, many Excel books show you Excel’s 
capabilities but don’t tell you about the concepts behind them. Before I tell 
you about an Excel statistical tool, I give you the statistical foundation it’s 
based on. That way, you understand the tool when you use it — and you use 
it more effectively. 
I didn’t want to write a book that’s just “select this menu” and “click this 
button.” Some of that is necessary, of course, in any book that shows you 
how to use a software package. My goal was to go way beyond that.
I also didn’t want to write a statistics “cookbook”: When-faced-with-problem-
#310-use-statistical-procedure-#214. My goal was to go way beyond that, too.
Bottom line: This book isn’t just about statistics or just about Excel — it sits 
firmly at the intersection of the two. In the course of telling you about statis-
tics, I cover every Excel statistical feature. (Well . . . almost. I left one out. I left 
it out of the first edition, too. It’s called “Fourier Analysis.” All the necessary 
math to understand it would take a whole book, and you might never use this 
tool, anyway.)
About This Book
Although statistics involves a logical progression of concepts, I organized 
this book so you can open it up in any chapter and start reading. The idea is 

2
Statistical Analysis For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
for you to find what you’re looking for in a hurry and use it immediately — 
whether it’s a statistical concept or an Excel tool. 
On the other hand, cover to cover is okay if you’re so inclined. If you’re a sta-
tistics newbie and you have to use Excel for statistical analysis, I recommend 
you begin at the beginning — even if you know Excel pretty well.
What You Can Safely Skip
Any reference book throws a lot of information at you, and this one is no 
exception. I intended it all to be useful, but I didn’t aim it all at the same level. 
So if you’re not deeply into the subject matter, you can avoid paragraphs 
marked with the Technical Stuff icon.
Every so often, you’ll run into sidebars. They provide information that elabo-
rates on a topic, but they’re not part of the main path. If you’re in a hurry, 
you can breeze past them.
Because I wrote this book so you can open it up anywhere and start using 
it, step-by-step instructions appear throughout. Many of the procedures I 
describe have steps in common. After you go through some of the procedures, 
you can probably skip the first few steps when you come to a procedure you 
haven’t been through before.
Foolish Assumptions
This is not an introductory book on Excel or on Windows, so I’m assuming:
 
✓ You know how to work with Windows. I don’t go through the details of 
pointing, clicking, selecting, and so forth.
 
✓ You have Excel installed on your computer and you can work along with 
the examples. I don’t take you through the steps of Excel installation. 
Incidentally, I use Excel 2007 (running in Windows Vista). If you’re using 
Excel 97, Excel 2000, or Excel 2003, that’s okay. The statistical functional-
ity is the same. Some of the screen shots in the book will look a little dif-
ferent from what appears on your computer, however. 
 
 Also, Excel 2007 has an entirely new user interface, so getting to the sta-
tistical functionality is somewhat different from previous versions.
 
✓ You’ve worked with Excel before, and you understand the essentials of 
worksheets and formulas.
If you don’t know much about Excel, consider looking into Greg Harvey’s excel-
lent Excel books in the For Dummies series. His latest work covers Excel 2007.

 Introduction
How This Book Is Organized
I organized this book into five parts and three appendixes. 
Part I: Statistics and Excel: A Marriage 
Made in Heaven
In Part I, I provide a general introduction to statistics and to Excel’s statisti-
cal capabilities. I discuss important statistical concepts and describe useful 
Excel techniques. If it’s a long time since your last course in statistics or if 
you never had a statistics course at all, start here. If you haven’t worked with 
Excel’s built-in functions (of any kind) definitely start here. 
Part II: Describing Data
Part of statistics is to take sets of numbers and summarize them in meaningful 
ways. Here’s where you find out how to do that. We all know about averages 
and how to compute them. But that’s not the whole story. In this part, I tell you 
about additional statistics that fill in the gaps, and I show you how to use Excel 
to work with those statistics. I also introduce Excel graphics in this part.
Part III: Drawing Conclusions from Data
Part III addresses the fundamental aim of statistical analysis: to go beyond 
the data and help decision-makers make decisions. Usually, the data are mea-
surements of a sample taken from a large population. The goal is to use these 
data to figure out what’s going on in the population. 
This opens a wide range of questions: What does an average mean? What 
does the difference between two averages mean? Are two things associated? 
These are only a few of the questions I address in Part III, and I discuss the 
Excel functions and tools that help you answer them.
Part IV: Working with Probability
Probability is the basis for statistical analysis and decision-making. In Part IV, 
I tell you all about it. I show you how to apply probability, particularly in the 
area of modeling. Excel provides a rich set of built-in capabilities that help 
you understand and apply probability. Here’s where you find them.

Statistical Analysis For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
Part V: The Part of Tens
Part V meets two objectives. First, I get to stand on the soapbox and rant 
about statistical peeves and about helpful hints. The peeves and hints total 
up to ten. Also, I discuss ten (okay, twelve) Excel things I couldn’t fit in any 
other chapter. They come from all over the world of statistics. If it’s Excel 
and statistical, and if you can’t find it anywhere else in the book, you’ll find 
it here. 
As I said in the first edition — pretty handy, this Part of Tens.
Appendix A: When Your Worksheet 
Is a Database
In addition to performing calculations, Excel serves another purpose: record-
keeping. Although it’s not a dedicated database, Excel does offer some 
database functions. Some of them are statistical in nature. I introduce Excel 
database functions in Appendix A, along with pivot tables that allow you to 
turn your database inside out and look at your data in different ways.
Appendix B: The Analysis of Covariance
This is new in this edition. The Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) is a statisti-
cal technique that combines two other techniques — analysis of variance and 
regression analysis. If you know how two variables are related, you can use 
that knowledge in some nifty ways, and this is one of the ways. The kicker is 
that Excel doesn’t have a built-in tool for ANCOVA — but I show you how to 
use what Excel does have so you can get the job done. 
Appendix C: Of Stems, Leaves, Boxes, 
Whiskers, and Smoothies
This is another addition to this edition. Statisticians often use special tech-
niques to explore and visualize data, and Appendix C covers some of those 
techniques. They’re not built into Excel. As is the case with ANCOVA, how-
ever, I show you how to use Excel’s capabilities to implement them.

 Introduction
Icons Used in This Book
As is the case with all For Dummies books, icons appear all over. Each one is 
a little picture in the margin that lets you know something special about the 
paragraph it’s next to.
 
This icon points out a hint or a shortcut that helps you in your work and 
makes you an all-around better human being.
 
This one points out timeless wisdom to take with you long after you finish this 
book, grasshopper.
 
Pay attention to this icon. It’s a reminder to avoid something that might gum 
up the works for you.
 
As I mentioned in “What You Can Safely Skip,” this icon indicates material you 
can blow past if statistics and Excel aren’t your passion. 
Where to Go from Here
You can start the book anywhere, but here are a few hints. Want to learn the 
foundations of statistics? Turn the page. Introduce yourself to Excel’s statisti-
cal features? That’s Chapter 2. Want to start with graphics? Hit Chapter 3. For 
anything else, find it in the Table of Contents or in the Index and go for it.
Same final admonition as in the first edition: If you have half as much fun 
reading and using this book as I had writing it, you’ll have a blast.

Part I
Statistics and 
Excel: A Marriage 
Made in Heaven

In this part . . . 
P
art I deals with the foundations of statistics and with 
the statistics-related things that Excel can do. On the 
statistics side, this part introduces samples and popula-
tions, hypothesis testing, the two types of errors in deci-
sion-making, independent and dependent variables, and 
probability. It’s a brief introduction to all the statistical 
concepts I explore in the rest of the book. On the Excel 
side, I focus on cell referencing and on how to use work-
sheet functions, array functions, and data analysis tools. 
My objective is to get you thinking about statistics con-
ceptually and about Excel as a statistical analysis tool.

T
he field of statistics is all about decision-making — decision-making 
based on groups of numbers. Statisticians constantly ask questions: 
What do the numbers tell us? What are the trends? What predictions can we 
make? What conclusions can we draw?
To answer these questions, statisticians have developed an impressive array 
of analytical tools. These tools help us to make sense of the mountains of 
data that are out there waiting for us to delve into, and to understand the 
numbers we generate in the course of our own work.
The Statistical (And Related) Notions 
You Just Have to Know
Because intensive calculation is often part and parcel of the statistician’s 
toolset, many people have the misconception that statistics is about number 
crunching. Number crunching is just one small part of the path to sound deci-
sions, however.

10
Part I: Statistics and Excel: A Marriage Made in Heaven 
By shouldering the number-crunching load, software increases our speed of 
traveling down that path. Some software packages are specialized for statisti-
cal analysis and contain many of the tools that statisticians use. Although 
not marketed specifically as a statistical package, Excel provides a number of 
these tools, which is why I wrote this book.
I said that number crunching is a small part of the path to sound decisions. 
The most important part is the concepts statisticians work with, and that’s 
what I talk about for most of the rest of this chapter.
Samples and populations
On election night, TV commentators routinely predict the outcome of elec-
tions before the polls close. Most of the time they’re right. How do they 
do that?
The trick is to interview a sample of voters after they cast their ballots. 
Assuming the voters tell the truth about whom they voted for, and assuming 
the sample truly represents the population, network analysts use the sample 
data to generalize to the population of voters. 
This is the job of a statistician — to use the findings from a sample to make a 
decision about the population from which the sample comes. But sometimes 
those decisions don’t turn out the way the numbers predicted. History buffs 
are probably familiar with the memorable picture of President Harry Truman 
holding up a copy of the Chicago Daily Tribune with the famous, but wrong, 
headline “Dewey Defeats Truman” after the 1948 election. Part of the statisti-
cian’s job is to express how much confidence he or she has in the decision.
Another election-related example speaks to the idea of the confidence in 
the decision. Pre-election polls (again, assuming a representative sample of 
voters) tell you the percentage of sampled voters who prefer each candidate. 
The polling organization adds how accurate they believe the polls are. When 
you hear a newscaster say something like “accurate to within three percent,” 
you’re hearing a judgment about confidence.
Here’s another example. Suppose you’ve been assigned to find the average 
reading speed of all fifth-grade children in the U.S., but you haven’t got the 
time or the money to test them all. What would you do? 
Your best bet is to take a sample of fifth-graders, measure their reading 
speeds (in words per minute), and calculate the average of the reading 
speeds in the sample. You can then use the sample average as an estimate of 
the population average. 

11
 Chapter 1: Evaluating Data in the Real World
Estimating the population average is one kind of inference that statisticians 
make from sample data. I discuss inference in more detail in the upcoming 
section “Inferential Statistics.” 
 
Now for some terminology you have to know: Characteristics of a population 
(like the population average) are called parameters, and characteristics of a 
sample (like the sample average) are called statistics. When you confine your 
field of view to samples, your statistics are descriptive. When you broaden 
your horizons and concern yourself with populations, your statistics are 
inferential.
 
Now for a notation convention you have to know: Statisticians use Greek let-
ters (μ, σ, ρ) to stand for parameters, and English letters , s, r) to stand for 
statistics. Figure 1-1 summarizes the relationship between populations and 
samples, and parameters and statistics.

Variables: Dependent and independent
Simply put, a variable is something that can take on more than one value. 
(Something that can have only one value is called a constant.) Some variables 
you might be familiar with are today’s temperature, the Dow Jones Industrial 
Average, your age, and the value of the dollar against the euro.
Statisticians care about two kinds of variables, independent and dependent. 
Each kind of variable crops up in any study or experiment, and statisticians 
assess the relationship between them.
For example, imagine a new way of teaching reading that’s intended to 
increase the reading speed of fifth-graders. Before putting this new method 
into schools, it would be a good idea to test it. To do that, a researcher would 
randomly assign a sample of fifth-grade students to one of two groups: One 

12
Part I: Statistics and Excel: A Marriage Made in Heaven 
group receives instruction via the new method, the other receives instruction 
via traditional methods. Before and after both groups receive instruction, 
the researcher measures the reading speeds of all the children in this study. 
What happens next? I get to that in the upcoming section entitled “Inferential 
Statistics: Testing Hypotheses.”
For now, understand that the independent variable here is Method of 
Instruction. The two possible values of this variable are New and Traditional. 
The dependent variable is reading speed — which we might measure in 
words per minute.
 
In general, the idea is to try and find out if changes in the independent variable 
are associated with changes in the dependent variable.
 
In the examples that appear throughout the book, I show you how to use Excel 
to calculate various characteristics of groups of scores. Keep in mind that 
each time I show you a group of scores, I’m really talking about the values of a 
dependent variable.
Types of data
Data come in four kinds. When you work with a variable, the way you work 
with it depends on what kind of data it is. 
The first variety is called nominal data. If a number is a piece of nominal data, 
it’s just a name. Its value doesn’t signify anything. A good example is the 
number on an athlete’s jersey. It’s just a way of identifying the athlete and 
distinguishing him or her from teammates. The number doesn’t indicate the 
athlete’s level of skill. 
Next comes ordinal data. Ordinal data are all about order, and numbers begin 
to take on meaning over and above just being identifiers. A higher number 
indicates the presence of more of a particular attribute than a lower number. 
One example is Moh’s Scale. Used since 1822, it’s a scale whose values are 1 
through 10. Mineralogists use this scale to rate the hardness of substances. 
Diamond, rated at 10, is the hardest. Talc, rated at 1, is the softest. A sub-
stance that has a given rating can scratch any substance that has a lower 
rating.
What’s missing from Moh’s Scale (and from all ordinal data) is the idea of 
equal intervals and equal differences. The difference between a hardness of 
10 and a hardness of 8 is not the same as the difference between a hardness 
of 6 and a hardness of 4.

13
 Chapter 1: Evaluating Data in the Real World
Interval data provides equal differences. Fahrenheit temperatures provide an 
example of interval data. The difference between 60 degrees and 70 degrees 
is the same as the difference between 80 degrees and 90 degrees.
Here’s something that might surprise you about Fahrenheit temperatures: 
A temperature of 100 degrees is not twice as hot as a temperature of 50 
degrees. For ratio statements (twice as much as, half as much as) to be valid, 
zero has to mean the complete absence of the attribute you’re measuring. A 
temperature of 0 degrees F doesn’t mean the absence of heat — it’s just an 
arbitrary point on the Fahrenheit scale.
The last data type, ratio data, includes a meaningful zero point. For tempera-
tures, the Kelvin scale gives us ratio data. One hundred degrees Kelvin is 
twice as hot as 50 degrees Kelvin. This is because the Kelvin zero point is 
absolute zero, where all molecular motion (the basis of heat) stops. Another 
example is a ruler. Eight inches is twice as long as four inches. A length of 
zero means a complete absence of length.
 
Any of these types can form the basis for an independent variable or a depen-
dent variable. The analytical tools you use depend on the type of data you’re 
dealing with.
A little probability
When statisticians make decisions, they express their confidence about those 
decisions in terms of probability. They can never be certain about what they 
decide. They can only tell you how probable their conclusions are.
So what is probability? The best way to attack this is with a few examples. 
If you toss a coin, what’s the probability that it comes up heads? Intuitively, 
you know that if the coin is fair, you have a 50-50 chance of heads and a 50-50 
chance of tails. In terms of the kinds of numbers associated with probability, 
that’s 1/2.
How about rolling a die? (One member of a pair of dice.) What’s the prob-
ability that you roll a 3? Hmmm . . . a die has six faces and one of them is 3, so 
that ought to be 1/6, right? Right.
Here’s one more. You have a standard deck of playing cards. You select one 
card at random. What’s the probability that it’s a club? Well . . . a deck of 
cards has four suits, so that answer is 1/4.
I think you’’re getting the picture. If you want to know the probability that an 
event occurs, figure out how many ways that event can happen and divide by 

14
Part I: Statistics and Excel: A Marriage Made in Heaven 
the total number of events that can happen. In each of the three examples, 
the event we were interested in (head, 3, or club) only happens one way. 
Things can get a bit more complicated. When you toss a die, what’s the prob-
ability you roll a 3 or a 4? Now you’re talking about two ways the event you’re 
interested in can occur, so that’s (1 + 1)/6 = 2/6 = 1/3. What about the probabil-
ity of rolling an even number? That has to be 2, 4, or 6, and the probability is 
(1 + 1 + 1)/6 = 3/6 = 1/2.
On to another kind of probability question. Suppose you roll a die and toss a 
coin at the same time. What’s the probability you roll a 3 and the coin comes 
up heads? Consider all the possible events that could occur when you roll a 
die and toss a coin at the same time. Your outcome could be a head and 1-6, 
or a tail and 1-6. That’s a total of 12 possibilities. The head-and-3 combination 
can only happen one way. So the answer is 1/12. 
In general the formula for the probability that a particular event occurs is
I began this section by saying that statisticians express their confidence 
about their decisions in terms of probability, which is really why I brought 
up this topic in the first place. This line of thinking leads us to conditional 
probability — the probability that an event occurs given that some other 
event occurs. For example, suppose I roll a die, take a look at it (so that you 
can’t see it), and I tell you that I’ve rolled an even number. What’s the prob-
ability that I’ve rolled a 2? Ordinarily, the probability of a 2 is 1/6, but I’ve 
narrowed the field. I’ve eliminated the three odd numbers (1, 3, and 5) as pos-
sibilities. In this case, only the three even numbers (2, 4, and 6) are possible, 
so now the probability of rolling a 2 is 1/3.
Exactly how does conditional probability plays into statistical analysis? 
Read on. 
Inferential Statistics: Testing Hypotheses
In advance of doing a study, a statistician draws up a tentative explanation — 
a hypothesis — as to why the data might come out a certain way. After the 
study is complete and the sample data are all tabulated, he or she faces the 
essential decision a statistician has to make — whether or not to reject the 
hypothesis. 

15
 Chapter 1: Evaluating Data in the Real World
That decision is wrapped in a conditional probability question — what’s 
the probability of obtaining the data, given that this hypothesis is correct? 
Statistical analysis provides tools to calculate the probability. If the probabil-
ity turns out to be low, the statistician rejects the hypothesis. 
Here’s an example. Suppose you’re interested in whether or not a particular 
coin is fair — whether it has an equal chance of coming up heads or tails. 
To study this issue, you’d take the coin and toss it a number of times — say 
a hundred. These 100 tosses make up your sample data. Starting from the 
hypothesis that the coin is fair, you’d expect that the data in your sample of 
100 tosses would show 50 heads and 50 tails. 
If it turns out to be 99 heads and 1 tail, you’d undoubtedly reject the fair coin 
hypothesis. Why? The conditional probability of getting 99 heads and 1 tail 
given a fair coin is very low. Wait a second. The coin could still be fair and 
you just happened to get a 99-1 split, right? Absolutely. In fact, you never 
really know. You have to gather the sample data (the results from 100 tosses) 
and make a decision. Your decision might be right, or it might not.
Juries face this all the time. They have to decide among competing hypoth-
eses that explain the evidence in a trial. (Think of the evidence as data.) One 
hypothesis is that the defendant is guilty. The other is that the defendant is 
not guilty. Jury-members have to consider the evidence and, in effect, answer 
a conditional probability question: What’s the probability of the evidence 
given that the defendant is not guilty? The answer to this question deter-
mines the verdict. 
Null and alternative hypotheses
Consider once again that coin-tossing study I just mentioned. The sample 
data are the results from the 100 tosses. Before tossing the coin, you might 
start with the hypothesis that the coin is a fair one, so that you expect an 
equal number of heads and tails. This starting point is called the null hypoth-
esis. The statistical notation for the null hypothesis is H 0. According to this 
hypothesis, any heads-tails split in the data is consistent with a fair coin. 
Think of it as the idea that nothing in the results of the study is out of the 
ordinary.
An alternative hypothesis is possible — that the coin isn’t a fair one, and it’s 
loaded to produce an unequal number of heads and tails. This hypothesis 
says that any heads-tails split is consistent with an unfair coin. The alterna-
tive hypothesis is called, believe it or not, the alternative hypothesis. The sta-
tistical notation for the alternative hypothesis is H1.

16
Part I: Statistics and Excel: A Marriage Made in Heaven 
With the hypotheses in place, toss the coin 100 times and note the number 
of heads and tails. If the results are something like 90 heads and 10 tails, it’s 
a good idea to reject H0. If the results are around 50 heads and 50 tails, don’t 
reject H 0. 
Similar ideas apply to the reading-speed example I gave earlier. One sample 
of children receives reading instruction under a new method designed to 
increase reading speed, the other learns via a traditional method. Measure 
the children’s reading speeds before and after instruction, and tabulate the 
improvement for each child. The null hypothesis, H 0, is that one method 
isn’t different from the other. If the improvements are greater with the new 
method than with the traditional method — so much greater that it’s unlikely 
that the methods aren’t different from one another — reject H 0. If they’re not, 
don’t reject H 0. 
 
Notice that I didn’t say “accept H0.” The way the logic works, you never accept 
a hypothesis. You either reject H0 or don’t reject H0. 
Notice also that in the coin-tossing example I said around 50 heads and 50 
tails. What does “around” mean? Also, I said if it’s 90-10, reject H0. What about 
85-15? 80-20? 70-30? Exactly how much different from 50-50 does the split 
have to be for you reject H0? In the reading-speed example, how much greater 
does the improvement have to be to reject H0? 
I won’t answer these questions now. Statisticians have formulated decision 
rules for situations like this, and we’ll explore those rules throughout the 
book.
Two types of error
Whenever you evaluate the data from a study and decide to reject H0 or to 
not reject H0, you can never be absolutely sure. You never really know what 
the true state of the world is. In the context of the coin-tossing example, that 
means you never know for certain if the coin is fair or not. All you can do is 
make a decision based on the sample data you gather. If you want to be cer-
tain about the coin, you’d have to have the data for the entire population of 
tosses — which means you’d have to keep tossing the coin until the end 
of time.
Because you’re never certain about your decisions, it’s possible to make an 
error regardless of what you decide. As I mentioned before, the coin could be 
fair and you just happen to get 99 heads in 100 tosses. That’s not likely, and 
that’s why you reject H0. It’s also possible that the coin is biased, and yet you 
just happen to toss 50 heads in 100 tosses. Again, that’s not likely and you 
don’t reject H0 in that case.

17
 Chapter 1: Evaluating Data in the Real World
Although not likely, those errors are possible. They lurk in every study that 
involves inferential statistics. Statisticians have named them Type I and 
Type II.
If you reject H0 and you shouldn’t, that’s a Type I error. In the coin example, 
that’s rejecting the hypothesis that the coin is fair, when in reality it is a fair 
coin.
If you don’t reject H0 and you should have, that’s a Type II error. That hap-
pens if you don’t reject the hypothesis that the coin is fair, and in reality it’s 
biased. 
How do you know if you’ve made either type of error? You don’t — at least 
not right after you make your decision to reject or not reject H0. (If it’s pos-
sible to know, you wouldn’t make the error in the first place!) All you can do 
is gather more data and see if the additional data are consistent with your 
decision.
If you think of H0 as a tendency to maintain the status quo and not interpret 
anything as being out of the ordinary (no matter how it looks), a Type II error 
means you missed out on something big. Looked at in that way, Type II errors 
form the basis of many historical ironies.
Here’s what I mean: In the 1950s, a particular TV show gave talented young 
entertainers a few minutes to perform on stage and a chance to compete for a 
prize. The audience voted to determine the winner. The producers held audi-
tions around the country to find people for the show. Many years after the 
show went off the air, the producer was interviewed. The interviewer asked 
him if he had ever turned down anyone at an audition that he shouldn’t have. 
“Well,” said the producer, “once a young singer auditioned for us and he 
seemed really odd.”
“In what way?” asked the interviewer.
“In a couple of ways,” said the producer. “He sang really loud, gyrated his 
body and his legs when he played the guitar, and he had these long side-
burns. We figured this kid would never make it in show business, so we 
thanked him for showing up, but we sent him on his way.”
“Wait a minute, are you telling me you turned down . . .”
“That’s right. We actually said ‘no’ . . . to Elvis Presley!”
Now that’s a Type II error.

What’s New in Excel?
The big news in Excel 2007 — throughout Microsoft Office 2007, in fact — is 
the user interface. Where a bar of menus once ruled, you now find a tabbed 
band. Appearing near the top of the worksheet window, this band is called 
the Ribbon. Figure 1-2 shows the appearance of the Ribbon after I select the 
Insert tab.
 
Figure 1-2: 
The Insert 
Tab in the 
Ribbon in 
Excel 2007.
 
The Ribbon exposes Excel’s capabilities in a way that’s much easier to under-
stand than in previous versions. Each tab presents groups of icon-labeled 
command buttons rather than menu choices. Mouseover help adds still 
more information when you’re trying to figure out the capability a particular 
button activates. 
Clicking a button typically opens up a whole category of possibilities. Buttons 
that do this are called category buttons. 
Microsoft has developed shorthand for describing a mouse-click on a com-
mand button in the Ribbon, and I use that shorthand throughout this book. 
The shorthand is 
Tab | Command Button
To indicate clicking on the Insert tab’s Other Charts category button, for 
example, I write
Insert | Other Charts
By the way, when I click that button, the gallery in Figure 1-3 appears. 
I can extend the shorthand. To select the first chart in that gallery (it’s called 
High-Low-Close, as mouseover help would tell you), I write
Insert | Other Charts | High-Low-Close

19
 Chapter 1: Evaluating Data in the Real World
 
Figure 1-3: 
Clicking 
Insert | 
Other Charts 
opens this 
gallery.
 
The downside to all this, of course, is the Ribbon’s newness. If you’ve spent 
years with previous versions, you’ve developed an overall sense of where fre-
quently used capabilities reside. Now you have to reorient: The switch from 
the menu bar to the Ribbon relocates almost everything.
It’s worth your while to reorient. After you get accustomed to the Ribbon, 
you’ll see that everything takes just a few steps now.
Wait a second. Figure 1-3 shows a gallery of charts to insert into a worksheet. 
What happened to the Chart Wizard? It’s gone from Excel 2007. In keeping 
with everything-takes-just-a-few-steps-now, to create a chart you
 
1. Select the data to include in the chart.
 
2. Insert the chart into the worksheet.
 
3. Use the Design tab and the Layout tab to make modifications.
I’ve oversimplified, but not by much, as Chapter 3 shows. Creating a chart is 
more intuitive than it used to be. You’re no longer confined to the order of 
steps specified in the Chart Wizard.
Wait another second. Design tab? Layout tab? They’re not in Figure 1-2. After 
you insert a chart and select it, they appear. Tabs that appear when needed 
are called contextual tabs.
Also in keeping with everything-takes-just-a-few-steps-now, to use a statistical 
function you
 
1. Select a cell for the result of the function.

20
Part I: Statistics and Excel: A Marriage Made in Heaven 
 
2. Select a function from the Statistical Functions menu to open a dialog 
box for that function.
 
3. Enter the required information into the dialog box.
 
4. Close the dialog box.
Again I’ve oversimplified, and again not by much, as you see throughout 
the book.
Statistical Functions menu? Yep. This time around, you have a Statistical 
Functions menu that wasn’t in the earlier incarnations. It’s buried under 
Formulas | More Functions | Statistical
In Chapter 2 I show you how to make that menu more accessible.
Excel 2007’s statistical functionality is by and large the same as in previous 
versions. The new version adds three statistical functions: COUNTIFS (counts 
the number of cells that meet a set of conditions), AVERAGEIF (finds the aver-
age of cells that meet a condition), AVERAGEIFS (finds the average of cells 
that meet a set of conditions).
Some Things about Excel You 
Absolutely Have to Know
Although I’m assuming you’re not new to Excel, I think it’s wise to take a 
little time and space up front to discuss a few Excel fundamentals that figure 
prominently in statistical work. Knowing these fundamentals helps you work 
efficiently with Excel formulas.
Autofilling cells
The first is autofill, Excel’s capability for repeating a calculation throughout 
a worksheet. Insert a formula into a cell, and you can drag that formula into 
adjoining cells. 
Figure 1-4 is a worksheet of expenditures for R&D in science and engineer-
ing at colleges and universities for the years shown. The data, taken from a 
U.S. National Science Foundation report, are in millions of dollars. Column H 
holds the total for each field, and row 11 holds the total for each year. (More 
about column I in a moment.)

21
 Chapter 1: Evaluating Data in the Real World
 
Figure 1-4: 
Expenditures 
for R&D in 
science and 
engineering.
 
I started with column H blank and with row 11 blank. How did I get the totals 
into column H and row 11?
If I want to create a formula to calculate the first row total (for Physical 
Sciences), one way (among several) is to enter
= D2 + E2 + F2 + G2
into cell H2. (A formula always begins with “=”.) Press Enter and the total 
appears in H2.
Now, to put that formula into cells H3 through H10, the trick is to position the 
cursor on the lower right corner of H2 until a “+” appears, hold down the left 
mouse button, and drag the mouse through the cells. That “+” is called the 
cell’s fill handle.
When you finish dragging, release the mouse button and the row totals 
appear. This saves huge amounts of time, because you don’t have to reenter 
the formula eight times.
Same thing with the column totals. One way to create the formula that sums 
up the numbers in the first column (1990) is to enter
=D2 + D3 + D4 + D5 + D6 + D7 + D8 + D9 + D10
into cell D11. Position the cursor on D11’s fill handle, drag through row 11 
and release in column H, and you autofill the totals into E11 through H11.

22
Part I: Statistics and Excel: A Marriage Made in Heaven 
Dragging isn’t the only way to do it. Another way is to select the array of cells 
you want to autofill (including the one that contains the formula), and click 
the down arrow next to 
Home | Fill
This opens the Fill pop-up menu (see Figure 1-5). Select Down and you 
accomplish the same thing as dragging and dropping. 
 
Figure 1-5: 
The Fill 
pop-up 
menu.
 
Still another way is to select Series from the Fill pop-up menu. Doing this 
opens the Series dialog box (see Figure 1-6). In this dialog box, click the 
AutoFill radio button, click OK, and you’re all set. This does take one more 
step, but the Series dialog box is a bit more compatible with earlier versions 
of Excel.
 
Figure 1-6: 
The Series 
dialog box.
 
I bring this up because statistical analysis often involves repeating a formula 
from cell to cell. The formulas are usually more complex than the ones in this 
section, and you might have to repeat them many times, so it pays to know 
how to autofill.
Referencing cells
The second important fundamental is the way Excel references worksheet 
cells. Consider again the worksheet in Figure 1-4. Each autofilled formula is 
slightly different from the original. This, remember, is the formula in cell H2:

23
 Chapter 1: Evaluating Data in the Real World
= D2 + E2 + F2 + G2
After autofill, the formula in H3 is
= D3 + E3 + F3 + G3
and the formula in H4 is . . . well, you get the picture.
This is perfectly appropriate. I want the total in each row, so Excel adjusts 
the formula accordingly as it automatically inserts it into each cell. This is 
called relative referencing — the reference (the cell label) gets adjusted rela-
tive to where it is in the worksheet. Here, the formula directs Excel to total up 
the numbers in the cells in the four columns immediately to the left.
Now for another possibility. Suppose I want to know each row total’s propor-
tion of the grand total (the number in H11). That should be straightforward, 
right? Create a formula for I2, and then autofill cells I3 through I10.
Similar to the earlier example, I’d start by entering this formula into I2:
=H2/H11
Press Enter and the proportion appears in I2. Position the cursor on the fill 
handle, drag through column I, release in I10, and . . . D’oh!!! Figure 1-7 shows 
the unhappy result — the extremely ugly #/DIV0! in I3 through I10. What’s the 
story?
 
Figure 1-7: 
Whoops! 
Incorrect 
autofill!
 

24
Part I: Statistics and Excel: A Marriage Made in Heaven 
The story is this: unless you tell it not to, Excel uses relative referencing 
when you autofill. So the formula inserted into I3 is not 
=H3/H11
Instead, it’s
=H3/H12
Why does H11 become H12? Relative referencing assumes that the formula 
means divide the number in the cell by whatever number is nine cells south 
of here in the same column. Because H12 has nothing in it, the formula is tell-
ing Excel to divide by zero, which is a no-no. 
The idea is to tell Excel to divide all the numbers by the number in H11, not 
by whatever number is nine cells south of here. To do this, you work with 
absolute referencing. You show absolute referencing by adding $-signs to the 
cell ID. The correct formula for I2 is
= H2/$H$11
This tells Excel not to adjust the column and not to adjust the row when you 
autofill. Figure 1-8 shows the worksheet with the proportions. 
 
Figure 1-8: 
Autofill 
based on 
absolute 
referencing.
 
 
To convert a relative reference into absolute reference format, select the 
cell address (or addresses) you want to convert, and press the F4 key. F4 is 
a toggle that goes between relative reference (H11, for example), absolute 

25
 Chapter 1: Evaluating Data in the Real World
reference for both the row and column in the address ($H$11), absolute refer-
ence for the row-part only (H$11), and absolute reference for the column-part 
only ($H11).
What’s New in This Edition?
Although Excel’s statistical functions haven’t changed, I’ve restructured the 
instructions for every statistical function. The instructions in this edition fit 
in with the steps I outlined in the preceding section.
With the disappearance of the Chart Wizard I’ve restructured the instruc-
tions for creating a chart, too. (See Chapter 3.)
One of my points in both editions is that when you report an average, you 
should also report variability. For this reason I believe Excel 2007 should also 
offer the functions STDEVIF and STDEVIFS in addition to the new functions 
AVERAGEIF and AVERAGEIFS. Unfortunately, these functions do not exist in 
Excel 2007. To fill the void, I show you how to do what these functions would 
do, and in the process take you through some of Excel’s Logical Functions. 
(See Chapter 5.)
It’s easier to assign a name to a cell range in Excel 2007 (it takes . . . you 
guessed it . . . just-a-few-steps-now). So I rely much more on named cell 
ranges in this edition. (See Chapter 2.)
In the Part of Tens, I’ve added a section on importing data from the Web. (See 
Chapter 20.)
I pointed out in the Introduction that I’ve added Appendix B and Appendix C. 
Each one shows how to do some nifty statistical work that doesn’t come pre-
packaged in Excel.

I
n this chapter, I introduce you to Excel’s statistical functions and data 
analysis tools. If you’ve used Excel, and I’m assuming you have, you’re 
aware of Excel’s extensive functionality, of which statistical capabilities are a 
subset. Into each worksheet cell you can enter a piece of data, instruct Excel 
to carry out calculations on data that reside in a set of cells, or use one of 
Excel’s worksheet functions to work on data. Each worksheet function is a 
built-in formula that saves you the trouble of having to direct Excel to per-
form a sequence of calculations. As newbies and veterans know, formulas are 
the business end of Excel. The data analysis tools go beyond the formulas. 
Each tool provides a set of informative results.
Getting Started 
Many of Excel’s statistical features are built into its worksheet functions. In 
previous versions, you accessed the worksheet functions by using the Excel 
Insert Function button, labeled with the symbol fx. Clicking this button opens 
the Insert Function dialog box, which presents a list of Excel’s functions and 
a capability for searching for Excel functions. Although Excel 2007 provides 

28
Part I: Statistics and Excel: A Marriage Made in Heaven 
easier ways to access the worksheet functions, this latest version preserves 
this button and offers additional ways to open the Insert Function dialog box. 
I discuss all of this in more detail in a moment.
Figure 2-1 shows the location of the Insert Function button and the Formula 
Bar. They’re on the right of the Name Box. All three are just below the 
Ribbon. Inside the Ribbon, in the Formulas tab, is the Function Library.
The Formula Bar is like a clone of a cell you select: Information entered into 
the Formula Bar goes into the selected cell, and information entered in the 
selected cell appears in the Formula Bar. 
Figure 2-1 shows Excel with the Formulas tab open. This shows you another 
location for the Insert Function button. Labeled fx, it’s in the extreme left 
of the Ribbon, in the Function Library area. As I mention earlier in this sec-
tion, when you click the Insert Function button, you open the Insert Function 
dialog box. (See Figure 2-2.)

Figure 2-2: 
The Insert

dialog box.
 
This dialog box enables you to search for a function that fits your needs, or 
to scroll through a list of Excel functions.
So in addition to clicking the Insert Function button next to the Formula bar, 
you can open the Insert Function dialog box by selecting
Formulas | Insert Function
 
To open the Insert Function dialog box, you can also press Shift+F3.
Because of the way earlier versions of Excel were organized, the Insert 
Function dialog box was extremely useful. In Excel 2007, however, it’s mostly 
helpful if you’re not sure which function to use or where to find it. 
The Function Library presents the categories of formulas you can use and 
makes it convenient for you to access them. Clicking a category button in this 
area opens a menu of the functions in that category.
Most of the time, I work with Statistical Functions that are easily accessible 
through the Statistical Functions menu. Sometimes I work with Math functions 
in the Math & Trig Functions menu. (You see a couple of these later in the 
chapter.) In Chapter 5, I work with a couple of Logic functions.
 
The final selection of each category menu (like the Statistical Functions menu) 
is called Insert Function. Selecting this option is still another way to open the 
Insert Function dialog box.
The Name Box is something like a running record of what you do in the work-
sheet. Select a cell, and the cell’s address appears in the Name Box. Click 
the Insert Function button and the name of the function you selected most 
recently appears in the Name Box.

30
Part I: Statistics and Excel: A Marriage Made in Heaven 
In addition to the statistical functions, Excel provides a number of data analy-
sis tools you access through the Data tab’s Analysis area. 
Setting Up for Statistics
In this section, I show you how to use the worksheet functions and the analy-
sis tools.
Worksheet functions in Excel 2007
Because the Ribbon exposes so many of Excel’s capabilities, it’s not neces-
sary to bury them in menus any more. As I point out in the preceding section, 
the Function Library area of the Formulas tab shows all the categories of 
worksheet functions.
The steps in using a worksheet function are:
 
1. Type your data into a data array and select a cell for the result.
 
2. Select the appropriate formula category and choose your function 
from its pop-up menu. 
 
 Doing this opens the Function Arguments dialog box.
 
3. In the Function Arguments dialog box, type the appropriate values for 
the function’s arguments.
 
 Argument is a term from mathematics. It has nothing to do with debates, 
fights, or confrontations. In mathematics, an argument is a value on 
which a function does its work.
 
4. Click OK to put the result into the selected cell.
Yes, that’s all there is to it.
To give you an example, I explore a function that typifies how Excel’s work-
sheet functions work. This function, SUM, adds up the numbers in cells you 
specify and returns the sum in still another cell that you specify. Although 
adding numbers together is an integral part of statistical number crunching, 
SUM is not in the Statistical category. It is, however, a typical worksheet func-
tion and it shows a familiar operation. 
Here, step by step, is how to use SUM.

31
 Chapter 2: Understanding Excel’s Statistical Capabilities
 
1. Enter your numbers into an array of cells and select a cell for the 
result. 
 
 In this example, I’ve entered 45, 33, 18, 37, 32, 46, 39 into cells C2 
through C8, and selected C9 to hold the sum.
 
2. Select the appropriate formula category and choose your function 
from its pop-up menu. 
 
 This opens the Function Arguments dialog box.
 
 I selected Formulas | Math & Trig
 
 and scrolled down to find and choose SUM.
 
3. In the Function Arguments dialog box, enter the appropriate values 
for the arguments. 
 
 Excel guesses that you want to sum the numbers in cells C2 through C8 
and identifies that array in the Number1 box. Excel doesn’t keep you in 
suspense: The Function Arguments dialog box shows the result of apply-
ing the function. In this example, the sum of the numbers in the array is 
250. (See Figure 2-3.) 
 
4. Click OK to put the sum into the selected cell.
 
Figure 2-3: 
Using SUM.
 

32
Part I: Statistics and Excel: A Marriage Made in Heaven 
Note a couple of points. First, as Figure 2-3 shows, the Formula Bar holds
=SUM(C2:C8)
This formula indicates that the value in the selected cell equals the sum of 
the numbers in cells C2 through C8.
 
After you get familiar with a worksheet function and its arguments, you can 
bypass the menu and type the function directly into the cell or into the for-
mula bar, beginning with “=”. When you do, Excel opens a helpful menu as you 
type the formula. (See Figure 2-4.) The menu shows possible formulas begin-
ning with the letter(s) you type, and you can select one by double-clicking it.
 
Figure 2-4: 
As you type 
a formula, 
Excel opens 
a helpful 
menu.
 
Another noteworthy point is the set of boxes in the Function Arguments 
dialog box in Figure 2-3. In the figure you see just two boxes, Number1 and 
Number2. The data array appears in Number1. So what’s Number2 for?
The Number2 box allows you to include an additional argument in the sum. 
And it doesn’t end there. Click in the Number2 box and the Number3 box 
appears. Click in the Number3 box, and the Number4 box appears . . . and on 
and on. The limit is 255 boxes, with each box corresponding to an argument. 
A value can be another array of cells anywhere in the worksheet, a number, 
an arithmetic expression that evaluates to a number, a cell ID, or a name 
that you have attached to a range of cells. (Regarding that last one: Read the 
upcoming section “What’s in a name? An array of possibilities.”) As you type 
in values, the SUM dialog box shows the updated sum. Clicking OK puts the 
updated sum into the selected cell.
 
You won’t find this multiargument capability on every worksheet function. 
Some are designed to work with just one argument. For the ones that do work 
with multiple arguments, however, you can incorporate data that resides all 
over the worksheet. Figure 2-5 shows a worksheet with a Function Arguments 
dialog box that includes data from two arrays of cells, two arithmetic expres-
sions, and one cell. Notice the format of the function in the Formula Bar 
(a comma separates successive arguments).

33
 Chapter 2: Understanding Excel’s Statistical Capabilities
 
Figure 2-5: 
Using SUM 
with five 
arguments.
 
 
If you select a cell in the same column as your data and just below the last 
data cell, Excel correctly guesses the data array that you want to work on. 
Excel doesn’t always guess what you want to do, however. Sometimes when 
Excel does guess, its guess is incorrect. When either of those things happens, 
it’s up to you to enter the appropriate values into the Function Arguments 
dialog box.
Quickly accessing statistical functions
In the preceding example, I show you a function that’s not in the category of 
statistical functions. In this section, I show you how to create a shortcut to 
Excel’s statistical functions.
You can get to Excel’s statistical functions by selecting 
Formulas | More Functions | Statistical 
and then choosing from the resulting pop-up menu. (See Figure 2-6.)

34
Part I: Statistics and Excel: A Marriage Made in Heaven 
 
Figure 2-6: 
Accessing 
Excel’s 
Statistical 
Functions.
 
Although Excel has buried the statistical functions several layers deep, you 
can use a handy Excel 2007 technique to make them as accessible as any of 
the other categories: You add them to the Quick Access Toolbar in the upper-
left corner. (Every Office 2007 application has one.)
To do this, select 
Formulas | More Functions 
and right-click on Statistical. On the pop-up menu, pick the first option; Add 
to Quick Access Toolbar. (See Figure 2-7.) Doing this adds a button to the 
Quick Access Toolbar. Clicking the new button’s down arrow opens the 
pop-up menu of statistical functions. (See Figure 2-8.) 
 
Figure 2-7: 
Adding the 
Statistical 
functions to 
the Quick 
Access 
Toolbar.
 

35
 Chapter 2: Understanding Excel’s Statistical Capabilities
 
Figure 2-8: 
The 
Statistical 
Functions 
menu.
 
From now on, when I deal with a statistical function, I assume that you’ve cre-
ated this shortcut, so you can quickly open the menu of statistical functions. 
The next section provides an example.
Array functions
Most of Excel’s built-in functions are formulas that calculate a single value 
(like a sum) and put that value into a worksheet cell. Excel has another type 
of function. It’s called an array function because it calculates multiple values 
and puts those values into an array of cells, rather than into a single cell.
FREQUENCY is a good example of an array function (and it’s an Excel statisti-
cal function, too). Its job is to summarize a group of scores by showing how 
the scores fall into a set of intervals that you specify. For example, given 
these scores
77, 45, 44, 61, 52, 53, 68, 55
and these intervals
50, 60, 70, 80

36
Part I: Statistics and Excel: A Marriage Made in Heaven 
FREQUENCY shows how many are less than or equal to 50 (2 in this exam-
ple), how many are greater than 50 and less than or equal to 60 (that would 
be 3), and so on. The number of scores in each interval is called a frequency. 
A table of the intervals and the frequencies is called a frequency distribution. 
Here’s an example of how to use FREQUENCY:
 
1. Enter the scores into an array of cells.
 
 Figure 2-9 shows a group of scores in cells B2 through B16. 
 
2. Enter the intervals into an array.
 
 I’ve put the intervals in C2 through C9. 
 
3. Select an array for the frequencies. 
 
 I’ve put Frequency as the label at the top of column D, so I select D2 
through D10 for the resulting frequencies. Why the extra cell? FREQUENCY 
returns a vertical array that has one more cell than the frequencies array.
 
4. From the Statistical Functions menu, select FREQUENCY to open the 
Function Arguments dialog box.
 
 I used the shortcut I installed on the Quick Access Toolbar to open this 
menu and select FREQUENCY.
 
Figure 2-9: 
Working 
with 
FREQUENCY.
 

37
 Chapter 2: Understanding Excel’s Statistical Capabilities
 
5. In the Function Arguments dialog box, enter the appropriate values 
for the arguments.
 
 I begin with the Data_array box. In this box I entered the cells that hold 
the scores. In this example, that’s B2:B16. I’m assuming you know Excel 
well enough to know how to do this in several ways. 
 
 Next, I identify the intervals array. FREQUENCY refers to intervals as 
“bins,” and holds the intervals in the Bins_array box. For this example, 
C2:C9 goes into the Bins_array box. After identifying both arrays, the Insert 
Function dialog box shows the frequencies inside a pair of curly brackets.
 
6. Press Ctrl+Shift+Enter to Close the Function Arguments dialog box 
and put the values in the selected array.
 
 This is VERY important. Because the dialog box has an OK button, the 
tendency is to click OK, thinking that puts the results into the work-
sheet. That doesn’t get the job done when you work with an array func-
tion, however. Always use the keystroke combination Ctrl+Shift+Enter to 
close the Function Arguments dialog box for an array function.
After closing the Function Arguments dialog box, the frequencies go into the 
appropriate cells, as Figure 2-10 shows.
 
Figure 2-10: 
The finished 
frequencies.
 
Note the formula in the Formula Bar:
{= FREQUENCY(B2:B16,C2:C9)}
The curly brackets are Excel’s way of telling you that this is an array function.
 
I’m not one to repeat myself, but in this case I’ll make an exception. As I said in 
Step 6, press Ctrl+Shift+Enter whenever you work with an array function. Keep 
this in mind because the Arguments Function dialog box doesn’t provide any 
reminders. If you click OK after you enter your arguments into an array func-
tion, you’ll be very frustrated. Trust me.

38
Part I: Statistics and Excel: A Marriage Made in Heaven 
What’s in a name? An array 
of possibilities
As you get more into Excel’s statistical features, you work increasingly with 
formulas that have multiple arguments. Oftentimes, these arguments refer to 
arrays of cells, as in the preceding examples. 
If you apply meaningful names to these arrays, it helps you keep straight 
what you’re doing. Also, if you come back to a worksheet after being away 
from it for a while, meaningful array names can help you quickly get back into 
the swing of things. Another benefit: If you have to explain your worksheet 
and its formulas to others, meaningful array names are tremendously helpful.
Excel gives you an easy way to attach a name to a group of cells. In Figure 2-11, 
column C is named Revenue_Millions, indicating “Revenue in millions of dol-
lars.” As it stands, that just makes it a bit easier to read the column. If I explicitly 
tell Excel to treat Revenue_Millions as the name of the array of cells C2 through 
C13, however, I can use Revenue_Millions whenever I refer to that array of cells.
 
Figure 2-11: 
Defining 
names for 
arrays of 
cells.
 
Why did I use Revenue_Millions and not Revenue (Millions) or Revenue In 
Millions or Revenue: Millions? Excel doesn’t like blank spaces or symbols 
in its names. In fact, here are four rules to follow when you supply a name 
for a range of cells:
 
✓ Begin a name with an alphabetic character — a letter rather than a 
number or a punctuation mark.
 
✓ As I just mentioned, make sure that the name contains no spaces or sym-
bols. Use an underscore to denote a space between words in the name.

✓ Be sure that the name is unique within the worksheet.
 
✓ Be sure that the name doesn’t duplicate any cell reference in the 
 worksheet.
Here’s how to define a name:
 
1. Put a descriptive name at the top of a column (or to the left of a row) 
you want to name.
 
 Figure 2-10 shows this.
 
2. Select the range of cells you want to name. 
 
 For this example, that’s cells C2 through C13. Why not include C1? I 
explain in a second.
 
3. Right-click on the selected range.
 
 This opens the menu shown in Figure 2-12. 
 
Figure 2-12: 
Right-
clicking a 
selected 
cell range 
opens this 
pop-up 
menu.
 
 
4. From the pop-up menu, select Name a Range.
 
 This selection opens the New Name dialog box (see Figure 2-13). As you 
can see, Excel knows that Revenue_Millions is the name for the array, 
and that Revenue_Millions refers to cells C2 through C13. When pre-
sented with a selected range of cells to name, Excel looks for a nearby 
name — just above a column or just to the left of a row. If no name is 
present, you get to supply one in the New Name dialog box. (The New 
Name dialog box is also accessible by choosing Formula | Define Name.)

Figure 2-13: 
The New 
Name dialog 
box.
 
 
 When you select a range of cells like a column with a name at the top, 
you can include the cell with the name in it and Excel attaches the 
name to the range. I strongly advise against doing this. Why? If I select C1 
through C13, the name Revenue_Millions refers to cells C1 through C13, 
not C2 through C13. In that case, the first value in the range is text and 
the others are numbers. 
 
 For a formula like SUM (or SUMIF or SUMIFS, which I discuss next), this 
doesn’t make a difference: In those formulas, Excel just ignores values 
that aren’t numbers. If you have to use the whole array in a calculation, 
however, it makes a huge difference: Excel thinks the name is part of the 
array and tries to use it in the calculation. You’ll see this in the next sec-
tion on creating your own array formulas.
 
5. Click OK.
 
 Excel attaches the name to the range of cells.
Now I have the convenience of using the name in a formula. Here, selecting 
a cell (like C14) and entering the SUM formula directly into C14 opens the 
boxes in Figure 2-14. 
 
Figure 2-14: 
Entering 
a formula 
directly into 
a cell opens 
these boxes.
 

41
 Chapter 2: Understanding Excel’s Statistical Capabilities
As the figure shows, the boxes open as I type. Pressing the Tab key fills in the 
formula in a way that Excel understands. I have to supply the close parenthe-
sis (see Figure 2-15) and type Enter to see the result.
Using the named array, then, the formula is 
=SUM(Revenue_Millions)
which is more descriptive than
=SUM(C2:C13)
A couple of Excel 2007’s new formulas show just how convenient this naming 
capability is. These formulas, SUMIF and SUMIFS, add a set of numbers if 
specific conditions in one cell range (SUMIF) or in more than one cell range 
(SUMIFS) are met. SUMIFS is new in Excel 2007.
To take full advantage of naming, I name both column A (Year) and column B 
(Region) in the same way I named column C. 
 
Figure 2-15: 
Completing 
the formula.

When you define a name for a cell range like B2:B13 in this example, beware: 
Excel can be a bit quirky when the cells hold names. Excel might guess that 
the name in the uppermost cell is the name you want to assign to the cell 
range. In this case, Excel guesses “North” for the name, rather than “Region.” 
If that happens, you make the change in the New Name dialog box.
To keep track of the names in a worksheet, selecting 
Formula | Name Manager 
opens the Name Manager box shown in Figure 2-16. The nearby buttons in 
the Defined Names area are also useful.
 
Figure 2-16: 
Managing 
the Defined 
Names in a 
worksheet.
 
Next, I sum the data in column C, but only for the North Region. That is, I only 
consider a cell in column C if the corresponding cell in column B contains 
“North.” To do this, I followed these steps:
 
1. Select a cell for the formula result.
 
 My selection here is C15.
 
2. Select the appropriate formula category and choose your function 
from its pop-up menu. 
 
 This opens the Function Arguments dialog box.
 
 I selected Formulas | Math & Trig
 
 and scrolled down the menu to find and choose SUMIF. This selection 
opens the Function Arguments dialog box shown in Figure 2-17. 

43
 Chapter 2: Understanding Excel’s Statistical Capabilities
 
Figure 2-17: 
The 
Function 
Arguments 
dialog box 
for SUMIF.
 
 
 SUMIF has three arguments. The first, Range, is the range of cells to eval-
uate for the condition to include in the sum (North, South, East, or West 
in this example). The second, Criteria, is the specific value in the Range 
(North, for this example). The third, Sum_range, holds the values I sum.
 
3. In the Function Arguments dialog box, enter the appropriate values 
for the arguments.
 
 Here’s where another Defined Names button comes in handy. In that 
Ribbon area, click the down arrow next to Use in Formula to open the 
drop-down list shown in Figure 2-18. 
 
Figure 2-18: 
The Use 
In Formula 
drop-down 
list.
 

44
Part I: Statistics and Excel: A Marriage Made in Heaven 
 
 Selecting from this list fills in the Function Arguments dialog box, as 
shown in Figure 2-19. I had to type North into the Criteria box. Excel 
adds the double quotes.
 
4. Click OK.
 
 The result appears in the selected cell. For this example, that’s 78.
 
Figure 2-19: 
Completing 
the Function 
Arguments 
dialog box 
for SUMIF.
 
In the formula bar, 
=SUMIF(Region,”North”, Revenue_Millions) 
appears. I can type it exactly that way into the formula bar, without the 
dialog box or the drop-down list. 
The formula in the formula bar is easier to understand than
= SUMIF(B2:B13,”North”, C2:C13)
isn’t it?
Incidentally, the same cell range can be both the Range and the Sum_range. 
For example, to sum just the cells for which Revenue_Millions is less than 25, 
that’s
=SUMIF(Revenue_Millions, “< 25”, Revenue_Millions)
The second argument (Criteria) is always in double-quotes.
What about SUMIFS? That one is useful if I want to find the sum of revenues 
for North but only for the years 2006 and 2007. Follow these steps to use 
SUMIFS to find this sum:

45
 Chapter 2: Understanding Excel’s Statistical Capabilities
 
1. Select a cell for the formula result.
 
 The selected cell is C17.
 
2. Select the appropriate formula category and choose your function 
from its pop-up menu. 
 
 This opens the Function Arguments dialog box.
 
 For this example, the selection is SUMIFS from the 
 
 Formulas | Math & Trig
 
 menu, opening the Functions Arguments dialog box shown in Figure 2-20.
 
3.  In the Function Arguments dialog box, enter the appropriate values 
for the arguments.
 
 Notice that in SUMIFS the Sum_range argument appears first. In SUMIF, 
it appears last. The appropriate values for the arguments appear in 
Figure 2-20.
 
4. The formula in the Formula bar is
=SUMIFS(Revenue_Millions,Year,”<2008”,Region,”North”)
 
5. Click OK.
 
 The answer, 46, appears in the selected cell.
With unnamed arrays, the formula would have been
=SUMIFS(C2:C13,A2:A13,”<2008”,B2:B13,”North”)
which seems much harder to comprehend.

46

A defined name involves absolute referencing. (See Chapter 1.) Therefore, if 
you try to autofill from a named array, you’ll be in for an unpleasant surprise: 
Rather than autofilling a group of cells, you’ll be copying a value over and over 
again.
Here’s what I mean. Suppose you assign the name Series_1 to A2:A11 and 
Series_2 to B2:B11. In A12, you calculate SUM(Series_1). Being clever, you 
figure you’ll just drag the result from A12 to B12 to calculate SUM(Series_2). 
What do you find in B12? SUM(Series_1), that’s what.
Creating your own array formulas 
In addition to Excel’s built-in array formulas, you can create your own. To 
help things along, you can incorporate named arrays.
Figure 2-21 shows two named arrays, X and Y in columns C and D. X refers 
to C2 through C5 (not C1 through C5!) and Y refers to D2 through D5 (not D1 
through D5!) XY is the column header for column F. Each cell in column F will 
store the product of the corresponding cell in column C and the correspond-
ing cell in column D.
 
Figure 2-21: 
Two named 
arrays.
 
An easy way to enter the products, of course, is to just set F2 equal to C2*E2 
and then autofill the remaining applicable cells in column F.
Just to illustrate array formulas, though, I follow these steps to work on the 
data in the worksheet in Figure 2-21.
 
1. Select the array that will hold the answers to the array formula.
 
 That would be F2 through F5, or F2:F5 in Excel-speak. Figure 2-21 shows 
the array selected.
 
2. Into the selected array, type the formula.
 
 The formula here is =X * Y

47
 Chapter 2: Understanding Excel’s Statistical Capabilities
 
3. Press Ctrl+Shift+Enter (not Enter).
 
 The answers appear in F2 through F5, as Figure 2-22 shows. Note the for-
mula {=X*Y} 
 
 in the formula bar. As I told you earlier, the curly brackets indicate an 
array formula.
 
Figure 2-22: 
The results 
of the array 
formula 
{=X * Y}.
 
Another thing I mention earlier in this chapter: When you name a range of 
cells, make sure that the named range does not include the cell with the name 
in it. If it does, an array formula like {=X * Y} tries to multiply the letter X by 
the letter Y to produce the first value, which is impossible and results in the 
exceptionally ugly #VALUE! error. 
Using data analysis tools
Excel has a set of sophisticated tools for data analysis. Table 2-1 lists the 
tools I cover. (The one I don’t cover, Fourier Analysis, is extremely techni-
cal.) Some of the terms in the table may be unfamiliar to you, but you’ll know 
them by the time you finish this book.

49
 Chapter 2: Understanding Excel’s Statistical Capabilities
To start, click the Office Button and select Excel Options. Doing this opens 
the Excel Options dialog box. Then follow these steps:
 
1. In the Excel Options dialog box, select Add-Ins. 
 
 Oddly enough, this opens a list of add-ins. 
 
2. Near the bottom of the list, you see a drop-down list labeled Manage. 
From this list, select Excel Add-Ins. 
 
3. Click Go. 
 
 This opens the Add-Ins dialog box. (See Figure 2-23.) 
 
4. Click the check box next to Analysis Toolpak and then click OK.
 
Figure 2-23: 
The Add-Ins 
dialog box.
 
When Excel finishes loading the Toolpak, you’ll find a Data Analysis button in 
the Analysis area of the Data tab. In general, the steps for using a data analy-
sis tool are:
 
1. Enter your data into an array.
 
2. Click Data | Data Analysis to open the Data Analysis dialog box.
 
3. In the Data Analysis dialog box select the data analysis tool you want 
to work with.
 
4. Click OK (or just double-click the selection) to open the dialog box for 
the selected tool.
 
5. In the tool’s dialog box, enter the appropriate information. 
 
 I know this sounds like a cop-out, but each tool is different.
 
6. Click OK to close the dialog box and see the results.

50
Part I: Statistics and Excel: A Marriage Made in Heaven 
Here’s an example to get you accustomed to using these tools. In this exam-
ple, I go through the Descriptive Statistics tool. This tool calculates a number 
of statistics that summarize a set of scores.
 
1. Enter your data into an array.
 
 Figure 2-24 shows an array of numbers in cells B2 through B9, with a 
column header in B1.
 
2. Click Data | Data Analysis to open the Data Analysis dialog box.
 
3. Click Descriptive Statistics and click OK (or just double-click 
Descriptive Statistics) to open the Descriptive Statistics dialog box. 
 
4. Identify the data array.
 
 In the Input Range box, enter the cells that hold the data. For this 
example, that’s B1 through B9. The easiest way to do this is to move 
the cursor to the top cell (B1), press the Shift key, and click the bottom 
cell (B9). That puts the absolute reference format $B$1:$B$9 into Input 
Range.
 
5. Click the Columns radio button to indicate that the data are organized 
by columns.
 
6. Check the Labels in First Row checkbox, because the Input Range 
includes the column heading.
 
7. Click the New Worksheet Ply radio button, if it isn’t already selected.
 
 This tells Excel to create a new tabbed sheet within the current work-
sheet, and to send the results to the newly created sheet.
 
Figure 2-24: 
Working 
with the 
Descriptive 
Statistics

51
 Chapter 2: Understanding Excel’s Statistical Capabilities
 
8. Click the Summary Statistics checkbox and leave the others 
unchecked. Click OK.
 
 The new tabbed sheet (ply) opens, displaying statistics that summarize 
the data. Figure 2-25 shows the new ply, after I widened Column A.
 
Figure 2-25: 
The out-
put of the 
Descriptive

tool.
 
For now, I won’t tell you the meaning of each individual statistic in the 
Summary Statistics display. I leave that for Chapter 7 when I delve more 
deeply into descriptive statistics. 
Accessing Commonly Used Functions
Need quick access to a few commonly used Statistical functions? You can get 
to AVERAGE, MIN (minimum value in a selected cell range), and MAX (maxi-
mum value in a selected range) by clicking the down arrow next to a button 
on the Home tab. Clicking this down arrow also gets you to the Mathematical 
functions SUM and COUNT NUMBERS (counts the numerical values in a cell 
range).
For some reason, this button is in the Editing area. It’s labeled Σ. Figure 2-26 
shows you exactly where it is and the menu its down arrow opens. 
By the way, if you just click the button
Home | Σ
and not the down arrow, you get SUM.
The last selection on that menu is yet another way to open the Insert 
Function dialog box.

52
Part I: Statistics and Excel: A Marriage Made in Heaven 
 
Figure 2-26: 
The Home 
| Σ button 
and the 
menu its 
down arrow 
opens.
 
 
One nice thing about using this menu — it eliminates a step: When you select 
a function, you don’t have to select a cell for the result. Just select the cell 
range and the function inserts the value in a cell immediately after the range.

Part II
Describing Data

In this part . . . 
H
ere’s where you learn how to use statistics to sum-
marize and describe data. I begin by showing you 
how to use the Excel graphics capabilities to produce the 
kinds of graphs statisticians use. From there, I move on 
to descriptive statistics — average, variance, standard 
deviation, and some others. I tell you how to combine a 
couple of these statistics to standardize scores. Finally, 
I describe the normal distribution, a very important topic 
in statistics. Along the way, you find out about Excel func-
tions and data analysis tools that cover all the statistical 
ideas in this part.

Chapter 3
Show and Tell: Graphing Data
In This Chapter
▶ Introducing graphs
▶ Working with Excel’s graphics capabilities
▶ Creating graphs for statistical work
T
he visual presentation of data is extremely important in statistics. Visual 
presentation enables you to discern relationships and trends you might 
not see if you just look at numbers. Visual presentation helps in another way: 
It’s valuable for presenting ideas to groups and making them understand 
your point of view. 
Graphs come in many varieties. In this chapter, I explore the types of graphs 
you use in statistics and when it’s advisable to use them. I also show you how 
to use Excel to create those graphs.
Why Use Graphs?
Suppose you have to make a pitch to a Congressional committee about com-
mercial space revenues in the early 1990s.
Which would you rather present? The data in Table 3-1, or the graph in 
Figure 3-1 that shows the same data? (The data, by the way, are from the U.S. 
Department of Commerce, via the Statistical Abstract of the U.S.)

 Chapter 3: Show and Tell: Graphing Data
Which one would have a greater and more lasting impact? Although the 
table is certainly informative, most would argue that the graph gets the point 
across better and more memorably. Eyes that glaze over when looking at 
numbers often shine brighter when looking at pictures. 
The graph shows you trends you might not see as quickly on the table. 
(Satellite services rose fastest. Commercial launches, not so much.) Bottom 
line: Tables are good, graphs are better.
Graphs help bring concepts to life that might otherwise be difficult to under-
stand. In fact, I do that throughout the book. I illustrate points by . . . well . . . 
illustrating points! 
Some Fundamentals
Like the graph in Figure 3-1, most graph formats have a horizontal axis and 
a vertical axis. The pie graph, a format I show you later in this chapter, does 
not. By convention, the horizontal axis is also called the x-axis and the verti-
cal axis is also called the y-axis. 
Also, by convention, what goes on the horizontal axis is called the indepen-
dent variable and what goes on the vertical axis is called the dependent vari-
able. One of Excel’s graph formats reverses that convention, and I bring that 
to your attention when I cover it. 
 
Just to give you a heads up, Excel calls that reversed-axis format a bar graph. 
You might have seen the graph in Figure 3-1 referred to as a bar graph. So 
have I. Excel calls Figure 3-1 a column graph, so I use “columns” from here on.
Getting back to “independent” and “dependent,” those terms imply that 
changes in the vertical direction depend (at least partly) on changes in the 
horizontal direction.
Another fundamental principle of creating a graph: Don’t wear out the view-
er’s eyes! If you put too much into a graph in the way of information or spe-
cial effects, you defeat the whole purpose of the graph. 
For example, in Figure 3-1 I had to make some choices about filling in the 
columns. Color-coded columns would have been helpful, but the page you’re 
looking at only shows black, white, and shades of gray. 
A lot of graph creation comes with experience, and you just have to use 
your judgment. In this case, my judgment came into play with the horizontal 
gridlines. In most graphs, I prefer not to have them. Here, they seem to add 

58
Part II: Describing Data 
structure and help the viewer figure out the dollar value associated with each 
column. But then again, that’s just my opinion.
Excel’s Graphics Capabilities
As I mention a couple of paragraphs ago, the graph in Figure 3-1 is a column 
graph. It’s one of many types of graphs you can create with Excel. Of all the 
graphics possibilities Excel provides, however, only a few are useful for sta-
tistical work. Those are the ones I cover in this chapter.
In addition to the column graph, I show you how to create pie graphs, bar 
graphs, line graphs, and scatter plots. Excel refers to each one as a chart 
rather than a “graph.” In this chapter, I use the two terms interchangeably.
Inserting a chart
In Excel 2007, you insert a chart into a spreadsheet. This immediately clues 
you that the chart creation tools are in the Charts area of the Insert tab. (See 
Figure 3-2.)
 
Figure 3-2: 
The Charts 
area of the 
Insert tab.
 
In Excels past a Chart Wizard guided you step by step through chart creation. 
The chart took shape within the wizard as you worked. You didn’t see the full 
chart on the worksheet (or on a separate page) until you closed the wizard. 
Excel 2007 turns the process inside out and simplifies it. Instead of making 
decisions within the wizard (which is no longer available), you immediately 
insert a chart into your spreadsheet. Then you use Design and Layout capa-
bilities to modify the chart and make it look just the way you want it.
You follow these steps:
 
1. Enter your data into a worksheet.
 
2. Select the data that go into the chart.

59
 Chapter 3: Show and Tell: Graphing Data
 
3. In the Charts area of the Insert tab, select the chart type.
 
 When you select a chart type, a box opens that presents a variety of sub-
types. Choose one and Excel creates a chart in your worksheet.
 
4. Modify the chart.
 
 Click on the chart, and Excel adds a Design tab and a Layout tab to the 
Ribbon. These tabs allow you to make all kinds of changes to your chart.
It’s really that simple. The next section shows what I mean.
 
By the way, here’s one more important concept about Excel graphics. In Excel, 
a chart is dynamic. This means that after you create a chart, changing its work-
sheet data results in an immediate change in the chart.
Becoming a Columnist
In this section, I show you how to create that spiffy graph in Figure 3-1. 
Follow these steps:
 
1. Enter your data into a worksheet. 
 
 Figure 3-3 shows the data from Table 3-1 entered into a worksheet. 
 
Figure 3-3: 
Table 3-1 
data entered 
into a 
worksheet.
 
 
2. Select the data that go into the chart.
 
 I selected A1:F7. The selection includes the labels for the axes but 
doesn’t include row G, which holds the column totals.
 
3. In the Charts area of the Insert tab, select the chart type.
 
 For this example, the chart type is Column. Selecting Insert | Charts | 
Column opens the gallery in Figure 3-4. Here, you select the specific type 
of column chart for the data. I selected the first choice in the top row 
(Clustered Column).

60
Part II: Describing Data 
 
Figure 3-4: 
The gallery 
for a column 
chart.
 
 
4. Modify the chart.
 
 Figure 3-5 shows the resulting chart, as well as the Design tab and the 
Layout tab. As you can see, I have to do some heavyweight modifying. 
Why? Excel has guessed wrong about how I wanted to design the chart. 
It looks okay, but it’s not. Rather than the years on the x-axis, Excel laid 
out the industry types. In other words, it interchanged the rows and 
columns.
 
Figure 3-5: 
The semi-
finished 
graph — 
based on a 
bad guess 
By Excel.
 

61
 Chapter 3: Show and Tell: Graphing Data
 
 Fortunately, Excel provides a quick fix. Figure 3-5 shows the Design tab 
selected. In the Design | Data area, the choice on the left is Switch Row/
Column. So . . . selecting Design | Data | Switch Row/Column does the 
trick.
 
 Some work remains. The axes aren’t labeled yet, and the graph has no 
title. Here’s where the Layout tab comes into play. Figure 3-6 shows 
Layout | Axis Titles selected, along with the drop-down menu that 
allows you to add the title for each axis. Primary Horizontal Axis Title 
and Primary Vertical Axis Title provide options for laying out the axis 
titles. Layout | Chart Title does the same for the title of the chart. 
 
 Adding the titles finishes things off. The result looks like the chart in 
Figure 3-1.
 
Figure 3-6: 
The Layout 
tab enables 
you to add 
titles.
 
Stacking the columns
If I had selected Column’s second subtype — Stacked Column — I would have 
created a set of columns that presents the same information in a slightly dif-
ferent way. Each column represents the total of all the data series at a point 
on the x-axis. Each column is divided into segments. Each segment’s size is 
proportional to how much it contributes to the total. Figure 3-7 shows this.

Table 3-1.
 
Notice that the data series are in reverse order from the way they’re set up 
in the first column graph. Excel sets them up in this order for the stacked col-
umns, and in the other order for the clustered columns. 
I inserted each graph into the worksheet. Excel also allows you to move a 
graph to a separate page in the workbook. Select Design | Location | Move 
Chart (it’s on the extreme right of the Design tab) to open the Move Chart 
dialog box. Click the New Sheet radio button to add a worksheet and move 
the chart there. Figure 3-8 shows how the chart looks on its own page.
In Appendix C, by the way, I show you another use for the stacked column 
chart.
This is a nice way of showing percentage changes over the course of time. If 
you just want to focus on percentages in one year, another type of graph is 
more effective. I discuss it in a moment, but first I want to tell you . . .

One more thing 
Statisticians often use column graphs to show how frequently something occurs. 
For example, in a thousand tosses of a pair of dice how many times does a 6 come 
up? How many tosses result in a 7? The x-axis shows each possible outcome 
of the dice-tosses, and the heights of the columns represent the frequencies. 
Whenever the heights represent frequencies, your column graph is a histogram.
It’s easy enough to use Excel’s graphics capabilities to set up a histogram, 
but Excel makes it easier still. Excel provides a data analysis tool that does 
everything you need to create a histogram. It’s called — believe it or not — 
Histogram. You provide an array of cells that hold all the data — like the 
outcomes of many dice-tosses, and an array that holds a list of intervals — 
like the possible outcomes of the tosses (the numbers 2–12). Histogram goes 
through the data array, counts the frequencies within each interval, and then 
draws the column graph. I describe this tool in greater detail in Chapter 7.

Part II: Describing Data 
Slicing the Pie
On to the next chart type. To show the percentages that make up one total, a 
pie graph gets the job done effectively. 
Suppose you want to focus on the U.S. commercial space revenues in 1994 — 
that is, on the last column of data in Table 3-1. You’ll catch people’s attention 
if you present the data in the form of a pie graph, like the one in Figure 3-9.
 
Figure 3-9: 
A pie graph 
of the last 
column 
of data in 
Table 3-1.
 
Here’s how to create this graph:
 
1. Enter your data into a worksheet.
 
 Pretty easy, as I’ve already done this.
 
2. Select the data that go into the chart.
 
 I want the names in column A and the data in column F. The trick is to 
select column A (cells A2 through A7)in the usual way and then press 
and hold the CTRL key. While holding this key, drag the cursor through 
F2 through F7. Voilà — two nonadjoining columns are selected 
 
3. In the Charts area of the Insert tab, select the chart type.
 
 I selected Insert | Pie and then chose the first subtype.

65
 Chapter 3: Show and Tell: Graphing Data
 
4. Modify the chart.
 
 Figure 3-10 shows the initial pie chart on its own page. To get it to look 
like Figure 3-9, I had to do a lot of modifying. 
 
Figure 3-10: 
The initial 
pie chart 
on its own 
page.
 
 
 The little slice filled in black represents 1 percent of the pie (Commercial 
R&D Infrastructure) and might be hard to see. I changed the fill color 
from black to white and added a border. How? I clicked on that slice 
and several slices were selected. Clicking again isolated it. Then I right-
clicked to open the menu in Figure 3-11. Choosing Format Data Point 
opens the Format Data Point dialog box (Figure 3-12). I worked with Fill 
and Border to change the slice to a white fill with a black border.
 
Figure 3-11:

 I selected Layout | Data Labels | Best Fit to add the data to each slice. 
 
 With the data labels selected, I right-clicked to open a couple of menus 
(Figure 3-13) that enabled me to manipulate the color and size of the 
data label font. After I made them all white, the label outside the small 
slice became invisible, but right-clicking in its area allowed me to reset 
its font to black. Right-clicking on the legend brings up the same menus 
for modifying the size of the font in the legend.

ing the color

Pulling the slices apart
One variant of the pie chart is to explode the slices. I’m not particularly fond 
of this type of graph, but you might be. In some circumstances, it might come 
in handy. 

67
 Chapter 3: Show and Tell: Graphing Data
One of the nice things about Excel’s graphics capabilities is that you can 
“what-if” to your heart’s content. So . . . after I finish creating the pie chart, 
I can explode it. To do that, I click on the chart and select Design | Change 
Chart Type. This opens the Change Chart Type dialog box shown in Figure 
3-14. Selecting the pie chart subtype that separates the slices (Exploded Pie) 
creates the chart in Figure 3-15.
 
Figure 3-14: 
The Change 
Chart Type 
dialog box.
 
Whenever you set up a pie graph — whether intact or exploded — always 
keep in mind . . . .

Part II: Describing Data 
A word from the wise
Social commentator, raconteur, and former baseball player Yogi Berra once 
went to a restaurant and ordered a whole pizza. 
“How many slices should I cut,” asked the waitress, “four or eight?” 
 “Better make it four,” said Yogi, “I’m not hungry enough to eat eight.”
Yogi’s insightful analysis leads to a useful guideline about pie graphs: They’re 
more digestible if they have fewer slices. If you cut a pie graph too fine, 
you’re likely to leave your audience with information overload.
Drawing the Line
In the preceding example, I focused on one column of data from Table 3-1. In 
this one, I focus on one row. The idea is to trace the progress of one space-
related industry across the years 1990–1994. In this example, I graph the 
revenues from Satellite Services. The final product, shown on its own page, is 
Figure 3-16.
 
Figure 3-16: 
A line graph 
of the sec-
ond Row 
of Data in 
Table 3-1.
 
A line graph is a good way to show change over time, when you aren’t deal-
ing with too many data series. If you try to graph all six industries on one line 
graph, it begins to look like spaghetti. 

69
 Chapter 3: Show and Tell: Graphing Data
How do you create a graph like Figure 3-16? Follow along:
 
1. Enter your data into a worksheet.
 
 Once again, already done.
 
2. Select the data that go into the chart.
 
 For this example, that’s cells B3 through F3.
 
 Whoa! Did I forget something? What about that little trick I showed you 
before where you hold down the CTRL key and select additional cells? 
Couldn’t I do that and select the top row of years for the x-axis?
 
 Nope. Not this time. If I do that, Excel thinks 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, and 
1994 are just another series of data points to plot on the graph. I’ll show 
you another way to put those years on the x-axis.
 
3. In Charts area of the Insert tab, select the chart type.
 
 This time, it’s Insert | Line and then the fourth subtype, Line with 
Markers. This creates the chart in Figure 3-17.
 
Figure 3-17: 
Insert | Line 
| Line With

4. Modify the chart. 
 
 The line on the chart is a little hard to see. Selecting Design | Chart 
Styles and the leftmost option makes the line darker.
 
 Next, I added the titles for the chart and for the axes. Clicking the down 
arrow of Design | Chart Layouts opens a box with 12 possibilities. 
Selecting the tenth one creates text boxes for the titles on the chart.
 
 I still have to put the years on the x-axis. To do this, I right-clicked inside 
the chart to open the menu in Figure 3-18. 
 
Figure 3-18: 
Right-
clicking 
inside the 
chart opens 
this menu.
 
 
 Clicking Select Data opens the Select Data Source dialog box. (See Figure 
3-19.) In the box labeled Horizontal (Category) Axis Labels, clicking 
the Edit button opens the Axis Labels dialog box (Figure 3-20). A blink-
ing cursor in the Axis label range box shows it’s ready for business. 
Selecting cells B1 through F1 and clicking OK closes this dialog box. 
Clicking OK closes the Select Source dialog box and puts the years on 
the x-axis.
 
Figure 3-19: 
The Select

log box.
 
 
 One more modification completes the graph. The legend (showing 
“Series 1”) isn’t necessary. Right-click on it and choose Delete from the 
pop-up menu.

Passing the Bar 
Excel’s bar chart is a column chart laid on its side. This is the one that 
reverses the horizontal-vertical convention. Here, the vertical axis holds the 
independent variable, and it’s referred to as the x-axis. The horizontal axis is 
the y-axis and it tracks the dependent variable.
When would you use the bar graph? This type of graph fits the bill when you 
want to make a point about reaching a goal, or about the inequities in attain-
ing one. 
Table 3-2 shows the data on (what I feel, anyway) is an important social issue. 
The data, from the U.S. Census Bureau (via the U.S. Statistical Abstract), are 
for the year 2000. Percent means the percentage of children in each income 
group.

2. Select the data that go into the chart.
 
 For this example, the data are cells A1 through B8.
 
3. In the Charts area of the Insert tab, select the chart type.
 
 I clicked the down arrow for Insert | Bar and selected the first subtype 
(Clustered Bar). The result appears in Figure 3-23. The title is wrong and 
the legend is unnecessary, but I deal with that in Step 4.

4. Modify the chart.
 
 The first modification is to select a layout. This is a little confusing, 
because Design | Chart Layouts holds the desired look, rather than 
a ribbon area within the Layout tab. Go figure. The trick is to select a 
layout that puts text boxes for the titles onto the graph. The option that 
does this (Layout 8) is shown selected in Figure 3-24. (The other way to 
do this is with Layout | Labels as I showed you earlier.)

 After entering the labels, I deleted the legend. Then I darkened the bars 
via Design | Chart Styles. Right-clicking on each label brings up the 
menu for increasing the font size.

Part II: Describing Data 
The Plot Thickens
You use an important statistical technique called linear regression to deter-
mine the relationship between one variable, x, and another variable, y. For 
more information on linear regression, see Chapter 14.
The basis of the technique is a graph that shows individuals measured on 
both x and y. The graph represents each individual as a point. Because the 
points seem to scatter around the graph, the graph is called a scatterplot.
Suppose you’re trying to find out how well a test of aptitude for sales pre-
dicts salespeople’s productivity. You administer the test to a sample of sales-
persons and you tabulate how much money they make in commissions over a 
two-month period. Each person’s pair of scores (test score and commissions) 
locates him or her within the scatterplot. 
To create a scatterplot, follow the steps:
 
1. Enter your data into a worksheet. 
 
 Figure 3-25 shows the entered data.

2. Select the data that go into the chart.
 
 Figure 3-25 shows the selected cells — B2 through C21. (Including B1 
creates the same chart, but with an incorrect title.) The cells in Column 
A are just placeholders that organize the data.
 
3. In the Charts area of the Insert tab, select the chart type.
 
 I chose the first subtype of Insert | Scatter, resulting in the chart shown 
in Figure 3-26.

4. Modify the chart.
 
 Clicking Design | Chart Layouts and selecting the first layout puts the 
text box on the chart for each title. I typed the title for the chart and the 
titles for the axes and then deleted the legend. The result is the scatter-
plot in Figure 3-27.

the points. Excel refers to it as a trendline, but it’s really called a regression

their original locations.) What do they mean? What are those numbers all 
about?

S
tatisticians deal with groups of numbers. They often find it helpful to use 
a single number to summarize a group of numbers. Where would a single 
summary number come from?
The best bet is to find a number that’s somewhere in the middle, and use 
that number to stand for the whole group. If you look at a group of numbers 
and try to find one that’s somewhere in the middle, you’re dealing with that 
group’s central tendency. Like good ice cream, central tendency comes in sev-
eral flavors.
Means: The Lore of Averages
Just about everyone uses averages. The statistical term for an average is 
mean. Sometime in your life, you’ve undoubtedly calculated one. The mean is 
a quick way of characterizing your grades, your money, or perhaps your per-
formance in some task or sport over time. 
Another reason for calculating means concerns the kind of work that sci-
entists do. Typically, a scientist applies some kind of procedure to a small 
sample of people or things and measures the results in some way. He or she 
uses the results from the sample to estimate the effects of the procedure 
on the population that produced the sample. As it happens, the mean of the 
sample is the best estimate of the population mean.

80
Part II: Describing Data 
Calculating the mean
You probably don’t need me to tell you how to calculate a mean, but I’m 
going to do it anyway. Then I’ll show you the statistical formula. My goal is to 
help you understand statistical formulas in general, and then set you up for 
how Excel calculates means.
A mean is just the sum of a bunch of numbers divided by the amount of num-
bers you added up. Here’s an example. Suppose you measure the reading 
speeds of six children in words per minute, and you find that their speeds are
56, 78, 45, 49, 55, 62
The average reading speed of these six children is
That is, the mean of this sample is 57.5 words per minute.
A first try at a formula might be
This is unwieldy as formulas go, so statisticians use abbreviations. A com-
monly used abbreviation for “Number” is x. A typical abbreviation for 
“Amount of Numbers You Added Up” is N. With these abbreviations, the for-
mula becomes
Another abbreviation, used throughout statistics, stands for Sum of. It’s the 
uppercase Greek letter for S. It’s pronounced “sigma” and it looks like this: Σ. 
Here’s the formula with the sigma:
What about “mean”? Statisticians abbreviate that, too. M would be a good 
abbreviation, and some statisticians use it, but most use  (pronounced “X 
bar”) to represent the mean. So here’s the formula:

81
 Chapter 4: Finding Your Center
Is that it? Well . . . not quite. English letters, like , represent characteristics 
of samples. For characteristics of populations, the abbreviations are Greek 
letters. For the population mean, the abbreviation is the Greek equivalent of 
M, which is μ (pronounced like “you” but with “m” in front of it). The formula 
for the population mean, then, is
AVERAGE and AVERAGEA
Excel’s AVERAGE worksheet function calculates the mean of a set of numbers. 
Figure 4-1 shows the data and Function Arguments dialog box for AVERAGE.
 
Figure 4-1: 
Working 
with 
AVERAGE.
 
Here are the steps:
 
1. In your worksheet, enter your numbers into an array of cells and 
select the cell where you want AVERAGE to place the result. 
 
 For this example, I entered 56, 78, 45, 49, 55, 62 into cells B2 through B7, 
and I selected B8 for the result. 

82
Part II: Describing Data 
 
2. From the Statistical Functions menu, choose AVERAGE to open the 
AVERAGE Function Arguments dialog box.
 
3. In the Function Arguments dialog box, enter the values for the 
arguments.
 
 If the array of number-containing cells isn’t already in the Number1 box, 
I enter it into that box. The mean (57.5 for this example) appears in this 
dialog box. 
 
4. Click OK to close the AVERAGE Function Arguments dialog box.
 
 This puts the mean into the cell selected in the worksheet. In this exam-
ple, that’s B8.
As you can see in Figure 4-1, the formula in the Formula bar is
=AVERAGE(B2:B7)
Had I defined Number as the name of B2 through B7 (see Chapter 2), the for-
mula would be
=AVERAGE(Number)
AVERAGEA does the same thing as AVERAGE, but with one important difference. 
When AVERAGE calculates a mean, it ignores cells that contain text and it ignores 
cells that contain the expressions TRUE or FALSE. AVERAGEA takes text and 
expressions into consideration when it calculates a mean. As far as AVERAGEA is 
concerned, if a cell has text or FALSE, it has a value of 0. If a cell holds the word 
TRUE, it has a value of 1. AVERAGEA includes these values in the mean.
I’m not sure that you’ll use this capability during everyday statistical work 
(I never have), but Excel has worksheet functions like AVERAGEA, VARA, and 
STDEVA, and I want you to know how they operate. So here are the steps for 
AVERAGEA.
 
1. Type the numbers into the worksheet and select a cell for the result.
 
 For this example, I entered the numbers 56, 78, 45, 49, 55, 62 in cells B2 
through B7 and select B9. This leaves B8 blank. I did this because I’m going 
to put different values into B8 and show you the effect on AVERAGEA.
 
2. From the Statistical Functions menu, select AVERAGEA to open the 
AVERAGEA Function Arguments dialog box.
 
3. In the Function Arguments dialog box, enter the values for the 
arguments. 
 
 This time I entered B2:B8 into the Number1 box. The mean (57.5) 
appears in this dialog box. AVERAGEA ignores blank cells, just as 
AVERAGE does.
 
4. Click OK to close the Function Arguments dialog box and the answer 
appears in the selected cell.

83
 Chapter 4: Finding Your Center
Now for some experimentation. In B8, if I type xxx, the mean in B9 changes 
from 57.5 to 49.28571. Next, typing TRUE into B8 changes the mean in B9 to 
49.42857. Finally, after typing FALSE into B8, the mean changes to 49.28571. 
Why the changes? AVERAGEA evaluates a text string like xxx as zero. Thus, 
the average in this case is based on seven numbers (not six), one of which 
is zero. AVERAGEA evaluates the value TRUE as 1. So the average with TRUE 
in B8 is based on seven numbers, one of which is 1.00. AVERAGEA evaluates 
FALSE as zero, and calculates the same average as when B8 holds xxx.
AVERAGEIF and AVERAGEIFS
These two functions are new in Excel 2007. They calculate average condition-
ally. AVERAGEIF includes numbers in the average if a particular condition is 
met. AVERAGEIFS includes numbers in the average if more than one condi-
tion is met.
To show you how these two new functions work, I set up the worksheet in 
Figure 4-2. The entries represent the data from a fictional psychology experi-
ment. In this experiment, a person sits in front of a screen and a color-filled 
shape appears. The color is either red or green and the shape is either a 
square or a circle. The combination for each trial is random, and all combina-
tions appear an equal number of times. In the lingo of the field, each appear-
ance of a color-filled shape is called a trial. So the worksheet shows the 
outcomes of 16 trials.
 
Figure 4-2: 
Data from 
16 trials of 
a fictional 
psychology 
experiment.
 
The person sitting in front of the screen presses a button as soon as he or she 
sees the shape. Column D (labeled RT msec) presents one person’s reaction 

84
Part II: Describing Data 
time in milliseconds (thousandths of a second) for each trial. Columns B 
and C show the characteristics of the shape presented on that trial. So, for 
example, row 2 tells you that on the first trial, a red circle appeared and the 
person responded in 410 msec (milliseconds).
For each column, I defined the name in the top cell of the column to refer 
to the data in that column. If you don’t remember how to do that, reread 
Chapter 2.
I’ve calculated three averages. The first, Average Overall (in cell D19) is just
=AVERAGE(RT_msec)
What about those other two? Cell D20 holds the average of trials that dis-
played a circle. That’s what I mean by a conditional average. It’s the average 
of trials that meet the condition Shape = Circle.
Figure 4-3 shows the completed Function Arguments dialog box for 
AVERAGEIF. The formula created after clicking OK is
=AVERAGEIF(Shape,”Circle”,RT_msec)
What the dialog box and the formula are telling you is this: Excel includes a 
cell in column D (RT_msec) in the average if the corresponding cell in column 
B (Shape) holds the value “Circle.” If not, the cell is not included.
 
Figure 4-3: 
The 
completed 
dialog 
box for 
AVERAGEIF.
 
To create this formula, follow these steps:
 
1. Type the numbers into the worksheet and select a cell for the result.
 
 The cell I selected is D20.
 
2. From the Statistical Functions menu select AVERAGEIF to open the 
AVERAGEIF Function Arguments dialog box.

85
 Chapter 4: Finding Your Center
 
3. In the Function Arguments dialog box, enter the values for the 
arguments.
 
 For AVERAGEIF in this example the Range is Shape, the Criteria is 
“Circle” (Excel types the double-quotes), and the Average_range is 
RT_msec.
 
4. Click OK to close the Function Arguments dialog box and the answer 
appears in the selected cell.
Some more on AVERAGEIF: To find the average of the first eight trials, the 
formula is
=AVERAGEIF(Trial,”<9”,RT_msec)
To find the average of reaction times faster than 400 msec the formula is 
=AVERAGEIF(RT_msec,”<400”,RT_msec)
 
For each of these last two, the operator “<” precedes the numeric value. If you 
try to somehow set it up so that the value precedes the operator, the formula 
won’t work.
What about the average for Green Squares in cell D21? Figure 4-4 shows the 
completed dialog box for AVERAGEIFS, which can work with more than one 
criterion. The formula for calculating the average of trials on which Color = 
Green and Shape = Square is
=AVERAGEIFS(RT_msec,Color,”Green”,Shape,”Square”)
 
Figure 4-4: 
The 
completed 
dialog 
box for 
AVERAGEIFS.
 
Notice that RT_msec is the first argument in AVERAGEIFS but the last argu-
ment in AVERAGEIF.

86
Part II: Describing Data 
To create this formula, follow these steps:
 
1. Type the numbers into the worksheet and select a cell for the result.
 
 The cell I selected is D21.
 
2. From the Statistical Functions menu select AVERAGEIFS to open the 
AVERAGEIFS Function Arguments dialog box.
 
3. In the Function Arguments dialog box, enter the values for the 
arguments.
 
 For AVERAGEIFS in this example the Average_range is RT_msec. 
Criteria_range1 is “Color” and Criteria1 is “Green”. Criteria_range2 is 
Shape, the Criteria is “Square”. (Excel types the double-quotes.)
 
4. Click OK to close the Function Arguments dialog box and the answer 
appears in the selected cell.
Given what you just saw, you may be wondering why it’s necessary for Excel 
to have both AVERAGEIF and AVERAGEIFS. After all, 
=AVERAGEIF(Shape,”Circle”,RT_msec)
gives the same answer as
=AVERAGEIFS(RT_msec, Shape,”Circle”)
So why two functions? Short answer: I don’t know. Long answer: I don’t know.
TRIMMEAN
In a retake on a famous quote about statistics, someone said “There are three 
kinds of liars: liars, darned liars, and statistical outliers.” An outlier is an 
extreme value in a set of scores — so extreme, in fact, that the person who 
gathered the scores believes that something is amiss.
One example of outliers involves psychology experiments that measure a 
person’s time to make a decision. Measured in thousandths of a second, 
these “reaction times” depend on the complexity of the decision. The more 
complex the decision, the longer the reaction time. 
Typically, a person in this kind of experiment goes through many experimen-
tal trials — one decision per trial. A trial with an overly fast reaction time 
(way below the average) might indicate that the person made a quick guess 
without really considering what he or she was supposed to do. A trial with a 
very slow reaction time (way above the average) might mean that the person 
wasn’t paying attention at first and then buckled down to the task at hand.

 Chapter 4: Finding Your Center
Either kind of outlier can get in the way of conclusions based on averaging 
the data. For this reason, it’s often a good idea to eliminate them before you 
calculate the mean. Statisticians refer to this as “trimming the mean,” and 
Excel’s TRIMMEAN function does this.
Here’s how you use TRIMMEAN:
 
1. Type the scores into a worksheet and select a cell for the result. 
 
 For this example, I put these numbers into cells B2 through B11:
 
 500, 280, 550, 540, 525, 595, 620, 1052, 591, 618
 
 These scores might result from a psychology experiment that measures 
reaction time in thousandths of a second (milliseconds). I selected B12 
for the result.
 
2. From the Statistical Functions menu, select TRIMMEAN to open the 
TRIMMEAN Function Arguments dialog box.
 
3. In the Function Arguments dialog box, type the values for the 
arguments. 
 
 The data array goes into the Array box. For this example, that’s B2:B11. 
 
 Next, I have to identify the percent of scores I want to trim. In the Percent 
box, I enter .2. This tells TRIMMEAN to eliminate the extreme 20 percent 
of the scores before calculating the mean. The extreme 20 percent means 
the highest 10 percent of scores and the lowest 10 percent of scores. 
Figure 4-5 shows the dialog box, the array of scores, and the selected 
cell. The dialog box shows the value of the trimmed mean, 567.375.

Part II: Describing Data 
 
The label Percent is a little misleading here. You have to express the percent 
as a decimal. So you enter .2 rather than 20 in the Percent box if you want to 
trim the extreme 20 percent. (Quick question: If you enter 0 in the Percent 
box, what’s the answer equivalent to? Answer: AVERAGE(B2:B11)
 
What percentage of scores should you trim? That’s up to you. It depends on 
what you’re measuring, how extreme your scores can be, and how well you 
know the area you’re studying. When you do trim scores and report a mean, 
it’s important to let people know that you’ve done this and to let them know 
the percentage you’ve trimmed.
In the upcoming section on the median, I show you another way to deal with 
extreme scores.
Other means to an end
This section deals with two types of averages that are different from the one 
you’re familiar with. I tell you about them because you might run into them 
as you go through Excel’s statistical capabilities. (How many different kinds 
of averages are possible? Ancient Greek mathematicians came up with 11!)
Geometric mean
Suppose you have a two-year investment that yields 25 percent the first year 
and 75 percent the second year. (If you do, I want to know about it!) What’s 
the average annual rate of return?
To answer that question, you might be tempted to find the mean of 25 and 75 
(which averages out to 50). But that misses an important point: At the end of 
the first year, you multiply your investment by 1.25 — you don’t add 1.25 to it. 
At the end of the second year, you multiply the first-year result by 1.75. 
The regular everyday garden-variety mean won’t give you the average rate of 
return. Instead, you calculate the mean this way:
The average rate of return is about 65.4 percent, not 50 percent. This kind of 
average is called the geometric mean. 
In this example, the geometric mean is the square root of the product of two 
numbers. For three numbers, the geometric mean is the cube root of the product 
of the three. For four numbers, it’s the fourth root of their product, and so on. 
In general, the geometric mean of N numbers is the Nth root of their product. 
The Excel worksheet function GEOMEAN calculates the geometric mean of 
a group of numbers. Follow the same steps as you would for AVERAGE, but 
select GEOMEAN from the Statistical Functions menu.

89
 Chapter 4: Finding Your Center
Harmonic mean
Still another mean is something you run into when you have to solve the 
kinds of problems that live in algebra textbooks. 
Suppose, for example, you’re in no particular hurry to get to work in the morn-
ing, and you drive from your house to your job at the rate of 40 miles per hour. 
At the end of the day you’d like to get home quickly, so on the return trip (over 
exactly the same distance) you drive from your job to your house at 60 miles 
per hour. What is your average speed for the total time you’re on the road?
It’s not 50 miles per hour, because you’re on the road a different amount of 
time on each leg of the trip. Without going into this in too much detail, the 
formula for figuring this one out is
The average here is 48. This kind of average is called a harmonic mean. I 
show it to you for two numbers, but you can calculate it for any amount of 
numbers. Just put each number in the denominator of a fraction with 1 as the 
numerator. Mathematicians call this the reciprocal of a number. (So 1/40 is 
the reciprocal of 40.) Add all the reciprocals together and take their average. 
The result is the reciprocal of the harmonic mean. 
In the rare event you ever have to figure one of these out in the real world, Excel 
saves you from the drudgery of calculation. The worksheet function HARMEAN 
calculates the harmonic mean of a group of numbers. Follow the same steps as 
you would for AVERAGE, but in the Statistical Functions menu select HARMEAN.
Medians: Caught in the Middle
 
The mean is a useful way to summarize a group of numbers. It’s sensitive to 
extreme values, however: If one number is out of whack relative to the others, 
the mean quickly gets out of whack, too. When that happens, the mean might 
not be a good representative of the group.
For example, with these numbers as reading speeds (in words per minute) 
for a group of children
56, 78, 45, 49, 55, 62
the mean is 57.5. Suppose the child who reads at 78 words per minute leaves 
the group and an exceptionally fast reader replaces him. Her reading speed is 
180 words per minute. Now the group’s reading speeds are
56, 180, 45, 49, 55, 62

90
Part II: Describing Data 
The new average is 74.5. It’s misleading because except for the new child, no 
one else in the group reads nearly that fast. In a case like this, it’s a good idea 
to turn to a different measure of central tendency — the median.
Simply put, the median is the middle value in a group of numbers. Arrange 
the numbers in order, and the median is the value below which half the 
scores fall and above which half the scores fall.
Finding the median
In our example, the first group of reading speeds (in increasing order) is:
45, 49, 55, 56, 62, 78
The median is right in the middle of 55 and 56 — it’s 55.5
What about the group with the new child? That’s
45, 49, 55, 56, 62, 180
The median is still 55.5. The extreme value doesn’t change the median. 
MEDIAN
The worksheet function MEDIAN (you guessed it) calculates the median of a 
group of numbers. Here are the steps:
 
1. Type your data into a worksheet and select a cell for the result. 
 
 I used 45, 49, 55, 56, 62, 78 for this example, in cells B2 through B7, with 
cell B8 selected for the median. I arranged the numbers in increasing 
order, but you don’t have to do that to use MEDIAN.
 
2. From the Statistical Functions menu, select MEDIAN to open the 
MEDIAN Function Arguments dialog box.
 
3. In the Function Arguments dialog box, enter the values for the 
arguments.
 
 The Function Arguments dialog box opens with the data array in the 
Number1 box. The median appears in that dialog box. (It’s 55.5 for this 
example.) Figure 4-6 shows the dialog box along with the array of cells 
and the selected cell.
 
4. Click OK to close the dialog box and the answer appears in the 
selected cell.

As an exercise, replace 78 with 180 in A6, and you’ll see that the median 
doesn’t change.
In Appendix C, I explore an application of the median.
Statistics À La Mode
One more measure of central tendency is important. This one is the score 
that occurs most frequently in a group of scores. It’s called the mode.
Finding the mode
Nothing is complicated about finding the mode. Look at the scores, find the 
one that occurs most frequently, and you’ve found the mode. Two scores tie 
for that honor? In that case, your set of scores has two modes. (The technical 
name is bimodal.) 
Can you have more than two modes? Absolutely. 
Suppose every score occurs equally often. When that happens, you have no 
mode.
Sometimes, the mode is the most representative measure of central tendency. 
Imagine a small company that consists of 30 consultants and two high-ranking 
officers. Each consultant has an annual salary of $40,000. Each officer has an 
annual salary of $250,000. The mean salary in this company is $53,125. 
Does the mean give you a clear picture of the company’s salary structure? If 
you were looking for a job with that company, would the mean influence your 

92
Part II: Describing Data 
expectations? You’re probably better off if you consider the mode, which in 
this case is $40,000. 
MODE
Excel’s MODE function finds the mode for you. 
 
1. Type your data into a worksheet and select a cell for the result. 
 
 I use 56, 23, 77, 75, 57, 75, 91, 59, and 75 in this example. The data are in 
cells B2 through B10, with B11 as the selected cell for the mode.
 
2. From the Statistical Functions menu, select MODE to open the MODE 
Function Arguments dialog box. (See Figure 4-7).
 
3. In the Function Arguments dialog box, type the values for the 
arguments.
 
 The Function Arguments dialog box opens with an array highlighted in 
the Number1 box. For this example the highlighted array is correct, and 
the mode (75 for this example) appears in the dialog box.

H
ere are three pieces of wisdom about statisticians:
Piece of Wisdom #1: “A statistician is a person who stands in a bucket of ice 
water, sticks their head in an oven and says ‘on average, I feel fine.’” 
(K. Dunning)
Piece of Wisdom #2: “A statistician drowned crossing a stream with an aver-
age depth of 6 inches.” (Anonymous)
Piece of Wisdom #3: “Three statisticians go deer hunting with bows and 
arrows. They spot a big buck and take aim. One shoots and his arrow flies 
off ten feet to the left. The second shoots and his arrow goes ten feet to the 
right. The third statistician jumps up and down yelling, ‘We got him! We got 
him!’” (Bill Butz, quoted by Diana McLellan in Washingtonian)
What’s the common theme? Calculating the mean is a great way to summa-
rize a group of numbers, but it doesn’t supply all the information you typi-
cally need. If you just rely on the mean, you might miss something important.
To avoid missing important information, another type of statistic is necessary — 
a statistic that measures variation. It’s a kind of average of how much each 
number in a group differs from the group mean. Several statistics are avail-
able for measuring variation. All of them work the same way: The larger the 
value of the statistic, the more the numbers differ from the mean. The smaller 
the value, the less they differ.

94
Part II: Describing Data 
Measuring Variation
Suppose you measure the heights of a group of children and you find that 
their heights (in inches) are
48, 48, 48, 48, 48
Then you measure another group and find that their heights are
50, 47, 52, 46, 45
If you calculate the mean of each group, you’ll find they’re the same — 48 inches. 
Just looking at the numbers tells you the two groups of heights are different: 
The heights in the first group are all the same, while the heights in the second 
vary quite a bit.
Averaging squared deviations: Variance 
and how to calculate it
One way to show the dissimilarity between the two groups is to examine the 
deviations in each one. Think of a “deviation” as the difference between a 
score and the mean of all the scores in a group. 
Here’s what I’m talking about. Table 5-1 shows the first group of heights and 
their deviations.

One way to proceed is to average the deviations. Clearly, the average of the 
numbers in the Deviation column is zero.
Table 5-2 shows the second group of heights and their deviations.

What about the average of the deviations in Table 5-2? That’s . . . zero!
Hmmm . . . Now what? 
 
Averaging the deviations doesn’t help us see a difference between the two 
groups, because the average of deviations from the mean in any group of num-
bers is always zero. In fact, veteran statisticians will tell you that’s a defining 
property of the mean. 
The joker in the deck here is the negative numbers. How do statisticians deal 
with them?
The trick is to use something you might recall from algebra: A minus times a 
minus is a plus. Sound familiar?
So . . . does this mean that you multiply each deviation times itself, and then 
average the results? Absolutely. Multiplying a deviation times itself is called 
squaring a deviation. The average of the squared deviations is so important 
that it has a special name: variance.
Table 5-3 shows the group of heights from Table 5-2, along with their devia-
tions and squared deviations.

Part II: Describing Data 
The variance — the average of the squared deviations for this group — is  
(4 + 1 + 16 + 4 + 9)/5 = 34/5 = 6.8. This, of course, is very different from the 
first group, whose variance is zero.
To develop the variance formula for you and show you how it works, I use 
symbols to show all this.  represents the Height heading in the first column 
of the table and  represents the mean. Because a deviation is the result of 
subtracting the mean from each number, 
represents a deviation. Multiplying a deviation by itself? That’s just 
To calculate variance you square each deviation, add them up, and find the 
average of the squared deviations. If N represents the amount of squared 
deviations you have (in our example, five), then the formula for calculating 
the variance is
Σ is the uppercase Greek letter sigma and it stands for the sum of. 
What’s the symbol for Variance? As I say in Chapter 1, Greek letters represent 
population parameters and English letters represent statistics. Imagine that 
our little group of five numbers is an entire population. Does the Greek alpha-
bet have a letter that corresponds to V in the same way that μ (the symbol 
for the population mean) corresponds to M?
 
As a matter of fact, it doesn’t. Instead, we use the lowercase sigma! It looks like 
this: σ. Not only that, but because we’re talking about squared quantities, the 
symbol is σ2. 
So the formula for calculating variance is:

97
 Chapter 5: Deviating from the Average
 
Variance is large if the numbers in a group vary greatly from their mean. 
Variance is small if the numbers are very similar to their mean.
The variance you just worked through is appropriate if the group of five 
measurements is a population. Does this mean that variance for a sample is 
different? It does, and you’ll see why in a minute. First, I turn your attention 
back to Excel.
VARP and VARPA
Excel’s two worksheet functions, VARP and VARPA, calculate the population 
variance. 
Start with VARP. Figure 5-1 shows the Function Arguments dialog box for 
VARP along with data. Here are the steps to follow:
 
Figure 5-1: 
Working 
with VARP.
 
 
1. Put your data into a worksheet and select a cell to display the result. 
 
 Figure 5-1 shows that for this example, I’ve put the numbers 50, 47, 52, 
46, 45 into cells B2 through B6 and selected B8 for the result.
 
2. From the Statistical Functions menu, select VARP to open the VARP 
Function Arguments dialog box.
 
3. In the Function Arguments dialog box, enter the appropriate values 
for the arguments.
 
 I entered B2:B6 in the Number1 field. The population variance, 6.8, 
appears in the Function Arguments dialog box.
 
4. Click OK to close the dialog box and put the result in the selected cell.

98
Part II: Describing Data 
Had I defined Score as the name of B2:B6 (see Chapter 2), the formula in the 
formula bar would be
=VARP(Score)
When VARP calculates the variance in a range of cells, it only sees numbers. 
If text or logical values are in some of the cells, VARP ignores them. 
VARPA, on the other hand, does not. VARPA takes text and logical values into 
consideration and includes them in its variance calculation. How? If a cell 
contains text, VARPA sees that cell as containing a value of zero. If a cell con-
tains the logical value FALSE, that’s also zero as far as VARPA is concerned. 
In VARPA’s view of the world, the logical value TRUE is one. Those zeros and 
ones get added into the mix and affect the mean and the variance.
To see this in action, I keep the numbers in cells B2 through B6 and again 
select cell B8. I follow the same steps as for VARP, but this time open the 
VARPA Function Arguments dialog box. In the Value1 field of the VARPA 
dialog box I type B2:B7 (that’s B7, not B6) and click OK. Cell B8 shows the 
same result as before because VARPA evaluates the blank cell B7 as no entry. 
Typing TRUE into Cell B7 changes the result in B8 because VARPA evaluates 
B7 as 1. (See Figure 5-2.)
 
Figure 5-2: 
VARPA 
evaluates 
TRUE as 1.0, 
changing 
the vari-
ance from 
the value in 
Figure 5-1.
 
Typing FALSE (or any other string of letters except TRUE) into B7 changes 
the value in B8 once again. This time, VARPA evaluates B7 as zero. 

99
 Chapter 5: Deviating from the Average
Sample variance
Earlier, I mentioned that you use this formula to calculate population 
variance:
I also said that sample variance is a little different. Here’s the difference. 
If your set of numbers is a sample drawn from a large population, you’re 
probably interested in using the variance of the sample to estimate the vari-
ance of the population. 
The formula you used for the variance doesn’t quite work as an estimate of 
the population variance. Although the sample mean works just fine as an 
estimate of the population mean, this doesn’t hold true with variance, for rea-
sons way beyond the scope of this book.
 
How do you calculate a good estimate of the population variance? It’s pretty 
easy. You just use N-1 in the denominator rather than N. (Again, for reasons 
way beyond our scope.)
Also, because we’re working with a characteristic of a sample (rather than 
of a population), we use the English equivalent of the Greek letter — s rather 
than σ. This means that the formula for the sample variance is
The value of s2, given the squared deviations in our set of five numbers is 
(4 + 1 + 16 + 4 + 9)/4 = 34/4 = 8.5
So, if these numbers
50, 47, 52, 46, 45
are an entire population, their variance is 6.4. If they’re a sample drawn from 
a larger population, our best estimate of that population’s variance is 8.5.

100
Part II: Describing Data 
VAR and VARA
The worksheet functions VAR and VARA calculate the sample variance.
Figure 5-3 shows the Function Arguments dialog box for VAR with 50, 47, 52, 
46, 45 entered into cells B2 through B6. Cell B7 is part of the cell range, but I 
left it empty.
 
Figure 5-3: 
Working 
with VAR.
 
 
The relationship between VAR and VARA is the same as the relationship 
between VARP and VARPA: VAR ignores cells that contain logical values 
(TRUE and FALSE) and text. VARA includes those cells. Once again, TRUE 
evaluates to 1.0 and FALSE evaluates to 0. Text in a cell causes VARA to see 
that cell’s value as 0. 
This is why I left B7 blank. If you experiment a bit with VARA and logical 
values or text in B7, you’ll see exactly what VARA does.
Back to the Roots: Standard Deviation
After you calculate the variance of a set of numbers, you have a value whose 
units are different from your original measurements. For example, if your 
original measurements are in inches, their variance is in square inches. This 
is because you square the deviations before you average them.
Often, it’s more intuitive if you have a variation statistic that’s in the same 
units as the original measurements. It’s easy to turn variance into that kind 
of statistic. All you have to do is take the square root of the variance. 

101
 Chapter 5: Deviating from the Average
Like the variance, this square root is so important that we give it a special 
name: standard deviation.
Population standard deviation
The standard deviation of a population is the square root of the population 
variance. The symbol for the population standard deviation is σ (sigma). Its 
formula is
For these measurements (in inches)
50, 47, 52, 46, 45
the population variance is 6.8 square inches, and the population standard 
deviation is 2.61 inches (rounded off).
STDEVP and STDEVPA

tion standard deviation. After entering your numbers into your worksheet 
and selecting a cell
 
1. Type your data into an array and select a cell for the result.

 After you enter the data array, the dialog box shows the value of the pop-

Like VARPA, STDEVPA uses any logical values and text values it finds when 
it calculates the population standard deviation. TRUE evaluates to 1.0 and 
FALSE evaluates to 0. Text in a cell gives that cell a value of 0.
Sample standard deviation
The standard deviation of a sample — an estimate of the standard deviation 
of a population — is the square root of the sample variance. Its symbol is s 
and its formula is
For these measurements (in inches)
50, 47, 52, 46, 45
the population variance is 8.4 square inches, and the population standard 
deviation is 2.92 inches (rounded off).

dard deviation. To work with STDEV

STDEVA uses text and logical values in its calculations. Cells with text have

evaluate to TRUE have values of 1.0.

The missing functions: STDEVIF and 
STDEVIFS
Here’s a rule of thumb: Whenever you present a mean, provide a standard 
deviation. Use AVERAGE and STDEV in tandem.
Remember that Excel 2007 offers two new functions, AVERAGEIF and 
AVERAGEIFS, for calculating means conditionally. (See Chapter 4.) Two 
additional new functions would have been helpful: STDEVIF and STDEVIFS 
for calculating standard deviations conditionally when you calculate means 
conditionally.

104
Part II: Describing Data 
Excel 2007, however, doesn’t provide these functions. Instead, I show you 
a couple of workarounds that enable you to calculate standard deviations 
conditionally.
The workarounds filter out data that meet a set of conditions, and then 
calculate the standard deviation of the filtered data. Figure 5-6 shows what 
I mean. The data are from the fictional psychology experiment I describe in 
Chapter 4.
Here, once again, is the description:
A person sits in front of a screen and a color-filled shape appears. The color 
is either red or green and the shape is either a square or a circle. The combi-
nation for each trial is random, and all combinations appear an equal number 
of times. In the lingo of the field, each appearance of a color-filled shape is 
called a trial. So the worksheet shows the outcomes of 16 trials.
 
Figure 5-6: 
Filtering 
data to 
calculate 
standard 
deviation 
conditionally.
 
The person sitting in front of the screen presses a button as soon as he or she 
sees the shape. Column A presents the trial number. Columns B and C show 
the color and shape, respectively, presented on that trial. Column D (labeled 
RT_msec) presents one person’s reaction time in milliseconds (thousandths 
of a second) for each trial. So, for example, row 2 tells you that on the first trial, 
a red circle appeared and the person responded in 410 msec (milliseconds).
For each column, I defined the name in the top cell of the column to refer 
to the data in that column. If you don’t remember how to do that, reread 
Chapter 2.
Cell D19 displays the overall average of RT_msec. The formula for that aver-
age, of course, is
=AVERAGE(RT_msec)

105
 Chapter 5: Deviating from the Average
Cell D20 shows the average for all trials on which a circle appeared. The for-
mula that calculates that conditional average is
=AVERAGEIF(Shape,”Circle”,RT_msec)
Cell D21 presents the average for trials on which a green square appeared. 
That formula is
=AVERAGEIFS(RT_msec, Color,”Green”, Shape,”Square”)
Columns H and K hold filtered data. Column H shows the data for trials that 
displayed a circle. Cell H19 presents the standard deviation for those trials 
and is the equivalent of
=STDEVIF(Shape,”Circle”,RT_msec)
if this function existed.
Column K shows the data for trials that displayed a green square. Cell K19 
presents the standard deviation for those trials, and is the equivalent of
=STDEVIFS(RT_msec, Color,”Green”,Shape,”Square”)
if that function existed. 
How did I filter the data? I’ll let you in on it in a moment, but first I have to tell 
you about . . . 
A little logic
In order to proceed, you have to know about two of Excel’s logic functions: IF 
and AND. You access them by clicking
Formulas | Logical Functions
and selecting them from the Logical Functions menu.
IF takes three arguments:
 
✓ A logical condition to be satisfied
 
✓ The action to take if the logical condition is satisfied (that is, if the value 
of the logical condition is TRUE)
 
✓ An optional argument that specifies the action to take if the logical 
condition is not satisfied (that is, if the value of the logical condition 
is FALSE)
Figure 5-7 shows the Function Arguments dialog box for IF.

106
Part II: Describing Data 
 
Figure 5-7: 
The 
Function 
Arguments 
dialog box 
for IF.
 
AND can take up to 255 arguments. AND checks to see if all of its arguments 
meet each specified condition — that is, if each condition is TRUE. If they all 
do, AND returns the value TRUE. If not, AND returns FALSE.
Figure 5-8 shows the Function Arguments dialog box for AND.
 
Figure 5-8: 
The 
Function 
Arguments 
dialog box 
for AND.
 
And now, back to the show
In this example, I use IF to set the value of a cell in column H to the corre-
sponding value in column D if the value in the corresponding cell in column C 
is “Circle”. The formula in cell H2 is 
=IF(C2=”Circle”,D2,” “)
If this were a phrase it would be, “If the value in C2 is ‘Circle’, then set the 
value of this cell to the value in D2. If not, leave this cell blank.” Autofilling the 
next 15 cells of column H yields the filtered data in column H in Figure 5-6. 
The standard deviation in cell H19 is the value STDEVIF would have provided.

107
 Chapter 5: Deviating from the Average
 
I could have omitted the third argument (the two double-quotes) without 
affecting the value of the standard deviation. Without the third argument, 
Excel fills in FALSE for cells that don’t meet the condition instead of leaving 
them blank.
I use AND along with IF for the cells in column K. Each one holds the value 
from the corresponding cell in column D if two conditions are true:
 
✓ The value in the corresponding cell in column B is “Green” 
 
✓ The value in the corresponding cell in column C is “Square”
The formula for cell K2 is
=IF(AND(B2=”Green”,C2=”Square”),D2,” “)
If this was a phrase it would be, “If the value in B2 is ‘Green’ and the value in 
C2 is ‘Square’, then set the value of this cell to the value in D2. If not, leave 
this cell blank.” Autofilling the next 15 cells in column K results in the filtered 
data in column K in Figure 5-6. The standard deviation in cell K19 is the value 
STDEVIFS would have provided.
Related Functions
Before we move on, take a quick look at a couple of other variation-related 
worksheet functions.
DEVSQ
DEVSQ calculates the sum of the squared deviations from the mean (without 
dividing by N or by N-1). For these numbers
50, 47, 52, 46, 45
that’s 34, as Figure 5-9 shows.

108
Part II: Describing Data 
 
Figure 5-9: 
The DEVSQ 
dialog box.
 
Average deviation
One more Excel function deals with deviations in a way other than squaring 
them. 
The variance and standard deviation deal with negative deviations by squar-
ing all the deviations before averaging them. How about if we just ignore the 
minus signs? This is called taking the absolute value of each deviation. (That’s 
the way mathematicians say “How about if we just ignore the minus signs?”). 
If we do that for the heights
50, 47, 52, 46, 45
we can put the absolute values of the deviations into a table like Table 5-4.

 Chapter 5: Deviating from the Average
 
In Table 5-4, notice the vertical lines around Deviation in the heading for the 
third column. Vertical lines around a number symbolize its absolute value. 
That is, the vertical lines are the mathematical symbol for “How about if we 
just ignore the minus signs?” 
The average of the numbers in the third column is 2.4. This average is called 
the average absolute deviation, and it’s a quick and easy way to characterize 
the spread of measurements around their mean. It’s in the same units as the 
original measurements. So if the heights are in inches, the absolute average 
deviation is in inches, too.
Like variance and standard deviation, a large average absolute deviation 
signifies a lot of spread. A small average absolute deviation signifies little 
spread. 
 
This statistic is less complicated than variance or standard deviation, but is 
rarely used. Why? For reasons that are (once again) beyond our scope, statis-
ticians can’t use it as the foundation for additional statistics you’ll meet later. 
Variance and standard deviation serve that purpose.
AVEDEV
Excel’s AVEDEV worksheet function calculates the average absolute devia-
tion of a group of numbers. Figure 5-10 shows the AVEDEV dialog box, which 
presents the average absolute deviation for the cells in the indicated range.

I
n my left hand I hold 15 Argentine pesos. In my right, I hold 100 Chilean 
pesos. Which is worth more? Both currencies are called pesos, right? So 
shouldn’t the 100 be greater than the 15? Not necessarily. “Peso” is just word 
magic — a coincidence of names. Each one comes out of a different country, 
and each country has its own economy. To compare the two amounts of 
money, you have to convert each currency into a standard unit. The most 
intuitive standard for us is our own currency. How much is each amount 
worth in dollars and cents? As I write this, 15 Argentine pesos are worth 
more than $4. One hundred Chilean pesos are worth about 15 cents. 
In this chapter, I show you how to use statistics to create standard units. 
Standard units show you where a score stands in relation to other scores in a 
group, and I show you additional ways to determine a score’s standing within 
a group. 
Catching Some Zs
As the previous paragraph shows, a number in isolation doesn’t really tell 
a story. In order to fully understand what a number means, you have to 
consider the process that produced it. In order to compare one number to 
another, they both have to be on the same scale. 
In some cases, like currency conversion, it’s easy to figure out a standard. In 
others, like temperature conversion or conversion into the metric system, a 
formula guides you.

112
Part II: Describing Data 
When it’s not all laid out for you, you can use the mean and the standard 
deviation to standardize scores that come from different processes. The idea 
is to take a set of scores and use its mean as a zero-point and its standard 
deviation as a unit of measure. Then you compare the deviation of each score 
from the mean to the standard deviation. You’re asking “how big is a particu-
lar deviation relative to (something like) an average of all the deviations?”
To do this, you divide the score’s deviation by the standard deviation. In 
effect, you transform the score into another kind of score. The transformed 
score is called a standard score, or a z-score. 
 
The formula for this is
if you’re dealing with a sample, and
if you’re dealing with a population. In either case, x represents the score 
you’re transforming into a z-score. 
Characteristics of z-scores
A z-score can be positive, negative, or zero. A negative z-score represents a 
score that’s less than the mean and a positive z-score represents a score that’s 
greater than the mean. When the score is equal to the mean, its z-score is zero.
When you calculate the z-score for every score in the set, the mean of the 
z-scores is 0, and the standard deviation of the z-scores is 1.
After you do this for several sets of scores, you can legitimately compare 
a score from one set to a score from another. If the two sets have different 
means and different standard deviations, comparing without standardizing is 
like comparing apples with kumquats.
In the examples that follow, I show how to use z-scores to make comparisons.
Bonds versus The Bambino
Here’s an important question that often comes up in the context of serious 
metaphysical discussions: Who is the greatest home run hitter of all time, 

113
 Chapter 6: Meeting Standards and Standings
Barry Bonds or Babe Ruth? Although this is a difficult question to answer, 
one way to get your hands around it is to look at each player’s best season 
and compare the two. Bonds hit 73 home runs in 2001, and Ruth hit 60 in 
1927. On the surface, Bonds appears to be the more productive hitter. 
The year 1927 was very different from 2001, however. Baseball (and every-
thing else) went through huge changes in the intervening years, and player 
statistics reflect those changes. A home run was harder to hit in the 20s than 
in the 00s. Still, 73 versus 60? Hmmm . . .
Standard scores can help us decide whose best season was better. To stan-
dardize, I took the top 50 home run hitters of 1927 and the top 50 from 2001. 
I calculated the mean and standard deviation of each group, and then turned 
Ruth’s 60 and Bonds’s 73 into z-scores. 
The average from 1927 is 12.68 homers with a standard deviation of 10.49. 
The average from 2001 is 37.02 homers with a standard deviation of 9.64. 
Although the means differ greatly, the standard deviations are pretty close.
And the z-scores? Ruth’s is
Bonds’s is
The clear winner in the z-score best-season home run derby is Babe Ruth. 
Period.
Just to show you how times have changed, Lou Gehrig hit 47 home runs in 
1927 (finishing second to Ruth) for a z-score of 3.27. In 2001, 47 home runs 
amounted to a z-score of 1.04. 
Exam scores
Getting away from sports debates, one practical application of z-scores is the 
assignment of grades to exam scores. Based on percentage scoring, instruc-
tors traditionally evaluate a score of 90 points or higher (out of 100) as an A, 
80–89 points as a B, 70–79 points as a C, 60–69 points as a D, and less than 
60 points as an F. Then they average scores from several exams together to 
assign a course grade. 

114
Part II: Describing Data 
Is that fair? Just as a peso from Argentina is worth more than a peso from Chile, 
and a home run was harder to hit in 1927 than in 2001, is a point on one exam 
worth the same as a “point” on another? Like peso, isn’t that just word magic? 
Indeed it is. A point on a difficult exam is, by definition, harder to come by 
than a point on an easy exam. Because points might not mean the same thing 
from one exam to another, the fairest thing to do is convert scores from each 
exam into z-scores before averaging them. That way, you’re averaging num-
bers on a level playing field.
In the courses I teach, I do just that. I often find that a lower numerical score 
on one exam results in a higher z-score than a higher numerical score from 
another exam. For example, on an exam where the mean is 65 and the stan-
dard deviation is 12, a score of 71 results in a z-score of .5. On another exam, 
with a mean of 69 and a standard deviation of 14, a score of 75 is equivalent 
to a z-score of .429. (Yes, it’s like Ruth’s 60 home runs versus Bonds’s 73.) 
Moral of the story: Numbers in isolation tell you very little. You have to 
understand the process that produces them.
STANDARDIZE
Excel’s STANDARDIZE worksheet function calculates z-scores. Figure 6-1 
shows a set of exam scores along with their mean and standard devia-
tion. I used AVERAGE and STDEVP to calculate the statistics. The Function 
Arguments dialog box for STANDARDIZE is also in the figure.

 Chapter 6: Meeting Standards and Standings
Here are the steps:
 
1. Enter the data into an array and select a cell. 
 
 The data are in C2:C32. I selected D2 to hold the z-score for the score 
in C2. Ultimately, I’ll autofill column D and line up all the z-scores next to 
the corresponding exam scores.
 
2. From the Statistical Functions menu, select STANDARDIZE to open the 
Function Arguments dialog box for STANDARDIZE.
 
3. In the Function Arguments dialog box, enter the appropriate values 
for the arguments.
 
 First, I entered the cell that holds the first exam score into the X box. In 
this example, that’s D2. 
 
 In the Mean box, I entered the cell that holds the mean — C33 for this 
example. It has to be in absolute reference format, so the entry is $C$33. 
Caching some z’s
Because negative z-scores might have con-
notations that are, well, negative, educators 
sometimes change the z-score when they 
evaluate students. In effect, they’re hiding the 
z-score, but the concept is the same — stan-
dardization with the standard deviation as the 
unit of measure.
One popular transformation is called the 
T-score. The T-score eliminates negative 
scores because a set of T-scores has a mean 
of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. The idea 
is to give an exam, grade all the tests, and cal-
culate the mean and standard deviation. Next, 
turn each score into a z-score. Then follow this 
formula:
 
 
People who use the T-score often like to round 
to the nearest whole number.
SAT scores are another transformation of the 
z-score. (Some refer to the SAT as a C-score.) 
The SAT has a mean of 500 and a standard devi-
ation of 100. After the exams are graded, and 
their mean and standard deviation calculated, 
each exam score becomes a z-score in the 
usual way. This formula converts the z-score 
into a SAT score:
 
 
Rounding to the nearest whole number is part of 
the procedure here, too.
The IQ score is still another transformed z. Its 
mean is 100 and (in the Stanford-Binet version) 
its standard deviation is 16. What’s the proce-
dure for computing an IQ score? You guessed 
it. In a group of IQ scores, calculate the mean 
and standard deviation, and then calculate the 
z-score. Then it’s 
 
 
As with the other two, IQ scores are rounded to 
the nearest whole number.

116
Part II: Describing Data 
You can type it that way, or you select C33 and then highlight the Mean 
box and press the F4 key.
 
 In the Standard_dev box, I entered the cell that holds the standard devi-
ation. The appropriate cell in this example is C34. This also has to be in 
absolute reference format, so the entry is $C$34.
 
4. Click OK to close the Function Arguments dialog box and put the 
z-score for the first exam score into the selected cell.
To finish up, I positioned the cursor on the selected cell’s autofill handle, 
hold the left mouse button down, and drag the cursor to autofill the remain-
ing z-scores. 
Figure 6-2 shows the autofilled array of z-scores.

Where Do You Stand?
Standard scores are designed to show you how a score stands in relation to 
other scores in the same group. To do this, they use the standard deviation 
as a unit of measure.

117
 Chapter 6: Meeting Standards and Standings
If you don’t want to use the standard deviation, you can show a score’s rela-
tive standing in a simpler way. You can determine the score’s rank within the 
group: The highest score has a rank of 1, the second highest has a rank of 2, 
and so on. 
RANK
With Excel’s RANK function you can quickly determine the ranks of all the 
scores in a group. Figure 6-3 shows the Function Arguments dialog box for 
RANK along with a group of scores. I’ve also set up a column for the ranks. 
 
Figure 6-3: 
Working 
with RANK.
 
Here are the steps for using RANK:
 
1. Enter the data into an array and select a cell. 
 
 For this example, I entered the scores into cells C2 through C16, and 
selected cell D2.
 
2. From the Statistical Functions menu select RANK to open the Function 
Arguments dialog box for RANK.
 
3. In the Function Arguments dialog box, type the appropriate values for 
the arguments.
 
 In the Number box, I entered the cell that holds the score whose rank I 
want to insert into the selected cell. For this example, that’s C2. 
 
 In the Ref box, I entered the array that contains the scores. I enter 
C2:C16 into the Ref box.
 
 This part is important. After I insert RANK into D2 I’m going to drag the 
cursor through column D and autofill the ranks of the remaining scores. 
To set up for this, I have to let Excel know I want C2 through C16 to be 
the array for every score, not just the first one. 

118
Part II: Describing Data 
 
 That means the array in the Ref box has to look like this: $C$2:$C$16. I 
can either add the $-signs manually, or highlight the Ref box and then 
press the F4 key.
 
 In the Order box, I indicate the order for sorting the scores. To rank the 
scores in descending order, I can either leave the Order box alone or 
type 0 (zero) into that box. To rank the scores in ascending order, I type 
a non-zero value into the Order box. I left this box alone.
 
4. Click OK to put the rank into the selected cell.
I then position the cursor on the selected cell’s autofill handle, hold the left 
mouse button down, and drag the cursor to autofill the ranks of the remain-
ing scores. (See Figure 6-4.)
 
Figure 6-4: 
The auto-
filled ranks.
 
LARGE and SMALL
You can turn the ranking process inside out by supplying a rank and asking 
which score has that rank. The worksheet functions LARGE and SMALL 
handle this from either end. They tell you the fifth largest score or the third 
smallest score, or any other rank you’re interested in.
Figure 6-5 shows the Function Arguments dialog box for LARGE. In the Array 
box you enter the array of cells that holds the group of scores. In the K box 
you enter the position whose value you want to find. To find the seventh larg-
est score in the array, for example, type 7 into the K box. 
SMALL does the same thing, except it finds score positions from the lower 
end of the group. The Function Arguments dialog box for SMALL also has an 
Array box and a K box. Entering 7 in this K box returns the seventh lowest 
score in the array.

PERCENTILE and PERCENTRANK
Closely related to rank is the percentile, which represents a score’s standing 
in the group as the percent of scores below it. If you’ve taken standardized 
tests like the SAT, you’ve encountered percentiles. An SAT score in the 80th 
percentile is higher than 80 percent of the other SAT scores.
Excel’s PERCENTILE function enables you to find the value at any percentile. 
Figure 6-6 shows the Function Arguments dialog box PERCENTILE. The dialog 
box shows the 75th percentile (the value that’s greater than 75 percent of 
the scores) for the numbers in cells C2 through C16. In this example, the 75th 
percentile is 72.5.
 
Figure 6-6: 
The 
Function 
Arguments 
dialog 
box for 
PERCENT-
ILE. 
 
 
In the PERCENTILE dialog box, you enter the percentile into the K box. Enter it 
as a decimal, so that the 75th percentile is .75.

120
Part II: Describing Data 
In contrast to percentiles, you might be interested in the flip side: Given a 
value, what percent of scores falls below it? PERCENTRANK handles this. In 
Figure 6-7 the Function Arguments dialog box for PERCENTRANK shows the 
percent rank of 65 for the scores in cells C2 through C16. (It’s 0.642, or 64.2 
percent.) The Array box holds the array of cells and the X box holds the score 
(65). The Significance box is optional: You can enter the amount of significant 
figures in which you would like the answer to appear, or you can leave it blank.
 
Figure 6-7: 
The 
Function 
Arguments 
dialog 
box for 
PERCENT-
RANK. 
 
Drawn and quartiled
A few specific percentiles are often used to 
summarize a group of scores. The median— 
the 50th percentile (because it’s higher than 50 
percent of the scores) — is one of them. Three 
others are the 25th percentile, the 75th and the 
100th percentile (the maximum score). Because 
they divide a group of scores into fourths, these 
particular four percentiles are called quartiles. 
Excel’s QUARTILE function calculates them. 
Selecting QUARTILE from the Insert Function 
dialog box opens the QUARTILE dialog box 
shown in the figure.
The trick is to enter the right kind of numbers 
into the Quart box — 1 for the 25th percentile, 
2 for the 50th, 3 for the 75th, and 4 for the 100th. 
Entering 0 into the Quart box gives you the 
lowest score in the group.

121
 Chapter 6: Meeting Standards and Standings
 
For the X box, you can enter either the value of a score or the label of the 
cell in which it appears. In this example, C10 in the X box gives you the same 
result as putting 65 in the X box.
Data analysis tool: Rank and Percentile
As the name of this section indicates, Excel provides a data analysis tool 
that calculates ranks and percentiles of each score in a group. The Rank and 
Percentiles tool calculates both at the same time, so it saves you some steps 
versus using the separate worksheet functions. (See Chapter 2 to install 
Excel’s data analysis tools.) In Figure 6-8, I take the exam scores from the 
z-score example and open the Rank and Percentile dialog box. 
 
Figure 6-8:

Here are the steps for using Rank and Percentile:
 
1. Type your data into an array.
 
 In this example, the data are in cells C2 through C32. 
 
2. In the Tools menu, choose Data Analysis to open the Data Analysis 
dialog box.
 
3. In the Data Analysis dialog box, select Rank and Percentile.
 
4. Click OK to open the Rank and Percentile dialog box.

122
Part II: Describing Data 
 
5. In the Rank and Percentile dialog box, enter the data array into the 
Input Range box. Make sure that it’s in absolute reference format.
 
 In this example, a label is in the first row (in cell C1). I want the label 
included in the output, so I enter $C$1:$C$32 in the Input Range box, 
and I check the Labels in First Row checkbox.
 
6. Click the Columns radio button to indicate that the data are organized 
by columns.
 
7. Click the New Ply radio button to create a new tabbed page in the 
worksheet, and to send the results to the newly created page.
 
8. Click OK to close the dialog box. Open the newly created page to see 
the results.
Figure 6-9 shows the new page with the results. The table orders the scores 
from highest to lowest, as the Score column shows along with the Rank 
column. The Point column tells you the score’s position in the original group-
ing. For example, the 98 in cell B2 is the 12th score in the original data. The 
Percent column gives the percentile for each score.

easures of central tendency and variability are excellent ways of sum-
marizing a set of scores. They aren’t the only ways. Central tendency 
and variability make up a subset of descriptive statistics. Some descriptive 
statistics are intuitive — like count, maximum, and minimum. Some are not — 
like skewness and kurtosis. 
In this chapter, I discuss descriptive statistics, and I show you Excel’s capa-
bilities for calculating them and visualizing them.
Counting Out
The most fundamental descriptive statistic I can imagine is the number of 
scores in a set of scores. Excel offers five ways to determine that number. 
Yes, five ways. Count them.
COUNT, COUNTA, COUNTBLANK, 
COUNTIF, COUNTIFS
Given an array of cells, COUNT gives you the amount of those cells that 
contain numerical data. Figure 7-1 shows that I’ve entered a group of scores, 
selected a cell to hold COUNT’s result, and opened the Function Arguments 
dialog box for COUNT. Here are the steps:

1. Enter your data into the worksheet and select a cell for the result. 
 
 I entered data into columns C, D, and E to show off COUNT’s multi-argu-
ment capability. I selected cell C14 to hold the count.
 
2. From the Statistical Functions menu, select COUNT and click OK to 
open the Function Arguments dialog box for COUNT. 
 
3. In the Function Arguments dialog box, enter the appropriate values 
for the arguments.
 
 In the Number1 box I entered one of the data columns for this example, 
like C1:C12. 
 
 I clicked in the Number2 box and entered another data column. I entered 
D1:D6. 
 
 I clicked in the Number3 box and entered the last column, which in this 
example is E1:E2.
 
4. Click OK to put the result in the selected cell.
COUNTA works like COUNT, except that its tally includes cells that contain 
text and logical values in its tally. 
COUNTBLANK counts the number of blank cells in an array. In Figure 7-2, 
I use the numbers from the preceding example, but I extend the array to 
include cells D7 through D12 and E3 through E12. The array in the Range box 
is C1:E12. The Argument Functions dialog box for COUNTBLANK shows the 
number of blank cells (16 for this example).

rion. Figure 7-3 reuses the data once again, showing the Arguments Function 
dialog box for COUNTIF. Although the range is C1:E12, COUNTIF doesn’t 
include blank cells. 
 
Figure 7-3: 
COUNTIF 
tallies the 
amount of 
cells whose 
data meet 
a specified 
criterion.
 
The criterion I used, >= 89, tells COUNTIF to count only the cells whose 
values are greater than or equal to 89. For this example, that count is 1.
 
This probably won’t make much difference as you use this function, but a 
little quirk of Excel shows up here. If you put double quotes around the cri-
terion, the result appears in the dialog box before you click OK. If you don’t, 
it doesn’t. If you click OK without quoting, Excel supplies the quotes and the 
result appears in the selected cell, and Excel applies the quotes. 
COUNTIFS is new in Excel 2007. This function can use multiple criteria to 
determine the count. If the criteria come from two arrays, they must have 
the same number of cells. This is because COUNTIFS counts pairs of cells. It 
includes a pair of cells in the count if one of the cells meets a criterion and 
the other meets a criterion. Take a look at Figure 7-4.

126
Part II: Describing Data 
 
Figure 7-4: 
Working 
with 
COUNTIFS.
 
In this example, COUNTIFS operates in C1:C6 and D1:D6. The criterion for the 
cells in column C is >=40. The criterion for the cells in column D is >50. This 
means that COUNTIFS counts cell-pairs whose C cell holds a value greater 
than or equal to 40 and whose D cell holds a value greater than 50. Only two 
cell-pairs meet these conditions, as the dialog box shows.
You can use a cell range more than once in COUNTIFS. For example
=COUNTIFS(C1:C12,”>30”,C1:C12,”<60”)
gives the number of cells in which the value is between 30 and 60 (not includ-
ing 30 and 60).
The Long and Short of It
Two more descriptive statistics that probably require no introduction are the 
maximum and the minimum. These, of course, are the largest value and the 
smallest value in a group of scores. 
MAX, MAXA, MIN, and MINA 
Excel has worksheet functions that determine a group’s largest and smallest 
values. I show you what MAX is all about. The others work in a similar fashion.
Figure 7-5 reuses the scores from the preceding examples. I selected a cell to 
hold their maximum value, and opened the Function Arguments dialog box 
for MAX. Here are the steps:

127
 Chapter 7: Summarizing It All
 
Figure 7-5: 
The 
Function 
Arguments 
dialog box 
for MAX.
 
 
1. Type your data into the worksheet and select a cell to hold the result. 
 
 I entered data into columns C, D, and E to show off MAX’s multi-argu-
ment capability. For this example, I selected cell C14.
 
2. From the Statistical Functions menu select MAX to open the Function 
Arguments dialog box for MAX. 
 
3. In the Function Arguments dialog box, enter the appropriate values 
for the arguments. 
 
 In the Number1 box, I entered one of the data columns, C1:C12. 
 
 Clicking the Number2 box creates and opens the Number3 box. In the 
Number2 box, I entered another array, D1:D6. 
 
 I clicked in the Number3 box and entered the last array, E1:E2.
 
4.  Click OK to put the result in the selected cell.
MAX ignores any text or logical values it encounters along the way. MAXA 
takes text and logical values into account when it finds the maximum. If 
MAXA encounters the logical value TRUE, it converts that value to 1. MAXA 
converts FALSE, or any text other than “TRUE”, to 0. 
MIN and MINA work the same way as MAX and MAXA, except that they find 
the minimum rather than the maximum. Take care when you use MINA, 
because the conversions of logical values and text to 0 and 1 influence the 
result. With the numbers in the preceding example, the minimum is 22. If you 
enter FALSE or other text into a cell in any of the arrays, MINA gives 0 as the 
minimum. If you enter TRUE, MINA gives 1 as the minimum.

128
Part II: Describing Data 
Getting Esoteric
In this section, I discuss some little-used statistics that are related to the 
mean and the variance. For most people, the mean and the variance are 
enough to describe a set of data. These other statistics, skewness and kurto-
sis, go just a bit further. You might use them someday if you have a huge set 
of data and you want to provide some in-depth description.
Think of the mean as locating a group of scores by showing you where their 
center is. This is the starting point for the other statistics. With respect to the 
mean
 
✓ The variance tells you how spread out the scores are. 
 
✓ Skewness indicates how symmetrically the scores are distributed. 
 
✓ Kurtosis shows you whether or not your scores are distributed with a 
peak in the neighborhood of the mean.
 
Skewness and kurtosis are related to the mean and variance in fairly involved 
mathematical ways. The variance involves the sum of squared deviations 
of scores around the mean. Skewness depends on cubing the deviations 
around the mean before you add them all up. Kurtosis takes it all to a higher 
power — the fourth power, to be exact. I get more specific in the subsections 
that follow.
SKEW
Figure 7-6 shows three histograms. The first is symmetric, the other two are 
not. The symmetry and the asymmetry are reflected in the skewness statistic. 
For the symmetric histogram, the skewness is 0. For the second histogram — 
the one that tails off to the right — the value of the skewness statistic is posi-
tive. It’s also said to be skewed to the right. For the third histogram (which 
tails off to the left), the value of the skewness statistic is negative. It’s also 
said to be skewed to the left.
 
Where do zero, positive, and negative skew come from? They come from this 
formula:
In the formula,  is the mean of the scores, N is the number of scores, and s 
is the standard deviation.

129
 Chapter 7: Summarizing It All
 
Figure 7-6: 
Three his-
tograms 
showing 
three kinds 
of skew-
ness.
 
Symmetric: Skewness = 0 
Skewed to the right: Skewness is positive 
Skewed to the left: Skewness is negative 
I include this formula for completeness. If you’re ever concerned with skew-
ness, you probably won’t use this formula anyway because Excel’s SKEW 
function does the work for you. 
To use SKEW:
 
1. Type your numbers into a worksheet and select a cell for the result. 
 
 For this example, I’ve entered scores into the first ten rows of columns 
C, D, E, and F. (See Figure 7-7.) I selected cell I2 for the result.
 
2. From the Statistical Functions menu, select SKEW to open the Function 
Arguments dialog box for SKEW. 
 
3. In the Function Arguments dialog box, type the appropriate values for 
the arguments. 
 
 In the Number1 box, enter the array of cells that holds the data. For this 
example, the array is C1:F10. With the data array entered, the Function 
Arguments dialog box shows the skewness, which for this example is 
negative. 
 
4. Click OK to put the result into the selected cell.

KURT 
Figure 7-8 shows two histograms. The first has a peak at its center, the 
second is flat. The first is said to be leptokurtic. Its kurtosis is positive. The 
second is platykurtic. Its kurtosis is negative. 
 
Figure 7-8: 
Two his-
tograms 
showing 
two kinds of 
kurtosis.
 
Leptokurtic: Kurtosis is positive
Platykurtic: Kurtosis is negative

131
 Chapter 7: Summarizing It All
 
Negative? Wait a second. How can that be? I mentioned earlier that kurtosis 
involves the sum of fourth powers of deviations from the mean. Because four 
is an even number, even the fourth power of a negative deviation is positive. If 
you’re adding all positive numbers, how can kurtosis ever be negative?
Here’s how. The formula for kurtosis is
where  is the mean of the scores, N is the number of scores, and s is the 
standard deviation.
Uh . . . why 3? The 3 comes into the picture because that’s the kurtosis of 
something special called the standard normal distribution. (I discuss the 
normal distribution at length in Chapter 8.) Technically, statisticians refer to 
this formula as kurtosis excess — meaning that it shows the kurtosis in a set 
of scores that’s in excess of the standard normal distribution’s kurtosis. If 
you’re about to ask the question “Why is the kurtosis of the standard normal 
distribution equal to 3?” don’t ask.
This is another formula you’ll probably never use because Excel’s KURT func-
tion takes care of business. Figure 7-9 shows the scores from the preceding 
example, a selected cell, and the Function Arguments dialog box for KURT. 
 
Figure 7-9: 
Using KURT 
to calculate 
kurtosis.
 

132
Part II: Describing Data 
To use KURT:
 
1. Enter your numbers into a worksheet and select a cell for the result. 
 
 For this example, I entered scores into the first ten rows of columns C, 
D, E, and F. I selected cell I2 for the result.
 
2. From the Statistical Functions menu, select KURT to open the Function 
Arguments dialog box for KURT. 
 
3. In the Function Arguments dialog box, enter the appropriate values 
for the arguments. 
 
 In the Number1 box, I entered the array of cells that holds the data. 
Here, the array is C1:F10. With the data array entered, the Function 
Arguments dialog box shows the kurtosis, which for this example is 
negative. 
 
4. Click OK to put the result into the selected cell.
Tuning In the Frequency
Although the calculations for skewness and kurtosis are all well and good, 
it’s helpful to see how the scores are distributed. To do this, you create a fre-
quency distribution, a table that divides the possible scores into intervals and 
shows the number (the frequency) of scores that fall into each interval.
Excel gives you two ways to create a frequency distribution. One is a work-
sheet function, the other is a data analysis tool.
FREQUENCY
I show you the FREQUENCY worksheet function in Chapter 2 when I intro-
duce array functions. Here, I give you another look. In the upcoming example, 
I reuse the data from the skewness and kurtosis discussions so you can see 
what the distribution of those scores looks like.
Figure 7-10 shows the data once again, along with a selected array, labeled 
Frequency. I’ve also added the label Intervals to a column, and in that column 
I put the interval boundaries. Each number in that column is the upper bound 
of an interval. The figure also shows the Function Arguments dialog box for 
FREQUENCY.

133
 Chapter 7: Summarizing It All
 
Figure 7-10: 
Finding the 
frequencies 
in an array 
of cells.
 
This is an array function, so the steps are a bit different from the functions I 
showed you so far in this chapter.
 
1. Enter the scores into an array of cells.
 
 The array, as in the preceding examples is C1:F10.
 
2. Enter the intervals into an array.
 
 I entered 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 into H2:H7.
 
3. Select an array for the resulting frequencies. 
 
 I put Frequency as the label at the top of column I, so I selected I2 
through I7 to hold the resulting frequencies. 
 
4. From the Statistical Functions menu, select FREQUENCY to open the 
Function Arguments dialog box for FREQUENCY.
 
5. In the Function Arguments dialog box, enter the appropriate values 
for the arguments. 
 
 In the Data_array box I entered the cells that hold the scores. In this 
example, that’s C1:F10. 
 
 FREQUENCY refers to intervals as “bins,” and holds the intervals in the 
Bins_array box. For this example, H2:H7 goes into the Bins_array box. 
 
 After I identified both arrays, the Function Arguments dialog box shows 
the frequencies inside a pair of curly brackets. Look closely at Figure 7-10 
and you see that Excel adds a frequency of zero to the end of the set of 
frequencies.

134
Part II: Describing Data 
 
6. Press Ctrl+Shift+Enter to close the Function Arguments dialog box.
 
 Use this keystroke combination because FREQUENCY is an array function.
When you close the Function Arguments dialog box, the frequencies go into 
the appropriate cells, as Figure 7-11 shows.
 
Figure 7-11: 
FREQUENCY’s 
frequencies.
 
 
If I had assigned the name Data to C1:F10 and the name Interval to H2:H7, and 
used those names in the Function Arguments dialog box, the resulting formula 
would have been 
=FREQUENCY(Data,Interval)
which might be easier to understand than 
=FREQUENCY(C1:F10,H2:H7)
(Don’t remember how to assign a name to a range of cells? Take another look 
at Chapter 2.)
Data analysis tool: Histogram
Here’s another way to create a frequency distribution — with the Histogram 
data analysis tool. To show you that the two methods are equivalent, I use 
the data from the FREQUENCY example. Figure 7-12 shows the data along 
with the Histogram dialog box.
The steps are:
 
1. Enter the scores into an array, and enter intervals into another array.
 
2. Click on Data | Data Analysis to open the Data Analysis dialog box.
 
3. From the Data Analysis dialog box, select Histogram to open the 
Histogram dialog box.

135

4. In the Histogram dialog box, enter the appropriate values. 
 
 The data are in cells C1 through F10, so C1:F10 goes into the Input Range 
box. The easiest way to enter this array is to click on C1, press and 
hold the Shift key, and then click F10. Excel puts the absolute reference 
format ($C$1:$F$10) into the Input Range box. 
 
 In the Bin Range box, I enter the array that holds the intervals. In this 
example, that’s H2 through H7. I click on H2, press and hold the Shift 
key, and then click H7. The absolute reference format ($H$2:$H$7) 
appears in the Bin Range box.
 
5. Click the New Worksheet Ply radio button to create a new tabbed 
page and to put the results on the new page.
 
6. Click the Chart Output checkbox to create a histogram and visualize 
the results. 
 
7. Click OK to close the dialog box.
Figure 7-13 shows Histogram’s output. The table matches up with what 
FREQUENCY produces. Notice that Histogram adds “More” to the Bin column. 
The size of the histogram is somewhat smaller when it first appears. I used 
the mouse to stretch the histogram and give it the appearance you see in the 
figure. The histogram shows that the distribution does tail off to the left (con-
sistent with the negative skewness statistic) and seems to not have a distinc-
tive peak (consistent with the negative kurtosis statistic). 

136

Figure 7-13: 
The 
Histogram 
tool’s out-
put (after I 
stretched 
the chart).
 
By the way, the other checkbox options on the Histogram dialog box are 
Pareto chart and Cumulative percentage. The Pareto chart sorts the inter-
vals in order from highest frequency to lowest before creating the graph. 
Cumulative percentage shows the percentage of scores in an interval com-
bined with the percentages in all the preceding intervals. Checking this box 
also puts a cumulative percentage line in the histogram.
Can You Give Me a Description?
If you’re dealing with individual descriptive statistics, the worksheet func-
tions I’ve discussed get the job done nicely. If you want an overall report that 
presents just about all the descriptive statistical information in one place, 
use the Data Analysis tool I describe in the next section.
Data analysis tool: Descriptive Statistics
In Chapter 2, I show you the Descriptive Statistics tool to introduce Excel’s 
data analysis tools. Here’s a slightly more complex example. Figure 7-14 
shows three columns of scores and the Descriptive Statistics dialog box. I’ve 
labeled the columns First, Second, and Third so you can see how this tool 
incorporates labels. 
Here are the steps for using this tool:
 
1. Enter the data into an array.

137
 Chapter 7: Summarizing It All
 
Figure 7-14: 
The 
Descriptive 
Statistics 
tool at work.
 
 
2. Select Data | Data Analysis to open the Data Analysis dialog box.
 
3. Choose Descriptive Statistics to open the Descriptive Statistics 
dialog box.
 
4. In the Descriptive Statistics dialog box, enter the appropriate values.
 
 In the Input Range box, I enter the data. The easiest way to do this is to 
move the cursor to the upper-left cell (B1), press the Shift key, and click 
the lower-right cell (D9). That puts $B$1:$D$9 into Input Range.
 
5. Click the Columns radio button to indicate that the data are organized 
by columns.
 
6. Check the Labels in First Row checkbox, because the Input Range 
includes the column headings.
 
7. Click the New Worksheet Ply radio button to create a new tabbed 
sheet within the current worksheet, and to send the results to the 
newly created sheet.
 
8. Click the Summary Statistics checkbox, and leave the others 
unchecked.
 
9. Click OK to close the dialog box.
 
 The new tabbed sheet (ply) opens, displaying statistics that summarize 
the data. 
 
 As Figure 7-15 shows, the statistics summarize each column separately. 
When this page first opens, the columns that show the statistic names 
are too narrow, so the figure shows what the page looks like after I wid-
ened the columns.

138
Part II: Describing Data 
 
Figure 7-15: 
The 
Descriptive 
Statistics 
tool’s

The Descriptive Statistics tool gives values for these statistics: mean, stan-
dard error, median, mode, standard deviation, sample variance, kurtosis, 
skewness, range, minimum, maximum, sum, and count. Except for standard 
error and range, I’ve discussed all of them. 
Range is just the difference between the maximum and the minimum. 
Standard error is more involved, and I defer the explanation until Chapter 9. 
For now, I’ll just say that standard error is the standard deviation divided by 
the square root of the sample size and leave it at that.
By the way, one of the checkboxes left unchecked in the example’s Step 6 
provides something called the Confidence Limit of the Mean, which I also 
defer until Chapter 9. The remaining two checkboxes, Kth Largest and Kth 
Smallest, work like the functions LARGE and SMALL.
Instant Statistics 
Suppose you’re working with a cell range full of data. You might like to 
quickly know the status of the average and perhaps some other descrip-
tive statistics about the data without going to the trouble of using several 
Statistical functions. 
You can customize the Status bar at the bottom of the worksheet to track 
these values for you and display them whenever you select the cell range. 
To do this, right-click the status bar to open the Customize Status Bar menu. 
(See Figure 7-16.) In the area second from the bottom, checking all the items 
displays the values I mention in the preceding section (along with the count 
of items in the range — numerical and non-numerical).

Chapter 8
What’s Normal?
In This Chapter
▶ Meet the normal distribution
▶ Standard deviations and the normal distribution
▶ Excel’s normal distribution-related functions
A
 main job of statisticians is to estimate population characteristics. 
The job becomes easier if they can make some assumptions about the 
populations they study.
One particular assumption works over and over again: A specific attribute, 
trait, or ability is distributed throughout a population so that most people 
have an average or near-average amount of the attribute, and progressively 
fewer people have increasingly extreme amounts of the attribute. In this 
chapter, I discuss this assumption and what it means for statistics. I also 
describe Excel functions related to this assumption.
Hitting the Curve
When you measure something in the physical world like length or weight, 
you deal with objects you can see and touch. Statisticians, social scientists, 
market researchers, and businesspeople, on the other hand, often have to 
measure something they can’t see or put their hands around. Traits like 
intelligence, musical ability, or willingness to buy a new product fall into this 
category. 
These kinds of traits are usually distributed throughout the population so 
that most people are around the average — with progressively fewer people 
represented toward the extremes. Because this happens so often, it’s become 
an assumption about how most traits are distributed. 

142
Part II: Describing Data 
It’s possible to capture the most-people-are-about-average assumption in a 
graphic way. Figure 8-1 shows the familiar bell curve that characterizes how a 
variety of attributes are distributed. The area under the curve represents the 
population. The horizontal axis represents measurements of the ability under 
consideration. A vertical line drawn down the center of the curve would cor-
respond to the average of the measurements. 
 
Figure 8-1: 
The Bell 
curve.
 
f(x)
x
So if we assume that it’s possible to measure a trait like intelligence and if 
we assume this curve represents how intelligence is distributed in the popu-
lation, we can say this: The bell curve shows that most people have about 
average intelligence, very few have very little intelligence, and very few are 
geniuses. That seems to fit nicely with our intuitions about intelligence, 
doesn’t it? 
Digging deeper
On the horizontal axis of Figure 8-1 you see x, and on the vertical axis f(x). 
What do these symbols mean? The horizontal axis, as I just mentioned, repre-
sents measurements, so think of each measurement as an x. 

143
 Chapter 8: What’s Normal?
The explanation of f(x) is a little more involved. A mathematical relationship 
between x and f(x) creates the bell curve and enables us to visualize it. The 
relationship is rather complex, and I won’t burden you with it. Just under-
stand that f(x) represents the height of the curve for a specified value of x. 
You supply a value for x (and for a couple of other things), and that complex 
relationship I mentioned returns a value of f(x).
Now for some specifics. The bell curve is formally called the normal distribu-
tion. The term f(x) is called probability density, so the normal distribution is 
an example of a probability density function. Rather than give you a technical 
definition of probability density, I ask you to think of probability density as 
something that turns the area under the curve into probability. Probability 
of . . . what? I discuss that in the next section.
Parameters of a normal distribution
People often speak of the normal distribution. That’s a misnomer. It’s really a 
family of distributions. The members of the family differ from one another in 
terms of two parameters — yes, parameters because I’m talking about popu-
lations. Those two parameters are the mean (μ) and the standard deviation 
(σ). The mean tells you where the center of the distribution is, and the stan-
dard deviation tells you how spread out the distribution is around the mean. 
The mean is in the middle of the distribution. Every member of the normal 
distribution family is symmetric — the left side of the distribution is a mirror 
image of the right.
The characteristics of the normal distribution are well known to statisticians. 
More important, you can apply those characteristics to your work.
How? This brings me back to probability. You can find some useful probabili-
ties if you can do four things:
 
✓ If you can lay out a line that represents the scale of the attribute you’re 
measuring 
 
✓ If you can indicate on the line where the mean of the measurements is
 
✓ If you know the standard deviation
 
✓ If you know (or if you can assume) the attribute is normally distributed 
throughout the population 
I’ll work with IQ scores to show you what I mean. Scores on the Stanford-
Binet IQ test follow a normal distribution. The mean of the distribution of 
these scores is 100 and the standard deviation is 16. Figure 8-2 shows this 
distribution. 

144

tion of IQ

As the figure shows, I’ve laid out a line for the IQ scale. Each point on the 
line represents an IQ score. With 100 (the mean) as the reference point, I’ve 
marked off every 16 points (the standard deviation). I’ve drawn a dotted line 
from the mean up to f(100) (the height of the normal distribution where x = 
100), and a dotted line from each standard deviation point.
The figure also shows the proportion of area bounded by the curve and the 
horizontal axis, and by successive pairs of standard deviations. It also shows 
the proportion beyond 3 standard deviations on either side (52 and 148). Note 
that the curve never touches the horizontal. It gets closer and closer, but it 
never touches. (Mathematicians say the curve is asymptotic to the horizontal.)
So between the mean and one standard deviation — between 100 and 116 — 
are .3413 (or 34.13 percent) of the scores in the population. Another way to 
say this: The probability that an IQ score is between 100 and 116 is .3413. At 
the extremes, in the tails of the distribution, .0013 (.13 percent) of the scores 
are on each side.
 
The proportions in Figure 8-2 hold for every member of the normal distribu-
tion family, not just for Stanford-Binet IQ scores. For example, in a sidebar in 
Chapter 6, I mention SAT scores, which have a mean of 500 and a standard 
deviation of 100. They’re normally distributed, too. That means 34.13 percent 
of SAT scores are between 500 and 600, 34.13 percent between 400 and 500, 
and . . . well, you can use Figure 8-2 as a guide for other proportions.

145
 Chapter 8: What’s Normal?
NORMDIST 
Figure 8-2 only shows areas partitioned by scores at the standard deviations. 
What about the proportion of IQ scores between 100 and 125? Or between 
75 and 91? Or greater than 118? If you’ve ever taken a course in statistics, 
you might remember homework problems that involve finding proportions 
of areas under the normal distribution. You might also remember relying on 
tables of the normal distribution to solve them. 
Excel’s NORMDIST worksheet function enables you to find normal distribu-
tion areas without relying on tables. NORMDIST finds a cumulative area. You 
supply a score, a mean, and a standard deviation for a normal distribution, and 
NORMDIST returns the proportion of area to the left of the score (also called 
cumulative proportion or cumulative probability). For example, Figure 8-2 shows 
that in the IQ distribution .8413 of the area is to the left of 116. 
How did I get that proportion? All the proportions to the left of 100 add up to 
.5000. (All the proportions to the right of 100 add up to .5000, too.) Add that 
.5000 to the .3413 between 100 and 116 and you have .8413.
Restating this another way, the probability of an IQ score less than or equal 
to 116 is .8413.
In Figure 8-3, I use NORMDIST to find this proportion. Here are the steps:
 
1. Select a cell for NORMDIST’s answer.
 
 For this example, I selected C2. 
 
2. From the Statistical Functions menu, select NORMDIST to open the 
Function Arguments dialog box for NORMDIST.
 
3. In the Function Arguments dialog box, enter the appropriate values 
for the arguments.
 
 In the X box, I entered the score for which I want to find the cumulative 
area. In this example, that’s 116.
 
 In the Mean box, I entered the mean of the distribution, and in the 
Standard_dev box, I enter the standard deviation. Here, the mean is 100 
and the standard deviation is 116.
 
 In the Cumulative box, I entered TRUE. This tells NORMDIST to find the

Figure 8-3 shows that the cumulative area is .84134476 (in the dialog box). If 
you enter FALSE in the Cumulative box, NORMDIST returns the height of the 
normal distribution at 116.

To find the proportion of IQ scores greater than 116, subtract the result from 
1.0. (Just for the record, that’s .15865524.)
How about the proportion of IQ scores between 116 and 125? Apply NORMDIST 
for each score and subtract the results. For this particular example, the for-
mula is
=NORMDIST(125,100,16,TRUE)-NORMDIST(116,100,16,TRUE)
The answer, by the way, is .09957.
NORMINV
NORMINV is the flip side of NORMDIST. You supply a cumulative probability, 
a mean, and a standard deviation, and NORMINV returns the score that cuts 
off the cumulative probability. For example, if you supply .5000 along with a 
mean and a standard deviation, NORMINV returns the mean. 
This function is useful if you have to calculate the score for a specific per-
centile in a normal distribution. Figure 8-4 shows the Function Arguments 
dialog box for NORMINV with .75 as the cumulative probability, 500 as the 
mean, and 100 as the standard deviation. Because the SAT follows a normal 
distribution with 500 as its mean and 100 as its standard deviation, the result 
corresponds to the score at the 75th percentile for the SAT. (For more on 
percentiles, see Chapter 6.)

A Distinguished Member of the Family
To standardize a set of scores so that you can compare them to other sets of 
scores, you convert each one to a z-score. (See Chapter 6.) The formula for 
converting a score to a z-score (also known as a standard score) is:
The idea is to use the standard deviation as a unit of measure. For example, 
the Stanford-Binet version of the IQ test has a mean of 100 and a standard 
deviation of 16. The Wechsler version has a mean of 100 and a standard 
deviation of 15. How does a Stanford-Binet score of, say, 110, stack up against 
a Wechsler score of 110? 
An easy way to answer this question is to put the two versions on a level 
playing field by standardizing both scores. For the Stanford-Binet
For the Wechsler
So 110 on the Wechsler is a slightly higher score than 110 on the Stanford-Binet.
Now, if you convert all the scores in a normal distribution (such as either ver-
sion of the IQ), you have a normal distribution of z-scores. Any set of z-scores 

148
Part II: Describing Data 
(normally distributed or not) has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. If 
a normal distribution has those parameters it’s a standard normal distribution — 
a normal distribution of standard scores. 
 
This is the member of the normal distribution family that most people have 
heard of. It’s the one they remember most from statistics courses, and it’s the 
one that most people are thinking about when they say the normal distribu-
tion. It’s also what people think of when they hear z-scores. This distribution 
leads many to the mistaken idea that converting to z-scores somehow trans-
forms a set of scores into a normal distribution. 
Figure 8-5 shows the standard normal distribution. It looks like Figure 8-2, 
except that I’ve substituted 0 for the mean and standard deviation units in 
the appropriate places.

In the next two sections, I describe Excel’s functions for working with the 
standard normal distribution.
NORMSDIST 
NORMSDIST is like its counterpart NORMDIST, except that it’s designed for 
a normal distribution whose mean is 0 and whose standard deviation is 1.00. 

149
 Chapter 8: What’s Normal?
You supply a z-score and it returns the area to the left of the z-score — the 
probability that a z-score is less than or equal to the one you supplied.
Figure 8-6 shows the Function Arguments dialog box with 1 as the z-score. 
The dialog box presents .841344746, the probability that a z-score is less 
than or equal to 1.00 in a standard normal distribution. Clicking OK puts that 
result into a selected cell.
 
Figure 8-6: 
Working 
with 
NORMSDIST.
 
NORMSINV
NORSMINV is the flip side of NORMSDIST. You supply a cumulative probabil-
ity and NORMSINV returns the z-score that cuts off the cumulative probabil-
ity. For example, if you supply .5000, NORMSINV returns 0, the mean of the 
standard normal distribution. 
Figure 8-7 shows the Function Arguments dialog box for NORMSINV, with .75 
as the cumulative probability. The dialog box shows the answer, .67448975, 
the z-score at the 75th percentile of the standard normal distribution.

Part II: Describing Data 
Okay, just because you asked . . . 
The relationship between x and f(x) for the 
normal distribution is, as I mention, a pretty 
complex one. Here’s the equation:
 
 
If you supply values for μ (the mean), σ (the stan-
dard deviation), and x (a score), the equation 
gives you back a value for f(x), the height of the 
normal distribution at x. π and e are important 
constants in mathematics. π is approximately 
3.1416 (the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its 
diameter). e is approximately 2.71828. It’s related 
to something called natural logarithms and to a 
variety of other mathematical concepts. (I tell 
you more about e in Chapter 20.)
In a standard normal distribution, μ = 0 and 
σ = 1, so the equation becomes
 
 
I changed the x to z because you deal with 
z-scores in this member of the normal distribu-
tion family.
In Excel, you can set up a range of cells that 
contain standard scores, create a formula that 
captures the preceding equation, and autofill 
another range of cells with the formula results. 
Next, select the range with the formula results. 
Then you can select 
 
 Insert | Line 
from the Chart area on the Ribbon and choose 
the Line with Markers layout. (See Chapter 2.) 
As the accompanying figure shows, this layout 
nicely traces out the standard normal distri-
bution. The figure also shows the autofilled 
values.

151
 Chapter 8: What’s Normal?
The Formula Bar shows the Excel formula 
that corresponds to the normal distribution 
equation: 
=((1/SQRT(2*PI())))*
EXP(-(B2^2)/2)
PI() is an Excel function that gives the value 
of π. The function EXP() raises e to the power 
indicated by what’s in the parentheses that 
follow it.
I show you all of this because I want you to 
see the equation of the normal distribution as 
an Excel formula. The NORMDIST worksheet 
function offers a much easier way to supply the 
f(z) values. Enter this formula into C2
=NORMDIST(B2,0,1,FALSE)
autofill column C and you have the same values 
as in the figure.

In this part . . .
P
art III deals with using statistical methods to make 
inferences about data. This is all aimed at using the 
data from samples to draw conclusions about popula-
tions, and it’s the essence of statistical analysis. I begin 
with the extremely important concept of sampling distri-
butions. I move on to estimation and confidence limits 
and then to statistical tests geared at one sample, two 
samples, and more. Part III ends with discussions of 
regression and correlation — the statistics of relationships. 
The statistical methods in this part are computationally 
intensive. Fortunately, Excel has specialized features 
for doing the calculations. The seven chapters in this 
part describe Excel functions and tools for inferential 
statistics.

Chapter 9
The Confidence Game: Estimation
In This Chapter
▶ Introducing sampling distributions
▶ Understanding standard error
▶ Simulating the sampling distribution of the mean
▶ Attaching confidence limits to estimates
P
opulations and samples are pretty straightforward ideas. A popula-
tion is a huge collection of individuals, from which you draw a sample. 
Assess the members of the sample on some trait or attribute, calculate statis-
tics that summarize that sample, and you’re in business. 
In addition to summarizing the scores in the sample, you can use the sta-
tistics to create estimates of the population parameters. This is no small 
accomplishment. On the basis of a small percentage of individuals from the 
population, you can draw a picture of the population. 
A question emerges, however: How much confidence can you have in the 
estimates you create? In order to answer this, you have to have a context in 
which to place your estimates. How probable are they? How likely is the true 
value of a parameter to be within a particular lower bound and upper bound?
In this chapter, I introduce the context for estimates, show how that plays 
into confidence in those estimates, and describe an Excel function that 
enables you to calculate your confidence level.
What is a Sampling Distribution?
Imagine that you have a population, and you draw a sample from this popula-
tion. You measure the individuals of the sample on a particular attribute and 
calculate the sample mean. Return the sample members to the population. 
Draw another sample, assess the new sample’s members, and then calcu-
late their mean. Repeat this process again and again, always using the same 
number of individuals as you had in the original sample. If you could do this 
an infinite amount of times (with the same-size sample each time), you’d have 

156
Part III: Drawing Conclusions from Data 
an infinite amount of sample means. Those sample means form a distribution 
of their own. This distribution is called the sampling distribution of the mean. 
For a sample mean, this is the context I mention at the beginning of this chap-
ter. Like any other number, a statistic makes no sense by itself. You have to 
know where it comes from in order to understand it. Of course, a statistic 
comes from a calculation performed on sample data. In another sense, a sta-
tistic is part of a sampling distribution. 
 
In general, a sampling distribution is the distribution of all possible values of a 
statistic for a given sample size. 
I italicize that definition for a reason: It’s extremely important. After many years 
of teaching statistics, I can tell you that this concept usually sets the boundary 
line between people who understand statistics and people who don’t. 
So . . . if you understand what a sampling distribution is, you’ll understand what 
the field of statistics is all about. If you don’t, you won’t. It’s almost that simple. 
If you don’t know what a sampling distribution is, statistics will be a cook-
book type of subject for you: Whenever you have to apply statistics, you’ll 
plug numbers into formulas and hope for the best. On the other hand, if 
you’re comfortable with the idea of a sampling distribution, you’ll grasp the 
big picture of inferential statistics.
To help clarify the idea of a sampling distribution, take a look at Figure 9-1. It 
summarizes the steps in creating a sampling distribution of the mean.

 Chapter 9: The Confidence Game: Estimation
A sampling distribution — like any other group of scores — has a mean and a 
standard deviation. The symbol for the mean of the sampling distribution of 
the mean (yes, I know that’s a mouthful) is 
. 
 
The standard deviation of a sampling distribution is a pretty hot item. It has a 
special name — standard error. For the sampling distribution of the mean, the 
standard deviation is called the standard error of the mean. Its symbol is 
. 
An EXTREMELY Important Idea: 
The Central Limit Theorem 
The situation I ask you to imagine is one that never happens in the real 
world. You never take an infinite amount of samples and calculate their 
means, and you never create a sampling distribution of the mean. Typically, 
you draw one sample and calculate its statistics. 
So if you have only one sample how can you ever know anything about a sam-
pling distribution — a theoretical distribution that encompasses an infinite 
number of samples? Is this all just a wild-goose chase?
No, it’s not. You can figure out a lot about a sampling distribution because of 
a great gift from mathematicians to the field of statistics. This gift is called the 
Central Limit Theorem.
 
According to the Central Limit Theorem
 
✓ The sampling distribution of the mean is approximately a normal distri-
bution if the sample size is large enough. 
 
 Large enough means about 30 or more.
 
✓ The mean of the sampling distribution of the mean is the same as the 
population mean. 
 
 In equation form that’s 
 
✓ The standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the mean (also 
known as the standard error of the mean) is equal to the population 
standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size. 
 
 The equation here is
Notice that the Central Limit theorem says nothing about the population. All 
it says is that if the sample size is large enough, the sampling distribution of 

158
Part III: Drawing Conclusions from Data 
the mean is a normal distribution, with the indicated parameters. The popu-
lation that supplies the samples doesn’t have to be a normal distribution for 
the Central Limit Theorem to hold. 
What if the population is a normal distribution? In that case, the sampling dis-
tribution of the mean is a normal distribution regardless of the sample size.
Figure 9-2 shows a general picture of the sampling distribution of the mean, 
partitioned into standard error units.

Simulating the Central Limit Theorem
It almost doesn’t sound right. How can a population that’s not normally dis-
tributed result in a normally distributed sampling distribution?
To give you an idea of how the Central Limit Theorem works, I created a 
simulation. This simulation creates something like a sampling distribution of 
the mean for a very small sample, based on a population that’s not normally 
distributed. As you’ll see, even though the population is not a normal distri-
bution, and even though the sample is small, the sampling distribution of the 
mean looks quite a bit like a normal distribution.

159
 Chapter 9: The Confidence Game: Estimation
Imagine a huge population that consists of just three scores — 1, 2, and 3 
and each one is equally likely to appear in a sample. (That kind of population 
is definitely not a normal distribution.) Imagine also that you can randomly 
select a sample of three scores from this population. Table 1 shows all the 
possible samples and their means.

If you look closely at the table, you can almost see what’s about to happen in 
the simulation. The sample mean that appears most frequently is 2.00. The 
sample means that appear least frequently are 1.00 and 3.00. Hmmm . . . 
In the simulation, I randomly select a score from the population, and then ran-
domly select two more. That group of three scores is a sample. Then I calculate 
the mean of that sample. I repeat this process for a total of 60 samples, result-
ing in 60 sample means. Finally, I graph the distribution of the sample means.
What does the simulated sampling distribution of the mean look like? Figure 
9-3 shows a worksheet that answers that question.
In the worksheet, each row is a sample. The columns labeled x1, x2, and x3 
show the three scores for each sample. Column G shows the average for the 
sample in each row. Column I shows all the possible values for the sample 
mean, and column J shows how often each mean appears in the 60 samples. 
Columns I and J, and the graph, show that the distribution has its maximum 
frequency when the sample mean is 2.00. The frequencies tail off as the 
sample means get farther and farther away from 2.00.

Figure 9-3:

of the mean 
(N=3) from a 
population 
consist-
ing of the 
scores 1, 2, 
and 3. The 
simulation 
consists of 
60 samples.
 
The point of all this is that the population looks nothing like a normal distri-
bution and the sample size is very small. Even under those constraints, the 
sampling distribution of the mean based on 60 samples begins to look very 
much like a normal distribution.
What about the parameters the Central Limit Theorem predicts for the sam-
pling distribution? Start with the population. The population mean is 2.00, the 
population variance is .67, and the population standard deviation is .82. (This 
kind of population requires some slightly fancy mathematics for figuring out 
the parameters. The math is a little beyond where we are, so I’ll leave it at 
that.)
On to the sampling distribution. The mean of the 60 means is 1.91, and their 
standard deviation (an estimate of the standard error of the mean) is .48. 
Those numbers closely approximate the Central Limit Theorem–predicted 
parameters for the sampling distribution of the mean, 2.00 (equal to the pop-
ulation mean) and .47 (the population standard deviation, .82, divided by the 
square root of 3, the sample size). 
In case you’re interested in doing this simulation, here are the steps:
 
1. Select a cell for your first randomly selected number.
 
 I selected cell D2.
 
2. Use the worksheet function RANDBETWEEN to select 1, 2, or 3.
 
 This simulates drawing a number from a population consisting of the 
numbers 1, 2, and 3 where you have an equal chance of selecting each 
number. You can either select Formulas | Math & Trig | RANDBETWEEN 
and use the Function Arguments dialog box, or just type 
=RANDBETWEEN(1,3)

161
 Chapter 9: The Confidence Game: Estimation
 
 in D2 and press Enter. The first argument is the smallest number 
RANDBETWEEN returns, and the second argument is the largest number.
 
3. Select the cell to the right of the original cell and pick another 
random number between one and three. Do this again for a third 
random number in the cell to the right of the second one.
 
 The easiest way to do this is to autofill the two cells to the right of the 
original cell. In my worksheet those two cells are E2 and F2.
 
4. Consider these three cells to be a sample and calculate their mean in 
the cell to the right of the third cell.
 
 The easiest way to do this is just type 
=AVERAGE(D2:F2)
 
 in cell G2 and press Enter.
 
5. Repeat this process for as many samples as you want to include in the 
simulation. Have each row correspond to a sample.
 
 I used 60 samples. The quick and easy way to get this done is to select 
the first row of three randomly selected numbers and their mean, and 
then autofill the remaining rows. The set of sample means in column G 
is the simulated sampling distribution of the mean. Use AVERAGE and 
STDEVP to find its mean and standard deviation.
To see what this simulated sampling distribution looks like, use the array 
function FREQUENCY on the sample means in column G. Follow these steps:
 
1. Enter the possible values of the sample mean into an array.
 
 I used column I for this. I expressed the possible values of the sample 
mean in fraction form (3/3, 4/3, 5/3, 6/3, 7/3, 8/3, and 9/3) as I entered 
them into the cells I3 through I9. Excel converts them to decimal form.
 
2. Select an array for the frequencies of the possible values of the 
sample mean. 
 
 I used column J to hold the frequencies, selecting cells J3 through J9. 
 
3. From the Statistical Functions menu, select FREQUENCY to open the 
Function Arguments dialog box for FREQUENCY.
 
4. In the Function Arguments dialog box, enter the appropriate values 
for the arguments. 
 
 In the Data_array box, I entered the cells that hold the sample means. In 
this example, that’s G2:G61. 
 
5. Identify the array that holds the possible values of the sample mean. 
 
 FREQUENCY holds this array in the Bins_array box. For my worksheet, 
I3:I9 goes into the Bins_array box. After you identify both arrays, the 
Function Arguments dialog box shows the frequencies inside a pair of 
curly brackets. (See Figure 9-4.)

6. Press Ctrl+Shift+Enter to close the Function Arguments dialog box and 
show the frequencies.
 
 Use this keystroke combination because FREQUENCY is an array func-
tion. (For more on FREQUENCY, see Chapter 7.)
Finally, with I3:I9 highlighted, select 
Insert | Column 
and choose the Clustered Column layout to produce the graph of the fre-
quencies. (See Chapter 3.) Your graph will probably look somewhat different 
from mine.
By the way, Excel repeats the random selection process whenever you do 
something that causes Excel to recalculate the worksheet. The effect is that 
the numbers can change as you work through this. For example, if you go 
back and autofill one of the rows again, the numbers change and the graph 
changes.
The Limits of Confidence 
I told you about sampling distributions because they help you answer the 
question I pose at the beginning of this chapter: How much confidence can 
you have in the estimates you create? 
The idea is to calculate a statistic, and then use that statistic to establish 
upper and lower bounds for the population parameter with, say, 95 percent 

163
 Chapter 9: The Confidence Game: Estimation
confidence. You can only do this if you know the sampling distribution of the 
statistic and the standard error. In the next section, I show how to do this for 
the mean.
Finding confidence limits for a mean
The FarBlonJet Corporation, a manufacturer of navigation systems, has 
developed a new battery to power their portable model. To help market their 
system, FarBlonJet wants to know how long, on average, each battery lasts 
before it burns out. 
They’d like to estimate that average with 95 percent confidence. They test 
a sample of 100 batteries, and find that the sample mean is 60 hours, with a 
standard deviation of 20 hours. The Central Limit Theorem, remember, says 
that with a large enough sample (30 or more), the sampling distribution of 
the mean approximates a normal distribution. The standard error of the 
mean (the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the mean) is
The sample size, N, is 100. What about σ? That’s unknown, so you have to 
estimate it. If you know σ, that would mean you know μ, and establishing con-
fidence limits would be unnecessary.
The best estimate of σ is the standard deviation of the sample. In this case 
that’s 20. This leads to an estimate of the standard error of the mean
The best estimate of the population mean is the sample mean, 60. Armed 
with this information, — estimated mean, estimated standard error of the 
mean, normal distribution — you can envision the sampling distribution of 
the mean, which I’ve done in Figure 9-5. Consistent with Figure 9-2, each stan-
dard deviation is a standard error of the mean.
Now that you have the sampling distribution, you can establish the 95 per-
cent confidence limits for the mean. This means that, starting at the center 
of the distribution, how far out to the sides do you have to extend until you 
have 95 percent of the area under the curve? (For more on area under the 
normal distribution and what it means, see Chapter 8.)

One way to answer this question is to work with the standard normal distri-
bution and find the z-score that cuts off 47.5 percent on the right side and 
47.5 percent on the left side (yes, Chapter 8 again). The one on the right is a 
positive z-score, the one on the left is a negative z-score. Then multiply each 
z-score by the standard error. Add each result to the sample mean to get the 
upper confidence limit and the lower confidence limit. 
It turns out that the z-score is 1.96 for the boundary on the right side of the 
standard normal distribution, and –1.96 for the boundary on the left. You 
can calculate those values (difficult), get them from a table of the normal 
distribution that you typically find in a statistics textbook (easier), or use the 
Excel worksheet function I describe in the next section to do all the calcula-
tions (much easier). The point is that the upper bound in the sampling distri-
bution is 63.92 (60 + 1.96
), and the lower bound is 56.08 (60 – 1.96
). Figure 
9-6 shows these bounds on the sampling distribution.
This means you can say with 95 percent confidence that the FarBlonJet 
battery lasts, on the average, between 56.08 hours and 63.92 hours. Want a 
narrower range? You can either reduce your confidence level (to, say, 90 per-
cent) or test a larger sample of batteries.

CONFIDENCE
The CONFIDENCE worksheet function does the lion’s share of the work in 
constructing confidence intervals. You supply the confidence level, the 
standard deviation, and the sample size. CONFIDENCE returns the result of 
multiplying the appropriate z-score by the standard error of the mean. To 
determine the upper bound of the confidence limit, you add that result to the 
sample mean. To determine the lower bound, you subtract that result from 
the sample mean.
To show you how it works, I’ll go through the FarBlonJet batteries example 
again. Here are the steps:
 
1. Select a cell.
 
2. From the Statistical Functions menu, select CONFIDENCE to open the 
Function Arguments dialog box for CONFIDENCE. (See Figure 9-7.)
 
 The Alpha box holds the result of subtracting the desired confidence 
level from 1.00.

 Yes, that’s a little confusing. Instead of typing .95 for the 95 percent 
confidence limit, I have to type .05. Think of it as the percentage of area 
beyond the confidence limits rather than the area within the confidence 
limits. And why is it labeled “Alpha”? I get into that in Chapter 10. 
 
3. In the Standard_dev box, I typed the standard deviation of the sample. 
For this example, the standard deviation is 20.
 
 The Size box holds the number of individuals in the sample. The exam-
ple specifies 100 batteries tested. After I typed that number, the answer 
(3.919928) appears in the dialog box.
 
4. Click OK to put the answer into your selected cell.
To finish things off, I add the answer to the sample mean (60) to determine 
the upper confidence limit (63.92) and subtract the answer from the mean to 
determine the lower confidence limit (56.08).
Fit to a t 
The Central Limit Theorem specifies (approximately) a normal distribution 
for large samples. Many times, however, you don’t have the luxury of large 
sample sizes, and the normal distribution isn’t appropriate. What do you do?
For small samples, the sampling distribution of the mean is a member of a 
family of distributions called the t-distribution. The parameter that distin-
guishes members of this family from one another is called degrees of freedom. 
 
Think of degrees of freedom as the denominator of your variance estimate. For 
example, if your sample consists of 25 individuals, the sample variance that 
estimates population variance is

167
 Chapter 9: The Confidence Game: Estimation
The number in the denominator is 24, and that’s the value of the degrees of 
freedom parameter. In general, degrees of freedom (df) = N– 1 (N is the sample 
size) when you use the t-distribution the way I’m about to in this section.
Figure 9-8 shows two members of the t-distribution family (df =3 and df = 10), 
along with the normal distribution for comparison. As the Figure shows, the 
greater the df, the more closely t approximates a normal distribution.

So to determine the 95 percent confidence level if you have a small sample, 
work with the member of the t-distribution family that has the appropriate 
df. Find the value that cuts off 47.5 percent of the area on the right side of the 
distribution and 47.5 percent of the area on the left side of the distribution. 
The one on the right is a positive value, the one on the left is negative. Then 
multiply each value by the standard error. Add each result to the mean to get 
the upper confidence limit and the lower confidence limit. 
In the FarBlonJet batteries example, suppose the sample consists of 25 bat-
teries, with a mean of 60 and a standard deviation of 20. The estimate for the 
standard error of the mean is
The df = N – 1 = 24. The value that cuts off 47.5 percent of the area on the 
right of this distribution is 2.064, and on the left it’s –2.064. As I said earlier, 
you can calculate these values (difficult), look them up in a table that’s in 
statistics textbooks (easier), or use the Excel function I describe in the next 
section (much easier). 

168
Part III: Drawing Conclusions from Data 
The point is that the upper confidence limit is 68.256 (60 + 2.064
) and the 
lower confidence limit is 51.744 (60 – 2.064). With a sample of 25 batteries, 
you can say with 95 percent confidence that the average life of a FarBlonJet 
battery is between 51.744 hours and 68.256 hours. Notice that with a smaller 
sample, the range is wider for the same level of confidence that I used in the 
previous example.
TINV
Excel’s TINV worksheet function finds the value in the t-distribution that cuts 
off the desired area. Working with it is short and sweet:
 
1. Select a cell.
 
2. From the Statistical Functions menu, select TINV to open the Function 
Arguments dialog box for TINV.
 
3. In the Function Arguments dialog box, enter the appropriate values 
for the arguments.
 
4. In the Probability box, enter the result of subtracting your confidence 
level from 1.00.
 
 As I say in the description of the CONFIDENCE function, that’s a bit con-
fusing. Instead of typing .95 for the 95 percent confidence limit, I typed 
.05 in the Probability box. Think of it as the percentage of area beyond 
the confidence limits rather than the area within the confidence limits. 
 
5. In the Deg_freedom box I type the degrees of freedom. 
 
 For this example, df = 24. The answer appears in the dialog box.
 
6. Click OK to close the dialog box and put the answer in the selected 
cell. (See Figure 9-9.)
 
Figure 9-9: 
The 
Function 
Arguments 
dialog box 
for TINV. 
 

169
 Chapter 9: The Confidence Game: Estimation
You still have to multiply TINV’s answer by the standard error of the mean 
and do the arithmetic to find the upper and lower limits. 
 
I advise against using the CONFIDENCE worksheet function if your sample size 
is less than 30 and if you can’t assume your population is a normal distribu-
tion. Why? CONFIDENCE always assumes a normally distributed sampling 
distribution, and that’s not always appropriate. So if your confidence level is 
95 percent, for example, CONFIDENCE multiplies the standard error by 1.96 
regardless of the sample size. The result is that the confidence interval is too 
narrow for a small sample size.

One-Sample Hypothesis Testing
In This Chapter
▶ Introducing hypothesis tests
▶ Testing hypotheses about means
▶ Testing hypotheses about variances
W
hatever your occupation, you often have to assess whether some-
thing out of the ordinary has happened. Sometimes you start with a 
sample from a population about whose parameters you know a great deal. 
You have to decide whether that sample is like the rest of the population or 
if it’s different. 
Measure that sample and calculate its statistics. Finally, compare those sta-
tistics with the population parameters. Are they the same? Are they different? 
Does the sample represent something that’s off the beaten path? Proper use of 
statistics helps you decide. 
Sometimes you don’t know the parameters of the population you’re dealing 
with. Then what? In this chapter, I discuss statistical techniques and work-
sheet functions for dealing with both cases.
Hypotheses, Tests, and Errors
A hypothesis is a guess about the way the world works. It’s a tentative expla-
nation of some process, whether that process is natural or artificial. Before 
studying and measuring the individuals in a sample, a researcher formulates 
hypotheses that predict what the data should look like. 
Generally, one hypothesis predicts that the data won’t show anything new 
or interesting. Dubbed the null hypothesis (abbreviated H0), this hypothesis 
holds that if the data deviate from the norm in any way, that deviation is due 
strictly to chance. Another hypothesis, the alternative hypothesis (abbrevi-
ated H1), explains things differently. According to the alternative hypothesis, 
the data show something important.

172
Part III: Drawing Conclusions from Data 
After gathering the data, it’s up to the researcher to make a decision. The 
way the logic works, the decision centers around the null hypothesis. The 
researcher must decide to either reject the null hypothesis or to not reject 
the null hypothesis. Hypothesis testing is the process of formulating hypoth-
eses, gathering data, and deciding whether to reject or not reject the null 
hypothesis. 
 
Nothing in the logic involves accepting either hypothesis. Nor does the logic 
entail any decisions about the alternative hypothesis. It’s all about rejecting or 
not rejecting H0. 
Regardless of the reject-don’t-reject decision, an error is possible. One type 
of error occurs when you believe that the data show something important 
and you reject H0, and in reality the data are due just to chance. This is called 
a Type I error. At the outset of a study, you set the criteria for rejecting H0. In 
so doing, you set the probability of a Type I error. This probability is called 
alpha (α)
The other type of error occurs when you don’t reject H0 and the data are 
really due to something out of the ordinary. For one reason or another, you 
happened to miss it. This is called a Type II error. Its probability is called 
beta (β). Table 10-1 summarizes the possible decisions and errors.

sion about H0.
Hypothesis tests and sampling 
 distributions
In Chapter 9, I discuss sampling distributions. A sampling distribution, remem-
ber, is the set of all possible values of a statistic for a given sample size. 

173
 Chapter 10: One-Sample Hypothesis Testing
Also in Chapter 9, I discuss the Central Limit Theorem. This theorem tells 
you that the sampling distribution of the mean approximates a normal dis-
tribution if the sample size is large (for practical purposes, at least 30). This 
holds whether or not the population is normally distributed. If the population 
is a normal distribution, the sampling distribution is normal for any sample 
size. Two other points from the Central Limit Theorem: 
 
✓ The mean of the sampling distribution of the mean is equal to the popu-
lation mean.
 
 The equation for this is
 
✓ The standard error of the mean (the standard deviation of the sampling 
distribution) is equal to the population standard deviation divided by 
the square root of the sample size.
 
 This equation is
x =
N
The sampling distribution of the mean figures prominently into the type of 
hypothesis testing I discuss in this chapter. Theoretically, when you test a 
null hypothesis versus an alternative hypothesis, each hypothesis corre-
sponds to a separate sampling distribution. 
Figure 10-1 shows what I mean. The figure shows two normal distributions. 
I placed them arbitrarily. Each normal distribution represents a sampling 
 distribution of the mean. The one on the left represents the distribution of 
possible sample means if the null hypothesis is truly how the world works. 
The one on the right represents the distribution of possible sample means if 
the alternative hypothesis is truly how the world works. 
Of course, when you do a hypothesis test, you never know which distribution 
produces the results. You work with a sample mean — a point on the hori-
zontal axis. It’s your job to decide which distribution the sample mean is part 
of. You set up a critical value — a decision criterion. If the sample mean is on 
one side of the critical value, you reject H0. If not, you don’t. 
In this vein, the Figure also shows α and β. These, as I mention earlier, are 
the probabilities of decision errors. The area that corresponds to α is in the 
H0 distribution. I shaded it in dark gray. It represents the probability that a 
sample mean comes from the H0 distribution, but it’s so extreme that you 
reject H0.

Where you set the critical value determines α. In most hypothesis testing, you 
set α at .05. This means that you’re willing to tolerate a Type I error (incor-
rectly rejecting H0) 5 percent of the time. Graphically, the critical value cuts off 
5 percent of the area of the sampling distribution. By the way, if you’re talking 
about the 5 percent of the area that’s in the right tail of the distribution (as in 
Figure 10-1), you’re talking about the upper 5 percent. If it’s the 5 percent in 
the left tail you’re interested in, that’s the lower 5 percent.
The area that corresponds to β is in the H1 distribution. I shaded it in light 
gray. This area represents the probability that a sample mean comes from 
the H1 distribution, but it’s close enough to the center of the H0 distribution 
that you don’t reject H0. You don’t get to set β. The size of this area depends 
on the separation between the means of the two distributions, and that’s up 
to the world we live in — not up to you. 
These sampling distributions are appropriate when your work corresponds 
to the conditions of the Central Limit Theorem: if you know the population 
you’re working with is a normal distribution, or if you have a large sample.

175
 Chapter 10: One-Sample Hypothesis Testing
Catching Some Zs Again 
Here’s an example of a hypothesis test that involves a sample from a nor-
mally distributed population. Because the population is normally distributed, 
any sample size results in a normally distributed sampling distribution. 
Because it’s a normal distribution, you use z-scores in the hypothesis test:
One more “because”: Because you use the z-score in the hypothesis test, the 
z-score here is called the test statistic. 
Suppose you think that people living in a particular zip code have higher-
than-average IQs. You take a sample of 16 people from that zip code, give 
them IQ tests, tabulate the results, and calculate the statistics. For the popu-
lation of IQ scores, μ = 100 and σ = 16 (for the Stanford-Binet version).
The hypotheses are:
H0: μZIP code ≤ 100
H1: μZIP code > 100
Assume α = .05. That’s the shaded area in the tail of the H0 distribution in 
Figure 10-1.
Why the ≤ in H0? You use that symbol because you’ll only reject H0 if the 
sample mean is larger than the hypothesized value. Anything else is evidence 
in favor of not rejecting H0.
Suppose the sample mean is 107.75. Can you reject H0?
The test involves turning 107.75 into a standard score in the sampling distri-
bution of the mean:
Is the value of the test statistic large enough to enable you to reject H0 with 
α = .05? It is. The critical value — the value of z that cuts off 5 percent of the 

176
Part III: Drawing Conclusions from Data 
area in a standard normal distribution — is 1.645. (After years of working 
with the standard normal distribution, I happen to know this. Read Chapter 8, 
find out about Excel’s NORMSINV function, and you can have information like 
that at your fingertips, too.) The calculated value, 1.94, exceeds 1.645, so it’s 
in the rejection region. The decision is to reject H0. 
This means that if H0 is true, the probability of getting a test statistic value 
that’s at least this large is less than .05. That’s strong evidence in favor of 
rejecting H0. In statistical parlance, any time you reject H0 the result is said to 
be “statistically significant.”
This type of hypothesis testing is called one-tailed because the rejection 
region is in one tail of the sampling distribution. 
A hypothesis test can be one-tailed in the other direction. Suppose you had 
reason to believe that people in that zip code had lower than average IQ. In 
that case, the hypotheses are:
H0: μZIP code ≥ 100
H1: μZIP code < 100
For this hypothesis test, the critical value of the test statistic is –1.645 if 
α=.05.
A hypothesis test can be two-tailed, meaning that the rejection region is in 
both tails of the H0 sampling distribution. That happens when the hypotheses 
look like this:
H0: μZIP code = 100
H1: μZIP code ≠ 100
In this case, the alternate hypothesis just specifies that the mean is differ-
ent from the null-hypothesis value, without saying whether it’s greater or 
whether it’s less. Figure 10-2 shows what the two-tailed rejection region looks 
like for α = .05. The 5 percent is divided evenly between the left tail (also 
called the lower tail) and the right tail (the upper tail).
For a standard normal distribution, incidentally, the z-score that cuts off 2.5 
percent in the right tail is 1.96. The z-score that cuts off 2.5 percent in the left 
tail is –1.96. (Again, I happen to know these values after years of working with 
the standard normal distribution.) The z-score in the preceding example, 
1.94, does not exceed 1.96. The decision, in the two-tailed case, is to not 
reject H0.

This brings up an important point. A one-tailed hypothesis test can reject H0, 
while a two-tailed test on the same data might not. A two-tailed test indicates 
that you’re looking for a difference between the sample mean and the null-
hypothesis mean, but you don’t know in which direction. A one-tailed test 
shows that you have a pretty good idea of how the difference should come 
out. For practical purposes, this means you should try to have enough knowl-
edge to be able to specify a one-tailed test.
ZTEST 
Excel’s ZTEST worksheet function does the calculations for hypothesis tests 
involving z-scores in a standard normal distribution. You provide sample 
data, a null hypothesis value, and a population standard deviation. ZTEST 
returns the probability in one tail of the H0 sampling distribution. 
This is a bit different from the way things work when you apply the formulas 
I just showed you. The formula calculates a z-score. Then it’s up to you to 
see where that score stands in a standard normal distribution with respect 
to probability. ZTEST eliminates the middleman (the need to calculate the 
z-score) and goes right to the probability.

178
Part III: Drawing Conclusions from Data 
Figure 10-3 shows the data and the Function Arguments dialog box for ZTEST. 
The data are IQ scores for 16 people in the zip code example in the preceding 
section. That example, remember, tests the hypothesis that people in a par-
ticular zip code have a higher than average IQ. 
 
Figure 10-3: 
Data 
and The 
Function 
Arguments 
dialog box 
for ZTEST. 
 
Here are the steps:
 
1. Enter your data into an array of cells and select a cell for the result.
 
 The data in this example are in cells C3 through C18.
 
2. From the Statistical Functions menu, select ZTEST to open the 
Function Arguments dialog box for ZTEST. (See Figure 10-3.)
 
3. In the Function Arguments dialog box, enter the appropriate values 
for the arguments.
 
 In the Array box, I enter the array of cells that hold the data. For this 
example, that’s C3:C18. 
 
 In the X box, type the H0 mean. For this example, the mean is 100— 
the mean of IQ scores in the  population. 
 
 In the Sigma box, type the population standard deviation. The popu-
lation standard deviation for IQ is 16. After typing that number, the 
answer (0.026342) appears in the dialog box.
 
4. Click OK to put the answer into the selected cell.
With α = .05, and a one-tailed test (H1: μ > 100), the decision is to reject H0, 
because the answer (0.026) is less than .05. Note that with a two-tailed test 
(H1: μ ≠ 100), the decision is to not reject H0. That’s because 2 × 0.026 is 
greater than .05 — just barely greater (.052) — but if you draw the line at .05, 
you cannot reject H0.

179
 Chapter 10: One-Sample Hypothesis Testing
t for One
In the preceding example, I worked with IQ scores. The population of IQ 
scores is a normal distribution with a well-known mean and standard devia-
tion. This enabled me to work with the Central Limit Theorem and describe 
the sampling distribution of the mean as a normal distribution. I was then 
able to use z as the test statistic.
In the real world, however, you typically don’t have the luxury of working 
with such well-defined populations. You usually have small samples, and 
you’re typically measuring something that isn’t as well known as IQ. The 
bottom line is that you often don’t know the population parameters, nor do 
you know whether or not the population is normally distributed.
When that’s the case, you use the sample data to estimate the population 
standard deviation, and you treat the sampling distribution of the mean as a 
member of a family of distributions called the t-distribution. You use t as a test 
statistic. In Chapter 9, I introduce this distribution, and mention that you dis-
tinguish members of this family by a parameter called degrees of freedom (df). 
The formula for the test statistic is
Think of df as the denominator of the estimate of the population variance. 
For the hypothesis tests in this section, that’s N-1, where N is the number of 
scores in the sample. The higher the df, the more closely the t-distribution 
resembles the normal distribution. 
Here’s an example. FarKlempt Robotics, Inc., markets microrobots. They 
claim their product averages four defects per unit. A consumer group 
believes this average is higher. The consumer group takes a sample of 9 
FarKlempt microrobots and finds an average of 7 defects, with a standard 
deviation of 3.16. The hypothesis test is:
H0: μ ≤ 4
H1: μ > 4
α = .05

180
Part III: Drawing Conclusions from Data 
The formula is:
Can you reject H0? The Excel function in the next section tells you.
TDIST 
You use the worksheet function TDIST to decide whether or not your calcu-
lated t value is in the region of rejection. You supply a value for t, a value for 
df, and determine whether the test is one-tailed or two-tailed. TDIST returns 
the probability of obtaining a t value at least as high as yours if H0 is true. If 
that probability is less than your α, you reject H0.
The steps are:
 
1. Select a cell to store the result.
 
2. From the Statistical Functions menu, select TDIST to open the Function 
Arguments dialog box for TDIST. (See Figure 10-4.)
 
Figure 10-4: 
The 
Function 
Arguments 
dialog box 
for TDIST. 
 
 
3. In the Function Arguments dialog box, enter the appropriate values 
for the arguments. 
 
 The calculated t value goes in the X box. For this example, the calculated 
t value is 2.85.
 
 The degrees of freedom go in the Deg_freedom box. The degrees of free-
dom for this example is 8 (9 scores – 1).

181
 Chapter 10: One-Sample Hypothesis Testing
 
 In the Tails box, the idea is to type 1 (for a one-tailed test) or 2 (for a 
two-tailed test). In this example, it’s a one-tailed test. After I typed 1, the 
dialog box shows the probability in the tail of the t-distribution beyond 
the t value. 
 
4. Click OK to close the dialog box and put the answer in the selected cell.
The value in the dialog box in Figure 10-4 is less than .05, so the decision is to 
reject H0.
Testing a Variance
So far, I’ve told you about one-sample hypothesis testing for means. You can 
also test hypotheses about variances. 
This sometimes comes up in the context of manufacturing. For example, sup-
pose FarKlempt Robotics, Inc, produces a part that has to be a certain length 
with a very small variability. You can take a sample of parts, measure them, 
find the sample variability and perform a hypothesis test against the desired 
variability.
The family of distributions for the test is called chi-square. Its symbol is χ2. I 
won’t go into all the mathematics. I’ll just tell you that, once again, df is the 
parameter that distinguishes one member of the family from another. Figure 
10-5 shows two members of the chi-square family. 
The formula for this test statistic is
N is the number of scores in the sample, s2 is the sample variance, and σ2 is 
the population variance specified in H0.
With this test, you have to assume that what you’re measuring has a normal 
distribution.
Suppose the process for the FarKlempt part has to have at most a standard 
deviation of 1.5 inches for its length. (Notice I said standard deviation. This 
allows me to speak in terms of inches. If I said variance the units would be 
square inches.). After measuring a sample of 26 parts, you find a standard 
deviation of 1.8 inches.

Can you reject H0? Read on.
CHIDIST 
After calculating a value for your chi-square test statistic, you use the 
CHIDIST worksheet function to make a judgment about it. You supply the 

183
 Chapter 10: One-Sample Hypothesis Testing
 chi-square value and the df, and it tells you the probability of obtaining a 
value at least that high if H0 is true. If that probability is less than your α, 
reject H0.
To show you how it works, I apply the information from the example in the 
preceding section. Follow these steps:
 
1. Select a cell to store the result.
 
2. From the Statistical Functions menu, select CHIDIST to open the 
Function Arguments dialog box for CHIDIST. (See Figure 10-6.)
 
Figure 10-6: 
The 
Function 
Arguments 
dialog box 
for CHIDIST. 
 
 
3. In the Function Arguments dialog box, type the appropriate values for 
the arguments. 
 
 In the X box, I typed the calculated chi-square value. For this example, 
that value is 36.
 
 In the Deg_freedom box, I typed the degrees of freedom. The degrees 
of freedom for this example is 25 (26 – 1). After typing the df, the dialog 
box shows the one-tailed probability of obtaining at least this value of 
chi-square if H0 is true. 
 
4. Click OK to close the dialog box and put the answer in the selected cell.
The value in the dialog box in Figure 10-6 is greater than .05, so the decision 
is to not reject H0. (Can you conclude that the process is within acceptable 
limits of variability? See the nearby sidebar “A point to ponder.”)
CHIINV
CHIINV is the flip side of CHIDIST. You supply a probability and df, and 
CHIINV tells you the corresponding value of chi-square. If you want to know 

184
Part III: Drawing Conclusions from Data 
the value you have to exceed in order to reject H0 in the preceding example, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Select a cell to store the result.
 
2. From the Statistical Functions menu, select CHIINV and click OK to 
open the Function Arguments dialog box for CHIINV. (See Figure 10-7.)
 
Figure 10-7: 
The 
Function

for CHIINV. 
 
 
3. In the Function Arguments dialog box, enter the appropriate values 
for the arguments. 
 
 In the Probability box, I typed .05, the probability I’m interested in for 
this example.
 
 In the Deg_freedom box, I typed the degrees of freedom. The value for 
degrees of freedom in this example is 25 (26 – 1). After I typed the df, 
the dialog box shows the value (37.65248) that cuts off the upper 5 per-
cent of the area in this chi-square distribution. 
 
4. Click OK to close the dialog box and put the answer in the selected cell.
As the dialog box in Figure 10-7 shows, the calculated value (36) didn’t miss 
the cutoff value by much. A miss is still a miss (to paraphrase “As Time Goes 
By”), and you cannot reject H0.

185
 Chapter 10: One-Sample Hypothesis Testing
A point to ponder
Retrace the preceding example. FarKlempt 
Robotics wants to show that its manufactur-
ing process is within acceptable limits of vari-
ability. The null hypothesis, in effect, says the 
process is acceptable. The data do not pres-
ent evidence for rejecting Ho. The value of the 
test statistic just misses the critical value. Does 
that mean the manufacturing process is within 
acceptable limits? 
Statistics are an aid to common sense, not 
a substitute. If the data are just barely within 
acceptability, that should set off alarms.
Usually, you try to reject H0. This is a rare 
case when not rejecting H0 is more desir-
able, because nonrejection implies something 
 positive — the manufacturing process is work-
ing properly. Can you still use hypothesis testing 
techniques in this situation?
Yes, you can — with a notable change. Rather 
than a small value of α, like .05, you choose 
a large value, like .20. This stacks the deck 
against not rejecting H0 — small values of the 
test statistic can lead to rejection. If α is .20 in 
this example, the critical value is 30.6752. (Use 
CHINV to verify that.) Because the obtained 
value, 36, is higher than this critical value the 
decision with this α is to reject H0.
Using a high α is not often done. When the 
desired outcome is to not reject H0, I strongly 
advise it.

I
n business, in education, and in scientific research the need often arises 
to compare one sample with another. Sometimes the samples are inde-
pendent, sometimes they’re matched in some way. Each sample comes from 
a different population. The objective is to decide whether or not the popula-
tions they come from are different from one another. 
Usually, this involves tests of hypotheses about population means. You can 
also test hypotheses about population variances. In this chapter, I show you 
how to carry out these tests. I also discuss useful worksheet functions and 
data analysis tools that help you get the job done.
Hypotheses Built for Two
As in the one-sample case (Chapter 10), hypothesis testing with two samples 
starts with a null hypothesis (H0 ) and an alternative hypothesis (H1). The null 
hypothesis specifies that any differences you see between the two samples 
are due strictly to chance. The alternative hypothesis says, in effect, that any 
differences you see are real and not due to chance. 
It’s possible to have a one-tailed test, in which the alternative hypothesis 
specifies the direction of the difference between the two means, or a two-
tailed test in which the alternative hypothesis does not specify the direction 
of the difference.

188
Part III: Drawing Conclusions from Data 
For a one-tailed test, the hypotheses look like this:
H0: μ1 - μ2 = 0
H1: μ1 - μ2 > 0
or like this:
H0: μ1 - μ2 = 0
H1: μ1 - μ2 < 0
For a two-tailed test, the hypotheses are:
H0: μ1 - μ2 = 0
H1: μ1 - μ2 ≠ 0
The zero in these hypotheses is the typical case. It’s possible, however, to test 
for any value — just substitute that value for zero. 
To carry out the test, you first set α, the probability of a Type I error that 
you’re willing to live with (see Chapter 9). Then you calculate the mean and 
standard deviation of each sample, subtract one mean from the other, and 
use a formula to convert the result into a test statistic. Compare the test sta-
tistic to a sampling distribution of test statistics. If it’s in the rejection region 
that α specifies (see Chapter 10), reject H0. If not, don’t reject H0.
Sampling Distributions Revisited
In Chapter 9, I introduce the idea of a sampling distribution — a distribution 
of all possible values of a statistic for a particular sample size. In that chap-
ter, I describe the sampling distribution of the mean. In Chapter 10, I show its 
connection with one-sample hypothesis testing.
For this type of hypothesis testing, another sampling distribution is neces-
sary. This one is the sampling distribution of the difference between means. 
 
The sampling distribution of the difference between means is the distribution 
of all possible values of differences between pairs of sample means with the 
sample sizes held constant from pair to pair. (Yes, that’s a mouthful.) Held 
constant from pair to pair means that the first sample in the pair always has the 
same size, and the second sample in the pair always has the same size. The 
two sample sizes are not necessarily equal.

189
 Chapter 11: Two-Sample Hypothesis Testing
Within each pair, each sample comes from a different population. All the 
samples are independent of one another, so that picking individuals for one 
sample has no effect on picking individuals for another.
Figure 11-1 shows the steps in creating this sampling distribution. This is 
something you never do in practice. It’s all theoretical. As the figure shows, 
the idea is to take a sample out of one population and a sample out of another, 
calculate their means, and subtract one mean from the other. Return the 
samples to the populations, and repeat over and over and over. The result 
of the process is a set of differences between means. This set of differences 
is the sampling distribution.

Applying the Central Limit Theorem
Like any other set of numbers, this sampling distribution has a mean and a 
standard deviation. As is the case with the sampling distribution of the mean 
(Chapters 9 and 10), the Central Limit Theorem applies here. 
According to the Central Limit Theorem, if the samples are large, the sampling 
distribution of the difference between means is approximately a normal distri-
bution. If the populations are normally distributed, the sampling distribution is 
a normal distribution even if the samples are small.

190
Part III: Drawing Conclusions from Data 
The Central Limit Theorem also has something to say about the mean and 
standard deviation of this sampling distribution. Suppose the parameters for 
the first population are μ1 and σ1, and the parameters for the second popula-
tion are μ2 and σ2. The mean of the sampling distribution is 
The standard deviation of the sampling distribution is
N1 is the number of individuals in the sample from the first population, N2 is 
the number of individuals in the sample from the second. 
 
This standard deviation is called the standard error of the difference between 
means.
Figure 11-2 shows the sampling distribution along with its parameters, as 
specified by the Central Limit Theorem.

Zs once more
Because the Central Limit Theorem says that the sampling distribution is 
approximately normal for large samples (or for small samples from normally 
distributed populations), you use the z-score as your test statistic. Another 
way to say “use the z-score as your test statistic” is “perform a z-test.” Here’s 
the formula:
The term (μ1–μ2) represents the difference between the means in H0.
This formula converts the difference between sample means into a standard 
score. Compare the standard score against a standard normal distribution — 
a normal distribution with μ = 0 and σ = 1. If the score is in the rejection region 
defined by α, reject H0. If it’s not, don’t reject H0.
You use this formula when you know the value of σ1
2 and σ2
2. 
Here’s an example. Imagine a new training technique designed to increase IQ. 
Take a sample of 25 people and train them under the new technique. Take 
another sample of 25 people and give them no special training. Suppose that 
the sample mean for the new technique sample is 107, and for the no-training 
sample it’s 101.2. The hypothesis test is:
H0: μ1 - μ2 = 0
H1: μ1 - μ2 > 0
I’ll set α at .05
The IQ is known to have a standard deviation of 16, and I assume that stan-
dard deviation would be the same in the population of people trained on the 
new technique. Of course, that population doesn’t exist. The assumption is 
that if it did, it should have the same value for the standard deviation as the 
regular population of IQ scores. Does the mean of that (theoretical) popula-
tion have the same value as the regular population? H0 says it does. H1 says 
it’s larger.
The test statistic is

192
Part III: Drawing Conclusions from Data 
With α = .05, the critical value of z — the value that cuts off the upper 5 per-
cent of the area under the standard normal distribution — is 1.645. (You can 
use the worksheet function NORMSINV from Chapter 8 to verify this.) The 
calculated value of the test statistic is less than the critical value, so the deci-
sion is to not reject H0. Figure 11-3 summarizes this.

Data analysis tool: z-Test: 
Two Sample for Means
Excel provides a data analysis tool that makes it easy to do tests like the one 
in the IQ example. It’s called z-Test: Two Sample for Means. Figure 11-4 shows 
the dialog box for this tool along with sample data that correspond to the IQ 
example.

193
 Chapter 11: Two-Sample Hypothesis Testing
 
Figure 11-4: 
The z-Test 
data 
analysis tool 
and data 
from two 
 samples.
 
To use this tool, follow these steps:
 
1. Type the data for each sample into a separate data array.
 
 For this example, the data in the New Technique sample are in column E 
and the data for the No Training sample are in column G.
 
2. Select Data | Data Analysis to open the Data Analysis dialog box.
 
3. In the Data Analysis dialog box, scroll down the Analysis Tools list 
and select z-Test: Two Sample for Means. Click OK to open the z-Test: 
Two Sample for Means dialog box (see Figure 11-4).
 
4. In the Variable 1 Range box, enter the cell range that holds the data 
for one of the samples.
 
 For the example, the New Technique data are in $E$2:$E$27. (Note the 
$-signs for absolute referencing.)
 
5. In the Variable 2 Range box, enter the cell range that holds the data 
for the other sample.
 
 The No Training data are in $G$2:$G$27.
 
6. In the Hypothesized Mean Difference box, type the difference 
between μ1 and μ2 that H0 specifies.
 
 In this example, that difference is 0.
 
7. In the Variable 1 Variance (known) box, type the variance of the first 
sample.
 
 The standard deviation of the population of IQ scores is 16, so this vari-
ance is 256.

194
Part III: Drawing Conclusions from Data 
 
8. In the Variable 2 Variance (known) box, type the variance of the 
second sample.
 
 In this example, this variance is also 256. 
 
9. If the cell ranges include column headings, check the Labels checkbox. 
 
 I included the headings in the ranges, so I checked the box.
 
10. The Alpha box has 0.05 as a default. 
 
  I used the default value, consistent with the value of α in this example.
 
11. In the Output Options, select a radio button to indicate where you 
want the results.
 
 I selected New Worksheet Ply to put the results on a new page in the 
worksheet.
 
12. Click OK.
 
 Because I selected New Worksheet Ply, a newly created page opens with 
the results. 
Figure 11-5 shows the tool’s results, after I expanded the columns. Rows 4, 5, 
and 7 hold values you input into the dialog box. Row 6 counts the number of 
scores in each sample. 
 
Figure 11-5: 
Results of 
the z-Test 
data analy-
sis tool.
 
The value of the test statistic is in cell B8. The critical value for a one-tailed 
test is in B10, and the critical value for a two-tailed test is in B12. 
Cell B9 displays the proportion of area that the test statistic cuts off in one 
tail of the standard normal distribution. Cell B11 doubles that value — it’s the 
proportion of area cut off by the positive value of the test statistic (in the tail 
on the right side of the distribution) plus the proportion cut off by the nega-
tive value of the test statistic (in the tail on the left side of the distribution).

195
 Chapter 11: Two-Sample Hypothesis Testing
t for Two
The example in the preceding section involves a situation you rarely 
 encounter — known population variances. If you know a population’s vari-
ance, you’re likely to know the population mean. If you know the mean, you 
probably don’t have to perform hypothesis tests about it. 
Not knowing the variances takes the Central Limit Theorem out of play. This 
means that you can’t use the normal distribution as an approximation of the 
sampling distribution of the difference between means. Instead, you use the 
t-distribution, a family of distributions I introduce in Chapter 9 and apply to 
one-sample hypothesis testing in Chapter 10. The members of this family of 
distributions differ from one another in terms of a parameter called degrees 
of freedom (df). Think of df as the denominator of the variance estimate you 
use when you calculate a value of t as a test statistic. Another way to say 
 “calculate a value of t as a test statistic”: “Perform a t-test.”
Unknown population variances lead to two possibilities for hypothesis testing. 
One possibility is that although the variances are unknown, you have reason to 
assume they’re equal. The other possibility is that you cannot assume they’re 
equal. In the subsections that follow, I discuss these possibilities.
Like peas in a pod: Equal variances
When you don’t know a population variance, you use the sample variance 
to estimate it. If you have two samples, you average (sort of) the two sample 
variances to arrive at the estimate. 
 
Putting sample variances together to estimate a population variance is called 
pooling. With two sample variances, here’s how you do it:
In this formula sp
2 stands for the pooled estimate. Notice that the denomina-
tor of this estimate is (N1-1) + (N2-1). Is this the df? Absolutely!
The formula for calculating t is

196
Part III: Drawing Conclusions from Data 
On to an example. FarKlempt Robotics is trying to choose between two 
machines to produce a component for its new microrobot. Speed is of the 
essence, so they have each machine produce ten copies of the component, 
and time each production run. The hypotheses are:
H0: μ1-μ2 = 0
H1: μ1-μ2 ≠ 0
They set α at .05. This is a two-tailed test, because they don’t know in 
advance which machine might be faster.
Table 11-1 presents the data for the production times in minutes.

The pooled estimate of σ2 is
The estimate of σ is 2.75, the square root of 7.56.
The test statistic is
For this test statistic, df = 18, the denominator of the variance estimate. In a 
t-distribution with 18 df, the critical value is 2.10 for the right-side (upper) 
tail and –2.10 for the left-side (lower) tail. If you don’t believe me, apply TINV 
(Chapter 9). The calculated value of the test statistic is greater than 2.10, 

197
 Chapter 11: Two-Sample Hypothesis Testing
so the decision is to reject H0. The data provide evidence that Machine 2 is 
significantly faster than Machine 1. (You can use the word “significant” when-
ever you reject H0.)
Like p’s and q’s: Unequal variances
The case of unequal variances presents a challenge. As it happens, when vari-
ances are not equal, the t distribution with (N1-1) + (N2-1) degrees of freedom 
is not as close an approximation to the sampling distribution as statisticians 
would like.
Statisticians meet this challenge by reducing the degrees of freedom. To 
accomplish the reduction they use a fairly involved formula that depends on 
the sample standard deviations and the sample sizes. 
Because the variances aren’t equal, a pooled estimate is not appropriate. So 
you calculate the t-test in a different way:
You evaluate the test statistic against a member of the t-distribution family 
that has the reduced degrees of freedom. 
TTEST
The worksheet function TTEST eliminates the muss, fuss, and bother of work-
ing through the formulas for the t-test. 
Figure 11-6 shows the data for the FarKlempt machines example I showed you 
earlier. The Figure also shows the Function Arguments dialog box for TTEST. 
Follow these steps:
 
1. Type the data for each sample into a separate data array and select a 
cell for the result.
 
 For this example, the data for the Machine 1 sample are in column B and 
the data for the Machine 2 sample are in column D.
 
2. From the Statistical Functions menu, select TTEST to open the 
Function Arguments dialog box for TTEST.

198
Part III: Drawing Conclusions from Data 
 
Figure 11-6: 
Working 
with TTEST.
 
 
3. In the Function Arguments dialog box, enter the appropriate values 
for the arguments.
 
 In the Array1 box, enter the sequence of cells that holds the data for one 
of the samples. In this example, the Machine 1 data are in B3:B12.
 
 In the Array2 box, enter the sequence of cells that holds the data for the 
other sample. The Machine 2 data are in D3:D12.
 
 The Tails box indicates whether this is a one-tailed test or a two-tailed 
test. In this example, it’s a two-tailed test, so I typed 2 in this box. 
 
 The Type box holds a number that indicates the type of t-test. The 
choices are 1 for a paired test (which you find out about in an upcom-
ing section), 2 for two samples assuming equal variances, and 3 for two 
samples assuming unequal variances. I typed 2. 
 
 With values supplied for all the arguments, the dialog box shows the 
probability associated with the t value for the data. It does not show 
the value of t.
 
4. Click OK to put the answer in the selected cell.
The value in the dialog box in Figure 11-6 is less than .05, so the decision is to 
reject H0. 
By the way, for this example, typing 3 into the Type box (indicating unequal 
variances) results in a very slight adjustment in the probability from the 
equal variance test. The adjustment is small because the sample variances 
are almost equal and the sample sizes are the same.

199
 Chapter 11: Two-Sample Hypothesis Testing
Data Analysis Tools: t-test: Two Sample 
Excel provides data analysis tools that carry out t-tests. One tool works for 
the equal variance cases, another for the unequal variances case. As you’ll 
see, when you use these tools you end up with more information than TTEST 
gives you.
Here’s an example that applies the equal variances t-test tool to the data from 
the FarKlempt machines example. Figure 11-7 shows the data along with the 
dialog box for t-Test: Two-Sample Assuming Equal Variances.

To use this tool, follow these steps:
 
1. Type the data for each sample into a separate data array.
 
 For this example, the data in the Machine 1 sample are in column B and 
the data for the Machine 2 sample are in column D.
 
2. Select Data | Data Analysis to open the Data Analysis dialog box.
 
3. In the Data Analysis dialog box, scroll down the Analysis Tools list 
and select t-Test: Two Sample Assuming Equal Variances. Click OK to 
open this tool’s dialog box.
 
 This is the dialog box in Figure 11-7.
 
4. In the Variable 1 Range box, enter the cell range that holds the data 
for one of the samples.
 
 For the example, the Machine 1 data are in $B$3:$B$12. (Note the $-signs 
for absolute referencing.)
 
5. In the Variable 2 Range box, enter the cell range that holds the data 
for the other sample.
 
 The Machine 2 data are in $D$3:$D$12.

Part III: Drawing Conclusions from Data 
 
6. In the Hypothesized Mean Difference box, type the difference 
between μ1 and μ2 that H0 specifies.
 
 In this example, that difference is 0. If the cell ranges include column 
headings, check the Labels checkbox. I included the headings in the 
ranges, so I checked the box.
 
7. The Alpha box has 0.05 as a default. Change that value if you’re so 
inclined.
 
8. In the Output Options, select a radio button to indicate where you 
want the results.
 
 I selected New Worksheet Ply to put the results on a new page in the 
worksheet.
 
9. Click OK.
 
 Because I selected New Worksheet Ply, a newly created page opens with 
the results. 
Figure 11-8 shows the tool’s results, after I expanded the columns. Rows 4 
through 7 hold sample statistics. Cell B8 shows the H0-specified difference 
between the population means, and B9 shows the degrees of freedom. 
The remaining rows provide t-related information. The calculated value of the 
test statistic is in B10. Cell B11 gives the proportion of area the positive value 
of the test statistic cuts off in the upper tail of the t-distribution with the indi-
cated df. Cell B12 gives the critical value for a one-tailed test: That’s the value 
that cuts off the proportion of the area in the upper tail equal to α. 
Cell B13 doubles the proportion in B11. This cell holds the proportion of area 
from B11 added to the proportion of area that the negative value of the test 
statistic cuts off in the lower tail. Cell B14 shows the critical value for a two-
tailed test: That’s the positive value that cuts off α/2 in the upper tail. The 
corresponding negative value (not shown) cuts off α/2 in the lower tail.

 Chapter 11: Two-Sample Hypothesis Testing
The samples in the example I used have the same number of scores and 
approximately equal variances, so applying the unequal variances version 
of the t-Test tool to that data set won’t show much of a difference from the 
equal variances case.
Instead I created another example, summarized in Table 11-2. The samples in 
this example have different sizes and widely differing variances.

To show you the difference between the equal variances tool and the unequal 
variances tool, I ran both on the data and put the results side by side. 
Figure 11-9 shows the results from both tools. To run the Unequal Variances 
tool, you go through the same steps as for the Equal Variances version with 
one exception: In the Data Analysis Tools dialog box, you select t-Test: Two 
Sample Assuming Unequal Variances.

Variances Tool shows no pooled estimate of σ2, because the t-test for that

case doesn’t use one. Another difference is in the df. As I pointed out before, 
in the unequal variances case you reduce the df based on the sample vari-
ances and the sample sizes. For the equal variances case, the df in this exam-
ple is 12, for the unequal variances case, it’s 9. 
The effects of these differences show up in the remaining statistics. The 
t values, critical values, and probabilities are different.
A Matched Set: Hypothesis Testing 
for Paired Samples
In the hypothesis tests I’ve described so far, the samples are independent of 
one another. Choosing an individual for one sample has no bearing on the 
choice of an individual for the other.
Sometimes, the samples are matched. The most obvious case is when the 
same individual provides a score under each of two conditions — as in a 
before-after study. For example, suppose ten people participate in a weight-
loss program. They weigh in before they start the program and again after 
one month on the program. The important data is the set of before-after dif-
ferences. Table 11-3 shows the data:

 Chapter 11: Two-Sample Hypothesis Testing
The idea is to think of these differences as a sample of scores, and treat them 
as you would in a one-sample t-test (Chapter 10).
You carry out a test on these hypotheses:
H0: μd ≤ 0
H1: μd > 0
The d in the subscripts stands for “Difference.” Set α = .05.
The formula for this kind of t-test is:
In this formula,  is the mean of the differences. To find , you calculate the 
standard deviation of the differences and divide by the square root of the 
number of pairs:
The df is N-1. 
From Table 11-3,
With df=9 (Number of pairs – 1), the critical value for α=.05 is 2.26. (Use TINV to 
verify.) The calculated value exceeds this value, so the decision is to reject H0.
TTEST for matched samples
Earlier, I described the worksheet function TTEST and showed you how to 
use it with independent samples. This time, I use it for the matched samples 
weight-loss example. Figure 11-10 shows the Function Argument box for 
TTEST along with data from the weight-loss example.

Here are the steps to follow:
 
1. Enter the data for each sample into a separate data array and select 
a cell.
 
 For this example, the data for the Before sample are in column B and the 
data for the After sample are in column C.
 
2. From the Statistical Functions menu, select TTEST to open the 
Function Arguments dialog box for TTEST.
 
3. In the Function Arguments dialog box, enter the appropriate values 
for the arguments.
 
 In the Array1 box, type the sequence of cells that holds the data for one 
of the samples. In this example, the Before data are in B3:B12.
 
 In the Array2 box, type the sequence of cells that holds the data for the 
other sample. The After data are in C3:C12.
 
 The Tails box indicates whether this is a one-tailed test or a two-tailed 
test. In this example, it’s a one-tailed test so I type 1 in the Tails box.
 
 The Type box holds a number that indicates the type of t-test to per-
form. The choices are 1 for a paired test, 2 for two samples assuming 
equal variances, and 3 for two samples assuming unequal variances. 
I typed 1. 
 
 With values supplied for all the arguments, the dialog box shows the 
probability associated with the t value for the data. It does not show the 
value of t.
 
4.  Click OK to put the answer in the selected cell.
The value in the dialog box in Figure 11-10 is less than .05, so the decision is 
to reject H0.

 Chapter 11: Two-Sample Hypothesis Testing
If I assign the column headers in Figure 11-10 as names for the respective 
arrays, the formula in the Formula bar can be
=TTEST(Before,After,1,1)
That format might be easier to explain if you had to show the worksheet to 
someone. (If you don’t remember how to define a name for a cell range, see 
Chapter 2.)
Data analysis tool: t-test: Paired

Excel provides a data analysis tool that takes care of just about everything 
for matched samples. It’s called t-test: Paired Two Sample for Means. In this 
section, I use it on the weight-loss data.

4. In the Variable 1 Range box, enter the cell range that holds the data 
for one of the samples.
 
 For the example, the Before data are in $B$2:$B$12. (Note the $-signs for

5. In the Variable 2 Range box, enter the cell range that holds the data 
for the other sample.
 
 The After data are in $C$2:$C$12.

 In this example, that difference is 0.
 
7. If the cell ranges include column headings, check the Labels checkbox.
 
 I included the headings in the ranges, so I checked the box.

 I selected New Worksheet Ply to put the results on a new page in the

10. Click OK.
 
 Because I selected New Worksheet Ply, a newly created page opens with 
the results. 
Figure 11-12 shows the tool’s results, after I expanded the columns. Rows 4 
through 7 hold sample statistics. The only item that’s new is the number in 
cell B7, the Pearson Correlation Coefficient. This is a number between –1 and 
+1 that indicates the strength of the relationship between the data in the first 
sample and the data in the second. 
If this number is close to 1 (as in the example), high scores in one sample are 
associated with high scores in the other, and low scores in one are associ-
ated with low scores in the other. If the number is close to –1, high scores in 
the first sample are associated with low scores in the second, and low scores 
in the first are associated with high scores in the second. 
If the number is close to zero, scores in the first sample are unrelated to 
scores in the second. Because the two samples consist of scores on the same 
people, you expect a high value. (I describe this topic in much greater detail 
in Chapter 15.)
Cell B8 shows the H0-specified difference between the population means, and 
B9 shows the degrees of freedom.

 Chapter 11: Two-Sample Hypothesis Testing
The remaining rows provide t-related information. The calculated value of the 
test statistic is in B10. Cell B11 gives the proportion of area the positive value 
of the test statistic cuts off in the upper tail of the t-distribution with the indi-
cated df. Cell B12 gives the critical value for a one-tailed test: That’s the value 
that cuts off the proportion of the area in the upper tail equal to α. 
Cell B13 doubles the proportion in B11. This cell holds the proportion of area 
from B11 added to the proportion of area that the negative value of the test 
statistic cuts off in the lower tail. Cell B13 shows the critical value for a two-
tailed test: That’s the positive value that cuts off α/2 in the upper tail. The 
corresponding negative value (not shown) cuts off α/2 in the lower tail.

Testing Two Variances
The two-sample hypothesis testing I’ve described thus far pertains to means. 
It’s also possible to test hypotheses about variances.
In this section I extend the one-variance manufacturing example I used in 
Chapter 10. FarKlempt Robotics, Inc., produces a part that has to be a certain 
length with a very small variability. They’re considering two machines to 
produce this part, and they want to choose the one that results in the least 
variability. They take a sample of parts from each machine, measure them, 
find the variance for each sample, and perform a hypothesis test to see if one 
machine’s variance is significantly greater than the other’s.
The hypotheses are:
H0: σ1
2 = σ2
2
H1: σ1
2 ≠ σ2
2
As always, an α is a must. As usual, I set it to .05. 

208
Part III: Drawing Conclusions from Data 
When you test two variances, you don’t subtract one from the other. Instead, 
you divide one by the other to calculate the test statistic. Sir Ronald Fisher is 
a famous statistician who worked out the mathematics and the family of dis-
tributions for working with variances in this way. The test statistic is named 
in his honor. It’s called an F-ratio and the test is the F test. The family of distri-
butions for the test is called the F-distribution.
Without going into all the mathematics, I’ll just tell you that, once again, df 
is the parameter that distinguishes one member of the family from another. 
What’s different about this family is that two variance estimates are involved, 
so each member of the family is associated with two values of df, rather than 
one as in the t-test. Another difference between the F-distribution and the 
others you’ve seen is that the F cannot have a negative value. Figure 11-13 
shows two members of the F-distribution family.
The test statistic is:

 Chapter 11: Two-Sample Hypothesis Testing
Suppose FarKlempt Robotics produces 10 parts with Machine 1 and finds a 
sample variance of .60 square inches. They produce 15 parts with Machine 2 
and find a sample variance of .44 square inches. Can they reject H0?
Calculating the test statistic,
The df’s are 9 and 14: The variance estimate in the numerator of the F ratio is 
based on 10 cases, and the variance estimate in the denominator is based on 
15 cases.
When the df’s are 9 and 14 and it’s a two-tailed test at α = .05, the critical 
value of F is 3.21. (In a moment, I’ll show you an Excel function that finds that 
value for you.) The calculated value is less than the critical value, so the deci-
sion is to not reject H0. 
 
It makes a difference which df is in the numerator and which df is in the 
denominator. The F-distribution for df=9 and df=14 is different from the 
F-distribution for df=14 and df=9. For example, the critical value in the latter 
case is 3.98, not 3.21.
Using F in conjunction with t
One use of the F-distribution is in conjunction with the t-test for indepen-
dent samples. Before you do the t-test, you use F to help decide whether to 
assume equal variances or unequal variances in the samples.
In the equal variances t-test example I showed you earlier, the standard devi-
ations are 2.71 and 2.79. The variances are 7.34 and 7.78. The F-ratio of these 
variances is 
Each sample is based on 10 observations, so df=9 for each sample variance. 
An F-ratio of 1.06 cuts off the upper 47 percent of the F-distribution whose 
df are 9 and 9, so it’s safe to use the equal variances version of the t-test for 
these data.
In the sidebar at the end of Chapter 10, I mention that on rare occasions a 
high α is a good thing. When H0 is a desirable outcome and you’d rather not 
reject it, you stack the deck against rejecting by setting α at a high level so 
that small differences cause you to reject H0. 

210
Part III: Drawing Conclusions from Data 
This is one of those rare occasions. It’s more desirable to use the equal vari-
ances t-test, which typically provides more degrees of freedom than the 
unequal variances t-test. Setting a high value of α (.20 is a good one) for the 
F-test enables you to be confident when you assume equal variances.
FTEST
The worksheet function FTEST calculates an F-ratio on the data from two 
samples. It doesn’t return the F-ratio. Instead, it provides the two-tailed prob-
ability of the calculated F-ratio under H0. This means that the answer is the 
proportion of area to the right of the F-ratio, and to the left of the reciprocal 
of the F-ratio (1 divided by the F-ratio).
Figure 11-14 presents the data for the FarKlempt machines example I just 
summarized for you. The Figure also shows the Function Arguments dialog 
box for FTEST.

 In the Array1 box, enter the sequence of cells that holds the data for the

 In the Array2 box, enter the sequence of cells that holds the data for the 
other sample. The Machine 2 data are in D3:D17. 
 
 With values entered for all the arguments, the answer appears in the

Had I assigned names to those two arrays, the formula in the Formula bar 
could have been:

FDIST 
You use the worksheet function FDIST to decide whether or not your calcu-
lated F-ratio is in the region of rejection. You supply a value for F, a value for 
each df, and whether the test is one-tailed or two-tailed. FDIST returns the 
probability of obtaining an F-ratio at least as high as yours if H0 is true. If that 
probability is less than your α, you reject H0. 
Here, I apply FDIST to the example I just used. The F-ratio is 1.36, with 9 and 
14 df.
The steps are:
 
1. Select a cell for the answer.
 
2. From the Statistical Functions menu, select FDIST to open the Function 
Arguments dialog box for FDIST. (See Figure 11-16.)

 In the X box, type the calculated F. For this example, the calculated F 
is 1.36.
 
 In the Deg_freedom1 box, I type the degrees of freedom for the vari-
ance estimate in the numerator of the F. The degrees of freedom for the 
numerator in this example is 9 (10 scores - 1).
 
 In the Deg_freedom2 box, I type the degrees of freedom for the variance 
estimate in the denominator of the F. The degrees of freedom for the 
denominator in this example is 14 (15 scores - 1). 
 
 With values entered for all the arguments, the answer appears in the

The value in the dialog box in Figure 11-16 is greater than .05, so the decision

FINV
Excel’s FINV worksheet function finds the value in the F-distribution that cuts 
off a given proportion of the area in the upper (right-side) tail. You can use 
it to find the critical value of F. Here, I use it to find the critical value for the 
two-tailed test in the FarKlempt machines example.

2. From the Statistical Functions menu, select FINV to open the Function 
Arguments dialog box for FINV. 
 
3. In the Function Arguments dialog box, enter the appropriate values 
for the arguments.
 
 In the Probability box, I enter the proportion of area in the upper tail. In 
this example, that’s .025 because it’s a two-tailed test with α = .05. 
 
 In the Deg_freedom1 box, I type the degrees of freedom for the numera-
tor. For this example, df for the numerator = 9. 
 
 In the Deg_freedom2 box, I type the degrees of freedom for the denomi-

tatistics would be limited if you could only make inferences about one

are independent of one another, and what to do when they’re not. In both

I also introduce Excel data analysis tools that do the work for you. Although 
these tools aren’t at the level you’d find in a dedicated statistical package, 
you can combine them with Excel’s standard features to produce some 
sophisticated analyses.
Testing More Than Two
Imagine this situation. Your company asks you to evaluate three different 
methods for training its employees to do a particular job. You randomly 
assign 30 employees to one of the three methods. Your plan is to train them, 
test them, tabulate the results, and make some conclusions. Before you can 
finish the study, three people leave the company — one from the Method 1 
group, and two from the Method 3 group. 
Table 12-1 shows the data.

Do the three methods provide different results, or are they so similar that 
you can’t distinguish among them? To decide, you have to carry out a 
hypothesis test:
H0: μ1 = μ2 = μ3
H1: Not H0
with α = .05.
A thorny problem
Sounds pretty easy, particularly if you’ve read Chapter 11. Take the mean 
of the scores from Method 1, the mean of the scores from Method 2, and do 
a t-test to see if they’re different. Follow the same procedure for Method 1 
versus Method 3, and for Method 2 versus Method 3. If at least one of those 
t-tests shows a significant difference, reject H0. Nothing to it, right?
Wrong. If your α is .05 for each t-test, you’re setting yourself up for a Type I 
error with a probability higher than you planned on. The probability that at 
least one of the three t-test results in a significant difference is way above .05. 

219
 Chapter 12: Testing More Than Two Samples
In fact, it’s .14, which is way beyond acceptable. (The mathematics behind 
calculating that number is a little involved, so I won’t elaborate.)
With more than three samples, the situation gets even worse. Four groups 
require six t-tests, and the probability that at least one of them is significant 
is .26. Table 12-2 shows what happens with increasing numbers of samples.

Carrying out multiple t-tests is clearly not the answer. So what do you do?
A solution
It’s necessary to take a different approach. The idea is to think in terms of 
variances rather than means. 
I’d like you to think of variance in a slightly different way. The formula for 
estimating population variance, remember, is
Because the variance is almost a mean of squared deviations from the mean, 
statisticians also refer to it as Mean Square. In a way, that’s an unfortunate 
nickname: It leaves out “deviation from the mean,” but there you have it.

220
Part III: Drawing Conclusions from Data 
The numerator of the variance, excuse me, Mean Square, is the sum of 
squared deviations from the mean. This leads to another nickname, Sum of 
Squares. The denominator, as I say in Chapter 10, is degrees of freedom (df). 
So, the slightly different way to think of variance is
You can abbreviate this as
Now, on to solving the thorny problem. One important step is to find the 
Mean Squares hiding in the data. Another is to understand that you use these 
Mean Squares to estimate the variances of the populations that produced 
these samples. In this case, assume those variances are equal, so you’re 
really estimating one variance. The final step is to understand that you use 
these estimates to test the hypotheses I show you at the beginning of the 
chapter.
Three different Mean Squares are inside the data in Table 12-1. Start with the 
whole set of 27 scores, forgetting for the moment that they’re divided into 
three groups. Suppose you want to use those 27 scores to calculate an esti-
mate of the population variance. (A dicey idea, but humor me.) The mean of 
those 27 scores is 85. I’ll call that mean the grand mean because it’s the aver-
age of everything. 
So the Mean Square would be
The denominator has 26 (27–1) degrees of freedom. I refer to that variance 
as the Total Variance, or in the new way of thinking about this, the MSTotal. It’s 
often abbreviated as MST.
Here’s another variance to consider. In Chapter 11, I describe the t-test for 
two samples with equal variances. For that test, you put the two sample 
variances together to create a pooled estimate of the population variance. 
The data in Table 12-1 provide three sample variances for a pooled estimate: 
16.28, 14.18, 15.64. Assuming these numbers represent equal population vari-
ances, the pooled estimate is:

221
 Chapter 12: Testing More Than Two Samples
Because this pooled estimate comes from the variance within the groups, it’s 
called MSWithin, or MSW.
One more Mean Square to go — the variance of the sample means around 
the grand mean. In this example, that means the variance in these numbers: 
93.44, 85.20, and 75.25 — sort of. I said “sort of” because these are means, 
not scores. When you deal with means you have to take into account the 
number of scores that produced each mean. To do that you multiply each 
squared deviation by the number of scores in that sample.
So this variance is:
The df for this variance is 2 (the number of samples – 1).
Statisticians, not known for their crispness of usage, refer to this as the vari-
ance between sample means. (Among is the correct word when you’re talking 
about more than two items.) This variance is known as MSBetween, or MSB.
So you now have three estimates of population variance: MST, MSW, and MSB. 
What do you do with them? 
Remember that the original objective is to test a hypothesis about three 
means. According to H0, any differences you see among the three sample 
means are due strictly to chance. The implication is that the variance among 
those means is the same as the variance of any three numbers selected at 
random from the population. 
If you could somehow compare the variance among the means (that’s MSB, 
remember) with the population variance, you could see if that holds up. If 
only you had an estimate of the population variance that’s independent of 
the differences among the groups, you’d be in business.
Ah . . . but you do have that estimate. You have MSW, an estimate based on 
pooling the variances within the samples. Assuming those variances repre-
sent equal population variances, this is a pretty solid estimate. In this exam-
ple, it’s based on 24 degrees of freedom.

222
Part III: Drawing Conclusions from Data 
The reasoning now becomes: If MSB is about the same as MSW, you have evi-
dence consistent with H0. If MSB is significantly larger than MSW, you have evi-
dence that’s inconsistent with H0. In effect, you transform these hypotheses
H0: μ1 = μ2 = μ3
H1: Not H0
into these
H0: σB

Rather than multiple t-tests among sample means, you perform a test of the 
difference between two variances. 
What is that test? In Chapter 11 I show you the test for hypotheses about 
two variances. It’s called the F-test. To perform this test, you divide one vari-
ance by the other. You evaluate the result against a family of distributions 
called the F-distribution. Because two variances are involved, two values for 
degrees of freedom define each member of the family. 
For this example, F has df = 2 (for the MSB) and df = 24 (for the MSW). 
Figure 12-1 shows what this member of the F family looks like. For our 
 purposes, it’s the distribution of possible F values if H0 is true.
The test statistic for the example is:
What proportion of area does this value cut off in the upper tail of the 
F-distribution? From Figure 12-1, you can see that this proportion is micro-
scopic, as the values on the horizontal axis only go up to 5. (And the propor-
tion of area beyond 5 is tiny.) It’s way less than .05.
This means that it’s highly unlikely that differences among the means are due 
to chance. It means that you reject H0.
 
This whole procedure for testing more than two samples is called the analysis 
of variance, often abbreviated as ANOVA. In the context of an ANOVA, the 
denominator of an F-ratio has the generic name error term. The independent 
variable is sometimes called a factor. So this is a single-factor or (one-factor) 
ANOVA.

In this example, the factor is Training Method. Each instance of the indepen-
dent variable is called a level. The independent variable in this example has 
three levels.
More complex studies have more than one factor, and each factor can have 
many levels.
Meaningful relationships
Take another look at the Mean Squares in this example, each with its Sum of 
Squares and degrees of freedom. Before, when I calculated each Mean Square 
for you, I didn’t explicitly show you each Sum of Squares, but here I include 
them:

224
Part III: Drawing Conclusions from Data 
Start with the degrees of freedom: dfB = 2, dfW = 24, and dfT = 26. Is it a coinci-
dence that they add up? Hardly. It’s always the case that
How about those Sums of Squares?
Again, this is no coincidence. In the analysis of variance, this always happens:
In fact, statisticians who work with the analysis of variance speak of parti-
tioning (read “breaking down into non-overlapping pieces”) the SST into one 
portion for the SSB and another for the SSW, and partitioning the dfT into one 
amount for the dfB and another for the dfW.
After the F-test
The F-test enables you to decide whether or not to reject H0. After you decide 
to reject, then what? All you can say is that somewhere within the set of 
means, something is different from something else. The F-test doesn’t specify 
what those “somethings” are.
Planned comparisons
In order to get more specific, you have to do some further tests. Not only 
that, you have to plan those tests in advance of carrying out the ANOVA. 
What are those tests? Given what I said earlier, this might surprise you: 
t-tests. While this might sound inconsistent with the increased alpha of mul-
tiple t-tests, it’s not. If an analysis of variance enables you to reject H0, then 
it’s OK to use t-tests to turn the magnifying glass on the data and find out 
where the differences are. And as I’m about to show you, the t-test you use is 
slightly different from the one I discuss in Chapter 11.
These post-ANOVA t-tests are called planned comparisons. Some refer to 
them as a priori tests. I illustrate by following through with the example. 
Suppose before you gathered the data, you had reason to believe that 
Method 1 would result in higher scores than Method 2, and that Method 
2 would result in higher scores than Method 3. In that case, you plan in 
advance to compare the means of those samples in the event your ANOVA-
based decision is to reject H0.

225
 Chapter 12: Testing More Than Two Samples
The formula for this kind of t-test is
It’s a test of 
H0: μ1 ≤ μ2
H1: μ1 > μ2
MSW takes the place of the pooled estimate sp
2 I show you in Chapter 11. In 
fact, when I introduced MSW, I showed how it’s just a pooled estimate that 
can incorporate variances from more than two samples. The df for this t-test 
is dfW, rather than (n1 – 1) + (n2 – 1).
For this example, the Method 1 versus Method 2 comparison is:
With df = 24, this value of t cuts off a miniscule portion of area in the upper 
tail of the t-distribution. The decision is to reject H0.
The planned comparison t-test formula I showed you matches up with the 
t-test for two samples. You can write the planned comparison t-test formula 
in a way that sets up additional possibilities. Start by writing the numerator
a bit differently:
The +1 and –1 are comparison coefficients. I refer to them, in a general way, as 
c1 and c2. In fact, c3 and 
 can enter the comparison, even if you’re just com-
paring 
 with 
:
The important thing is that the coefficients add up to zero.

226
Part III: Drawing Conclusions from Data 
Here’s how the comparison coefficients figure into the planned comparison 
t-test formula for a study that involves three samples:
Applying this formula to Method 2 versus Method 3:
The value for t indicates the results from Method 2 are significantly higher 
than the results from Method 3.
You can also plan a more complex comparison — say, Method 1 versus the 
average of Method 2 and Method 3. Begin with the numerator. That would be
With comparison coefficients, you can write this as
If you’re more comfortable with whole numbers, you can write it as:
Plugging these whole numbers into the formula gives you
Again, strong evidence for rejecting H0.

227
 Chapter 12: Testing More Than Two Samples
Unplanned comparisons
Things would get boring if your post-ANOVA testing is limited to compari-
sons you have to plan in advance. Sometimes you want to snoop around 
your data and see if anything interesting reveals itself. Sometimes something 
jumps out at you that you didn’t anticipate. 
When this happens, you can make comparisons you didn’t plan on. These 
comparisons are called a posteriori tests, post hoc tests, or simply unplanned 
comparisons. Statisticians have come up with a wide variety of these tests, 
many of them with exotic names and many of them dependent on special 
sampling distributions. 
The idea behind these tests is that you pay a price for not having planned 
them in advance. That price has to do with stacking the deck against reject-
ing H0 for the particular comparison.
Of all the unplanned tests available, the one I like best is a creation of famed 
statistician Henry Scheffé. As opposed to esoteric formulas and distributions, 
you start with the test I already showed you, and then add a couple of easy-
to-do extras. 
The first extra is to understand the relationship between t and F. I’ve shown 
you the F-test for three samples. You can also carry out an F-test for two 
samples. That F-test has df = 1 and df = (n1 – 1) + (n2 – 1). The df for the t-test, 
of course, is (n1 – 1) + (n2 – 1). Hmmm . . . seems like they should be related 
somehow. 
They are. The relationship between the two-sample t and the two-sample F is
Now I can tell you the steps for performing Scheffé’s test:
 
1. Calculate the planned comparison t-test.
 
2. Square the value to create F. 
 
3. Find the critical value of F for dfB and dfW at α = .05 (or whatever α 
you choose). 
 
4. Multiply this critical F by the number of samples – 1. 
 
 The result is your critical F for the unplanned comparison. I’ll call this F’.
 
5. Compare the calculated F to F’. If the calculated F is greater, reject H0 
for this test. If it’s not, don’t reject H0 for this test.

228
Part III: Drawing Conclusions from Data 
Imagine that in the example, you didn’t plan in advance to compare the mean 
of Method 1 with the mean of Method 3. (In a study involving only three sam-
ples that’s hard to imagine, I grant you.) The t-test is:
Squaring this result gives
For F with 2 and 24 df and α = .05, the critical value is 3.403. (You can look 
that up in a table in a statistics textbook or you can use the worksheet func-
tion FINV.) So
Because the calculated F, 91.61, is greater than F’, the decision is to reject 
H0. You have evidence that Method 1’s results are different from Method 3’s 
results. 
Data analysis tool: Anova: Single Factor
The calculations for the ANOVA can get intense. Excel has a data analysis 
tool that does the heavy lifting. It’s called Anova: Single Factor. Figure 12-2 
shows this tool along with the data for the preceding example.
 
Figure 12-2:

dialog box.
 

229
 Chapter 12: Testing More Than Two Samples
The steps for using this tool are:
 
1. Enter the data for each sample into a separate data array.
 
 For this example the data in the Method 1 sample are in column B, 
the data in the Method 2 sample are in Column C, and the data for the 
Method 3 sample are in column D.
 
2. Select Data | Data Analysis to open the Data Analysis dialog box.
 
3. In the Data Analysis dialog box, scroll down the Analysis Tools list 
and select Anova: Single Factor. Click OK to open the Anova: Single 
Factor dialog box.
 
 This is the dialog box in Figure 12-2.
 
4. In the Input Range box, enter the cell range that holds all the data.
 
 For the example, the data are in $B$2:$D$12. (Note the $-signs for abso-
lute referencing.)
 
5. If the cell ranges include column headings, check the Labels checkbox.
 
 I included the headings in the ranges, so I checked the box.
 
6. The Alpha box has 0.05 as a default. Change that value if you’re so 
inclined.
 
7. In the Output Options, select a radio button to indicate where you 
want the results.
 
 I selected New Worksheet Ply to put the results on a new page in the 
worksheet.
 
8. Click OK.
 
 Because I selected New Worksheet Ply, a newly created page opens with 
the results. 
Figure 12-3 shows the tool’s output, after I expanded the columns. The output 
features two tables, SUMMARY and ANOVA. The SUMMARY table provides 
summary statistics of the samples — the number in each group, the group 
sums, averages, and variances. The ANOVA table presents the Sums of 
Squares, df, Mean Squares, F, P-value, and critical F for the indicated df. The 
P-value is the proportion of area that the F cuts off in the upper tail of the 
F-distribution. If this value is less than .05, reject H0.

Comparing the means
Excel’s ANOVA tool does not provide a built-in facility for carrying out 
planned (or unplanned) comparisons among the means. With a little ingenu-
ity, however, you can use the Excel worksheet function SUMPRODUCT to do 
those comparisons. 
The worksheet page with the ANOVA output is the launching pad for the 
planned comparisons. In this section, I take you through one planned 
 comparison — the mean of Method 1 versus the mean of Method 2.
Begin by creating columns that hold important information for the compari-
sons. Figure 12-4 shows what I mean. I put the comparison coefficients in 
column J, the squares of those coefficients in column K, and the reciprocal of 
each sample size (1/n) in column L. 
 
Figure 12-4: 
Carrying out 
a planned 
comparison.
 

231
 Chapter 12: Testing More Than Two Samples
A few rows below those cells, I put t-test related information — the t-test 
numerator, the denominator, and the value of t. I use separate cells for the 
numerator and denominator to simplify the formulas. You can put them 
together in one big formula and just have a cell for t, but it’s hard to keep 
track of everything. 
SUMPRODUCT takes arrays of cells, multiplies the numbers in the corre-
sponding cells, and sums the products. (This function is in the Math & Trig 
Functions menu, not the Statistical Functions menu.) I used SUMPRODUCT to 
multiply each coefficient by each sample mean and then add the products. 
I stored that result in K11. That’s the numerator for the planned comparison 
t-test. The formula for K11 is 
=SUMPRODUCT(J5:J7,D5:D7)
The array J5:J7 holds the comparison coefficients, and D5:D7 holds the 
sample means.
K12 holds the denominator. I selected K12 so you could see its formula in the 
formula bar:
=SQRT(D13*(SUMPRODUCT(K5:K7,L5:L7)))
D13 has the MSW. SUMPRODUCT multiplies the squared coefficients in K5:K7 
by the reciprocals of the sample sizes in L5:L7 and sums the products. SQRT 
takes the square root of the whole thing.
K13 holds the value for t. That’s just K11 divided by K12.
K14 presents the P-value for t — the proportion of area that t cuts off in the 
upper tail of the t-distribution with df = 24. The formula for that cell is
=TDIST(K13,C13,1)
The arguments are the calculated t (in K13), the degrees of freedom for MSW 
(in C13), and the number of tails. 
If you change the coefficients in J5:J7, you instantaneously create and com-
plete another comparison.
In fact, I’ll do that right now, and show you Scheffé’s post hoc comparison. 
That one, in this example, compares the mean of Method 1 with the mean 
of Method 3. Figure 12-5 shows the extra information for this test, starting a 
couple of rows below the t-test. 

232
Part III: Drawing Conclusions from Data 
 
Figure 12-5: 
Carrying out 
a post hoc 
comparison.
 
Cell K16 holds F, the square of the t value in K13. K17 has F’, the product of 
C12 (dfB, which is the number of samples – 1) and G12 (the critical value of 
F for 2 and 24 degrees of freedom and α = .05). K16 is greater than K17, so 
reject H0 for this comparison.
Another Kind of Hypothesis, 
Another Kind of Test
The ANOVA I just showed you works with independent samples. As you may 
remember from Chapter 11, sometimes you work with matched samples. For 
example, sometimes a person provides data in a number of different condi-
tions. In this section, I introduce the ANOVA you use when you have more 
than two matched samples.
This type of ANOVA is called repeated measures. You’ll see it called other 
names, too, like randomized blocks or within subjects.
Working with repeated measures ANOVA
To show how this works, I extend the example from Chapter 11. In that exam-
ple, ten people participate in a weight-loss program. Table 12-3 shows their 
data over a three-month period.

Is the program effective? This question calls for a hypothesis test:
H0: μBefore = μ1 = μ2 = μ3
H1: Not H0
Once again, I set α = .05
As in the previous ANOVA, start with the variances in the data. The MST is 
the variance in all 40 scores from the grand mean, which is 187.525:
The people participating in the weight-loss program also supply variance. 
Each one’s overall mean (his or her average over the four measurements) 
varies from the grand mean. Because these data are in the rows, I call this 
MSRows:

234
Part III: Drawing Conclusions from Data 
The means of the columns also vary from the grand mean:
One more source of variance is in the data. Think of it as the variance left 
over after you pull out the variance in the rows and the variance in the col-
umns from the total variance. Actually, it’s more correct to say that it’s the 
Sum of Squares left over when you subtract the SSRows and the SSColumns from 
the SST.
This variance is called MSError. As I say earlier, in the ANOVA the denomina-
tor of an F is called an “error term.” So the word “error” here gives you a hint 
that this MS is a denominator for an F. 
To calculate MSError, you use the relationships among the Sums of Squares 
and among the df.
Here’s another way to calculate the dfError: 
To perform the hypothesis test, you calculate the F:
With 3 and 27 degrees of freedom, the critical F for α = .05 is 2.96. (Look it up 
or use the Excel worksheet function FINV.) The calculated F is larger than the 
critical F, so the decision is to reject H0.
What about an F involving MSRows? That one doesn’t figure into H0 for this 
example. If you find a significant F, all it shows is that people are different 
from one another with respect to weight and that doesn’t tell you very much.
As is the case with the ANOVA I showed you before, you plan comparisons to 
zero in on the differences. You can use the same formula, except you substi-
tute MSError for MSW:

235
 Chapter 12: Testing More Than Two Samples
The df for this test is dfError.
For Scheffé’s post hoc test, you also follow the same procedure as before and 
substitute MSError for MSW. The only other change is to substitute dfColumns for 
dfB and substitute dfError for dfW when you find F’.
Getting trendy
In situations like the one in the weight-loss example, you have an inde-
pendent variable that’s quantitative — its levels are numbers (0 months, 
1 month, 2 months, 3 months). Not only that, but in this case, the intervals 
are equal. 
With that kind of an independent variable, it’s often a good idea to look for 
trends in the data, rather than just plan comparisons among means. If you 
graph the means in the weight-loss example, they seem to approximate a line, 
as Figure 12-6 shows. Trend analysis is the statistical procedure that exam-
ines that pattern. The objective is to see if the pattern contributes to the sig-
nificant differences among the means.

A trend can be linear, as it apparently is in this example, or nonlinear (in which 
the means fall on a curve). In this example, I only deal with linear trend.
To analyze a trend, you use comparison coefficients — those numbers you 
use in planned comparisons. You use them in a slightly different way than 
you did before. 

236
Part III: Drawing Conclusions from Data 
Here, you use comparison coefficients to find a Sum of Squares for linear 
trend. I abbreviate that as SSLinear. This is a portion of SSColumns. In fact,
Also,
After you calculate SSLinear, you divide it by dfLinear to produce MSLinear. This is 
extremely easy because dfLinear = 1. Divide MSLinear by MSError and you have an 
F. If that F is higher than the critical value of F with df = 1 and dfError at your α 
–level, then weight is decreasing in a linear way over the time period of the 
weight-loss program.
The comparison coefficients are different for different numbers of samples. 
For four samples, the coefficients are –3, –1, 1, and 3. To form the SSLinear the 
formula is 
In this formula, n is the number of people and c represents the coefficients. 
Applying the formula to this example, 
This is such a large proportion of SSColumns that SSNonlinear is really small:
As I pointed out before, df = 1, so MSLinear is conveniently the same as SSLinear. 
Finally, 
The critical value for F with 1 and 27 degrees of freedom and α = .05 is 4.21. 
Because the calculated value is larger than the critical value, statisticians 
would say the data shows a significant linear component. This, of course, veri-
fies what you see in Figure 12-6.

237
 Chapter 12: Testing More Than Two Samples
A little more on trend
The coefficients I showed you represent 
one possible component of what underlies 
the  differences among the four means in the 
 example — the linear component. With four 
means, it’s also possible to have other com-
ponents. I lumped those other components 
together into a category I called nonlinear. Now 
I discuss them explicitly. 
One possibility is that four means can differ 
from one another and form a trend that looks 
like a curve, as in the next figure.

Part III: Drawing Conclusions from Data 
Data analysis tool: Anova: Two Factor 
Without Replication
Huh? Is that a misprint? Two-Factor??? Without Replication?? What’s that all 
about? 
Here’s the story: If you’re looking through the data analysis tools for some-
thing like Anova: Single Factor Repeated Measures, you won’t find it. The tool 
you’re looking for is there, but it’s hiding out under a different name.
Figure 12-7 shows this tool’s dialog box along with the data for the preceding 
weight-loss example.
(continued)
The first kind, where the trend changes direc-
tion once is called a quadratic component. In the 
first figure it increases, and then it decreases. 
The second, where the trend changes direc-
tion twice is called a cubic component. In the 
second figure it increases, decreases, and 
then increases again. In Figure 12-6, the trend 
is linear and doesn’t change direction (it just 
keeps decreasing). 
Quadratic and cubic components have coeffi-
cients, too, and here they are:
Quadratic: 1, –1, –1, 1
Cubic: –1, 3, –3, 1
You test for these components the same way 
you test for the linear component. A trend can 
be a combination of components: If you have a 
significant F, one or more of these trend compo-
nents might be significant.
Linear, quadratic, and cubic are as far as you 
can go with four means. With five means, you 
can look for those three plus a quartic compo-
nent (three direction-changes), and with six you 
can try and scope out all of the preceding plus 
a quintic component (four direction-changes). 
What do the coefficients look like?
For five means, they’re:
Linear: –2, –1, 0 , 1, 2
Quadratic: 2, –1, –2, –1, 2
Cubic: -1, 2, 0, –2, 1
Quartic: 1, –4, 6, –4, 1
And for six means:
Linear: –5, –3, –1 , 1, 3, 5
Quadratic: 5, –1, –4, –4, –1, 5
Cubic: –5, 7, 4, –4, –7, 5
Quartic: 1, –3, 2, 2, –3, 1
Quintic: –1, 5, –10, 10, –5, 1
I could go on with more means, coefficents, 
and exotic component names (hextic? septic?), 
but enough already. This should hold you for a 
while.

and select Anova: Two Factor Without Replication. Click OK to open 
the select Anova: Two Factor Without Replication dialog box.
 
 This is the dialog box in Figure 12-7.

is part of the data.
 
5. If the cell ranges include column headings, select the Labels option.
 
 I included the headings in the ranges, so I checked the box.

Part III: Drawing Conclusions from Data 
Figure 12-8 shows the tool’s output, after I expanded the columns. The output 
features two tables, SUMMARY and ANOVA. 
The SUMMARY table is in two parts. The first part provides summary sta-
tistics for the rows. The second part provides summary statistics for the 
columns. Summary statistics include the number of scores in each row and in 
each column along with the sums, means, and variances. 
The ANOVA table presents the Sums of Squares, df, Mean Squares, F, 
P-values, and critical F-ratios for the indicated df. The table features 
two values for F. One F is for the rows, the other for the columns. The 
P-value is the proportion of area that the F cuts off in the upper tail of the 
F-distribution. If this value is less than .05, reject H0. 
Although the ANOVA table includes an F for the rows, this doesn’t concern 
you in this case, as H0 is only about the columns in the data. Each row repre-
sents the data for one person. A high F just implies that people are different 
from one another, and that’s not news.

Excel’s Anova: Two Factor Without Replication tool does not provide a way 
for performing a trend analysis. As with the planned comparisons, a little 
ingenuity takes you a long way. The Excel worksheet functions SUMPRODUCT 
and SUMSQ help with the calculations. 

241
 Chapter 12: Testing More Than Two Samples
The worksheet page with the ANOVA output gives the information you need 
to get started. In this section, I take you through the analysis of linear trend.
I start by putting the comparison coefficients for linear trend into J15 through 
J18, as shown in Figure 12-9. 
 
Figure 12-9: 
Carrying 
out a trend 
analysis.
 
In J22 through J24, I put information related to SSLinear — the numerator, the 
denominator, and the value of the Sum of Squares. I use separate cells for the 
numerator and denominator to simplify the formulas. 
As I pointed out before, SUMPRODUCT takes arrays of cells, multiplies the 
numbers in the corresponding cells, and sums the products. (This func-
tion is on the Math & Trig menu, not the Statistical Functions menu.) I used 
SUMPRODUCT to multiply each coefficient by each sample mean and then 
add the products. I stored that result in J22. That’s the numerator for the 
SSLinear. I selected J22 so you could see its formula in the Formula bar: 
=B15*SUMPRODUCT(J15:J18,D15:D18)^2
The value in B15 is the number in each column. The array J15:J18 holds the 
comparison coefficients, and D15:D18 holds the column means.
J23 holds the denominator. Its formula is:
=SUMSQ(J15:J18)

242
Part III: Drawing Conclusions from Data 
SUMSQ (another function on the Math & Trig Functions menu) squares the 
coefficients in J15:J18 and adds them.
J24 holds the value for SSLinear. That’s J22 divided by J23.
Figure 12-9 shows that in the ANOVA table I’ve inserted two rows above 
the row for Error. One row holds the SS, df, MS, F, P-Value and critical F for 
Linear, the other holds these values for Nonlinear. SSNonlinear in B26 is B24-B25. 
The F for Linear is D25 divided by D27. The formula for the P-Value in F25 is
=FDIST(E25,C25,C27)
The first argument, E25, is the F. The second and third arguments are the df. 
The formula for the critical F in F25 is
=FINV(0.05,C25,C27)
The first argument is α, and the second and third are the df.

n Chapter 11, I show you how to test hypotheses with two samples. In 
Chapter 12, I show you how to test hypotheses when you have more than 
two samples. The common thread through both chapters is that one indepen-
dent variable (also called a factor) is involved.
Many times, you have to test the effects of more than one factor. In this 
Chapter, I show how to analyze two factors within the same set of data. 
Several types of situations are possible, and I describe Excel data analysis 
tools that deal with each one.
Cracking the Combinations
FarKlempt Robotics, Inc., manufactures battery-powered robots. They want 
to test three rechargeable batteries for these robots on a set of three tasks — 
climbing, walking, and assembling. Which combination of battery and task 
results in the longest battery life?
They test a sample of nine robots. They randomly assign each robot one bat-
tery and one type of task. FarKlempt tracks the number of days each robot 
works before recharging. The data are in Table 13-1.

This calls for two hypothesis tests:
H0: μBattery1 = μBattery2 = μBattery3
H1: Not H0
and
H0: μClimbing = μWalking = μAssembling
H1: Not H0
In both tests, set α = .05.
Breaking down the variances
The appropriate analysis for these tests is an analysis of variance (ANOVA). 
Each variable — Batteries and Tasks — is also called a factor. So this analysis 
is called a two-factor ANOVA.
To understand this ANOVA, consider the variances inside the data. First, 
focus on the variance in the whole set of nine numbers — MST. (“T” in the 
subscript stands for “Total.”) The mean of those numbers is 15.44. Because 
it’s the mean of all the numbers, it goes by the name grand mean. 
This variance is

245
 Chapter 13: Slightly More Complicated Testing
The means of the three batteries (the column means) also vary from 15.44. 
That variance is 
Why does the 3 appear as a multiplier of each squared deviation? When you 
deal with means, you have to take into account the number of scores that 
produced each mean. 
Similarly, the means of the tasks (the row means) vary from 15.44:
One variance is left. It’s called MSError. This is what remains when you sub-
tract the SSBatteries and the SSTasks from the SST, and divide that by the df that 
remains when you subtract dfBatteries and dfTasks from dfT:
To test the hypotheses, you calculate one F for the effects of the batteries and 
another for the effects of the tasks. For both, the denominator (the so-called 
“error term”) is MSError:
Each F has 2 and 4 degrees of freedom. With α = .05, the critical F in each 
case is 6.94. The decision is to reject H0 for the batteries (they differ from one 
another to an extent greater than chance), but not for the tasks.
To zero in on the differences for the batteries, you carry out planned com-
parisons among the column means. (See Chapter 12 for the details.)

Data analysis tool: Anova: Two-Factor 
Without Replication
Excel’s Anova: Two-Factor Without Replication tool carries out the analysis 
I just outlined. (I used this tool for another type of analysis in Chapter 12.) 
Without Replication means that only one robot is assigned to each battery-
task combination. If you assign more than one to each combination, that’s 
replication.
Figure 13-1 shows this tool’s dialog box along with the data for the batteries-
tasks example.

The steps for using this tool are:
 
1. Enter the data into the worksheet, and include labels for the rows and 
columns. 
 
 For this example, the labels for the tasks are in cells B4, B5, and B6. The 
labels for the batteries are in cells C3, D3, and E3. The data are in cells 
C4 through E6.
 
2. Select Data | Data Analysis to open the Data Analysis dialog box.
 
3. In the Data Analysis dialog box, scroll down the Analysis Tools list 
and select Anova: Two Factor Without Replication. Click OK to open 
the select Anova: Two Factor Without Replication dialog box.
 
 This is the dialog box in Figure 13-1.
 
4. In the Input Range box, enter the cell range that holds all the data.
 
 For the example, the data range is $B$3:$E$6. Note the $-signs for abso-
lute referencing. Note also — and this is important — the row labels are 

247

part of the data range. The column labels are, too. The first cell in the 
data range, B2, is blank, but that’s OK.
 
5. If the cell ranges include column headings, select the Labels option.
 
 I included the headings in the ranges, so I checked the box.
 
6. The Alpha box has 0.05 as a default. Change that value if you want a 
different α.
 
7. In the Output Options, select a radio button to indicate where you

 I selected New Worksheet Ply to put the results on a new page in the 
worksheet.
 
8. Click OK.
 
 Because I selected New Worksheet Ply, a newly created page opens with 
the results. 
Figure 13-2 shows the tool’s output, after I expanded the columns. The output 
features two tables, SUMMARY and ANOVA. 
The SUMMARY table is in two parts. The first part provides summary statistics 
for the rows. The second part provides summary statistics for the columns. 
Summary statistics include the number of scores in each row and in each 
column along with the sums, means, and variances. 
The ANOVA table presents the Sums of Squares, df, Mean Squares, F, P-values, 
and critical F for the indicated df. The table features two values for F. One F is 
for the rows, the other for the columns. The P-value is the proportion of area 
that the F cuts off in the upper tail of the F-distribution. If this value is less than 
.05, reject H0. 
In this example, the decisions are to reject H0 for the batteries (the columns) 
and to not reject H0 for the tasks (the rows).

Part III: Drawing Conclusions from Data 
Cracking the Combinations Again
The analysis I just showed you involves one score for each combination of 
the two factors. Assigning one individual to each combination is appropriate 
for robots and other manufactured objects, where you can assume that one 
object is pretty much the same as another.
When people are involved, it’s a different story. Individual variation among 
humans is something you can’t overlook. For this reason, it’s necessary to 
assign a sample of people to a combination of factors — not just one person.
Rows and columns
I illustrate with an example. Imagine that a company has two methods of 
presenting its training information. One is via a person who presents the 
information orally, the other is via a text. Imagine also that the information is 
presented in either a humorous way or in a technical way. I refer to the first 
factor as Presentation Method and to the second as Presentation Style.
Combining the two levels of Presentation Method with the two levels of 
Presentation Style gives four combinations. The company randomly assigns 
4 people to each combination, for a total of 16 people. After providing the 
training, they test the 16 people on their comprehension of the material. 
Figure 13-3 shows the combinations, the four comprehension scores within 
each combination, and summary statistics for the combinations, rows, and 
columns.

Here are the hypotheses:
H0: μSpoken = μText
H1: Not H0
and
H0: μHumorous = μTechnical
H1: Not H0
Because the two presentation methods (Spoken and Text) are in the rows, 
I refer to Presentation Type as the row factor. The two presentation styles 
(Humorous and Technical) are in the columns, so Presentation Style is the 
column factor.
Interactions
When you have rows and columns of data, and you’re testing hypotheses 
about the row factor and the column factor, you have an additional consid-
eration. Namely, you have to be concerned about the row-column combina-
tions. Do the combinations result in peculiar effects?
For the example I presented, it’s possible that combining Spoken and Text 
with Humorous and Technical yields something unexpected. In fact, you can 
see that in the data in Figure 13-3: For Spoken presentation, the Humorous 
style produces a higher average than the Technical style. For Text presenta-
tion, the Humorous style produces a lower average than the Technical style.
 
A situation like that is called an interaction. In formal terms, an interaction 
occurs when the levels of one factor affect the levels of the other factor dif-
ferently. The label for the interaction is row factor × column factor, so for this 
example that’s Method × Type.
The hypotheses for this are:
H0: Presentation Method does not interact with Presentation Style
H1: Not H0

250
Part III: Drawing Conclusions from Data 
The analysis
The statistical analysis, once again, is an analysis of variance (ANOVA). As is 
the case with the other ANOVAs I showed you, it depends on the variances in 
the data. 
The first variance is the total variance, labeled MST. That’s the variance of all 
16 scores around their mean (the “grand mean”), which is 44.81:
The denominator tells you that df = 15 for MST.
The next variance comes from the row factor. That’s MSMethod, and it’s the 
variance of the row means around the grand mean:
The 8 multiplies each squared deviation because you have to take into 
account the number of scores that produced each row mean. The df for 
MSMethod is the number of rows – 1, which is 1.
Similarly, the variance for the column factor is
The df for MSStyle is 1 (the number of columns – 1).
Another variance is the pooled estimate based on the variances within the 
four row-column combinations. It’s called the MSWithin, or MSW. (For details on 
MSw and pooled estimates, see Chapter 12.). For this example,
This one is the error term (the denominator) for each F that you calculate. Its 
denominator tells you that df = 12 for this MS.

251
 Chapter 13: Slightly More Complicated Testing
The last variance comes from the interaction between the row factor and the 
column factor. In this example, it’s labeled MSMethod X Type. You can calculate 
this a couple of ways. The easiest way is to take advantage of this general 
relationship:
And this one:
Another way to calculate this is 
The MS is
For this example,
To test the hypotheses, you calculate three Fs: 
For df = 1 and 12, the critical F at α = .05 is 4.75. (You can use the Excel 
function FINV to verify.). The decision is to reject H0 for the Presentation 
Method and for the Method × Style interaction, and to not reject H0 for the 
Presentation Style.

Data analysis tool: Anova: Two-Factor

Excel provides a data analysis tool that handles everything. This one is called 
Anova: Two-Factor With Replication. “Replication” means you have more 
than one score in each row-column combination.

tasks example.

 For this example, the labels for the presentation methods are in cells B3 
and B7. The presentation types are in cells C2 and D2. The data are in 
cells C3 through D10.
 
2. Select Data | Data Analysis to open the Data Analysis dialog box.
 
3. In the Data Analysis dialog box, scroll down the Analysis Tools list

 This is the dialog box in Figure 13-4.

4. In the Input Range box, type the cell range that holds all the data.
 
 For the example, the data are in $B$2:$D$10. Note the $-signs for abso-
lute referencing. Note also — again, this is important — the labels for 
the row factor (presentation method) are part of the data range. The 
labels for the column factor are part of the range, too. The first cell in 
the range, B2, is blank, but that’s OK.
 
5. If the cell ranges include column headings, select the Labels option.
 
 I included the headings in the ranges, so I checked the box.
 
6. The Alpha box has 0.05 as a default. Change that value if you want a 
different α.
 
7. In the Output Options, select a radio button to indicate where you 
want the results.
 
 I selected New Worksheet Ply to put the results on a new page in the 
worksheet.
 
8. Click OK.
 
 Because I selected New Worksheet Ply, a newly created page opens with 
the results. 
Figure 13-5 shows the tool’s output, after I expanded the columns. The output 
features two tables, SUMMARY and ANOVA. 
The SUMMARY table is in two parts. The first part provides summary statis-
tics for the factor combinations and for the row factor. The second part pro-
vides summary statistics for the column factor. Summary statistics include 
the number of scores in each row-column combination, in each row, and in 
each column along with the counts, sums, means, and variances. 
The ANOVA table presents the Sums of Squares, df, Mean Squares, F, 
P-values, and critical F for the indicated df. The table features three values 
for F. One F is for the row factor, one for the column factor, and one for the 
interaction. In the table, the row factor is called Sample. The P-value is the 
proportion of area that the F cuts off in the upper tail of the F-distribution. 
If this value is less than .05, reject H0. 
In this example, the decisions are to reject H0 for the Presentation Method 
(the row factor, labeled Sample in the table), to not reject H0 for the 
Presentation Style (the column factor), and to reject H0 for the interaction.

Regression: Linear and Multiple
In This Chapter
▶ Summarizing a relationship
▶ Working with regression
▶ Hypothesis testing and regression
▶ Balancing many relationships
O
ne of the main things you do when you work with statistics is make 
predictions. The idea is to take data on one or more variables, and 
use these data to predict a value of another variable. To do this, you have 
to understand how to summarize relationships among variables, and to test 
hypotheses about those relationships. 
In this chapter, I introduce regression, a statistical way to do just that. 
Regression also enables you to use the details of relationships to make pre-
dictions. First, I show you how to analyze the relationship between one vari-
able and another. Then I show you how to analyze the relationship between a 
variable and two others. These analyses involve a good bit of calculation, and 
Excel is more than equal to the task.
The Plot of Scatter
Sahutsket University is an exciting, dynamic institution. Every year, the 
school receives thousands of applications. One challenge the Admissions 
Office faces is this: Applicants want the Office to predict what their GPAs 
(grade-point averages on a 4.0 scale) will be if they attend Sahutsket. 
What’s the best prediction? Without knowing anything about an applicant, 
and only knowing its own students’ GPAs, the answer is clear: It’s the aver-
age GPA at Sahutsket U. Regardless of who the applicant is, that’s all the 
Admissions Office can say if its knowledge is limited.

256
Part III: Drawing Conclusions from Data 
With more knowledge about the students and about the applicants, a more 
accurate prediction becomes possible. For example, if Sahutsket keeps 
records on its students’ SAT scores (Verbal and Math combined), the 
Admissions Office can match up each student’s GPA with his or her SAT 
score and see if the two pieces of data are somehow related. If they are, 
an applicant can supply his or her SAT score, and the Admissions Office 
can use that score to help make a prediction.
Figure 14-1 shows the GPA-SAT matchup in a graphic way. Because the points 
are scattered, it’s called a scatterplot. By convention, the vertical axis (the 
y-axis) represents what you’re trying to predict. That’s also called the depen-
dent variable or the y-variable. In this case, that’s GPA. Also by convention, 
the horizontal axis (the x-axis) represents what you’re using to make your 
prediction. That’s also called the independent variable or the x-variable. Here, 
that’s SAT.

Each point in the graph represents an individual student’s GPA and SAT. In 
a real scatterplot of a university student body, you’d see many more points 
than I show here. The general tendency of the set of points seems to be that 
high SAT scores are associated with high GPAs and low SAT scores are asso-
ciated with low GPAs.
I singled out one of the points. It shows a Sahutsket student with an SAT 
score of 1000 and a GPA of 2.5. I also show the average GPA to give you a 
sense that knowing the GPA-SAT relationship provides an advantage over 
just knowing the mean. 

257
 Chapter 14: Regression: Linear and Multiple
How do you make that advantage work for you? You start by summarizing 
the relationship between SAT and GPA. The summary is a line through the 
points. How and where do you draw the line? 
I’ll get to that in a minute. First, I have to tell you about lines in general.
Graphing Lines
In the world of mathematics, a line is a way to picture a relationship between 
an independent variable (x) and a dependent variable (y). In this relationship
every time I supply a value for x, I can figure out the corresponding value for y. 
The equation says to take the x-value, multiply by 2, and then add 3. 
If x = 1, for example, y = 6. If x =2, y = 8. Table 14-1 shows a number of x-y pairs 
in this relationship, including the pair in which x = 0.

Figure 14-2 shows these pairs as points on a set of x-y axes, along with a line 
through the points. Each time I list an x-y pair in parentheses, the x-value is 
first.
As the Figure shows, the points fall neatly onto the line. The line graphs the 
equation y = 4 + 2x. In fact, whenever you have an equation like this, where x 
isn’t squared or cubed or raised to any power higher than 1, you have what 
mathematicians call a linear equation. (If x is raised to a higher power than 
one, you connect the points with a curve, not a line.)

A couple of things to keep in mind about a line: You can describe a line in 
terms of how slanted it is, and where it runs into the y-axis. 
The how-slanted-it-is part is called the slope. The slope tells you how much y 
changes when x changes by 1 unit. In the line in Figure 14-2, when x changes 
by 1 (from 4 to 5, for example) y changes by 2 (from 12 to 14). 
The where-it-runs-into-the-y-axis part is called the y-intercept (or sometimes 
just the intercept). That’s the value of y when x = 0. In Figure 14-2 the y-inter-
cept is 4. 
You can see these numbers in the equation. The slope is the number that 
multiplies x and the intercept is the number you add to x. In general,
where a represents the intercept and b represents the slope.
The slope can be a positive number, a negative number, or zero. In Figure 14-2, 
the slope is positive. If the slope is negative, the line is slanted in a direc-
tion opposite to what you see in Figure 14-2. A negative slope means that 
y decreases as x increases. If the slope is zero, the line is parallel to the hori-
zontal axis. If the slope is zero, y doesn’t change as x changes.
The same applies to the intercept — it can be a positive number, a negative 
number, or zero. If the intercept is positive, the line cuts off the y-axis above 
the x-axis. If the intercept is negative, the line cuts off the y-axis below the 

259
 Chapter 14: Regression: Linear and Multiple
x-axis. If the intercept is zero, it intersects with the y-axis and the x-axis, at 
the point called the origin.
And now, back to what I was originally talking about.
Regression: What a Line!
Before I began telling you about lines, equations, slopes, and intercepts, I 
mentioned that a line is the best way to summarize the relationship in the 
scatterplot in Figure 14-1. It’s possible to draw an infinite amount of straight 
lines through the scatterplot. Which one best summarizes the relationship?
Intuitively, the “best fitting” line ought to be the one that goes through the 
maximum number of points and isn’t too far away from the points it doesn’t 
go through. For statisticians, that line has a special property: If you draw that 
line through the scatterplot, then draw distances (in the vertical direction) 
between the points and the line, and then square those distances and add 
them up, the sum of the squared distances is a minimum. 
Statisticians call this line the regression line, and indicate it as
Each y’ is a point on the line. It represents the best prediction of y for a given 
value of x.
To figure out exactly where this line is, you calculate its slope and its intercept. 
For a regression line, the slope and intercept are called regression coefficients. 
The formulas for the regression coefficients are pretty straightforward. For 
the slope, the formula is
The intercept formula is
I illustrate with an example. To keep the numbers manageable and compre-
hensible, I use a small sample instead of the thousands of students you’d 
find in a scatterplot of an entire university student body. Table 14-2 shows a 
sample of data from 20 Sahusket University students.

Using regression for forecasting
Based on this sample and this regression line, you can take an applicant’s 
SAT score, say 1230, and predict the applicant’s GPA:
Without this rule, the only prediction is the mean GPA, 2.705.
Variation around the regression line
In Chapter 5, I describe how the mean doesn’t tell the whole story about a 
set of data. You have to show how the scores vary around the mean. For that 
reason, I introduce the variance and standard deviation. 
You have a similar situation here. To get the full picture of the relationship in 
a scatterplot, you have to show how the scores vary around the regression 
line. Here, I introduce the residual variance and standard error of estimate, 
which are analogous to the variance and the standard deviation.
The residual variance is sort of an average of the squared deviations of the 
observed y-values around the predicted y-values. Each deviation of a data 
point from a predicted point (y - y’) is called a residual, hence the name. The 
formula is
I said “sort of” because the denominator is N-2, rather than N. The reason for 
the -2 is beyond our scope. As I’ve said before, the denominator of a variance 
estimate is degrees of freedom (df), and that concept comes in handy in a 
little while.

262

The standard error of estimate is 
To show you how the residual error and the standard error of estimate play 
out for the data in the example, here’s Table 14-3. This table extends Table 14-2

 Chapter 14: Regression: Linear and Multiple
As the table shows, sometimes the predicted GPA is pretty close, sometimes 
it’s not. One predicted value (4.16) is impossible.
For these data, the residual variance is
The standard error of estimate is
If the residual variance and the standard error of estimate are small, the 
regression line is a good fit to the data in the scatterplot. If the residual vari-
ance and the standard error of estimate are large, the regression line is a 
poor fit.
What’s “small”? What’s “large”? What’s a “good” fit? 
Keep reading.
Testing hypotheses about regression
The regression equation I’ve been working with
summarizes a relationship in a scatterplot of a sample. The regression coef-
ficients a and b are sample statistics. You can use these statistics to test 
hypotheses about population parameters, and that’s what I do in this section.
The regression line through the population that produces the sample (like 
the entire Sahutsket University student body, past and present) is the graph 
of an equation that consists of parameters, rather than statistics. By conven-
tion, remember, Greek letters stand for parameters, so the regression equa-
tion for the population is
The first two Greek letters on the right are α (alpha) and β (beta), the equiva-
lents of a and b. What about that last one? It looks something like the Greek 
equivalent of e. What’s it doing there?

264
Part III: Drawing Conclusions from Data 
That last term is the Greek letter epsilon. It represents “error” in the popula-
tion. In a way, “error” is an unfortunate term. It’s a catchall for “things you 
don’t know or things you have no control over.” Error is reflected in the 
residuals — the deviations from the predictions. The more you understand 
about what you’re measuring, the more you decrease the error. 
You can’t measure the error in the relationship between SAT and GPA, but 
it’s lurking there. Someone might score low on the SAT, for example, and 
then go on to have a wonderful college career with a higher-than-predicted 
GPA. On a scatterplot, this person’s SAT-GPA point looks like an error in pre-
diction. As you find out more about that person, you might discover that he 
or she was sick on the day of the SAT, and that explains the “error.” 
You can test hypotheses about α, β, and ε, and that’s what I do in the upcom-
ing subsections.
Testing the fit
I begin with a test of how well the regression line fits the scatterplot. This is a 
test of ε, the error in the relationship. 
The objective is to decide whether or not the line really does represent a 
relationship between the variables. It’s possible that what looks like a rela-
tionship is just due to chance and the equation of the regression line doesn’t 
mean anything (because the amount of error is overwhelming) — or it’s pos-
sible that the variables are strongly related. 
These possibilities are testable, and you set up hypotheses to test them:
H0: No real relationship
H1: Not H0
Although those hypotheses make nice light reading, they don’t set up a sta-
tistical test. To set up the test, you have to consider the variances. To con-
sider the variances, you start with the deviations. Figure 14-3 focuses on one 
point in a scatterplot and its deviation from the regression line (the residual) 
and from the mean of the y-variable. It also shows the deviation between the 
regression line and the mean.
As the figure shows, the distance between the point and the regression line 
and the distance between the regression line and the mean add up to the dis-
tance between the point and the mean:
This sets the stage for some other important relationships.

If you add up each of the squared deviations, you have
I just showed you this one. That’s the numerator for the residual variance. 
It represents the variability around the regression line— the “error” I spoke 
of earlier. In the terminology of Chapter 12, the numerator of a variance is 
called a Sum of Squares, or SS. So this is SSResidual.
This one is new. The deviation 
 represents the gain in prediction due 
to using the regression line rather than the mean. The sum reflects this gain, 
and is called SSRegression.
I showed you this one in Chapter 5 — although I used x rather than y. That’s 
the numerator of the variance of y. In Chapter 12 terms, it’s the numerator of 
total variance. This one is SSTotal.
This relationship holds among these three sums:

266
Part III: Drawing Conclusions from Data 
Each one is associated with a value for degrees of freedom — the denomi-
nator of a variance estimate. As I pointed out in the previous section, the 
denominator for SSResidual is N-2. The df for SSTotal is N-1 (see Chapter 5 and 
Chapter 12). As with the SS, the degrees of freedom add up:
This leaves one degree of freedom for Regression.
Where is this all headed, and what does it have to do with hypothesis test-
ing? Well, since you asked, you get variance estimates by dividing SS by 
df. Each variance estimate is called a Mean Square, abbreviated MS (again, 
Chapter 12):
Now for the hypothesis part. If H0 is true and what looks like a relationship 
between x and y is really no big deal, the piece that represents the gain in 
prediction because of the regression line (MSRegression) should be no greater 
than the variability around the regression line (MSResidual). If H0 is not true, 
and the gain in prediction is substantial, then MSRegression should be a lot 
bigger than MSResidual. 
So the hypotheses now set up as
H0: σ2
Regression ≤ σ2
Residual
H1: σ2
Regression > σ2
Residual
These are hypotheses you can test. How? To test a hypothesis about two 
variances, you use an F test (Chapter 11). The test statistic here is
To show you how it all works, I apply the formulas to the Sahusket example. 
The MSResidual is the same as syx
2 from the preceding section, and that value is 
0.16. The MSRegression is

267
 Chapter 14: Regression: Linear and Multiple
This sets up the F:
With 1 and 18 df and α = .05, the critical value of F is 4.41. (You can use the 
worksheet function FINV to verify.) The calculated F is greater than the criti-
cal F, so the decision is to reject H0. That means the regression line provides 
a good fit to the data in the sample. 
Testing the slope
Another question that arises in linear regression is whether or not the slope 
of the regression line is significantly different from zero. If it’s not, the mean 
is just as good a predictor as the regression line.
The hypotheses for this test are:
H0: β ≤ 0
H1: β > 0
The statistical test is t, which I discuss in Chapters 9, 10, and 11 in connection 
with means. The t-test for the slope is
with df = N-2. The denominator estimates the standard error of the slope. 
This term sounds more complicated than it is. The formula is:
where sx is the standard deviation of the x-variable. For the data in the example
The actual value is 6.00. Rounding syx and sb to a manageable number of deci-
mal places before calculating results in 5.96. Either way, this is larger than 
the critical value of t for 18 df and α = .05 (2.10), so the decision is to reject 
H0. This example, by the way, shows why it’s important to test hypotheses. 

268
Part III: Drawing Conclusions from Data 
The slope, 0.0034 looks like a very small number. (Possibly because it is a 
very small number.) Still, it’s big enough to reject H0 in this case.
Testing the intercept
 
For completeness, I include the hypothesis test for the intercept. I doubt you’ll 
have much use for it, but it appears in the output of some of Excel’s regression-
related capabilities. I want you to understand all aspects of that output (which 
I tell you about in a little while), so here it is.
The hypotheses are
H0: α = 0
H1: α ≠ 0
The test, once again, is a t-test. The formula is
The denominator is the estimate of the standard error of the intercept. 
Without going into detail, the formula for sa is
where sx is the standard deviation of the x-variable, sx
2 is the variance of the 
x-variable, and 
 is the squared mean of the x-variable. Applying this formula 
to the data in the example,
The t-test is 
With 18 degrees of freedom, and the probability of a Type I error at .05, the 
critical t is 2.45 for a two-tailed test. It’s a two-tailed test because H1 is that 

269
 Chapter 14: Regression: Linear and Multiple
the intercept doesn’t equal zero — it doesn’t specify whether the intercept is 
greater than zero or less than zero. Because the calculated value isn’t more 
negative than the negative critical value, the decision is to not reject H0. 
Worksheet Functions for Regression
Excel is a big help for computation-intensive work like linear regression. An 
assortment of functions and data analysis tools makes life a lot easier. In this 
section, I concentrate on the worksheet functions and on two array functions. 
Figure 14-4 shows the data I use to illustrate each function. The data are GPA 
and SAT scores for 20 students in the example I showed you earlier. As the 
figure shows, the SAT scores are in C3:C22 and the GPAs are in D3:D22. The 
SAT is the x-variable and GPA is the y-variable. 
To clarify what the functions do, I defined names for the data arrays. I defined 
SAT as the name for C3:C22 and I defined GPA as the name for D3:D22. That 
way, I can use those names in the arguments for the functions. If you don’t 
remember how to define a name for an array, go back to Chapter 2.

SLOPE, INTERCEPT, STEYX
These three functions work the same way, so I give a general description and 
provide details as necessary for each function.

1. With the data entered, select a cell.
 
2. From the Statistical Functions menu, select a regression function to 
open its Function Arguments dialog box.
 
• To calculate the slope of a regression line through the data, select 
SLOPE. 
 
• To calculate the intercept, select INTERCEPT. 
 
• To calculate the standard error of estimate, select STEYX. 
 
 Figures 14-5, 14-6, and 14-7 show the Function Arguments dialog boxes 
for these three functions.
 
3. In the Function Arguments dialog box, enter the appropriate values 
for the arguments. 
 
 In the Known_y’s box, I entered the name for the cell range that holds 
the scores for the y-variable. For this example, that’s GPA (defined as 
the name for C3:C22). 
 
 In the Known_x’s box, I entered the name for the cell range that holds 
the scores for the x-variable. For this example, it’s SAT (defined as the 
name for D3:D22). After I enter this name, the answer appears in the 
dialog box. 
 
• SLOPE’s answer is .00342556 (Figure 14-5). 
 
• INTERCEPT’s answer is –1.153832541 (Figure 14-6).

FORECAST
This one is a bit different from the preceding three. In addition to the col-
umns for the x-and-y variables, for FORECAST, you supply a value for x 
and the answer is a prediction based on the linear regression relationship 
between the x-variable and the y-variable. 
Figure 14-8 shows the Function Arguments dialog box for FORECAST. In the 
X box, I entered 1290. For this SAT, the figure shows the predicted GPA is

Array function: TREND
TREND is a versatile function. You can use TREND to generate a set of pre-
dicted y-values for the x-values in the sample. 
You can also supply a new set of x-values and generate a set of predicted 
y-values, based on the linear relationship in your sample. It’s like applying 
FORECAST repeatedly in one fell swoop. 
In this section, I go through both uses. 
Predicting y’s for the x’s in your sample
First, I use TREND to predict GPAs for the 20 students in the sample. 
Figure 14-9 shows TREND set up to do this. I include the Formula Bar in this 
screen shot so you can see what the formula looks like for this use of TREND.

 In the Known_x’s box, enter the name for the cell range that holds the 
scores for the x-variable. For this example, it’s SAT (C3:C22).
 
 I left the New_x’s box blank.
 
 In the Const box, I typed TRUE (or leave it blank) to calculate the y-inter-
cept, or type FALSE to set the y-intercept to zero.
 
 (I really don’t know why you’d enter FALSE.) A note of caution: In the 
dialog box, the instruction for the Const box refers to b. That’s the 
y-intercept. Earlier in the chapter, I use a to represent the y-intercept, 
and b to represent the slope. No particular usage is standard for this.

shows TREND set up for this, with the name New_SAT defined for the cell 
range that holds the new scores. The figure also shows the selected cell

Array function: LINEST 
LINEST combines SLOPE, INTERCEPT, and STEYX, and throws in a few extras. 
Figure 14-13 shows the Function Arguments dialog box for LINEST, along with 
the data and the selected array for the answers. Notice that it’s a five-row-by-
two-column array. For linear regression, that’s what the selected array has to 
be. How would you know the exact row-column dimensions of the array if I 
didn’t tell you? Well . . . you wouldn’t.

Part III: Drawing Conclusions from Data 
Here are the steps for using LINEST:
 
1. With the data entered, select a five-row-by-two-column array of cells 
for LINEST’s results.
 
 I selected G3:H7.
 
2. From the Statistical Functions menu, select LINEST to open the 
Function Arguments dialog box for LINEST.
 
3. In the Function Arguments dialog box, enter the appropriate values 
for the arguments.
 
 In the Known_y’s box, I entered the name of the cell range that holds the 
scores for the y-variable. For this example, that’s GPA (D3:D22). 
 
 In the Known_x’s box, I entered the name of the cell range that holds the 
scores for the x-variable. For this example, it’s SAT (C3:C22).
 
 In the Const box, the choices are to enter TRUE (or leave it blank) to 
 calculate the y-intercept, or FALSE to set the y-intercept to zero. .I 
entered TRUE. 
 
 In the Stats box, the choices are to enter TRUE to return regression sta-
tistics in addition to the slope and the intercept, or FALSE (or leave it 
blank) to return just the slope and the intercept. I entered TRUE.
 
 In the dialog box, b refers to intercept and m-coefficient refers to slope. 
As I said earlier, no set of symbols is standard for this.
 
4. IMPORTANT: Do NOT click OK. Because this is an array function, 
press Ctrl+Shift+Enter to put LINEST’s answers into the selected array.
Figure 14-14 shows LINEST’s results. They’re not labeled in any way, so I 
added the labels for you in the worksheet. The left column gives you the 
slope, standard error of the slope, something called “R Square,” F, and the 
SSregression. What’s R Square? That’s another measure of the strength of the 
relationship between SAT and GPA in the sample. I discuss it in detail in 
Chapter 15. 
The right column provides the intercept, standard error of the intercept, 
standard error of estimate, degrees of freedom, and SSresidual.

Data Analysis Tool: Regression 
Excel’s Regression data analysis tool does everything LINEST does (and 
more) and labels the output for you, too. Figure 14-15 shows the Regression

The steps for using this tool are:
 
1. Type the data into the worksheet, and include labels for the columns. 
 
2. Select Data | Data Analysis to open the Data Analysis dialog box.

278
Part III: Drawing Conclusions from Data 
 
3. In the Data Analysis dialog box, scroll down the Analysis Tools list 
and select Regression. Click OK to open the Regression dialog box.
 
 This is the dialog box in Figure 14-15.
 
4. In the Input Y Range box, enter the cell range that holds the data for 
the y-variable.
 
 For the example, the GPAs (including the label) are in $D$2:$D$22. Note 
the $-signs for absolute referencing. 
 
5. In the Input X Range box, enter the cell range that holds the data for 
the x-variable.
 
 The SATs (including the label) are in $C$2:$C$22.
 
6. If the cell ranges include column headings, check the Labels checkbox.
 
 I included the headings in the ranges, so I checked the box.
 
7. The Alpha box has 0.05 as a default. Change that value if you want a 
different alpha.
 
8. In the Output Options, select a radio button to indicate where you 
want the results.
 
 I selected New Worksheet Ply to put the results on a new page in the 
worksheet.
 
9. The Residuals area provides four capabilities for viewing the devia-
tions between the data points and the predicted points. Check as 
many as you like.
 
 I selected all four. I’ll explain them when I show you the output.
 
10. Select the Normal Probability Plots option if you want to produce a 
graph of the percentiles of the y-variable.
 
 I checked this one so I could show it to you in the output.
 
11. Click OK.
 
 Because I selected New Worksheet Ply, a newly created page opens with 
the results. 
 
A word about Steps 4 and 5: You’ll notice I didn’t enter the names for the 
cell ranges (GPA and SAT). Instead I entered the ranges ($D$2:$D$22 and 
$C$2:$C$22). Why? When I define a name for a cell range, I don’t include the 
cell that holds the name (for reasons I explain in Chapter 2). Following this 
practice, however, creates a small hurdle when you use a data analysis tool: 
You can’t check the Labels checkbox if the defined names aren’t in the named 
range. Checking that checkbox makes the variable names show up in the 
output — which is a good thing. So . . . I just enter the cell range including the 
name cell and check the Labels checkbox.

Tabled output
Figure 14-16 shows the upper half of the tool’s tabled output, after I expanded 
the columns. The title is SUMMARY OUTPUT. This part of the output features 
one table for Regression Statistics, another for ANOVA, and one for the 
regression coefficients. 
 
Figure 14-16: 
The upper 
half of the 
Regression 
data analy-
sis tool’s

The first three rows of the Regression Statistics table present information 
related to R2, a measure of the strength of the SAT-GPA relationship in the 
sample. The fourth row shows the standard error of estimate and the fifth 
gives the number of individuals in the sample.
The ANOVA table shows the results of testing
H0: σRegression ≤ σResidual
H1: σRegression > σResidual
If the value in the F-significance column is less than .05 (or whatever alpha 
level you’re using), reject H0. In this example, it’s less than .05.
Just below the ANOVA table is a table that gives the information on the 
regression coefficients. Excel doesn’t name it, but I refer to it as the coef-
ficients table. The Coefficients column provides the values for the intercept 
and the slope. The slope is labeled with the name of the x-variable. The 
Standard Error column presents the standard error of the intercept and the 
standard error of the slope. 
The remaining columns provide the results for the t-tests of the intercept and 
the slope. The P-value column lets you know whether or not to reject H0 for 
each test. If the value is less than your alpha, reject H0. In this example, the 
decision is to reject H0 for the slope, but not for the intercept.

Here, you find the RESIDUAL OUTPUT and the PROBABILITY OUTPUT. The 
RESIDUAL OUTPUT is a table that shows the predicted value and the residual 
(y-y’) for each individual in the sample. It also shows the standard residual for 
each observation, which is 
The tabled data on residuals and standard residuals are useful for analyzing 
the variability around the regression line. You can scan these data for outli-
ers, for example, and see if outliers are associated with particular values of 
the x-variable. (If they are, it might mean that something weird is going on in 
your sample.)
The PROBABILITY OUTPUT is a table of the percentiles in the y-variable data 
in the sample. (Yes, PERCENTILE OUTPUT would be a better name.)
Graphic output
Figures 14-18, 14-19, and 14-20 show the Regression tool’s graphic output. 
The Normal Probability Plot in Figure 14-18 is a graphic version of the 
PROBABILITY OUTPUT table. The SAT Residual Plot in Figure 14-19 shows 
the residuals graphed against the x-variable: For each SAT score in the 
sample, this plot shows the corresponding residual. Figure 14-20 shows the 
SAT Line Fit Plot — a look at the observed and the predicted y-values. Note 
that in the Line Fit Plot, the SATs do not appear on the x-axis in numerical 
order. Rather, they appear in the same order as in the data.

If you’ve used the Regression Tool in earlier versions of Excel, you’ll notice a 
change in the Normal Probability Plot and the Line Fit Plot. These two formerly 
appeared as scatterplots. In Excel 2007, they appear as column charts. You can 
use Excel’s graphics capabilities to easily reformat them to scatterplots. 
Juggling Many Relationships 
at Once: Multiple Regression
Linear regression is a great tool for making predictions. When you know the 
slope and the intercept of the line that relates two variables, you can take 
a new x-value and predict a new y-value. In the example I’ve been working 
through, you take a SAT score and predict a GPA for a Sahutsket University 
student.
What if you knew more than just the SAT score for each student? What if you 
had the student’s high-school average (on a 100 scale), and you could use 
that information, too? If you could combine SAT with HS average, you might 
have a more accurate predictor than just SAT alone.
When you work with more than one independent variable, you’re in the realm 
of multiple regression. As in linear regression, you find regression coefficients 
for the best-fitting line through a scatterplot. Once again, “best-fitting” means 
that the sum of the squared distances from the data points to the line is a 
minimum.
With two independent variables, however, you can’t show a scatterplot in 
two dimensions. You need three dimensions, and that becomes difficult to 
draw. Instead, I’ll just show you the equation of the regression line:
For the SAT-GPA example, that translates to
You can test hypotheses about the overall fit, and about all three of the 
regression coefficients. 
I won’t go through all the formulas for finding the coefficients, because that 
gets really complicated. Instead, I’ll go right to the Excel capabilities. 

283
 Chapter 14: Regression: Linear and Multiple
A couple of things to bear in mind before I proceed: 
 
✓ You can have any number of x-variables. I just use two in the upcoming 
example.
 
✓ Expect the coefficient for SAT to change from linear regression to mul-
tiple regression. Expect the intercept to change, too.
 
✓ Expect the standard error of estimate to decrease from linear regression 
to multiple regression. Because multiple regression uses more informa-
tion than linear regression, it reduces the error. 
Excel Tools for Multiple Regression
The good news about Excel’s multiple regression tools is that they’re the 
some of the same ones I just told you about for linear regression: You just 
use them in a slightly different way. 
The bad news is . . . well . . . uh . . . I can’t think of any bad news!
TREND revisited
I begin with TREND. Before, I showed you how to use this function to predict 
values based on one x-variable. Change what you enter into the dialog box, 
and it predicts values based on more than one. 
Figure 14-21 shows the TREND dialog box and data for 20 students. In the 
data, I’ve added a column for each student’s high-school average. I defined 
HS_Average as the name for the data in this column. The Figure also shows 
the selected column for TREND’s predictions. I include the Formula Bar in 
this screen shot so you can see what the formula looks like.
 
1. With the data entered, select a column for TREND’s answers.
 
 I selected F3:F22. That puts the predicted GPAs right next to the sample 
GPAs.
 
2. From the Statistical Functions menu, select TREND to open the 
Function Arguments dialog box for TREND.

3. In the Function Arguments dialog box, enter the appropriate values 
for the arguments.
 
 In the Known_y’s box, I entered the name of the cell range that holds the 
scores for the y-variable. For this example, that’s GPA (E3:E22). 
 
 In the Known_x’s box, I entered the names of the cell ranges that hold 
the scores for the x-variables. With the cell ranges named, it’s SAT:HS_
Average. These names cover C3:D22, the cells that hold the SAT scores 
and the high-school averages.
 
 I left the New_x’s box blank.
 
 In the Const box, the choices are TRUE (or leave it blank) to calculate 
the y-intercept, or FALSE to set the y-intercept to zero. I entered TRUE. (I 
really don’t know why you’d enter FALSE.) A note of caution: In the dialog 
box, the instruction for the Const box refers to b. That’s the y-intercept. 
Earlier in the chapter, I use a to represent the y-intercept, and b to repre-
sent the slope. No particular usage is standard for this. Also, the dialog 
box makes it sound like this function just works for linear regression. As 
you’re about to see, it works for multiple regression, too.
 
4. IMPORTANT: Do NOT click OK. Because this is an array function, press 
Ctrl+Shift+Enter to put TREND’s answers into the selected column. 
Figure 14-22 shows the answers in F3:F22. Note the difference in the Formula 
Bar from Figure 14-21 to Figure 14-22. After the function completes its work, 
Excel adds curly brackets to indicate an array formula.
So TREND predicts the values, and I haven’t even shown you how to find the 
coefficients yet!

LINEST revisited
To find the multiple regression coefficients, I turn again to LINEST. 
In Figure 14-23, I’ve put the data and the dialog box for LINEST, along with the 
data and the selected array for the answers. The selected array is five-rows-
by-three-columns. It’s always five rows. The number of columns is equal to 
the number of regression coefficients. For linear regression, it’s two— the 
slope and the intercept. For this case of multiple regression, it’s three.

286
Part III: Drawing Conclusions from Data 
Here are the steps for using LINEST for multiple regression with three 
 coefficients:
 
1. With the data entered, select a five-row-by-three-column array of cells 
for LINEST’s results.
 
 I selected H3:J7.
 
2. Click the Insert Function button to open the Insert Function dialog box.
 
3. In the Insert Function dialog box, select LINEST and click OK to open 
the Function Arguments dialog box for LINEST.
 
 In the Known_y’s box, enter the column that holds the scores for the 
y-variable. For this example, that’s E3:E22, the GPAs. 
 
 In the Known_x’s box, enter the columns that hold the scores for the 
x-variables .For this example, it’s C3:D22, the SAT scores and the high-
school averages.
 
 In the Const box, enter TRUE (or leave it blank) to calculate the y-intercept. 
Enter FALSE to set the y-intercept to zero. I typed TRUE. 
 
 In the Stats box, enter TRUE to return regression statistics in addition 
to the slope and the intercept, FALSE (or leave it blank) to return just 
the slope and the intercept. I entered TRUE. The dialog box refers to the 
intercept as b and to the other coefficients as m-coefficients. I use a to rep-
resent the slope and b to refer to the other coefficients. No set of symbols 
is standard. 
 
4. IMPORTANT: Do NOT click OK. Because this is an array function, 
press Ctrl+Shift+Enter to put LINEST’s answers into the selected array.
Figure 14-24 shows LINEST’s results. They’re not labeled in any way, so I 
added the labels for you in the worksheet. I also drew a box around part of 
the results to clarify what goes with what. 
The entries that stand out are the ugly #N/A symbols in the last three rows of 
the rightmost column. These indicate that LINEST doesn’t put anything into 
these cells.
The top two rows of the array provide the values and standard errors for the 
coefficients. I drew the box around those rows to separate them from the 
three remaining rows, which present information in a different way. Before I 
get to those rows, I’ll just tell you that the top row gives you the information 
for writing the regression equation:

287
 Chapter 14: Regression: Linear and Multiple
In terms of SAT, GPA, and high-school average, it’s:
The third row has R Square (a measure of the strength of the relationship 
between GPA and the other two variables, which I cover in Chapter 15) and 
the standard error of estimate. Compare the standard error of estimate for 
the multiple regression with the standard error for the linear regression, and 
you’ll see that the multiple one is smaller. (Never mind. I’ll do it for you. It’s 
.40 for the linear and 0.35 for the multiple.)
The fourth row shows the F-ratio that tests the hypothesis about whether 
or not the line is a good fit to the scatterplot, and the df for the denominator 
of the F. The df for the numerator (not shown) is the number of coefficients 
minus 1. You can use FINV to verify that this F with df = 2 and 17 is significant. 
The last row gives you SSRegression and SSResidual.

Regression data analysis tool revisited
In the same way you use TREND and LINEST for multiple regression, you use 
the Regression data analysis tool. Specify the appropriate array for the x-vari-
ables, and you’re off and running.
Here are the steps:
 
1. Type the data into the worksheet, and include labels for the columns. 
 
2. Select Data | Data Analysis to open the Data Analysis dialog box.

288
Part III: Drawing Conclusions from Data 
 
3. In the Data Analysis dialog box, scroll down the Analysis Tools list 
and select Regression. Click OK to open the Regression dialog box.
 
 This is the dialog box in Figure 14-15.
 
4. In the Input Y Range box, enter the cell range that holds the data for 
the y-variable.
 
 The GPAs (including the label) are in $E$2:$E$22. Note the $-signs for 
absolute referencing. 
 
5. In the Input X Range box, enter the cell range that holds the data for 
the x-variable.
 
 The SATs and the high-school averages (including the labels) are in 
$C$2:$D$22.
 
6. If the cell ranges include column headings, select the Labels checkbox.
 
 I included the labels in the ranges, so I selected the box.
 
7. The Alpha box has 0.05 as a default. Change that value if you want a 
different alpha.
 
 In the Output Options, select a radio button to indicate where you want 
the results.
 
8. I selected New Worksheet Ply to put the results on a new page in the 
worksheet.
 
9. The Residuals area provides four capabilities for viewing the devia-
tions between the data points and the predicted points. Select as many 
as you like.
 
 I selected all four. 
 
10. The option in the Normal Probability Plot area produces a graph of 
the percentiles of the y-variable.
 
 I checked this one.
 
11. Click OK.
Go back to the section, “Data Analysis Tool: Regression,” for the details of 
what’s in the output. It’s the same as before, with a couple of changes and 
additions because of the new variable. Figure 14-25 shows the ANOVA table 
and the coefficients table.
The ANOVA table shows the new df (2, 17, and 19 for Regression, Residual, 
and Total, respectively). The coefficients table adds information for the HS 
Average. It shows the values of all the coefficients, as well as standard errors, 
and t-test information for hypothesis testing.

Compare the absolute values of the residuals from the linear regression with 
the absolute values of the residuals from the multiple regression; you’ll see 
the multiple ones are smaller, on average.

I introduce you to the ups and downs of correlation, another tool for looking 
at relationships. 
I use the example of SAT and GPA from Chapter 14, and show how to think 
about the data in a slightly different way. The new concepts connect to what 
I showed you in the preceding chapter, and you’ll see how that works. I also 
show you how to test hypotheses about relationships and how to use Excel 
functions and data analysis tools for correlation.
Scatterplots Again
A scatterplot is a graphic way of showing a relationship between two vari-
ables. Figure 15-1 is a scatterplot that represents the GPAs and SAT scores of 
20 students at the fictional Sahusket University. The GPAs are on a 4.0 scale 
and the SATs are combined Verbal and Math. 
Each point represents one student. A point’s location in the horizontal direc-
tion represents the student’s SAT. That same point’s location in the vertical 
direction represents the student’s GPA.

Understanding Correlation
In Chapter 14, I refer to the SAT as the independent variable and to the GPA as 
the dependent variable. The objective in Chapter 14 was to use SAT to predict 
GPA. Here’s a very important point: Although I use scores on one variable to 
predict scores on the other, I do not mean that the score on one variable causes 
a score on the other. “Relationship” doesn’t necessarily mean “causality.” 
Correlation is a statistical way of looking at a relationship. When two things 
are correlated, it means that they vary together. Positive correlation means 
that high scores on one are associated with high scores on the other, and 
that low scores on one are associated with low scores on the other. The scat-
terplot in Figure 15-1 is an example of positive correlation.
Negative correlation, on the other hand, means that high scores on the first 
thing are associated with low scores on the second. Negative correlation 
also means that low scores on the first are associated with high scores on 
the second. An example is the correlation between body weight and the time 
spent on a weight-loss program. If the program is effective, the higher the 
amount of time spent on the program, the lower the body weight. Also, the 
lower the amount of time spent on the program, the higher the body weight. 
Table 15-1, a repeat of Table 14-2, shows the data from the scatterplot.

In keeping with the way I used SAT and GPA in Chapter 14, SAT is the x-vari-
able and GPA is the y-variable. 
The formula for calculating the correlation between the two is 

294
Part III: Drawing Conclusions from Data 
The term on the left, r, is called the correlation coefficient. It’s also called 
Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficient after its creator Karl Pearson. 
The two terms in the denominator on the right are the standard deviation of 
the x-variable and the standard deviation of the y-variable. The term in the 
numerator is called the covariance. So another way to write this formula is
The covariance represents x and y varying together. Dividing the covariance 
by the product of the two standard deviations imposes some limits. The 
lower limit of the correlation coefficient is –1.00, and the upper limit is +1.00. 
A correlation coefficient of –1.00 represents perfect negative correlation (low 
x-scores associated with high y-scores, and high x-scores associated with 
low y-scores.) A correlation of +1.00 represents perfect positive correlation 
(low x-scores associated with low y-scores and high x-scores associated with 
high y-scores.) A correlation of 0.00 means that the two variables are not 
related.
Applying the formula to the data in Table 15-1, 
What, exactly, does this number mean? I’m about to tell you.
Correlation and Regression
Figure 15.2 shows the scatterplot with the line that “best fits” the points. It’s 
possible to draw an infinite number of lines through these points. Which one 
is best?
To be “best,” a line has to meet a specific standard: If you draw the distances 
in the vertical direction between the points and the line, and you square 
those distances, and then you add those squared distances, the best fitting 
line is the one that makes the sum of those squared distances as small as 
possible. This line is called the regression line.

The regression line’s purpose in life is to enable you to make predictions. As I 
mention in Chapter 14, without a regression line your best predicted value of 
the y-variable is the mean of the y’s. A regression line takes the x-variable into 
account and delivers a more precise prediction. Each point on the regression 
line represents a predicted value for y. In the symbology of regression, each 
predicted value is a y’.
Why do I tell you all of this? Because correlation is closely related to regres-
sion. Figure 15-3 focuses on one point in the scatterplot, and its distance to 
the regression line and to the mean. (This is a repeat of Figure 14-3.)

Part III: Drawing Conclusions from Data 
Notice the three distances laid out in the Figure. The distance labeled (y-y’) 
is the difference between the point and the regression line’s prediction for 
where the point should be. (In Chapter 14, I call that a residual.) The distance 
labeled y- 
 is the difference between the point and the mean of the y’s. 
The distance labeled y’- 
 is the gain in prediction ability that you get from 
using the regression line to predict the point instead of using the mean. 
Figure 15-3 shows the three distances are related like this:
As I point out in Chapter 14, you can square all the residuals and add them, 
square all the deviations of the predicted points from the mean and add 
them, and square all the deviations of the actual points from the mean and 
add them, too. 
It turns out that these sums of squares are related in the same way as the 
deviations I just showed you:
If SSRegression is large in comparison to SSResidual, that indicates that the relation-
ship between the x-variable and the y-variable is a strong one. It means that 
throughout the scatterplot, the variability around the regression line is small. 
On the other hand, if SSRegression is small in comparison to SSResidual, that 
means that the relationship between the x-variable and the y-variable is weak. 
In this case, the variability around the regression line is large throughout the 
scatterplot.
One way to test SSRegression against SSResidual is to divide each by its degrees 
of freedom (1 for SSRegression and N-2 for SSResidual) to form variance estimates 
(also known as Mean Squares, or MS), and then divide one by the other to 
calculate an F. If MSRegression is significantly larger than MSResidual, you have evi-
dence that the x-y relationship is strong. (See Chapter 14 for details.)
Here’s the clincher, as far as correlation is concerned: Another way to 
assess the size of SSRegression is to compare it with SSTotal. Divide the first by 
the second. If the ratio is large, this tells you the x-y relationship is strong. 
This ratio has a name. It’s called the coefficient of determination. Its symbol is 
r2. Take the square root of this coefficient, and you have . . . the correlation 
 coefficient!

297
 Chapter 15: Correlation: The Rise and Fall of Relationships
The plus-or-minus sign (±) means that r is either the positive or negative 
square root, depending on whether the slope of the regression line is positive 
or negative.
So, if you calculate a correlation coefficient and you quickly want to know 
what its value signifies, just square it. The answer — the coefficient of deter-
mination — lets you know the proportion of the SSTotal that’s tied up in the 
relationship between the x-variable and the y-variable. If it’s a large propor-
tion, the correlation coefficient signifies a strong relationship. If it’s a small 
proportion, the correlation coefficient signifies a weak relationship. 
In the GPA-SAT example, the correlation coefficient is .817. The coefficient of 
determination is
In this sample of 20 students, the SSRegression is 66.7 percent of the SSTotal. 
Sounds like a large proportion, but what’s large? What’s small? Those ques-
tions scream out for hypothesis tests.
Testing Hypotheses About Correlation
In this section, I show you how to answer important questions about cor-
relation. Like any other kind of hypothesis testing, the idea is to use sample 
statistics to make inferences about population parameters. Here, the sample 
statistic is r, the correlation coefficient. By convention, the population param-
eter is ρ (rho), the Greek equivalent of r. (Yes, it does look like our letter p, 
but it really is the Greek equivalent of r.)
Two kinds of questions are important in connection with correlation: (1) Is a 
correlation coefficient greater than zero? (2) Are two correlation coefficients 
different from one another?
Is a correlation coefficient 
greater than zero?
Returning once again to the Sahusket SAT-GPA example, you can use the 
sample r to test hypotheses about the population ρ — the correlation coef-
ficient for all students at Sahusket University. 

298
Part III: Drawing Conclusions from Data 
Assuming we know in advance (before we gather any sample data), that any 
correlation between SAT and GPA should be positive, the hypotheses are:
H0: ρ ≤ 0
H1: ρ > 0
I set α = .05.
The appropriate statistical test is a t-test. The formula is:
This test has N-2 df.
For the example, the values in the numerator are set: r is .817 and ρ (in H0) is 
zero. What about the denominator? I won’t burden you with the details. I’ll 
just tell you that’s 
With a little algebra, the formula for the t-test simplifies to
For the example,
With df = 18 and α = .05 (one-tailed), the critical value of t is 2.10 (use the 
worksheet function TINV to check). Because the calculated value is greater 
than the critical value, the decision is to reject H0.
Do two correlation coefficients differ?
In a sample of 24 students at Farshimmelt College, the correlation between 
SAT and GPA is .752. Is this different from the correlation (.817) at Sahutsket 
University? If I have no way of assuming that one correlation should be 
higher than the other, the hypotheses are:

299
 Chapter 15: Correlation: The Rise and Fall of Relationships
H0: ρSahusket = ρFarshimmelt
H1: ρSahusket ≠ ρFarshimmelt
Again, α = .05.
For highly technical reasons, you can’t set up a t-test for this one. In fact, you 
can’t even work with .817 and .752, the two correlation coefficients.
Instead, what you do is transform each correlation coefficient into something 
else and then work with the two something elses in a formula that gives 
you — believe it or not — a z-test.
 
The transformation is called Fisher’s r to z transformation. Fisher is the statisti-
cian who’s remembered as the “F” in the F-test. He transforms the r into a z by 
doing this:
If you know what loge means, fine. If not, don’t worry about it. (I explain it in 
Chapter 20.) Excel takes care of all of this for you, as you see in a moment.
After you transform r to z, the formula is
The denominator turns out to be easier than you might think. It’s:
For this example,

The whole formula is
The next step is to compare the calculated value to a standard normal dis-
tribution. For a two-tailed test with α = .05 the critical values in a standard 
normal distribution are 1.96 in the upper tail and -1.96 in the lower tail. The 
calculated value falls in between those two, so the decision is to not reject H0.
Worksheet Functions for Correlation
Excel provides two worksheet functions for calculating correlation — and, 
they do exactly the same thing in exactly the same way! Why Excel offers 
both CORREL and PEARSON I do not know, but there you have it. Those are 
the two main correlation functions. 
The others are RSQ and COVAR. RSQ calculates the coefficient of determina-
tion (the square of the correlation coefficient), and COVAR calculates the 
covariance, sort of.
CORREL and PEARSON
Figure 15-4 shows the data for the Sahusket SAT-GPA example, along with the 
Function Arguments dialog box for CORREL.

 Chapter 15: Correlation: The Rise and Fall of Relationships
To use this function, the steps are:
 
1. Type the data into cell arrays and select a cell for CORREL’s answer.
 
 I’ve entered the SAT data into C3:C22 and the GPA data into D3:D22, and 
selected F15. I’ve defined SAT as the name of C3:C22 and GPA as the 
name of D3:D22. (Reread Chapter 2 to see how to do this.)
 
2. From the Statistical Functions menu, select CORREL to open its 
Function Arguments dialog box.
 
3. In the Function Arguments dialog box, enter the appropriate values 
for the arguments.
 
 In the Array 1 box, I entered SAT — the name I assigned to the cell range 
(C3:C22) that holds the scores for one of the variables. 
 
 In the Array 2 box, I entered GPA — the name I assigned the cell range 
(D3:D22) that holds the scores for the other variable.
 
 With values entered for each argument, the answer, 0.81662505, appears 
in the dialog box.
 
4. Click OK to put the answer into the selected cell.
 
 Selecting PEARSON instead of CORREL gives you exactly the same 
answer, and you use it exactly the same way.
Item analysis: A useful application of correlation
Instructors often want to know how perfor-
mance on a particular exam question is related 
to overall performance on the exam. Ideally, 
someone who knows the material answers 
the question correctly; someone who doesn’t 
answers it incorrectly. If everyone answers it 
correctly — or if no one does — it’s a useless 
question. This evaluation is called item analysis. 
Suppose it’s possible to answer the exam 
question either correctly or incorrectly, and 
it’s possible to score from 0 to 100 on the exam. 
Arbitrarily, you can assign a score of 0 for an 
incorrect answer to the question, and 1 for a 
correct answer, and then calculate a correla-
tion coefficient where each pair of scores is 
either 0 or 1 for the question and a number from 
0 to 100 for the exam. The score on the exam 
question is called a dichotomous variable, and 
this type of correlation is called point biserial 
correlation. 
If the point biserial correlation is high for an 
exam question, it’s a good idea to retain that 
question. If the correlation is low, the question 
probably serves no purpose.
Because one of the variables can only be 0 or 
1, the formula for the biserial correlation coef-
ficient is a bit different from the formula for the 
regular correlation coefficient. If you use Excel 
for the calculations, however, that doesn’t 
matter. Just use CORREL (or PEARSON) in the 
way I outline.

302
Part III: Drawing Conclusions from Data 
RSQ
If you have to quickly calculate the coefficient of determination (r2), RSQ is 
the function for you. I see no particular need for this function because it’s 
easy enough to use CORREL and then square the answer. 
Here’s what the EXCEL Formula Bar looks like after you fill in the RSQ 
Function Arguments dialog box for this example:
=RSQ(GPA,SAT)
In terms of the dialog box, the only difference between this one and CORREL 
(and PEARSON) is that the boxes you fill in are called Known_y’s and 
Known_x’s rather than Array 1 and Array 2. 
COVAR
This is another function for which I see no burning need. A minute ago I said 
COVAR calculates covariance “sort of.” I said that because the covariance I 
introduced earlier (as the numerator of the correlation coefficient) is
COVAR, however, calculates 
You use this function the same way you use CORREL. After you fill in its 
Function Arguments dialog box for this example, the formula in the formula 
bar is
=COVAR(SAT,GPA)
If you want to use this function to calculate r, you divide the answer by the 
product of STDEVP(SAT) and STDEVP(GPA). I don’t know why you’d bother 
with all of this when you can just use CORREL.

303
 Chapter 15: Correlation: The Rise and Fall of Relationships
Data Analysis Tool: Correlation
If you have to calculate a single correlation coefficient, you’ll find that Excel’s 
Correlation data analysis tool does the same thing CORREL does, although 
the output is in tabular form. This tool becomes useful when you have to cal-
culate multiple correlations on a set of data. 
For example, Figure 15-5 shows SAT, High School Average, and GPA for 20 
Sahusket University students, along with the dialog box for the Correlation 
data analysis tool.
 
Figure 15-5: 
The 
Correlation

box, along 
with data 
for SAT, 
High School 
Average, 
and GPA.
 
The steps for using this tool are:
 
1. Type the data into the worksheet and include labels for the columns.
 
 In this example, the data (including labels) are in C2:E22. 
 
2. Select Data | Data Analysis to open the Data Analysis dialog box.
 
3. In the Data Analysis dialog box, scroll down the Analysis Tools list 
and select Correlation. Click OK to open the Correlation dialog box.
 
 This is the dialog box in Figure 15-5.
 
4. In the Input Range box, enter the cell range that holds all the data.
 
 I entered $C$2:$E$22. Note the $-signs for absolute referencing. 
 
5. To the right of Grouped By, select a radio button to indicate if the data 
are organized in columns or rows.
 
 I chose the Columns radio button.

304
Part III: Drawing Conclusions from Data 
 
6. If the cell ranges include column headings, check the Labels checkbox.
 
 I included the headings in the ranges, so I checked the box.
 
7. In the Output Options, select a radio button to indicate where you 
want the results.
 
 I selected New Worksheet Ply to put the results on a new page in the 
worksheet.
 
8. Click OK.
 
 Because I selected New Worksheet Ply, a newly created page opens with 
the results. 
Tabled output
Figure 15-6 shows the tool’s tabled output, after I expanded the columns. The 
table is a correlation matrix.
 
Figure 15-6: 
The 
Correlation 
data analy-
sis tool’s 
tabled 
 output.
 
Each cell in the matrix represents the correlation of the variable in the row 
with the variable in the column. Cell B3 presents the correlation of SAT with 
High School Average, for example. Each cell in the main diagonal contains 1. 
This is because each main diagonal cell represents the correlation of a vari-
able with itself. 
It’s only necessary to fill in half the matrix. The cells above the main diagonal 
would contain the same values as the cells below the main diagonal.
What does this table tell you, exactly? Read on. . . . 
Multiple correlation
The correlation coefficients in this matrix combine to produce a multiple 
correlation coefficient. This is a number that summarizes the relationship 

305
 Chapter 15: Correlation: The Rise and Fall of Relationships
between the dependent variable — GPA in this example — and the two inde-
pendent variables (SAT and High School Average). 
To show you how these correlation coefficients combine, I abbreviate GPA 
as G, SAT as S, and High School Average as H. So rGS is the correlation coef-
ficient for GPA and SAT, rGH is the correlation coefficient for GPA and High 
School Average, and rSH is the correlation coefficient for SAT and High 
School Average. 
Here’s the formula that puts them all together:
The uppercase R on the left indicates that this is a multiple correlation coeffi-
cient, as opposed to the lowercase r that indicates a correlation between two 
variables. The subscript G.SH means that the multiple correlation is between 
GPA and the combination of SAT and High School Average.
This is the calculation that produces Multiple R in the Regression Statistics 
section of the Regression data analysis tool’s results. (See Chapter 14.)
For this example, 
Because I use the same data to show you multiple regression in Chapter 14, 
this value (with some additional decimal places) is in Figure 14-25, in cell B4.
If you square this number, you get the multiple coefficient of determination. In 
Chapter 14, I tell you about R Square, and that’s what this is. It’s another item 
in the Regression Statistics that the Regression data analysis tool calculates. 
You also find it in LINEST’s results, although it’s not labeled.
For this example, that result is:
You can go back and see this number in Figure 14-24 in cell H5 (the LINEST 
results). You can also see it in Figure 14-25, cell B5 (the Regression data anal-
ysis tool report).

306
Part III: Drawing Conclusions from Data 
Partial correlation
GPA and SAT are associated with High School Average (in the example). Each 
one’s association with High School Average might somehow hide the true 
correlation between them. 
What would their correlation be if you could remove that association? 
Another way to say this: What would be the GPA-SAT correlation if you could 
hold High School Average constant? 
One way to hold High School Average constant is to find the GPA-SAT cor-
relation for a sample of students who have one High School Average — 87, 
for example. In a sample like that, the correlation of each variable with High 
School Average is zero. This usually isn’t feasible in the real world, however. 
Another way is to find the partial correlation between GPA and SAT. This is 
a statistical way of removing each variable’s association with High School 
Average in your sample. You use the correlation coefficients in the correla-
tion matrix to do this:
Adjusting R2
Here’s some more information about R2 as it 
relates to Excel. In addition to R2 — or as Excel 
likes to write it, R Square — the Regression data 
analysis tool calculates Adjusted R Square. In 
Figure 14-21, it’s in cell B6. Why is it necessary 
to “adjust” R Square? 
In multiple regression, adding independent vari-
ables (like High School Average) sometimes 
makes the regression equation less accurate. 
The multiple coefficient of determination, R 
Square, doesn’t reflect this. Its denomina-
tor is SSTotal (for the dependent variable) and 
that never changes. The numerator can only 
increase or stay the same. So any decline in 
accuracy doesn’t result in a lower R Square.
Taking degrees of freedom into account fixes 
the flaw. Every time you add an independent 
variable, you change the degrees of freedom 
and that makes all the difference. Just so you 
know, here’s the adjustment:
 
 
The k in the denominator is the number of inde-
pendent variables.

307
 Chapter 15: Correlation: The Rise and Fall of Relationships
Once again, G stands for GPA, S for SAT, and H for High School Average. The 
subscript GS.H means that the correlation is between GPA and SAT with High 
School Average “partialled out.”
For this example, 
Semipartial correlation
It’s also possible to remove the correlation with High School Average from 
just SAT without removing it from GPA. This is called semipartial correlation. 
The formula for this one also uses the correlation coefficients from the cor-
relation matrix:
The subscript G(S.H) means the correlation is between GPA and SAT with 
High School Average “partialled out” of SAT only.
Applying this formula to the example,
 
Some statistics textbooks refer to semipartial correlation as part correlation.
Data Analysis Tool: Covariance
You use the Covariance data analysis tool the same way you use the 
Correlation data analysis tool. I won’t go through the steps again. Instead, I’ll 
just show you the tabled output in Figure 15-7. The data are from Figure 15-5.
The table is a covariance matrix. Each cell in the matrix shows the covari-
ance of the variable in the row with the variable in the column (again, using 
N rather than N-1). Cell C4 shows the covariance of GPA with High School 
Average. The main diagonal in this matrix presents the variance of each vari-
able (which is equivalent to the covariance of a variable with itself). In this 
case, the variance is what you compute if you use VARP.

Again, it’s only necessary to fill half the matrix. Cells above the main diagonal 
would hold the same values as the cells below the main diagonal.
As is the case with COVAR, I don’t see why you’d use this tool. I just include 
it for completeness.
Testing Hypotheses About Correlation
Excel has no worksheet function for testing hypotheses about r. As I pointed 
out before, you perform a t-test whose formula is:
With 0.817 stored in cell H12, I used this formula to calculate t:
=H12*SQRT(20-2)/SQRT(1-H12^2) 
I then used the answer (6.011 and some additional decimal places) as input 
to TDIST (along with 18 df and 1 tail) to find that the one-tailed probability of 
the result is way less than .05.
Worksheet Functions: FISHER, FISHERINV
Excel handles the rather complex transformations that enable you to test 
hypotheses about the difference between two correlation coefficients. FISHER 

309
 Chapter 15: Correlation: The Rise and Fall of Relationships
transforms r to z. FISHERINV does the reverse. Just to refresh your memory, 
you use the transformed values in the formula
in which the denominator is
In the example I discussed earlier (Sahusket versus Farshimmelt), the corre-
lation coefficients were .817 and .752, and I did a two-tailed test. The first step 
is to transform each correlation. I’ll go through the steps for using FISHER to 
transform .817:
 
1. Select a cell for FISHER’s answer.
 
 I selected B3 for the transformed value.
 
2. From the Statistical Functions menu, select FISHER to open its 
Function Arguments dialog box.
 
 The FISHER Function Arguments dialog box appears in Figure 15-8.

3. In the Function Arguments dialog box, type the appropriate value for 
the argument.
 
 In the x box, I typed .817, the correlation coefficient. The answer, 
1.147728, appears in the dialog box.
 
4. Click OK to put the answer into the selected cell.

310
Part III: Drawing Conclusions from Data 
I selected B4 to store the transformation of .752. Next, I used this formula to 
calculate Z
=(B3-B4)/SQRT((1/(20-3))+(1/(24-3)))
Finally, I used NORMSINV to find the critical value of z for rejecting H0 with a 
two-tailed α of .05. Because the result of the formula (0.521633) is less than 
that critical value (1.96), the decision is to not reject H0.

tatistical analysis and decision-making rest on a foun-
dation of probability. Throughout the book, I give 
a smattering of probability ideas — just enough to get 
you through the statistics. Part IV gives a more in-depth 
treatment and covers related Excel features. You find out 
about discrete and continuous random variables, count-
ing rules, conditional probability, and probability distribu-
tions. In this part, I also discuss specific probability 
distributions that are appropriate for specific purposes. 
Part IV ends with an exploration of modeling, tests of how 
well a model fits data, and how Excel deals with modeling 
and testing.

T
hroughout this book, I toss around the concept of probability, because 
it’s the basis of hypothesis testing and inferential statistics. Most of the 
time, I represent probability as the proportion of area under part of a distri-
bution. For example, the probability of a Type I error (a/k/a α) is the area in a 
tail of the standard normal distribution or the t distribution.
In this chapter, I explore probability in greater detail, including random vari-
ables, permutations, and combinations. I examine probability’s fundamentals 
and applications, zero in on a couple of specific probability distributions, and 
I discuss probability-related Excel worksheet functions.
What is Probability?
Most of us have an intuitive idea about what probability is all about. Toss 
a fair coin, and you have a 50-50 chance it comes up “Head.” Toss a fair die 
(one of a pair of dice) and you have a one-in-six chance it comes up “2.” 
If you wanted to be more formal in your definition, you’d most likely say 
something about all the possible things that could happen, and the propor-
tion of those things you care about. Two things can happen when you toss a 
coin, and if you only care about one of them (Head), the probability of that 
event happening is one out of two. Six things can happen when you toss a 
die, and if you only care about one of them (2), the probability of that event 
happening is one out of six. 

314
Part IV: Working with Probability 
Experiments, trials, events, 
and sample spaces
Statisticians and others who work with probability refer to a process like 
tossing a coin or throwing a die as an experiment. Each time you go through 
the process, that’s a trial. 
This might not fit your personal definition of an experiment (or of a trial, for 
that matter), but for a statistician, an experiment is any process that pro-
duces one of at least two distinct results (like a Head or a Tail). 
Another piece of the definition of an experiment: You can’t predict the result 
with certainty. Each distinct result is called an elementary outcome. Put a 
bunch of elementary outcomes together and you have an event. For example, 
with a die the elementary outcomes 2, 4, and 6 make up the event “even 
number.” 
Put all the possible elementary outcomes together and you’ve got yourself a 
sample space. The numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 make up the sample space for a 
die. “Head” and “Tail” make up the sample space for a coin.
Sample spaces and probability
How does all this play into probability? If each elementary outcome in a 
sample space is equally likely, the probability of an event is
So the probability of tossing a die and getting an even number is
If the elementary outcomes are not equally likely, you find the probability of 
an event in a different way. First, you have to have some way of assigning a 
probability to each one. Then you add up the probabilities of the elementary 
outcomes that make up the event. 
A couple of things to bear in mind about outcome probabilities: Each prob-
ability has to be between zero and one. All the probabilities of elementary 
outcomes in a sample space have to add up to 1.00.

315
 Chapter 16: Introducing Probability
How do you assign those probabilities? Sometimes you have advance infor-
mation — such as knowing that a coin is biased toward coming up Head 60 
percent of the time. Sometimes you just have to think through the situation 
to figure out the probability of an outcome. 
Here’s a quick example of “thinking through.” Suppose a die is biased so that 
the probability of an outcome is proportional to the numerical label of the out-
come: A 6 comes up six times as often as a 1, a 5 comes up five times as often 
as a 1, and so on. What is the probability of each outcome? All the probabilities 
have to add up to 1.00, and all the numbers on a die add up to 21 (1+2+3+4+5+
6 = 21), so the probabilities are: pr(1) = 1/21, pr(2) = 2/21, . . ., pr(6) = 6/21.
Compound Events
Some rules for dealing with compound events help you “think through.” A 
compound event consists of more than one event. It’s possible to combine 
events by either union or intersection (or both).
Union and intersection
On a toss of a fair die, what’s the probability of getting a 1 or a 4? 
Mathematicians have a symbol for “or.” It looks like this , and it’s called 
“union.” Using this symbol, the probability of a 1 or a 4 is pr(1 , 4).
In approaching this kind of probability, it’s helpful to keep track of the ele-
mentary outcomes. One elementary outcome is in each event, so the event 
“1 or 4” has two elementary outcomes. With a sample space of six outcomes, 
the probability is 2/6 or 1/3. Another way to calculate this is 
pr(1 , 4) = pr(1) + pr(4) = (1/6) + (1/6) = 2/6 = 1/3
Here’s a slightly more involved one: What’s the probability of getting a 
number between 1 and 3 or a number between 2 and 4? 
Just adding the elementary outcomes in each event won’t get it done this 
time. Three outcomes are in the event “between 1 and 3” and three are in the 
event “between 2 and 4.” The probability can’t be 3 + 3 divided by the six out-
comes in the sample space because that’s 1.00, leaving nothing for pr(5) and 
pr(6). For the same reason, you can’t just add the probabilities.

316
Part IV: Working with Probability 
The challenge arises in the overlap of the two events. The elementary out-
comes in “between 1 and 3” are 1, 2, and 3. The elementary outcomes in 
“between 2 and 4” are 2, 3, and 4. Two outcomes overlap: 2 and 3. In order to 
not count them twice, the trick is to subtract them from the total. 
A couple of things will make life easier as I proceed. I abbreviate “between 1 
and 3” as A and “between 2 and 4” as B. Also, I use the mathematical symbol 
for “overlap.” The symbol is + and it’s called intersection.
Using the symbols, the probability of “between 1 and 3” or “between 2 and 4” is 
You can also work with the probabilities:
The general formula is:
Why was it okay to just add the probabilities together in the earlier example? 
Because 
 is zero: It’s impossible to get a 1 and a 4 in the same toss of 
a die. Whenever 
, A and B are said to be mutually exclusive.
Intersection again
Imagine throwing a coin and rolling a die at the same time. These two experi-
ments are independent, because the result of one has no influence on the 
result of the other. 
What’s the probability of getting a Head and a 4? You use the intersection 
symbol and write this as pr(Head 4):
Start with the sample space. Table 16-1 lists all the elementary outcomes.

317
 Chapter 16: Introducing Probability

Head, 2
Tail, 2
Head, 3
Tail, 3
Head, 4
Tail, 4
Head, 5
Tail, 5
Head, 6
Tail, 6
As the table shows, 12 outcomes are possible. How many outcomes are in the 
event “Head and 4”? Just one. So
You can also work with the probabilities:
In general, if A and B are independent,
Conditional Probability
In some circumstances, you narrow the sample space. For example, suppose 
I toss a die, and I tell you the result is greater than 2. What’s the probability 
that it’s a 5? 
Ordinarily, the probability of a 5 would be 1/6. In this case, however, the sample 
space isn’t 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. When you know the result is greater than 2, the 
sample space becomes 3, 4, 5, and 6. The probability of a 5 is now 
1⁄4.
This is an example of conditional probability. It’s “conditional” because I’ve 
given a “condition” — the toss resulted in a number greater than 2. The nota-
tion for this is 

318
Part IV: Working with Probability 
The vertical line is shorthand for the word given, and you read that notation 
as “the probability of a 5 given Greater than 2.”
Working with the probabilities
In general, if you have two events A and B,
as long as pr(B) isn’t zero.
For the intersection in the numerator on the right, this is not a case where you 
just multiply probabilities together. In fact, if you could do that, you wouldn’t 
have a conditional probability, because that would mean A and B are inde-
pendent. If they’re independent, one event can’t be conditional on the other. 
You have to think through the probability of the intersection. In a die, how 
many outcomes are in the event “5  Greater than 2”? Just one, so pr(5 
Greater than 2) is 
1⁄6, and 
The foundation of hypothesis testing
All the hypothesis testing I’ve gone through in previous chapters involves 
conditional probability. When you calculate a sample statistic, compute a sta-
tistical test, and then compare the test statistic against a critical value, you’re 
looking for a conditional probability. Specifically, you’re trying to find 
If that conditional probability is low (less than .05 in all the examples I show 
you in hypothesis-testing chapters), you reject H0.
Large Sample Spaces
When dealing with probability, it’s important to understand the sample 
space. In the examples I show you, the sample spaces are small. With a coin 
or a die, it’s easy to list all the elementary outcomes.

319
 Chapter 16: Introducing Probability
The world, of course, isn’t that simple. In fact, probability problems that 
live in statistics textbooks aren’t even that simple. Most of the time, sample 
spaces are large and it’s not convenient to list every elementary outcome. 
Take, for example, rolling a die twice. How many elementary outcomes are in 
the sample space consisting of both tosses? You can sit down and list them, 
but it’s better to reason it out: Six possibilities for the first toss, and each 
of those six can pair up with six possibilities on the second. So the sample 
space has 6 × 6 = 36 possible elementary outcomes. (This is similar to the 
coin-and-die sample space in Table 16-1, where the sample space consists of 
2 × 6 = 12 elementary outcomes. With 12 outcomes, it was easy to list them all 
in a table. With 36 outcomes, it starts to get . . . well . . . dicey.)
Events often require some thought, too. What’s the probability of rolling a die 
twice and totaling five? You have to count the number of ways the two tosses 
can total five, and then divide by the number of elementary outcomes in the 
sample space (36). You total a five by getting any of these pairs of tosses: 1 
and 4, 2 and 3, 3 and 2, or 4 and 1. That’s four ways and they don’t overlap 
(excuse me, intersect), so 
Listing all the elementary outcomes for the sample space is often a night-
mare. Fortunately, shortcuts are available, as I show in the upcoming sub-
sections. Because each shortcut quickly helps you count a number of items, 
another name for a shortcut is a counting rule. 
Believe it or not, I just slipped one counting rule past you. A couple of para-
graphs ago, I say that in two tosses of a die you have a sample space of 6 × 6 
= 36 possible outcomes. This is the product rule: If N1 outcomes are possible 
on the first trial of an experiment, and N2 outcomes on the second trial, the 
number of possible outcomes is N1N2. Each possible outcome on the first trial 
can associate with all possible outcomes on the second. What about three 
trials? That’s N1N2N3.
Now for a couple more counting rules.
Permutations 
Suppose you have to arrange five objects into a sequence. How many ways 
can you do that? For the first position in the sequence, you have five choices. 
After you make that choice, you have four choices for the second position. 
Then you have three choices for the third, two for the fourth, and one for the 
fifth. The number of ways is (5)(4)(3)(2)(1) = 120.

In general, the number of sequences of N objects is N(N-1)(N-2)…(2)(1). This 
kind of computation occurs fairly frequently in probability-world and it has 
its own notation, N! You don’t read this by screaming out “N” in a loud voice. 
Instead, it’s “N factorial.” By definition, 1! = 1, and 0! = 1.
Now for the good stuff. If you have to order the 26 letters of the alphabet, the 
number of possible sequences is 26!, a huge number. But suppose the task is 
to create five-letter sequences so that no letter repeats in the sequence. How 
many ways can you do that? You have 26 choices for the first letter, 25 for 
the second, 24 for the third, 23 for the fourth, 22 for the fifth, and that’s it. So 
that’s (26)(25(24)(23)(22). Here’s how that product is related to 26!:
Each sequence is called a permutation. In general, if you take permutations of 
N things r at a time, the notation is NPr (the P stands for “permutation”). The 
formula is
Combinations
In the example I just showed you, these sequences are different from one 
another: abcde, adbce, dbcae, and on and on and on. In fact, you could come up 
with 5! = 120 of these different sequences just for the letters a, b, c, d, and e.
Suppose I add the restriction that one of these sequences is no different from 
another, and all I’m concerned about is having sets of five nonrepeating let-
ters in no particular order. Each set is called a combination. For this example, 
the number of combinations is the number of permutations divided by 5!:
In general, the notation for combinations of N things taken r at a time is NCr 
(the C stands for “combination”). The formula is

Worksheet Functions 
Three Excel functions help you with factorials, permutations, and combina-
tions. Excel categorizes one of them as a Statistical function, but, surpris-
ingly, not the other two. 
FACT
FACT, which computes factorials, is one of the functions not categorized as 
Statistical. Instead, you’ll find it in the Math & Trig Functions menu. It’s easy 
to use. Supply it with a number, and it returns the factorial. Here are the steps:
 
1. Select a cell for FACT’s answer.
 
2. From the Math & Trig functions menu, select FACT to open its 
Function Arguments dialog box.
 
3. In the Function Arguments dialog box, enter the appropriate value for 
the argument. 
 
 In the Number box, I typed the number whose factorial I want to compute.
 
 The answer appears in the dialog box. If I enter 5, for example, 120 appears.
 
4. Click OK to put the answer into the selected cell.
PERMUT
You’ll find this one in the Statistical Functions menu. As its name suggests, 
PERMUT enables you to calculate NPr. Here’s how to use it to find 26P5, the 
number of five-letter sequences (no repeating letters) you can create from 
the 26 letters of the alphabet. In a permutation, remember, abcde is consid-
ered different from bcdae. Follow these steps:
 
1. Select a cell for PERMUT’s answer.
 
2. From the Statistical Functions menu, select PERMUT to open its 
Function Arguments dialog box (Figure 16-1).
 
3. In the Function Arguments dialog box, type the appropriate values for 
the arguments.
 
 In the Number box, I entered the N in NPr. For this example, N is 26. 
 
 In the Number_chosen box, I entered the r in NPr. That would be 5. 
 
 With values entered for both arguments, the answer appears in the 
dialog box. For this example, the answer is 7893600.

COMBIN 
COMBIN works pretty much the same way as PERMUT. Excel categorizes 
COMBIN as a Math & Trig function. 
Here’s how you use it to find 26C5, the number of ways to construct a 5-letter 
sequence (no repeating letters) from the 26 letters of the alphabet. In a com-
bination, abcde is considered equivalent to bcdae.
 
1. Select a cell for COMBIN’s answer.
 
2. From the Math & Trig Functions menu, select COMBIN to open its 
Function Arguments dialog box.
 
3. In the Function Arguments dialog box, type the appropriate values for 
the arguments.
 
 In the Number box, I entered the N in NCr. Once again, N is 26. 
 
 In the Number_chosen box, I entered the r in NCr. And again, r is 5.
 
 With values entered for both arguments, the answer appears in the 
dialog box. For this example, the answer is 65870.

Random Variables: Discrete 
and Continuous
Return to tosses of a fair die, where six elementary outcomes are possible. If I 
use x to refer to the result of a toss, x can be any whole number from 1 to 6. 

323
 Chapter 16: Introducing Probability
Because x can take on a set of values, it’s a variable. Because x’s possible 
values correspond to the elementary outcomes of an experiment (meaning you 
can’t predict its values with absolute certainty) x is called a random variable.
Random variables come in two varieties. One variety is discrete, of which die-
tossing is a good example. A discrete random variable can only take on what 
mathematicians like to call a countable number of values — like the numbers 
1–6. Values between the whole numbers 1–6 (like 1.25 or 3.1416) are impos-
sible for a random variable that corresponds to the outcomes of die-tosses.
The other kind of random variable is continuous. A continuous random vari-
able can take on an infinite number of values. Temperature is an example. 
Depending on the precision of a thermometer, it’s possible to have tempera-
tures like 34.516 degrees.
Probability Distributions 
and Density Functions
Back again to die-tossing. Each value of the random variable x (1–6, remem-
ber) has a probability. If the die is fair, each probability is 1/6. Pair each value 
of a discrete random variable like x with its probability, and you have a prob-
ability distribution. 
Probability distributions are easy enough to represent in graphs. Figure 16-2 
shows the probability distribution for x.

Part IV: Working with Probability 
A random variable has a mean, a variance, and a standard deviation. 
Calculating these parameters is pretty straightforward. In random-variable 
world, the mean is called the expected value, and the expected value of 
random variable x is abbreviated as E(x). Here’s how you calculate it:
For the probability distribution in Figure 16-2, that’s
The variance of a random variable is often abbreviated as V(x), and the for-
mula is
Working with the probability distribution in Figure 16-2 once again,
The standard deviation is the square root of the variance, which in this case 
is 1.708.
For continuous random variables, things get a little trickier. You can’t pair a 
value with a probability, because you can’t really pin down a value. Instead, 
you associate a continuous random variable with a mathematical rule (an 
equation) that generates probability density, and the distribution is called a 
probability density function. To calculate the mean and variance of a continu-
ous random variable, you need calculus.
In Chapter 8, I show you a probability density function — the standard 
normal distribution. I reproduce it here as Figure 16-3.
In the figure, f(x) represents the probability density. Because probability den-
sity can involve some heavyweight mathematical concepts, I won’t go into 
it. As I mention in Chapter 8, think of probability density as something that 
turns the area under the curve into probability. 
While you can’t speak of the probability of a specific value of a continuous 
random variable, you can work with the probability of an interval. To find 
the probability that the random variable takes on a value within an interval, 
you find the proportion of the total area under the curve that’s inside that 
interval. Figure 16-3 shows this. The probability that x is between 0 and 1σ 
is .3413.

For the rest of this chapter, I deal just with discrete random variables. A spe-
cific one is up next.
The Binomial Distribution
Imagine an experiment that has these five characteristics:
 
✓ The experiment consists of N identical trials.
 
 A trial could be a toss of a die, or a toss of a coin.
 
✓ Each trial results in one of two elementary outcomes.
 
✓ It’s standard to call one outcome a success and the other a failure. For 
die-tossing, a success might be a toss that comes up 3, in which case a 
failure is any other outcome.
 
✓ The probability of a success remains the same from trial to trial.
 
 Again, it’s pretty standard to use p to represent the probability of a suc-
cess, and 1-p (or q) to represent the probability of a failure.
 
✓ The trials are independent.
 
✓ The discrete random variable x is the number of successes in the N trials.

326
Part IV: Working with Probability 
This type of experiment is called a binomial experiment. The probability dis-
tribution for x follows this rule:
On the extreme right, px(1-p)N-x is the probability of one combination of x 
successes in N trials. The term to its immediate left is NCx, the number of 
possible combinations of x successes in N trials. 
This is called the binomial distribution. You use it to find probabilities like the 
probability you’ll get four 3s in ten tosses of a die:
The negative binomial distribution is closely related. In this distribution, the 
random variable is the number of trials before the xth success. For example, 
you use the negative binomial to find the probability of 5 tosses that result in 
anything but a 3 before the fourth time you roll a 3. 
For this to happen, in the eight tosses before the fourth 3, you have to get 
5 non-3s and 3 successes (tosses when a 3 comes up). Then, the next toss 
results in a 3. The probability of a combination of 4 successes and 5 failures 
is p4(1-p)5. The number of ways you can have a combination of 5 failures and 
4-1 successes is 5+4-1C4-1. So the probability is
In general, the negative binomial distribution (sometimes called the Pascal 
distribution) is
Worksheet Functions 
These distributions are computation intensive, so I get to the worksheet func-
tions right away. 

327
 Chapter 16: Introducing Probability
BINOMDIST 
BINOMDIST is Excel’s worksheet function for the binomial distribution. As an 
example, I use BINOMDIST to calculate the probability of getting four 3s in 
ten tosses of a fair die:
 
1. Select a cell for BINOMDIST’s answer.
 
2. From the Statistical Functions menu, select BINOMDIST to open its 
Function Arguments dialog box (Figure 16-4).
 
Figure 16-4: 
The 
BINOMDIST 
Function

3. In the Function Arguments dialog box, type the appropriate values for 
the arguments.
 
 In the Number_s box, I entered the number of successes. For this exam-
ple, the number of successes is 4.
 
 In the Trials box, I entered the number of trials. The number of trials is 10.
 
 In the Probability_s box, I entered the probability of a success. I entered 
1/6, the probability of a 3 on a toss of a fair die.
 
 In the Cumulative box, one possibility is FALSE for the probability of 
exactly the number of successes entered in the Number_s box. The 
other is TRUE for the probability of getting that number of successes or 
fewer. I entered FALSE. 
 
 With values entered for all the arguments, the answer appears in the 
dialog box.
 
4. Click OK to put the answer into the selected cell.
To give you a better idea of what the binomial distribution looks like, I use 
BINOMDIST (with FALSE entered in the Cumulative box) to find pr(0) through 

328
Part IV: Working with Probability 
pr(10), and then I use Excel’s graphics capabilities (see Chapter 3) to graph 
the results. Figure 16-5 shows the data and the graph.
 
Figure 16-5: 
The 
binomial

for x suc-
cesses in

of a die, 
with p = 1/6.
 
Incidentally, if you type TRUE in the Cumulative box, the result is .984 (and 
some more decimal places), which is pr(0) + pr(1) + pr(2) + pr(3) + pr(4). 
NEGBINOMDIST
As its name suggests, NEGBINOMDIST handles the negative binomial distribu-
tion. I use it here to work out the example I gave you earlier — the probabil-
ity of getting five failures (tosses that result in anything but a 3) before the 
fourth success (the fourth 3). 
 
1. Select a cell for NEGBINOMDIST’s answer.

ple, that’s 4.

dialog box. The answer is 0.017 and some additional decimal places.
 
4. Click OK to put the answer into the selected cell.
Hypothesis Testing with the 
Binomial Distribution
Hypothesis tests sometimes involve the binomial distribution. Typically, you 
have some idea about the probability of a success, and you put that idea into 
a null hypothesis. Then you perform N trials and record the number of suc-
cesses. Finally, you compute the probability of getting that many successes 
or a more extreme amount if your H0 is true. If the probability is low, reject H0.
When you test in this way, you’re using sample statistics to make an infer-
ence about a population parameter. Here, that parameter is the probability of 
a success in the population of trials. By convention, Greek letters represent 
parameters. Statisticians use π (pi), the Greek equivalent of p, to stand for the 
probability of a success in the population. 
Continuing with the die-tossing example, suppose you have a die and you 
want to test whether or not it’s fair. You suspect that if it’s not, it’s biased 
toward 3. Define a toss that results in 3 as a success. You toss it 10 times. 
Four tosses are successes. Casting all this into hypothesis-testing terms:
H0: π ≤ 1/6
H1: π > 1/6
As I usually do, I set α = .05
To test these hypotheses, you have to find the probability of getting at least 4 
successes in 10 tosses with p = 1/6. That probability is pr(4) + pr(5) + pr(6) + 
pr(7) + pr(8) + pr(9) + pr(10). If the total is less than .05, reject H0. 

330
Part IV: Working with Probability 
That’s a lot of calculating. You can use BINOMDIST to take care of it all (as 
I did when I set up the worksheet in Figure 16-5), or you can take a different 
route. You can find a critical value for the number of successes, and if the 
number of successes is greater than the critical value, reject H0.
How do you find the critical value? You can use a convenient worksheet func-
tion that I’m about to show you. 
CRITBINOM
This function is tailor-made for binomial-based hypothesis testing. Give 
CRITBINOM the number of trials, the probability of a success, and a crite-
rion cumulative probability. CRITBINOM returns the smallest value of x (the 
number of successes) for which the cumulative probability is greater than or 
equal to the criterion. 
Here are the steps for the hypothesis testing example I just showed you:
 
1. Select a cell for CRITBINOM’s answer.
 
2. From the Statistical Functions menu, select CRITBINOM and click OK 
to open its Function Arguments dialog box (Figure 16-7).
 
Figure 16-7:

CRITBINOM

3. In the Function Arguments dialog box, enter the appropriate values 
for the arguments.
 
 In the Trials box, I entered 10, the number of trials.
 
 In the Probability_s box, I entered the probability of a success. In this 
example it’s 1/6, the value of π according to H0.
 
 In the Alpha box, I entered the cumulative probability to exceed. I 
entered .95, because I want to find the critical value that cuts off the 
upper 5 percent of the binomial distribution.

331
 Chapter 16: Introducing Probability
 
 With values entered for the arguments, the critical value, 4, appears in 
the dialog box.
 
4. Click OK to put the answer into the selected cell.
As it happens, the critical value is the number of successes in the sample. 
The decision is to reject H0.
More on hypothesis testing
In some situations, the binomial distribution approximates the standard 
normal distribution. When this happens, you use the statistics of the normal 
distribution to answer questions about the binomial distribution. 
Those statistics involve z- scores, which means that you have to know the mean 
and the standard deviation of the binomial. Fortunately, they’re easy to com-
pute. If N is the number of trials, and π is the probability of a success, the mean is
the variance is
and the standard deviation is 
The binomial approximation to the normal is appropriate when N π ≥ 5 and 
N(1- π) ≥ 5. 
When you test a hypothesis, you’re making an inference about π, and you have 
to start with an estimate. You run N trials and get x successes. The estimate is
In order to create a z-score, you need one more piece of information — the 
standard error of P. This sounds harder than it is, because this standard 
error is just
Now you’re ready for a hypothesis test. 

332
Part IV: Working with Probability 
Here’s an example. The CEO of the FarKlempt Robotics Inc. believes that 50 
percent of FarKlempt robots are purchased for home use. A sample of 1,000 
FarKlempt customers indicates that 550 of them use their robots at home. Is 
this significantly different from what the CEO believes? The hypotheses:
H0: π = .50
H1: π ≠ .50
I set α = .05
N π = 500, and N(1- π) = 500, so the normal approximation is appropriate.
First, calculate P:
Now, create a z-score
With α = .05, is 3.162 a large enough z-score to reject H0? An easy way to find 
out is to use the worksheet function NORMSDIST (Chapter 8). If you do, you’ll 
find that this z-score cuts off less than .01 of the area in the upper tail of the 
standard normal distribution. The decision is to reject H0.
The Hypergeometric Distribution
Here’s another distribution that deals with successes and failures. 
I start with an example. In a set of 16 light bulbs, 9 are good and 7 are defective. 
If you randomly select 6 light bulbs out of these 16, what’s the probability 
that 3 of the 6 are good? Consider selecting a good lightbulb as a “success.” 
When you finish selecting, your set of selections is a combination of 3 of the 
9 good light bulbs together with a combination of 3 of the 7 defective light 
bulbs. The probability of getting 3 good bulbs is a . . . well . . . combination of 
counting rules:

333
 Chapter 16: Introducing Probability
Each outcome of the selection of the good light bulbs can associate with all 
outcomes of the selection of the defective light bulbs, so the product rule is 
appropriate for the numerator. The denominator (the sample space) is the 
number of possible combinations of 6 items in a group of 16.
This is an example of the hypergeometric distribution. In general, with a small 
population that consists of N1 successes and N2 failures, the probability of x 
successes in a sample of m items is
The random variable x is said to be a hypergeometrically distributed random 
variable.
HYPERGEOMDIST
This function calculates everything for you when you deal with the hyper-
geometric distribution. Here’s how to use it to go through the example I just 
showed you.
 
1. Select a cell for HYPERGEOMDIST’s answer.
 
2. From the Statistical Functions menu, select HYPERGEOMDIST to open 
its Function Arguments dialog box (Figure 16-8).

for the arguments.
 
 In the Sample_s box, I entered the number of successes in the sample. 
That number is 3 for this example.

Part IV: Working with Probability 
 
 In the Number_sample box, I entered the number of items in the sample. 
The sample size for this example is 6.
 
 In the Population_s box, I entered the number of successes in the popu-
lation. In this example that’s 7, the number of good light bulbs.
 
 In the Number_pop box, I entered the number of items in the population. 
The total number of light bulbs is 16, and that’s the population size.
 
 With values entered for all the arguments, the answer appears in the 
dialog box. The answer is 0.37 and some additional decimal places.
 
4. Click OK to put the answer into the selected cell.
As I do with the binomial, I use HYPERGEOMDIST to calculate pr(0) through 
p(6) for this example. Then I use Excel’s graphics capabilities (see Chapter 3) 
to graph the results. Figure 16-9 shows the data and the graph. My objective 
is to help you visualize and understand the hypergeometric distribution.

I
n the Chapter 16, I delve into probability in a semiformal way, and intro-
duce distributions of random variables. The binomial distribution is the 
starting point. In this chapter, I examine additional distributions.
One of the symbols on the pages of this book (and other books in the 
Dummies series) lets you know that “Technical Stuff” follows. It might have 
been a good idea to hang that symbol above this chapter’s title. So here’s a 
small note of caution: Some mathematics follows. I put the math in to help 
you understand what you’re doing when you work with the dialog boxes of 
the Excel functions I describe. 
Are these functions on the esoteric side? Well . . . yes. Will you ever have 
occasion to use them? Well . . . you just might.
Beta
This one connects with the binomial distribution, which I discuss in Chapter 
16. The beta distribution (not to be confused with “beta,” the probability of a 
Type 2 error) is a sort of chameleon in the world of distributions. It takes on 
a wide variety of appearances, depending on the circumstances. I won’t give 
you all the mathematics behind the beta distribution, because the full treat-
ment involves calculus. 
The connection with the binomial is this: In the binomial, the random variable 
x is the number of successes in N trials with p as the probability of a success. 
N and p are constants. In the beta distribution, the random variable x is the 
probability of a success, with N and the number of successes as constants. 

336
Part IV: Working with Probability 
Why is this useful? In the real world, you usually don’t know the value of p, 
and you’re trying to find it. Typically, you conduct a study, find the number 
of successes in a set of trials, and then you have to estimate p. Beta shows 
you the likelihood of possible values of p for the number of trials and suc-
cesses in your study.
Some of the math is complicated, but I can at least show you the rule that 
generates the density function for N trials with r successes, when N and r are 
whole numbers:
The vertical bar in the parentheses on the left means “given that.” So this 
density function is for specific values of N and r. Calculus enters the picture 
when N and r aren’t whole numbers. (Density function? “Given that”? See 
Chapter 16.)
To give you an idea of what this function looks like, I used Excel to generate 
and graph the density function for four successes in ten trials. Figure 17-1 
shows the data and the graph. Each value on the x-axis is a possible value for 
the probability of a success. The curve shows probability density. As I point 
out in the last chapter, probability density is what makes the area under the 
curve correspond to probability. The curve’s maximum point is at x = .4, 
which is what you would expect for four successes in ten trials.
 
Figure 17-1: 
The Beta 
Density 
function for 
four suc-
cesses in 
ten trials.
 
Suppose I toss a die (one of a pair of dice), and I define a success as any toss 
that results in a 3. I assume I’m tossing a fair die, so I assume that p = pr(3) = 
1/6. Suppose I toss a die ten times and get four 3s. How good does that fair-
die assumption look? 
The graph in Figure 17-1 gives you a hint: The area to the left of .16667 (the 
decimal equivalent of 1/6) is a pretty small proportion of the total area, mean-
ing that the probability that p is 1/6 or less is pretty low. 

337
 Chapter 17: More on Probability
Now, if you have to go through all the trouble of creating a graph, and then 
guesstimate proportions of area to come with an answer like “pretty low,” 
you’re doing a whole lot of work for very little return. Fortunately, Excel has a 
better way.
BETADIST
BETADIST eliminates the need for all the graphing and guesstimating. This 
function enables you to work with the cumulative beta distribution to deter-
mine the probability that p is less than or equal to some value. Considering 
the complexity of beta, BETADIST is surprisingly easy to work with. 
 
In the BETADIST Function Arguments dialog box, and in the BETADIST help file, 
you’ll see “Alpha” and “Beta.” The dialog box tells you each one is a “param-
eter for the distribution” and the help file tells you that each is “a parameter 
of the distribution.” Aside from altering the preposition, neither one is much 
help — at least, not in any way that helps you apply Alpha and Beta. 
So here are the nuts and bolts: For the example I’m working through, Alpha is 
the number of successes and Beta is the number of failures.
When you put the density function in terms of Alpha (α) and Beta (β), it’s
Again, this only applies when α and β are both whole numbers. If that’s not 
the case, you need calculus to compute f(x).
The steps are:
 
1. Select a cell for BETADIST’s answer.
 
2. From the Statistical Functions menu, select BETADIST to open its 
Function Arguments dialog box (Figure 17-2).
 
3. In the Function Arguments dialog box, type the appropriate values for 
the arguments.
 
 The X box holds the probability of a success. For this example, the prob-
ability of a success is 1/6.
 
 Excel refers to Alpha and Beta (coming up next) as “parameters to the 
distribution.” I treat them as “number of successes” and “number of fail-
ures.” So I entered 4 in the Alpha box and 6 in the Beta box.
 
 The A box and the B box are evaluation limits for the value in the X box. 
These aren’t relevant for this type of example. I left them blank, which 
by default sets A = 0 and B=1.

four successes in ten tosses, you’d intuitively expect that p is greater 
than 1/6.
 
4. Click OK to put the answer into the selected cell.
The beta distribution has wider applicability than I show you here. 
Consequently, you can put all kinds of numbers (within certain restrictions) 
into the various boxes. For example, the value you put into the X box can be 
greater than 1.00, and you can enter values that aren’t whole numbers into 
the Alpha box and the Beta box.
BETAINV
This one is the inverse of BETADIST. If you enter a probability and values for 
successes and failures, it returns a value for p. For example if you supply it 
with .048021492, 4 successes, and 6 failures, it returns 0.1666667 — the deci-
mal equivalent of 1/6. 
 
BETAINV has a more helpful application. You can use it to find the confidence 
limits for the probability of a success. 
Suppose you’ve found r successes in N trials, and you’re interested in the 
95 percent confidence limits for the probability of a success. The lower 
limit is:

 Chapter 17: More on Probability
The upper limit is:
 
1. Select a cell for BETAINV’s answer.
 
2. From the Statistical Functions menu, select BETAINV to open its 
Function Arguments dialog box (Figure 17-3).

3. In the Function Arguments dialog box, enter the appropriate values 
for the arguments. 
 
 The X box holds a cumulative probability. For the lower bound of the 95 
percent confidence limits, the probability is .025. 
 
 In the Alpha box, I entered the number of successes. For this example 
that’s 4. 
 
 In the Beta box, I entered the number of failures (NOT the number of 
trials). The number of failures is 6.
 
 The A box and the B box are evaluation limits for the value in the X box. 
Again, these aren’t relevant for this type of example. I left them blank, 
which by default sets A = 0 and B=1. 
 
 With the entries for X, Alpha, and Beta, the answer appears in the dialog 
box. The answer for this example is .13699536.
 
4. Click OK to put the answer into the selected cell.
Entering .975 in the X box gives .700704575 as the result. So the 95 percent 
confidence limits for the probability of a success are .137 and .701 (rounded 
off) if you have 4 successes in 10 trials. 

340
Part IV: Working with Probability 
With more trials of course, the confidence limit narrows. For 40 successes in 
100 trials, the confidence limits are .307 and .497
Poisson
If you have the kind of process that produces a binomial distribution, and 
you have an extremely large number of trials and a very small number of suc-
cesses, the Poisson distribution approximates the binomial. The equation of 
the Poisson is
In the numerator, μ is the mean number of successes in the trials, and e is 
2.71828 (and infinitely more decimal places), a constant near and dear to the 
hearts of mathematicians. 
Here’s an example. The FarKlempt Robotics Inc. produces a universal joint 
for its robots’ elbows. The production process is under strict computer con-
trol, so that the probability a joint is defective is .001. What is the probability 
that in a sample of 1000, one joint is defective? What’s the probability that 
two are defective? Three?
Named after 19th-century mathematician Siméon-Denis Poisson, this distribu-
tion is computationally easier than the binomial — or at least it was when 
mathematicians had no computational aids. With Excel, you can easily use 
BINOMDIST to do the binomial calculations.
First, I apply the Poisson distribution to the FarKlempt example. If π = .001 
and N = 1000, the mean is
 (See Chapter 16 for an explanation of μ = N π .)
Now for the Poisson. The probability that one joint in a sample of 1000 is 
defective is:

341
 Chapter 17: More on Probability
For two defective joints in 1000, it’s
And for three defective joints in 1000:
 
As you read through this, it may seem odd that I refer to a defective item as a 
“success.” Remember, that’s just a way of labeling a specific event.
POISSON
Here are the steps for using Excel’s POISSON for the preceding example:
 
1. Select a cell for POISSON’s answer.
 
2. From the Statistical Functions menu, select POISSON to open its 
Function Arguments dialog box (Figure 17-4).
 
Figure 17-4:

3. In the Function Arguments dialog box, enter the appropriate values 
for the arguments. 
 
 In the X box, I entered the number of events for which I’m determining 
the probability. I’m looking for pr(1), so I entered 1.
.  
 In the Mean box, I entered the mean of the process. That’s N π, which for 
this example is 1.

342
Part IV: Working with Probability 
 
 In the Cumulative box, it’s either TRUE for the cumulative probability or 
FALSE for just the probability of the number of events. I entered FALSE.
. 
 With the entries for X, Mean, and Cumulative, the answer appears in the 
dialog box. The answer for this example is .367879441.
 
4. Click OK to put the answer into the selected cell.
In the example, I showed you the probability for two defective joints in 1,000 
and the probability for three. To follow through with the calculations, I’d 
type 2 into the X box to calculate pr(2), and 3 to find pr(3).
As I said before, in the 21st century, it’s pretty easy to calculate the binomial 
probabilities directly. Figure 17-5 shows you the Poisson and the Binomial 
probabilities for the numbers in Column B and the conditions of the example. 
I graphed the probabilities so you can see how close the two really are. I 
selected Cell D3 so the formula box shows you how I used BINOMDIST to cal-
culate the binomial probabilities.

Although the Poisson’s usefulness as an approximation is outdated, it has 
taken on a life of its own. Phenomena as widely disparate as reaction time 
data in psychology experiments, degeneration of radioactive substances, and 
scores in professional hockey games seem to fit Poisson distributions. This is 
why business analysts and scientific researchers like to base models on this 
distribution. (“Base models on?” What does that mean? I tell you all about it 
in Chapter 18.) 
Gamma
The gamma distribution is related to the Poisson distribution in the same way 
the negative binomial distribution is related to the binomial. The negative 

343
 Chapter 17: More on Probability
binomial tells you the number of trials until a specified number of successes 
in a binomial distribution. The gamma distribution tells you how many sam-
ples you go through to find a specified number of successes in a Poisson dis-
tribution. Each sample can be a set of objects (as in the FarKlempt Robotics 
universal joint example), a physical area, or a time interval.
The probability density function for the gamma distribution is:
Again, this works when α is a whole number. If it’s not, you guessed it — 
calculus. (By the way, when this function has only whole-number values of 
α it’s called the Erlang distribution, just in case anybody ever asks you.) The 
letter e, once again, is the constant 2.7818 I told you about earlier.
Don’t worry about the exotic-looking math. As long as you understand what 
each symbol means, you’re in business. Excel does the heavy lifting for you. 
So here’s what the symbols mean. For the FarKlempt Robotics example, α is 
the number of successes and β corresponds to μ the Poisson distribution. 
The variable x tracks the number of samples. So if x is 3, α is 2, and β is 1, 
you’re talking about the probability density associated with finding the second 
success in the third sample, if the average number of successes per sample 
(of 1000) is 1. (Where does 1 come from, again? That’s 1000 universal joints 
per sample multiplied by .001, the probability of producing a defective one.)
To determine probability, you have to work with area under the density func-
tion. This brings me to the Excel worksheet function designed for gamma.
GAMMADIST
GAMMADIST gives you a couple of options. You can use it to calculate the 
probability density, and you can use it to calculate probability. Figure 17-6 
shows how I used the first option to create a graph of the probability density 
so you can see what the function looks like. Working within the context of the 
example I just laid out, I set Alpha to 2, Beta to 1, and calculated the density 
for the values of x in Column D.
The values in Column E shows the probability densities associated with find-
ing the second defective universal joint in the indicated number of samples 
of 1000. For example, Cell E5 holds the probability density for finding the 
second defective joint in the third sample.

In real life, you work with probabilities rather than densities. Next, I show 
you how to use GAMMADIST to determine the probability of finding the 
second defective joint in the third sample. Here it is:

for the arguments. 
 
 The X box holds the number of samples for which I’m determining the 
probability. I’m looking for pr(3), so I entered 3.
 
 In the Alpha box, I entered the number of successes. I want to find the 
second success in the third sample, so I entered 2.
  
 In the Beta box, I entered the average number of successes that occur 
within a sample. For this example, that’s 1. 
 
 In the Cumulative box the choices are TRUE for the cumulative distribu-
tion or FALSE to find the probability density. I want to find the probabil-
ity, not the density, so I entered TRUE.

 With values entered for X, Alpha, Beta, and Cumulative, the answer — 
.800851727 — appears in the dialog box.
 
4. Click OK to put the answer into the selected cell.
GAMMAINV
If you want to know, at a certain level of probability, how many samples it 
takes to observe a specified number of successes, this is the function for you.
GAMMAINV is the inverse of GAMMADIST. Enter a probability along with 
Alpha and Beta and it returns the number of samples. Its Function Arguments 
dialog box has a Probability box, an Alpha box, and a Beta box. Figure 
17-8 shows that if you enter the answer for the preceding section into the 
Probability box and the same numbers for Alpha and Beta, the answer is 3. 
(Well, actually, a tiny bit more than 3.)

Exponential
If you’re dealing with the gamma distribution and you have Alpha = 1, you 
have the exponential distribution. This gives the probability that it takes a 
specified number of samples to get to the first success.
What does the density function look like? Excuse me . . . I’m about to go mathemat-
ical on you for a moment. Here, once again, is the density function for gamma:
If α = 1, it looks like this:

Statisticians like substituting λ (the Greek letter “lambda”) for , so here’s 
the final version:
I bring this up because Excel’s EXPONDIST Function Arguments dialog box 
has a box for LAMBDA, and I want you to know what it means.
EXPONDIST
Use EXPONDIST to determine the probability that it takes a specified number 
of samples to get to the first success in a Poisson distribution. Here, I work 
once again with the universal joint example. I show you how to find the prob-
ability that you’ll see the first success in the third sample.

 In the X box, I entered the number of samples for which I’m determining 
the probability. I’m looking for pr(3), so I typed 3.
 
 In the Lambda box, I entered the average number of successes per 
sample. This goes back to the numbers I gave you in the example — the 
probability of a success (.001) times the number of universal joints in 
each sample (1000). That product is 1, so I entered 1 in this box.

 In the Cumulative box, the choices are TRUE for the cumulative distribu-
tion or FALSE to find the probability density. I want to find the probabil-
ity, not the density, so I entered TRUE.

A Career in Modeling
In This Chapter
▶ What is a model?
▶ Modeling and fitting
▶ Working with the Monte Carlo method
M
odel is a term that gets thrown around a lot these days. Simply put, 
a model is something you know and can work with that helps you 
understand something you know little about. A model is supposed to mimic, 
in some way, the thing it’s modeling. A globe, for example, is a model of the 
earth. A street map is a model of a neighborhood. A blueprint is a model of 
a house.
Researchers use models to help them understand natural processes and 
phenomena. Business analysts use models to help them understand business 
processes. The models these people use might include concepts from math-
ematics and statistics — concepts that are so well known they can shed light 
on the unknown. The idea is to create a model that consists of concepts you 
understand, put the model through its paces, and see if the results look like 
real-world results.
In this chapter, I discuss modeling. My goal is to show how you can harness 
Excel’s statistical capabilities to help you understand processes in your world.
Modeling a Distribution
In one approach to modeling, you gather data and group them into a distri-
bution. Next, you try and figure out a process that results in that kind of a 
distribution. Restate that process in statistical terms so that it can generate a 
distribution, and then see how well the generated distribution matches up to 
the real one. This “process you figure out and restate in statistical terms” is 
the model. 

350
Part IV: Working with Probability 
If the distribution you generate matches up well with the real data, does this 
mean your model is “right”? Does it mean the process you guessed is the pro-
cess that produces the data? 
Unfortunately, no. The logic doesn’t work that way. You can show that a 
model is wrong, but you can’t prove that it’s right. 
Plunging into the Poisson distribution
In this section, I go through an example of modeling with the Poisson distri-
bution. I introduced this distribution in Chapter 17, and I told you it seems to 
characterize an array of processes in the real world. By characterize a pro-
cess, I mean that a distribution of real-world data looks a lot like a Poisson 
distribution. When this happens, it’s possible that the kind of process that 
produces a Poisson distribution is also responsible for producing the data.
What is that process? Start with a random variable x that tracks the number 
of occurrences of a specific event in an interval. In Chapter 17, the “interval” 
was a sample of 1,000 universal joints, and the specific event was “defective 
joint.” Poisson distributions are also appropriate for events occurring in 
intervals of time, and the event can be something like “arrival at a toll booth.” 
Next, I outline the conditions for a Poisson process, and use both defective 
joints and toll booth arrivals to illustrate:
 
✓ The numbers of occurrences of the event in two nonoverlapping inter-
vals are independent.
 
 The number of defective joints in one sample is independent of the number 
of defective joints in another. The number of arrivals at a toll booth during 
one hour is independent of the number of arrivals during another.
 
✓ The probability of an occurrence of the event is proportional to the size 
of the interval.
 
 The chance that you’ll find a defective joint is larger in a sample of 
10,000 than it is in a sample of 1,000. The chance of an arrival at a toll 
booth is greater for one hour than it is for a half hour.
 
✓ The probability of more than one occurrence of the event in a small 
interval is 0 or close to 0.
 
 In a sample of 1,000 universal joints, you have an extremely low prob-
ability of finding two defective ones right next to one another. At any 
time, two vehicles don’t arrive at a toll booth simultaneously.
As I show you in Chapter 17, the formula for the Poisson distribution is

351
 Chapter 18: A Career in Modeling
In this equation, μ represents the average number of occurrences of the 
event in the interval you’re looking at, and e is the constant 2.781828 (fol-
lowed by infinitely many more decimal places). 
Time to use the Poisson in a model. At the FarBlonJet Corporation, web design-
ers track the number of hits per hour on the intranet home page. They moni-
tor the page for 200 consecutive hours, and group the data as in Table 18-1.

The first column shows the variable Hits/Hour. The second column, Observed 
Hours, shows the number of hours in which each value of Hits/Hour occurred. 
In the 200 hours observed, 10 of those hours went by with no hits, 30 hours 
had one hit, 44 had two hits, and so on. These data lead the web designers 
to use a Poisson distribution to model Hits/Hour. Another way to say this: 
They believe a Poisson process produces the number of hits per hour on the 
Web page.
Multiplying the first column by the second column results in the third 
column. Summing the third column shows that in the 200 observed hours the 
intranet page received 600 hits. So the average number of hits/hour is 3.00.
Applying the Poisson distribution to this example,
From here on, I pick it up in Excel.

352
Part IV: Working with Probability 
Using POISSON 
Figure 18-1 shows each value of x (hits/hour), the probability of each x if the 
average number of hits per hour is 3, the predicted number of hours, and the 
observed number of hours (taken from the second column in Table 18-1). I 
selected cell B3 so that the formula box shows how I used the POISSON work-
sheet function. I autofilled Column B down to cell B10. (For the details on 
using POISSON, see Chapter 17.)
 
Figure 18-1:

hits/hour — 
Poisson-
predicted 
(μ=3) and 
observed.
 
To get the predicted number of hours, I multiplied each probability in 
Column B by 200 (the total number of observed hours). I used Excel’s graph-
ics capabilities (see Chapter 3) to show you how close the predicted hours 
are to the observed hours. They look pretty close, don’t they?
Testing the model’s fit
Well, “looking pretty close” isn’t enough for a statistician. A statistical test is 
a necessity. As is the case with all statistical tests, this one starts with a null 
hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis. Here they are:
H0: The distribution of observed hits/hour follows a Poisson distribution.
H1: Not H0
The appropriate statistical test involves an extension of the binomial distri-
bution. It’s called the multinomial distribution — “multi” because it encom-
passes more categories than just “success” and “failure.” It’s difficult to work 
with, and Excel has no worksheet function to handle the computations.
Fortunately, pioneering statistician Karl Pearson (inventor of the correla-
tion coefficient) noticed that χ2 (“chi-square”), a distribution I show you in 

353
 Chapter 18: A Career in Modeling
Chapter 11, approximates the multinomial. Originally intended for one-sample 
hypothesis tests about variances, χ2 has become much better known for 
applications like the one I’m about to show you.
Pearson’s big idea was this. If you want to know how well a hypothesized 
distribution (like the Poisson) fits a sample (like the observed hours), use 
the distribution to generate a hypothesized sample (our predicted hours, for 
instance), and work with this formula:
Usually, this is written with Expected rather than Predicted, and both 
Observed and Expected are abbreviated. The usual form of this formula is:
For this example
What does that total up to? Excel figures it out for us. Figure 18-2 shows the 
same columns as before, with column F holding the values for (O-E)2/E. I 
could have used this formula
=((D3-C3)^2)/C3
to calculate the value in F3 and then autofill up to F10.
I chose a different route. First I assigned the name Predicted_Hrs to C3:C10 
and the name Observed_Hrs to D3:D10. Then I used an array formula (see 
Chapter 2). I selected F3:F10 and created this formula
=(Observed_Hrs-Predicted_Hrs)^2/Predicted_Hrs
Pressing CTRL+Shift+Enter puts the values into F3:F10. That key combination 
also puts the curly brackets into the formula in the Formula Bar.
The sum of the values in column F is in cell F11, and that’s χ2. If you’re trying 
to show that the Poisson distribution is a good fit to the data, you’re looking 
for a low value of χ2.

compute χ2.
 
OK. Now what? Is 3.5661 high or is it low?
To find out, you evaluate the calculated value of χ2 against the χ2 distribution. 
The goal is to find the probability of getting a value at least as high as the cal-
culated value, 3.5661. The trick is to know how many degrees of freedom (df) 
you have. For a goodness-of-fit application like this one
where k = the number of categories and m = the number of parameters esti-
mated from the data. The number of categories is 8 (0 Hits/Hour through 7 
Hits/Hour). The number of parameters? I used the observed hours to esti-
mate the parameter μ, so m in this example is 1. That means df = 8-1-1= 6. 
Use the worksheet function CHIDIST on the value in F11, with 6 df. CHIDIST 
returns .73515, the probability of getting a χ2 of at least 3.5661 if H0 is true. 
(See Chapter 10 for more on CHIDIST.) Figure 18-3 shows the χ2 distribution 
with 6 df and the area to the right of 3.5661.
If α = .05, the decision is to not reject H0 — meaning you can’t reject the 
hypothesis that the observed data come from a Poisson distribution. 
This is one of those infrequent times when it’s beneficial to not reject H0 — 
if you want to make the case that a Poisson process is producing the data. If 
the probability had been just a little greater than .05, not rejecting H0 would 
look suspicious. The large probability, however, makes nonrejection of H0 — 
and an underlying Poisson process — seem more reasonable. (For more on 
this see the sidebar in Chapter 10.)

A word about CHITEST
Excel provides CHITEST, a worksheet function that on first look appears 
to carry out the test I showed you with about one tenth the work I did on 
the worksheet. Its Function Arguments dialog box provides one box for the 
observed values and another for the expected values. 
The problem is that CHITEST does not return a value for χ2. It skips that step 
and returns the probability that you’ll get a χ2 at least as high as the one you 
calculate from the observed values and the predicted values. 
The problem is that CHITEST’s degrees of freedom are wrong for this case. 
CHITEST goes ahead and assumes that df = k-1 (7) rather than k-m-1 (6). You 
lose a degree of freedom because you estimate μ from the data. In other 
kinds of modeling, you lose more than one degree of freedom. Suppose, for 
example, you believe that a normal distribution characterizes the underlying 
process. In that case, you estimate μ and σ from the data, and you lose two 
degrees of freedom.
By basing its answer on less than the correct df, CHITEST gives you an inap-
propriately large (and misleading) value for the probability. 

356
Part IV: Working with Probability 
CHITEST would be perfect if it had an option for entering df, or if it returned a 
value for χ2 (which you could then evaluate via CHIDIST and the correct df). 
When you don’t lose any degrees of freedom, CHITEST works as advertised. 
Does that ever happen? In the next section, it does.
Playing ball with a model
Baseball is a game that generates huge amounts of statistics — and many 
study these statistics closely. SABR, the Society for American Baseball 
Research, has sprung from the efforts of a band of dedicated fan-statisticians 
(fantasticians?) who delve into the statistical nooks and crannies of the Great 
American Pastime. They call their work sabermetrics. (I made up “fantasti-
cians.” They call themselves “sabermetricians.”)
The reason I mention this is that sabermetrics supplies a nice example of 
modeling. It’s based on the obvious idea that during a game a baseball team’s 
objective is to score runs, and to keep its opponent from scoring runs. The 
better a team does at both, the more games it wins. Bill James, who gave 
sabermetrics its name and is its leading exponent, discovered a neat relation-
ship between the amount of runs a team scores, the amount of runs the team 
allows, and its winning percentage. He calls it the Pythagorean percentage:
Think of it as a model for predicting games won. Calculate this percentage 
and multiply it by the number of games a team plays. Then compare the 
answer to the team’s wins. How well does the model predict the number of 
games each team won during the 2008 season? 
To find out, I found all the relevant data for every Major League team for 
2008. (Thank you, www.baseball-reference.com.) I put the data into the 
worksheet in Figure 18-4.
As Figure 18-4 shows, I used an array formula to calculate the Pythagorean 
percentage in Column D. First, I assigned the name Runs_Scored to the data 
in Column B, and the name Runs_Allowed to the data in Column C. Then I 
selected D2:D31 and created the formula
=Runs_Scored^2/(Runs_Scored^2 + Runs_Allowed^2)
Next, I pressed CTRL+Shift+Enter to put the values into D2:D31 and the curly 
brackets into the formula in the Formula Bar.

Had I wanted to do it another way, I’d have put this formula in Cell D2:
=B2^2/((B2^2)+(C2^2))
Then I would have autofilled the remaining cells in Column D. 
Finally, I multiplied each Pythagorean percentage in Column D by the number 
of games each team played (24 teams played 162 games, 6 played 161) to get 
the predicted wins in Column E. Because the number of wins can only be a 
whole number, I used the ROUND function to round off the predicted wins. 
For example, the formula that supplies the value in E3 is:
=ROUND(D3*162,0)
The zero in the parentheses indicates that I wanted no decimal places.
Before proceeding, I assigned the name Predicted_Wins to the data in 
Column E, and the name Wins to the data in Column F.

Part IV: Working with Probability 
How well does the model fit with reality? This time, CHITEST can supply the 
answer. I don’t lose any degrees of freedom here: I didn’t use the Wins data 
in Column F to estimate any parameters, like a mean or a variance, and then 
apply those parameters to calculate Predicted Wins. Instead, the predictions 
came from other data — the Runs Scored and the Runs Allowed. For this 
reason, df = k-m-1= 30-0-1 = 29.
Here’s how to use CHITEST (when it’s appropriate!):
 
1. With the data entered, select a cell for CHITEST’s answer.
 
2. From the Statistical Functions menu, select CHITEST and click OK to 
open the Function Arguments dialog box for CHITEST. (See Figure 18-5.)
 
Figure 18-5: 
The 
CHITEST 
Function 
Arguments 
dialog box.
 
 
3. In the Function Arguments dialog box, type the appropriate values for 
the arguments. 
 
 In the Actual_range box, type the cell range that holds the scores for the 
observed values. For this example, that’s Wins (the name for F2:F32).
 
 In the Expected_range box, type the cell range that holds the predicted 
values. For this example, it’s Predicted_Wins (the name for E2:E32).
 
 With the cursor in the Expected_range box, the dialog box mentions a 
product of row totals and column totals. Don’t let that confuse you. That 
has to do with a slightly different application of this function (which I 
cover in Chapter 20).
 
 With values entered for Actual_range and for Expected_range, the 
answer appears in the dialog box. The answer here is .99999518, which 
means that with 29 degrees of freedom you have a huge chance of find-
ing a value of χ2 at least as high as the one you’d calculate from these 
observed values and these predicted values. Bottom line: The model fits 
the data extremely well.
 
4. Click OK to put the answer into the selected cell.

A Simulating Discussion
Another approach to modeling is to simulate a process. The idea is to define 
as much as you can about what a process does and then somehow use num-
bers to represent that process and carry it out. It’s a great way to find out 
what a process does in case other methods of analysis are very complex. 
Taking a chance: The Monte Carlo method
Many processes contain an element of randomness. You just can’t predict 
the outcome with certainty. To simulate this type of process, you have to 
have some way of simulating the randomness. Simulation methods that incor-
porate randomness are called Monte Carlo simulations. The name comes 
from the city in Monaco whose main attraction is gambling casinos. 
In the next sections, I show you a couple of examples. These examples aren’t 
so complex that you can’t analyze them. I use them for just that reason: You 
can check the results against analysis.
Loading the dice
In Chapter 16, I talked about a die (one member of a pair of dice) that’s 
biased to come up according to the numbers on its faces: A 6 is six times as 
likely as a 1, a 5 is five times as likely, and so on. On any toss, the probability 
of getting a number n is n/21.
Suppose you have a pair of dice loaded this way. What would the outcomes 
of 200 tosses of these dice look like? What would be the average of those 200 
tosses? What would be the variance and the standard deviation? You can use 
Excel to set up Monte Carlo simulations and answer these questions.
To start, I used Excel to calculate the probability of each outcome. Figure 
18-6 shows how I did it. Column A holds all the possible outcomes of tossing 
a pair of dice (2-12). Columns C through N hold the possible ways of getting 
each outcome. Columns C, E, G, I, K, and M show the possible outcomes on 
the first die. Columns D, F, H, J, L, and N show the possible outcomes on the 
second die. Column B gives the probability of each outcome, based on the 
numbers in Columns C-M. I highlighted B7 so the formula box shows I used 
this formula to have Excel calculate the probability of a 7:
=((C7*D7)+(E7*F7)+(G7*H7)+(I7*J7)+(K7*L7)+(M7*N7))/21^2
I autofilled the remaining cells in Column B.

360
Part IV: Working with Probability 
The sum in B14 confirms that I considered every possibility.
 
Figure 18-6: 
Outcomes 
and prob-
abilities for 
a pair of 
loaded dice.
 
Next, it’s time to simulate the process of tossing the dice. Each toss, in effect, 
generates a value of the random variable x according to the probability distri-
bution defined by Column A and Column B. How do you simulate these tosses?
Data analysis tool: Random Number Generation
Excel’s Random Number Generation tool is tailor-made for this kind of simu-
lation. Tell it how many values you want to generate, give it a probability 
distribution to work with, and it randomly generates numbers according to 
the parameters of the distribution. Each randomly generated number corre-
sponds to a toss of the dice. 
Here’s how to use the Random Number Generation Tool:
 
1. Select Data | Data Analysis to open the Data Analysis dialog box.
 
2. In the Data Analysis dialog box, scroll down the Analysis Tools list 
and select Random Number Generation. Click OK to open the Random 
Number Generation dialog box.
 
 Figure 18-7 shows the Random Number Generation dialog box.

 Chapter 18: A Career in Modeling
 
3. In the Number of Variables box, type the number of variables you 
want to create random numbers for.
 
 I know, I know. . . Don’t end a sentence with a preposition. As Winston 
Churchill once said: “That’s the kind of nonsense up with which I will 
not put.” Hey but seriously, I entered 1 for this example. I’m only inter-
ested in the outcomes of tossing a pair of dice. 
 
4. In the Number of Random Numbers box, type the number of numbers 
to generate.
 
 I entered 200 to simulate 200 tosses of the loaded dice.
 
5. In the Distribution box, click the down arrow to select the type of 
distribution.
 
 You have seven options here. The choice you make determines what 
appears in the Parameters area of the dialog box, because different 
types of distributions have different types (and numbers) of parameters. 
You’re dealing with a discrete random variable here, so the appropriate 
choice is Discrete.
 
6. Choosing Discrete causes the Value and Probability Input Range box 
to appear under Parameters. Enter the array of cells that holds the 
values of the variable and the associated probabilities.
 
 The possible outcomes of the tosses of the die are in A2:A12, and the 
probabilities are in B2:B12, so the range is A2:B12. Excel fills in the 
$-signs for absolute referencing.
 
7. In the Output Options, select a radio button to indicate where you 
want the results.
 
 I selected New Worksheet Ply to put the results on a new page in the 
worksheet.
 
8. Click OK.
Because I selected New Worksheet Ply, a newly created page opens with the 
results. Figure 18-8 shows the new page. The randomly generated numbers 
are in Column A. The 200 rows of random numbers are too long to show you. 
I could have cut and pasted them into 10 columns of 20 cells, but then you’d 
just be looking at 200 random numbers. 
Instead, I used FREQUENCY to group the numbers into frequencies in 
Columns C and D and then used Excel’s graphics capabilities to create a 
graph of the results. I selected D2 so the formula box shows how I used 
FREQUENCY for that cell. As you can see, I defined Tosses as the name for 
A2:A201 and x as the name for C2:C12.

362

Figure 18-8: 
The results

ing 200 
tosses of

What about the statistics for these simulated tosses? 
=AVERAGE(Tosses) 
tells you the mean is 8.240. 
=VAR(Tosses) 
returns 4.244 as the estimate of the variance, and SQRT applied to the vari-
ance returns 2.060 as the estimate of the standard deviation. 
How do these values match up with the parameters of the random variable? 
This is what I meant before by “checking against analysis.” In Chapter 16, I 
show how to calculate the expected value (the mean), the variance, and the 
standard deviation for a discrete random variable. 
The expected value is:
In the worksheet in Figure 18-6, I used the SUMPRODUCT worksheet function 
to calculate E(x). The formula is:
=SUMPRODUCT(A2:A12,B2:B12)
The expected value is 8.667. 
The variance is:

363
 Chapter 18: A Career in Modeling
With E(x) stored in B16, I used this formula
=SUMPRODUCT(A2:A12,A2:A12,B2:B12)-B16^2
 
Note the use of A2:A12 twice in SUMPRODUCT. That gives you the sum of x2.
The formula returns 4.444 as the variance. SQRT applied to that number gives 
2.108 as the standard deviation. 
Table 18-2 shows how closely the results from the simulation match up with 
the parameters of the random variable.

Simulating the Central Limit Theorem
This might surprise you, but statisticians often use simulations to make 
determinations about some of their statistics. They do this when mathemati-
cal analysis becomes very difficult. 
For example, some statistical tests depend on normally distributed popula-
tions. If the populations aren’t normal, what happens to those tests? Do they 
still do what they’re supposed to? To answer that question, statisticians might 
create non-normally distributed populations of numbers, simulate experiments 
with them, and apply the statistical tests to the simulated results.
In this section, I use simulation to examine an important statistical item — 
the Central Limit Theorem. In Chapter 9, I introduce the Central Limit 
Theorem in connection with the sampling distribution of the mean. In fact, 
I simulated sampling from a population with only three possible values to 
show you that even with a small sample size, the sampling distribution starts 
to look normally distributed.
Here, I use the Random Number Generation tool to set up a normally distrib-
uted population and draw 40 samples of 16 scores each. I calculate the mean 

364
Part IV: Working with Probability 
of each sample, and then set up a distribution of those means. The idea is to 
see how that distribution matches up with the Central Limit Theorem.
The distribution for this example has the parameters of the population of 
scores on the IQ test, a distribution I use for examples in several chapters. 
It’s a normal distribution with μ=100 and σ=16. According to the Central Limit 
Theorem, the mean of the distribution of means should be 100, and the stan-
dard deviation (the standard error of the mean) should be 4.
For a normal distribution, the Random Number Generation dialog box looks 
like Figure 18-9. The first two entries cause Excel to generate 16 random num-
bers for a single variable. Choosing Normal in the Distribution box causes 
the Mean box and the Standard Deviation box to appear under Parameters. 
As the Figure shows, I entered 100 for the Mean and 16 for the Standard 
Deviation. Under Output Options, I selected Output Range and entered a 
column of 16 cells. This puts the randomly generated numbers into the indi-
cated column on the current page. 
 
Figure 18-9: 
The Random 
Number 
Generation 
dialog box 
for a normal 
distribution.
 
I used this dialog box 40 times to generate 40 simulated samples of 16 scores 
each from a normal population, and put the results in adjoining columns. 
Then I used AVERAGE to calculate the mean for each column. 
Next, I copied the 40 means to another worksheet so I could show you how 
they’re distributed. I calculated their mean and the standard deviation. I used 
FREQUENCY to group the means into a frequency distribution, and Excel’s 
graphics capabilities to graph the distribution. Figure 18-10 shows the results.
The mean of the means, 99.671, is close to the Central Limit Theorem’s pre-
dicted value of 100. The standard deviation of the means, 3.885, is close to 
the Central Limit’s predicted value of 4 for the standard error of the mean. 
The graph shows the makings of a normal distribution, although it’s slightly 
skewed. In general, the simulation matches up well with the Central Limit 
Theorem.

A couple of paragraphs ago, I said “I copied the 40 means to another work-
sheet.” That’s not quite a slam-dunk. When you try to paste a cell into another 
worksheet, and that cell holds a formula, Excel usually balks and gives you an 
ugly-looking error message when you paste. That happens when the formula 
refers to cell locations that don’t hold any values in the new worksheet.
To get around that, you have to do a little trick on the cell you want to copy. 
You have to convert its contents from a formula into the value that the for-
mula calculates. The steps are:
 
1. Select the cell or cell array you want to copy.
 
2. Right-click and from the pop-up menu, select Copy (or just press 
Ctrl+C without right-clicking).
 
3. Click the cell where you want the copy to go.
 
4. Right-click and from the pop-up menu again, select Paste Special to 
open the Paste Special dialog box. (See Figure 18-11.)
 
5. In the dialog box, select the Values radio button.
 
6. Click OK to complete the conversion.
 
The Paste Special dialog box offers another helpful capability. Every so often 
in statistical work, you have to take a row of values and relocate them into a 
column or vice versa. Excel calls this transposition. In the steps that follow, I 
describe transposing a row into a column, but it works the other way, too:
 
1. Select a row of data.
 
2. Right-click and from the pop-up menu, select copy or press Ctrl+ C 
without right-clicking.

5. Click the Transpose checkbox. (It’s in the lower-right corner.)
 
6. Click OK to complete the row-to-column transposition.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
W
e come to the famous “Part of Tens.” I put two 
chapters into this part. The first one covers statis-
tical traps and helpful tips — from problems with hypoth-
esis testing to advice on graphs, from pitfalls in regression 
to advice on graphing variability. 
The second chapter goes over a number of Excel features 
I just couldn’t fit anywhere else. This part covers forcast-
ing, graphing, testing for independence, and more. I talk 
about Excel functions based on logarithms – do you see 
what I mean about not fitting anywhere else? – and end by 
showing you how to import data from the Web.

Chapter 19
Ten Statistical and Graphical 
Tips and Traps
In This Chapter
▶ Beware of significance
▶ Be wary of graphs
▶ Be cautious with regression
▶ Be careful with concepts
T
he world of statistics is full of pitfalls, but it’s also full of opportunities. 
Whether you’re a user of statistics or someone who has to interpret them, 
it’s possible to fall into the pitfalls. It’s also possible to walk around them. Here 
are ten tips and traps from the areas of hypothesis testing, regression, correla-
tion, and graphs.
Significant Doesn’t Always 
Mean Important
As I say earlier in the book, “significance” is, in many ways, a poorly chosen 
term. When a statistical test yields a significant result, and the decision is to 
reject H0, that doesn’t guarantee that the study behind the data is an impor-
tant one. Statistics can only help decision making about numbers and infer-
ences about the processes that produced them. They can’t make those 
processes important or earth shattering. Importance is something you have 
to judge for yourself — and no statistical test can do that for you.

370
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Trying to Not Reject a Null Hypothesis 
Has a Number of Implications
Let me tell you a story: Some years ago, an industrial firm was trying to show 
it was finally in compliance with environmental cleanup laws. They took 
numerous measurements of the pollution in the body of water surrounding 
their factory, compared the measurements with a null hypothesis-generated 
set of expectations, and found that they couldn’t reject H0 with α = .05. Their 
measurements didn’t differ significantly (there’s that word again) from 
“clean” water.
This, the company claimed, was evidence that they had cleaned up their 
act. Closer inspection revealed that their data approached significance, but 
the pollution wasn’t quite of a high enough magnitude to reject H0. Does this 
mean they’re not polluting?
Not at all. In striving to “prove” a null hypothesis, they had stacked the deck 
in favor of themselves. They set a high barrier to get over, didn’t clear it, and 
then patted themselves on the back. 
Every so often, it’s appropriate to try and not reject H0. When you set out on 
that path, be sure to set a high value of α (about .20-.30), so that small diver-
gences from H0 cause rejection of H0. (I discuss this in Chapter 10 and I men-
tion it in other parts of the book. I think it’s important enough to mention 
again here.)
Regression Isn’t Always linear
When trying to fit a regression model to a scatterplot, the temptation is to 
immediately use a line. This is the best-understood regression model, and 
when you get the hang of it, slopes and intercepts aren’t all that daunting.
But linear regression isn’t the only kind of regression. It’s possible to fit a 
curve through a scatterplot. I won’t kid you: The statistical concepts behind 
curvilinear regression are more difficult to understand than the concepts 
behind linear regression. 
It’s worth taking the time to master those concepts, however. Sometimes, 
a curve is a much better fit than a line. (This is partly a plug for Chapter 20, 
where I take you through curvilinear regression — and some of the concepts 
behind it.)

371
 Chapter 19: Ten Statistical and Graphical Tips and Traps
Extrapolating Beyond a Sample 
Scatterplot Is a Bad Idea
Whether you’re working with linear regression or curvilinear regression, 
keep in mind that it’s inappropriate to generalize beyond the boundaries of 
the scatterplot. 
Suppose you’ve established a solid predictive relationship between a test of 
mathematics aptitude and performance in mathematics courses, and your 
scatterplot only covers a narrow range of mathematics aptitude. You have 
no way of knowing whether the relationship holds up beyond that range. 
Predictions outside that range aren’t valid. 
Your best bet is to expand the scatterplot by testing more people. You might 
find that the original relationship only tells part of the story.
Examine the Variability Around 
a Regression Line
Careful analysis of residuals (the differences between observed and pre-
dicted values) can tell you a lot about how well the line fits the data. A foun-
dational assumption is that variability around a regression line is the same 
up and down the line. If it isn’t, the model might not be as predictive as you 
think. If the variability is systematic (greater variability at one end than at 
the other), curvilinear regression might be more appropriate than linear. The 
standard error of estimate won’t always be the indicator. 
A Sample Can Be Too Large
Believe it or not. This sometimes happens with correlation coefficients. A 
very large sample can make a small correlation coefficient statistically sig-
nificant. For example, with 100 degrees of freedom and α = .05, a correlation 
coefficient of .195 is cause for rejecting the null hypothesis that the popula-
tion correlation coefficient is equal to zero. 
But what does that correlation coefficient really mean? The coefficient of 
determination — r2 — is just .038, meaning that the SSRegression is less than 4 
percent of the SSTotal (See Chapter 16.) That’s a very small association.

372
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Bottom line: When looking at a correlation coefficient, be aware of the sample 
size. If it’s large enough, it can make a trivial association turn out statistically 
significant. (Hmmm . . . “significance” . . . there it is again!)
Consumers: Know Your Axes
When you look at a graph, make sure that you know what’s on each axis. 
Make sure that you understand the units of measure. Do you understand the 
independent variable? Do you understand the dependent variable? Can you 
describe each one in your own words? If the answer to any of those ques-
tions is “No,” you don’t understand the graph you’re looking at. 
When looking at a graph in a TV ad, be very wary if it disappears too quickly, 
before you can see what’s on the axes. The advertiser may be trying to create 
a lingering false impression about a bogus relationship inside the graph. The 
graphed relationship might be as valid as that other staple of TV advertising — 
scientific proof via animated cartoon: Tiny animated scrub brushes cleaning 
cartoon teeth might not necessarily guarantee whiter teeth for you if you buy 
the product. (I know that’s off-topic, but I had to get it in.)
Graphing a Categorical Variable as 
Though It’s a Quantitative Variable 
Is Just Wrong
So you’re just about ready to compete in the Rock-Paper-Scissors World 
Series. In preparation for this international tournament, you’ve tallied all 
your matches from the past ten years, listing the percentage of times you 
won when you played each role. 
To summarize all the outcomes, you’re about to use Excel’s graphics capa-
bilities to create a graph. One thing’s sure: Whatever your preference rock-
paper-scissors-wise, the graph absolutely, positively had better NOT look like 
Figure 19-1.
So many people create these kinds of graphs — people who should know 
better. The line in the graph implies continuity from one point to another. 
With these data, of course, that’s impossible. What’s between Rock and 
Paper? Why are they equal units apart? Why are the three categories in that 
order? (Can you tell this is my pet peeve?)

373
 Chapter 19: Ten Statistical and Graphical Tips and Traps
 
Figure 19-1: 
Absolutely 
the wrong 
way to 
graph cat-
egorical 
data. 
 
Simply put, a line graph is not the proper graph when at least one of your 
variables is a set of categories. Instead, create a column graph. A pie chart 
works here, too, because the data are percentages and you have just a few 
slices. (See Chapter 3 for Yogi Berra’s pie-slice guidelines.)
When I wrote the first edition of this book, I whimsically came up with the idea 
of a Rock Paper Scissors World Series for this example. Between then and now, 
I found out . . . there really is one! (The World RPS Society puts it on.)
Whenever Appropriate, Include 
Variability in Your Graph
When the points in your graph represent means, make sure that the graph 
includes the standard error of each mean. This gives the viewer an idea of 
the variability in the data — which is an important aspect of the data. Here’s 
another plug: In Chapter 20, I show you how to do that in Excel.
Means by themselves don’t always tell you the whole story. Take every 
opportunity to examine variances and standard deviations. You may find 
some hidden nuggets. Systematic variation — high values of variance associ-
ated with large means, for example — might be a clue about a relationship 
you didn’t see before. (Appendix C shows you some additional ways to 
explore data.)

374
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Be Careful When Relating Statistics-Book 
Concepts to Excel
If you’re serious about doing statistical work, you’ll probably have occasion 
to look into a statistics text or two. Bear in mind that the symbols in some 
areas of statistics aren’t standard: For example, some texts use M rather 
than to represent the sample mean, and some represent a deviation from the 
mean with just x. 
Connecting textbook concepts to Excel’s statistical functions can be a chal-
lenge, because of the texts and because of Excel. Messages on dialog boxes 
and in help files might contain symbols other than the ones you read about, 
or they might use the same symbols but in a different way. The discrepancy 
might lead you to make an incorrect entry into a parameter in a dialog box, 
resulting in an error that’s hard to trace.

Didn’t Fit in Any Other Chapter
In This Chapter
▶ What’s in the forecast?
▶ Visualizing variability
▶ Odds and ends of probability
▶ Looking for independence
▶ Logging out
▶ Importing data
I
 wrote this book to show you all of Excel’s statistical capabilities. My 
intent was to tell you about them in the context of the world of statistics, 
and I had a definite path in mind. 
Some of the capabilities don’t neatly fit along that path. I still want you to be 
aware of them, however, so here they are.
Some Forecasting
Here are a couple of useful techniques to help you come up with some fore-
casts. Although they didn’t quite fit into the regression chapter, and they 
really didn’t go into the descriptive statistics chapters, so they deserve a sec-
tion of their own. 
A moving experience
In many contexts, it makes sense to gather data over periods of time. When 
you do this, you have a time series. 

376
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Investors often have to base their decisions on time series — like stock 
prices — and the numbers in a time series typically show numerous ups 
and downs. A mean that takes all the peaks and valleys into account might 
obscure the big picture of the overall trend. 
One way to smooth out the bumps and see the big picture is to calculate a 
moving average. This is an average calculated from the most recent scores in 
the time series. It moves because you keep calculating it over the time series. 
As you add a score to the front end, you delete one from the back end.
Suppose you have daily stock prices of a particular stock for the last 20 days, 
and you decide to keep a moving average for the most recent 5 days. Start 
with the average from days 1–5 of those 20 days. Then average the prices 
from days 2–6. Next, average days 3–7, and so on, until you average the final 5 
days of the time series. 
Excel’s Moving Average data analysis tool does the work for you. Figure 20-1 
shows a fictional company’s stock prices for 20 days, and the dialog box for 
the Moving Average tool. 
 
Figure 20-1: 
Fictional 
stock prices 
and the 
Moving 
Average 
dialog box.
 
The figure shows my entries for Moving Average. The Input Range is cells A1 
through A21, the Labels in First Row checkbox is checked, and the Interval 
is 5. That means that each average consists of the most recent five days. 
Cells B2 through B21 are the output range, and I checked the boxes for Chart 
Output and for Standard Errors.
The results are in Figure 20-2. Ignore the ugly-looking #N/A symbols. Each 
number in Column B is a moving average — a forecast of the price on the 
basis of the most recent five days. 

377
 Chapter 20: Ten Things (Twelve, Actually) That Didn’t Fit in Any Other Chapter
Each number in Column C is a standard error. In this context, a standard 
error is the square root of the average of the squared difference between the 
price and the forecast for the previous five days. So the first standard error 
in cell C10 is
 
Figure 20-2: 
The results: 
moving 
averages 
and stan-
dard errors.
 
The graph (stretched out from its original appearance and with a reformat-
ted vertical axis) shows the moving average in the series labeled Forecast. 
Sometimes the forecast matches up with the data, sometimes it doesn’t. 
As the figure shows, the moving average smoothes out the peaks and valleys 
in the price data. 
In general, how many scores do you include? That’s up to you. Include too 
many and you risk obsolete data influencing your result. Include too few and 
you risk missing something important. 
How to be a smoothie, exponentially
Exponential smoothing is similar to a moving average. It’s a technique for 
forecasting based on prior data. In contrast with the moving average, which 
works just with a sequence of actual values, exponential smoothing takes its 
previous prediction into account. 

378
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Exponential smoothing operates according to a damping factor, a number 
between zero and one. With α representing the damping factor, the formula is
In terms of stock prices from the preceding example, yt’ represents the pre-
dicted stock price at a time t. If t is today, t-1 is yesterday. So yt-1 is yester-
day’s actual price and y’t-1 is yesterday’s predicted price. The sequence of 
predictions begins with the first predicted value as the observed value from 
the day before. 
A larger damping factor gives more weight to yesterday’s prediction. A 
smaller damping factor gives greater weight to yesterday’s actual value. A 
damping factor of 0.5 weighs each one equally.
Figure 20-3 shows the dialog box for the Exponential Smoothing data 
analysis tool. It’s similar to the Moving Average tool, except for the Damping 
Factor box.
 
Figure 20-3: 
The 
Exponential 
Smoothing

I applied Exponential Smoothing to the data from the previous example. I 
did this three times with 0.1, 0.5, and 0.9 as the damping factors. Figure 20-4 
shows the graphic output for each result. 
The highest damping factor, 0.9, results in the flattest sequence of predic-
tions. The lowest, 0.1, predicts the most pronounced set of peaks and valleys. 
How should you set the damping factor? Like the interval in the moving aver-
age, that’s up to you. Your experience and the specific area of application are 
the determining factors.
 
In Appendix C, I show you another technique for smoothing. That one is based 
on medians.

Graphing the Standard Error of the Mean
When you create a graph and your data are means, it’s a good idea to include 
the standard error of each mean in your graph. This gives the viewer an idea 
of the spread of scores around each mean. 
Figure 20-5 gives an example of a situation where this arises. The data are 
(fictional) scores for four groups of people on a test. Each column header 
indicates the amount of preparation time for the eight people within the 
group. I used Excel’s graphics capabilities (Chapter 3) to draw the graph. 
Because the independent variable is quantitative, a line graph is appropriate. 
(See Chapter 19 for a rant on my biggest peeve.)
For each group I used AVERAGE to calculate the mean and STDEV to cal-
culate the standard deviation. I also calculated the standard error of each 
mean. I selected cell B12, so the formula box shows you that I calculated the 
standard error for column B via this formula:
=B11/SQRT(COUNT(B2:B9))
The trick is to get each standard error into the graph. In Excel 2007, it’s a 
snap. Begin by selecting the graph. This causes the Design, Layout, and 
Format tabs to appear. Select Layout | Error Bars

In this menu, you have to be careful. One selection is Error Bars with Standard 
Error. Avoid it. If you think this selection tells Excel to put the standard error 
of each mean on the graph, rest assured that Excel has absolutely no idea of 
what you’re talking about. For this selection, Excel calculates the standard 
error of the set of four means — not the standard error within each group.
Instead, in that menu, pick the final choice, More Error Bar options. This 
opens the Format Error Bars dialog box. (See Figure 20-7.)

The Format

In the Display area, click the radio button next to Both (for Direction) and the 
radio button next to Cap (for End Style). 
 
Remember the cautionary note I gave you a moment ago? I’ve got a similar 
one here. One selection in the Error Amount area is Standard Error. Avoid this 
one, too. It does not tell Excel to put the standard error of each mean on the 
graph.
In the Error Amount area, click the radio button next to Custom. This acti-
vates the Specify Value button. Click that button to open the Custom Error 
Bars dialog box shown in Figure 20-8. With the cursor in the Positive Error 
Value box, select the cell range that holds the standard errors ($B$12:$E$12). 
Move the cursor to the Negative Error Value box and do the same.

That Negative Error Value box might give you a little trouble. Make sure that 
it’s cleared of any default values before you enter the cell range.
Click OK on the Custom Error Bars dialog box, close the Format Error Bars

This, by the way, is a good example of how the Ribbon expands the user 
experience. In previous Excel versions it was difficult to access the Error Bar 
capability, or to even know it was available. Buried under a tab in a dialog 
box, Error Bars seldom saw the light of day. The Ribbon, on the other hand, 
makes them immediately visible, as Figure 20-6 shows.

Probabilities and Distributions
Here are some probability-related worksheet functions. A little on the eso-
teric side, you might find some use for them.
PROB
If you have a probability distribution of a discrete random variable, and you 
want to find the probability that the variable takes on a particular value, 
PROB is for you. Figure 20-10 shows the PROB Argument Functions dialog 
box along with a distribution.
 
Figure 20-10: 
The PROB 
Function 
Arguments 
dialog 
box and a 
probability 
distribution.
 
You supply the random variable (X_range), the probabilities (Prob_range), 
a Lower Limit, and an Upper Limit. PROB returns the probability that the 
random variable takes on a value between those limits.
WEIBULL
This is a probability density function that’s mostly applicable to engineering. 
It serves as a model for the time until a physical system fails. As engineers 
know, in some systems, the number of failures stays the same over time 
because shocks to the system cause failure. In others, like some micro-
electronic components, the number of failures decreases with time. In still 
others, wear and tear increase failures with time.

384
Part V: The Part of Tens 
The Weibull distribution’s two parameters allow it to reflect all these possi-
bilities. One parameter, Alpha, determines how wide or narrow the distribu-
tion is. The other, Beta, determines where it’s centered on the x-axis.
The Weibull probability density function is a rather complicated equa-
tion. Thanks to Excel, you don’t have to worry about it. Figure 20-11 shows 
WEIBULL’s Function Arguments dialog box.
 
Figure 20-11: 
The 
WEIBULL 
Function 
Arguments 
dialog box.
 
The dialog box in the figure answers the kind of question a product engineer 
would ask: Assume the time to failure of a bulb in an LCD projector follows 
a Weibull distribution with Alpha = .75 and Beta = 2000 hours. What’s the 
probability the bulb lasts at most 4000 hours? The dialog box shows that the 
answer is .814.
Drawing Samples
Excel’s Sampling data analysis tool is helpful for creating samples. You can 
tailor it in a couple of ways. If you’re trying to put a focus group together and 
you have to select the participants from a pool of people, you could assign 
each one a number, and have the Sampling tool select your group. 
One way to select is periodically. You supply n, and Excel samples every nth 
number. The other way to select is randomly. You supply the number of indi-
viduals you want randomly selected and Excel does the rest.
Figure 20-12 presents the Sampling dialog box, three groups I had it sample 
from, and two columns of output. 
The first output column, Column A, shows the results of periodic sampling 
with a period of 6. Sampling begins with the sixth score in Group 1. Excel 
then counts out scores and delivers the sixth, and goes through that process 

385
 Chapter 20: Ten Things (Twelve, Actually) That Didn’t Fit in Any Other Chapter
again until it finishes in the last group. The periodic sampling process, as you 
can see, doesn’t recycle. I supplied an output range up to cell A11, but Excel 
stopped after four numbers.
 
Figure 20-12: 
The Sam-
pling data 
analysis tool 
dialog box, 
sampled 
groups, and 
results.
 
The second output column, Column B, shows the results of random sampling. 
I asked for 20 and that’s what I got. If you closely examine the numbers in 
Column B, you’ll see that the random sampling process can select a number 
more than once.
 
Beware of a little quirk: The Labels checkbox seems to have no effect. When I 
specified an input range that includes C1, D1, and E1, and checked the Labels 
checkbox, I received an error message: “Sampling - Input range contains non-
numeric data.” Not a showstopper, but a little annoying.
Testing Independence: The True 
Use of CHITEST
In Chapter 18, I show you how to use CHITEST to test the goodness of fit of 
a model to a set of data. At the time, I warned you about the pitfalls of using 
this function in that context, and I mentioned that it’s really intended for 
something else.
Here’s the something else. Imagine you’ve surveyed a total of 200 people. 
Each person lives in either a rural area, an urban area, or a suburb. Your 
survey asked them their favorite type of movie — drama, comedy, or anima-
tion. You want to know if their movie preference is independent of the envi-
ronment in which they live.

386
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Table 20-1 shows the results.

The number in each cell represents the number of people in the environment 
indicated in the row who prefer the type of movie indicated in the column.
Do the data show that preference is independent of environment? This calls 
for a hypothesis test:
H0: Movie preference is independent of environment
H1: Not H0
α= .05
To get this done, you have to know what to expect if the two are indepen-
dent. Then you can compare the data with the expected numbers and see if 
they match. If they do, you can’t reject H0. If they don’t, you reject H0.
Concepts from probability help determine the expected data. In Chapter 16, I 
tell you that if two events are independent, you multiply their probabilities to 
find the probability that they occur together. Here, you can treat the tabled 
numbers as proportions, and the proportions as probabilities. 
For example, in your sample, the probability is 80/200 that a person is from 
a rural environment. The probability is 70/200 that a person prefers drama. 
What’s the probability that a person is in the category “rural and likes 
drama”? If the environment and preference are independent, that’s (80/200) 
× (70/200). To turn that probability into an expected number of people, 
you multiply it by the total number of people in the sample — 200. So the 
expected number of people is (80 × 70)/200, which is 28. 
In general, 

387
 Chapter 20: Ten Things (Twelve, Actually) That Didn’t Fit in Any Other Chapter
After you have the expected numbers, you compare them to the observed 
numbers (the data) via this formula:
You test the result against a χ2 (chi-square) distribution with df = (Number of 
Rows – 1) X (Number of Columns – 1), which in this case comes out to 4.
The CHITEST worksheet function performs the test. You supply the observed 
numbers and the expected numbers, and CHITEST returns the probability that a 
χ2 at least as high as the result from the preceding formula could have resulted if 
the two types of categories are independent. If the probability is small (less than 
.05), reject H0. If not, don’t reject. CHITEST doesn’t return a value of χ2, it just 
returns the probability (under a χ2 distribution with the correct df).
Figure 20-13 shows a worksheet with both the observed data and the expected 
numbers, along with CHITEST’s Function Arguments dialog box. Before I ran 
CHITEST I attached the name Observed to D3:F5, and the name Expected to 
D10:F12. (If you don’t remember how to do this, reread Chapter 2.)

388
Part V: The Part of Tens 
The figure shows that I’ve entered Observed into the Actual_range box, and 
Expected into the Expected_range box. The dialog box shows a very small 
probability, .00068, so the decision is to reject H0. The data are consistent 
with the idea that movie preference is not independent of environment.
Logarithmica Esoterica
 
The functions in this section are really out there. Unless you’re a tech-head, 
you’ll probably never use them. I present them for completeness. You might 
run into them while you’re wandering through Excel’s statistical functions, 
and wonder what they are.
They’re based on what mathematicians call natural logarithms, which in turn 
are based on e, that constant I use at various points throughout the book. I 
begin with a brief discussion of logarithms, and then I turn to e.
What is a logarithm?
Plain and simple, a logarithm is an exponent — a power to which you raise a 
number. In the equation 
2 is an exponent. Does that mean that 2 is also a logarithm? Well . . . yes. In 
terms of logarithms, 
That’s really just another way of saying 102 = 100. Mathematicians read it as 
“the logarithm of 100 to the base 10 equals 2.” It means that if you want to 
raise 10 to some power to get 100, that power is 2.
How about 1,000? As you know
so 
How about 453? Uh . . . Hmmm . . . That’s like trying to solve

389
 Chapter 20: Ten Things (Twelve, Actually) That Didn’t Fit in Any Other Chapter
What could that answer possibly be? 102 means 10 × 10 and that gives you 
100. 103 means 10 × 10 × 10 and that’s 1,000. But 453? 
Here’s where you have to think outside the dialog box. You have to imag-
ine exponents that aren’t whole numbers. I know, I know . . . how can you 
multiply a number by itself a fraction at a time? If you could, somehow, the 
number in that 453 equation would have to be between 2 (which gets you to 
100) and 3 (which gets you to 1,000). 
In the 16th century, mathematician John Napier showed how to do it and 
logarithms were born. Why did Napier bother with this? One reason is that 
it was a great help to astronomers. Astronomers have to deal with numbers 
that are . . . well . . . astronomical. Logarithms ease computational strain in a 
couple of ways. One way is to substitute small numbers for large ones: The 
logarithm of 1,000,000 is 6 and the logarithm of 100,000,000 is 8. Also, working 
with logarithms opens up a helpful set of computational shortcuts. Before 
calculators and computers appeared on the scene, this was a very big deal.
Incidentally,
meaning that
You can use Excel to check that out if you don’t believe me. Select a cell and 
type 
=LOG(453,10)
press Enter, and watch what happens. Then just to close the loop, reverse 
the process. If your selected cell is — let’s say — D3, select another cell 
and type
=POWER(10,D3)
or
=10^D3
Either way, the result is 453.
Ten, the number that’s raised to the exponent, is called the base. Because it’s 
also the base of our number system and we’re so familiar with it, logarithms 
of base 10 are called common logarithms. 

390
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Does that mean you can have other bases? Absolutely. Any number (except 0 
or 1 or a negative number) can be a base. For example,
So
If you ever see log without a base, base 10 is understood, so 
In terms of bases, one number is special . . .
What is e?
Which brings me to e, a constant that’s all about growth. Before I get back to 
logarithms, I’ll tell you about e.
Imagine the princely sum of $1 deposited in a bank account. Suppose the 
interest rate is 2 percent a year. (Good luck with that.) If it’s simple interest, 
the bank adds $.02 every year, and in 50 years you have $2. 
If it’s compound interest, at the end of 50 years you have (1 + .02)50 — which 
is just a bit more than $2.68, assuming the bank compounds the interest once 
a year. 
Of course, if they compound it twice a year, each payment is $.01, and after 
50 years they’ve compounded it 100 times. That gives you (1 + .01)100, or just 
over $2.70. What about compounding it four times a year? After 50 years — 
200 compoundings — you have (1 + .005)200 which results in the don’t-spend-
it-all-in-one-place amount of $2.71 and a tiny bit more. 
Focusing on “just a bit more” and a “tiny bit more,” and taking it to extremes, 
after one hundred thousand compoundings you have $2.718268. After one 
hundred million, you have $2.718282.
If you could get the bank to compound many more times in those 50 years, 
your sum of money approaches a limit — an amount it gets ever so close to, 
but never quite reaches. That limit is e.
The way I set up the example, the rule for calculating the amount is 

391
 Chapter 20: Ten Things (Twelve, Actually) That Didn’t Fit in Any Other Chapter
where n represents the number of payments. Two cents is 1/50th of a dollar 
and I specified 50 years — 50 payments. Then I specified two payments a 
year (and each year’s payments have to add up to 2 percent), so that in 50 
years you have 100 payments of 1/100th of a dollar, and so on.
To see this in action, enter numbers into a column of a spreadsheet as I have 
in Figure 20-14. In cells C2 through C20, I have the numbers 1 through 10 and 
then selected steps through one hundred million. In D2, I put this formula
=(1+(1/C2))^C2
and then autofilled to D20. The entry in D20 is very close to e. 
 
Figure 20-14: 
Getting to e.
 
Mathematicians can tell you another way to get to e:
Those exclamation points signify factorial. 1! = 1, 2! = 2 X 1, 3! = 3 X 2 X 1. (For 
more on factorials, see Chapter 16).
Excel helps visualize this one, too. Figure 20-15 lays out a spreadsheet with 
selected numbers up to 170 in Column C. In D2, I put this formula:
=1+ 1/FACT(C2)
and, as the Formula Bar in the Figure shows, in D3 I put this one:
=D2 +1/ FACT(C3)
Then I autofilled up to D17. The entry in D17 is very close to e. In fact, from 
D11 on, you see no change, even if you increase the amount of decimal places.

392
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
Figure 20-15: 
Another 
path to e.
 
Why did I stop at 170? Because that takes Excel to the max. At 171, you get an 
error message.
So e is associated with growth. Its value is 2.781828 . . . The three dots mean 
you never quite get to the exact value (like π, the constant that enables you 
to find the area of a circle).
This number pops up in all kinds of places. It’s in the formula for the normal 
distribution (see Chapter 8), and it’s in distributions I discuss in Chapter 17. 
Many natural phenomena are related to e.
It’s so important that scientists, mathematicians, and business analysts use 
it as the base for logarithms. Logarithms to the base e are called natural loga-
rithms. A natural logarithm is abbreviated as ln. 
Table 20-2 presents some comparisons (rounded to three decimal places) 
between common logarithms and natural logarithms:

 Chapter 20: Ten Things (Twelve, Actually) That Didn’t Fit in Any Other Chapter
One more thing. In many formulas and equations, it’s often necessary to raise 
e to a power. Sometimes the power is a fairly complicated mathematical 
expression. Because superscripts are usually printed in small font, it can be 
a strain to have to constantly read them. To ease the eyestrain, mathemati-
cians have invented a special notation: exp. Whenever you see exp followed 
by something in parentheses, it means to raise e to the power of whatever’s 
in the parentheses. For example,
Excel’s EXP function does that calculation for you.
Speaking of raising e, when Google, Inc., filed their IPO they said they wanted 
to raise $2,718,281,828, which is e times a billion dollars rounded to the near-
est dollar.
On to the Excel functions.
LOGNORMDIST
A random variable is said to be lognormally distributed if its natural loga-
rithm is normally distributed. Maybe the name is a little misleading, because I 
just said log means “common logarithm” and ln means “natural logarithm.”
Unlike the normal distribution, the lognormal can’t have a negative number 
as a possible value for the variable. Also unlike the normal, the lognormal is 
not symmetric — it’s skewed to the right.
Like the Weibull distribution I describe earlier, engineers use it to model the 
breakdown of physical systems — particularly of the wear-and-tear variety. 
Here’s where the large-numbers-to-small numbers property of logarithms 
comes into play. When huge numbers of hours figure into a system’s life 
cycle, it’s easier to think about the distribution of logarithms than the distri-
bution of the hours.
Excel’s LOGNORMDIST works with the lognormal distribution. You specify 
a value, a mean, and a standard deviation for the lognormal. LOGNORMDIST 
returns the probability that the variable is, at most, that value. 
For example, the FarKlempt Robotics Inc. has gathered extensive hours-to-
failure data on a universal joint component that goes into their robots. They 
find that hours-to-failure is lognormally distributed with a mean of 10 and a 
standard deviation of 2.5. What is the probability that this component fails in, 
at most, 10,000 hours? 

394
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Figure 20-16 shows the LOGNORMDIST Function Arguments dialog box for 
this example. In the X box, I entered ln(10000). I entered 10 into the Mean box 
and 2.5 into the Standard_dev box. The dialog box shows the answer, .000929 
(and some more decimals).

LOGINV
LOGINV turns LOGNORMDIST around. You supply a probability, a mean, 
and a standard deviation for a lognormal distribution. LOGINV gives you the 
value of the random variable that cuts off that probability.
To find the value that cuts off .001 in the preceding example’s distribution, I 
used the LOGINV dialog box in Figure 20-17. With the indicated entries, the 
dialog box shows that the value is 9.722 (and more decimals).

By the way, in terms of hours that’s 16,685 — just for .001.

Array Function: LOGEST
In Chapter 14, I tell you all about linear regression. It’s also possible to have a 
relationship between two variables that’s curvilinear rather than linear.
The equation for a line that fits a scatterplot is 
One way to fit a curve through a scatterplot is with this equation:
LOGEST estimates a and b for this curvilinear equation. Figure 20-18 shows 
the LOGEST function arguments dialog box and the data for this example. It 
also shows an array for the results. Before using this function, I attached the 
name x to B2:B12 and y to C2:C12.
 
Figure 20-18: 
The 
Function 
Arguments

for LOGEST, 
along with 
the data and 
the selected

results.
 
Here are the steps for this function: 
 
1. With the data entered, select a five-row-by-two-column array of cells 
for LOGEST’s results.
 
 I selected F4:G8.
 
2. From the Statistical Functions menu, select LOGEST to open the 
Function Arguments dialog box for LOGEST.

396
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
3. In the Function Arguments dialog box, type the appropriate values for 
the arguments.
 
 In the Known_y’s box, type the cell range that holds the scores for the 
y-variable. For this example, that’s y (the name I gave to C2:C12).
 
 In the Known_x’s box, type the cell range that holds the scores for the 
x-variable. For this example, it’s x (the name I gave to B2:B12).
 
 In the Const box, the choices are TRUE (or leave it blank) to calculate 
the value of a in the curvilinear equation I showed you or FALSE to set a 
to 1. I typed TRUE. 
 
 The dialog box uses b where I use a. No set of symbols is standard.
 
 In the Stats box, the choices are TRUE to return the regression statistics 
in addition to a and b, FALSE (or leave it blank) to return just a and b. I 
typed TRUE.
 
 Again, the dialog box uses b where I use a and m-coefficient where I use b.
 
4. IMPORTANT: Do NOT click OK. Because this is an array function, 
press Ctrl+Shift+Enter to put LOGEST’s answers into the selected 
array.
Figure 20-19 shows LOGEST’s results. They’re not labeled in any way, so I added 
the labels for you in the worksheet. The left column gives you the exp(b) — 
more on that in a moment, standard error of b, R Square, F, and the SSregression. 
The right column provides a, standard error of a, standard error of estimate, 
degrees of freedom, and SSresidual. For more on these statistics, see Chapters 
14 and 15.

About exp(b). LOGEST, unfortunately, doesn’t return the value of b — the 
exponent for the curvilinear equation. To find the exponent, you have to cal-
culate the natural logarithm of what it does return. Applying Excel’s LN work-
sheet function here gives 0.0256 as the value of the exponent. 

397
 Chapter 20: Ten Things (Twelve, Actually) That Didn’t Fit in Any Other Chapter
So the curvilinear regression equation for the sample data is:
or in that exp notation I told you about,
 
A good way to help yourself understand all of this is to use Excel’s graphics 
capabilities to create a scatterplot. (See Chapter 3.) Then right-click on a data 
point in the plot and select Add Trendline from the pop-up menu. That opens 
the Format Trendline dialog box (Figure 20-20). Click the radio button next to 
Exponential, as I’ve done in the figure. Also, as I’ve done in the figure, toward 
the bottom of the dialog box click the checkbox next to Display Equation on 
Chart.

Array Function: GROWTH
GROWTH is curvilinear regression’s answer to TREND (Chapter 14). You can 
use this function two ways — to predict a set of y-values for the x-values in 
your sample, or to predict a set of y-values for a new set of x-values. 
Predicting y’s for the x’s in your sample
Figure 20-22 shows GROWTH set up to calculate y’s for the x’s I already have. 
I included the Formula Bar in this screen shot so you can see what the for-
mula looks like for this use of GROWTH.
Here are the steps:

1. With the data entered, select a cell range for GROWTH’s answers.
 
 I selected D2:D12 to put the predicted y’s right next to the sample y’s.
 
2. From the Statistical Functions menu, select GROWTH to open the 
Function Arguments dialog box for GROWTH.
 
3. In the Function Arguments dialog box, type the appropriate values for 
the arguments.
 
 In the Known_y’s box, type the cell range that holds the scores for the 
y-variable. For this example, that’s y (the name I gave to C2:C12).
 
 In the Known_x’s box, type the cell range that holds the scores for the 
x-variable. For this example, it’s x (the name I gave to B2:B12).
 
 I’m not calculating values for new x’s here, so I leave the New_x’s box 
blank.
 
 In the Const box, the choices are TRUE (or leave it blank) to calculate 
a, or FALSE to set a to 1. I entered TRUE. (I really don’t know why you’d 
enter FALSE.) Once again, the dialog uses b where I use a.
 
4. IMPORTANT: Do NOT click OK. Because this is an array function, 
press Ctrl+Shift+Enter to put GROWTH’s answers into the selected 
column. 
 
 Figure 20-23 shows the answers in D2:D12.

Predicting a new set of y’s for a new set of x’s
Here, I use GROWTH to predict y’s for a new set of x’s. Figure 20-24 shows 
GROWTH set up for this. In addition to the array named x and the array 
named y, I defined New_x as the name for B15:B22, the cell range that holds 
the new set of x’s. 
Figure 20-24 also shows the selected array of cells for the results. Once 
again, I included the Formula Bar to show you the formula for this use of the 
function.

When Your Data Live Elsewhere
In a few places throughout the book, I use data from the history of baseball. 
Happily, the Web site www.baseball-reference.com provides these data. 
How did I get these data from a web page into a worksheet?
It’s way easier than you might think. To take the first giant step, I select  
Data| Get External Data
and then choose the type of data source I’m dealing with. Figure 20-26 shows 
how to do it.
 
Figure 20-26: 
Selecting

As you can see, you can import from a number of different types of sources. 
Here, I just discuss data import from the web. To illustrate, I import data 
from the Web site of Wiley Publishing. 

402
Part V: The Part of Tens 
After I choose From Web, the New Web Query window opens within the 
spreadsheet. The window displays the home page that appears when I open 
my browser. In the Address box, I enter the address of the Web page that 
supplies the data. Specifically, I typed Wiley.com into the Address box. When 
I clicked Go, the window opened the page with this URL:
www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/ 
Figure 20-27 shows the appearance of the New Web Query window with 
this URL.

The important items to note here are the right-pointing arrows throughout 
the window. You can’t see it on the figure, but those arrows are in yellow. 
Each one points to a grouping of data you can import into Excel. 
I clicked the arrow next to ABOUT WILEY. Then I clicked Import. The Import 
Data dialog box opens and gives the choice of putting the data into the exist-
ing worksheet or a new one. I chose the existing worksheet, and specified cell 
A1 as the starting point for the table. (I could have also selected a cell before 
I opened the New Web Query window.) Then I clicked OK. Figure 20-28 shows 
the result.

Appendix A
When Your Worksheet 
Is a Database
In This Chapter
▶ Databases in Excel 
▶ Statistics in databases
▶ Pivot tables
E
xcel’s main function in life is to perform calculations. As the chapters in 
this book show, many of those calculations revolve around built-in sta-
tistical capabilities.
You can also set up a worksheet to store information in something like a 
database, although Excel is not as sophisticated as a dedicated database 
package. Excel offers database functions that are much like its statistical 
functions, so I thought I’d familiarize you with them.
Introducing Excel Databases
Strictly speaking, Excel provides a data list. This is an array of worksheet 
cells into which you enter related data in a uniform format. You organize the 
data in columns, and you put a name at the top of each column. In database 
terminology, each named column is a field. Each row is a separate record. 
This type of structure is useful for keeping inventories, as long as they’re not 
overly huge. You wouldn’t use an Excel database for recordkeeping in a ware-
house or a large corporation. For a small business, however, it might fit the bill.
The Satellites database
Figure A-1 shows an example. This is an inventory of the classic satellites in 
our solar system. By “classic,” I mean that astronomers discovered most of 

406
Statistical Analysis with Excel For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
them before the 20th century, via conventional telescopes. The three 20th-
century entries are so dim that astronomers discovered them by examin-
ing photographic plates. Today’s super telescopes and space probes have 
revealed many more satellites that I didn’t include.
 
Figure A-1: 
The 
Satellites 
database.
 
The database is in cells B10:G35. I defined Satellites as the name of this cell 
range. Notice that I included the field names in the range. (Reread Chapter 2 
if you don’t remember how to name a cell range.)
The Name field provides the name of the satellite; the Planet field indicates 
the planet around which the satellite revolves. 
Orbital_Period_Days shows how long it takes for a satellite to make a com-
plete revolution around its planet. Our Moon, for example, takes a little over 
27 days. A couple of records have negative values in this field. That means they 
revolve around the planet in a direction opposite to the planet’s rotation. 
Average Distance_X_1000_km is the average distance from the planet to the 
satellite in thousands of kilometers. The last two fields provide the year of 
discovery, and the astronomer who discovered the satellite. For our Moon, of 
course, those two are unknown.
 
After you label each field, you attach a name to each cell that holds a field 
name. Important point: The range for each name is just the cell that holds the 
field name, not the whole column of data. So here, I define Name as the name 
of the cell labeled Name. 

407
 Appendix A: When Your Worksheet Is a Database
Okay, I worked really hard to set up the premise for the preceding sentence. 
Here are two examples that are easier to follow: I define Planet as the name of 
cell C10, and Orbital_Period_Days as the name of D10, and so on. Now I can 
use these field names in Excel’s database formulas. 
The criteria range
I copied the column headers — excuse me, field names — into the top row. I 
also put some information into nearby cells. This area is for the criteria range. 
This range enables you to use Excel’s database functions to ask (and answer) 
questions about the data. Database honchos call this “querying.” Criteria are 
a part and parcel of each database function. (“Criteria” is plural. The singular 
form is “criterion.”)
It’s not necessary to have this range at the top of the worksheet. You can des-
ignate any range in the worksheet as the criteria range. 
When you use an Excel database function it’s in this format:
=FUNCTION(Database, Field, Criteria)
The function operates on the specified database, in the designated field, 
according to the indicated criteria. 
For example, if you want to know how many satellites revolve around Saturn, 
you select a cell and enter
=DCOUNT(Satellites,Average_Distance_X_1000_km,C1:C2)
Here’s what this formula means: In the database (B1:G35), DCOUNT tallies up 
the amount of number-containing cells in the Average_Distance_X_1000_km 
field, constrained by the criterion specified in the cell range C1:C2. That cri-
terion is equivalent to Planet = Saturn. Note that a criterion has to include at 
least one column header . . . uh . . . field name from the criteria range, and at 
least one row. Bear in mind that you can’t use the actual field name in the cri-
teria. You use the cell ID (like C1). 
When you include more than one row, you’re saying “or.” For example, if 
your criterion happens to be G1:G3, you’re specifying satellites discovered by 
Galileo or Cassini.
When you include more than one column in a criterion, you’re saying “and.” 
If your criterion is E1:F2, you’re specifying satellites farther than 150,000 km 
from their planets and discovered after 1877.

408
Statistical Analysis with Excel For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
The format of a database function
The formula I just showed you
=DCOUNT(Satellites,Average_Distance__X_1000_km,C1:C2)
is accessible via a Function Arguments dialog box, as is the case for all the 
other worksheet functions in Excel. Figure A-2 shows the equivalent dialog 
box for the preceding formula, set against the backdrop of the database and 
the criteria range. 
 
Figure A-2: 
The 
DCOUNT 
Function 
Arguments 
dialog box.
 
How do you open this dialog box? Unlike the Statistical Functions or the 
Math & Trig Functions, Database Functions do not reside on their own menu. 
Instead you click the Insert Function button to open the Insert Function 
dialog box. Then in that dialog box, you scroll down the list of functions until 
you find the database function you’re looking for.
Here’s an example:
 
1. Select a worksheet cell.
 
 As Figure A-2 shows, I selected H6.
 
2. Click the Insert Function button (it’s labeled fx) to open the Insert 
Function dialog box.

409
 Appendix A: When Your Worksheet Is a Database
 
3. In the Insert Function dialog box, select a function to open its 
Function Arguments dialog box.
 
 From the Database category, I selected DCOUNT and that’s the dialog 
box in Figure A-2.
 
4. In the Function Arguments dialog box, enter the appropriate values 
for the arguments.
 
 For the Database, I entered Satellites in the Database box. For the Field, 
I entered Average_Distance_X_1000_km in the Field box. This isn’t as 
keyboard intensive as it sounds. As I type along, a pop-up appears with 
the full name of the field name. Double-clicking the name puts it into the 
Field box. For the Range, I entered C1:C2 in the Range box.
 
 The answer, 9, appears in the dialog box.
 
5. Click OK to put the answer into the selected cell.
All the database functions follow the same format, you access them all the 
same way, and you fill in the same type of information in their dialog boxes. 
So I’m going to skip over that sequence of steps as I describe each function, 
and just discuss the equivalent worksheet formula.
Counting and Retrieving 
One essential database capability is to let you know how many records meet a 
particular criterion. Another is to retrieve records. Here are the Excel versions.
DCOUNT and DCOUNTA 
As I just showed you, DCOUNT counts records. The restriction is that the field 
you specify has to contain numbers. If it doesn’t, the answer is zero, as in
=DCOUNT(Satellites,Name,C1:C2)
because no records in the Name field contain numbers.
DCOUNTA counts records in a different way. This one works with any field. It 
counts the number of non-blank records in the field that satisfy the criterion. 
So this formula returns 9:
=DCOUNTA(Satellites,Name,C1:C2)

410
Statistical Analysis with Excel For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
Getting to “or”
Here’s a tally that involves “or”:
=DCOUNTA(Satellites,Name,D1:D3)
The criterion D1:D3 specifies satellites whose orbital period is 1.26 days or 
greater than 20 days — as I mention before, multiple rows mean “or.” Five sat-
ellites meet that criterion: Deimos, Hyperion, Iapetus, our Moon, and Nereid.
Wildcards
Look closely at Figure A-1 and you see the cryptic entry *io in Cell B2. I did 
that so you’d know that Excel database functions can deal with wildcard 
characters. The formula
=DCOUNTA(Satellites,Name,B1:B2)
returns 3, the number of satellites with the letter-string “io” anywhere in their 
names (Dione, Io, and Hyperion). 
DGET
DGET retrieves exactly one record. If the criteria you specify result in more 
than one record (or in no records), DGET returns an error message. 
This formula
=DGET(Satellites,Name,D1:D2)
retrieves “Deimos,” the name of the satellite whose orbital period is 1.26 days.
This one
=DGET(Satellites,Name,E1:E2)
results in an error message because the criterion specifies more than one 
record.
Arithmetic
Excel wouldn’t be Excel without calculation capabilities. Here are the ones it 
offers for its databases.

411
 Appendix A: When Your Worksheet Is a Database
DMAX and DMIN
As their names suggest, these provide the maximum value and the minimum 
value according to your specifications. The formula
=DMAX(Satellites,Orbital_Period__Days,E1:E2)
returns 360.14. This is the maximum orbital period for any satellite that’s far-
ther than 150,000 km from its planet.
For the minimum value that meets this criterion,
=DMIN(Satellites,Orbital_Period__Days,E1:E2)
gives you –550.48. That’s Phoebe, a satellite that revolves in the opposite 
direction to its planet’s rotation.
DSUM 
This one adds up the values in a field. To add all the orbital periods in the 
satellites discovered by Galileo or by Cassini, use this formula:
=DSUM(Satellites,Orbital_Period__Days,G1:G3)
That sum is 117.64.
 
Want to total up all the orbital periods? (I know, I know . . . =SUM(B11:B35). 
Just work with me here.)
This formula gets it done:
=DSUM(Satellites,Orbital_Period__Days,C1:C3)
Why? It’s all in the criterion. C1:C3 means that Planet = Saturn or . . . anything 
else, because C3 is empty. The sum, by the way, is 35.457. Bottom line: Be 
careful whenever you include an empty cell in your criteria.
DPRODUCT
Here’s a function that’s probably here only because Excel’s designers could 
create it. You specify the data values, and DPRODUCT multiplies them. 

412
Statistical Analysis with Excel For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
The formula
=DPRODUCT(Satellites,Orbital_Period__Days,G1:G2)
returns the product (749.832) of the orbital periods of the satellites Galileo 
discovered — a calculation I’m pretty sure Galileo never thought about.
Statistics
Which brings me to the statistical database functions. These work just like 
the similarly named worksheet functions.
DAVERAGE
Here’s the formula for the average of the orbital periods of satellites discov-
ered after 1887:
=DAVERAGE(Satellites,Orbital_Period__Days,F1:F2)
The average is negative (-36.4086) because the specification includes those 
two satellites with the negative orbital periods.
DVAR and DVARP
DVAR is the database counterpart of VAR, which divides the sum of N 
squared deviations by N-1. This is called sample variance. 
DVARP is the database counterpart of VARP, which divides the sum of N 
squared deviations by N. This is the population variance. (For details on VAR 
and VARP, sample variance and population variance, and the implications of 
N and N-1, see Chapter 5.)
Here’s the sample variance for the orbital period of satellites farther than 
150,000 km from their planets and discovered after 1877:
=DVAR(Satellites,Orbital_Period__Days,E1:F2)
That turns out to be 210,358.1.
The population variance for that same subset of satellites is
=DVARP(Satellites,Orbital_Period__Days,E1:F2)
which is 140,238.7.

413
 Appendix A: When Your Worksheet Is a Database
Once again, if you have multiple columns in the criteria, you’re dealing 
with “and.”
DSTDEV and DSTDEVP
These two return standard deviations. The standard deviation is the square 
root of the variance. (See Chapter 5.) DSTDEV returns the sample standard 
deviation, which is the square root of DVAR’s returned value. DSTDEVP 
returns the population standard deviation, the square root of DVARP’s 
returned value.
For the specifications in the preceding example, the sample standard devia-
tion is
=DSTDEV(Satellites,Orbital_Period__Days,E1:F2)
which is 458.6481.
The population standard deviation is
=DSTDEVP(Satellites,Orbital_Period__Days,E1:F2)
This result is 374.4846.
According to Form
Excel provides a Data Form to help you work with databases. Unfortunately, 
Excel 2007 didn’t put a button for this form on the Ribbon. To access this 
button, you have to put it on the Quick Access toolbar. 
Here’s how to do it:
 
1. Click the down arrow on the right of the Quick Access toolbar to open 
the Customize Quick Access Toolbar menu.
 
2. From this menu, select More Commands to open the Excel Options 
dialog box. 
 
3. In the Choose Commands From drop-down menu, select Commands 
Not in the Ribbon.
 
4. In the list box on the left, scroll down and select Form.
 
5. Click the Add button to put Form into the list box on the right.
 
6. Click OK to close the Excel Options dialog box.
 
 The Data Form button is now on the Quick Access toolbar.

414
Statistical Analysis with Excel For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
To use the Data Form, highlight the entire cell range of the database, includ-
ing the column headers. Then click the Data Form button.
Figure A-3 shows the appearance of the Data Form when you open it with the 
whole database selected. Excel fills in the field names automatically, and the 
fields populate with the values from the first record. You can use the form to 
navigate through the database, and you can use it to add a record. You can 
start with one record and use the New button to enter all the rest, but for me 
it’s easier to just type each record. 
 
Figure A-3: 
The Data 
Form for 
working 
with Excel 
databases.
 
Whenever you add records (and whichever way you add them), be sure to 
click Formulas | Manage Names and increase the cell range attached to the 
database name.
 
The title on the Data Form is the same as the name on the bottom tab of the 
worksheet. So it’s a good idea to put the name of the database on the tab. It’s 
clearer what the Form shows when something like “Satellites” is in its title 
rather than “Sheet 1.”
Pivot Tables
A pivot table is a cross-tabulation — another way of looking at the data. You 
can reorganize the database, and turn it (literally) on its side and inside out. 
And you can do it in any number of ways.
For example, you can set up a pivot table that has the satellites in the rows 
and a planet in each column, and has the data for orbital period inside the 
cells. Figure A-4 shows what I mean.

415
 Appendix A: When Your Worksheet Is a Database
 
Figure A-4: 
A pivot table 
of the satel-
lites data 
showing 
satellites, 
planets, 
and orbital 
period.
 
Figure A-5 shows a pivot table that presents another view of the data. This 
one takes the spotlight off the individual satellites and puts it on the planets. 
Each planet’s row is divided into two rows — one for the Orbital Period and 
one for the Average Distance. The numbers are the sums across each planet’s 
satellites. Adding up the Orbital Period for all of Jupiter’s satellites gives you 
29.66, for instance.
 
Figure A-5: 
Another 
pivot table

lites data,

This example focuses on creating the pivot table in Figure A-4. Creating pivot 
tables in Excel 2007 is easier than in earlier versions. Before, you 

416
Statistical Analysis with Excel For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
went through a number of steps as you worked via a wizard. Now, here’s 
what you do:
 
1. Open the worksheet that holds the database.
 
 In this case, it’s Satellites.
 
2. Select any cell in the range of the database.
 
3. Select Insert | Pivot Table to open the Create Pivot Table dialog box 
(See Figure A-6).
 
Figure A-6: 
The Create 
Pivot Table 
dialog box.
 
 
4. Make your entries within this dialog box.
 
 Because I selected a cell within the database before I opened this dialog 
box, the first radio button is selected and the Range box is filled in.
 
 I selected the radio button next to New Worksheet to put the pivot table 
on a new worksheet.
 
5. Click OK.
 
 The result is the Pivot Table Layout on a new worksheet. (See 
Figure A-7.) 
 
6. Populate the Pivot Table Layout.
 
 To populate the PivotTable Layout, you select a field from the 
PivotTable Field List, drag it into the appropriate box below, and drop it. 
 
 I begin with the rows. To make the names of the satellites appear in the 
rows, I selected Name and dropped it into the Row Labels box. Figure 
A-8 shows the result. In addition to the satellite names in the rows, the 
checkbox next to Name is bold and checked, to indicate it’s in the table. 
Unchecking the checkbox removes Name from the table.

into the Row 
Labels box.
 

418
Statistical Analysis with Excel For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
 
 Next, I dropped Planet into the Column Labels box. (Figure A-9.)
 
 Dragging Orbital Period (Days) from the Field List and dropping it into 
the Σ Values box results in the table shown in Figure A-4. 
 
 Dropping a field into the Report Filter box creates something like a 
multipage version of the table. For example, putting Discoverer in the 
Report Filter box creates a drop-down that allows you to see just the 
data for each Discoverer. 
 
 The down arrow next to a field opens a menu of options for sorting and 
filtering that field.
The importance of pivot tables is that they allow you to get your hands dirty 
with the data. By dropping fields into and out of the table, you might see rela-
tionships and carry out analyses that might not occur to you if you just look 
at the original database.

The Analysis of Covariance
In This Chapter
▶ Another look at covariance
▶ Why and how we analyze covariance
▶ Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) in Excel
O
ne of the major points of this book is that Excel comes with a surprising 
number of analytical tools and formulas. The toolset isn’t as extensive 
as you’d find in a dedicated statistics package, but it’s still impressive.
Some analyses, unfortunately, aren’t part of Excel. And some of those might 
turn out to be important for you. In many cases, with a little ingenuity you 
can use the existing parts of Excel to perform those analyses anyway. In this 
Appendix, I focus on one of those analyses.
Covariance: A Closer Look
In Chapter 15, I mention covariance in connection with correlation. I spoke 
about it briefly as the numerator of the correlation coefficient. I also mention 
that covariance represents two variables changing together.
What does that mean, exactly?
Imagine a group of people on whom we measure mathematical ability and 
sociability. (Let’s just assume we have valid, reliable ways of measuring 
both.) If we find that the people with high mathematical ability are the most 
sociable, and the people with low mathematical ability are the least sociable, 
this thing called covariance is numerically high and positive. This type of 
positive relationship is called a direct relationship.

420
Statistical Analysis with Excel For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
A different result is possible: The people with high mathematical ability 
might turn out to be the least sociable, and the people with low mathematical 
ability the most sociable. If that happens, covariance is numerically high and 
negative. This type of negative relationship is called an inverse relationship.
Still another result is possible. We might find no connection whatsoever 
between mathematical ability and sociability. In this case, the two variables 
are independent, and the numerical value of covariance is close to zero. It 
could be slightly positive, it could be slightly negative, but it’s close to zero.
Sounds a lot like correlation? It should. As I said, covariance is the numera-
tor of the correlation coefficient. One way to look at it is that the correlation 
coefficient puts an upper and lower bound on covariance. With a little experi-
ence, we can understand what a correlation coefficient of .98 means, or a cor-
relation coefficient of -.62. Without a lot of context, it’s hard to know what a 
covariance of 473.5 means.
Why You Analyze Covariance
So you’ve had a refresher on what covariance is. Why do we want to . . . uh . . . 
analyze it?
Let’s begin with a typical study: You randomly assign people to different 
conditions and you assess their performance under those conditions. For 
example, you might randomly assign 15 children to one of three groups that 
differ on how they prepare for a math exam. One group prepares by listen-
ing to a human instructor. Another prepares by going through an interactive 
program on a computer. The third prepares by reading a textbook. Then they 
take the exam.
The performance on the test is the dependent variable. The three preparation 
conditions make up the independent variable. The goal is usually to find out 
if the different conditions of the independent variable affect the dependent 
variable. Recall from Chapter 12 that this involves a hypothesis test that 
looks like this:
H0: μInstructor = μComputer = μText
H1: Not H0
In Chapter 12, I also point out that the appropriate statistical technique is the 
analysis of variance (ANOVA).
So far, so good. What about covariance?

421
 Appendix B: The Analysis of Covariance
In addition to the dependent variable and the independent variable, a third 
kind of variable can come into play. Here’s how. Suppose you have another 
relevant measure for each of the 15 children — mathematics aptitude. In 
addition to preparation type, this could also affect each child’s exam perfor-
mance. This third variable is called the covariate. The relationship between 
the dependent variable and the covariate is covariance.
Big shots in the field of research design and analysis have a name for ran-
domly assigning individuals to different conditions of the independent vari-
able and keeping everything else the same (like the time of day you give the 
test, the amount of time each child prepares, the amount of time each child 
has to take the test). They call this experimental control. 
They also have a name for assessing the effects of a covariate — that is, 
its covariance with the dependent variable. They refer to that as statistical 
 control. Both are valuable tools in the analyst’s arsenal.
Bottom-line question: Why do you need statistical control? Suppose you 
carry out the study and find no significant differences among preparation 
groups. This could mean that experimental control wasn’t powerful enough 
to discern an effect of preparation type. That’s when statistical control can 
come to the rescue. Suppose mathematics aptitude affected performance in 
ways that masked the effects of preparation type. That is, does the possible 
correlation of performance with aptitude affect the results?
By combining experimental control with statistical control, analysis of covari-
ance (ANCOVA) answers that question.
How You Analyze Covariance
How do you combine the two types of control? 
In Chapter 12, I point out that ANOVA separates SSTotal into SSBetween and SSWithin. 
Divide each SS by its degrees of freedom and you have three MS (variances). 
The MSBetween reflects differences among group means. The MSWithin estimates 
the population variance. It’s based on pooling the variances within the 
groups. If the MSBetween is significantly greater than the MSWithin, you can reject 
the null hypothesis. If not, you can’t. (Reread Chapter 12 if this all sounds 
strange to you.)
In ANCOVA, you use the relationship between the dependent variable and 
the covariate to adjust SSBetween and SSWithin. If the relationship is strong, it’s 
likely that the adjustment increases SSBetween and reduces SSWithin. Statistics, 

422
Statistical Analysis with Excel For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
like most other aspects of our world, feature no free lunches: The adjustment 
lowers the dfWithin by 1. It might help to think of it this way:
ANOVA: 
ANCOVA:
A possible outcome of the adjustment (if the relationship is strong) is that 
the F ratio is higher for ANCOVA than for ANOVA. In practical terms, this 
means that adding statistical control can result in a more powerful study 
(that is, greater ability to find an effect) than experimental control alone.
Here’s a way to understand ANOVA vs. ANCOVA: ANOVA helps you find a 
needle in a haystack. ANCOVA also does this, but it removes some of the hay 
from the haystack — and it makes the needle a little bigger, too.
ANCOVA in Excel
Although Excel has no built-in tools for ANCOVA, you can use what Excel 
does provide to make ANCOVA way easier than it looks in statistics books. 
What does Excel provide? When it comes to covariance, recall that the 
COVAR worksheet function does all the calculations for you, as does the 
Covariance analysis tool.
It sounds like the Covariance analysis tool is ideal for something called 
Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA). Oddly, it’s not. We also have no use for 
COVAR as we proceed. 
Instead, I show you two approaches that use other Excel features to carry out 
an ANCOVA. One approach uses the Anova: Single Factor analysis tool along 
with some worksheet functions. The other uses the Regression analysis tool 
along with some worksheet functions. 
Both approaches tackle the data in Table B-1. In both methods, I use regres-
sion slopes to express the relationship between the dependent variable and 
the covariate.

These methods are for the kind of research design I discuss in Chapter 12 
(single factor ANOVA). You can use ANCOVA for any kind of research design 
that involves ANOVA, but these two particular methods won’t work for more 
complicated designs (as in Chapter 13, for example). 
Method 1: ANOVA 
When most statistics textbooks cover analysis of covariance, they show you 
a lot of arcane-looking computation formulas designed to avoid even more 
complex-looking regression-related calculations. The result is that they often 
obscure what ANCOVA is supposed to do.
With this method, and the next one, I show you how to harness Excel’s power 
to get around all of that. My goal is to make ANCOVA a lot easier than it looks 
in stat books.
Figure B-1 shows the ANCOVA worksheet for this method. I’ll take you 
through the steps.
The data from Table B-1 are in cells B1:D13, separated into one table for the 
dependent variable data and another for the covariate data. I structured 
the data this way because I have to use the Anova: Single Factor tool on the 
dependent variable and again on the covariate. The input to the Anova tool is 
a contiguous range of cells, so the layout in Table B-1 doesn’t work.
The first thing I did was set up to calculate bwithin, a quantity I use to adjust 
the SS and to adjust group means for post-analysis testing. 

424
Statistical Analysis with Excel For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
 
Figure B-1: 
The
 Method 1 
ANCOVA 
worksheet 
for the data 
in Table B-1.
 
What is bwithin? Imagine a scatterplot for each of the three groups, and a 
regression line through each scatterplot. Each regression line has a slope. 
The value of bwithin is the average of the group slopes with each slope 
weighted by the variance of the covariate within the group. 
This might be a rare case where the formula is clearer than the words. Here 
it is:
So I used VAR to calculate the variance of each group within the covariate. 
Those variances are in row 14, labeled VarianceX. I could have run the Anova 
tool to get these variances. I did it this way for clarity. The sum of these vari-
ances, 12.4, is in cell E14.
Then I used SLOPE to calculate the slope within each group. Those are in 
row 15, labeled SlopeXY. 
Row 16, labeled VarX*SlopeXY, contains the product of each group slope 
multiplied by the variance in that group. Cell E16 holds the sum of these 
products. 
The value of bwithin is in cell B18. The formula for that cell is
=E16/E14

425
 Appendix B: The Analysis of Covariance
Cell B19 holds another slope I use for SS adjustment. It’s called btotal and it 
represents the slope of the regression line drawn through a scatterplot of all 
the scores regardless of the group they’re in. The formula for B19 is
=SLOPE(B2:D6,B9:D13)
Next, I constructed the spiffy-looking ANCOVA table in cells A21:F25. The 
objective of this whole process is to fill in this table. I formatted all the labels 
and borders to make it look something like the results of an Anova:Single 
Factor analysis. Then I filled in the sources of variation in A23:A25, and the df 
in C23:C25. The df are the same as for ANOVA, except you lose a df from the 
dfWithin, and that of course is reflected in the dfTotal.
The next order of business is to run the Anova:Single Factor analysis tool. I 
ran it once for the dependent variable and once for the covariate. Why for the 
covariate? After all, I’m not testing any hypotheses about Math Aptitude. The 
reason for an ANOVA on the covariate is that the ANOVA output provides SS 
values I need to complete the ANCOVA.
In Chapter 12, I explain how to use this tool. The only difference is that in this
case I directed the output to this worksheet rather than to separate worksheets. 
I removed some rows from the Anova tool’s outputs so that everything would 
fit into one screen shot, and I modified them a bit for clarity.
The values in the ANOVA tables enable me to fill in the ANCOVA table. The 
Adusted SSTotal is
This means that 
=I13-B19^2*I27
goes into cell B25 in the ANCOVA table. By the way, I rounded off to two deci-
mal places to make everything look nicer on this page. The worksheet has 
way more decimal places.
Next up: Adjusted SSWithin. The formula for the adjustment is 

426
Statistical Analysis with Excel For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
Numerically, that’s
So in cell B24 I put this formula
=I11-B18^2*I25
Adjusted SSBetween? That’s just 
=B25-B24
in cell B23.
I complete the ANCOVA table by dividing each Adjusted SS by its df, and then 
dividing the Adjusted MSBetween by the Adjusted MSWithin to compute F.
That last column in the ANCOVA table, P-value, is a little trick courtesy of 
FDIST. The formula in cell F23 is
=FDIST(E23,C23,C24)
Just below the ANCOVA table, I put the adjusted means for the dependent 
variable. These enter into post-analysis testing, which I cover in the section 
after the next one. For now, I’ll just tell you that each adjusted mean is
where that uppercase X with a bar over it represents the average of all 15 
scores in the covariate. 
For this example, the adjusted means are
The adjustments increase the spread among the means.
In this worksheet, the group means are in the ANOVA outputs. Specifically, 
they’re in K4:K6 for the dependent variable and in K18:K20 for the covariate. 
So the formula for the adjusted Human mean (in cell B28) is
=K4-B18*(K18-AVERAGE(B9:D13))

427
 Appendix B: The Analysis of Covariance
For the adjusted Computer mean (cell C28) it’s
=K5-B18*(K19-AVERAGE(B9:D13))
and for the adjusted Textbook mean (cell D28) it’s
=K6-B18*(K20-AVERAGE(B9:D13))
What’s the benefit of ANCOVA? Take a look at Figure B-1. Compare the result 
of the dependent-variable ANOVA (F2,12 = 2.57) with the result of the ANCOVA 
(F2,11 = 5.84). Although we sacrificed a df, the P-value shows the ANCOVA 
result is significant. The ANOVA result is not. The ANCOVA adjusted the 
SSBetween upward, and adjusted the SSWithin downward.
Bottom line: The relationship between the dependent variable and the covari-
ate enables us to uncover a significant effect we might otherwise miss. In this 
example, ANCOVA avoids a Type II error.
Method 2: Regression 
If the preceding method works, why am I bothering to show you yet another 
method? Even more important, why should you take the trouble to master it?
The reason I’d like you to read on is this. The method I’m about to show you 
asks you to change your mind-set about the data. If you can do that, you’ll 
find yourself open to another way of looking at statistical analysis and to 
mastering some new statistical concepts.
Here’s what I mean. The worksheet in Figure B-2 shows the data from Table 
B-1 in a different type of layout. The figure also shows the work for the com-
pleted ANCOVA. 
Column A has the math exam data, and column B has the math aptitude data, 
but they’re not separated into three groups as before. What’s going on here?
My plan is to treat this as a multiple regression. Exam is the dependent vari-
able, and Math Aptitude is an independent variable. But it’s not the only inde-
pendent variable.
The key is to somehow represent the group that each individual is a member 
of. Tag1 and Tag2 take care of that. If a child is in the Human Instructor 
group, Tag1 = 1 and Tag2 = 0. If a child is in the Computer group, Tag1 = 0 and 
Tag2 = 1. If a child is in the Textbook group, Tag1 = 0 and Tag2 = 0. In general, 
with k groups, k-1 columns can specify group membership in this way. Just to 
let you know, in Statistics World columns B, C, and D are called vectors, but I 
won’t go there.

428
Statistical Analysis with Excel For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
 
Figure B-2: 
The 
Method 2 
ANCOVA 
worksheet 
for the data 
in Table B-1. 
 
 
This categorization scheme works when you have the same number of indi-
viduals in each group. If you don’t, things get a little dicey.
I drew lines to separate the three groups but that’s just to clarify.
What I’ve set up is a multiple regression with a dependent variable (Exam) 
and three independent variables (Math Aptitude, Tag1, and Tag2). What I’m 
saying is that Exam score depends on Math Aptitude, Tag 1, and Tag 2.
Below the data layout, cell B18 holds SSTotalX. The formula for that cell is
=COUNT(B2:B16)*VARP(B2:B16)
meaning that I multiplied the number of scores in column B (15) by the vari-
ance in column B (treated as a population of 15 scores, hence VARP) to give 
SSTotalX, the numerator of a variance.
I also calculated btotal in cell B20:
=SLOPE(A2:A16,B2:B16)
What about bwithin? Patience.
Below those values is a table of means and adjusted means, but I’ll get to that 
later.
You might not believe this, but the analysis is almost done.

429
 Appendix B: The Analysis of Covariance
All that remains is to run the Regression analysis tool and use its results to 
complete the ANCOVA table.
In Chapter 14 I show you how to use the Regression tool. The difference here 
(as with ANOVA in Method 1) is that I directed the output to this worksheet 
rather than to a separate worksheet. For this example, the Input Y range in 
the Regression tool dialog box is A1:A16. Because this is a multiple regres-
sion, the Input X range is B1:D16.
The ANCOVA table is below the Regression output. As before, I formatted the 
whole thing, labels, rows, columns, and all. Then I filled in the df. 
I begin, as in Method 1, with the Adjusted SSTotal. Again, that’s
So this time
=H14-(B20^2*B18)
goes into cell G26.
What next? The values for the Adjusted Within row are in the ANOVA table 
for the Regression output. They’re in the row labeled Residual. That’s right — 
the Adjusted SSWithin is the SSResidual and Adjusted MSWithin is the MSResidual. 
That means 
=H13
goes into cell G25 and 
=I13
goes into cell I25. 
The Adjusted SSBetween is 
=G26-G25
in cell G24.

430
Statistical Analysis with Excel For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
I divided the Adjusted SSs by the df to produce the Adjusted MSs. Then I 
divided the Adjusted MSBetween by the Adjusted MSWithin to compute F. The 
rightmost entry, Significance F, is based on FDIST as in Method 1.
Did I forget bwithin? Nope. It’s is in the Regression output in cell G18 under 
Coefficients. It’s the regression coefficient for Math_Aptitude. I used this 
value to calculate the Adjusted Means in the Means table. After using 
AVERAGE to compute the means for the dependent variable and the covari-
ate, I put this formula into cell D24
=B24-$G$18*(C24-AVERAGE($B$2:$B$16))
and autofilled D25 and D26.
When you began reading this subsection, you might have wondered why 
I bothered to show you this method. Now that you’ve read it, you might 
wonder why I bothered to show you the first one!
After the ANCOVA
As I point out in Chapter 12, a significant F value indicates that an effect is 
somewhere within the data. It’s still necessary to zoom in on where.
Post-analysis tests come in two varieties — the kind you plan in advance, and 
the kind you don’t. The first, planned comparisons, are motivated by your 
ideas about what to expect before you gather the data. The second, post-hoc 
tests, are motivated by what looks interesting in the data you gathered.
In an ANOVA, you perform those tests on group means. In an ANCOVA, you 
adjust the group means (of the dependent variable) just as you adjust the SSs 
and the MSs. You also adjust the error term (the denominator) of the tests. 
I deal here with planned comparisons. After adjusting the means (which I did 
in each Method), the next step is to adjust the MS that goes into the denomi-
nator of the planned comparisons. I refer to the adjusted MS as and the way 
to calculate it is
in which k is the number of groups.

431
 Appendix B: The Analysis of Covariance
For our example, that’s 
In the Method 1 worksheet, I select a cell and enter
=D24*(1+(I24*2)/I25)
I can now proceed with planned comparisons as I did in Chapter 12.
From all I show you here, it looks like Method 1 has the advantage over 
Method 2. Using the ANOVA analysis tool gives you the values you need for 
the planned comparisons, and it gives you the dependent-variable ANOVA to 
compare against the ANCOVA.
With the data arranged as in Method 2, we can’t get all that information, 
can we?
Yes we can. And that sets the stage for looking at a particular statistical anal-
ysis (ANOVA) in a new way, as I mention at the beginning of Method 2.
Read on.
And One More Thing
In several chapters of this book, you see the interplay between ANOVA and 
Regression: After every regression analysis, ANOVA tests hypotheses about 
regression ideas. 
In this section, I turn things around: I take an exercise normally treatable 
via ANOVA, turn it into a regression problem, and use regression to do an 
analysis of variance. This is called the MRC (multiple regression/correlation) 
approach. It’s based on the work of psychologist/statistician Jacob Cohen, 
who in the late 1960s formulated the idea of multiple regression as a general 
system for data analysis. 
Without going into all the details, Cohen’s idea is that many kinds of data are 
expressible in the format that regression operates on. Performing a regres-
sion analysis is all that’s necessary. In effect, various statistical techniques 
then become special cases of the general system.

432
Statistical Analysis with Excel For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
The dependent variable data in Table B-1 provide an opportunity to illustrate 
this approach. With the groups identified under Tag1 and Tag2, and the Tags 
as independent variables, ANOVA is exactly the same as multiple regression.
You might already be a step ahead of me. Figure B-3 shows the data laid out 
as in Figure B-2, but with different analyses. 
 
Figure B-3: 
The 
Method 2 
ANCOVA 
worksheet 
with two 
different 
regression 
analyses.
 
I ran the Regression analysis tool twice and directed the output to this work-
sheet both times. I deleted everything but the ANOVA from each output. 
The first time I ran the tool, the Input Y Range was A2:A16 (Exam) and the 
Input X Range was C2:D16 (Tag1 and Tag2). The result is the first ANOVA 
table, just below the heading Dependent Variable. 
The second time, the Input Y Range was B2:B16 (Math Aptitude) and the 
Input X Range was C2:D16, resulting in the ANOVA table below the heading 
Covariate.
Do the numbers look familiar? They should. They’re the same as the two 
ANOVAs I ran for Method 1. The only difference, of course, is the names in 
the Source of Variance column. Rather than Between and Within, these out-
puts display Regression and Residual. 
To complete the post-analysis tests for Method 2 ANCOVA, you only need the 
ANOVA for the covariate. I show you both to illustrate the MRC approach.
You can extend the MRC approach to more complex hypothesis tests, like 
the ones I discuss in Chapter 13. When you do, it becomes a bit more compli-
cated: You have to know more about multiple regression and how it applies 
to things like interaction. In any event, the MRC approach is definitely worth 
looking into.

T
hroughout Part III, I discuss Excel capabilities for testing hypotheses. 
The general process is that you formulate a hypothesis, gather data, and 
use a statistical technique to test the hypothesis.
Famed statistician John Tukey referred to hypothesis testing as confirmatory 
data analysis. He stressed, however, the importance of another process — 
exploratory data analysis (EDA). As the name suggests, in this process you 
explore data to find and illustrate features of interest, and perhaps generate 
hypotheses to investigate further. 
Tukey catalogued a wide array of techniques for exploring sets of data 
and for presenting data sets in ways that make them easy to understand. 
In this Appendix, I show you how to use Excel to implement three of those 
 techniques.
Stem-and-Leaf
Whenever I return an exam, naturally I tell the class the mean and the stan-
dard deviation, and what a score means in terms of a letter grade. If you read 
Chapter 6, you know I do that in terms of z-scores.

434
Statistical Analysis with Excel For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
What’s missing, though, is a sense of how the distribution of exam scores 
looks. Even with a frequency distribution (Chapter 2), an individual doesn’t 
know exactly where his or her score sits in the overall distribution.
Tukey’s stem-and-leaf display is a way around this. It organizes data so that 
an entire distribution of scores is quickly and easily comprehensible. 
The display breaks each score into two components: a leaf which is usually 
the last digit of the score, and a stem which is everything else. The objective 
is to create a layout that looks like Figure C-1.
 
Figure C-1: 
A stem-and-
leaf plot.

In the display (also called a stemplot), the row labeled 9 means that all scores 
in that row are between 90 and 99. The leaves — 0, 3, 8, and 8 — in that row 
stand for scores of 90, 93, 98, and 98.
Figure C-2 shows an Excel worksheet with scores (in A1:A31), an intermediate 
display, and a stem-and-leaf display like Figure C-1. The intermediate display 
is the foundation for the stem-and-leaf display.
The first thing I did was arrange the scores in increasing order, which is how 
they appear in A1:A31. 
Next, I completed the intermediate display. I put numbers representing the 
stems in a column. That’s 90, 80, 70, 60, 50, and 40 in C4:C9. 

435
 Appendix C: Of Stems, Leaves, Boxes, Whiskers, and Smoothies
 
Figure C-2: 
An Excel 
worksheet 
with scores, 
an inter-
mediate 
table, and a 
 stemplot.
 
After that, I put the scores from column A into the appropriate row in the 
intermediate display. Here are the steps for putting the data into the row:
 
1. For an intermediate display row, select the subset of scores from the 
data column.
 
 For the first row, I selected 90–98 from column A.
 
2. Right-click the selection and choose Copy from the pop-up menu.
 
3. Select the first cell for the row where the selected scores go.
 
 I selected cell D4 to begin the first row.
 
4. Right-click the selected cell and choose Paste Special from the pop-up 
menu to open the Paste Special dialog box.
 
5. In the Paste Special dialog box, choose Transpose.
 
 This puts the selected column data into the row, with the scores in 
increasing order. 
Going through those steps for each row completes the intermediate display. 
Then I completed the stem-and-leaf display. I began by putting the stems into 
a column: 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, and 4 into C12:C17. Then I used the MOD function to 
add the leaves. The MOD function takes two arguments — a number and a 

436
Statistical Analysis with Excel For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
divisor — and returns the remainder. Here are the steps for using MOD and 
finishing the display. 
 
1. Select the first cell for the leaf row.
 
 I selected D12, the highlighted cell in Figure C-2.
 
2. From the Math & Trig menu, select MOD to open the Function 
Arguments dialog box for MOD. (See Figure C-3.)
 
Figure C-3: 
The MOD 
Function 
Arguments 
dialog box.
 
 
3. In the Function Arguments dialog box, enter the values for the 
 arguments.
 
 For Number, I want the corresponding entry in the intermediate table, 
so that’s D4. 
 
 For Divisor, I want the intermediate display number that corresponds to 
the stem. That’s cell C4. I also want C4 to be the divisor when I autofill 
the remaining cells in the row, so I press the F4 key to turn C4 into $C$4. 
 
4. Click OK to close the dialog box and place the calculated value into 
the selected cell.
 
 Figure A3-2 shows the Formula bar displaying the formula for D12:
=MOD(D4,$C$4)
 
5. Autofill the row with the same number of scores as the row in the 
intermediate table.
Complete these five steps for each row and you have a stem-and-leaf display. 
I added the label Stem and the label Leaves. 
 
To make everything look nicer for pasting to Powerpoint, I merged the cell 
holding the Leaves label with a few of the cells to its right.  

437
 Appendix C: Of Stems, Leaves, Boxes, Whiskers, and Smoothies
 
After pasting to PowerPoint, stretching the copy and enlarging the font make 
everything clearer.
Consider the stem-and-leaf display next time you have to present a distribu-
tion of scores.
Boxes and Whiskers
In Chapter 20, I describe a way of using Excel to put the standard error of the 
mean into a graph. It’s a great way of adding information to a graph that shows 
means of a dependent variable versus values of an independent variable.
Figure C-4 shows the Internet connections per district in the fictional eight-
district Farchadat County for the years 2006–2008, along with the standard 
error for each mean.

That’s the data summarized in Figure C-4. As you can see, the numbers are 
quite a bit different from year to year, even though the means are the same 
and the standard errors (particularly for 2007 and 2008) are pretty similar. 
If you had to present the information to a Farchadat audience, you couldn’t 
just show them all the numbers. That would make everyone’s eyes glaze over 
and they’d quickly lose interest. So Figure C-4 doesn’t give enough detail and 
Table C-1 gives way too much. 
What do you do?
Instead of showing the mean and the standard error, the box-and-whisker 
plot shows the minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum 
of a set of data. Statisticians refer to this set of statistics as a five-number 
 summary. 
You represent each five-number summary as a box with “whiskers.” The 
box is bounded on the top by the third quartile, on the bottom by the first 
quartile. The median divides the box. How you lay out the chart determines 
the width of the box. The whiskers are error bars: One extends upward from 
the third quartile to the maximum, the other extends downward from the 
first quartile to the minimum. 
Figure C-5 shows this. Notice that the median isn’t necessarily in the middle 
of the box and the whiskers aren’t necessarily the same length.

Surprisingly, Excel doesn’t offer a box-and-whisker chart. Instead, I show you 
how to cajole a type of Excel chart into boxes and whiskers. Full disclosure: 
The method I show you here isn’t original. It draws heavily (okay, entirely) 
from the work of Jon Peltier. Check out Jon’s Web site (peltiertech.com) 
for all kinds of great ideas.
The first order of business is to put the data into a worksheet and start com-
puting some statistics. Figure C-6 shows the worksheet and the statistics. 
I used the Mean and Standard Error to create the chart in Figure C-4. I use 
everything else to create a box-and-whisker plot for the data.
The next group of statistics holds the values for the five-number summary. 
I use MIN to find the minimum value for each year and MAX to find the 
maximum value. (See Chapter 7.) QUARTILE (Chapter 6) computes the first 
quartile and the third quartile. Not surprisingly, MEDIAN (Chapter 4) deter-
mines the median.
The final group of statistics holds the values I put directly into the box-and-
whisker plot. Why is this group necessary?

Figure C-6: 
Worksheet 
for a 
box-And-
whiskers 
plot.
 
I’m about to turn a Stacked Column chart (Chapter 3) into a box-and-whisker 
plot. In a stacked column, each segment’s size is proportional to how much it 
contributes to the size of the column. In a box-and-whisker box, however, the 
size of a segment represents a difference between one value and another — 
like the difference between the quartile and the median, or between the median 
and the first quartile. 
So the box is really a stacked column with three segments. The first segment 
is the first quartile. The second is the difference between the median and the 
first quartile. The third is the difference between the third quartile and the 
median. 
But wait. Won’t that just look like a column that starts at the x-axis? Not after 
I make the first segment disappear!
The other two differences — between the maximum and the third quartile 
and between the first quartile and the minimum — become the whiskers.
Follow these steps after you calculate all the statistics you see in Figure C-6.
 
1. Select the data for the boxes in the box-and-whisker plot.
 
 In this worksheet, that’s B21:D23. Row 20 and Row 24 don’t figure into 
this step.

441

2. Select Insert | Column | Stacked Column to add a stacked column 
chart to the worksheet.
 
 Figure C-7 shows Steps 1 and 2.
 
 Figure C-8 shows what the stacked column chart looks like after I insert it, 
delete the gridlines, and reformat and title the axes.

3. Add the whiskers.
 
 This is a lot like what I discuss in Chapter 20 when I show how to add 
standard errors to a chart. 
 
 First, I add the lower whiskers. With Series 1 selected, I click Layout | 
Error Bars and pick More Error Bars Options from the menu. 
 
 This opens the Format Error Bars dialog box. I select the Minus radio 
button, the Cap radio button, and the Custom radio button. 
 
 Then I click the Specify Value button to open the Custom Error Bars 
dialog box. Leaving the Positive Error Value as is, I specify the cell 
range for the Negative Error Value. For this worksheet, that’s B20:D20 
(Q1-Minimum). Figure C-9 shows the dialog boxes.

box and

dialog box

the lower 
whiskers.
 
 
4. Clicking OK closes this dialog box, and clicking Close closes the 
Format Errors dialog box.
 
 I follow similar steps to add the upper whiskers. This time I select 
Series 3. Then as before, I click Layout | Error Bars and More Error Bars 
Options. This time in the Format Errors dialog box I select the Plus radio 
button, the Cap radio button, and the Custom radio button. 

443
 Appendix C: Of Stems, Leaves, Boxes, Whiskers, and Smoothies
 
 Again, I click the Specify Value button to open the Custom Error Bars 
dialog box. This time, I specify the cell range for the Positive Error 
Value. That cell range is B24:D24 (Max-Q3). I click OK and Close.
 
 Figure C-10 shows what the chart looks like after these steps.
 
Figure C-10:

column 
chart with

5. Make the bottom segments disappear.
 
 To give the appearance of boxes rather than stacked columns, I select 
Series 1 (the bottom segment of each column), right-click and choose 
Format Data Series from the pop-up menu to open the Format Data 
Series dialog box.
 
 In the Format Data Series dialog box, I select Fill and click the No Fill radio 
button. Then I select Border Color and click the No Line radio button. 
 
 Clicking Close closes the dialog box. Figure C-11 shows the appearance 
of the chart.
 
6. Reformat the remaining series to complete the box-and-whiskers plot.
 
 I select Series 2, right-click and pick Format Data Series from the pop-up 
menu. I select Fill and click the No Fill radio button. 
 
 Then I select Border Color and click the Solid Line radio button. I click 
the Color Button and select black from the Theme Colors palette.
 
 I click Close, and then go through the same sequence for Series 3.
 
 After that, I delete the legend. Voilà — Figure C-12! I can add another 
data series that shows where the means are, and another that would 
allow me to connect the medians, but this is enough for now.

The box-and-whiskers plot shows important aspects of the data you can’t 
see in Figure C-4. One feature it shows is skewness (see Chapter 7): Although 
the means are identical and the standard errors pretty similar, the skewness 
differs from year to year. You see this in the position of the median within 
the box, and in the relative lengths of a box’s whiskers. The data for 2006 are 
positively skewed, the data for 2007 are negatively skewed, and the data for 
2008 are nearly symmetrical (slightly negative, to be exact). 
Another feature the box-and-whiskers plot shows is kurtosis (see Chapter 7) — 
how flat or how peaked the data are. Positive kurtosis means a frequency chart 
of the data would show a peak. Negative kurtosis means a frequency chart of 
the data would show flatness. The height of the box is the clue here. A longer 
box suggests negative kurtosis, a shorter box suggests positive kurtosis. 

445
 Appendix C: Of Stems, Leaves, Boxes, Whiskers, and Smoothies
For 2008, the data have positive kurtosis, for 2007 the data have negative kur-
tosis. For 2006, the kurtosis is positive, but less so than for 2008. Admittedly, 
kurtosis doesn’t mean much with just eight scores. With a larger number, 
around 30, this feature takes on greater importance.
What’s the point of all this? The information about skewness, at least, would 
probably cause a Farchadat analyst to look at why a particular district might 
be an outlier one year and perhaps not the next.
Data Smoothing
Statisticians typically have to look at large masses of data and find hard-to-
see patterns. Sometimes an overall trend suggests a particular analytic tool. 
And sometimes that tool, while statistically powerful, doesn’t help the statis-
tician arrive at an explanation.
And so it is with Figure C-13, a chart of home runs hit in the American League 
from 1901 until 2008. (Yes, I know — yet another baseball example. Bear with 
me. Even if you’re not a fan, I think you can appreciate the thought process.)

Statistical Analysis with Excel For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
The obvious overall trend is that as the years go by, more home runs are hit. 
Fitting a regression line confirms this idea. The equation
Home Runs = 24.325*Year – 465395
is a terrific fit to the data. The equation gives an R-Squared value of 0.91, indi-
cating that a linear model nicely describes the relationship between home 
runs and years. 
And so . . . what?
Just fitting a regression line glosses over important things within baseball — 
things both great and small that make up a baseball season, an era, a history. 
And baseball has many of those things. The objective is to get them to reveal 
themselves. 
The other extreme from the regression line is to connect the dots. That 
would just give a bunch of zigzags that likely won’t illuminate a century of 
history. 
The problem is similar to what I discuss in the preceding section — how 
to rise above the details without glossing over everything. In other words, 
summarize without eliminating too much: Get rid of the zigzags but keep 
the important peaks and valleys. How do we do this without knowing what’s 
important in advance? 
EDA helps point the way. One of Tukey’s EDA techniques is called three-
median smoothing. For each data point in a series, replace that data point 
with the median of three numbers: the data point itself, the data point that 
precedes it, and the data point that follows. Here’s a formula:
Why the median? Unlike the mean, the median is not sensitive to extreme 
values that occur once in awhile — like a zig or a zag. (See Chapter 4 if this 
sounds unfamiliar.) The effect is to filter out the noise and leave meaningful 
ups and downs. 
Why three numbers? Like most everything in EDA, that’s not ironclad. For 
some sets of data you might want the median to cover more numbers. It’s up 
to the intuitions, experiences, and ideas of the analyst. 

447
 Appendix C: Of Stems, Leaves, Boxes, Whiskers, and Smoothies
Another of Tukey’s techniques is called hanning. This is a running weighted 
mean. You replace a data point with the sum of one fourth the previous data 
point plus half the data point plus one fourth the next data point. The formula:
Still another technique is the skip mean. For this one, I let the formula tell the 
story:
Tukey provides a number of others, but I confine the discussion to these 
three.
In EDA, you don’t just use one technique on a set of data. Often, you start 
with a median smooth, repeat it several times, and then try one or two 
others. 
For the data in the scatterplot in Figure C-13, I applied the three-median 
smooth, repeated it (that is, I applied it to the newly smoothed data), hanned 
the smoothed data, and then applied the skip mean. Again, no technique (or 
order of techniques) is right or wrong. You apply what you think illuminates 
meaningful features of the data.
Figure C-14 shows part of a worksheet for all of this. I obviously couldn’t fit 
all 108 years in one screenshot, but this gives you the idea. Column A shows 
the year, column B the number of home runs hit that year in the American 
League. The remaining columns show successive smooths of the data. 
Column C applies the three-median smooth to column B, column D applies 
the three-median smooth to column C. A quick look at the numbers shows 
that the repetition didn’t make much difference. Column E applies hanning to 
column D, and column F applies the skip mean to column E. In columns C–F, 
I used the actual number of home runs for the first value (for the year 1901) 
and for the final value (for the year 2008).
Just to clue you in on how I arrived at the smoothed values, here are the 
worksheet formulas for a typical cell in each column. 

448
Statistical Analysis with Excel For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
 
Figure C-14: 
A worksheet

ing the data

For cell C3, the formula is
=MEDIAN(B2:B4)
For D3, it’s
=MEDIAN(B2:B4)
For E3
=(D2/4)+(D3/2)+(D4/4)
And for F3
=(E2/2)+(E4/2)
I autofilled each column, except for the first value and the final value. 
Next, I superimposed the numbers in column F as a series on the scatterplot. 
I formatted the series to have a solid line and no markers. Figure C-15 shows 
this. I refer to that solid line as “the smoothed line.”
 
You can easily watch the effect of each successive smoothing technique on 
the smoothed line. The key is to right-click on the plot area and choose Select 
Data from the pop-up menu. Click on the name of the data series that repre-
sents the smoothed line, edit the cell range of the series to reflect the column 
that holds the particular smoothing technique, and click OK to close the edit-
ing dialog boxes.

And now the story begins to reveal itself. Instead of a regression line that 
just tells us that home runs increase as the years go by, the highs and lows 
stimulate thinking as to why they’re there. Here’s a highly abridged version 
of baseball history consistent with the twists and turns of the smoothed line.
The low flat segment from 1901 until 1920 signifies the “dead-ball era,” a time 
when the composition of a baseball inhibited batted balls from going far 
enough to become home runs. 
As the 1920s began, however, a gentleman named George Herman Ruth (see 
Chapter 6) began whacking them out of American League ballparks with 
alarming regularity. Noting that this induced many to attend said ballparks, 
the powers that be (so the story goes) livened up the baseball to make the 
home run a more frequent event. This most likely accounts for the steady 
rise in the smoothed line until the 1940s.
Why the sudden decline after 1940? World history played a role: World War II 
took many of the best players and home-run production declined. In the late 
1940s, they came back. This provided the initial impetus for the ensuing rise 
in home runs. After that, the long-overdue diversification of the talent pool 
helped home-run output increase steadily until the beginning of the ’60s. 

450
Statistical Analysis with Excel For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
From then on, the smoothed line shows a series of peaks and valleys. A 
number of influences caused the peaks. The valleys most likely indicate 
pitchers adapting, learning, and perfecting their craft. 
First peak: 1961 brought expansion, and two new teams joined the American 
League. The League stocked the new teams with players from the established 
teams. The result was that the pool of pitchers thinned out — the number of 
talented pitchers per team declined, and batters took advantage, causing a 
sudden rise in home runs after the steady increase through the ’40s and ’50s. 
My best guess is that pitching improved, because home-run production 
declined in the late ’60s. Then the powers that be intervened again by chang-
ing the rules. The pitcher delivers the ball starting from a standing position 
on a raised area called “the mound” 60 feet 6 inches from home plate. In 
order to reduce the pitcher’s leverage and thereby increase batting produc-
tion, baseball’s overseers lowered the height of the mound in 1969. Coupled 
with another expansion that year (two additional teams), home-run produc-
tion rose again. 
In 1973, the American League (but not the National League) changed its rules 
yet again to improve batting production. Instead of letting notoriously weak-
hitting pitchers bat, the League invented the role of the designated hitter. 
The designated hitter has one job — to bat in place of the pitcher. 
With the removal of weak hitters from team batting orders, I expected 
an immediate dramatic increase in home runs. It didn’t happen that way. 
Instead, the smoothed line dips a bit and then increases steadily, if undramat-
ically, for the1970s. The introduction of the designated hitter likely affected 
baseball in a variety of ways that aren’t immediately obvious. I’m sure saber-
metricians (see Chapter 13) have addressed those possibilities. 
In 1977, the American League added two more teams, coinciding with another 
rise in home runs that continued until the early ’80s. Pitchers apparently 
adapted, and home runs declined until the early ’90s. 
Then something seems to have fueled home-run production, peaking around 
1998 when the League expanded again and added another team. Many have 
speculated on what juiced up this increase, but that’s beyond the scope of 
this discussion. As the smoothed line shows, home runs are in a period of 
decline lately. Hmmm . . .
I had a lot of fun writing this capsule summary of baseball history and show-
ing how events (as I see them) coincided with the peaks and valleys in the 
smoothed line. My knowledge is a little stronger on what might have caused 
the peaks, less so on the valleys. I assume “pitchers adapting” accounts 

451
 Appendix C: Of Stems, Leaves, Boxes, Whiskers, and Smoothies
for the valleys, but I’m not certain. Did they really adapt? If so, how? Did 
anything else have an influence? (Strike-shortened seasons, for example?) 
Knowing about the valleys causes me to form hypotheses and test them — in 
this case, perhaps, by examining other statistics from the appropriate eras. 
For completeness, I have to verify my ideas about the peaks, too.
Bottom line: Exploring and visualizing the data stimulates thought about 
what’s producing the patterns the exploration uncovers. Speculation leads to 
testable hypotheses, which lead to analysis. As Tukey said in the preface to his 
book Exploratory Data Analysis (Addison-Wesley, 1977): “The greatest value of 
a picture is when it forces us to notice what we never expected to see.” 
I don’t think he was just talking about the designated hitter.
A SMOOTH add-in for Excel
EDA should be in the toolset of every statisti-
cian. If you want to get more heavily into data 
smoothing, visit quantdec.com, the Web site of 
Pennsylvania-based Quantitative Decisions. 
Founder Bill Huber has developed a free Excel 
add-in that incorporates all of Tukey’s data 
smoothing techniques. (More than the ones I 
tell you about here.) It’s called SMOOTH. After 
you download and install it in your spreadsheet, 
SMOOTH appears in the Statistical Functions 
menu. Each time you invoke SMOOTH you can 
apply a number of techniques successively. For 
example, in one run of SMOOTH, I can apply the 
four techniques I use for the home-run data.
